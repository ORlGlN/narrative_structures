Big news: I got merch.

5
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:09,094
Y'all have been asking me since
forever to release new merch

6
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,857
because it's been a minute.

7
00:00:10,857 --> 00:00:11,690
But I have this thing where

8
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,794
if I don't do something I wanna do

9
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:13,741
to the best of my ability...

10
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:14,773
I didn't wanna just rush something,

11
00:00:14,773 --> 00:00:17,776
so for a long time I've
been working on merch.

12
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:19,558
Some quality merch.

00:00:19,558 --> 00:00:22,658

sustainable merch plan,

00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,743

is we don't just survive
life, no, we conquer life.

52

63
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:08,858

00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,799
Every bod is fine, we love everyone.

68
00:02:17,799 --> 00:02:20,057
Okay, now that's it.

69
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:20,890
Just kidding.

73
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,975
In fact, we also understand

74
00:02:24,975 --> 00:02:27,128
that empowered women empower women.

75
00:02:27,128 --> 00:02:30,450

83
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:46,843
Also, cue montage.

84
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:49,510

00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,524
Just keeps givin' and givin'.

90
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:06,914
Last but not least, something
I thought I would never sell

91
00:03:06,914 --> 00:03:09,038
because it means so much to me.

92
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:10,036
But recently I've just been like,

93
00:03:10,036 --> 00:03:11,546
yo, if it's so important to me,

94
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:13,697
I want to share it with all of you.

95
00:03:13,697 --> 00:03:14,747
I am happy to announce

96
00:03:14,747 --> 00:03:18,497
you can now buy the
official Team Super ring.

97
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,413
I have worn this for like 10 years

98
00:03:23,413 --> 00:03:25,109
and it is so important to me,

99
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:26,235
but here's the thing:

100
00:03:26,235 --> 00:03:28,586
this is limited edition, limited quant...

101
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:31,286
There is only a thousand.

102
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:35,076
I literally bought a thousand
rings and that is all.

103
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:37,843
Now if there's 12.7 million
of you on this channel alone,

104
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:39,717
so you can do the math and
add up that percentages.

105
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:40,850
You best get on it.

106
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,683
Cue montage.

00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:44,350
