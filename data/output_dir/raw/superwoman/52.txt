1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:01,451
- Are you having a good day?

2
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:02,499
I hope you're having a good day,

3
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:03,480
if you're not having a good day,

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,905
forget about all your worries

5
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,955
and let's just vibe out together

6
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:09,538
and be grateful and enjoy life.

7
00:00:12,097 --> 00:00:14,593
What up everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman

8
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:16,338
and I just came back from Kenya

9
00:00:16,338 --> 00:00:18,011
so I didn't have time to figure out

10
00:00:18,011 --> 00:00:19,432
an elaborate video, so I thought,

11
00:00:19,432 --> 00:00:22,534
"yo, let me just chill out
on this wonderful Thursday

12
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,633
and just tell you a
little bit of a story."

13
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,784
freak, is there makeup on my shirt?

14
00:00:26,784 --> 00:00:28,068
I swear to god, you know.

15
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:29,348
And let me just prep up by saying that

16
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:31,022
I don't really get drunk that often.

17
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:34,354
Says every person who
gets drunk very often.

18
00:00:34,354 --> 00:00:35,937
What up, t-shirt reference!

19
00:00:35,937 --> 00:00:38,088
One of you crazies got
this for me and I love it.

20
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:39,666
To be honest, I started drinking

21
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:41,370
really late in my life,
I wasn't one of those

22
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,942
rebellious teens that was like drinking.

23
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,268
I waited till I was of age and beyond.

24
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:46,797
I was that person that was like older,

25
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,504
trying to get crunk, all my friends

26
00:00:48,504 --> 00:00:50,650
were like married with kids
and I'm like, "jager bombs!"

27
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,425
so I'm gonna tell you some stories

28
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,146
of stupid things I've done while drunk.

29
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:56,214
Why two reasons, number
one, I can drink while

30
00:00:56,214 --> 00:00:58,841
telling this because hello, related props.

31
00:00:58,841 --> 00:00:59,846
Don't like it?

32
00:00:59,846 --> 00:01:02,206
Give me your salty tears,
I'll add it to the mix.

33
00:01:02,206 --> 00:01:04,456
And number two, your homegirl
got her period still.

34
00:01:04,456 --> 00:01:05,629
My uterus is like, blergh.

35
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,350
And so I'm like... (slurring words)

36
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,117
prepare yourself for a whole lot of this.

37
00:01:11,117 --> 00:01:13,830
Generally, I'm a happy, fun, affectionate,

38
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,036
drunk person okay, do not twisted.

39
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:18,431
I am not one of those
people that's a hot mess.

40
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:20,341
I don't cry about my exes when I'm sober,

41
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:24,341
I sure as hell ain't gonna
do it when I'm drunk.

42
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,733
Story number one.

43
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:29,826
So it's my birthday and I
rented out this private lounge

44
00:01:29,826 --> 00:01:32,128
type area and you know,
I was pretty intoxicated

45
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:35,274
but you know, I was still
walking in a straight line.

46
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:37,252
A line that's as straight
as Ellen DeGeneres.

47
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:39,318
And I don't know what came over my mind

48
00:01:39,318 --> 00:01:41,955
but I was like, "yo wait,
is this my birthday party?

49
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:44,122
Or is this a water fight?"

50
00:01:45,059 --> 00:01:46,727
I decided it was the
latter, so I was like,

51
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,080
"yo mother effers, I'm about

52
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,716
to win my birthday water fight."

53
00:01:49,716 --> 00:01:51,479
so everyone's all dressed
up really, really nice

54
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,920
and one of my friends, he's wearing like

55
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,419
a three piece suit in the corner

56
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:55,890
and I was like, oh!

57
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,564
So I pick up a water bottle in the middle

58
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,116
of this fancy party, I unscrew it,

59
00:01:59,116 --> 00:02:00,253
I walk up to him and I'm like,

60
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,448
"yo, guess who's about to win?"

61
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:06,637
I dumped the entire
water bottle on his head

62
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:08,901
and everyone's like, "what are you doing?"

63
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:11,325
and I was like, "oh wait,
is this not a water fight?"

64
00:02:11,325 --> 00:02:12,615
because in my brain, I was like,

65
00:02:12,615 --> 00:02:14,775
"yo, you be stupid not to do this."

66
00:02:14,775 --> 00:02:16,809
but that's nothing compared
to story number two.

67
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:19,438
So a couple years ago, I had a house party

68
00:02:19,438 --> 00:02:20,837
as I often do for my birthday

69
00:02:20,837 --> 00:02:21,952
because you know, then there's no parking,

70
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,081
everyone come casual, wearing track pants

71
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:25,301
and it's open bar because yo, I

72
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,736
got a lot of alcohol at my house.

73
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,879
Here's a thing about
birthdays with an open bar,

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,536
because it's your
birthday, everyone's like,

75
00:02:30,536 --> 00:02:31,762
"yo, we need to have a shot with you."

76
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:33,345
and we have like 50, 60 people there.

77
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:34,858
There's 50, 60 people that are like,

78
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:36,259
"I'm gonna have a shot with you."

79
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:39,321
and you know me, I'm like,
"okay, okay, okay, okay."

80
00:02:39,321 --> 00:02:41,283
just like the crunk Oprah, just like,

81
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:43,117
you get a shot, you get
a shot, you get a shot.

82
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:45,634
So after many shots and
many mixing of drinks,

83
00:02:45,634 --> 00:02:48,458
inevitably, I got really drunk.

84
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,759
Fun fact, my parents
were also at this party.

85
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,591
So, very early in the
night, I knocked the F out,

86
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:57,119
not in front of everyone, my
friend saw me wobbling around,

87
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,659
they took me to my room and put me to bed.

88
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,911
Let's just say, God bless my friends,

89
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,471
y'all are real ones, my friends are

90
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,686
the type of people that like,

91
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:05,343
put me in the washroom, rubbing my back.

92
00:03:05,343 --> 00:03:07,193
Be like, "yo, if you
gonna be sick, be sick now

93
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:08,199
because your mom's coming."

94
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,459
mom knock on the door like, "Lilly,

95
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:10,629
what the bloody hell happening?"

96
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,546
my friend's just like, "oh
no, Lilly's in the washroom.

97
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:14,942
Yeah no, she was just washing, I was

98
00:03:14,942 --> 00:03:16,415
helping her take off her lashes."

99
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,619
I'm just in the corner like,

100
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:18,957
(retching noises)

101
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,455
my friend's like, "yeah, no,

102
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,471
no, she's exfoliating her skin."

103
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,160
no aunty, you know what happened,

104
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,448
okay, Lilly tripped right

105
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,473
and her jeans ripped so she decides

106
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,148
to make a YouTube tutorial
about distressed jeans,

107
00:03:29,148 --> 00:03:31,686
so she's just recording that
right now in the washroom.

108
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:34,654
She actually, on a
business call, she working.

109
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:35,654
(retching noises)

110
00:03:35,654 --> 00:03:37,138
yeah, you know, that's her outro,

111
00:03:37,138 --> 00:03:38,391
she's asking them to subscribe.

112
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:41,107
My friend just pulling
out every lie in the book.

113
00:03:41,107 --> 00:03:43,243
Eventually, my parents caught on,

114
00:03:43,243 --> 00:03:45,327
I went to bed, super, super early.

115
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,274
Here's the funny part, that year

116
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:51,108
Youtube had surprised me with
this really awesome cake.

117
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:54,248
It was like a unicorn and
skittles, amazing thing.

118
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,985
I felt so bad, because I went to bed

119
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:59,001
and woke up in the morning being like,

120
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:01,587
"oh my god, I got so drunk and knocked out

121
00:04:01,587 --> 00:04:04,039
and I didn't even cut this cake

122
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,935
and in Indian families,
cutting the cake is everything.

123
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:08,946
If you don't cut the
cake, there's no birthday.

124
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:10,693
So I woke up and felt like crap

125
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:13,374
for at least six hours until I finally

126
00:04:13,374 --> 00:04:15,464
got out of bed, went through my phone

127
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,555
and found 30 pictures
of me cutting the cake.

128
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:21,653
Not only did I cut the cake, but there

129
00:04:21,654 --> 00:04:23,384
was a whole bunch of people I messaged,

130
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:25,062
being like, "yo, you didn't
even come to my birthday,

131
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:26,011
thanks for letting me know."

132
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:27,830
I had a picture with all of them

133
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,957
because they were there the

134
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:31,707
whole night and I talked to them.

135
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:33,819
Another t-shirt reference.

136
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,119
There's another time where I was at a

137
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:36,589
YouTube event and I licked Tyler Oakley.

138
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,006
To be honest, I wasn't even that drunk,

139
00:04:38,006 --> 00:04:39,664
I was like, a little,
I had like one drink,

140
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,561
I was a little tipsy, I just
wanted to taste the rainbow.

141
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:44,293
Story number four, so,
sometimes me and my friend

142
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:46,760
who shall remain unnamed,
her name's Anoshini.

143
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,242
We do stupid weird things, friends do.

144
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,375
So every once in a while, we

145
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,669
pretend to pick each other's nose.

146
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:52,675
What, don't judge me!

147
00:04:52,675 --> 00:04:53,685
We're really hot.

148
00:04:53,685 --> 00:04:55,191
So one time we were at an event

149
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,773
and we were a little bit intoxicated

150
00:04:56,773 --> 00:04:59,587
so, we were like, "yo, we dancing."

151
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:00,745
she does this thing, when you krump,

152
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:02,471
you don't realize the strength you have,

153
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,767
you're invincible in these moments.

154
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:05,967
So she's teasing me, I'm teasing her,

155
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,081
pick your nose, pick your nose,

156
00:05:07,081 --> 00:05:10,367
this girl sticks her finger
all the way up my nose.

157
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:12,725
She basically tickled my
brain and I was just like,

158
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:13,558
(gasps)

159
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:14,830
and she's like, "what
happened, what happened?"

160
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,099
I go like this, blood, everywhere

161
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:20,204
at this wedding reception,
I'm wearing a sari,

162
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:23,609
running, like a Bollywood
movie to the washrooms.

163
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:27,718
(singing in foreign language)

164
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,608
just blood everywhere!

165
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:30,831
Funniest part of this whole story,

166
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:35,629
you see her run after me in
her sari, she just like...

167
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:38,379
Would like tissues, Lilly, Lilly!

168
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:43,163
I mean, but how many people can say

169
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,164
that they got drunk and picked their

170
00:05:44,164 --> 00:05:46,091
friend's nose until they bled, not many.

171
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,173
Let's be real, this is YouTube.

172
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:48,680
There's gonna be at least 10
comments below being like,

173
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,239
"I thought I was the only one."

174
00:05:50,239 --> 00:05:53,482
YouTube, where weirdos unite!

175
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,484
Here's the thing, if you're drunk,

176
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,685
you know this and if you've never

177
00:05:55,685 --> 00:05:56,758
drank before, let me educate you.

178
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:59,751
When you're intoxicated,
you feel invincible.

179
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:02,411
Normal pains do not hurt you, you're like,

180
00:06:02,411 --> 00:06:03,669
"yo Emma, hold out, wait...

181
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:04,750
Am I Ironman?"

182
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,529
so I was dancing on my birthday party

183
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,405
and here's the thing, Brown
people, this is a boring party.

184
00:06:10,405 --> 00:06:11,935
The party gets lit when you're on

185
00:06:11,935 --> 00:06:14,641
somebody's shoulders just like...

186
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,917
(singing in foreign language)

187
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,579
so I am literally being lifted by

188
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,799
two of my friends and
sitting on their shoulders.

189
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:24,694
Obviously, the two guys
holding me are also drunk.

190
00:06:24,694 --> 00:06:26,138
As I'm dancing in the air and

191
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:27,569
being carried by two drunk men,

192
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:32,204
my head smacks against the
exit sign of the building.

193
00:06:32,204 --> 00:06:33,642
Literally like... (cracking sound)

194
00:06:33,642 --> 00:06:35,039
and everyone's like, "oh!"

195
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,038
what did I do?

196
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:36,871
Eh!

197
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,403
(sings in foreign language)

198
00:06:40,403 --> 00:06:42,326
I didn't even feel it, I was unfazed.

199
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:44,397
Story number five, six?

200
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:45,385
Five, six?

201
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:46,877
Yo, what am I, am I a mathematician,

202
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:47,842
I don't know, figure it out.

203
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:49,633
This story is actually not
something stupid I've done

204
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,457
while drunk, it's something stupid that

205
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:54,335
one of you has done while drunk.

206
00:06:54,335 --> 00:06:57,105
So I'm out with my friends,
saying overnight at a hotel,

207
00:06:57,105 --> 00:06:58,368
about to go out, about to party

208
00:06:58,368 --> 00:07:00,570
and I decided not to take my phone

209
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,109
because I'm like, "I'm not
trying to be this person.

210
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:04,949
Takes my phone to a club
and loses it and is crying,

211
00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:07,801
I need pictures, all my pictures..."

212
00:07:07,801 --> 00:07:09,404
that's right kids, if you do something

213
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,797
without taking a picture,
it still happened.

214
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:14,422
So I leave my phone at night, I go out,

215
00:07:14,422 --> 00:07:15,536
I have a great time, I come back,

216
00:07:15,536 --> 00:07:19,551
I see like 10 missed calls
from my mom and I'm like...

217
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,856
You know you see 10 missed
calls from your mom,

218
00:07:21,856 --> 00:07:23,118
it ain't ever good news.

219
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:24,373
So I call at like, four in the morning,

220
00:07:24,373 --> 00:07:25,239
I'm like, "mom, mom, what's wrong,

221
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,513
you gave me so many missed calls."

222
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,974
she starts yelling at me!

223
00:07:27,974 --> 00:07:30,158
"you're dumb and you're
stupid, I know you're drunk!"

224
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,331
I'm like, "what the
hell, you talking about,

225
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:32,891
I'm here, I'm sober, I didn't bring

226
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:36,172
my phone to the club, I was responsible."

227
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:37,869
and she's like, you called me while

228
00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:41,086
drunk, crying and swearing at me.

229
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:43,045
And I'm like, "pardon moi?"

230
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,919
apparently, one of my fans

231
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,941
drunk or pretending to be drunk,

232
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:51,024
called my house, pretending to be me.

233
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,404
To be honest though, my mom
didn't believe it was me

234
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:58,050
because hello, if I'm drunk,
why would I be calling my mom

235
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,068
of all people, that was the first sign.

236
00:08:00,068 --> 00:08:02,787
My mom just like, "oh no,
okay, if this was really Lilly

237
00:08:02,787 --> 00:08:05,014
and she was drunk, she would be telling me

238
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,495
she was at the library, doing

239
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:07,722
an all girls group assignment.

240
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:08,899
she wouldn't be calling me, this ho

241
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:11,290
would be pretending to
be sober, lying to me."

242
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:14,072
and I'm like, "mom, you
right, you so right.

243
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,443
You know me so well, I love you."

244
00:08:16,443 --> 00:08:18,817
and this is like, near
the end of the video

245
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,295
so I guess I should probably be like,

246
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,579
"yo, disclaimer, disclaimer, and stuff,

247
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,642
drink responsibly, don't drink underage,

248
00:08:23,642 --> 00:08:26,892
you know, stay in school, don't litter,

249
00:08:28,693 --> 00:08:30,029
save the whales!"

250
00:08:30,029 --> 00:08:31,757
also, you should
subscribe, I mean this one

251
00:08:31,757 --> 00:08:33,385
is significantly less important

252
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:34,964
than all the things I said
previously, but you already here.

253
00:08:34,965 --> 00:08:35,986
Do the thing, click the button,

254
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:37,328

255
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:38,988

00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:40,609
that people say at the end of videos

257
00:08:40,609 --> 00:08:43,143
where they, they video so,
everyone videos so well.

258
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:45,327
Also wait, before you
go, look at this thing,

259
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:47,425
this design thing that
just came on screen,

260
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:48,706
are you kidding me?

261
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:51,452
That's my Twitter and
Instagram, why you slacking?

262
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:54,619
It's lit over there, squad AF, fleeky?

263
00:08:56,644 --> 00:08:59,323
Okay, go to the end card, get out of here.

264
00:08:59,323 --> 00:09:01,518
Oh wait, before you go,
don't think about it,

265
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,195
wait a second, I know you do this a lot,

266
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:04,514
you watch YouTube videos
and you click away

267
00:09:04,514 --> 00:09:05,762
on all those suggested videos over there,

268
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:06,670
and you're like, "oh, let me click those."

269
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,760
nah, first of all, give

270
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,419
