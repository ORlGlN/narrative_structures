1
00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:01,127
- You should listen to me, yo.

2
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,297
I'm a relationship expert that's single.

3
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:05,132
(Christmas bells)

4
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,377
What up everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman,

5
00:00:09,377 --> 00:00:12,055
and I am not looking for
a relationship right now.

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:14,341
I have no interest in
putting my time or effort

7
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,642
into another person, nor
do I need another person

8
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:18,185
to put energy into me, okay?

9
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,264
Because that's what granola bars are for.

10
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:22,056
And even though I'm pretty
solid on that decision,

11
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:24,734
from time to time, a guy will
do something and my heart

12
00:00:24,734 --> 00:00:27,236
will try to convince my
brain to think differently.

13
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:29,406
So let me reveal to you
the five things guys do

14
00:00:29,406 --> 00:00:32,909
that girls love, AKA,
lifehacks for single men

15
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,871
to get that Netflix and chill.

16
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,289
Number one, wear distinct cologne.

17
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:39,041
Okay now, hold up, I'm sure
you've heard that before.

18
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:40,243
It's not some unique thought.

19
00:00:40,243 --> 00:00:41,293
It's not rocket science.

20
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:42,168
Let's be real.

21
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:43,879
We both live on thought catalog.

22
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:45,840
But let me explain to you
why this is so important.

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,174
You see, because women wear perfume,

24
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:48,959
and perfume smells sweet, okay?

25
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,711
Reminds you of flowers, fields, okay?

26
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:53,639
Nice sunsets, okay, perfume is basically

27
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,641
like Connor Franta's Instagram, okay?

28
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,891
It's effin' beautiful.

29
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,893
In fact, the whole experience

30
00:00:57,893 --> 00:00:59,560
of wearing perfume is very sensual.

31
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,647
All commercials that advertise
perfume are always like

32
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:04,399
a girl touching herself
with no real story line.

33
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,985
A great example is any
Miley Cyrus music video.

34
00:01:06,985 --> 00:01:10,937
♫ I came in like a wrecking ball. ♫

35
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:13,357
Perfume by Dior.

36
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:14,702
And although perfume smells great,

37
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:17,038
it also smells kind of like, delicate,

38
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:19,539
and fragile, and passive and submissive.

39
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,082
Like, straight up, if
perfume were a person,

40
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:22,834
I would imagine that
person having to fight

41
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,878
for their right to vote,
and that's annoying.

42
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,746
I mean like, straight up,
even I wanna ask a bottle

43
00:01:26,746 --> 00:01:28,749
of Chanel to go make me a sandwich.

44
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:30,667
But cologne, on the other hand, no no no,

45
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,543
cologne smells like confidence, okay?

46
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:34,004
Like power.

47
00:01:34,004 --> 00:01:36,432
Cologne smells like you
just hit a three-pointer,

48
00:01:36,432 --> 00:01:38,008
won the game, and now Drake is gonna

49
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,476
write a rap lyric about you.

50
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,102
♫ Step curd with the shot, Boy! ♫

51
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:42,062
And that's hot.

52
00:01:42,062 --> 00:01:43,564
So it's hard for a woman to be around you

53
00:01:43,564 --> 00:01:45,900
and ignore that scent of victory, okay?

54
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,442
And chances are, if she's pissed at you,

55
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:50,158
she'll still be captivated
by the amazing scent

56
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:52,170
of your cologne.

57
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,824
I saw you check her out!

58
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,108
- No, I wasn't even looking at her.

59
00:01:55,108 --> 00:01:56,201
- I saw you!

60
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:57,660
- (sighs) Lilly, I wasn't
even looking at her.

61
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,829
- I saw you with my own eyes, Dom.

62
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,748
- Fine, okay, I'm sorry, alright?

63
00:02:01,748 --> 00:02:03,124
I'm sorry.

64
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:04,500
- Don't even touch me!

65
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,703
Get away from me!

66
00:02:05,703 --> 00:02:06,503
- (sighs) Fine.

67
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:07,462
- Get over here!

68
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:08,505
Just..

69
00:02:08,505 --> 00:02:09,922
- Uh, okay, I'm sorry.

70
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,257
- Don't touch me!

71
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:13,761
Get, get away from me!

72
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,011
- Ow, ow, that's my neck.

73
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:17,472
- You smell like a miracle, dammit!

74
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,848
Not to mention, girls actually

75
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:20,641
remember how guys smell.

76
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,426
True story, I can not
tell you how many times

77
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:24,604
I've hugged a guy and
been like, "Oh, my God.

78
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:27,107
"He smells like my ex."

79
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:28,775
And then I'm like, "Finish him!"

80
00:02:28,775 --> 00:02:31,945
(fighting exhalations)

81
00:02:31,945 --> 00:02:33,697
What up t-shirt reference. (laughing)

82
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:34,572
J.K., J.K.

83
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:35,615
No, but for real, that's the type

84
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:37,451
of effed up brainwashing you need.

85
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:39,243
Number two, children.

86
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:40,614
Now let me make one thing clear.

87
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,698
I do not want kids right now.

88
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:44,115
I have absolutely no desire

89
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:46,793
to pop a human being out of my vajayjay,

90
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:48,670
and then having to get my
vajayjay all stitched up.

91
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,421
You know why?

92
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:50,956
Because snitches get stitches,

93
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:53,174
and my vajayjay didn't
say a damn thing, okay?

94
00:02:53,174 --> 00:02:54,168
It's that simple.

95
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:54,836
And you know what?

96
00:02:54,836 --> 00:02:56,052
Maybe one day I will want kids,

97
00:02:56,052 --> 00:02:58,921
just like maybe one day
I'll actually update

98
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,599
my computer software and not
click remind me tomorrow.

99
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,226
But today is not that day.

100
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:04,103
I mean, don't get me wrong.

101
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,728
I love kids in small doses.

102
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:06,981
I mean, I love my nephews.

103
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:08,398
But I ain't trying to be a mom.

104
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,526
So then, why is it that when I see a man

105
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:12,651
interacting with a child, suddenly my mind

106
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,315
views him as the father to
my hypothetical children?

107
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:16,615
I swear to God, why does this happen?

108
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:17,574
Is this just me?

109
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,784
Because I feel like a man

110
00:03:18,784 --> 00:03:19,943
with a baby attached to him

111
00:03:19,943 --> 00:03:21,077
could be like a Pokemon character.

112
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:23,489
Straight up, just like,
"I play Fatherhood."

113
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,999
And I'mma be over here
like, "Ahh, Pika Pika!"

114
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:27,625
It's effin' wizardry.

115
00:03:27,625 --> 00:03:29,544
- Hey, sweetie, how are you?

116
00:03:29,544 --> 00:03:30,664
Oh my gosh, you're so adorable.

117
00:03:30,664 --> 00:03:32,004
You know Uncle Dom loves you, right?

118
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,466
- [Lilly] Oh my God, he is so cute.

119
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:35,967
- Christmas presents and we just,

120
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,511
we're just gonna have a blast.

121
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:39,054
- [Lilly] Were his eyes always that nice?

122
00:03:39,054 --> 00:03:40,221
- Growing up so fast.

123
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,682
- [Lilly] Has he been working out?

124
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:43,892
Wait, wait, should I marry this guy?

125
00:03:43,892 --> 00:03:45,017
- Give me a kiss.

126
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:47,311
- [Lilly] Oh my God, he'd
make such a good father.

127
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,396
Just look at him.

128
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:49,440
- Come on, give me a kiss.

129
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,524
Don't do that.

130
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:52,316
- [Lilly] Wait, what's
happening down there?

131
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,443
- You're just so cute!

132
00:03:53,443 --> 00:03:55,027
- [Lilly] Oh my God, I
bet you he could assemble

133
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,614
IKEA furniture with his eyes closed.

134
00:03:57,614 --> 00:03:58,981
- Uncle Dom loves you.

135
00:03:58,981 --> 00:04:00,483
- [Lilly] (sighs) And then
we could live on a farm

136
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:01,910
and we could be known as that cool family

137
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,787
that lives on a farm.

138
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,079
- Okay, I love you, sweetheart.

139
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,457
- And we'd only use organic baby food.

140
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:09,333
(moans) This is everything I want.

141
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,254
Let's make a baby.

142
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,631
But, do not be confused,

143
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,675
because this effect slash spell

144
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,385
only lasts for about 60 minutes, okay?

145
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:21,480
You better milk it for as long as you can.

146
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,213
- So, about that baby.

147
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:25,434
- Baby?

148
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:26,184
Ew, what?

149
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,810
Get away from me, don't touch me.

150
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,354
- Yeah, I didn't wanna do that either.

151
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,731
- Tired.

152
00:04:30,731 --> 00:04:32,482
Don't be trying to bring up no kids

153
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,143
in no normal situation, okay?

154
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:35,896
If the child is not present,

155
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,569
no booty for you, okay, boy?

156
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,322
Okay, honestly, and to
answer your question, yes.

157
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,358
I would make out with
you in front of the child

158
00:04:41,358 --> 00:04:42,576
if that's what you're thinking, okay?

159
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:43,817
Don't judge me, okay?

160
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,786
Kids need to learn about the
human body at some age, okay?

161
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,288
What better age than three?

162
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:48,415
I talk so much crap.

163
00:04:48,415 --> 00:04:49,666
I would never do that.

164
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,126
I sound like a man, man, man,

165
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,880
man, ma, hello, my name is Bob.

166
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,800
Number three, move that body, boy.

167
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,845
Can I just say that there
is no greater turn-on

168
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,721
than a man that can dance well?

169
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,932
There is very few problems
that that can't solve.

170
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,512
I can not believe you
forgot our anniversary.

171
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,522
- Alright, well, I apologize, okay?

172
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,273
Come on.

173
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:14,524
- Okay, that's not gonna work again.

174
00:05:14,524 --> 00:05:16,066
This is a different part of the video.

175
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,569
- (sighs) Fine.

176
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:19,280
(dance music)

177
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,115
♫ Is it too late now to say sorry?

178
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,995
♫ 'Cause I'm missing
more than just your body.

179
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:32,710
♫ Is it too late now to say sorry?

180
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,412
♫ Yeah, I know that I let you down.

181
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:38,089
♫ Is it too late to say sorry now?

182
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,136
♫ I'm sorry, yeah.

183
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:47,933
♫ I'm sorry, yeah.

184
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:51,978
♫ Sorry. ♫

185
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,062
- Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go

186
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,023
get a tattoo of D-Trix on my bosom.

187
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:56,809
Number four, food.

188
00:05:56,809 --> 00:05:58,693
Now this could include bringing us food,

189
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:01,571
making us food, ordering us food,

190
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:03,489
whatever, as long as it involves you

191
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,193
allowing food to enter my world.

192
00:06:06,193 --> 00:06:07,744
Because honestly, it says a lot when a man

193
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,530
understands his place in my life.

194
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,955
It goes food,

195
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,458
Game of Thrones,

196
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:15,501
him, slash all my friends
that I complain to about him.

197
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,753
- Hey babe, I wanted to talk

198
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,504
to you about something.

199
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:19,831
Oh, you're eating.

200
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:20,625
You know what?

201
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,508
It's okay, we can talk about it later.

202
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,177
- Thanks, babe.

203
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,304
- But, babe,

204
00:06:26,596 --> 00:06:27,931
did you want fries with that?

205
00:06:27,931 --> 00:06:30,934
(heartbeat)

206
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,268
- Come here!

207
00:06:34,637 --> 00:06:37,524
No one has ever understood me like that.

208
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:38,650
- Yeah, and I can get you, like, ketchup

209
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,943
and mayo on the side, 'cause
it's your favorite, right?

210
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,653
(light piano music)

211
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,447
- It's overwhelming.

212
00:06:44,447 --> 00:06:45,365
Marry me.

213
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:46,450
- What?

214
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:49,537
- (hoots) That might have
been the sexiest scene

215
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:51,989
I've ever included in a video.

216
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:53,823
Is it hot in here?

217
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,710
Number five, thumbs.

218
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,335
And by that, I mean clicking
the thumbs-up button.

219
00:06:58,335 --> 00:06:59,462
What the hell were you thinking?

220
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:00,880
Okay, to be fair, you liking this video

221
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,591
might just be something
that, like, I like,

222
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,508
but like, yo, hey you, yo,

223
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,385
how you doin', huh?

224
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:07,637
Let's get to know each other.

225
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,097
And some other quick ones include

226
00:07:09,097 --> 00:07:10,548
not peeing on the toilet seat,

227
00:07:10,548 --> 00:07:12,558
being funny, playing the guitar,

228
00:07:12,558 --> 00:07:15,186
being David Beckham, wearing just a towel,

229
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:16,605
driving a manual car,

230
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:18,148
knowing how to properly hold a fork,

231
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:19,607
knowing how to properly hold me,

232
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:21,892
being WWE World Heavyweight Champion.

233
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:24,812
♫ And these are a few
of my favorite things. ♫

234
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:26,197
But yo, this is just my opinion.

235
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:27,448
At the end of the day, straight up,

236
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,825
don't change yourself for anyone,

237
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:30,536
not even someone you're
in a relationship with,

238
00:07:30,536 --> 00:07:31,618
because, can I just tell you?

239
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,204
There's more than enough hours in the day

240
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:36,041
and hot strangers on Instagram
for us single people.

241
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,750
So, don't stress about it too much.

242
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:41,010
Hope you enjoyed that video with

243
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:41,949

258
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:01,774
One luh,

259
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,609
- [Both] Superwoman,

260
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,526
- That is a wrap, and zoop!

261
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,862
You nailed that!

262
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:06,779

263
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:07,363

I'm sorry.

265
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:10,609
- I sound like I swallowed
Caitlyn Jenner's sex change.

266
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,160
Like, I swallowed her sex change, like,

267
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,578
what am I?

268
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:14,725
Lilly or Louie?

269
00:08:14,725 --> 00:00:00,000
You decide.
