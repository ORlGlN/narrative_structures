1
00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,325
- Do you ever stop what you're doing

2
00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:05,492
in the middle of the day
and just think, I'm a moron.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,998
What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Super Woman.

4
00:00:09,998 --> 00:00:11,982
And I've been through
years and years of school

5
00:00:11,982 --> 00:00:13,506
but I still feel like I
don't know how to function

6
00:00:13,506 --> 00:00:16,139
like a proper human
being in the real world.

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:17,523
Like every once in awhile, I have no idea

8
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:19,221
how to do a simple task.

9
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:21,395
Like I literally just walk
past my degree on the wall

10
00:00:21,395 --> 00:00:22,800
and I'm just wondering like how the eff

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,116
do I still get lost in
Ikea every damn time?

12
00:00:26,116 --> 00:00:28,122
And how can I never remember
where I park my car?

13
00:00:28,122 --> 00:00:30,072
And I never have enough Icloud storage.

14
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:31,604
Mostly because I don't know what that is.

15
00:00:31,604 --> 00:00:34,696
That's because sometimes, aka
very likely, aka like Monday

16
00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:38,342
to Friday, school teaches
kids useless things.

17
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:39,747
I'm just saying, school should prepare you

18
00:00:39,747 --> 00:00:41,483
for real world struggles.

19
00:00:41,483 --> 00:00:42,848
Number One, Mathematics.

20
00:00:42,848 --> 00:00:45,205
I'm lost in a strange
place and my phone is dead,

21
00:00:45,205 --> 00:00:46,038
what do I do?

22
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,595
Recite your nine times
tables said no one ever.

23
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:51,163
Let's just be real, most of
the math you learn in school

24
00:00:51,163 --> 00:00:54,051
is completely useless in everyday life.

25
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:55,757
Today we're gonna learn how to measure

26
00:00:55,757 --> 00:00:57,665
the circumference of a circle.

27
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,738
The diameter of a circle.

28
00:00:59,738 --> 00:01:02,297
The radius of the trigonometry.

29
00:01:02,297 --> 00:01:06,823
The length of this side of
this triangle, the hypotenuse.

30
00:01:06,823 --> 00:01:09,847
Math is also going to include letters now.

31
00:01:09,847 --> 00:01:11,552
Okay, math is now pretty little letters.

32
00:01:11,552 --> 00:01:12,579
Fall for A.

33
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:13,412
Parabola.

34
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:18,229
Two parabolas, parabola, two parabolas.

35
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:20,722
Acute angles.

36
00:01:20,722 --> 00:01:21,716
- Aww, cute.

37
00:01:21,716 --> 00:01:22,549
- Trapezoids.

38
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,382
- Eh!

39
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,445
- And the equation of
this hexagon cole sign

40
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:27,584
parallelogram tangent isosceles.

41
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:28,615
Any questions?

42
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:29,761
And because school fills your head

43
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:31,700
with all these complex
equations when it comes

44
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,380
to simple everyday math,
you're an idiot box.

45
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,374
That was so good.

46
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:36,409
I need to like unbutton my pants.

47
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,395
Oh thank you.

48
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:39,053
Oh actually can we split the bill?

49
00:01:39,053 --> 00:01:41,156
- No sorry, not for parties over two.

50
00:01:41,156 --> 00:01:42,528
- Oh.

51
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:45,748
- Bust out your calculators everybody.

52
00:01:45,748 --> 00:01:46,581
Who got the steak?

53
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:48,087
- Depends, how much was it again?

54
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:49,078
- What do you mean how much was it?

55
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:50,190
Doesn't matter how much,
did you get the steak

56
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,186
or did you not get the steak?

57
00:01:51,186 --> 00:01:52,218
- I honestly think it's
just like $30 each.

58
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,126
- Yo, I didn't drink.

59
00:01:53,126 --> 00:01:54,125
Both of you did.

60
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:55,115
- Also, yeah, you got guac on the side.

61
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,528
- Guac isn't extra.

62
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:58,607
- Guac is always extra, shut your mouth

63
00:01:58,607 --> 00:02:00,374
- Does it include tip yet?

64
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:01,207
- No.

65
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:02,109
So we have to tip individually.

66
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:02,942
Let's just tip individually.

67
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:03,775
Cash, credit card, what are you doing--

68
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:05,538
- Let's just call it 20 bucks each.

69
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:07,866
- All right, but this includes gratuity.

70
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:11,131
- Okay, okay, I loved that movie.

71
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,835
- That's Ratatouille,
ho, this is gratuity.

72
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,716
Boy, you stupid.

73
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,042
- Okay, we're like $80 short.

74
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:19,648
- How?

75
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:20,727
- Because of the tax.

76
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:21,720
- What the hell is tax?

77
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,915
- Hold up, I didn't carry the one.

78
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,564
- What's the standard, is it 13%?

79
00:02:24,564 --> 00:02:25,971
- Plus it, divided by two--

80
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,962
- Can we get some graph
paper, just can we?

81
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:30,644
If I had a dollar for
every time my friends and I

82
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:32,952
could not figure out the
division of the bill,

83
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,511
I would have enough money to
just pay for the whole meal.

84
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,582
Because me stupid.

85
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,479
Number two: foreign languages.

86
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,138
Growing up in Canada,
I had to learn French.

87
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:43,210
(speaks foreign language)

88
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,867
So for nine years of
my life, I had to learn

89
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:45,941
this as a second language.

90
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,310
So tell me why the
biggest language barrier

91
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,327
I have ever faced while
traveling is in France

92
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:54,795
because I had no idea what
the F anyone was saying.

93
00:02:54,795 --> 00:02:55,877
Why you ask?

94
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:56,950
Because ...

95
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,941
(speaks foreign language)

96
00:02:58,941 --> 00:02:59,978
Welcome to your first day of French class.

97
00:02:59,978 --> 00:03:03,866
Today we're going to learn
all about pizza toppings.

98
00:03:03,866 --> 00:03:06,885
How to conjugate the verb to jump.

99
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:09,366
(speaks foreign language)

100
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,722
Today's lesson, circus terms.

101
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:14,365
(speaks foreign language)

102
00:03:14,365 --> 00:03:16,128
(speaks foreign language)

103
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:16,961
No no.

104
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,711
(speaks foreign language)

105
00:03:18,711 --> 00:03:20,454
(speaks foreign language)

106
00:03:20,454 --> 00:03:23,954
(speaks foreign language)

107
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,707
- How do you say, I need help?

108
00:03:29,524 --> 00:03:31,007
- You know what they
should teach you in school?

109
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,981
How to understand foreign languages

110
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:36,080
you will see in your daily life.

111
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,926
- Wait, can you park here?

112
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:40,786
- It says I can park here
between noon and three.

113
00:03:40,786 --> 00:03:41,818
- Okay, so you're good.

114
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:43,230
- Oh wait, but it also
says not on Mondays.

115
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,539
And on days that have a T in it.

116
00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:46,531
- Think you're good.

117
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:49,512
- Also not during street cleaning
or during a quarter moon.

118
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:50,505
- I think you're good.

119
00:03:50,505 --> 00:03:52,250
- And by permit only at 5 p.m.

120
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,243
- We're good.

121
00:03:53,243 --> 00:03:54,934
- And I think it's a tow
away zone on Saturdays.

122
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,340
- We're still good.

123
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,423
- Okay, dope.

124
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,980
Oh no wait, forgot my phone.

125
00:04:04,816 --> 00:04:05,649
What the F?

126
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,457
Reading parking signs 101.

127
00:04:07,457 --> 00:04:10,133
I'm just saying, this the
type of education we need.

128
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,266
(speaks foreign language)

129
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:12,099
Worksheets.

130
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:14,191
You don't know what
frustration or inner turmoil is

131
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:17,180
in life unless you've had to cut out

132
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,564
those geometric paper shapes
and glue them together

133
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,720
to make 3D shapes.

134
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,826
You know exactly what
the F I'm talking about

135
00:04:24,826 --> 00:04:26,893
with the effin' tabs and
the effin' gluestick.

136
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:29,257
I just can't, I'm sweating,
I'm literally sweating

137
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:30,210
just thinking about it.

138
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,100
In today's day and age that
whole process makes no sense.

139
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,052
All right, students, now
today I want you to cut out

140
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:38,090
these shapes and then
glue these shapes together

141
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,590
to make 3D shapes.

142
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:41,966
It's important you learn how to do this

143
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,909
because 3D printers will never exist.

144
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:47,417
And then I want you to answer
questions about the shapes.

145
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,728
- What if I already know how
many sides are on a cube?

146
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:50,715
- Make the cube.

147
00:04:50,715 --> 00:04:53,522
- I can literally just
count the sides of the cube

148
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:54,511
without building it.

149
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,844
- Make the cube.

150
00:05:01,555 --> 00:05:03,699
- I'm done with my sphere.

151
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:04,899
- Hey, make the cube.

152
00:05:04,899 --> 00:05:07,261
Instead of giving me worksheets
full of mindless work,

153
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:11,097
teach me how to work
with sheets in real life.

154
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:13,680
(upbeat music)

155
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,303
(screams)

156
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:39,872
Number four, dress codes.

157
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,902
Now I'm gonna be straight up.

158
00:05:40,902 --> 00:05:43,045
The only dress code I had
in my school growing up

159
00:05:43,045 --> 00:05:44,318
was no gang signs.

160
00:05:44,318 --> 00:05:46,340
Yeah, that should put a lot
of things in context for you.

161
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,034
But today dress codes in schools
are absolutely ridiculous

162
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,024
and not at all a good reflection of what

163
00:05:51,024 --> 00:05:52,680
the real world is.

164
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,421
Class as you can see,
this young lady's skirt

165
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,731
is one inch too short
and I'm not woke enough

166
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:01,344
to realize this dress code
is sexist, so, go home.

167
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:03,687
Tuck in that shirt, young man.

168
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:06,287
Pull up those pants,
sir, this isn't a yolo.

169
00:06:06,287 --> 00:06:07,370
Hey, no hats.

170
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:10,562
Looks like your top is one
centimeter above your mid drift.

171
00:06:10,562 --> 00:06:12,428
We don't want the male students

172
00:06:12,428 --> 00:06:14,286
to lose focus, now do we?

173
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,522
Schools you have failed as educators

174
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:19,143
if you drill a dress code
into your students' minds

175
00:06:19,143 --> 00:06:21,502
and then they graduate
and after they graduate

176
00:06:21,502 --> 00:06:23,197
they get invited to events.

177
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:25,220
And they still don't know what the F

178
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,611
is appropriate attire to wear.

179
00:06:27,611 --> 00:06:29,710

Goodday, sir, my name is business casual.

194
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:03,087
That's what they should teach in school.

195
00:07:03,087 --> 00:07:04,783
Okay, I don't give an F
what to wear in math class.

196
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,313
Tell me what to wear to a wedding.

197
00:07:06,313 --> 00:07:09,903
To a meeting, to a social,
also, what the F is a social?

198
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:12,498
Since when is social a noun?

199
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,351
First of all, what, what, what?

200
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,573
But real talk, can I
just be real with you.

201
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:19,481
I know how school feels.

202
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,628
Everyone going back to school.

203
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:23,124
It is true, a lot of the specific things

204
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:27,709
you learn in school, you will
never ever use in your life.

205
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:30,758
But hear me when I say, you
will use the time management,

206
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:33,112
social skills, the work ethic skills.

207
00:07:33,112 --> 00:07:35,389
All the life skills
you learn through being

208
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,665
in that environment, you will learn.

209
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,697
So you know what?

210
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:42,121
Tough it out, figure out the
God damn hypotenuse, okay?

211
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:44,053
I promise it'll be worth it one day.

212
00:07:44,053 --> 00:07:45,803
Kill it, hustle hard.

213
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:49,503
Oh you you, stop stop,

214
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,278

don't even think about,
