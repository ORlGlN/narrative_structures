1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:02,108
- Damn. Two branded videos in a row.

2
00:00:02,108 --> 00:00:03,413
Girl, get it.

3
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:05,663
(neighing)

4
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:07,607
What up everyone?

5
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:08,503
It's ya girl, Superwoman.

6
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:09,920
Aight, so you feel bad because you keep

7
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,115
slacking and making the same mistake.

8
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:14,682
Listen I've been feeling really guilty.

9
00:00:14,682 --> 00:00:16,215
And I just want to start
by saying I'm sorry

10
00:00:16,215 --> 00:00:18,094
and I know you've heard
this before but I am.

11
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:19,035
- Um.

12
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,799
- I've been neglecting
you and I don't want to.

13
00:00:20,799 --> 00:00:21,755
- Okay.

14
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:22,692
- And I keep saying I want to make

15
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:24,414
time for you but then I don't.

16
00:00:24,414 --> 00:00:25,983
- Lilly, I don't feel any.

17
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,614
- I just, I come home
from work and I'm tired.

18
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:28,835
You know, I'm tired.

19
00:00:28,835 --> 00:00:29,948
- I really.

20
00:00:29,948 --> 00:00:32,642
- From now on, okay, when I come home,

21
00:00:32,642 --> 00:00:34,364
I'm gonna hold you with my hands.

22
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:37,414
I'm gonna wrap my hands around
you and I'm gonna lift you.

23
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:41,687
- Oh. I didn't realize you, I
just thought we were friends.

24
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:43,125
- Move. What's happening to you?

25
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:43,958
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:48,584
It is a scientific fact that working

27
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:49,895
out is practically impossible.

28
00:00:49,895 --> 00:00:51,694
Earlier this month I heard
my Spanx crying in the middle

29
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:54,290
of the night and I felt bad
enough to finally work out.

30
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,540
It took me about a week to prep for it.

31
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:02,410
- Uh, what are you doing?

32
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,844
- Buying underwear to work out in.

33
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:04,888
- Online?

34
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:06,457
- Yeah. I'm too lazy to go in person

35
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,487
so I figured like
amazon.com/mycalvins son.

36
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:10,320
- Wait, hold on.

37
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,921
Why do you need Calvin Klein
underwear to work out in?

38
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:15,687
- Hello. Because I'm gonna
be a fit person soon, okay?

39
00:01:15,687 --> 00:01:16,848
And fit people always take pictures

40
00:01:16,848 --> 00:01:19,565
with their Calvin Klein
underwear band showing.

41
00:01:19,565 --> 00:01:21,677
Don't you stalk sexy people on Instagram?

42
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:22,510
- Wait. Hold on.

43
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,343
One second.

44
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:24,351
Just because you're trying to work out

45
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,684
that doesn't mean you're gonna become

46
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:28,000
some kind of Instagram model or something.

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,428
- You know what?

48
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:31,483
I'm sick of you never
believing in me, okay?

49
00:01:31,483 --> 00:01:32,316
- You know what?

50
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:33,275
Whatever. I can't.

51
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:36,192
- I have bad friends in my Calvins.

52
00:01:39,272 --> 00:01:40,828
Once I finally bought all
the clothes and equipment

53
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:42,804
I needed and figured out
like a cute hairstyle

54
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:43,930
and made all these workout charts,

55
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,574
ooh got one of those
like fancy water bottles,

56
00:01:45,574 --> 00:01:48,196
it was time to go beast mode.

57
00:01:48,196 --> 00:01:50,779
(upbeat music)

58
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:54,070
Are you kidding me?

59
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,232
It's too easy.

60
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:58,939
Okay. I could do like 100 of these.

61
00:01:58,939 --> 00:01:59,772
All day.

62
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:03,553
I'm tired. I'm bored.

63
00:02:05,151 --> 00:02:08,389
(upbeat music)

64
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,556
Day one. Easy.

65
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:13,283
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:14,563 --> 00:02:15,462
- What are you doing?

67
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:17,597
- Um, hello, pushups you noob.

68
00:02:17,597 --> 00:02:18,430
- You're doing them wrong.

69
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,621
You're supposed to do them
on the ground not the wall.

70
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:23,121
- Oh my god, how embarrassing.

71
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:25,706
There.

72
00:02:29,179 --> 00:02:30,012
55.

73
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:34,499
56.

74
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,978
(upbeat music)

75
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:42,757
Yeah. Should be losing
weight any minute now.

76
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,137
Yo, for real though, those 14
minutes changed my life okay?

77
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:47,220
I was a whole new person.

78
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,368
(camera noise)

79
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:51,891
Hashtag gym life.

80
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,552
Yo. Get in here quick.

81
00:02:53,552 --> 00:02:55,481
Yo. Ask me which way the beach is girl.

82
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:56,468
- I have a GPS.

83
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,493
- Nah, you just jealous of my gains.

84
00:02:58,493 --> 00:02:59,567
- You worked out once.

85
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:00,658
It doesn't happen that fast.

86
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:02,214
- You know why you call these guns?

87
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:03,132
These right here?

88
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:04,971
Cause these are fire arms.

89
00:03:04,971 --> 00:03:06,918
- You literally look exactly the same.

90
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,068
- Yo. New year, new me.

91
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,401
- It's November.

92
00:03:11,085 --> 00:03:12,502
- I'm Blogilates.

93
00:03:13,698 --> 00:03:15,171
You know and it's like working out once

94
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:17,400
really changed the way I made choices

95
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,396
and allowed me to judge
other people for theirs.

96
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:24,054
Uh, I can't believe you put
that filth into your body.

97
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:26,450
- Um, you eat donuts like every day.

98
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,861
- Okay, that was before
I started working out.

99
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:30,848
Hello? Yeah, your body's a temple.

100
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:31,848
Just saying.

101
00:03:32,961 --> 00:03:35,003
Yo it even changed the way I talk.

102
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,447
Yo do you even lift bro?

103
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:39,118
- Um, Lyft for Lilly.

104
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,748
- Yeah, that's me.

105
00:03:40,748 --> 00:03:42,671
Yo. Can we go to In-N-Out still?

106
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,551
And it turns out that working out once

107
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,634
does in fact completely validate you.

108
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,466
Yo. You follow my fitness blog yet?

109
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,299
- Your what?

110
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,248
- My fitness blog.

111
00:03:54,248 --> 00:03:56,162
My last post was about skipping leg day.

112
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:57,718
- You only worked out one day.

113
00:03:57,718 --> 00:03:59,251
- Yeah. And it was leg day.

114
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,084
- Okay. You know what?

115
00:04:00,084 --> 00:04:02,064
Lilly look, just because
you started working out once

116
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:04,730
doesn't make you some Instagram
model or a fitness guru.

117
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,563
You know what?

118
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:06,428
I can't even stand people like you,

119
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:07,914
people who think they can
get everything they want-

120
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,770
- Yo. Did you see my new
Calvin Klein campaign?

121
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:11,603
- What?

122
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:12,436
- Yeah. I'm a Calvin Klein model now.

123
00:04:12,436 --> 00:04:13,269
Check it out.

124
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,195
Underwear band.

125
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:15,363
Huh? Huh?

126
00:04:15,363 --> 00:04:16,833
- Since when?

127
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:18,139
- Since I started working out, silly.

128
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:19,365
- So you mean yesterday?

129
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:20,516
- Yeah. Can't you tell?

130
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:22,246
This is totally a branded video.

131
00:04:22,246 --> 00:04:23,268
- Oh.

132
00:04:23,268 --> 00:04:26,739
- Yeah. I cash checks in my Calvins.

133
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:29,489
(cheerful music)

134
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,492
Yep. I use filters in my Calvins.

135
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:37,560
Hold on, big news.

136
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,044
Guess what my next upload will start?

137
00:04:40,044 --> 00:04:40,877
Are you ready?

138
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:41,710
Drumroll.

139
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,643
(high pitched drum roll noise)

140
00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,365
12 collabs of Christmas.

141
00:04:44,365 --> 00:04:46,106
That's right, my very next upload

142
00:04:46,106 --> 00:04:48,022
on Thursday, November 23 is gonna mark

143
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:50,065
the start of 12 collabs of Christmas.

144
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:50,901
What the F does that mean?

145
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:51,832
Let me tell you.

146
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,953
12 surprise collaborations
leading up to Christmas.

147
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:56,393
So over the next few
weeks when all the people

148
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:57,635
are like why are you
doing so many collabs?

149
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:58,518
It's 12 collabs of Christmas.

150
00:04:58,518 --> 00:05:00,352
12 collabs of Christmas.

151
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:01,581
I'm so excited for all the little

152
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:03,181
tricks I got up my sleeve.

153
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:04,014
I hope you enjoy.

154
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:05,931
Now go to the end card.
