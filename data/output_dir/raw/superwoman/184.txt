00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:32,280
♫ How can I sleep? How can I eat? How can I live when freedom isn't really free? ♫

159
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:38,020
♫ Cause I am a failure, not just me, but rather, we all fail if people don't know black lives matter ♫

160
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,659
♫ But money don't mean nothing if equal pay ain't the standard ♫.

161
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,939
♫ Trying to tweet these changes but one-forty letters can't change strangers. ♫

162
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,140
♫ It's not enough to be a diamond in the rough cause if you sit to pee, you at the bottom of the ladder. ♫

163
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,160
♫ We got clowns in elections, never pay them no attention, but the hate is progressing. ♫

164
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,940
♫ That's a reflection of who we are. Who are we? ♫

165
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,940
♫ We killing people for loving people. We don't know how to stop it. ♫

166
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,960
♫ We just making trending topics. ♫

167
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,240
♫ Why aren't we aiding aids? ♫

168
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
♫ When it comes to real problems, we need some hearing aids. ♫

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,280
♫ Some priorities, some respect. ♫

170
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,740
♫ Instead we reading about what two celebs just had sex. ♫

171
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,800
♫ Girls are getting raped. That ain't the fault of mini-skirts, it ain't because of alcohol, ♫

172
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,520
♫ or because she liked to flirt. ♫

173
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,200
♫ That's because we made a place where she has less of a worth, ♫

174
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,940
♫ and offenders walk away while the victims lay to hurt. ♫

175
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:26,060
♫ You scared of Muslims? I'm scared of your mentality. ♫

176
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,780
♫ Your weak mind is why we have so much damn brutality. ♫

177
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:31,320
♫ A war on terrorism, bigger war on ignorance. ♫

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,460
♫ Nice Muhammad Ali tattoo, I guess ignorance is bliss. ♫

179
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,200
♫ People are drowning in the water that we drink. ♫

180
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,480
♫ Trying to escape war, what more? ♫

181
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,380
♫ You got to think. You would rather let them sink then to let them in. ♫

182
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,320
♫ Borders, money, politics. ♫

183
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,840
♫ Eff the human condition. That's the world we live in. ♫

184
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,000
♫ Killing them, letting them die. Now, what's the difference? ♫

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,640
♫ We are killers. We are hateful. Are we blessed and ungrateful? ♫

186
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,360
♫ The solution and the problem. We can't just pray. ♫

187
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,620
♫ We gotta solve them. ♫

188
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,660
♫ Stop praying. Shut up. We solve them ♫

189
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,360
♫ We are the problem to our goddamn problems ♫

190
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,120
♫ How can you sleep?
How can you eat? ♫

191
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,940
♫ You're the problem to your goddamn problems ♫

192
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,900
♫ We are the problems to our goddamn problems ♫

193
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,600
♫ Shut up, and just solve them ♫

194
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,940
[Outro] We all have these voices in our heads,

195
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,540
but regardless of their presence,

196
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,080
it's up to us to decide which ones to use.

197
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,560
Which ones to base our actions on,

198
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:30,180
and which ones define us.

199
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,120
It's not about the voices in your head.

200
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,560
It's about what you do with them....
