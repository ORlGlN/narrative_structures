1
00:00:00,233 --> 00:00:04,244
(horse neighing and galloping)

2
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:05,510
Today's fitting was so great.

3
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:07,778
Yeah. Also, I can't wait
to take my Spanx off.

4
00:00:07,778 --> 00:00:09,876
Before I change could
you take a picture of me?

5
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,037
What should I be doing?

6
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:12,091
Can I get you a Starbucks cup?

7
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:13,327
Nah, that's too orchestrated.

8
00:00:13,327 --> 00:00:14,711
Planning to read a book?

9
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:17,370
I don't feel like I'd be reading
in this outfit, you know.

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,628
What if, like, I'm just
stepping out of my car?

11
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:22,762
Yeah, but we'd have to
move it into the sun.

12
00:00:22,762 --> 00:00:25,371
(light, playful music)

13
00:00:25,371 --> 00:00:28,807
The sun is this way, so
I would park that way.

14
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:29,640
That good?

15
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,473
A little more.

16
00:00:30,473 --> 00:00:31,306
Good?

17
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:32,439
A little more.

18
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,272
Good?

19
00:00:33,272 --> 00:00:34,105
A little more.

20
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,746
Too much!

21
00:00:35,746 --> 00:00:36,579
Stop!

22
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,872
Someone go move those garbage cans!

23
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:40,705
Is this good?

24
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:41,599
Take a few, okay?

25
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:44,402
(sighs)

26
00:00:44,402 --> 00:00:46,153
(picture snaps)

27
00:00:46,153 --> 00:00:47,339
Tell me when to switch, okay?

28
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,443
Hold on.

29
00:00:48,443 --> 00:00:49,276
(picture snap)

30
00:00:49,276 --> 00:00:50,109
I didn't say switch!

31
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,197
I know, but I was posing
for a really long time.

32
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:52,271
I felt awkward.

33
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:53,283
Stop moving!

34
00:00:53,283 --> 00:00:54,270
(picture snap)

35
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,308
... takes forever to focus

36
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:58,334
Wait, bend that right
leg. It looks kinda weird.

37
00:00:58,334 --> 00:00:59,250
(light, playful music)

38
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,083
It's not focusing!

39
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:00,916
Touch my face.

40
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:01,944
You're supposed to touch her face.

41
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:03,576
Yeah, I know how a phone
works, and it's not working

42
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,159
right now, hold on.

43
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:07,784
Why are you so close? Back up.

44
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:08,954
Are you telling me to move closer?

45
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:09,787
Back off.

46
00:01:09,787 --> 00:01:11,686
I feel like her face needs more light.

47
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,308
Now, well, it's either she's
well lit or the background's

48
00:01:13,308 --> 00:01:15,475
well lit. I can't do both.

49
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:18,909
Down. Down.

50
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:19,947
A little more.

51
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:20,806
A little less.

52
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:21,639
Stop there.

53
00:01:21,639 --> 00:01:22,472
(picture snap)

54
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:24,051
You look too much like you're posing.

55
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,028
Should I look away?

56
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:27,117
Look more natural, but
keep your back straight.

57
00:01:27,117 --> 00:01:30,840
Yeah, like, don't
slouch, but look relaxed.

58
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,381
How's this?

59
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,864
You're a little shiny.

60
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:37,046
Oh my god, thank you so much. I love you.

61
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:39,613
- [Makeup Artist] This is
important and you're doing great.

62
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:40,446
How's my hair?

63
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:41,660
Stop moving and talking!

64
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,493
Hold on.

65
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,452
Make sure you get full
body and close-up, okay?

66
00:01:50,452 --> 00:01:51,285
You can crop it.

67
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:52,118
It's not the same.

68
00:01:52,118 --> 00:01:53,055
I feel like you should show
a little more cleavage.

69
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:53,888
Really?

70
00:01:54,858 --> 00:01:55,799
Is that okay? (picture snap)

71
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,257
A little too much, might get flagged.

72
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:58,115
How about now? (picture snap)

73
00:01:58,115 --> 00:01:58,948
Yeah, that's good.

74
00:01:58,948 --> 00:02:00,175
You should take some
with your glasses off.

75
00:02:00,175 --> 00:02:03,333
(fast-paced music)

76
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,266
(picture snap)

77
00:02:05,266 --> 00:02:07,281
No, but now I can see
myself in the reflection.

78
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:08,186
Okay we can Photoshop it.

79
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:09,154
You can tag me.

80
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,561
Okay, I think we have a lot of options.

81
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,557
Lemme see.

82
00:02:11,557 --> 00:02:12,697
That one's nice.

83
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:14,292
Oh, that one's really good, right?

84
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,625
Did we get it?

85
00:02:16,694 --> 00:02:17,611
One more.

86
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,211
(picture snaps)

87
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,711
(bassy music)

88
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,640
You know, this first one's
pretty decent, actually.

89
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,776
Wait.

90
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,609
No, wait.

91
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:37,844
Yeah, okay, let me just
balance the colors.

92
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:39,094
Smooth my skin.

93
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,369
Okay.

94
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,982
Posted.

95
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:46,159
(light, upbeat music)

96
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,992
She's so effortless.

97
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:52,529
Yo, yo, wait, before you go
anywhere, make sure to give

98
00:02:52,529 --> 00:02:53,795
this video a big thumbs up.

99
00:02:53,795 --> 00:02:54,961
Check out my last video over there.

100
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,766
It's about when people
have a crush on you.

101
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,392

00:02:58,392 --> 00:02:59,826

One love Superwoman.

107
00:03:06,981 --> 00:00:00,000
That is a wrap, and ZOOP!
