1
00:00:00,507 --> 00:00:04,570
(unicorn hoof beats clattering)

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,661
(mellow music)

3
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:10,070
- Hi, welcome to Sefora, with
an F because of copyright.

4
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,936
(ding)

5
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:12,333
- Yeah I'm looking for some new lipstick.

6
00:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,400
- Great, what did you have in mind?

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,414
- I don't know.

8
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,719
I mean my personality kind of sucks

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,299
so I'm looking for something to fix that.

10
00:00:17,299 --> 00:00:18,820
- I have the perfect thing.

11
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,698
Try our new Talk Filter line.

12
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:21,781
- What the hell is a talk filter?

13
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:22,678
- Try one.

14
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:23,880
- Sexy Rouge.

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,576
Hm, sounds like a porno crayon.

16
00:00:25,576 --> 00:00:28,358
- Girl French makes
everything sound like porn.

17
00:00:28,358 --> 00:00:29,191
- Touche.

18
00:00:30,224 --> 00:00:32,280
I don't see what the big
deal about this lipstick is.

19
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,846
Like, it just makes me want
to climb on this table,

20
00:00:34,846 --> 00:00:37,424
wrap my legs around you
and bite your lower lip

21
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:38,674
until it hurts.

22
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,363
What the hell?

23
00:00:40,363 --> 00:00:41,908
- Sorry sister, you're
barking up the wrong tree.

24
00:00:41,908 --> 00:00:43,174
- I know, oh my god I'm so sorry.

25
00:00:43,174 --> 00:00:45,993
I just, I just feel like a coach you know,

26
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:46,845
and you're a gymnast.

27
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:50,280
I just want to come over there
and try to make you flip.

28
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,197
- Doubt it.

29
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,384
- Maybe you've just never experienced

30
00:00:53,384 --> 00:00:56,034
a woman who's done it right.

31
00:00:56,034 --> 00:00:59,648
- That's because I am the
woman who does it right, sis.

32
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,255
Makeup wipe?

33
00:01:01,255 --> 00:01:02,808
- Yeah.

34
00:01:02,808 --> 00:01:03,641
(laughs)

35
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,202
I am so sorry.

36
00:01:05,202 --> 00:01:06,759
I am usually not that forward.

37
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:07,824
- That makes one of us.

38
00:01:07,824 --> 00:01:08,657
(laughs)

39
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:09,490
- What is this one?

40
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:10,990
Nerdy Nights, ooh.

41
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,622
I really don't get how
this lipstick works.

42
00:01:13,622 --> 00:01:15,170
It's almost like the
pigment from the lipstick

43
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,365
is affecting my Broca's area,

44
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:17,660
which is formed by the pars triangular

45
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,687
and pars opercularis

46
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:20,102
of the interferior frontal gyrus

47
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:21,835
therefore affecting my
production of speech.

48
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,161
(gasps)

49
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,693
- I didn't know Sheldon
Cooper was a cute brown girl

50
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:25,901
with cute little boobs.

51
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,571
- Aw, these old mammary glands.

52
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:30,238
- Here try this one.

53
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,299
- You know darling, I've
been here for what seems like

54
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,975
an eternity and someone
has yet to offer me

55
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:39,375
an iced latte, or at the
very least a moist towelette

56
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,425
or a hydrating face mist.

57
00:01:41,425 --> 00:01:44,366
- From ladies free before
10 club, to country club,

58
00:01:44,366 --> 00:01:45,824
like that.
(snaps)

59
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:46,817
Bougie Pink

60
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,097
- Be a love and show me some products

61
00:01:48,097 --> 00:01:49,561
from the Michael Kors line.

62
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:51,591
- Michael Kors doesn't have a beauty line.

63
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:52,424
- Well I'll tell you this.

64
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:56,026
My life is becoming more and
more difficult by the moment.

65
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:56,906
- Do tell.

66
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:59,322
- First my barbaric driver bumps the curb

67
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:00,819
and nearly breaks my pearls.

68
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,478
I've been here for a lifetime
without an iced latte

69
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:04,774
and it's been 20 minutes

70
00:02:04,774 --> 00:02:07,542
since I've sniffed
anything lavender scented.

71
00:02:07,542 --> 00:02:09,127
- Girl I'm going to need one of those.

72
00:02:09,127 --> 00:02:12,100
- Isn't it sad that I feel
the need to wear makeup

73
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,083
or society won't accept me?

74
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,440
(melancholy music)

75
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,573
- Buzzkill Gray.

76
00:02:17,573 --> 00:02:20,364
- I'm a slave to the social constructs

77
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:22,140
that have been embedded into my psyche

78
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,899
and now I feel like if I
don't have a strong highlight

79
00:02:23,899 --> 00:02:25,891
on my cheek I am unworthy.

80
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:29,055
- Well, it's not completely wrong.

81
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:31,011
- Ooh, Liar Liar.

82
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:31,844
Sounds fun.

83
00:02:31,844 --> 00:02:32,677
Where is this one?

84
00:02:32,677 --> 00:02:34,020
- Sorry, we're all sold out.

85
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,767
We just sent a huge
shipment to the White House.

86
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:37,682
But try this one.

87
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:40,515
It's Nicki Minaj's new nude shade.

88
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,592
- This lipstick be so poppin',

89
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:45,878
feel like Barbie when I'm talkin'.

90
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:46,786
Boys want cookies and cream.

91
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,302
I'm like this ain't Baskin Robbins.

92
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,200
Ain't no floppin' when I'm droppin'.

93
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,333
Ain't no croppin' when I'm flauntin'.

94
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,477
The whole pic is so lit,
ain't no face to fix in it.

95
00:02:52,477 --> 00:02:54,890
Put moscato in my glass and
there ain't no mixing it.

96
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:55,933
Yeah my money is my crew.

97
00:02:55,933 --> 00:02:58,132
Yeah my money is my fetus,
all the rest are my sons

98
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:00,382
and you ain't gone beat us.

99
00:03:03,146 --> 00:03:06,587
- Girl, my wig just flew all
the way off to South Korea.

100
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,926
- That was exhausting.

101
00:03:07,926 --> 00:03:09,295
I need something more simple.

102
00:03:09,295 --> 00:03:10,128
Like this.

103
00:03:11,304 --> 00:03:12,721
I don't like to complicate things,

104
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:14,749
you know like makeup and relationships.

105
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:16,128
Honestly, sometimes I feel like I should

106
00:03:16,128 --> 00:03:18,371
just date my brother.

107
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,204
- What?

108
00:03:19,204 --> 00:03:20,609
- Yeah I mean that way
I wouldn't even have to

109
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,562
change my last name.

110
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:23,744
- Forbidden Romance.

111
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,139
Take that off.

112
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,773
Incest is nasty.

113
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,934
Unless you're Jon Snow and Daenerys,

114
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:29,684
and in that case yas.

115
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,070
- Wait what's this one?

116
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,052
Old Taylor Swift.

117
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:35,381
Okay I have to try this.

118
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,494
- Sorry girl, she's discontinued.

119
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:38,602
Yeah like her way.

120
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:41,935
- What happens if you mix the lipsticks.

121
00:03:44,815 --> 00:03:48,648
- Let's take this one
and let's take this one.

122
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:55,100
- I just want your phalanges
all over my epidermis.

123
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,765
I want to increase your
production of oxytocin.

124
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:00,598
- Let's try these two.

125
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,096
- This one is for the gentleman

126
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:09,999
with the rather booming
system, top lowered,

127
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,559
air conditioning with the cooling system.

128
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:13,718
When I arrive at the
venue he is blazing up.

129
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,808
Got investments on
deck, must be saving up.

130
00:04:16,808 --> 00:04:18,225
- This is so fun.

131
00:04:19,165 --> 00:04:20,082
One second.

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,072
(laughing)

133
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:26,422
You gonna buy something or not?

134
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:29,106
(booming)

135
00:04:29,106 --> 00:04:31,292
- [Lilly] What the hell is top filter?

136
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,125
- What do I say?

137
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,090
(laughing)
(beep)

138
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,664
- Do it one more time
where you're almost like,

139
00:04:34,664 --> 00:04:35,923
Michael Kors doesn't have one.

140
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:37,015
- Perfect, more (bleep).

141
00:04:37,015 --> 00:04:38,669
- Yeah exactly.
(laughing)

142
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:40,383
It's like the pigment is
affecting my Broca's area

143
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:43,386
which is formed of the pars
triangular pars operculis?

144
00:04:43,386 --> 00:04:44,219
(beep)

145
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,674
Which is formed of the pars
triangular and pars opercularis

146
00:04:45,674 --> 00:04:46,632

147
00:04:46,632 --> 00:04:48,239
Pars opercularis...

148
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,231
- [Kyle] Of the interfer--

149
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:51,049
- Of the interferior frontal...

150
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:51,882
- [Kyle] Gyrus.

151
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:52,823
- Which is formed by the pars triangular

152
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:55,585
and the pars opercularis
of the interior designing.

153
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:56,655
(beep)
It's almost as if the pigment

154
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:57,488
from the lipstick

155
00:04:57,488 --> 00:04:59,036
is affecting my Broca's
area which is formed by the

156
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:02,185
pars triangular and pars opercularis--

157
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,370
(screaming)
(beep)

158
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,311
Formed by the pars triangular
and pars opercularis

159
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:09,430
of the interferior gyrus
frontal lobe of my production.

160
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,448
(laughing)

161
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,281
Frig!

162
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:13,249
Is formed by the pars
triangular and pars opercularis

163
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:15,474
of the interferior frontal
gyrus therefore production my--

164
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,141
Oh I was so close.

165
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,558
Frig, F me, F me.

166
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:20,548
(laughing)

167
00:05:20,548 --> 00:05:21,829
(boom)

168
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,794

That is a wrap and zoop.

182
00:05:39,219 --> 00:00:00,000
Hi!
