00:03:21,064 --> 00:03:23,814
Three ways we can increase sales.

43
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:26,294
- [Man] Mimosa's?

44
00:03:26,294 --> 00:03:27,127
(phone ringing)

45
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,104

No, I won't let you down.

75
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,425
- I actually have this friend
who's a big casting director.

76
00:05:14,425 --> 00:05:16,705
I'll totally introduce you two,

77
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:18,622
if you eat this tomato.

78
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:28,295

89
00:06:28,737 --> 00:06:29,573
I know it's a little bit different

90
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:31,025
than my usual style of video,

91
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,211
but I wanted to challenge you all

92
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,080
to step out of your comfort zone.

93
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,436
Leave comfort for clothes, not the hustle.

94
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:37,871
