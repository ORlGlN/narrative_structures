1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,909
- Time flies.

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,669
(gently chiming bell)

3
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:05,647

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:08,249
What up 2018 it's a girl Superwoman,

5
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,820
and what better way of jumping

6
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,245
into the new year than looking

7
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:14,397
back and reflecting on 2017,
and just being grateful.

8
00:00:14,397 --> 00:00:17,502
We accomplished so much in 2017.

9
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:19,399
And hold up, hold up wait, I say we

10
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:21,798
because I understand
that no matter what I do,

11
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:24,648
it always involves you in some capacity.

12
00:00:24,648 --> 00:00:25,481
Let me explain.

13
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,314
If you know anything about me,

14
00:00:26,314 --> 00:00:27,327
you know I don't like the word luck.

15
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,557
Like anytime I achieve something
or work hard for something,

16
00:00:29,557 --> 00:00:30,390
people say, "You're so lucky."

17
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,780
I go, "No-no-no-no, ex-squeeze me."

18
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,548
I don't believe in lucky,
I work really, really hard

19
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:36,063
for the things that I have.

20
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:39,069
But having said that,
I kind of eat my words

21
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,652
because I am lucky because I
do know that there's people

22
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:43,904
out through the world that
work just as hard as me,

23
00:00:43,904 --> 00:00:45,555
are probably more talented than me,

24
00:00:45,555 --> 00:00:47,903
and don't have the support of you.

25
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:50,536
So in that sense, I am really
lucky to have your support,

26
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:53,482
your viewership, your
time, your energy, however,

27
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:56,254
and in whatever capacity, you support me.

28
00:00:56,254 --> 00:00:58,504
Whether it's a comment or thumbs
up or a passive reviewing,

29
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:02,168
I am lucky and grateful
to have you so thank you.

177
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:33,142
I am pumped for 2018 together.

178
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,872
Forever grateful for you and 2018,

179
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:38,137
I hope you're ready for Team Super,

180
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,809
'cause it's about to be lit.

181
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,323
Let's make 2018 full of love and art.

182
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:43,156
Kapeesh?

183
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:44,360
Go to the end, girl.

184
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,356
(explosion)

185
00:06:45,356 --> 00:06:46,613
(gently chiming bell)

186
00:06:46,613 --> 00:06:49,532
What's going on it's
2018, if you haven't yet

187
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:52,364
clicked that subscribe button
go ahead and do it, it's free.

188
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:54,780
If you hit the bell you'll be
notified when I upload maybe,

189
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,516
I'm not really sure
but go ahead and do it,

190
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:59,029
and until next time, one love Superwoman.

191
00:06:59,029 --> 00:00:00,000
That is a wrap and zoop!
