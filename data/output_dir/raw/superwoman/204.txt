00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,004
- It's been a hot minute!

2
00:00:02,004 --> 00:00:04,066
(horse neighs)

3
00:00:04,066 --> 00:00:05,647
(whooshing)

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:06,514
What up, everyone?

5
00:00:06,514 --> 00:00:07,347
It's your girl, Superwoman.

6
00:00:07,347 --> 00:00:09,447
I legit feel like it's been forever,

7
00:00:09,447 --> 00:00:12,561
forever ever, forever ever, forever ever

8
00:00:12,561 --> 00:00:13,826

00:00:15,697 --> 00:00:17,933

12
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,464
since the beginning of time.

13
00:00:21,464 --> 00:00:23,262
I'm talking about, you know

17
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:34,338
Since then, y'all been requesting this.

18
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:35,999
So, I hope you enjoy my parents reacting

19
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:38,049

20
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,284
Why am I on my tippy toes?

21
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:40,735
I could just adjust the tripod.

22
00:00:40,735 --> 00:00:41,629
That calf workout though.

23
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:43,049
The first time I saw this video,

24
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,550
I knew my parents would have a lot to say.

25
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,383
Check it out.

26
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:47,216
Hello.

27
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,982
I'm very short.

28
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:49,937
So long.

29
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:50,931
How you are?

30
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:51,920
Kids okay?

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,085
Sister?

32
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:53,970
Brother?

33
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,113
Mother?

34
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:56,155
Father?

35
00:00:56,155 --> 00:00:57,181
Neighbor?

36
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:58,338
Neighbor's brother?

37
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,171
Everybody good?

38
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:00,004
Good.

39
00:01:00,004 --> 00:01:00,945
It been so long, right?

40
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:02,659
A little bit nervous, like I don't.

41
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,113
I'm shy, little bit shy.

42
00:01:04,113 --> 00:01:04,946
Hello.

43
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:07,718

46
00:01:09,526 --> 00:01:10,359
Hiccup.

47
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,192
Backstreet Boy.

48
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:12,252

50
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:14,137
Good, good.

51
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:15,848
Not the second, not third, not fourth.

52
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:16,706
Fifth.

53
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:18,154
Fifth Harmony?

54
00:01:18,154 --> 00:01:19,536
Fifth, I never.

55
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:20,999
Number five in harmony.

56
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:22,893
I understand.

57
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:24,714
Destiny Child.

58
00:01:24,714 --> 00:01:26,501
They doing song Work From Home.

59
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:29,021
Work, work, oh the Rihanna.

60
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:30,275
No no, Iggy, Iggy.

61
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:31,877
Huh?

62
00:01:31,877 --> 00:01:33,294
Another song with work, huh?

63
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:35,639
It is a bloody musical, this exam season.

64
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:36,904
What the bloody hell happening?

65
00:01:36,904 --> 00:01:39,215
You know, for kid that don't do any work,

66
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:40,817
you have a lot of song called Work.

67
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:41,650
Work.

68
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,802
Work.

69
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,720
Work.

70
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,660
Work From Home.

71
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,854
I this song going to be
about doing housework.

72
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:48,433
Okay, I think it's going to
be very good song, I think,

73
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:52,715
with work from home, do
broom, do mop, do dishes, no?

74
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,805
You know, in my expert
opinion, I think Work From Home

75
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,886
going to be a beautiful story

76
00:01:57,886 --> 00:02:00,469
about calling in sick for work.

77
00:02:02,324 --> 00:02:04,685
You see, picking up garbage,
house work, you see?

78
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:08,852
("Work From Home" by Fifth Harmony)

79
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,355
Okay, hello.

80
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:16,071
Maybe garbage man.

81
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:17,934
This look like me, I think.

82
00:02:17,934 --> 00:02:19,571
I say, "Oh I'm in this video, look."

83
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:22,849
All your legs showing
with your pant too low.

84
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:25,231
She don't worry about nothing.

85
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,208
Nada.

86
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:28,274
What, what, Lilly.

87
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:29,524
Lilly, oh okay.

88
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:32,987
That's very big arm he have,

89
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,678
like a Hulkamania Hulk over here.

90
00:02:35,678 --> 00:02:38,355
They do housework outside, gardening.

91
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:40,178
Okay, look, Rihanna.

92
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:41,119
I told you Rihanna.

93
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,594
You said Rihanna no sing this song.

94
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,614
Multiculturalism, yay.

95
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:46,031
Go RiRi, go RiRi.

96
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,767
Yum, Liam Hemsworth.

97
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:53,008
No explanation.

98
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,450
Okay, I don't like this one.

99
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,073
Why you doing like this?

100
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:56,955
Oh.

101
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,288
Very big muscle.

102
00:02:59,277 --> 00:03:00,554
Okay, I like this one.

103
00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:02,191
They do housework.

104
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:05,581
School, work, study, work, garden, work.

105
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:08,564
This how you brick house, like this.

106
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:10,145
All of a sudden, oh house.

107
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:12,478
Don't do like Miley, please.

108
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,441
I think they're recording
me for this video.

109
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:19,717
This look same, body
double, same same, I think.

110
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:21,440
What's happening here?

111
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,019
You building home or you building baby?

112
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:23,934
Stop.

113
00:03:23,934 --> 00:03:25,036
Oh, you know what?

114
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,607
Other day, I was gardening outside.

115
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,070
They probably did secret
camera, GoProing on me.

116
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:32,691
This, I look same, just
like, I'm this handsome.

117
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,914
Look, I don't like she
doing all this thing.

118
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,974
♫ He's on the night shift ♫♫

119
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,281
Night shift.

120
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:41,972
He probably working
security guard somewhere.

121
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,889
Oh, he's very handsome.

122
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,087
Workers look like this these days.

123
00:03:52,087 --> 00:03:54,796
I think our house needs
some renovation, Manjeet.

124
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:55,991
They in construction zone.

125
00:03:55,991 --> 00:03:57,803
They not wearing hard hat.

126
00:03:57,803 --> 00:03:59,138
Okay, first of all,
they going to get hurt.

127
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,217
You need hard surface who protect you.

128
00:04:01,217 --> 00:04:02,517
Where your hard surface?

129
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:03,886
Tell me where your hard surface is, huh?

130
00:04:03,886 --> 00:04:04,897
Where hard surface?

131
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:05,906
I don't see.

132
00:04:05,906 --> 00:04:07,655
Oh okay, there it is.

133
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:09,866
I think we should do renovation.

134
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:13,283
New wall, floor work, this kind of thing.

135
00:04:15,504 --> 00:04:19,192
I don't think your body can
build house, I'm just saying.

136
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:20,797
This is science.

137
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:25,215
His body so oily, I could
make french fry on his chest.

138
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,457
They okay.

139
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:28,767
I mean, I'm in shirt right now.

140
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:31,267
I take off shirt, I look same.

141
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:33,858
Who the bloody hell this is?

142
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:38,025
Ty Dollars, you make a typo
in your name, my friend.

143
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:40,381
Where he came from?

144
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,714
I like this one.

145
00:04:42,929 --> 00:04:45,659
What is happening here?

146
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,076
Where your pants?

147
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:49,633
Okay, they see.

148
00:04:49,633 --> 00:04:51,325
They shoot wrong angle.

149
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,034
They think camera this
way, looking back this way.

150
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,271
They say, "No, you are taking my behind.

151
00:04:54,271 --> 00:04:55,196
"Go to front.

152
00:04:55,196 --> 00:04:58,741
"How do you supposed to see
my eyes from this angle?"

153
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:59,897
Clap, no hand?

154
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:02,980
How do you supposed to clap, no hand?

155
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:06,604
You can't, stupid.

156
00:05:06,604 --> 00:05:08,980
You know, they showing guys, photoshop.

157
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,923
This all photoshop, you know.

158
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:11,954
This man very hidden.

159
00:05:11,954 --> 00:05:12,787
Are you girl?

160
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:13,714
Are you woman?

161
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,547
Are you man?

162
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:15,380
What one?

163
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,831
Which one should we use?

164
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,477
I don't know what the
bloody hell he saying.

165
00:05:19,477 --> 00:05:21,883
He's just gah gah gah gah gah.

166
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:23,844
Why does this strong man come in?

167
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,784
They're doing hammering and screwdriving.

168
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:26,617
I like.

169
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,450
We need renovation.

170
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,306
House so old.

171
00:05:28,306 --> 00:05:29,862
Look, they have renovation.

172
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,310
Manjeet, call construction right now.

173
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,827
I think you have to go to work.

174
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:36,797
Who gonna pay the bills, huh?

175
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:37,630
You showing muscle.

176
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,065
Muscle don't pay bill, you know.

177
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:42,025
If they did, then I would be millionaire

178
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:44,626
because I have physique.

179
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:45,543
I have gun.

180
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,153
I want to work from home also.

181
00:05:50,153 --> 00:05:51,639
No photoshop here.

182
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:53,139
Same, we are same.

183
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,647
This photoshop.

184
00:05:58,015 --> 00:06:00,417
I never likes a man so much in my life.

185
00:06:00,417 --> 00:06:02,844
You know, I think this
best video I have ever

186
00:06:02,844 --> 00:06:06,286
react to personally, I think,
in my personal opinion.

187
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,462
Good storyline, good message,

188
00:06:08,462 --> 00:06:11,819
good visual effect, everything, you know.

189
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,284
This is like Interstellar.

190
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:14,418
This like Gravity.

191
00:06:14,418 --> 00:06:15,418
This Avatar.

192
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:20,928
Whatever.

193
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,966
I don't think this is
how you build house, so.

194
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,549
You know, who's really winning?

195
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:31,124
Paramjeet, come hug me.

196
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,596
The word work in music is like

197
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,596
the puppy filter on Snapchat.

198
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,440
Everybody using that ish.

199
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,611
Hope you enjoyed that video.

200
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,088
If you did, you know what to do.

201
00:06:40,088 --> 00:06:41,701
If you don't know what to
do, imma tell you right now.

202
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:43,971
Hit that thumbs up,
because that matters to me.

203
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,804
I check it.

204
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:48,689
It doesn't do anything, like
I don't win an award, but it

205
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:53,410
makes me feel good inside
so if you like it (mumbles).

206
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,802
Comment below letting me
know what else would you like

207
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:57,142
my parents to react to, because I'm always

208
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:57,975
looking for your suggestions.

209
00:06:57,975 --> 00:06:59,824
After all, you're the
one watching my videos,

210
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:00,914
and so I want you to enjoy them.

211
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:02,655
You can check out my last
video over right over there.

212
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,655
It is called

213
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,599
Types of Neighbors.

214
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:07,927
Obviously, I know my stuff.

215
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,657
My second vlog channel
is right over there.

216
00:07:09,657 --> 00:07:11,245
If you don't know,
aside from this channel,

217
00:07:11,245 --> 00:07:13,264
I have a second channel
where I do daily vlogs.

218
00:07:13,264 --> 00:07:14,836
It's right over there, so
if you're interested in

219
00:07:14,836 --> 00:07:17,645
when I'm not doing this
Monday and Thursday stuff,

220
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,716
go check it out.

221
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:19,937
Other than that, make sure you subscribe,

222
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:22,020
because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday,

223
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,507
and it really means a lot
to me that you're here.

224
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:27,026
I like having you here and I
hope you're having a great day,

225
00:07:27,026 --> 00:07:30,929
and I sincerely hope that you
are happy and in a good place.

226
00:07:30,929 --> 00:07:32,612
I really, really do.

227
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:34,306
One love, Superwoman.

228
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:36,105
That is a wrap, and zoop.

229
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:37,638
My box cut.

230
00:07:37,638 --> 00:07:39,356
If you don't know what
I'm talking about, vlogs.

231
00:07:39,356 --> 00:00:00,000
I have a sports injury.
