1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:02,662
(neighing)

2
00:00:05,663 --> 00:00:06,496
- What up, everyone?

3
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:10,181
It's your girl Superwoman,
and it's story time with Lily!

4
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:12,293
I thought I would tell
you my childhood stories

5
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:15,075
through acting them out.

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:15,908
Wait, you know what?

7
00:00:15,908 --> 00:00:17,349
This video's pretty long.

8
00:00:17,349 --> 00:00:19,182
To be continued, boom!

9
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:22,732
One of the reasons I'm so big on feminism

10
00:00:22,732 --> 00:00:24,659
and empowering women,
especially young girls,

11
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,811
is because growing up, I had
to hear things like this.

12
00:00:27,811 --> 00:00:29,448
- Girls shouldn't whistle.

13
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:31,675
Girls shouldn't dance at weddings.

14
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:33,807
Girls shouldn't talk too much.

15
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:36,362
- So now, I've made it a point
to do all of those things.

16
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:37,195
Why?

17
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:38,562
Because when something is unjust,

18
00:00:38,562 --> 00:00:40,528
you don't just repeat the cycle of wrong.

19
00:00:40,528 --> 00:00:41,817
No, you make it right.

20
00:00:41,817 --> 00:00:42,669
So, ahem.

21
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:45,002
(whistling)

22
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:48,763
I've had a lot of really
good days in my life.

23
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,422
You know, meeting The
Rock, meeting Selena Gomez,

24
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:51,773
traveling to some dope countries.

25
00:00:51,773 --> 00:00:55,154
But still, one of the best
days of my life remains.

26
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,654
You got me an N64?

27
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:00,098
(screaming)

28
00:01:13,576 --> 00:01:14,699
(burping)

29
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:17,828
N64 is the best system of all time,

30
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,908
closely followed by Super Nintendo.

31
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:22,417
Do not at me on this, do
not debate me on this.

32
00:01:22,417 --> 00:01:27,057
I will 007, Mario Party,
Banjo Kazooie your blood clot!

33
00:01:27,057 --> 00:01:28,784
On that note, a lot of times,

34
00:01:28,784 --> 00:01:29,963
when people hear the way I talk

35
00:01:29,963 --> 00:01:30,878
or see the way I dress,

36
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:33,304
they assume I'm trying to
act like somebody else,

37
00:01:33,304 --> 00:01:34,521
and that couldn't be more wrong.

38
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:35,773
When I talk the way I talk

39
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,027
and dress the way I dress,

40
00:01:37,027 --> 00:01:38,646
I am being completely myself,

41
00:01:38,646 --> 00:01:40,275
and that is because I was born and raised

42
00:01:40,275 --> 00:01:42,135
in a place called Scarborough.

43
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,825
My school was filled with black people

44
00:01:43,825 --> 00:01:45,373
and South Asian people, which means that

45
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:47,723
everyone knew how to speak Tamil,

46
00:01:47,723 --> 00:01:50,188
everyone knew how to
speak Jamaican Patois.

47
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,058
It was expected of everyone,
and that's what we knew.

48
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,960
Our school dances only played reggae,

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,969
dance hall, soka, rap, and hip hop.

50
00:01:56,969 --> 00:01:58,011
So if I didn't act the way I act

51
00:01:58,011 --> 00:01:58,901
and talk the way I talk,

52
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,082
then I'd be acting like someone else.

53
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:01,915
Ya dig?

54
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:03,048
You don' know my youth.

55
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:04,747
Snitches get stitches, ya hear me now?

56
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,559
Speaking of stitches, I've had a few.

57
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,011
In fact, once my head
cracked open on my birthday.

58
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:12,928
It's my birthday, and I
get some birthday cake!

59
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:18,680
(screaming)

60
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:24,553
♫ Happy birthday to Lily

61
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:27,970
♫ Happy birthday to you!

62
00:02:29,086 --> 00:02:31,152
True story, I was running
up the stairs on my birthday

63
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:32,874
and I think I got distracted
by cake or something

64
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,689
and I fell and cracked my head open.

65
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,002
My mom fainted in the hospital

66
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,711
because they were stitching up my eyelid.

67
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:38,959
You see that, you see that right there?

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,740
That's why my eyebrows
can never be on fleek.

69
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,034
That, and because I never get them done.

70
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:43,547
I've also gotten stitches on my hand.

71
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:44,963
Basically, there was this computer game

72
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:46,869
named Jill of the Jungle, where this girl,

73
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:48,745
she would swing on vines in the jungle.

74
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:50,296
So during recess one day, I was like, yo,

75
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,311
we're playing hide and seek,

76
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:53,049
I'm gonna hide in this washroom stall,

77
00:02:53,049 --> 00:02:54,523
but I don't want them to see my feet,

78
00:02:54,523 --> 00:02:56,380
so I'm gonna swing on the coat hook,

79
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,023
just like Jill of the Jungle.

80
00:02:58,023 --> 00:02:59,088
Yay!

81
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:00,706
It went through my hand.

82
00:03:00,706 --> 00:03:01,706
Ow, help me!

83
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:04,285
Mrs. Parks!

84
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,102
(screaming)

85
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,620
Yeah, I was just hanging there

86
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,729
with my hand through the coat hook.

87
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,393
Boom, the receipts!

88
00:03:11,393 --> 00:03:13,035
Yeah, I got injured a lot as a kid,

89
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,742
but one of the most memorable times

90
00:03:14,742 --> 00:03:15,839
was when I got a new bike,

91
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,967
and I wouldn't admit that
it was too big for me.

92
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:19,806
So I was riding the bike and I fell

93
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:22,687
into the bar crotch first, and I was like,

94
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:24,409
mm, that really hurt.

95
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:27,159
So I went into the washroom, and:

96
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:35,903
Mom!

97
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,045
Now, I know what you're thinking, and no,

98
00:03:37,045 --> 00:03:39,830
it wasn't my period, but there
was still blood everywhere.

99
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,946
And at that age, I didn't get

100
00:03:40,946 --> 00:03:42,120
why my mom was so concerned,

101
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,495
and she was outside the
washroom door just like,

102
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:45,327
"Please, God, make sure she
didn't bruck up her uterus.

103
00:03:45,327 --> 00:03:47,272
"You know I only had kids
so I could have grandkids."

104
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:49,292
It turned out I just
got a cut in the area.

105
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,430
That's right, you see, normally girls

106
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,343
only have to experience that
pulling down the underwear

107
00:03:52,343 --> 00:03:53,848
and seeing blood once in their life.

108
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:55,655
But me, nope, twice.

109
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:56,879
I had a pet cat named Oreo,

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,630
and he was my best friend!

111
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,593
And then he ran away.

112
00:03:59,593 --> 00:04:03,760
Your my bestest friend in
the whole, entire world.

113
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:11,020
No, no!

114
00:04:12,665 --> 00:04:14,665
(crying)

115
00:04:14,665 --> 00:04:16,991
I was so devastated about it,

116
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:19,081
but his favorite food was Lucky Charms,

117
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,748
so obviously, I knew what to do.

118
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:37,743
Now we wait.

119
00:04:40,251 --> 00:04:42,062
Spoiler alert, I never found him.

120
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,145
It was fine though.

121
00:04:43,145 --> 00:04:44,465
It was actually extremely painful

122
00:04:44,465 --> 00:04:46,289
and traumatizing, to be honest.

123
00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:47,957
In school, I was an overachiever,

124
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:49,696
and to be honest, the teacher's pet.

125
00:04:49,696 --> 00:04:51,855
I was even valedictorian in grade eight,

126
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,254
and also very naive.

127
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:57,276
And I just know we'll be friends forever,

128
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:59,674
because that's how real life works.

129
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,924
(applause)

130
00:05:04,082 --> 00:05:05,702
A moment of silence for all the friends

131
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:07,870
we thought we'd have forever.

132
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,982
In grade 11, my family
moved from Scarborough

133
00:05:09,982 --> 00:05:11,097
and to another town,

134
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:13,545
but I still kept going
to the same high school,

135
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:15,188
but had nowhere to go after school,

136
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:16,021
because I couldn't go home.

137
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,926
So, I used to go to my
best friends' house,

138
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:20,174
and they were two Tamil twins.

139
00:05:20,174 --> 00:05:22,821
So, basically, I was part
raised by a Tamil family,

140
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,466
which is why I'm so
proficient in the language,

141
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:27,363
and I can pelvic thrust
like my life depends on it.

142
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:29,863
(Tamil music)

143
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:34,345
- [Woman] Oi, Lily, come down and eat!

144
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:35,304
- Mummy!

145
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,200
(speaking in Tamil)

146
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,188
Being an overachiever
wasn't just in school.

147
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:43,304
No, in life in general, it
used to really bother me,

148
00:05:43,304 --> 00:05:45,463
and continues to really bother me

149
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:47,839
if I don't do a really
good job at something.

150
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:49,712
Back to that obsessive behavior.

151
00:05:49,712 --> 00:05:51,387
So, even my first job at Harvey's,

152
00:05:51,387 --> 00:05:52,633
which is a fast food restaurant,

153
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,574
even though it was a
crappy job, I was like,

154
00:05:54,574 --> 00:05:57,574
no, I will be the best employee ever.

155
00:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,991
(heavy electronic music)

156
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:09,008
Your burger and fries, ma'am.

157
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,638
- [Customer] Took you long enough, loser.

158
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,221
- Have a great day!

159
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:15,064
As I grew up, I had a bunch of jobs,

160
00:06:15,064 --> 00:06:16,703
and they were all kind of crappy.

161
00:06:16,703 --> 00:06:20,050
The worst, though, was when I
worked at a collection agency.

162
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,133
Lord help me!

163
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,531
Hello, I'm calling about
your outstanding payment.

164
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:26,364
- [Man] Shut the (censored) up!

165
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:30,980
You (censored) suck my
(censored), you (censored).

166
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,813
- Okay.

167
00:06:32,695 --> 00:06:34,901
Hi, hi, yes, I'm following up on

168
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:38,224
that outstanding hydro bill, remember me?

169
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:41,974
- [Man On Phone] I'm a
little busy right now.

170
00:06:42,901 --> 00:06:45,763
- Oh, oh my, did you
want me to call you back?

171
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:47,348
I could call you back in like two minute?

172
00:06:47,348 --> 00:06:48,598
Or, like, five?

173
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:51,745
I don't mean to be offensive.

174
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,639
How long do you think you need?

175
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,079
I don't wanna assume.

176
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,965
Not to mention the boss
was 100% verbally abusive.

177
00:06:57,965 --> 00:07:00,060
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?

178
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,172
Are you stupid, are you crazy?

179
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:03,130
You're wasting my money.

180
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,380
Are you mental?

181
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:08,665
- Aka, the type of boss that
I will never be in my life.

182
00:07:08,665 --> 00:07:11,225
Yo, shut up, I'm trying to
make a video, you stupid!

183
00:07:11,225 --> 00:07:12,390
I'm just kidding, there's no one here.

184
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,919
I'm all alone!

185
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,771
(laughing)

186
00:07:14,771 --> 00:07:16,671
And that's my childhood in a nutshell.

187
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,366
Of course, except for all
the other dramatic and

188
00:07:18,366 --> 00:07:20,060
really heartbreaking stuff that happened.

189
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,431
But this is a comedy channel.

190
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,202
I'll save that for my
episode with Dr. Phil.

191
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,419
Hey, hey, now that you know me,

192
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,004
the ins and outs of Lily Singh,

193
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:27,407
the person behind Superwoman,

194
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,303
go ahead and click subscribe, because, yo,

195
00:07:29,303 --> 00:07:32,533
I'm clearly a well-developed,
awesome, kind-hearted,

196
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:35,797
talented, sexy person
that you should support,

197
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:38,249
so not only click the button, hit the bell

198
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,839
that sometimes will notify you.

199
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,251
Probably not, to be honest, but it might.

200
00:07:42,251 --> 00:07:46,099
Okay, go on to the end
card, get out of here!

201
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,445
Yo, sorry to cut this video in two,

202
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,164
but I did it, and it was
like 100 minutes long,

203
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:50,107
and I was like, my bad!

204
00:07:50,107 --> 00:07:51,602
Wanna see more videos like
this, right over there.

205
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:54,022
Second vlog channel that
is lit, right over there.

206
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:54,987
And make sure you subscribe,

207
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:57,262
'cause I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday.

208
00:07:57,262 --> 00:00:00,000
One love, Superwoman,
that is a wrap, and zoom!
