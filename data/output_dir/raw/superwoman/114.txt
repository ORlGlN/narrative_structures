5
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:33,754
- Well, I was hoping we
could discuss tour dates.

00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:35,199
- What about 'em?

7
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,495
- When are we planning to release them?

8
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,753

00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:44,287
When am I going to be able to tell them?

00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:46,026

(popcorn popping)
