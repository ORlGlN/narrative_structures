00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,594
♫ Passionate from miles away

12
00:00:54,594 --> 00:00:57,627
♫ Passive with the things you say

13
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,054
♫ Passin' up on my old ways

14
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:03,896

deserve better than him.

17
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:18,269
Do not let him treat you
like that! (clicking tongue)

18
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:19,703
(scoffing) La la la, I'm not listening!

00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,835
Can I just get a medium fries please?

♫ Can't stop won't stop moving

36
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:42,564
♫ It's like I got this music in my mind

37
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:45,493
♫ Saying it's gonna be all right

00:02:45,493 --> 00:02:47,966
♫ 'Cause the players gonna
play play play play play

39
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:50,850
♫ And the haters gonna
