1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:02,365
- You know, to be honest,
I'm not really sure

2
00:00:02,365 --> 00:00:05,014
if y'all wanted this calab to happen.

3
00:00:05,014 --> 00:00:07,976
(bells jingling)

4
00:00:07,976 --> 00:00:10,597
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman.

5
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,798
Now when you're under age
there seems to be this

6
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,185
magic around the idea of clubbing,

7
00:00:15,185 --> 00:00:18,522
and to someone who's older
and been there and done that,

8
00:00:18,522 --> 00:00:21,183
let me tell you what
clubbing is really like.

9
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:23,456
Your night's gonna start off
getting ready with your friends

10
00:00:23,456 --> 00:00:26,433
aka, destroying some persons wash room,

11
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:30,273
and you see this, is
where the party starts.

12
00:00:30,273 --> 00:00:32,328
♫ I know you like to party

13
00:00:32,328 --> 00:00:34,211
♫ I know you like to party

14
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:36,203
♫ I know you like to party

15
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:39,503
♫ I know you like to party

16
00:00:39,503 --> 00:00:40,902
- This stuff is good.

17
00:00:40,902 --> 00:00:41,822
- What is it?

18
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:42,655
- Boss.

19
00:00:42,655 --> 00:00:44,277
- Oh true.

20
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:45,950
♫ I know you like to party

21
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,921
♫ I know you like to party

22
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:51,100
♫ I know you like to party

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,745
- Drinks are $15 in this club,

24
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,380
which means you need to be
tipsy before you even get there.

25
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,049
Let me break this math
down for you real quick.

26
00:00:58,049 --> 00:00:59,498
Ladies are free before 11.

27
00:00:59,498 --> 00:01:01,221
So you need to leave at 10:15.

28
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:03,672
This means you need to
start drinking at 9:15

29
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:06,594
to give yourself approximately
60 minutes to get tipsy.

30
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:09,224
Which equals about one
drink ever 15 minutes.

31
00:01:09,224 --> 00:01:11,310
Equaling one sip every three minutes

32
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,299
or one chug every five minutes,

33
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:16,674
and if you fall behind,
that's disrespectful.

34
00:01:16,674 --> 00:01:19,674
(upbeat bass music)

35
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,477
- Girl, you need to catch up.

36
00:01:24,477 --> 00:01:26,542
Come on now, what are you doing?

37
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:28,982
- You're right, you're right.

38
00:01:28,982 --> 00:01:32,310
(upbeat bass music)

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,619
- Get it girl.

40
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,748
You make yourself a
roadie, jump in an Uber.

41
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:37,861
In which case your driver
will pretend to be stupid

42
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:39,703
and act like he doesn't
know that your water

43
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:41,266
is actually vodka.

44
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:43,849
(upbeat music)

45
00:01:48,124 --> 00:01:49,417
- Uber for Luie?

46
00:01:49,417 --> 00:01:50,250
Perfect.

47
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,527
- In fact, to insure that
he believes you're innocent,

48
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:55,830
you'll probably go out of your way

49
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,396
and say some dumb ish like.

50
00:01:57,396 --> 00:02:00,180
Thank god we brought
this water, I am parched.

51
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,347
- Yeah, gotta make sure to
stay hydrated, with water.

52
00:02:06,207 --> 00:02:07,040
H2O.

53
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:08,898
- So good.

54
00:02:09,887 --> 00:02:11,467
So you roll up to the club and one of

55
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:13,056
three things is about to happen.

56
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:16,301
Number one, it's 10:55
but this bouncer's gonna

57
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:19,006
claim that you're late
and now you need to pay.

58
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,369
- That's $10 each.

59
00:02:20,369 --> 00:02:23,084
- Hold up, $10, whatchu talking about?

60
00:02:23,084 --> 00:02:24,418
It's 10:55.

61
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:26,337
Ladies free before 11, brah.

62
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,129
- Yeah, we have vaginas brah.

63
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,652
- That's right, and boobs.

64
00:02:29,652 --> 00:02:30,755
- Yeah, kind of.

65
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:31,993
- On no girl, you good.

66
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:33,314
- That's that girl love.

67
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:34,476
- It's past 11.

68
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:36,931
- Okay whoa, whoa, we
still have five minutes.

69
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:38,747
What time zone are you living in?

70
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,460
- Yeah, Pacific Standard Time?

71
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,123
You on the islands, brah?

72
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:43,525
- $10 or leave.

73
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:44,432
- This guy.

74
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:45,379
- Catch my clutch.

75
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,212
- Okay.

76
00:02:46,212 --> 00:02:47,745
- You, what's your name, huh?

77
00:02:47,745 --> 00:02:49,328
I'm gonna complain.

78
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:52,253
- Of course, of course.

79
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,109
- Weird name.

80
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:54,713
- You need to learn how to check the time.

81
00:02:54,713 --> 00:02:55,986
You know what, in fact.

82
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:59,395
Let me fill you out a
subscription real quick.

83
00:02:59,395 --> 00:03:00,851
That's the line right there.

84
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,656
What is your name, I'm gonna complain.

85
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,520
Acting like you're gonna
remember any of this tomorrow

86
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,631
when you're hung over.

87
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:06,464
Girl please.

88
00:03:06,464 --> 00:03:09,266
Going through your notes like, power trip.

89
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:11,042
When did I agree to go to power?

90
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:14,765
Number two, there's going to 100% for sure

91
00:03:14,765 --> 00:03:17,575
be some sort of confusion with the list.

92
00:03:17,575 --> 00:03:18,944
- Are you on the guest list?

93
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,307
- Yes, that's why we're
in the guest list line.

94
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:22,140
This guy.

95
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,973
- Name?

96
00:03:22,973 --> 00:03:24,109
- Lilly, Elisa.

97
00:03:24,109 --> 00:03:25,222
- Elisa and Lilly.

98
00:03:25,222 --> 00:03:26,389
- Are you two twins?

99
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:27,972
- Okay, whoa, whoa.

100
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:30,885
Just because we both
have the same skin color,

101
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:32,592
it doesn't mean we're the same.

102
00:03:32,592 --> 00:03:34,637
- Yeah, we're own own people, okay.

103
00:03:34,637 --> 00:03:36,137
Stop comparing us.

104
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,396
- You're not on the list.

105
00:03:44,396 --> 00:03:45,852
- What you mean we're not on the list?

106
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:46,919
Check the list again, bruh.

107
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,252
- Yeah check the list, bruh.

108
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:54,611
- Wait hold on, which list you checking?

109
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,140
- Bottle service list.

110
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,383
- Well it depends, how much is it?

111
00:03:57,383 --> 00:03:58,237
- $400 a bottle.

112
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,094
- Are you dumb?

113
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,392
- Can we get cans?

114
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,774
- Or a large jug?

115
00:04:02,774 --> 00:04:04,333
- Can you guys hurry up?

116
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:08,333
- Who the, hey don't make
me put you on my list!

117
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:12,335
- And number three.

118
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:16,002
You finally cave and
agree to pay $10, when.

119
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,196
- Yo I don't have cash.

120
00:04:22,196 --> 00:04:23,170
- Of for real?

121
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,903
- Yeah can you cover me?

122
00:04:24,903 --> 00:04:25,885
- Yeah, okay.

123
00:04:25,885 --> 00:04:27,125
I mean there's an ATM right there.

124
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:28,833
- Girl you the best, I'll see you inside.

125
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,750
- Oh, okay.

126
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:31,621
God damn.

127
00:04:36,127 --> 00:04:37,463
- And here's the thing, right.

128
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:39,113
When you arrive by the free time,

129
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:41,178
it's still so early and the club is empty.

130
00:04:41,178 --> 00:04:42,778
They're still setting up the place.

131
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:45,513
The effin DJ is plugging in
wires and testing the mic.

132
00:04:45,513 --> 00:04:47,287
- Microphone check one, two.

133
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,630
Okay (laughing)

134
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,081
- All right, sorry, excuse me.

135
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,115
Oh you're here.

136
00:04:52,115 --> 00:04:53,090
- oh no.

137
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,630
- Yeah just take it right over there.

138
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,353
- You can't miss it, it's right there.

139
00:04:56,353 --> 00:04:57,436
- Okay, okay.

140
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:00,179
- Okay this way?

141
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:01,262
- Over there.

142
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:05,215
- And now this entire
situation has killed your buzz,

143
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:06,899
and you need to get tipsy again.

144
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:08,708
So you're like, okay
for the next 30 minutes

145
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,196
let me just go hard.

146
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:13,848
Take one, two, okay three rounds of shots,

147
00:05:13,848 --> 00:05:16,762
and then right after,
you will 100% of the time

148
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:18,679
have this conversation.

149
00:05:21,083 --> 00:05:24,082
Holy crap, I think I'm immune to alcohol.

150
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:26,166
- I know, it's not hitting me at all.

151
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,607
- You know what it is?

152
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:29,776
It's probably like we're
mature, and grown out of it.

153
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:32,109
- You right, cheers to that.

154
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:39,402
(upbeat techno music)

155
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,481
- I love you man.

156
00:05:44,481 --> 00:05:45,893
Listen, listen, listen.

157
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:48,905
I'm so happy for your success.

158
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:50,299
- Thank you.

159
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:52,376
I'm gonna text my ex now.

160
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:53,626
- Oh good idea.

161
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,719
- DJs in clubs are ridiculous.

162
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,274
I mean half the time they play music,

163
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,406
but the other half they
ruin your favorite song

164
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:03,139
by yelling into the microphone.

165
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,379
When it starts it's okay,

166
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:05,466
because it's like.

167
00:06:05,466 --> 00:06:06,974
- Hey make some noise!

168
00:06:06,974 --> 00:06:09,254
(cheering)

169
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:10,791
Holla for the weekend!

170
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:12,890
(cheering)

171
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,143
- But then, ish gets awkward.

172
00:06:15,143 --> 00:06:19,239
- If you getting drunk and
making bad decisions, say ay!

173
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,072
- Oh yeah!

174
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:25,486
- If you out here trying to
cheat on your man, say ay!

175
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,806
- What?

176
00:06:26,806 --> 00:06:28,907
- If you so crazy that you sleeping with

177
00:06:28,907 --> 00:06:31,542
your best friends man, say ay!

178
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,375
- Ayyyyy!

179
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,243
I mean, I'm just kidding.

180
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,476
- And then of course this.

181
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:47,335
- You got a $10 bill get your hands up.

182
00:06:47,335 --> 00:06:49,181
- I thought you didn't have $10.

183
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,014
- What?

184
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:51,707
- Outside I paid for your $10 cover

185
00:06:51,707 --> 00:06:53,045
and now your hands are up,

186
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,417
so I just want some clarification.

187
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:57,379
- Oh now, it's just the song.

188
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,845
- Put your hands down, girl.

189
00:06:58,845 --> 00:06:59,678
- What?

190
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:01,066
- Put your hands down.

191
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,074
- Don't be silly.

192
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,004
- No I said put your hands down!

193
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:05,674
Don't be up in the club with your hands up

194
00:07:05,674 --> 00:07:08,093
pretending you got a $100
bill when you got food stamps

195
00:07:08,093 --> 00:07:10,168
falling out of your pocket, okay.

196
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,272
Not to mention that clubs are so crowded

197
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:13,891
they get all gross and sweaty.

198
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,827
Yeah trying to get from one
side of the club to the other

199
00:07:15,827 --> 00:07:17,418
is next to impossible.

200
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:18,860
So you gotta migrate with your crew

201
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,754
and do that thing where
you're holding hands.

202
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,289
Yeah you look like that Christmas wreath

203
00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:23,692
you made in elementary school

204
00:07:23,692 --> 00:07:25,203
for diversity and ish.

205
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:27,230
Looks a little something like this.

206
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,397
(upbeat techno music)

207
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:33,793
- Elisa, Elisa!

208
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,247
- Lilly, don't let go!

209
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,717
- I won't let go!

210
00:07:36,717 --> 00:07:40,884
(My Heart Will Go On instrumental)

211
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:49,890
- All this romance is turning me on.

212
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,566
- Slut Titanic,

213
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,806
and I'm an iceberg, you
know, I'm just take her down.

214
00:07:54,806 --> 00:07:56,971
- You're going to kill her?

215
00:07:56,971 --> 00:07:58,725
- No no man, I'm gonna hook up with her.

216
00:07:58,725 --> 00:08:01,042
Walk over there like, bam!

217
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:04,009
- Oh you're going to
talk to her with words.

218
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:05,261
- No no, of course not.

219
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,958
I'm gonna walk over
there, come up behind her,

220
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:09,307
grind up on her booty while
she's dancing with her friend.

221
00:08:09,307 --> 00:08:10,640
Girls love that.

222
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:17,485
- The night ends with you
eating some greasy junk food.

223
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:18,959
I'm gonna marry this pizza.

224
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,292
I'm gonna marry this pizza.

225
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,278
- It's so good I'm about to cry.

226
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:25,298
- Getting back to your
friends house or a hotel

227
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:27,769
looking like a hot mess.

228
00:08:27,769 --> 00:08:30,019
(retching)

229
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:32,211
I'm so sorry.

230
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,739
- Dude your hair is so soft.

231
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:37,624
- I can't do anything right,

232
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,533
and I can't hold my alcohol,

233
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,350
and every time I try to draw clouds,

234
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,977
they look like croissants.

235
00:08:43,977 --> 00:08:46,656
Yet somehow you manage to do this.

236
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:49,489
(phone vibrating)

237
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:56,039
(talking over each other)

238
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,392
- Hey dad, how's it going?

239
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:59,383
- Hello Lilly, where
the bloody hell you are?

240
00:08:59,383 --> 00:09:00,611
I call you so many time.

241
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:01,721
- I'm sorry dad.

242
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,396
I can't talk too much right now,

243
00:09:03,396 --> 00:09:04,744
but let me take a minute to sit right here

244
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,535
and tell you what happened, okay.

245
00:09:06,535 --> 00:09:09,805
Basically Elisa's life
got turned upside down.

246
00:09:09,805 --> 00:09:12,180
She spends most of her
days on the playground

247
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,962
chilling, relaxing, relaxing, all cool.

248
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:17,367
She was playing bball
outside of the school

249
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,881
and she got in a fight.

250
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:21,205
Her mom got scared and now

251
00:09:21,205 --> 00:09:23,548
she's moving with her
auntie and uncle in Bel-Air.

252
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,611
I'm just trying to calm everyone down.

253
00:09:26,611 --> 00:09:29,088
Listen, I can't talk right now.

254
00:09:29,088 --> 00:09:30,457
I gotta be a good friend.

255
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,700
- Okay, good girl, good night.

256
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,783
- Good night.

257
00:09:38,827 --> 00:09:41,497
I'd like to thank Elisa
for holding my hair.

258
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,439
- It's so soft.

259
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:46,701
- And Jager bombs for getting
me to where I am right now.

260
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,703
(retching)

261
00:09:48,703 --> 00:09:51,870
- What kind of conditioner do you use?

262
00:09:52,762 --> 00:09:55,526
- Clubbing, never again.

263
00:09:55,526 --> 00:09:56,716
- Yo, we gotta go.

264
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:59,169
It's ladies free before 11.

265
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:03,649
- At least that's what you'll
say ever single weekend.

266
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:04,482
Let's go.

267
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:11,236
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman and.

268
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,377
- It's your girl Elisa.

269
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:14,179
- Are you happy, we did it, we did it.

270
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,231
If you don't know who this is,

271
00:10:15,231 --> 00:10:16,357
check her out, she's wonderful.

272
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:17,863
Her link is in the description, Elisa.

273
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,389
My last video's right over there.

274
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,932
Our BTS and bloopers are right there.

275
00:10:20,932 --> 00:10:22,222
And yeah, make sure you subscribe,

276
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,714
'cause I make videos
every Monday and Thursday.

277
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:24,748
Y'all ready?
- Yeah.

278
00:10:24,748 --> 00:10:26,427
- [Both] One love Superwoman.

279
00:10:26,427 --> 00:00:00,000
That is a wrap, and zoop.
