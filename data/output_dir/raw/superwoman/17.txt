- No.

183
00:06:51,317 --> 00:06:52,533
- Oh God.
- You're fine.

184
00:06:52,533 --> 00:06:53,665
- No, I'm not.

185
00:06:53,665 --> 00:06:56,534
- [Justin] Lilly, you are
really upsetting me right now!

186
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:57,367
- Not the line.

187
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:58,433
- [Justin] What's the line?

188
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,516
(laughs)

189
00:07:03,859 --> 00:07:06,442
- Sorry, I just got off work.

190
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:08,275
I'm gonna freshen up a little bit.

191
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,483
We'll do that again?

192
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:10,604
Thanks guys, appreciate it.

193
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,298
I'm a trained professional.

194
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:14,548
Just want everyone to know.

195
00:07:21,511 --> 00:07:22,344
- Sue me.

196
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,511
- I can't do this anymore.

197
00:07:25,548 --> 00:07:27,857
- Stop overreacting, it's
not like I was cheating.

198
00:07:27,857 --> 00:07:29,983
- I don't know the line, sorry.

199
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:31,132
You must be a ladies man
because I believe you

200
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,055
even though I know you're lying,

201
00:07:32,055 --> 00:07:34,818
and you're gonna watch
another episode without me.

202
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:35,651
- Lilly.

203
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:37,412
(Lilly snoring)

204
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:38,994
Jesus Christ, Lilly!

205
00:07:38,994 --> 00:07:40,700
- You're always talking.

206
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,285
(laughs)

207
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:44,202
- Lilly.
- Stop talking.

208
00:07:45,236 --> 00:07:48,385
(Lilly snores)

209
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,635
- Unbelievable.

210
00:07:50,532 --> 00:07:53,281
Un (bleep) believable.

211
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:54,674
(laughs)

212
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,686
- Okay, I'll try to not
show so much cleavage,

213
00:07:56,686 --> 00:07:58,210
but I mean, if we want
it to be a good video.

214
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,293
(laughs)

215
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:06,028
Am I being a basic hoe and
drinking this whole thing now?

216
00:08:08,944 --> 00:08:09,926
Three and three.
- Bam.

217
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:11,652
- [Man] Switch the middle fingers.

218
00:08:11,652 --> 00:08:12,604
- [Lillie] Yeah, three and three.

219
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:14,155
And then switch the middle fingers.

220
00:08:14,155 --> 00:08:14,988
- Bam.

221
00:08:14,988 --> 00:08:15,821
- [Lillie] Boom, yeah, all right, great.

222
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,142
- This is so sick.
- Cool.

223
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,809
- I'm being awkward.

224
00:08:19,845 --> 00:08:21,879
Real life, real life.

225
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:24,217
- Okay, I'll laugh and
act like, I have never,

226
00:08:24,217 --> 00:08:25,054
we don't know that it's coming.

227
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:25,967
- Great, okay.

228
00:08:25,967 --> 00:08:28,608
So, my parents were just really
confused about what I did.

229
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,710
- Okay, should I wait to laugh?

230
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,071
- You should wait to laugh, yeah.

231
00:08:32,071 --> 00:08:33,294
Okay, so my parents.
(Chelsea laughs)

232
00:08:33,294 --> 00:08:35,563
- Girlboss, but there's a
dollar sign right before it,

233
00:08:35,563 --> 00:08:37,446
so dollar sign, Girlboss, okay?

234
00:08:37,447 --> 00:08:41,376
- That's supposed to be a
hashtag, that's a typo, my bad.

235
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:43,100
- So now, we'll pretend
to talk to each other.

236
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:43,933
- Okay great.

237
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,884
- So you have such pretty eyelashes.

238
00:08:45,884 --> 00:08:46,740
- Thank you.

239
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,655
This is an average amount of fun.

240
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:49,886
- And thank you for being here,

241
00:08:49,886 --> 00:08:51,366
I actually also don't
want to be here today.

242
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,171
- I know, I'm really scared of you.

243
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:54,004
- Yeah, okay, well good.

244
00:08:54,004 --> 00:08:54,962
I am glad.

245
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:57,510
(laughs)

246
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,234
And I'm gonna be interrupting you,

247
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,492
because you keep repeating yourself.

248
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:01,556
- Thank you.
- So, no.

249
00:09:01,556 --> 00:09:02,389
- It was okay.

250
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:03,222
- Are those your real eyes?

251
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:04,055
- They are.

252
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:05,018
- They look like contacts.

253
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:07,346
- Oh well, that's racist.

254
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,326
- Oh, whoopsie.

255
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:10,516
- Yo, hope you liked this blooper video.

256
00:09:10,516 --> 00:09:12,034
If you did, give it a big thumbs-up.

257
00:09:12,034 --> 00:09:13,776
January 1st, there's gonna be no video.

258
00:09:13,776 --> 00:09:15,492
January 4th is gonna be
a year-end review video.

259
00:09:15,492 --> 00:09:16,827
Keep an eye out to my Facebook

260
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:17,904
to find out how you can
get involved in that.

261
00:09:17,904 --> 00:09:18,737
Link is in the description.

262
00:09:18,737 --> 00:09:19,847
Other than that, make sure you subscribe

263
00:09:19,847 --> 00:09:21,611
because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday.

264
00:09:21,611 --> 00:00:00,000
One love, superwoman,
that is a wrap and zoom.
