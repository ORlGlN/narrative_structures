1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,089
- Rent, who is she?

2
00:00:02,089 --> 00:00:04,645
(bells ringing)

3
00:00:04,645 --> 00:00:07,383
(popping)

4
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:10,000
(twinkling)

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,693
What up, everyone, it's
your girl, Superwoman.

6
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:13,951
And the other day I was
watching TV with my friends,

7
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:15,622
you know, while I was
waiting for bae to come home.

8
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,738
- Your line into my world?

9
00:00:17,738 --> 00:00:19,542
Angels guard the sun.

10
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,622
- Yeah.

11
00:00:20,622 --> 00:00:22,311
- Aw, he's so cute.

12
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:24,971
- Damn, he could get it.

13
00:00:24,971 --> 00:00:27,010
- How is Jane still a
virgin with him around?

14
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,057
I would bend bend in
every direction for him.

15
00:00:29,057 --> 00:00:30,390
- Daddy, dad-dy.

16
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:33,853
- I would do everything to him.

17
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:35,804
- Take your shirt off, boo, come on.

18
00:00:35,804 --> 00:00:37,766
- His great thing with
Petra are you and me.

19
00:00:37,766 --> 00:00:38,820
- [Jane] Are you kidding me?

20
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,070
- Absolutely, I called you.

21
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,342
Wow, hey.

22
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:46,592
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetheart.

23
00:00:47,484 --> 00:00:49,820
So, you guys enjoying the season so far?

24
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,320
- Mm, it's decent.

25
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:53,304
- Hmm.

26
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,908
(crunching)

27
00:00:56,908 --> 00:00:57,905
Wait, are there carbs in that?

28
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:00,533
- The struggles of dating someone too hot.

29
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:01,504
Oh, wait, you hear that?

30
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:03,954
It's all the people
saying they can't relate.

31
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:04,812
Real talk, though, we all know

32
00:01:04,812 --> 00:01:05,862
the struggles of dating someone whack,

33
00:01:05,862 --> 00:01:07,323
or being single as hell.

34
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:08,156
But, yo, think about it

35
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:09,688
it's also probably really tough

36
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:12,302
to date someone that's a little too hot.

37
00:01:12,302 --> 00:01:13,886
I know what you're thinking,
shut up, hear me out.

38
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:15,365
First of all, when you're
in a relationship, right,

39
00:01:15,365 --> 00:01:16,799
people usually respect it enough

40
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,550
to not just straight up hit on your boo

41
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,475
but as your boo gets hotter,

42
00:01:20,475 --> 00:01:22,163
it becomes more and more okay

43
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:24,237
for people to say sexual
things about them.

44
00:01:24,237 --> 00:01:27,256
A.K.A
- Damn, he could get it.

45
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:29,032
- Are you telling me Gigi Hadid's friends

46
00:01:29,032 --> 00:01:29,865
aren't like to her,

47
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:32,865
"girl, Zayn be looking
like a gourmet snack."

48
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:34,283
Are you dumb, of course they are.

49
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:36,024
Like hoe, if you dating
this fine man, okay,

50
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:38,282
as your friend, I get to objectify him.

51
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,524
These are the rules.

52
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:41,432
If you dating Billy Bob Joe, have him.

53
00:01:41,432 --> 00:01:44,776
Okay, but if you dating
six foot tall sex bomb men,

54
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:46,726
we gon' share, okay, because this Monopoly

55
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:49,158
and those pecs are a community chest.

56
00:01:49,158 --> 00:01:50,453
Second of all, dating someone hot

57
00:01:50,453 --> 00:01:51,914
probably gives you mad trust issues.

58
00:01:51,914 --> 00:01:53,795
I mean, your boo could
be completely faithful,

59
00:01:53,795 --> 00:01:54,758
okay, but that's irrelevant

60
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,499
because you don't trust other people.

61
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:57,427
Why?

62
00:01:57,427 --> 00:01:59,860
Because you remember
the thirsty hoe you were

63
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,029
the first time you met his fine self.

64
00:02:02,029 --> 00:02:02,931
You tripping because you know

65
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,232
people like you exist out
there (chuckles) in the world.

66
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:06,938
I cannot with these boys.

67
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,163
- Amen.

68
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:08,996
- There are certain things

69
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,430
that are just deal breakers, you know?

70
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,399
- Yeah, like if his wife's crazy.

71
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,739
- You mean if you have a wife?

72
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,058
- Yeah, that's what I said.

73
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:17,660
- I just don't wanna date
anyone from the industry.

74
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,873
I don't wanna a movie star or an actor.

75
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,556
I don't want no one's baby
daddy, the end, no exceptions.

76
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:26,637
- Preach, girl.
- Straight up.

77
00:02:26,637 --> 00:02:28,133
- Excuse me, ladies,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

78
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,514
Do you know where the restroom is?

79
00:02:30,514 --> 00:02:32,931
(sexy music)

80
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:38,764
(twinkles)

81
00:02:38,764 --> 00:02:42,195
- Uh, no, but I have a
restroom at my house.

82
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:44,968
- I just came from set I
just want to freshen up.

83
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:46,675
- Oh my God, I was just talking

84
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:49,921
about how much I respect
the film industry.

85
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,960
No, thank you for your service.

86
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,972
- Aw, and it was my turn to
pick up my daughter at school.

87
00:02:54,972 --> 00:02:58,426
- Shut up, I love kids,
show me pictures right now.

88
00:02:58,426 --> 00:02:59,739
- Of course.

89
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,335
- That is so hilarious (giggles).

90
00:03:03,335 --> 00:03:05,918
(drum beating)

91
00:03:06,957 --> 00:03:08,427
(drum beating)

92
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:09,260
(chuckles)

93
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,151
Hoe, pass me some super glue

94
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:11,621
for these deal breakers right now.

95
00:03:11,621 --> 00:03:14,775
Just the biggest leech ever (chuffing).

96
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:17,757
I smell fresh, sexy blood (chhuffing).

97
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:22,090
Some people are too hot for
your irrelevant requirements.

98
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,120
With a face like that
put a stroller in my hand

99
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,993
and call me step-mom, boy, giddy up.

100
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,437
And because I was such a leech,

101
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:30,547
now I naturally think
everyone is also a leech.

102
00:03:30,547 --> 00:03:31,807
His assistant.

103
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:34,889
- Oh, good morning, sir (chuffing).

104
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,595
- [Lilly] The delivery girl.

105
00:03:36,595 --> 00:03:38,722
- Delivery for you, sir.

106
00:03:38,722 --> 00:03:40,322
(chuffing)

107
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:41,985
- [Lilly] His best friend.

108
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,665
- Hey, bro, you been working out?

109
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:46,627
(chuffing)

110
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:49,406
- The girl that wrote
this script (chuffing).

111
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:50,517
So, now I stay tripping, okay,

112
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,040
and I question him all the time,

113
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,921
even if he does nothing wrong.

114
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:56,800
(playful music)
(loud footsteps)

115
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,633
- Hey, babe.

116
00:03:57,633 --> 00:03:59,119
- Where you been?

117
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,885
- Work, obviously, where else would I be?

118
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,310
- Interesting, because
I called your office

119
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,780
and they said that you weren't there.

120
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,613
- When?

121
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,746
- Six minutes ago.

122
00:04:07,746 --> 00:04:09,556
- Because I was on my way home?

123
00:04:09,556 --> 00:04:11,411
- Mmm, okay, well how come

124
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:13,808
you didn't share your
Uber status with me then?

125
00:04:13,808 --> 00:04:15,926
- Because I drive myself.

126
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:17,562
Everyday now for two years.

127
00:04:17,562 --> 00:04:19,062
- Hmm, convenient.

128
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:21,641
Whose hair's on your shirt?

129
00:04:21,641 --> 00:04:24,308
(clears throat)

130
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,129
So, definitely not mine.

131
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:33,477
But straight up, that's
as far as that goes

132
00:04:33,477 --> 00:04:35,462
because when you're dating
someone a little too hot,

133
00:04:35,462 --> 00:04:37,081
it's impossible to argue with them.

134
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:38,560
Like, you can pretend to be mad

135
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
but you know that if y'all get in a fight

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,891
and he sleeps on the sofa,
really, it's your loss.

137
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:43,724
So, you try your best

138
00:04:43,724 --> 00:04:45,709
but your hormones simply
will not allow it.

139
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:47,861
- [Hot Bae] Getting tired
of you not trusting me.

140
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,681
- And I'm getting tired of your lies.

141
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:50,847
- [Hot Bae] Oh my God, listen to yourself.

142
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:52,333
You're being ridiculous.

143
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,177
- Okay, do not speak to me like that,

144
00:04:55,177 --> 00:04:57,094
I swear to God I will--

145
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,847
(sexy music)

146
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:07,907
I will walk over there and I
will effin' grope your bicep

147
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,191
because you're pissing me off.

148
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:11,024
- What?

149
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:12,615
- Yeah, that's right,
don't make me over there

150
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:17,068
and shove my tongue down
your throat because I will.

151
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:18,766
- I'm confused, are we fighting?

152
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:19,956
- Yeah, we're fighting, okay.

153
00:05:19,956 --> 00:05:22,482
You're so dumb you and your stupid

154
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:23,756
toned perfect abs, yeah,

155
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:26,520
I will totally come over
there and lick them.

156
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,075
- Lilly, you are really
upsetting me right now.

157
00:05:29,075 --> 00:05:31,045
- Oh, yeah, you're so
mad, take your shirt off.

158
00:05:31,045 --> 00:05:34,045
I bet you can't take your shirt off.

159
00:05:36,582 --> 00:05:38,075

What up, previous collab reference?

168
00:05:50,662 --> 00:05:51,495
Here's the thing, right,

169
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,060
when you're dating someone really hot,

170
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,262
you probably subconsciously defend them

171
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:57,379
even when they do act whack.

172
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,628
You just like that velvet
rope in a museum, just like,

173
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:02,796
"do not come for the art" (chuckles).

174
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,167
I think Justin forgot our anniversary.

175
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:07,223
- Rude, you need to dump him.

176
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:09,643
- Okay, calm down, he's such a great guy.

177
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:11,813
- How long have you been
waiting for that text back?

178
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:12,810
- Four hours.

179
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,840
But give him a break he's going
through a really tough time.

180
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,673
- Why?

181
00:06:15,673 --> 00:06:17,562
- Okay, well first of all,
he ordered a pizza yesterday

182
00:06:17,562 --> 00:06:19,740
and they accidentally put pineapple on it.

183
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,193
That's a lot.

184
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:22,112
- Are you serious?

185
00:06:22,112 --> 00:06:24,562
- Yeah, and he's just had
a really rough childhood.

186
00:06:24,562 --> 00:06:26,626
When he was growing up, his
aunt had a gluten allergy

187
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:31,386
and it was really tough on
him, so, back off, okay?

188
00:06:31,386 --> 00:06:34,852
Like, girl, what you out here
trying to suggest right now?

189
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,164
Don't be out here trying to take away

190
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,214
the one good thing I have

191
00:06:37,214 --> 00:06:39,192
with your uncalled for common sense.

192
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:41,441
You best be a good friend
and tell me to shut the f up

193
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:44,435
because I done won the
jackpot, girl, stop it.

194
00:06:44,435 --> 00:06:46,290
Because we're gonna live
happily every after, okay?

195
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:47,892
(chuffing)

196
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:49,116
Wait, no wait, stop stop.

197
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:51,382
That needs to stop moving, do not, do not.

198
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,319
You know when this video ends,

199
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,281
I'm gonna have to stop pretending

200
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,226
that I have a hot boyfriend.

201
00:06:54,226 --> 00:06:56,212
Stop, do not, Justin, Justin!

202
00:06:56,212 --> 00:06:57,516
Do not cut to the end.

203
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,293
(booms)

204
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,719
