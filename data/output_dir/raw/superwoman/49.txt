1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,718
- If your friend sent you this video

2
00:00:01,718 --> 00:00:03,326
to watch, there's a reason.

3
00:00:03,326 --> 00:00:05,647
(hoofbeats)

4
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:07,167
(whoosh)

5
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,100
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman,

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,857
and since the beginning of
time y'all have been asking me

7
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:14,562
to do the video "Types Of
Guys In Relationships".

8
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:16,821
And every single time, I've ignored you.

9
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:17,654
Why?

10
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:19,724
Because I can't write about
things I don't know about, okay.

11
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:21,756
It's been since forever
since I dated someone.

12
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:23,301
Like honestly, my most recent boyfriend?

13
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:25,234
He bought me an iPod
Shuffle for my birthday.

14
00:00:25,234 --> 00:00:27,514
But my friends date people, thus,

15
00:00:27,514 --> 00:00:29,395
Types Of Guys Your BFF Dates.

16
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:31,675
So grab your BFF, grab some popcorn,

17
00:00:31,675 --> 00:00:34,222
grab a booty 'cause it feels
noice, and get ready to relate.

18
00:00:34,222 --> 00:00:36,813
Number one, the Flaming Hot Cheeto.

19
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:38,435
Now this is the guy your BFF dates

20
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:40,229
that is hot as hell, okay.

21
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:44,704
I'm talking mus-cles,
chiseled jaw, boy band charm,

22
00:00:44,704 --> 00:00:47,658
but has the IQ of a Cheeto.

23
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:49,701
Beyond good looks, there's
just nothing there.

24
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:52,024
So, Alex, what do you do?

25
00:00:52,024 --> 00:00:53,634
- I chill.

26
00:00:53,634 --> 00:00:55,459
Do my thing.

27
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,514
- Do your thing.

28
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,764
And, and what is your thing?

29
00:00:57,764 --> 00:00:58,597
- Pfffft.

30
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:02,881
Spend time with Lauren.

31
00:01:02,881 --> 00:01:04,641
- (sighs) Does that pay well?

32
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:05,474
- Hmm?

33
00:01:05,474 --> 00:01:07,002
- It, it was a joke.

34
00:01:07,002 --> 00:01:08,268
- Who's there?

35
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,685
No wait, you say knock knock.

36
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:14,291
- You get me water?

37
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,967
And here's the most shocking part, right.

38
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:18,623
Usually when you ask this dumb person,

39
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:20,137
"Like yo, what do you do for a living?"

40
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:22,807
You cannot even fathom their response,

41
00:01:22,807 --> 00:01:24,156
you're just like hoe, how?

42
00:01:24,156 --> 00:01:25,179
I mean your job.

43
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:26,248
Like, what is your job?

44
00:01:26,248 --> 00:01:29,540
- Oh, I'm a financial planner.

45
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,373
- I'm sorry, what?

46
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:31,206
- Pfffft.

47
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:34,731
Financial means money.

48
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:40,503
I help people decide what
to do with their money.

49
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:42,729
Excuse me, I can't decide what to get,

50
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,062
'cause there's no pictures in this menu.

51
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,633
You know what?

52
00:01:48,633 --> 00:01:52,207
I'll just have the chicken par mesian.

53
00:01:52,207 --> 00:01:53,290
- Parmesan.

54
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,290
- Bless you.

55
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:58,737
- Then when you talk
to your girl, just like

56
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:00,771
"Yo girl, what, honestly what
the eff is happening here?"

57
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:02,407
She's gonna respond with some trash like--

58
00:02:02,407 --> 00:02:04,553
- I just love his personality.

59
00:02:04,553 --> 00:02:06,361
- "I just love his personality!"

60
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:08,104
Gah, you love his personality

61
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:09,664
when he ain't wearin' a shirt, get real.

62
00:02:09,664 --> 00:02:11,165
But you know, I can't even
hate it, I'm just jealous.

63
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:11,998
Girl, live your life.

64
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,682
Number two, the potential queen.

65
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,898
So you're meeting your best friend's

66
00:02:15,898 --> 00:02:17,041
boyfriend for the first time,

67
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,721
and something just seems a likkle bit off.

68
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:21,545
So you go through the
following thought process.

69
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:23,173
It's so nice to finally meet you.

70
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:24,006
- Same.

71
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:27,108
Uh, by the way, your hair looks great.

72
00:02:27,108 --> 00:02:28,865
- Thank you!

73
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:32,584
Ah, a man who appreciates
the little details.

74
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:35,164
- Hi there, could I get um, a Cosmo?

75
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:36,130
- Same.

76
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,461
- See, that's nice.

77
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:40,869
I love when a dude is secure
enough to order a girly drink.

78
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:44,070
So, Alex, what kind of music are you into?

79
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:48,950
- A little bit of everything,
but loving Fifth Harmony.

80
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,354
- Oh. That's really openminded.

81
00:02:52,354 --> 00:02:53,187
But also what?

82
00:02:53,187 --> 00:02:56,011
- And also, Alex loves football.

83
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,496
He's obsessed.

84
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:58,704
- Oh, okay.

85
00:02:58,704 --> 00:03:01,127
There we go, that's like a
stereotypical dude thing.

86
00:03:01,127 --> 00:03:02,796
- Seahawks?

87
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:03,629
Yasss.

88
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:07,164
- Wait... was that yes, or yas?

89
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:09,312
- Yas.

90
00:03:09,312 --> 00:03:10,321
- Spell it.

91
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,154
- Y...

92
00:03:11,154 --> 00:03:12,640
(suspenseful music)

93
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,473
A, S.

94
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:15,629
Yas.
- Yas.

95
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,587
- Girl, he gay.

96
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,339
My friend's just like,
"He's not gay, okay,

97
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:23,120
"he's just sweet and
understanding and sensitive and...

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
"holy crap, he's gay."

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,872
- Number three, the waste man.

100
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,922
Now this is the dude your
best friend dates, that you've

101
00:03:28,922 --> 00:03:30,809
probably already heard about
through the grapevine, okay.

102
00:03:30,809 --> 00:03:32,400
Or you probably even met him before

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,477
when he was dating one
of your other friends,

104
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:37,518
or he's even accidentally
hit on you once before.

105
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,810
Or he just has that goddamn smile

106
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,472
where you wanna knock his teeth out

107
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,743
because he's definitely a player.

108
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:46,431
So, how long have you two been dating?

109
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:48,976
- One month, ah, three months.
- Three months.

110
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:49,809
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:52,274
And where did you meet?

112
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:53,733
- My ex's birthday party.

113
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,607
Yeah.
- They were having problems.

114
00:03:55,607 --> 00:03:57,876
- She had trust issues.

115
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:58,709
- Right.

116
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:05,865
(soft digital clicking sounds)

117
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:11,018
- [Waitstaff] You guys ready to order?

118
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,935
- Well hello, Jennifer.

119
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,922
What a unique name, is that Irish?

120
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,079
- Jennifer is a unique name, really?

121
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,246
- Oh, and that smile, wow.

122
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:23,924
- Jennifer Lawrence.

123
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:25,282
Hudson.

124
00:04:25,282 --> 00:04:26,265
Aniston.

125
00:04:26,265 --> 00:04:27,098
- You have Insta?

126
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,026
- Lopez, Jennifer Lopez.

127
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:29,859
No?

128
00:04:31,819 --> 00:04:33,225
No?

129
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:34,546
Here's the thing about the player, right,

130
00:04:34,546 --> 00:04:36,622
he's also somehow a
hypnotist, because your girl

131
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,465
is just blind to everything
that's happening.

132
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:41,271
Like homegirl stared at the eclipse

133
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,954
without those special
glasses, now you need to like,

134
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,363
spell it out for her in braille.

135
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:45,196
She'll say things like

136
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,553
"He's just being social and polite, okay?"

137
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,964
Yeah, yeah he's being
polite with his penis, girl.

138
00:04:49,964 --> 00:04:50,797
Wake up.

139
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,727
Number four, the catch.

140
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:55,650
All the annoying guys your
best friend could date,

141
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,000
this one is quite possibly
the most annoying.

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,818
Why? Because he's wonderful.

143
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:01,252
- And for our anniversary,

144
00:05:01,252 --> 00:05:03,621
he planned a surprise trip to Hawaii.

145
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:05,587
It was so romantic.

146
00:05:05,587 --> 00:05:06,576
- Hawaii?

147
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:08,169
- (sighs) She's too kind.

148
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:10,370
And enough about us.

149
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,847
Tell us about you, Lilly?

150
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,180
- I've never been to Hawaii.

151
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:18,493
(phone ringtone)

152
00:05:18,493 --> 00:05:22,266
Oh, aw, I'm so sorry, this is so rude.

153
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,908
It's Kevin.
- Oh, okay, yeah.

154
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,404
- Um, I have to take
this, but I'll be back.

155
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:29,357
Excuse me, excuse me, hey buddy!

156
00:05:29,357 --> 00:05:31,493
- Kevin is the child that Alex sponsors.

157
00:05:31,493 --> 00:05:33,914
- What?!
- Yeah, he saved his life.

158
00:05:33,914 --> 00:05:34,851
- Really?!
- And he just

159
00:05:34,851 --> 00:05:36,383
adopted a dog for him!

160
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,216
- Heh.

161
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:40,608
- The dog only has three legs,
but Alex believes in him.

162
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:41,441
- Hmm.

163
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:42,941
- He's also really good in bed.

164
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,774
- What?!

165
00:05:43,774 --> 00:05:45,433
- I said this bread,
it's really good bread.

166
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,266
(sighs)

167
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:47,352
He's also really good in bed.

168
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:48,185
- Dammit!

169
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,510
Like where did you find this perfect man,

170
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,959
and how can I obtain one?

171
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,852
No straight up, because, you
know, just those rare moments

172
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,333
where you're just like "This guy

173
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,950
"is too good for my trash friend", okay.

174
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,257
I know that sounds
mean, but let's be real.

175
00:05:58,257 --> 00:05:59,745
Some of your friends are trash.

176
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:01,136
I knew this one girl, she was a jerk.

177
00:06:01,136 --> 00:06:02,165
She was such a jerk!

178
00:06:02,165 --> 00:06:04,086
She used to drive past the speaker

179
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:06,518
and the first window at
a drive through, okay.

180
00:06:06,518 --> 00:06:09,264
And then just take whatever
paid for meal was provided.

181
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:10,645
Just like "Oh, thank
you, this is my order."

182
00:06:10,645 --> 00:06:11,989
Hoe, that's not your order.

183
00:06:11,989 --> 00:06:13,376
And I'm just like, how girls like that

184
00:06:13,376 --> 00:06:14,609
get sweet guys like this?

185
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:15,732
You know, hold up, just sec.

186
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:16,598
Hello, Karma?

187
00:06:16,598 --> 00:06:17,431
Yeah, where you at?

188
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:18,283
You want me to drop a pin?

189
00:06:18,283 --> 00:06:20,477
Number five, the quirk!

190
00:06:20,477 --> 00:06:22,413
So this dude seems pretty normal and nice,

191
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,140
and you're like "Holy hell, did my girl

192
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,845
actually find a decent
human being, like congrats!"

193
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:27,678
But then.

194
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:31,269
So then I said, "It
takes one to know one."

195
00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,436
(loud, grating laugh)

196
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,949
- You, you take one, and
if you don't take it,

197
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,116
you don't know it!
(wheezing and cackling)

198
00:06:50,081 --> 00:06:52,937
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,

199
00:06:52,937 --> 00:06:57,104
okay, okay, okay, alright. (sighs)

200
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:02,297
Can we have the check?

201
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,672
- They have some effin'
weird tendency or quirk

202
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:09,683
that your friend can't see
but is driving you insane.

203
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:12,172
- This was so much fun, we
should definitely do it again.

204
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:13,005
- Mm-hmm!

205
00:07:13,005 --> 00:07:15,239
- Yeah, for sure, let
us know your se-zual.

206
00:07:15,239 --> 00:07:16,072
- My what?

207
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,667
- Your se-zual.
- Your se-sual.

208
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,029
- Oh, my schedule.

209
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:21,143
- Yeah, that's what I said, se-zual.

210
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:23,360
- No, that's what I said.

211
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,355
- But me too.

212
00:07:24,355 --> 00:07:25,682
- You guys are saying the same thing.

213
00:07:25,682 --> 00:07:28,376
- How are we saying the same thing?

214
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:29,209
- Sezual.

215
00:07:29,209 --> 00:07:30,709
- It's sk-edge-ual

216
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,835
- Sezual.
- Skedgeual.

217
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:34,876
- Sezual.

218
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:35,709
Schedule.

219
00:07:38,023 --> 00:07:38,987
- That's what I said.

220
00:07:38,987 --> 00:07:40,363
- Anyways, you know what
the best kind of guy

221
00:07:40,363 --> 00:07:41,708
your friend can date is?

222
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,636
The one that has a single hot brother

223
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:46,624
who has low self esteem,
that I can come scoop up.

224
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:47,457
Sign me up, hoe.

225
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:49,205
Speaking of sign up, don't go anywhere!

00:07:49,205 --> 00:07:50,613

not that many bells in your life.

232
00:07:58,538 --> 00:08:00,209
