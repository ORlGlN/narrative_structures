You should be praying.

Or calling police, "Hello,
crazy people escape jail."

68
00:01:39,597 --> 00:01:40,845

This is not appropriate
office behavior, okay?

100
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:41,208
Uh!

Go home.

115
00:03:06,046 --> 00:03:08,292
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

116
00:03:08,292 --> 00:03:11,302
Why this old man from Disney

- Not those balloons.

123
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:23,841
- This why you should sniff glue.

124
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,501
- Drugs.

125
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:27,381
- This why God is mad.

126
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:30,511
- This why we can't have nice things.

127
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:32,172
- You know what you should have every day?

128
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,692
Baptism.

00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:34,525
Detention.

130
00:03:35,572 --> 00:03:36,959
Exorcism.

131
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,937
- This why Trump is president.

132
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:39,799
- You see this one?

133
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:41,915
