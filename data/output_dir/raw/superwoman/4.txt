00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:04,270
(chimes ring)
(unicorn gallops)

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,140
- Welcome to therapy, Lilly.

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,150
Tell me, what's on your mind?

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,983
- Okay.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,900
I just feel like sometimes the

6
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,030
world is against me, you know?

7
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,040
- Why do you say that?

8
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,670
- I mean for starters, me and my

9
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,340
friends never see eye to eye.

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,160
I guess, there's a lot of tension there.

11
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:27,420
- What do you disagree on?

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,100
- Everything.

13
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,229
Just the other day, my
friend got mad at me,

14
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:33,590
because I wanted to stay home and watch

15
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,760
Black Mirror, instead of going out.

16
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,840
Like, I get it's your birthday,
but there's new episodes.

17
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,880
- I see.

18
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,770
- Yeah, and then, she started to go on

19
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,670
this whole rant about every
single thing she's ever

20
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,660
done for me, and I personally
think that's petty.

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,630
Yeah, I don't do that, 'kay?

22
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,450
Like, how many times am I gonna have

23
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,601
to hear the story about how
she donated me a kidney?

24
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,434
I get it.

25
00:00:57,802 --> 00:00:58,635
Yeah, I know.

26
00:00:58,635 --> 00:00:59,990
What about last week, when her

27
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,270
car broke down on the highway?

28
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,380
Who did she call?

29
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,220
So, who's really the bad friend?

30
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,770
- Was she at least grateful
when you went to pick her up?

31
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:11,290
- What?

32
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,380
Oh, no.

33
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,890
No, no, no, I called
her an Uber from my bed.

34
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,580
There's new episodes of Black Mirror.

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,030
Aren't you writing this down?

36
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,640
- Yeah.

37
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,473
Okay.

38
00:01:23,473 --> 00:01:26,090
I'm gonna show you a series of images.

39
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:26,923
- Porn?

40
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:32,009
- And I want you to tell me what you see.

41
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,430
(whimsical orchestral music)

42
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,460
- A terrible piece of art

43
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,670
by a terrible painter

44
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,540
who will likely never make it.

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,373
It's pretty bad.

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,600
Kinda looks like my sister,

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,610
when she got dumped.

48
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:54,104
Huh, that's funny.

49
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,526
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,910
That's a picture of me.

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,152
Yeah, no.

52
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:09,779
No, the legs are a dead giveaway.

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,450
That, that's me, is that me?

54
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,253
- Interesting.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,400
- What do you think is wrong with me?

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,796
Do I have anxiety from
being right all the time?

57
00:02:20,796 --> 00:02:22,160
Or maybe I'm depressed because

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,060
of other people's bad choices.

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,170
Like, wearing Crocs.

60
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,590
A lot of people do that.

61
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,870
- No, I think, in my professional opinion,

62
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,900
the issue is that

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
you're a bad person.

64
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,780
- Hmm?

65
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,130
- You're a mean, selfish, arrogant,

66
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,320
self-centered person, who needs to work on

67
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,130
not being such a terrible human.

68
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,343
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,030
So,

70
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,127
is there like a pill for that, or?

71
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,044
(boom)

72
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,320
That awkward moment when
you think something's

73
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,920
wrong with you, but
really, you're just a jerk.

74
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,300
If you like this video,
give it a big thumbs up.

75
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,760
Check out my last video, right over there.

76
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,670

78

Here's a sneak peak of the next one.

79
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,240
One love Superwoman,
that is a wrap, and zoop!

80
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,760
- Methinks I stole her watch?

81
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,593
- Wait, what?

82
00:03:16,593 --> 00:00:00,000
- Okay, I don't think, I know.
