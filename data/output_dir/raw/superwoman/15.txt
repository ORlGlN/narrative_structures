1
00:00:00,138 --> 00:00:02,171
- First comedy video of 2018.

2
00:00:02,171 --> 00:00:04,021
Give it a thumbs up after you watch it

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:05,640
just in case it's trash.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,395
(unicorn galloping)

5
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:10,228
What up everyone?

6
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:11,176
It's your girl Superwoman.

7
00:00:11,176 --> 00:00:13,274
And it's a new year which
means a lot of people

8
00:00:13,274 --> 00:00:15,726
are on that new year,
new me vibe, you know?

9
00:00:15,726 --> 00:00:17,831
Making crazy decisions
likegoing to the gym,

10
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,054
changing their hair,
and the most terrifying,

11
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,730
deciding to get married.

12
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,281
I personally thought marriage
was one of those trends

13
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,549
that we were gonna leave in
2017 with like fidget spinners

14
00:00:25,549 --> 00:00:28,106
and irresponsible vlogging,
but apparently not.

15
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:29,310
It's here to stay.

16
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,636
Friends, friends everywhere
getting engaged, and if you

17
00:00:31,636 --> 00:00:33,502
think it's not happening
to you, you're wrong okay?

18
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:35,978
Just check the international
marriage database.

19
00:00:35,978 --> 00:00:38,116
Ring pictures, same-day edits,

20
00:00:38,116 --> 00:00:40,705
captions about marrying
your loyal best friend,

21
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:42,174
and I'm just like you're
marrying your dog?

22
00:00:42,174 --> 00:00:44,180
Prepare yourself for the weddings of 2018

23
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,566
by expecting the
following types of people.

24
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,566
Number one: painful public speakers.

25
00:00:50,486 --> 00:00:52,577
Now these are the friends and
family members of the couple

26
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:55,973
but have no public speaking
abilities or experience,

27
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,988
but they up there making the
speech anyways just as if

28
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:01,057
I just hit puberty damn
damn I just hit puberty.

29
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:04,799
God damn finally at the tender age of 21.

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,645
Okay wait, now before
you think I'm evil, okay,

31
00:01:06,645 --> 00:01:09,228
I'm all for people's friends
and family expressing

32
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:11,809
their love and pride and all
that stuff for the couple.

33
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,747
That's fine, but I feel
like if your friend

34
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:15,779
is gonna make a speech at your wedding,

35
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:17,381
you should at least prep them.

36
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:21,468
For example, require
them to write it down.

37
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:24,301
(people chatting)

38
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:29,999
(microphone feedback)

39
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:33,384
- Hello everybody.

40
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,551
Uh, Pat, buddy, huh? Uh...

41
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:40,499
Okay, I'm... I'm Pat's friend.

42
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:42,910
Hello. Hi.

43
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,412
Pat, you know, Pat's the...
what can I say about Pat?

44
00:01:46,412 --> 00:01:48,245
Pat's the type of guy who everybody

45
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:50,194
knows the type of guy that Pat is.

46
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,132
Maybe you don't know, but his friend...

47
00:01:52,132 --> 00:01:52,965
I'm Pat's friend. Hello.

48
00:01:52,965 --> 00:01:57,132
Everybody, we all know the
type of guy that Pat is

49
00:01:58,138 --> 00:02:00,989
because Pat's the type of guy you just

50
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:04,239
on his wedding, you wanna say uh, yeah.

51
00:02:07,747 --> 00:02:11,914
He's like the type of guy
where everybody knows...

52
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,574
You know what type of guy Pat is.

53
00:02:15,574 --> 00:02:17,657
I love you buddy. Cheers.

54
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:21,658
Like hoe, this is not an essay okay?

55
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,205
You do not need to hit the word count.

56
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:26,022
I leave that wedding not knowing
a single thing about Pat.

57
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:27,920
Also, there should be guidelines about

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,806
the types of stories
they're allowed to tell.

59
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:32,808
- Yo, what's good?

60
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,896
Yo let me tell you a funny
story about my boy junkie.

61
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,558
Yo the day he met pretty, right?

62
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,664
They just finished their date or whatever.

63
00:02:39,664 --> 00:02:41,438
And he's like yo I wanna roll one, right?

64
00:02:41,438 --> 00:02:43,744
Like, you know, get high and stuff?

65
00:02:43,744 --> 00:02:44,626
Junkie loves drugs.

66
00:02:44,626 --> 00:02:46,278
That's my boy.

67
00:02:46,278 --> 00:02:47,615
There's a devil sitting there, you know,

68
00:02:47,615 --> 00:02:49,705
smoking a thing and a
sweeter thing walks by.

69
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:52,219
Junkie goes and gets them digits.

70
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,892
That's my boy right there.

71
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:54,833
You're my boy.

72
00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:55,666
You know what I'm saying?

73
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:58,145
So pretty I tell you
you're mad lucky still fam

74
00:02:58,145 --> 00:03:00,662
because this guy, he's fire.

75
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,869
He gets all the gals all the time.

76
00:03:02,869 --> 00:03:06,906
Even today, I saw mad gals on his thing.

77
00:03:06,906 --> 00:03:08,117
You know what I'm saying?

78
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:11,399
Yo, anytime I ever wanted
anything, Junkie stole it for me.

79
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,232
That's what's up.

80
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:14,752
All the bridesmaids, holla
at your boy, you know?

81
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:15,585
What's good, fam?

82
00:03:15,585 --> 00:03:17,668
D-Town represent. My boy.

83
00:03:19,294 --> 00:03:20,544
Alright, Singh.

84
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:22,427
- Are you dumb?

85
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:23,260
Are you dumb?

86
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,491
No, are you dumb?

87
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:25,874
Why are you trying to
make their wedding day

88
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:27,383
the same day their grandma
had a heart attack?

89
00:03:27,383 --> 00:03:28,216
Are you dumb?

90
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:31,731
Not to mention that a speech
should be like two minutes max.

91
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,044
Some people are up there forever,

92
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:34,254
and they don't even realize it.

93
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:36,119
I'm just like, bruh, the
couple's already divorced.

94
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,256
Sit down.

95
00:03:37,256 --> 00:03:39,169
Number two: the drunk unk.

96
00:03:39,169 --> 00:03:40,687
I'm gonna be honest, I'm
not sure if this is like

97
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,431
a universal thing or just something

98
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,253
that I know because I'm Punjabi.

99
00:03:44,253 --> 00:03:45,365
Like comment below and let me know.

100
00:03:45,365 --> 00:03:48,399
Every wedding has that one drunk uncle

101
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:51,613
who is sweating profusely that
takes over the entire event.

102
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,180
And sweating is mandatory, okay?

103
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,727
If he ain't sweating,
it's not the drunk unk.

104
00:03:54,727 --> 00:03:55,952
His back needs to look like this.

105
00:03:55,952 --> 00:03:57,603
Like his shirt should look
like the world map, oksy?

106
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,834
Because if it doesn't, then
that's not the drunk unk.

107
00:03:59,834 --> 00:04:01,355
It's probably like his
understudy or something.

108
00:04:01,355 --> 00:04:03,653
Drunk unk is for sure gonna grab

109
00:04:03,653 --> 00:04:05,667
the microphone in the middle of dancing.

110
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:08,386
(upbeat music)

111
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:09,219
- Hold up, hold up.

112
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:10,743
Stop the music, stop the music.

113
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:11,718
Please, please.

114
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,096
Let me do it. Let me do it. Please.

115
00:04:14,096 --> 00:04:15,477
Hello everybody.

116
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:19,477
I want to say many happy
return to happy couple.

117
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,482
Johnny...

118
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:24,187
And Pablo.

119
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:28,402
You know I want to say Johnny remember

120
00:04:28,402 --> 00:04:31,152
that happy wife equal happy life.

121
00:04:32,254 --> 00:04:34,018
Maybe I'm wrong for doing like this.

122
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,069
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,319
But in my heart, I feel kid are future.

124
00:04:40,721 --> 00:04:41,868
Thank you.

125
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:42,701
Johnny...

126
00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:45,586
I am so happy today I am going to

127
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,247
give everybody 50% off sofa, okay?

128
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,542
And one for Mitchell.

129
00:04:49,542 --> 00:04:50,912
Come talk to me.

130
00:04:50,912 --> 00:04:52,670
Okay. Play Justin Bieber.

131
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,006
- Drunk unk is for sure
gonna get pissed off

132
00:04:55,006 --> 00:04:57,359
when the DJ tries to end the night.

133
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,220
- What are you doing, man?

134
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,298
No, just one more.

135
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:01,131
One more.

136
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,340
No shut up, okay?

137
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,173
Shut up.

138
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,438
One more Justin Bieber.

139
00:05:08,623 --> 00:05:10,540
One more Justin Bieber.

140
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:15,112
- And drunk unk gonna be
all up on the dance floor

141
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:18,185
dancing with sexual undertones
but not realizing it.

142
00:05:18,185 --> 00:05:20,768
(upbeat music)

143
00:05:42,325 --> 00:05:43,366
Is it just me or are all uncles

144
00:05:43,366 --> 00:05:44,704
like homosexual when they're drunk?

145
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:47,507
And from their sexual
movements when they're drunk,

146
00:05:47,507 --> 00:05:48,980
you're like yo I got a lot of questions

147
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,905
about how my cousin was conceived

148
00:05:50,905 --> 00:05:53,383
because clearly the man has no rhythm.

149
00:05:53,383 --> 00:05:56,817
So like, did my aunt have to learn how to

150
00:05:56,817 --> 00:05:59,650
offbeat to get pregnant because I-

151
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:02,668
Is my cousin adopted?

152
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:05,197
Number three: the evasive camera guy.

153
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:08,549
Quite possibly the most annoying
person at a wedding is the

154
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:12,185
invasive camera guy that takes
his job way too seriously.

155
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,933
In the way 100% of the time.

156
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,207
Blocking your view from the
action 100% of the time.

157
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,897
Yeah you'll have your wedding
video in three months.

158
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:18,904
100% lying.

159
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:20,124
Just while you're dancing.

160
00:06:20,124 --> 00:06:22,707
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:26,149 --> 00:06:28,451
while you're eating.

162
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:29,341
- There she is.

163
00:06:29,341 --> 00:06:31,008
Alright, here we go.

164
00:06:33,376 --> 00:06:34,209
- Thank you.

165
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:35,042
Okay, thank you so-

166
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:35,875
Thank you.

167
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:36,708
Thank you so much.

168
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,521
- There it is.

169
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:39,581
- During the kiss.

170
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:41,021
- You may now kiss the bride.

171
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:43,854
(camera clicking)

172
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,408
- Take it easy, okay?

173
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,435
Do you realize that the
moment portrait mode

174
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:54,056
starts working in low
light you won't have a job?

175
00:06:54,056 --> 00:06:56,139
Number four: water works.

176
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:01,636
So stupid.

177
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:03,160
Here's my question.

178
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,074
Have movies like Moana, Coco, Inside Out

179
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:09,023
not prepared you for the
harsh realities of the world?

180
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:12,564
Why are there still so many
people crying during weddings?

181
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:14,777
Like okay, maybe I understand the parents

182
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:17,544
and the siblings and the
close family et cetera.

183
00:07:17,544 --> 00:07:19,118
But they'll be randos.

184
00:07:19,118 --> 00:07:22,266
Okay I'm talking straight
up wedding set extras

185
00:07:22,266 --> 00:07:24,060
that got invited through like effing

186
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,740
Cajiji and Craigslist and crap, okay.

187
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,262
They're just bawling their eyes out.

188
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:29,078
And also like what exactly
are you crying about?

189
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:31,284
They are happily getting married.

190
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,223
You out here acting like
Mufasa just died again.

191
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:34,056
Like what?

192
00:07:34,056 --> 00:07:36,556
(loud crying)

193
00:07:37,534 --> 00:07:38,428
- There, there.

194
00:07:38,428 --> 00:07:40,274
It's gonna be okay.

195
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,191
- They grow up so fast.

196
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:46,161
- How do you know the couple?

197
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,380
- Oh, I don't.

198
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,537
I'm just part of the catering.

199
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:51,549
- There we go.

200
00:07:51,549 --> 00:07:52,549
Keep crying.

201
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,708
- Number five: bitter bridesmaids.

202
00:07:57,708 --> 00:07:59,427
Now it's important to
remember that the wedding

203
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,427
is not just about the bride, okay?

204
00:08:01,427 --> 00:08:03,294
It's about the bridesmaids and

205
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,110
the one job they're there to do.

206
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,943
Support the bride?

207
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,758
Don't be a moron, this isn't Twilight.

208
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:09,209
The bridesmaids are there to prove

209
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:11,086
that they are closest to the bride.

210
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:12,963
Closer than any of the other bridesmaids.

211
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:13,796
That's right.

212
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:14,629
It's actually there wedding, okay?

213
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:15,462
It's about them.

214
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,157
Because every bridesmaid
believes in her heart that yeah

215
00:08:18,157 --> 00:08:20,692
all the rest of y'all hoes
are here for aesthetic but me,

216
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:25,596
I'm the one true bridesmaid
that is closest to the bride.

217
00:08:25,596 --> 00:08:27,109
For sure they'll be
some sort of competition

218
00:08:27,109 --> 00:08:28,899
in the speeches like yeah well
you know me and the bride,

219
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:30,600
you remember that time we made out once?

220
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,255
The next girl just be like
yeah, well you know me and

221
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,616
the bride, we've known
each other since grade two.

222
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,254
Shh. You hear that?

223
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:38,107
All that passive aggressiveness.

224
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,788
As a result of this, you
would think that the bride

225
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:42,385
is dying of like some
sort of terminal illness

226
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:45,327
the way all the bridesmaids
are at her beck and call.

227
00:08:45,327 --> 00:08:46,560
- Are you hungry? Have you eaten?

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,164
What can I get you?

229
00:08:48,164 --> 00:08:49,385
- You look so beautiful.

230
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,289
Okay, don't worry about anything.

231
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,679
I love you.

232
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,581
- Are you thirsty?

233
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,376
Let me get you water.

234
00:08:54,376 --> 00:08:57,141
- Tell me what you need.

235
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:57,994
- Are you itchy?

236
00:08:57,994 --> 00:08:59,375
Tell me where.

237
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,329
Just tell me where.

238
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,569
- Straight up bridesmaids
are the only people who post

239
00:09:02,569 --> 00:09:06,006
more pictures about the
wedding than the actual couple.

240
00:09:06,006 --> 00:09:08,565
Like when the hell did y'all
have your own photo shoot?

241
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:10,126
Just like yo, the bride
is crying with her family.

242
00:09:10,126 --> 00:09:11,136
We've got five minutes.

243
00:09:11,136 --> 00:09:12,016
Who got the best phone?

244
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,263
How do I know this you ask?

245
00:09:13,263 --> 00:09:17,430
Please. Because I've been
that basic hoe bridesmaid.

246
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,434
Real talk though.

247
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:21,268
Don't be offended by this video

248
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:23,431
if you are engaged, if you're
married, or whatever else

249
00:09:23,431 --> 00:09:26,233
cause leave getting offended
behind in 2017, okay?

250
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,303
This is all good vibes.

251
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:30,012
And if you're genuinely
happy about getting married

252
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:33,595
then I am happy for you and I
wish you nothing but the best.

253
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:36,505
I hope your wedding hashtag flourishes.

254
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:38,776
I've actually been considering
marrying my own bae, too.

255
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,431
I know it's crazy but
I've been considering it.

256
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:42,083
You know what?

257
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:43,555
First video, I'm gonna show you a picture.

258
00:09:43,555 --> 00:09:45,212
First time I'm gonna show you a picture.

259
00:09:45,212 --> 00:09:47,492
We are so adorable.

260
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:49,295
Aren't we so cute?

261
00:09:49,295 --> 00:09:50,517
Look at us.

262
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:51,767
Me and the bae.

263
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,483
Yo yo, not so fast.

264
00:09:53,483 --> 00:09:54,316
Hold on.

265
00:09:54,316 --> 00:09:55,149
Wait, not so fast.

266
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:56,175
Before I go to the end
card I gotta tell you

267
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:58,234
if you like my sweater,
my girl love sweater,

268
00:09:58,234 --> 00:09:59,598
what's stronger together on the sleeves,

269
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:00,867
as well as a whole bunch of other merch,

270
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:03,450
you can get it at lillysingh.com.

271
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:06,111
It's available right now and
it's super soft and it's lit.

272
00:10:06,111 --> 00:10:07,876
If you don't believe me, ask Twitter

273
00:10:07,876 --> 00:10:09,553
because if it's on the Internet it's true.

274
00:10:09,553 --> 00:10:10,386
Okay bye.

275
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:14,240
- Talking about my boy Humble, yo.

276
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,444
Still this guy.

277
00:10:15,444 --> 00:10:17,873
Like 10 years ago I'ma
call myself Humble the Poet

278
00:10:17,873 --> 00:10:20,911
cause that's not a long
hashtag or username.

279
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,021
- Everybody knows.

280
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:26,396
His friends know, but
maybe you don't know.

281
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:27,488
Sorry.

282
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:30,154
He was so absent, let
me tell you one time.

283
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,617
Bringing up a Monopoly deal.

284
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,132
I done him.

285
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,799
He got canceled fam.

286
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:40,049
(laughter)

287
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,900
I've seen just so many morons do this.

288
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,065
Sorry. Sorry fans.

289
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:49,112
If you've done this you're so talented.

290
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,855
Drexel, Scarborough.

291
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:52,465
It's an East Side thing, eh?

292
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:54,391
Humble the Poet signing out.

293
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:56,463
I only got two minutes
to fill your cranium

294
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:59,380
and three minutes to fill whatever.

295
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:02,648
