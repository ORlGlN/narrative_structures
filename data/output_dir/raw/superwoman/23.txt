1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:03,143
(bells jingling)

2
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:09,774
- So what did you get up to last night?

3
00:00:09,774 --> 00:00:10,941
- Oh, nothing.

4
00:00:12,974 --> 00:00:14,329
- Cool.

5
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:15,640
- But did you see what I did with my face?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,506
I said...

7
00:00:16,506 --> 00:00:17,613
Nothing.

8
00:00:17,613 --> 00:00:18,849
That means I did something,

9
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:20,249
but I just want you to get it outta me.

10
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,726
- God, you're a lotta work.

11
00:00:21,726 --> 00:00:23,379
So, what were you up to last night?

12
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:24,212
- Oh, me?

13
00:00:25,304 --> 00:00:26,243
Nothing.

14
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:27,558
- You're doin' it again.

15
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:28,588
Okay.
(Lilly slurps)

16
00:00:28,588 --> 00:00:31,552
- Oh my god, Lilly, I'm so dying to know

17
00:00:31,552 --> 00:00:32,823
what you did last night.

18
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:34,542
Please tell me, tell me, tell me.

19
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:35,401
- Okay, fine.

20
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:36,388
If you insist.

21
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:37,616
God, you're so nosy.

22
00:00:37,616 --> 00:00:40,116
I totally went out with a boy.

23
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,179
- Okay, cut to the chase.

24
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,369
Did you wake up with a boy?

25
00:00:43,369 --> 00:00:44,807
- No, I did not wake up with a boy.

26
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,262
But I totally kissed a boy.

27
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:48,861
- You (beep)?

28
00:00:48,861 --> 00:00:49,886
- No, this is kissing a boy.

29
00:00:49,886 --> 00:00:50,719
- Oh.

30
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:51,552
(kissing sounds)

31
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,385
- No, that's not--

32
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,346
This is when you actually have sex.

33
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:55,179
(scoffs)

34
00:00:55,179 --> 00:00:56,358
- Was it a lizzy kiss?

35
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:57,790
- What do you mean, "was it a lizzy kiss?"

36
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,878
- It's when you stick out your tongue,

37
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:02,741
and you lick the other person's lips.

38
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:03,806
Like this.

39
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:05,157
- No, stop that.

40
00:01:05,157 --> 00:01:05,990
Stop that.

41
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:07,164
Charlize, stop, we're in public.

42
00:01:07,164 --> 00:01:07,997
- That's how you do it.

43
00:01:07,997 --> 00:01:09,949
Everybody in this room
knows that's how you do it.

44
00:01:09,949 --> 00:01:11,667
- Innocent people, I'm so
sorry enjoy your coffee.

45
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:13,100
- You're like the only one
that doesn't know a lizzy kiss.

46
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,247
- We just put our lips together like

47
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,190
normal human beings.

48
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,023
God.

49
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:18,956
- Lame.

50
00:01:18,956 --> 00:01:19,991
- Okay, how is that lame?

51
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:21,677
- It's not what guys want these days.

52
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:22,742
- Really?

53
00:01:22,742 --> 00:01:25,325
How do you know what guys want?

54
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:27,954
(magazines slam)

55
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:28,853
- Right there.

56
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:30,333
That's how I know.

57
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,564
'Cause I read all of these.

58
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:32,588
- How big is your bag?

59
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:33,900
- This is everything you need to know

60
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,199
about how to please a guy
written by a group of women.

61
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,032
- Makes sense.

62
00:01:37,032 --> 00:01:40,415
- This month alone, there's
14 ways to kiss a guy,

63
00:01:40,415 --> 00:01:43,280
27 ways to style your pubic hair

64
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,148
and 72 ways to drive him wild in bed.

65
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:47,583
- 72 ways?!

66
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:48,416
Are you kidding?

67
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,386
I know like three.

68
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:50,494
Lingerie, sex...

69
00:01:50,494 --> 00:01:52,503
- Pouring hot oatmeal on his nipples...

70
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:53,336
- Yeah--

71
00:01:53,336 --> 00:01:54,169
What?

72
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:55,002
How is that number three?

73
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:55,947
How is that even a number?

74
00:01:55,947 --> 00:01:57,228
(scoffs)

75
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:59,561
- You've got a lot to learn.

76
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,444
- Twenty new sex tips?

77
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,672
Are you kidding me?

78
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,440
I thought sex involved one tip.

79
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,836
- No, you take a bath together.

80
00:02:06,836 --> 00:02:09,009
But be sure to put four
drops of lavender oil,

81
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,360
three drops of sandalwood and

82
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,877
a drop and a half of olive oil.

83
00:02:11,877 --> 00:02:12,821
You mix it in the water.

84
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:13,654
- Olive oil?

85
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:15,484
Wait, guys care about this stuff?

86
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:18,044
I thought guys liked
Call of Duty and butts.

87
00:02:18,044 --> 00:02:18,877
- Lilly!

88
00:02:18,877 --> 00:02:21,612
Guys know the difference
between essential oils.

89
00:02:21,612 --> 00:02:22,445
- Frig!

90
00:02:22,445 --> 00:02:23,546
Okay no wait, you're going too fast.

91
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:24,938
Tell me, how should I kiss him tonight?

92
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:26,796
Should I do the reptile thing?

93
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,175
- Oh my god that's so two issues ago.

94
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:29,008
- Okay, right.

95
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:29,841
Obviously, ew.

96
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:30,929
- Here's what you do.

97
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,106
First, you take three grapes,

98
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:34,582
and you put them in your mouth.

99
00:02:34,582 --> 00:02:35,415
- Okay, three grapes.

100
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:36,301
- Yes, do it.

101
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,400
- Right now?
- Yeah.

102
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,003
And then when he kisses
you, you massage his tongue

103
00:02:41,003 --> 00:02:42,521
with the grapes.

104
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,035
- Why wouldn't I just
do this with my tongue?

105
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:45,269
- What is this 1999?

106
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:46,102
- No.

107
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:46,935
- Oh my God.

108
00:02:46,935 --> 00:02:47,820
- No, ew, of course not.

109
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,621
- Step two, you keep your eyes wide open

110
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:52,297
like you're putting
eye drops in your eyes.

111
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,611
All the time, don't blink.

112
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:54,471
- Isn't that awkward?

113
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:55,375
- No, it's great.

114
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,646
- What do I do with the grapes after?

115
00:02:56,646 --> 00:02:58,492
- Well, you squish it on his back.

116
00:02:58,492 --> 00:02:59,643
Guys love that.

117
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,753
- I feel like an idiot.

118
00:03:00,753 --> 00:03:02,185
- No, actually it looks good.

119
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:03,906
You look like a desirable stripper.

120
00:03:03,906 --> 00:03:04,973
- Really?

121
00:03:04,973 --> 00:03:06,039
- Yeah, so now tell me how're you

122
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,321
gonna make babies with him?

123
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,926
- Okay, well...

124
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:13,201
I'm gonna go to his
house, take my pants off.

125
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:14,034
- Mmhmm.

126
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:15,046
- And then wrap my legs around him,

127
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:18,454
and have sweet consensual lovemaking.

128
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,287
- No!

129
00:03:19,287 --> 00:03:20,252
Wrong!

130
00:03:20,252 --> 00:03:22,424
Do you wanna end up with 38 cats?

131
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:23,984
- Just tell me what to do!

132
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:25,868
- You wrap your legs around an ice bucket

133
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:29,023
for 22 minutes 'til it's
really nice and numb,

134
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:30,497
and you can't feel anything.

135
00:03:30,497 --> 00:03:32,510
And then you let him bang you really fast.

136
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,162
And you listen to the "Frozen" soundtrack.

137
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:36,682
- That makes total sense.

138
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,363
My God, I don't know any of this.

139
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:39,799
He's never gonna find me attractive.

140
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:40,632
- Quick!

141
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:41,766
Three things to rub on his inner thigh.

142
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:42,668
- Okay, um...

143
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:43,501
- Too slow.

144
00:03:43,501 --> 00:03:44,470
- Oh, okay, my elbow.

145
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,948
Something like that, okay.

146
00:03:45,948 --> 00:03:48,245
A feather and apple slices.

147
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,145
- Bingo!

148
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,233
Now tell me the 16 best positions.

149
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,730
- 16?!
- Yes.

150
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,770
- Okay, uh, me on top, uh, him on top.

151
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,670
What else?

152
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,611
- Let's ask pink.

153
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,150
- I am not going to ask your
vagina for advice right now.

154
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,178
Oh okay, obviously.

155
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:02,121
That makes sense.

156
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:06,179
- She says you're on stilts
and he's on a trampoline.

157
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:07,154
- Pink would.

158
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:07,987
- It's great advice.

159
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:08,820
(iPhone beeps)

160
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,060
- Siri, can you remind me to
pick up Advil on the way home?

161
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,965
- Hey, listen Lilly whatever you do,

162
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:16,265
make sure you exfoliate with
raw sugar, honey, lime juice.

163
00:04:16,265 --> 00:04:17,538
- Exfoliate where?

164
00:04:17,538 --> 00:04:18,370
- Everywhere.

165
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,453
- Everywhere?

166
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,135
- Everywhere.

167
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:25,704
Guys love it.

168
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:26,726
- Ouch.

169
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:27,559
- Yes.

170
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:31,444
- Seein' Lily again tonight.

171
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:33,044
Gotta good feeling about it.

172
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,275
- You should get her flowers.

173
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,508
Girls dig that.

174
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,472
- That is a good idea.

175
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:39,472
(clink)

176
00:04:42,026 --> 00:04:43,213
- Thank you so much for
watching this video with--

177
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,202
- Charlize Theron.

178
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,104
- And she's amazing!

179
00:04:45,104 --> 00:04:46,783
Check out her organization, CTAOP.

180
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:47,809

00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,158
