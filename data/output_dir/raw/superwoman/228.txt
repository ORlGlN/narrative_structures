1
00:00:00,236 --> 00:00:03,028
♫ I love to wake up next to you ♫

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:05,476
- That's right, I'm in your bed with you.

3
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:07,392
(unicorn trotting and neighing)

4
00:00:09,052 --> 00:00:11,145
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman!

5
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:13,319
And real talk, on that real-real,

6
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:14,619
true story doh,

7
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:16,082
I don't remember the last time a video

8
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:18,154
was more requested than this one.

9
00:00:18,154 --> 00:00:19,434
Since the day the song came out,

10
00:00:19,434 --> 00:00:21,628
ya'll have been dying
to see my parent's react

11
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:23,292
to Zayn Malik's "Pillowtalk".

12
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,837
And I'm gonna be honest, I
didn't do it for a long time

13
00:00:24,837 --> 00:00:26,746
because I didn't know what to do.

14
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:28,656
I don't know what's
happening in that video.

15
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:29,875
But then I thought, you know what?

16
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,582
My parents are gonna absolutely nail it

17
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:33,288
because they always know what's happening.

18
00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:35,259
That's right, all those
nights in high school

19
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,172
when I was out late, they knew
exactly what was happening.

20
00:00:38,172 --> 00:00:40,215
They knew I was at the
library doing a group project.

21
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:40,956
(laughter)

22
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:42,987
So without further ado,
I hope you enjoy this

23
00:00:42,987 --> 00:00:44,877
very requested video
of my parent's reacting

24
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:47,629
to Zayn Malik's "Pillowtalk".

25
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:49,010
- Hello!

26
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,823
- Hello.

27
00:00:49,823 --> 00:00:50,473
- Hello.

28
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:51,569
- Hello.

29
00:00:51,569 --> 00:00:52,634
- Dirty girl.

30
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:53,813
- I comb my hairs.

31
00:00:53,813 --> 00:00:55,438
- Really handsome boy, huh?

32
00:00:55,438 --> 00:00:58,220
Hello Zayn, how you doing, huh?

33
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:00,698
He driving me in-zayn. (laughter)

34
00:01:00,698 --> 00:01:04,295
- Manjeet Singh, chandigarh, sector 17.

35
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:05,066
- Zayn.

36
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,367
- This right here?

37
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,850
This my brother.

38
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,451
You see, look, we almost twin, identical.

39
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,360
- Today we are reacting to Zayn Malik--

40
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,356
- Pillowtalk.

41
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,575
- I think it's going to be comedy.

42
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:16,729
You know I think it's going
to be sequel to that one Ted,

43
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:19,471
a talking teddy bear, except
this one, he's pillow.

44
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,015
- I think it's going to be great.

45
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,986
- Maybe Zayn talking in his sleep.

46
00:01:22,986 --> 00:01:25,973
- I think it's going to be
something for the entire family.

47
00:01:25,973 --> 00:01:27,618
- Maybe his best friend is pillow.

48
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:29,569
- I think there's going
to be a lot of friendship.

49
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:32,138
- Maybe he's hosting talk show, in bed.

50
00:01:32,138 --> 00:01:33,113
I want to be guest.

51
00:01:33,113 --> 00:01:36,060
- Technology, how else
the pillow going to talk?

52
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:36,580
- Okay.

53
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,725
- Let us watch Pillowtalk, come.

54
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:43,057
Oh, you see this? Friendship.

55
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:45,800

Hello Ted? Ted?

59
00:01:51,427 --> 00:01:53,611

62
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,863
- Something wrong with camera.

63
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,863
Lee, something's wrong

64
00:02:00,863 --> 00:02:03,876

65
00:02:04,784 --> 00:02:06,227
- What the bloody hell.

66
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:08,317

00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:19,776
- I don't, I don't understand.

71
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,992
(laughing)

72
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:33,063

73
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:35,583
this is not flower, this

74
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,534
Do you have flower Lilly?

75
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,260
That is a lady and her pee-pee.

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,906
- What the bloody hell happened here?

77
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,349
What the story line?

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:43,568
What is the plot?

79
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,335
Where is climax?

80
00:02:45,335 --> 00:02:48,026
Oh okay, there is climax. (laughs)

81
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:50,105
- Something wrong with
the computer, Lilly!

82
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:51,002
(knocking on monitor)

83
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:53,339
- Why this person have nail in their face?

84
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:57,341
Nail is for door, wood, God.

85
00:02:57,341 --> 00:03:01,039

91
00:03:10,861 --> 00:03:12,791
There is no direction in this.

92
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,599
- Who the bloody hell these people are?

93
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:17,179
- I'm being brainwashed (stuttering),

94
00:03:17,179 --> 00:03:18,448

95
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,459
- What kind of job is

00:03:28,606 --> 00:03:30,394
And why everything happen in smoke?

100
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,857
- Something wrong with computer,

00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:34,037

102
00:03:34,945 --> 00:03:37,064
- Smoke, smoke.

103
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:43,702
- You know what, it bores
on my very brain right now.

104
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:46,973
- This is no paradise, this bloody hell.

105
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:48,801
- What, what , what is it?

106
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:50,853
Now she breaking a guitar,

107
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,240
The guitar didn't, you crying? Good.

108
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,567
Good.

109
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,272
- Huh?

110
00:03:57,272 --> 00:03:58,979
You piss on the neighbors?

111
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,010
What the bloody hell the neighbors did?

112
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:03,164
- That's right, flower melting,
you know why flower melting?

113
00:04:03,164 --> 00:04:05,622
Because nature sad at this music video.

114
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:08,412
- Don't pee on neighbors.

115
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,656
- That's right, cry, you
see cry, that's right.

116
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:14,141
You know why you crying?
because you bad girl, okay?

117
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:17,284
Harold and Kumar going White Castle

118
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:19,485
have more meaning than this movie.

119
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:22,546
- My brother doing drugs.

120
00:04:22,546 --> 00:04:23,948
This need to be in garbage okay?

121
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:25,899
Garbage, not even recycling,

122
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,804
because I don't ever want to
see this being made again.

123
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,429
- Did you like it, did you
like it, did you like it?

124
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:31,587
I hope you did.

125
00:04:31,587 --> 00:04:36,016
♫ Let' piss on the neighbors ♫

126
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,682
Yo, if you liked this video, real talk,

127
00:04:37,682 --> 00:04:39,267
I know I always say this, but like,

128
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,461
click the thumbs-up if it
made you laugh or smile.

129
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:42,884
I wanna see how many thumbs-up we can get.

130
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:44,590
I know I always say this but
this time I'm gonna set a goal.

131
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,226
I wanna see if you can
get 300,000 thumbs-up.

132
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,648
I thought that should be easy,

133
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:52,330
there's 8 million in our family, 300,000.

134
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,077
And to answer your question, no,

135
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,545
I don't get a million dollars
every time the thumbs-up.

136
00:04:56,545 --> 00:04:59,592
Literally, I just wanna see
how many thumbs-up we can get.

137
00:04:59,592 --> 00:05:01,380
So don't make up no stories, okay?
