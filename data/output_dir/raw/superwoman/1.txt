1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,760
- Hi, I'm gonna smile an abnormal amount.

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,060
- Honestly, I forgot
this was happening today.

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,860
- I'm so nervous I might throw up.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,820
- Well, I've already judged
you based on how you look.

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,440
I tried not to, but I did.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,480
- Should I start lying now,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,020
or did you wanna small talk
about the weather first?

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,853
- You can just like, go ahead

9
00:00:21,853 --> 00:00:23,170
and say everything you wrote on there.

10
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:25,210
- Sure, well as you can see here,

11
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,090
I made up six years of experience.

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,260
- Head of marketing for Mr. Jones, nice.

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,093
- Correct.

14
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,880
That's my dad, I told him you might call,

15
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,590
and he has talking points already.

16
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,800
- So tell me about this
management position

17
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,550
at this company I've never heard of.

18
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,490
- Technically I wasn't an assistant

19
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,047
but I feel like I could've figured it out.

20
00:00:41,047 --> 00:00:42,340
- Mmhmm, lets see what other

21
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,500
interview questions I've googled here.

22
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,160
Ah, yes, why did you leave your last job?

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,240
- I just feel like I needed
a bigger challenge, you know?

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,374
And also I was fired.

25
00:00:51,374 --> 00:00:52,260
- Mmhmm, mmhmm.

26
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,580
Tell me about one of your many weaknesses,

27
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:56,700
and don't say perfectionist, you liar.

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,480
- Honestly, I don't really work that hard.

29
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,410
- So why do you want this job?

30
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,300
- I like money.

31
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,489
- Says here you're
proficient in Photoshop.

32
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,340
- Oh yeah, I face tune all
the time, its one in the same.

33
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,970
Potato, potato, am I right?

34
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,190
- Fluent in French, very nice lie.

35
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,170
- Oui.

36
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,850
I know exactly three words,
that was one of them.

37
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,160
- Mmm, trustworthy, I'm not
really sure that's a skill.

38
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,170
- Fair, it also depends
how many drinks I've had.

39
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,220
- I know it seems like I'm
taking informative notes

40
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,970
but really I'm just writing, "Don't hire."

41
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,170
literally, look, "Don't hire."

42
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,000
stupid answer, dumb dumb,
you're not getting the job.

43
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,230
- You know I'm sensing
this isn't going well

44
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,630
so I'm gonna say a bunch of buzz words.

45
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,463
- Go for it.

46
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:34,730
- Reliable, a team player, self starter.

47
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,260
- Mmm, maybe something about efficiency?

48
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,093
- Time management.

49
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:38,926
- There it is.

50
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,603
- Problem solver, eh?

51
00:01:40,603 --> 00:01:41,436
Eh?

52
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,480
- I'm really enjoying feeling
like I'm in power right now.

53
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,313
- Oh, fast learner.

54
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:45,720
- Listen, shut up.

55
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,710
You're talking a little too much

56
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,310
so I'm gonna tell you
about our company now.

57
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,800
- Oh, I'm squinting my eyes and nodding

58
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,180
as if I'm very interested.

59
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,870
- Same, yeah, no, I could care less

60
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,270
about this god damn company.

61
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,640
- Well I'm going to overthink everything

62
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
I said as soon as I walk out.

63
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,160
- We might settle for you.

64
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,610
- That's what I'm hoping for.

65
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,122
- Absolutely tragic, so sorry.

66
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:08,419
Aye, you alright there, mate?

67
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,379
If you like this video make
sure you smash your thumbs up.

68
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,740
If you check on my last
video right over there,

69
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,340

people that have acne,

70
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,610
you know spots on their face,

71
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,960

72
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,606

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,890
you know I want you to be there.

76
00:02:21,890 --> 00:00:00,000
One love superwoman
that is a wrap, and zoo.
