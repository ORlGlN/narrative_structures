1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:02,265
- You can help change the world
just by watching this video.

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:04,549
This is not clickbait, it is a fact.

3
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:06,882
(galloping)

4
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:10,626
What up everyone, it's
your girl Superwoman.

5
00:00:10,626 --> 00:00:12,768
And in case you don't know,
my real name is Lilly Singh,

6
00:00:12,768 --> 00:00:15,064
and today is my birthday.

7
00:00:15,064 --> 00:00:16,513
Thank you so much for all this wishes.

8
00:00:16,513 --> 00:00:18,189
I really, really appreciate it.

9
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:20,279
But this video is not about me.

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,252
365 days ago, I did a campaign
selling rafiki bracelets.

11
00:00:24,252 --> 00:00:25,517
Don't know what I'm talking about?

12
00:00:25,517 --> 00:00:26,869
Don't stress, I got you.

13
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:29,324
This is what we accomplished together.

14
00:00:29,324 --> 00:00:33,157
(singing in foreign language)

15
00:00:53,877 --> 00:00:55,888
- I am Superwoman.

16
00:00:55,888 --> 00:01:00,283
(singing in foreign language)

17
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,895
- I am Superwoman.

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,687
(singing in foreign language)

19
00:01:04,687 --> 00:01:06,897
- Lilly, we miss you so much.

20
00:01:06,897 --> 00:01:09,120
- And we wanted to say thank you.

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,201
(singing in foreign language)

22
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:13,987
- Thank you for helping
me get an education.

23
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,167
- Thank you for believing in my dreams.

24
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:19,101
(singing in foreign language)

25
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:21,598
- Thanks to you, I can become a doctor.

26
00:01:21,598 --> 00:01:23,549
- An engineer.

27
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,224
- A neurosurgeon.

28
00:01:25,224 --> 00:01:27,899
(singing in foreign language)

29
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:30,602
- [All] I am Superwoman.

30
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:34,435
(singing in foreign language)

31
00:01:37,109 --> 00:01:38,131
This year, for my birthday,

32
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:42,313
I so excited to announce
GirlLove rafikis v2.0

33
00:01:42,313 --> 00:01:44,049
in partnership with WE Charity.

34
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:45,174
Now hold on, hold on,
hold on, don't click away,

35
00:01:45,174 --> 00:01:46,132
I know what you're thinking.

36
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,690
You've probably heard stuff
like this so many times.

37
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,367
And I could make a really long video

38
00:01:49,367 --> 00:01:50,983
telling you a million reasons

39
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:52,510
why I'm doing this campaign again.

40
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,042
And I could give you
a million more reasons

41
00:01:54,042 --> 00:01:55,589
why you should support it,

42
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:56,422
but I'm not gonna to do that.

43
00:01:56,422 --> 00:01:58,001
I'm gonna make this short,
simple, and to the point.

44
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,637
These are straight facts.

45
00:01:59,637 --> 00:02:02,993
Each one of these rafikis is
hand-made by a mother in Kenya.

46
00:02:02,993 --> 00:02:06,732
I have met these mothers and
made these rafikis with them.

47
00:02:06,732 --> 00:02:07,673
Number two.

48
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:10,914
The sale of each rafiki helps
girls in Kenya go to school.

49
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:14,111
It goes towards school supplies,
uniforms, and school fees.

50
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:16,405
I've met these girls, and
I've been to their school.

51
00:02:16,405 --> 00:02:17,238
Number three.

52
00:02:17,238 --> 00:02:18,941
I just came back from
Kenya a few weeks ago,

53
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,827
and I designed this new rafiki myself.

54
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:22,155
I picked the color, which is gold,

55
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:23,492
these cute little square beads,

56
00:02:23,492 --> 00:02:25,058
it still has a GirlLove pendant on it.

57
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:27,807
It's slightly longer than
last year's rafiki, why?

58
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:30,892
Because I wanna make sure our
brothers can also sport it

59
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:31,796
and spread some GirlLove.

60
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:32,772
Number four.

61
00:02:32,772 --> 00:02:34,450
This year, in addition to the rafiki,

62
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,006
there's also a combo you can buy

63
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,763
with a really cute GirlLove pin,

64
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:39,975
because you know I love a cute pin.

65
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:40,996
Number five.

66
00:02:40,996 --> 00:02:43,431
Last year we shipped to just 43 countries.

67
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:47,245
This year, we are
shipping to 223 countries

68
00:02:47,245 --> 00:02:48,257
across the world.

69
00:02:48,257 --> 00:02:52,000
And, shipping prices have
been reduced from 25-75%

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,919
because I know all you
international homies

71
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:55,069
wanna support your girl.

72
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:56,708
And not just your girl, but all the girls.

73
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:57,591
Life hack.

74
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,757
You and your friends can buy
in bulk and pay shipment once,

75
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,071
if you live in the same place.

76
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:03,080
Number six.

77
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,636
The more educated girls
are around the world,

78
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,524
the better the world becomes.

79
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:08,591
And I need to emphasize,

80
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,505
this is not some fairy
tale or my biased opinion,

81
00:03:11,505 --> 00:03:12,813
this is a fact.

82
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:15,556
Higher education for girls
means less teen pregnancies,

83
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:16,865
and less child marriages.

84
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,456
Not to mention that educated women

85
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,259
are less likely to get
diseases like HIV and AIDS.

86
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,130
And the list goes on and on and on and on,

87
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,701
but at a very basic
level I guess you could

88
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,809
just frame it as hey,

89
00:03:25,809 --> 00:03:28,025
doesn't every girl deserve the opportunity

90
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,566
to be the best version of herself?

91
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:30,509
Number seven.

92
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:32,478
You can wear the rafiki like a bracelet,

93
00:03:32,478 --> 00:03:33,501
like a necklace,

94
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,567
like an anklet,

95
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,754
or like this cool thing.

96
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:37,924
I just did it right here. (chuckles)

97
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:41,105
You can get this new rafiki
right now at girllove.com,

98
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:43,745
and this specific campaign
starts now, today,

99
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:47,089
and goes until October 11th,
which is Day of the Girl.

100
00:03:47,089 --> 00:03:49,843
My goal is to send even more
girls to school than last year,

101
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:53,487
sell even more rafikis, and
impact even more stories.

102
00:03:53,487 --> 00:03:55,560
That's literally all I
want for my birthday.

103
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,966
Like, we are so privileged.

104
00:03:56,966 --> 00:04:00,424
I don't need anything else besides knowing

105
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:03,407
we, together, did something

106
00:04:03,407 --> 00:04:05,570
to give a girl the chance to go to school.

107
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,271
What better thing could
I possibly ask for?

108
00:04:08,271 --> 00:04:09,906
If you were gonna do
anything for my birthday,

109
00:04:09,906 --> 00:04:12,605
or forget my birthday,
just because we should.

110
00:04:12,605 --> 00:04:14,895
If you personally can't
afford a rafiki, I get it.

111
00:04:14,895 --> 00:04:16,382
But you know what you could do?

112
00:04:16,382 --> 00:04:18,512
Share this video, spread this message,

113
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:21,782
because maybe someone on
your timeline or on your feed

114
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:24,511
will watch it and maybe
they can buy a rafiki.

115
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:27,434
So please, please spread the message.

116
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,719
Let people know about the rafiki.

117
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:30,679
I've been there, I've
seen with my own eyes

118
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,154
and it does make a difference.

119
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:34,854
And by saying humanity is the
most important team we're on

120
00:04:34,854 --> 00:04:36,535
and we're in this together.

121
00:04:36,535 --> 00:04:39,212
So please, support my new GirlLove rafiki,

122
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,589
and help me spread some GirlLove.

123
00:04:40,589 --> 00:04:42,880
'Til next time, one love Superwoman.

124
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,615
That is a wrap, and zoop.

125
00:04:45,615 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
