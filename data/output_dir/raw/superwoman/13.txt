1
00:00:04,744 --> 00:00:05,577
- Hey Lilly can I bug you?

2
00:00:05,577 --> 00:00:06,410
- Just give me a sec.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,243
- What are you doing?

4
00:00:07,243 --> 00:00:10,420
- There's a hole in my
shirt so I'm just fixing it.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,253
There, problem solved.

6
00:00:13,731 --> 00:00:14,863
- Yeah...

7
00:00:14,863 --> 00:00:16,420
Um, can I borrow you outside real quick?

8
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,466
- Is it urgent?

9
00:00:17,466 --> 00:00:18,832
I was just in the middle
of stalking my ex.

10
00:00:18,832 --> 00:00:21,316
- Not urgent but there's
a sale at Target--

11
00:00:21,316 --> 00:00:22,816
- Huh, I'll drive.

12
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:25,611
- [Friend] That's what I thought.

13
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,444
- Sale!

14
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:29,923
Remind me not to buy those
small bottles of lotion

15
00:00:29,923 --> 00:00:31,394
because I still have so many
left over from that time

16
00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,600
we stayed at the Sheraton.

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,470
What's this?

18
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,820
- Lilly, have a seat.

19
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,653
- Okay.

20
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,471
What's going on guys?

21
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:41,492
I thought we were going to Target.

22
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:42,606
- We're having an intervention.

23
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:44,513
- I drank that hand sanitizer by accident.

24
00:00:44,513 --> 00:00:45,730
- What, no.

25
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:49,908
- And also I was googling
prom pics but I made a type.

26
00:00:49,908 --> 00:00:51,895
So that's why when you walked
in there was porn pics.

27
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,126
- Lilly we're having this
intervention because you're cheap.

28
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:54,959
- What?

29
00:00:56,387 --> 00:00:58,027
I'm not cheap.

30
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:01,615
- As your teammates and your
friends we feel differently.

31
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,824
Derek, would you like to start?

32
00:01:03,824 --> 00:01:05,167
(clears throat)

33
00:01:05,167 --> 00:01:08,215
- Um, this year you had
my name for Secret Santa

34
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:10,566
and all I wanted was a new phone case.

35
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:12,079
- Yeah, and I got you one.

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,579
- You got me this.

37
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,524
- Okay, that is a zip and
lock freezer bag, by the way,

38
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:20,092
so if anything I splurged.

39
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:23,105
- The other day it took me an
hour to make you a milkshake.

40
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,688
(quirky music)

41
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:45,504
- I have to eat my cereal
two cheerios at a time.

42
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:49,919
I mean, a regular size milk
carton is all we're asking for.

43
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,564
- Really?

44
00:01:51,564 --> 00:01:52,766
What's next huh?

45
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,577
We're gonna start buying
bottles of ketchup even though

46
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,171
we have the packets from Mcdonalds?

47
00:01:56,171 --> 00:01:58,326
- Okay, the other day Lilly
took me to Costco for lunch.

48
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,838
- Wait, what's wrong with
buying lunch at Costco?

49
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,640
I actually like their food.

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,164
- She didn't buy it.

51
00:02:04,164 --> 00:02:07,164
- Mm, yup, which one was that again?

52
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,491
- For the third time, sweet chili.

53
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:12,313
- Sweet chili, we'll try one of those.

54
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:16,619
Grab one, grab one, come on, don't be shy.

55
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:17,619
- [Both] Mm.

56
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:19,576
- Oh yeah.

57
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,470
- Let's get going.

58
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,610
- What about that one?

59
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,992
- They're all sweet chili.

60
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,440
- They're all sweet chili.

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,264
Are you sure because I feel
like they're different.

62
00:02:29,264 --> 00:02:31,151
- [Both] Mm, mm hmm.

63
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,042
- Now I see, all sweet chili.

64
00:02:32,042 --> 00:02:33,590
- Are you guys gonna
buy something or what?

65
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,968
- I haven't decided if I like it yet.

66
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:37,615
Maybe one more.

67
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,771
Here you go.
- Okay.

68
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,157
- Just to make sure.
- We're really doing this.

69
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:42,990
- Why not?

70
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,932
- Why are you carrying that?

71
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:48,313
- It's free food.

72
00:02:48,313 --> 00:02:50,124
I'm not trying to be wasteful.

73
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:54,040
- Last week I had a cold and
the Starbucks napkins were

74
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,260
really rough on my nose.

75
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,959
Can't we just get regular tissues?

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,180
- I'm sorry your nose is a Kardashian.

77
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,178
Gosh, this guy.

78
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:05,489
- Last year when I was
booking your world tour,

79
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,012
do you remember what you
said about your flights?

80
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:09,182
- Yeah, I said we should book
one flight from LA to India

81
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:10,948
with a whole bunch of stopovers

82
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:14,511
in different countries but that's smart.

83
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,974
- One time you tried to bargain with

84
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:17,061
a vending machine at the mall.

85
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:19,300
- How do you know if you don't try Paul?

86
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,362
- What about that time we went clubbing?

87
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:25,029
And you made us all go so early.

88
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,738
- But it was ladies free before 11:00.

89
00:03:27,738 --> 00:03:30,738
- Yeah, but you made us go with you.

90
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,375
(club music)

91
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,079
(giggles)

92
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,502
- But did you pay?

93
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:45,109
- Guys were hitting on me.

94
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:48,359
- Why didn't you just take the wig off?

95
00:03:49,971 --> 00:03:52,235
You first interviewed me
you asked me if I wanted a

96
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:53,698
sparkling or still water, remember that?

97
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:54,542
- Yeah I do.

98
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,641
Exactly, it's like a fancy
restaurant in here, options.

99
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:58,992
- Right, I said I wanted
sparkling and you gave me

100
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:00,960
tap water with glitter in it.

101
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,039
- But did it sparkle?

102
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,234
- My poo looked like a
Christmas ornament for weeks.

103
00:04:04,234 --> 00:04:05,894
- That sounds fantastic, you're welcome.

104
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,175
- Listen Lilly, all we're
saying is that maybe

105
00:04:08,175 --> 00:04:10,650
if you weren't so economically cautious,

106
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,398
things would change.

107
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:14,387
Like maybe you wouldn't be single.

108
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,249
- Excuse me?

109
00:04:15,249 --> 00:04:17,257
Okay, I treated my ex
like a king, by the way.

110
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,424
Do you know how many times
I made him classy dinners?

111
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,981
(quirky music)

112
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:34,483
Happy anniversary babe.

113
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,109
Oh, my mistake.

114
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:41,795
There.

115
00:04:42,938 --> 00:04:45,584
Listen guys, I appreciate
the concern but I'm fine.

116
00:04:45,584 --> 00:04:48,439
Trust me, so can we please
just get back to work?

117
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:50,190
- Fine.
- Sure.

118
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,190
- Thank you.

119
00:04:53,596 --> 00:04:55,292
- The Wi-Fi isn't working.

120
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,774
- Can you call the neighbors please?

121
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:00,118
- Yeah, to ask them if theirs is working?

122
00:05:00,118 --> 00:05:03,487
- No, ask them for the
new password, obviously.

123
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,820
Oh so you pay for Wi-Fi now?

124
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:19,097
Me cheap are you kidding me?

125
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,173
Make sure you click my ads,
I want that money though.

126
00:05:21,173 --> 00:05:22,205
Just in case.

127
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:23,733
Make sure you subscribe
because I make videos

128
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,630
every Monday and Thursday.

129
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,805
In fact, here's a sneak
peak of my next one.

130
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,035
How to fix any bad day ever.

131
00:05:28,035 --> 00:05:31,702
One love super woman
that is a rap and zoop.

132
00:05:38,453 --> 00:00:00,000
What the eff?
