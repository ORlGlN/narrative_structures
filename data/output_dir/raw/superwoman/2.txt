"Don't worry kid, you'll grow out of it"

11
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,360
Please know that there's a chance you'll grow into it

00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,400
-"You mix sugar with honey"

20
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,380

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,700

-"Wait, have you tried this new face cream?"

29
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,420
-"It's like an oil free toner"

30
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,040
-"It's a little expensive but it works"

31
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,220
