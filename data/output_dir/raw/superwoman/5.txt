10
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,134
Thank you.

(mellow music)

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,820
None of these cards apply to me.

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,788
- [Ben] Do you find that
cards do not apply to you?

14
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,300
- (sighing) If only there was a company

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,090
that made realistic greetings.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,210
- [Ben] Well, now there's a company

17
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:51,800
that creates realistic greetings.

Our team of writers are

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,550
All right, guys, give me somethin' here.

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,510
- What about, I'm not
really sure if we're dating,

26
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,220
so I bought you this card just in case?

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:13,053
- Love it.

28
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:13,886
- What about, I need you.

29
00:01:13,886 --> 00:01:14,860
- Seems incomplete.

30
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,030
- Because I can't finish
a Chipotle bowl on my own.

31
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,520
- Boom.
- I can continue

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,880
to tolerate you.

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,130
- I really like you, but my mom doesn't.

34
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,990
- My mom really likes you, but I don't.

35
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:25,860
Oh, one more.

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,690
You're pregnant, so
I'll learn to love you.

37
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,850

- We understand that you're average.

39
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,320
Your relationship is average.

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,360
And love is pretty all right sometimes.

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,470
Made with 100% honesty.

42
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,160
- Same.

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,980
- [Ben] Our top sellers include,

44
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,130
"I started dating you
to make my ex jealous,

45
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,200
"and it's been great."

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,570
"I love you, but I still want

47
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,260
"to change a lot of things about you."

48
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,860

you might as well keep it real.

Cut the Crap cards.

54
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,350
Because sometimes roses aren't red,

55
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,960
but they're always too expensive.

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,430
(door slams)

57
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,750

58
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,920
Give it a big thumbs up.

59
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,630
The honesty, though, you know honestly,

60
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,590
do you wanna get your bae

61
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,730
