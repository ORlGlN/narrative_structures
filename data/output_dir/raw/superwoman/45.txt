She say one word that

So, people think she

125
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:58,222
This is why companies stopped

127
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:00,967

00:06:13,178 --> 00:06:16,095

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:18,962
5 million views?

182
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,042
What the bloody hell
wrong with you people?

183
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,756
- I tell you one thing, I like his hair.

184
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:30,003
You know whenever floor dirty,
he can do handstand and mop.

185
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:33,807
- Okay, very nice Lilly, good friends!

186
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,199
Okay, thank you. Cut!

187
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,932
I would rather drink one bottle of Windex

188
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:39,704
than watch this again.

189
00:06:39,704 --> 00:06:41,081
- Wait Shh, Shh. Do you hear that?

00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:42,734
It's the sound of young fandoms coming

191
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,986

192
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,819
Disclaimer! Disclaimer!

193
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,513
Every single person my parents
reacted to in this video

194
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:50,195
gave me permission and
knew I was going to do it.

195
00:06:50,195 --> 00:06:51,410
And I'm friends with most of them

196
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,588
so don't take it so seriously.

197
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:54,971
But you know what you
should take seriously? This!

198
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:57,376
