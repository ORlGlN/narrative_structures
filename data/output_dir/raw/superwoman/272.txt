180
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:24,266
Also along with a whole
bunch of other cool stuff,

181
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,965
like a Flappy Unicorn game,
fan art, and shout outs,

182
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:29,089
for scores, and yada, yada, yada, yada.

183
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:31,608
You should definitely
download the app, though.

184
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:34,082
Other than that, if you liked this video,

185
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:35,161
give it a big thumbs up.

186
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,380
Make sure you com below, letting me know

187
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,366
what else you want my parents to react to.

188
00:06:38,366 --> 00:06:39,422
You can check out my last video.

189
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:40,745
It is about, what is it about again?

190
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,779
Uhh.

191
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:43,601
Right, why phone plans are evil.

192
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:44,901
You can check that out,
if you're on the phone

193
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:45,958
and the animation doesn't work,

194
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,966
I'll put the link in the description.

195
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,998
You can check all my vlogs right
there on my second channel.

196
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:51,228
Make sure you subscribe to that,

197
00:06:51,228 --> 00:06:52,598
because I do that, pretty much,

198
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:53,898
every freaking day.

199
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:54,908
And make sure you subscribe,

200
00:06:54,908 --> 00:06:57,223
because I make new videos
every Monday and Thursday,

201
00:06:57,223 --> 00:06:58,964
and I'd love for you to be there.

202
00:06:58,964 --> 00:07:01,785
One love Superwoman, that is a wrap.

203
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:03,677
And zoo-pah.

204
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:05,500
Look how fancy all this, y'all fancy this?

205
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,857
We steppin on up, up a her.

206
00:07:07,857 --> 00:00:00,000
Why aren't you in the braid?
