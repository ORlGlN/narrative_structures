4
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:11,193
- So, your profile says
you do construction work?

5
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:12,058
- Huh?

6
00:00:12,058 --> 00:00:14,657
- It says you build houses
and buildings and stuff.

7
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:18,574
- Oh, yeah, I build
houses, buildings, castles.

8
00:00:19,706 --> 00:00:20,870
In Minecraft.

9
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:21,703
- In what now?

10
00:00:21,703 --> 00:00:23,772
- (clears throat) It's a sandbox game

11
00:00:23,772 --> 00:00:25,837
in which you collect blocks

12
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:29,420
and then you build
things with said blocks.

13
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:33,617
- Wow, yeah, no, totally cool.

14
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,626
I could see how that would be considered

15
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:37,461
like a real job on a dating profile, yeah.

16
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,060
- I'm also really into being
an automobile thief (chuckles).

17
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,071
- Oh, I get it, like Grand Theft Auto?

18
00:00:43,071 --> 00:00:45,558

19
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:46,993

May I suggest Legend Black?

38
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:33,126
- I don't know what it is
about John Legend's music.

39
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,026
He makes me wanna be in love.

40

I just don't wanna be alone, I guess.
