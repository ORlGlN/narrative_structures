1
00:00:00,632 --> 00:00:02,882
(neighing)

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,040
- I will kill you.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,060
- I told you I didn't do it.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:08,893
- But you're lying.

5
00:00:08,893 --> 00:00:10,300
You were the only one
that was alone that night.

6
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:11,133
- When?

7
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:11,966
- When you went to the washroom.

8
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:14,170
- You think I faked needing to go pee

9
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,800
so I could steal your watch?

10
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,633
- I don't know.

11
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:17,810
I'm just saying when you
came back downstairs,

12
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,080
your bladder didn't look any different.

13
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,402
- What does that even mean?

14
00:00:20,402 --> 00:00:21,235
- Yeah.

15
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,032
And I know you need the extra
cash for Kevin's birthday.

16
00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:23,865
Oh my god, you know what?

17
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:24,860
You probably sold it on Craigslist.

18
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,540
- I'm an engineer, okay?

19
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,910
I don't need extra cash.

20
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,140
Kevin and I broke up.

21
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,860
- Okay, so then you
just want to meet Craig.

22
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,692
Makes sense.

23
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,110
- Hi, Kardashians.

24
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,810
I'm looking for my sane friends.

25
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,643
What the hell is going on?

26
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:40,040
- Lilly's acting crazy and
thinks I stole her watch.

27
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:40,873
- Wait what?

28
00:00:40,873 --> 00:00:43,000
- Okay I don't think, I know.

29
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,980
- Lilly?
- No yeah.

30
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,813
Erica's my best friend.

31
00:00:44,813 --> 00:00:45,646
She knows me.

32
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:49,090
I have expert intuition and
I am 2,000% sure about this.

33
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,160
Erica, tell him.

34
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,400
- You stole my best friend's
watch you piece of trash.

35
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,310
- Tell him.

36
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,540
- Oh my god.

37
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,373
- How did it feel?

38
00:00:59,373 --> 00:01:01,756
Did it feel good wrapped
around your evil wrist?

39
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:02,589
- Oh my god.

40
00:01:02,589 --> 00:01:04,160
Oh my god, do you know what?

41
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,420
I actually even remember you
wearing it the other day.

42
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,180
- I've never even seen your watch, okay?

43
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,150
That's insane.

44
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,010
- I remember it, too.

45
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,910
I remember thinking oh,
Rosco's wearing a watch.

46
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:14,750
Cool.

47
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,290
- Who even wears watches, okay?

48
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,430
I have a cell phone.

49
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,560
- So do I, but I like
the way it makes me feel.

50
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,040
- She likes the way it makes her feel.

51
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,710
- Yeah, sure I couldn't
always tell the time on it

52
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,543
because it didn't have numbers,

53
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,760
it had those fancy little markings.

54
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,190
But still, it made me feel like a lawyer.

55
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,023
- Yeah.

56
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,800
We feel the defendant guilty as charged.

57
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,620
How dare you disrespect my best friend?

58
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,700
Come on, Lilly.

59
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,800
Let's get out of here.

60
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,520
- Mouth breather.

61
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,310
- Dude, you're completely wrong.

62
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,840
You let me borrow your watch last week.

63
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,673
- Damn it.

64
00:01:43,673 --> 00:01:44,506
- It's okay.

65
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:48,990
- Are you having a good day?

66
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,960
I hope you're having a good day.

67
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,260
You know how you can
help me have a good day?

68
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,510

One love Superwoman.

75

That is a wrap.

76
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,563
And zoop.

77
00:02:04,563 --> 00:02:06,037
Yo, give me my watch son.

78
00:02:06,037 --> 00:00:00,000
Back off.
