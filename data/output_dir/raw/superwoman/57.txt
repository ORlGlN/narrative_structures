1
00:00:00,202 --> 00:00:02,065
- I'd like to thank God for Spanx,

2
00:00:02,065 --> 00:00:04,790
screen protectors, and Selena Gomez.

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,623
(horse hooves clopping)

4
00:00:05,623 --> 00:00:08,509
(horse neighs)

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,342
What up, everyone?

6
00:00:09,342 --> 00:00:10,276
It's your girl, Superwoman,

7
00:00:10,276 --> 00:00:13,609
and never before have my
parents reacted to Selena Gomez.

8
00:00:13,609 --> 00:00:14,442
Why?

9
00:00:14,442 --> 00:00:16,514
Because I adore her and
if my parents say anything

10
00:00:16,514 --> 00:00:18,094
to make fun of her, I will die.

11
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,875
Sometimes I wish I could just
like, control what they say.

12
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,611
But because Selena's
new music is so iconic,

13
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,292
I've decided to change my mind.

14
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,858
So please enjoy my parents reacting

15
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:29,747
to Fetish by Selena Gomez.

16
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:32,644
Wuddup, t-shirt reference?

17
00:00:32,644 --> 00:00:33,984
Wuddup, t-shirt reference?

18
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:37,293
It's like, Inception 2
is just writing itself.

19
00:00:37,293 --> 00:00:39,049
Okay, go ahead, go watch the, whoosh!

20
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:39,966
- Hello!

21
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:40,799
- Hello.

22
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:43,551
Munjit Singh, coolest guy on Instant-gram.

23
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:45,318
- Today we're reacting Selena Gomez,

24
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:47,072
never before react because Lilly say

25
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,602
if we say anything bad about her,

26
00:00:48,602 --> 00:00:50,699
she going to run away from home.

27
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:53,021
- You know, I don't really
know Selena Gomez music

28
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,771
because I am man, so.

29
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,528
♫ Keep my hands to myself

30
00:00:57,528 --> 00:01:01,695
♫ I mean I could but why would I want to

31
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:05,725
- You know, wizard girl that
do the magic ding-a-ding?

32
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,290
- Uh, Hermione, from Harry Potter.

33
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,853
- Song name Fe-tash.

34
00:01:08,853 --> 00:01:11,972
- Featuring Gucky Mah, Munny,

35
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:13,555
ba da, Gucky Munny!

36
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,156
- Mmm, nice flower, I
want like that in garden.

37
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:18,847
- Very nice, beautiful, yeah.

38
00:01:18,847 --> 00:01:21,122
Maybe Fetash some nice place in Greece.

39
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:21,955
We should go vacation.

40
00:01:21,955 --> 00:01:23,084
- I like this dress, you see?

41
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,551
No legs showing, very good.

42
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:25,623
- You see car on fire there,

43
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:27,075
Lilly probably driving this one.

44
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,924
You know one time she
tried to parallel park,

45
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:30,515
they had to close the street.

46
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:31,348
- You see, you see?

47
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:32,687
Good girls go grocery shopping.

48
00:01:32,687 --> 00:01:35,288
I'm talking to you, okay,
naked girls on Instant-gram.

49
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:37,003
- Oh, I love hand puppet!

50
00:01:37,003 --> 00:01:38,019
I love, oh, make a doggy!

51
00:01:38,019 --> 00:01:39,283
Make dog, meow meow!

52
00:01:39,283 --> 00:01:40,116
Meow meow meow!

53
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,335
- This like a silent film.

54
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,289
Very pretty girl, you see?

55
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,323
I wish I had daughter like this, you know?

56
00:01:44,323 --> 00:01:45,270
That look like a girl.

57
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,450
Look, such a nice table.

58
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:48,189
She probably making dinner for in-laws.

59
00:01:48,189 --> 00:01:49,131
♫ If I were you I'd

60
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:50,170
♫ Love

61
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:53,419
- Oh, oh, okay, that escalate quickly!

62
00:01:53,419 --> 00:01:56,619
- Oh, oh, okay, maybe this a
new way to defrost a chicken.

63
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,277
- This is not how you take off a stocking!

64
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,760
I mean, not that I wear, I don't know,

65
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,070
but I'm guessing, you know.

66
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,903
(clears throat)

67
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:03,971
she cutting her tongue with a wrench.

68
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,260
- Oy, that a eyelash curler, dumbhead.

69
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,311
- Okay, okay.

70
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,823
She cutting her tongue
with a eyelash curler!

71
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:11,138
- What the bloody hell
this is, her fashion?

72
00:02:11,138 --> 00:02:14,571
♫ Under and twisted up like origami

73
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,107
- Okay, how the bloody
hell it raining inside

74
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,728
and what kind of magic candle this is,

75
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,561
not being effected?

76
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:19,394
Bloody wizard.

77
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:22,113
- This a music video or new
season of American Horror Story?

78
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:24,186
♫ Surprised, I sympathize

79
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,371
- Apparently crazy is the new black.

80
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:27,814
- Okay, you need a plumber!

81
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,508
- Why the bloody hell
she playing Twister, huh?

82
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:31,216
There not even colorful mat on floor.

83
00:02:31,216 --> 00:02:33,594
- Oh, all the eggs broken, oh my God.

84
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:34,987
How you going to make omelet?

85
00:02:34,987 --> 00:02:36,549
- I don't like this dress anymore.

86
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:38,173
- I think she really like this counter.

87
00:02:38,173 --> 00:02:40,035
- This not how you serve dessert, okay?

88
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:40,868
Or is it?

89
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:46,087
♫ I push you out and you come right back

90
00:02:46,087 --> 00:02:47,154
♫ Don't see a point in

91
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:49,000
- Maybe she take Advil PM during the day

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,049
and now she crazy.

93
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:51,853
- Where this water coming from, huh?

94
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,393
Your dinner table in SeaWorld?

95
00:02:53,393 --> 00:02:56,019
- She remind me of this emoji.

96
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:58,069
- This counter getting
more action than Lilly.

97
00:02:58,069 --> 00:02:59,428
- Oy, oy, oy oy, where your hand going?

98
00:02:59,428 --> 00:03:00,261
(stammers)

99
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:01,540
I mean, I'm not looking, I'm just, I just,

100
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,018
I'm just, I'm, okay.

101
00:03:03,018 --> 00:03:04,540
- I like when her hair comb, you know?

102
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,753
She look less crazy.

103
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,106
- Oh, yes, Drake is here.

104
00:03:07,106 --> 00:03:08,827
- Oy, this is not Drake!

105
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:09,660
This Weeknd.

106
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,493
- Huh?

107
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,388
Weekend? Today Monday.

108
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:13,221
- He speaking English?

109
00:03:13,221 --> 00:03:14,560
Sing Star Boy!

110
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,990
- Okay, I understand, she in grocery store

111
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,469
where maybe Elsa do shopping.

112
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,852
You know, grocery store
inside a snow globe.

113
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:21,987
- Why you always on floor, huh?

114
00:03:21,987 --> 00:03:23,073
Somebody buy her bed!

115
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:26,008
♫ Why buy a mattress anywhere else, ding

116
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:28,174
♫ Out and you come right back

117
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:30,817
- Making a snow angel
in freezer, very good.

118
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:32,656
- But she's so pretty, right?

119
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:33,573
Oh.

120
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:34,967
Then she eating lipstick.

121
00:03:34,967 --> 00:03:36,685
- This is not how you do lipstick, okay?

122
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:37,794
I mean, not that, not that I know,

123
00:03:37,794 --> 00:03:39,294
I'm just, uh, I'm just guessing.

124
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:40,924
♫ If I were you I'd do me

125
00:03:40,924 --> 00:03:42,882
- Okay, thank God, do dishes, ah?

126
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:43,781
What the bloody hell?

127
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,439
- Oh, this is not food group, okay?

128
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,126
Vegetable, roti, bread.

129
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:49,145
These food groups!

130
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,016
- No, that's good, no, no!

131
00:03:50,016 --> 00:03:52,188
Let me throw bloody food on ground

132
00:03:52,188 --> 00:03:53,944
and then let me eat soap, huh?

133
00:03:53,944 --> 00:03:54,792
Very good, good.

134
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:55,942
No, no, no, please, please!

135
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:56,920
Good, very good.

136
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,206
Good, good.

137
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,039
Dumbhead.

138
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,254
I could say I understand,
but I would be bad liar.

139
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,457
- Maybe someone know the
meaning of this, but,

140
00:04:05,457 --> 00:04:06,833
♫ It ain't me

141
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,875
♫ Dun-de-dun-dun de-dun-dun-dun.

142
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:09,833
- [Man] Hey, um, Lilly?

143
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,666
- Huh?

144
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:11,499
- [Man] We're back.

145
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,286
- Uh, no, oh, I was just,

146
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:14,684
I was just flo, flossing.

147
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:15,776
(stammers)

148
00:04:15,776 --> 00:04:19,109
Hygiene, my teeth, my hygiene, the mint.

149
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:21,607
But there you have it,

150
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,376
I personally love Selena's new music.

151
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:25,573
I think it is different,
I think it's artistic,

152
00:04:25,573 --> 00:04:27,534
and it is definitely full of moans

153
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,354
that I try to imitate all day long.

154
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,660
♫ And oh, baby

155
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,528
My ear just popped.

156
00:04:31,528 --> 00:04:32,418
If you haven't yet seen it,

157
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:33,781
head on over to the Fetish music video

158
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,336
and show it some love, Team Super,

159
00:04:35,336 --> 00:04:36,169
it is dope!

160
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:37,600
Let them know that Lilly sent you.

161
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,483
You can also download the song,

162
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,949
obviously on iTunes, the
link is in the description,

163
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:45,196
#notanad, I just like supporting
dope people who inspire me.

164
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,130
If you wanna follow my
parents on Instagrams

165
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,270
and the Twitters, you can do that.

166
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,113
All the information is right there

167
00:04:49,113 --> 00:04:51,349
because they're real people

168
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:52,968
who can get real brand deals.

169
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:53,861
What, who said, who?

170
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,778
What? What?

171
00:04:55,787 --> 00:04:56,795
What? Follow them.

Comment down below and let me know

173
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,833
what else would you like
to see my parents react to

174
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,078
and also, don't forget that as
soon as I release this video,

175
00:05:02,078 --> 00:05:03,727
I will be starting Super 60.

176
00:05:03,727 --> 00:05:04,691
What is that, you ask?

177
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:06,750
Well after a video's
released for 60 minutes,

178
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,764
I'll respond to your comments down below

179
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,247
so let's chit-chat.

180
00:05:10,247 --> 00:05:12,433
♫ Oh, baby

181
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:13,737
