1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,550
(sleigh bells ring)

2
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:10,487
(bell rings)

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:11,593
- All right class, welcome.

4
00:00:11,593 --> 00:00:12,888
Why don't we go around the room

5
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,447
and talk a little bit
about why we're all here.

6
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,530
(light upbeat music)

7
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:20,746
Not everybody all at once.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,130
- Hello, my name is Paulo and I am here

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,197
so that I can understand my son.

10
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,582
- Welcome.

11
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:32,952
- Hey, my name is Stanley.

12
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:37,648
I'd like to figure out what
my girlfriend sub-Tweets me.

13
00:00:37,648 --> 00:00:39,652
- Hi, I'm Will.

14
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:40,652
I'm a Libra.

15
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:45,268
West Philadelphia born and raised.

16
00:00:45,268 --> 00:00:46,976
And I'm here to learn how to promote my

17
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,951
new movie, Bright, on the internet.

18
00:00:49,951 --> 00:00:53,046
- I'm Gabby and I'm here for the bingo.

19
00:00:53,046 --> 00:00:54,331
- Okay, all right, listen.

20
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,582
The internet can be a scary place

21
00:00:55,582 --> 00:00:56,875
if you don't know the language, okay?

22
00:00:56,875 --> 00:00:58,759
Make one bad move and that's it.

23
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:01,249
Hashtag your name is over
party trending on Twitter.

24
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,999
Yeah, I've seen it happen before.

25
00:01:05,977 --> 00:01:08,196
So let's start with the basics, okay?

26
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:09,879
Compliments.

27
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:13,369
Will, let's say your daughter
has a new hairstyle, okay?

28
00:01:13,369 --> 00:01:15,970
How do you tell her you like it?

29
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,630
- Something like, "Hey baby girl,

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,213
"love the do, you look pretty."

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,245
- "You look pretty," that's cute.

32
00:01:25,245 --> 00:01:26,181
And then she runs away from home because

33
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:27,828
your words mean nothing.

34
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,375
Okay, wrong, compliments on the internet

35
00:01:29,375 --> 00:01:31,208
need to be aggressive.

36
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:33,679
- Like the insurance company.

37
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:35,644
- Okay, no, that's Progressive.

38
00:01:35,644 --> 00:01:37,534
Aggressive, like, you know, "Girl, wrap

39
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,065
"those braids around my neck and whip

40
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,357
"'em back and forth until I turn

41
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:42,918
"blue enough to be called Papa Smurf."

42
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:45,686
- I'm sorry, so you mean to tell me,

43
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:47,792
so people wouldn't be offended by that.

44
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:52,036
- Lesson two, no on is
offended on the internet.

45
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:54,235
Everyone is offendedt.

46
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:55,068
- Tuh, tuh.

47
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:55,901
- Tuh.

48
00:01:55,901 --> 00:01:56,734
- Tuh, tuh.

49
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,027
- Tuh.

50
00:01:58,027 --> 00:01:59,369
- So everybody spells it wrong.

51
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,443
- They don't spell it wrong,
they spell it with passion.

52
00:02:01,443 --> 00:02:04,419
Adding t to the end of
any word makes it better.

53
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,868
Attacked-t, snatched-t.

54
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:07,847
- Internet-t.

55
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:10,036
- internet already ends
with a t, so you see that?

56
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,690
You can't have the two
t's it doesn't work.

57
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,823
- Oh, I'll have a t.

58
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:17,644
- My girlfriend is always
tweeting about spilling the t.

59
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:19,193
How can I help her be less clumsy?

60
00:02:19,193 --> 00:02:20,480
- Clumsy-t.

61
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,544
- Let's get back on track, I think

62
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:22,731
we're off the rails a little bit.

63
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:24,010
Let's just, eyes up here, eyes up here.

64
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,631
Because there is one major thing

65
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,872
that is offensive on the internet.

66
00:02:27,872 --> 00:02:28,705
A big N-O.

67
00:02:30,546 --> 00:02:33,963
Never, ever, insult the K-pop group, BTS.

68
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:38,245
Or the fandom will drag you.

69
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,277
- Fandom, that's cute.

70
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,097
So what is that, like a couple of people

71
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:46,132
who are part of the same
chat or group or something?

72
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,399
- Let's just say, you'd be
safer in I am Legend sis.

73
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,066
- I'm a man, don't you mean bro?

74
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:55,683
- Sis is gender neutral on the internet.

75
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:56,978
Everyone's a sis, you're a sis.

76
00:02:56,978 --> 00:03:00,272
You're a sis, you're a
sis, everyone's a sis.

77
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:01,272
- All right.

78
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:05,226
- Unless you're hella fine,
in which case you're daddy.

79
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,059
- That's me.

80
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,274
- Also known as zaddy.

81
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:08,999
- Maybe that's me.

82
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,497
You saw me in Men in Black right?

83
00:03:10,497 --> 00:03:12,918
- Unless you're someones idol
because then you're their mom.

84
00:03:12,918 --> 00:03:17,085
- So if I'm a zaddy mom, then
my fandom is full of my sons?

85
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:22,453
- Full of your stans.

86
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,176
A fan is called a stan.

87
00:03:24,176 --> 00:03:25,009
- Present.

88
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,897
- No, no Stanley, we're not
taking attendance right now.

89
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,854
I'm just letting you all
know that a fan is a stan.

90
00:03:29,854 --> 00:03:30,878
- Cat in the Hat.

91
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,781
- No, Paulo we're not
rhyming right now sis.

92
00:03:32,781 --> 00:03:35,070
You get that we're not rhyming, right?

93
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,684
Just a fan is a stan.

94
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,635
- Not rhyming, I am sorry.

95
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,222
- You don't need to be sorry,
I'm just letting you know.

96
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:41,246
- Not sorry?

97
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:42,193
- That's okay.

98
00:03:42,193 --> 00:03:43,026
- No, I am sorry.

99
00:03:43,026 --> 00:03:45,010
- I get it, but you
don't need to be sorry.

100
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,161
- So, no sorry.

101
00:03:46,161 --> 00:03:47,476
- Do you do private classes?

102
00:03:47,476 --> 00:03:49,179
- I no sorry.

103
00:03:49,179 --> 00:03:50,923
- I heard some kids the other day

104
00:03:50,923 --> 00:03:54,558
talking about sliding into the PM's.

105
00:03:54,558 --> 00:03:58,312
So that means like,
coming home late, right?

106
00:03:58,312 --> 00:03:59,149
Something like that?

107
00:03:59,149 --> 00:04:00,071
- PM's?

108
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:03,122
- Well yeah, it's like,
"Yo, I gotta go home.

109
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:06,155
"It's getting late,
sliding into those PM's."

110
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:08,115
- Well, PM's also spells PMS.

111
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:09,502
So we don't wanna slide into that.

112
00:04:09,502 --> 00:04:10,335
(he murmurs)

113
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,927
Sliding into those DM's though, you know.

114
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:13,497
That means direct messaging, someone

115
00:04:13,497 --> 00:04:14,813
trying to get jiggy with it.

116
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:16,372
♪ Na, na, na, na, na, na, na ♪

117
00:04:16,372 --> 00:04:19,677
- Oh, okay, trying to
get textually active.

118
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,510
(she snaps)

119
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,343
- Bingo!

120
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:22,593
- Gosh darn it.

121
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:25,075
- Any questions?

122
00:04:25,075 --> 00:04:29,836
- Yeah, why is there a person
holding a camera on my face?

123
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:31,023
- Oh, just ignore that.

124
00:04:31,023 --> 00:04:32,597
Just shooting a little behind
the scenes for my channel.

125
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,086
He's my BTS guy.

126
00:04:34,086 --> 00:04:35,919
- BTS videos are lame.

127
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,951
(room shakes and rumbles)

128
00:04:39,951 --> 00:04:41,598
- What have you done?

129
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:43,181
- [Group] Ahhhhhhh!

130
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:45,764
- Drag him.

131
00:04:45,764 --> 00:04:46,749
- He's canceled.

132
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:50,261
- [Group] World star,
world star, world star!

133
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:51,344
- World star!

134
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,786
- Hashtag Stanley is over
party trending on Twitter.

135
00:04:54,786 --> 00:04:55,913
That was quick.

136
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:57,141
- Should we help him?

137
00:04:57,141 --> 00:04:58,603
- Nah, he'll be fine.

138
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,781
The internet has an
hour of like, 96 hours.

139
00:05:00,781 --> 00:05:01,618
Remember coney?

140
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:02,451
- What?

141
00:05:02,451 --> 00:05:03,284
- Exactly, one more thing.

142
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,613
If you look good, you're a snack.

143
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,144
If you're like a couple, you ship them

144
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:07,761
and they're your OTP.

145
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:08,594
If you're sassy, you're a sav-id.

146
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:09,921
That usually leaves people a little shook.

147
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,884
Especially if you serve
that t in small dose,

148
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:12,717
you know what I mean?

149
00:05:12,717 --> 00:05:13,826
Sprinkle it just a little,
like salt bae, like?

150
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:15,993
- Okay, a little salt bae.

151
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,638
How can I promote my movie?

152
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:22,888
- Well, what does the word Bright mean?

153
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,637
- Not dark.

154
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,696
- I guess you could say, it's lit.

155
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:31,572
- Ahhhhh!

156
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:34,090
(upbeat music)

157
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,507
- Lit-t, with a t at the end.

158
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,545
- Because it has two t's.

159
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:42,378
- He don't get it.

160
00:05:42,378 --> 00:05:43,898
- It doesn't work, it's already a t.

161
00:05:43,898 --> 00:05:45,847
- Not paying attention.

162
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,329
- Snap, crackle, pop!

163
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:48,233
Look who I shot a video with!

164
00:05:48,233 --> 00:05:49,285
- Will Smith.

165
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,093
- God damn, check out his new
movie, Bright, on Netflix.

166
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,549
Right now, information in the description

167
00:05:52,549 --> 00:05:54,636
as well as his new YouTube channel.

168
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:55,469
So check that out.

169
00:05:55,469 --> 00:05:57,076
Last collab over there,
second blog channel.

170
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:58,226
Make sure you subscribe because I make

171
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,566
new videos every Monday and Thursday.

172
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,716
One love, zoop!

173
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:01,975
That is a wrap and zoop!

174
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,359
You the man though.

175
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,192
- Hmmmmm.

176
00:06:04,192 --> 00:00:00,000
- Okay.
