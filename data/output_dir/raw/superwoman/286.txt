It's your girl Superwoman.

00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:20,491
As you can see, I've got my channel back,

14
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:22,019
which means I apologized to my mom

15
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,385
and she said that I have
to apologize publicly

16
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,789
on video as my first video.

17
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,057
So I decided to do that.

18
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:30,272
In fact, I wanted to
apologize to you so much

19
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:34,620
that I got you a cake, because
you told me to take it easy.

20
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:40,552
So, this is my official apology to you.

21
00:00:40,552 --> 00:00:41,853
And I even wrote you a song about it.

22
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:44,853
So, I hope you can forgive me Paramjeet.

♫ She states I'll never find
a boy, I dress like a man

30
00:01:10,472 --> 00:01:11,779
