1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:04,778
(shimmering sound and horse whinnying)

2
00:00:04,778 --> 00:00:06,710
- Okay mom, I'll see you next week.

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,860
- Oi, Lily.

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,490
What happened to your neck, huh?

5
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:14,490
(ominous music)

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,900
- [Lilly Voiceover] Uh, say you fell.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,943
No, wait, but then she'll say-

8
00:00:16,943 --> 00:00:19,170
- How'd you fall on your neck?

9
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,830
- [Lilly Voiceover] Exactly, you moron.

10
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,663
Say it's a rash.

11
00:00:21,663 --> 00:00:22,605
Actually, no, wait.

12
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:23,438
'Cause then she'll say.

13
00:00:23,438 --> 00:00:25,145
- Hmm, okay.

14
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,680
Let's go to doctor.

15
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,513
- [Lilly Voiceover] And
you won't be able to

16
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:28,346
lie to the doctor.

17
00:00:28,346 --> 00:00:29,740
He went to school and stuff.

18
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:30,890
- Hello, Lilly.

19
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,670
I said what happened to your neck, huh?

20
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,610
- [Lilly Voiceover] Quick,
hurry, think of something.

21
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,557
Okay, uh, you got shot.

22
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:36,170
Uh, it's a new tattoo.

23
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,830
You're an aspiring dalmatian.

24
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,450
- Uh, I burnt myself with the curler.

25
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,493
- Okay.

26
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:52,510
Be careful next time.

27
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,043
- Okay.

28
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,440
Uh, I want, like, four bowls of edamame.

29
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,340
I'm so hungry.

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,750
- Is that a hickey?

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,325
- Did you hook up with Bryan again?

32
00:01:05,325 --> 00:01:07,990
- No, I, uh, I burnt
myself with the curler.

33
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,884
- Oh, that's the worst.

34
00:01:08,884 --> 00:01:10,249
- Yeah, hate when that happens.

35
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:11,486
(cell phone ringing)

36
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:12,591
- [Lilly] Right?

37
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:15,240
So painful, the worst.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,300
Okay, before you ask, I burnt
myself with a curler, okay?

39
00:01:23,387 --> 00:01:26,018
- [Friend] What happened to your chest?

40
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:27,920
- Oh, I dropped the curler

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,460
and I burnt myself.

42
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,060
On my boobs.

43
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:31,893
- [Friend] Ouch.

44
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:37,170
(phones ringing and office chatter)

45
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,110
- Is that lingerie in your bag?

46
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,980
- Oh, no.

47
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,900
You know what happened?

48
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,400
I, um, burnt myself with a curler

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,373
and then I used lace to wrap my hand.

50
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:46,043
- Ugh, that's so annoying.

51
00:01:46,043 --> 00:01:47,190
- Oh, it's terrible.

52
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:52,617
(slurping)

53
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:53,450
(sighing)

54
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,583
I keep waking up sick every
morning and throwing up.

55
00:01:54,583 --> 00:01:56,476
I have no idea why.

56
00:01:56,476 --> 00:01:58,410
I mean, three weeks ago, I did

57
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,350
burn myself with a curler, but...

58
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,700
Hello?

59
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,050
Hi, yeah, I'm not gonna be able
to make it into work today.

60
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,610
Yeah, I burnt myself with a curler.

61
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,821
It's been really painful ever since.

62
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:10,741
(sizzling)

63
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,574
Mother Fu-

64
00:02:11,574 --> 00:02:13,513
(booming bass)

65
00:02:13,513 --> 00:02:15,043
(playful music)

66
00:02:15,043 --> 00:02:15,876
- Is that a hickey?

67
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:17,445
- Did you (beep) Bryan again?

68
00:02:17,445 --> 00:02:19,180
(laughing)

69
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,763
- This is 14, take-

70
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,456
This is Scene 4, Take 1.

71
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,460
- You're drunk, go home.

72
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:28,930
Mother Fucker!

73
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:32,631
- End, take 1.

74
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,464
(snap)

75
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:35,623
(beep)

76
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:38,128
- You thought for a
second you hit me, right?

77
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:40,390
(laughing)

78
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:42,400
Taylor's heart was like

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,880
I'm an actor.

80
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,713
An actor.

81
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,180
I'm sorry this videos so short.

82
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,660
You know what had happened
was, I had burnt myself

83
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,010
with a curler. (laughing)

84
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,138
If you liked this video,
if you can relate to it,

85
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,670
give it a big thumbs up.

86
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,150
Check out my last video right over there.

87
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,570

88
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,809

89
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:58,750

91
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,160
One love Superwoman.

92
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,260
That is a wrap.

93
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,300
And zoop.

94
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,133
Straight up, for everything,

95
00:03:05,133 --> 00:00:00,000
"burnt myself with a curler."
