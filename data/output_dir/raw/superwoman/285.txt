Okay, JK, you actually

If that's what you want, I'm

15
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:29,981
Easy peasy lemon squeezy.

16
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,976
So without further adieu,
welcome to my parents reacting to

17
00:00:32,976 --> 00:00:36,041
One Direction's new music
video, "Drag Me Down."

18
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,202
Let's go!

19
00:00:37,202 --> 00:00:37,852
- Hello.

20
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:38,548
- Hello.

21
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:39,152
- Hello.

22
00:00:39,152 --> 00:00:43,006
- (foreign language)

23
00:00:43,006 --> 00:00:43,703
- Reaction.

24
00:00:43,703 --> 00:00:44,934
- Today, I am going to react.

25
00:00:44,934 --> 00:00:48,416
- Ok, today we are doing One
Direction "Drag Me Down."

26
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:50,529
- You know, I get it, don't,
wait, one second, one second,

27
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:54,477
ok, I know, I know, one member
of this team, they leave.

28
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:55,475
Ok, you know what happened?

29
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:56,984
I know this One Direction very well, ok,

30
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:59,422
because they call me on mobile.

31
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,557
They say, "Hello, when our brown man left,

32
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:04,925
"We need another sexy brown man."

33
00:01:04,925 --> 00:01:06,968
They say they need a
sexy (foreign language).

34
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:09,290
I say, "No, no thank you,
I am not One Direction.

35
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,544
"I am solo actor."

36
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:12,332
- I heard a lot about
this One Direction, yes.

37
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,840
I wish Lilly's room was One Direction.

38
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,697
- That's why they make the
song, they really mad at me.

39
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:18,160
They thinking I'm trying
to drag them down.

40
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,319
No, my friends, no, I still support, ok?

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,082
- But Lilly's room look like
a map that was set on fire.

42
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,661
(mouth trill)

43
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,544
Forty direction!

44
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,749
- You are just Michelle, ok?

45
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:29,978
You can leave, ok?

46
00:01:29,978 --> 00:01:31,209
I am Beyonce.

47
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:33,206
- I never hear any One Direction song,

48
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,087
but I know girls going very crazy.

49
00:01:35,087 --> 00:01:37,130
"Ooh, One Direction, One Direction!"

50
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,987
Let me check, is it the right direction?

51
00:01:38,987 --> 00:01:39,800
Hm?

52
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,585
- I think this video...
About weight loss, ok?

53
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:45,837
They thinking maybe I eat
too much Burger King, ok?

54
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:47,787
Now, look at me, oh, dragging me down

55
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:51,131
to the French fry over here,
want a Big Mac over here,

56
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:54,707
Big Mac for brother, hey.

57
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:55,659
- Ok.

58
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:56,634
- Naysa.

59
00:01:56,634 --> 00:01:57,493

60
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,303
- Ok, ok, they in jail,
see, orange outfit, jail.

61
00:02:00,303 --> 00:02:02,415
- Lilly, you say this boy band!

62
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:04,227
- I never seen hair this long.

00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:05,178

64
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:06,734

65
00:02:06,734 --> 00:02:08,638

00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,612
- Oh, this one is a cute

67
00:02:10,612 --> 00:02:13,073
- Look at me, I am so
cool guy, look at me.

68
00:02:13,073 --> 00:02:17,345
- Oh my, I understand, Godzilla coming.

69
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,597
- Ok, really handsome guy, huh?

70
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,221
- He looking very serious, oh, my life.

71
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,452
- I think he bad guy.

72
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:27,120

Whatever, R2DQ, whatever, this one.

00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,826
- Ok, camera moving, very nice.

77
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:38,800
Oh, you forget to button shirt, huh?

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,123
Let me tell your mother, huh?

79
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:43,281

80
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,395
- It's hurting my head.

81
00:02:44,395 --> 00:02:46,833
- Terminator R2DQ.

82
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,807

83
00:02:48,807 --> 00:02:50,525

Ready, ok, now they walk in, Oompa Loompa,

00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,237

00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,262

00:03:24,262 --> 00:03:27,211
- Ok, all the moving,

96
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:28,976
Get one tripod, please.

00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:34,409
(singing in falsetto)

100
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:35,408
You see?

101
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:39,773
Michael Jack- (singing in falsetto)

102
00:03:39,773 --> 00:03:42,280
- Ariana Grande, this Ariana Grande.

103
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,583
(singing very high)

104
00:03:47,063 --> 00:03:47,556
Ok.

105
00:03:47,556 --> 00:03:48,926
- I don't know what this video about.

106
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:50,133
- I don't know what the
bloody hell I've been hearing.

107
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:54,429
- I think this video about global warming.

108
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:57,749
- I like this video
because no boy and no girl

109
00:03:57,749 --> 00:04:00,141
in same scene, except
that one Ariana Grande.

110
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:03,438
- This video look like
my Windows 95 wallpaper.

111
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:04,877
- This kind of video good, ok?

112
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,058
No drinking, no drugs, ok, no bum bum,

113
00:04:08,058 --> 00:04:09,289
no this one.

114
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:12,354
- I think I need to make video,
if I was in One Direction,

115
00:04:12,354 --> 00:04:15,442
ok, because if I was in One Direction,

116
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,253
the direction would be better, we would

117
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:19,784
get to destination faster, ok, right now,

118
00:04:19,784 --> 00:04:22,779
the direction, they getting
lost, they taking wrong way,

119
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:24,938
they on one direction, and chip is saying,

120
00:04:24,938 --> 00:04:27,005
"Make a (foreign
language," you understand?

121
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,280
- No twerking, just working.

122
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,486
- ♫ All my life ♫

123
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,762
Yo, yo, what do Team
Super and One Direction's

124
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:36,060
new music video have in common, huh?

125
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,662
They're both out of this world.

126
00:04:37,662 --> 00:04:38,986
(grunts)

127
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,193
I hope you enjoyed that
video, and if you did,

128
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,074
give it a big thumbs up,
make sure you comment below,

129
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:43,560

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,812
parents to react to, and
I'll try to make it happen.

131
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:47,995
You can also check out my
last video right there.

132
00:04:47,995 --> 00:04:52,035
It is the response diss track
to my mom's diss track to me.

133
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:54,148
If you can't click it because
the adaptations don't work

134
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:56,145
on your phone, I got
you, I'll put the link

135
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:57,468
in the description as well.

136
00:04:57,468 --> 00:04:59,256
Also check out my blogs over there.

137
00:04:59,256 --> 00:05:01,439
My blog channel has reached
900,000 subscribers,

138
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,482
we're so close to one million,
so if you haven't subscribed

139
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:05,618
yet, go over there and check
it out, because I do some

140
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:08,079
pretty cool stuff, if I may say so myself.

141
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,890
Also, make sure you
subscribe, because I do...

142
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:11,771
(mangled words)

143
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,067
I do make new videos
every Monday and Thursday,

144
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,899
and I would love if you
included me in your day,

145
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:20,501
so we can spend some
quality time together.

146
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:23,636
But most importantly, I hope
you had a wonderful, inspiring,

147
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:27,305
positive day, and that you're
smiling, genuinely smiling.

148
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:28,094
(kiss)

149
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,928
Until next time, my love,
one love, Superwoman,

150
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,879
that is a wrap, end zoop...

151
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,177
Ok, I'm doing this because I want to see

152
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:36,267
my dark armpit, but I'll
see, zoop, it's dark!

153
00:05:36,267 --> 00:00:00,000
There you go, epic.
