00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,230
good morning Hank<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Tuesday so for</font>

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few months I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been working</font>

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,959
out a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> times a week</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a trainer</font>

4
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:05,899
named<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn and he has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changed my life</font>

5
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">considerably like I can now run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 miles</font>

6
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,650
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> under an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hour although all things</font>

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,120
being equal I would still prefer not to

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,280
also not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to brag I can now benchpress</font>

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,100
100 pounds 15 times in a row which I

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,240
believe according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the law of</font>

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">transitive benching means that I can</font>

12
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,560
benchpress<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1500 pounds one time in a row</font>

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,939
anyway I bring this up to explain why

14
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,140
I've been listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the Drake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> song</font>

15
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">started from the bottom now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we hear a</font>

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,369
lot recently it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an excellent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> song to</font>

17
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:30,779
run to Hank I'm not sure you're familiar

18
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,969
with this song fortunately 90% of its

19
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,649
lyrics are in its title<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically</font>

20
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,210
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how drake started from the bottom</font>

21
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,090
and then he and his<font color="#E5E5E5"> crew are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now at the</font>

22
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">top meanwhile</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have also been rereading</font>

23
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the autobiography of Benjamin Franklin</font>

24
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Benjamin Franklin was a founding father</font>

25
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,899
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> United States and he invented the</font>

lightning rod and<font color="#E5E5E5"> five focal x' and</font>

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
started universities and fire

28
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,399
departments<font color="#E5E5E5"> and libraries he was a very</font>

29
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,050
interesting guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then recently it</font>

30
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,039
occurred to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me not to sound</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">compliment professor anything that</font>

32
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,340
Benjamin Franklin's autobiography<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:00,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">we here are really interesting and</font>

35
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,550
problematic<font color="#CCCCCC"> to consider together stay</font>

36
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,780
with me first there are the superficial

37
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,519
connections<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're both successful</font>

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,920
people's narratives<font color="#CCCCCC"> about success like</font>

39
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,479
Benjamin Franklin negotiated important

40
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:11,400
treaties with the French<font color="#E5E5E5"> Drake says that</font>

41
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,659
there really ain't<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> popping off in</font>

42
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the music industry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without him also both</font>

43
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,680
narratives are just a smidge<font color="#E5E5E5"> repetitive</font>

44
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,210
like the titular<font color="#E5E5E5"> course of the Drake</font>

45
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">song appears like 35 times in three</font>

46
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:20,970
minutes

47
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,290
and Benjamin<font color="#CCCCCC"> Franklin while he was a</font>

48
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,640
very talented guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

49
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">uses a lot of words most notably</font>

50
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,540
ingenious I mean if you could read

51
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,250
Benjamin Franklin<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks you're</font>

52
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">ingenious but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are also much deeper</font>

53
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">connections so the most famous moment of</font>

54
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,110
Benjamin Franklin's autobiography is

55
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,159
when he is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kicked out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the copper shilling on three loaves of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">who are less fortunate than he and then</font>

fortified only by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> single loaf of</font>
