00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Good morning Hank! It"s Tuesday (evil baby Genghis Khan)

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,500
So last night, long time nerdfighter roxinpunch posted this to her Tumblr:

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,860
I keep looking through college degrees and the jobs you could land with them

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,940
and I just keep going back to how overpriced it all is.

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,800
Is it even worth it?

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,780
That's a really interesting question, not just to prospective college students,

7
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,960
but also to people in their mid 30's still paying off their college loans, so let's examine it.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,740
Now of course most people outside of the United States

9
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,540
will be like, "Of course university is worth it."

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,880
"University is free," or, at least, very inexpensive.

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,380
We also have subsidized education here in the United States,

12
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,260
but it's much less subsidized

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,380
so here, if you live in Indiana for instance

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,380
Indiana University costs about ten thousand dollars

15
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:36,440
if you don't live in Indiana it costs about thirty thousand a year

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,220
So is it worth it?

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,220
Well let's say you spend a hundred thousand dollars on college

18
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,600
including like, sixty thousand in student loans

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,880
With interest you're going to pay about eighty thousand total on those loans

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,600
So your total college cost will be one hundred and twenty thousand dollars

21
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Expect you will also have spent a lot of time

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,320
writing papers, and attending classes,

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,000
and going to supposedly epic frat parties

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,860
that are never actually very fun

25
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,240
because even as you're dancing and drinking and talking to vaguely attractive strangers

26
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:02,580
there's this omnipresent, gnawing feeling in your gut

27
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,580
that nothing means anything

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:07,540
and you feel this endless existential isolation

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,340
Was that just me?

30
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,080
Right, so anyway, you're doing all of that when you might be working

31
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,400
That's called "opportunity cost"

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,820
On the other hand, the eighty thousand dollars that you spend

33
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,420
will actually be slightly less than eighty thousand dollars would've been because of inflation

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,680
I'm gonna ballpark here and just say that your college cost is like $140,000 in this example

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,260
But then you have 50ish years of labor-forced drudgery to look forward to

36
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,100
Now again we have to deal with inflation and stuff,

37
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,720
but let's just say that if you make $175,000 more than you would've made,

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,500
then college was "worth it."

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,800
So how much in per hour earnings over your career does a college degree have to generate

40
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,160
in order to be worth it?

41
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,980
About $1.75

42
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,860
So over the course of your career, if you make $13 an hour on average

43
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,260
when you would've otherwise made $11.25

44
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,080
college has paid for itself

45
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,860
And so most studies show that on average college is still very much worth it

46
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,660
Although I should note that there are some for-profit universities and misleading vocational training programs

47
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,200
that probably aren't worth it

48
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,620
But assuming you go to a reasonably good, accredited university

49
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,980
there are two things that are true:

50
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,940
One- it is criminally overpriced

51
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,520
Two- it is probably still worth it

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,240
But Hank, my problem is that calculation assumes that human life

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,200
is a purely economic phenomenon, which it isn't

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Let me give you an example

55
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,840
As you know, Hank, a long time ago I worked the graveyard shift at Steak and Shake,

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,340
and I made about $14 an hour on average

57
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,300
It was a great job with good benefits,

58
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,920
there was even a stock buying program which is why I still own 15 shares of Steak and Shake stock

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,220
But about once a week at 3 or 3:30 in the morning

60
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,720
I'd walk into the bathroom and even though the toilet was fully functional,

61
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,280
I'd notice that there was vomit in the urinal.

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,100
Now Hank, I don't know if you've ever cleaned a stranger's vomit out of a urinal

63
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,740
but let me assure you that the most intense games of rock-paper-scissors I will ever play

64
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,080
were played to decide who was gonna be on vomit-urinal duty.

65
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,220
After graduating from college, I actually made $1 per hour less

66
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,580
when I started working as an assistant at Booklist Magazine,

67
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,360
but the job was better in every way.

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,260
I was surrounded by books and people who loved them

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,880
I had opportunities for advancement,

70
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,820
and in 6 years of working there I never once saw vomit in the urinal!

71
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,120
Hank, it's been my experience that maximizing income is a hell of a lot less important

72
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,320
than maximizing passion and fulfillment in your life

73
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,180
both professionally and personally

74
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,200
When I was in college, I remember fearing that the dreary grind of adulthood

75
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,320
would feature, like, infinitely more existential dread than frat parties had,

76
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,400
but the opposite has been true for me.

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,780
I'm much less likely to feel that gnawing fear of aimlessness and nihilism than I used to be,

78
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,340
and that's partly because education gave me job opportunities

79
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,620
But it's mostly because education gave me perspective and context

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,880
Whether you're studying electrical engineering or poetry, college is not finally about maximizing income

81
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,280
It's about becoming a better, and more informed observer of the universe,

82
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,980
And for me, at least, that's what leads to a more fulfilling life.

83
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,720
Hank, in a world where about half of humans live on less than $2.50 a day

84
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,900
the opportunity to learn and study in a formal, dedicated way is still a gift,

85
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,240
even if it has become a very expensive one.

86
00:03:50,480 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on Friday.
