Good morning John! Thank you for your thoughtful and intelligent discussion of advertisements on Monday.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:08,120
But now for something completely different...

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,880
[acoustic guitar]

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,840
[singing] Now and then I see you in my rearview mirror

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,160
as I drive by on my way to the grocery store

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:31,880
Your sandwich artists always seem quite kind, but your bread is crumbling all the time

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,280
it's been a while, I think I owe you an explanation

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,100
See, you can get addicted to a certain kind of sandwich

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:52,420
this recognition that a sub is not just a sub.

10
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,040
So when I found that their delivery was so fast it almost frightened me

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,940
Well I'll admit that I was glad to stop eating Subway.

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:13,320
So now I order Jimmy Johns. Their website stores my favourites and my credit card number

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:20,280
Sometimes you just need a sub, but I just cannot be bothered to care where it comes from

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,520
And it's true that they don't toast their subs, but if I wanted toasted then I'd go to Quizno's.

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,140
I prefer an un-wich though, so now you're just a Subway where I used to go.

16
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,940
The Subway... *whispers "where I used to go"*

17
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,920
The Subwayyyyyy....

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,540
The Subway... *whispers "where I used to go"*

19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,280
The Subwayyyy...

20
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,980
Probably a lot of people in the comments right now are wondering "How much did Jimmy Johns pay me to make that video?"

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:58,880
and the answer is "No", no dollars at all were exchanged, I just saw this picture on Tumblr.

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,120
But although that song was not an advertisement, that thing over there is.

23
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,400
The American eyeball, or generally the affluent eyeball

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,740
(and yes you are affluent if you have an internet connection fast enough to watch YouTube Videos)

25
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:13,700
is one of the most valuable commodities in existence on earth right now.

26
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:21,100
So valuable, in fact, that many amazing services can be offered for free in exchange for nothing more than those eyeballs.

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,760
I don't like advertisements! Sorry to people in the advertising business

28
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,960
but I've seen too many Geico commercials that don't say anything about anything

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,840
to feel like you're not, like, wheedling around in my brain and making me do things I don't even know I'm doing.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,320
But the internet is built on the idea that this stuff should be free, so that's problematic

31
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,140
because advertising is then the only model.

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,500
And if you want YouTube to be free and yet continue employing thousands of people

33
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,420
you're gonna have to look at ads.

34
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:50,720
But if you don't want YouTube videos to be supported by ads and you don't want them to be free then we should talk about that.

35
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:59,840
If there's a way to make an online company that doesn't rely on users providing their psyche and their behavioural habits to be put into a collective commons

36
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,940
that is then auctioned off literally to the highest bidder, let's have that conversation.

37
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,120
John, I'll see you tomorrow.

38
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,380
And I bought three subs to make that music video.

39
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:16,020
I just felt weird about going into the places and not buying subs if we were going to film, so now I have three submarine sandwiches.

40
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,340
[car revving in distance]

41
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,380
Shut up

42
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,000
This is a hot fish.

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:30,940
It's a hot fish, man. This is a hot fish. *Michael laughs* This is a hot fish. It's a hot, hot...ow.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:00:00,000
Whoo! It's a hot fish. Ok. I'm gonna be ok. *nervous laughter* Hot fish.
