00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,980
Good morning, Hank. It's Tuesday. I have a
flu-like illness, so you should prepare yourself

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:07,890
for the worst vlogbrothers video ever. To
make it slightly more entertaining, I'm gonna

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,419
play some Project for Awesome livestream highlights,
so you don't have to look at my sick mug.

4
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,909
So, Hank, this whole thing started while Henry
was giving me Sharpie face on Saturday morning

5
00:00:15,909 --> 00:00:18,970
during the Project for Awesome, and I felt
a little tickle in my throat. I thought it

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,080
was Sharpie fumes, and, you know, maybe it
was, maybe Sharpies caused my illness. But,

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,140
at any rate, yeah, now I'm miserably ill,
which sucks, because there are only a few

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,669
days left in the Paper Towns shoot, and I
wanna be with those people because awesome

9
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:34,540
things are happening today in a minivan. But
I also don't wanna get them sick because they

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,520
still have to finish the movie.
More importantly, the Project for Awesome

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,290
has raised over $1.2 million for charity,
by far the most successful P4A of all time.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,120
Nerdfighters, thanks to all of you who donated,
who made P4A videos, who watched them, and

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,290
shared them, and commented, and watched the
live show. I don't know what you guys thought

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,880
of this year's Project for Awesome -- I'm
interested to hear in comments, but for me

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,810
it was definitely the best one yet, at least
until I was stuck by this terrible Sharpie

16
00:00:58,810 --> 00:00:59,240
illness.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,490
John-from-livestream: Cover it with Sharpie,
yes!

18
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,210
Henry-from-livestream: No, I don't wanna cover
it.

19
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:03,330
John-from-livestream: Oh, you don't wanna
cover it.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,800
Henry-from-livestream: If you cover it guess
what.

21
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:12,330
John-from-livestream: What?
Henry-from-livestream: You like... get forehead

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,120
disease.

23
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:17,290
Oh, Henry you were so right to be worried
about forehead diseases, which reminds me

24
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,900
to thank my family for their patience and
participation in this year's Project for Awesome,

25
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,970
not least Sarah, who allowed herself to be
covered in jelly. And I should also mention

26
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,760
that the Indiegogo is still live. You can
donate for the rest of today and today only,

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,479
to get amazing perks, from a calendar featuring
YouTubers before they were YouTubers, to the

28
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,930
Project for Awesome exclusive edition of The
Fault in Our Stars. There's also original

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,450
art by Minute Physics, An Imperial Affliction,
P4A socks, pressed pennies, and so much more.

30
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:45,850
Donations are tax-deductible in the US, and
all of your money after manufacturing costs

31
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,970
and shipping goes to charities that are chosen
by the Nerdfighter community at projectforawesome.com.

32
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,770
Ah, man, this reminds me of when #bananaeyes
trended on Twitter. Happier days, Hank, happier

33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,390
days.

34
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,780
Sarah-from-livestream: Yay!
John-from-livestream: You look adorable. How

35
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,229
do I look?
Sarah-from-livestream: It's gross.

36
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:08,869
So Hank, the Foundation to Decrease Worldsuck
works because there's no overhead. Everyone

37
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,319
who packs and ships perks at the DFTBA Records
Warehouse volunteers their time, as does Sam

38
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,719
Rudge, who does the website work, Karen Kavett,
who designs it, Lauren Chernikoff, and dozens

39
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,540
of other people. So to everyone who was part
of this year's Project for Awesome, thank

40
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,540
you, thank you. We did it! $1 million! Actually
like 200,000 more than a million. Hank, here's

41
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,400
a sentence I thought I would never say: you
are the most beautiful mummy dancer the world

42
00:02:33,400 --> 00:00:00,000
has ever known. I'll see you on Friday.
