00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,870
Hank: Hello and welcome to a special episode
of A Brief History, a show created by Ryder

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,570
Burgin that usually runs on YouTube.com/footofaferret,
but just for today it runs here on Vlogbrothers,

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:08,440
part of the collaboration between Hank and
Ryder.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,180
Today's episode: Homestar Runner.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,180
Ready?

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,180
Set?

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
Go!

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,180
Ryder: Atlanta, Georgia, 1996.

9
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,460
University of Georgia students Mike Chapman
and Craig Sobul had a day off from their summer

10
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,699
jobs and decided to go to a bookstore where
they discovered just how bad children's books

11
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:22,310
at that time were, and decided to just go
home and write their own.

12
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,210
Titled The Homestar Runner Enters the Strongest
Man in the World Contest, this book was a

13
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,419
quasi-parody of children's books, featuring
an arm-less athlete named Homestar Runner,

14
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,269
a wrestle-man named Strong Bad and a small
mischievous animal called The Cheat.

15
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:34,110
Hank: Over the next few years, Mike and his
brother Matt began working in graphic design,

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,360
while also teaching themselves Flash animation,
which allowed for animated content to beam

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,950
over the Internet back when speeds were embarrassingly
slow.

18
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,530
In late 1999, the brothers Chaps launched
a website at homestarrunner.com where they

19
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,690
would upload their Flash animation, with Mike
tackling most of the site's graphic design

20
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,340
and Matt voicing the majority of the characters.

21
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,090
Ryder: At the time of its launch, the site
featured a couple of interactive menu screens,

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,850
a few cartoons, and a handful of games.

23
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,390
These early cartoons had a very simple, children's-book
style, similar to that of the original Homestar

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,390
book.

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,570
These cartoons also introduced a new set of
characters who would soon become regulars

26
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,120
to the homestar on the show, such as Marzipan,
voiced by Missy Palmer, Strong Matt, Strong

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,509
Sad, Bubs, Coach Z, the King of Town, and
the Poopsmith.

28
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,650
Just... don't ask.

29
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:09,880
The brothers continued to sporadically update
the site with new cartoons and games whenever

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,720
they could find the time to make them, but
after a couple of years and a sleek new re-design

31
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,020
the Homestar Runner site really began to take
off, with the launch of the site's first recurring

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,170
series, Strong Bad Email.

33
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:18,729
Hank: The concept of the show was beautiful.

34
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,549
Take the biggest jerk of the site, give him
fan mail, and watch the fireworks.

35
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,079
With its consistent release schedule, unique
sense of humor, and use of fan interaction,

36
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:29,119
the sbemails were almost an instant success,
spawning spin-off shows, including Teen Girls

37
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,889
Squad and of course everyone's favorite one-armed
wing-a-ling dragon turned meme, Trogdor the

38
00:01:33,889 --> 00:01:34,889
Burninator.

39
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,799
Ryder: The Strong Bad emails massively boosted
homestarrunner.com's traffic.

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,799
How much?

41
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,799
No one knows.

42
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:42,350
The Brothers Chaps as they became known, never
installed an analytics package onto the site,

43
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,030
so viewership was then and remains now a complete
mystery.

44
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,539
Nonetheless, success was clear.

45
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:49,780
Thousands of emails poured into Strong Bad's
account every day, their web-hosting bills

46
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,790
shot through the roof, and enough merch flew
off the shelf for the Chaps to go full-time.

47
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,929
Hank: The Homestar universe continued to grow
with new shows and Hollywood specials and

48
00:01:55,929 --> 00:02:00,819
games and collaborations; podcasting service,
DVDs, toys, posters, and a 20-track CD called

49
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,959
Strong Bad Sings and Other Type Hits.

50
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,240
References to the show popped up in Seventeen
Magazine, Guitar Hero and Buffy the Vampire

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Slayer.

52
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,169
Ryder: With Homestar at the height of its
popularity, video game developers Telltale

53
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,220
games approached the Chaps about working on
a point-and-click adventure game based on

54
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,659
the homestar runner universe, and on April
10th 2000-and-8, Strong Bad's "Cool Game for

55
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,750
Attractive People" was announced for both
Wiiware and PC.

56
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,760
Hank: So by 2009, it seemed that the brothers
Chaps were on a roll, having at that point

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,530
released over two hundred SB-mails and created
a massive online entity from the ground up.

58
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,680
It seemed as if they could only continue to
grow bigger and better but then suddenly...

59
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,790
nothing.

60
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,709
Starting in late 2009, Homestar Runner went
virtually silent.

61
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:34,010
No new tunes, no new sbemails, nothing.

62
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,750
According to the Chaps, the silence was unexplained
because they didn't know how to explain it.

63
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,280
Ryder: After working on the stuff for ten
years straight, the two mutually decided to

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,680
take a short break from Homestar.

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,610
During this time, Matt moved to LA where he
began to work as a writer and director for

66
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,560
shows like Yo Gabba Gabba and Gravity Falls.

67
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,590
They never really knew how long this break
would last, but they also never anticipated

68
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,110
that it would stretch on for four years, and
for fans, this was less of a well-deserved

69
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,019
break and more of an unexpected and unexplained
indefinite hiatus.

70
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,010
Hank: But then, out of nowhere, on April 1st,
2014, the Chaps released their first full-length

71
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,080
homestar cartoon in four years.

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
Fans were absolutely elated, and since the
release of that 'toon, the Chaps have confirmed

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,319
their plans to bring back Homestar Runner.

74
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,049
Everything seems to be set in motion for Homestar's
triumphant return.

75
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:14,680
The fan community is still very much alive,
Matt's moved back home from LA, and their

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,400
April Fool's 'toon, in addition to a handful
of other new toons, showed that they hadn't

77
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,760
even gotten the slightest bit rusty.

78
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,030
Ryder: But a lot has changed on the Internet
in these four years.

79
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,810
Flash websites are a thing of the past.

80
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,750
Everyone goes to YouTube now for their online
video needs, and a lot of what made Homestar

81
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,620
special was it's interactivity which can't
be done on YouTube.

82
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,769
So how do you bring Homestar into the modern
age?

83
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,689
Well, we'll just have to wait and see what
wonders the Chaps cook up for us.

84
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:37,010
Hank: Homestar Runner pioneered the online
video industry, and without it, I doubt that

85
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,810
many of us would even be here today.

86
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,290
It predates YouTube by five years, yet watching
it feels as fresh and entertaining as ever.

87
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,370
And now, after four years of silence, Strong
Bad is finally booting up the Compy 386 again.

88
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,620
Rejoice, everyone!

89
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,810
Homestar Runner is back.

90
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,650
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

91
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,959
Thanks to Ryder Burgin for helping me with
this special brief history.

92
00:03:54,959 --> 00:00:00,000

History of Harry Potter, on his channel, YouTube.com/footofaferret.
