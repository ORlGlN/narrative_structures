00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,070
good morning John is Monday September

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:11,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">17th</font>

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,610
Danny was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his dad left it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,850
sudden and nasty<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mostly just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sad it</font>

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,789
seemed like he<font color="#E5E5E5"> left immediately like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,010
week the volume of conversation started

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">increasing and the next week</font>

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">tranquility was abandoned completely and</font>

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,570
then they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> just cried for hours they</font>

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,579
just held<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other and cried and then</font>

12
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mom wouldn't tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,079
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> only that he might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

14
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,989
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year to slowly talk</font>

15
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:41,610
filtered<font color="#E5E5E5"> into Danny's ears talk about</font>

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,410
his father's lapse in religious vows

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about his mother swinging from the</font>

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">path and finally talk of other women</font>

19
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,250
mistresses that Danny had<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

20
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,469
imagined his little<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asian women in red</font>

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,680
silk dresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> his mom of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font>

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
said anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> she didn't</font>

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,789
deny<font color="#E5E5E5"> it either</font>

24
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,109
so Danny sifted through it all and

25
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,760
pulled out what still made sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

26
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
first he couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine his father</font>

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,390
with other women<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then after a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

28
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">years he'd started to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> himself</font>

29
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,450
with some other women<font color="#CCCCCC"> and his</font>

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,880
perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> had shifted maybe she was a</font>

31
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,409
Buddhist from birth<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe she was</font>

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:15,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chinese like his father unlike his</font>

33
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,909
mother reminding him of<font color="#E5E5E5"> home and faith</font>

34
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,189
in of the path maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> the divorce really</font>

35
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">was about religion that at least would</font>

36
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,259
explain the big and induced sobbing it's

37
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,659
okay mom it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that big of a deal he</font>

38
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:28,860
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> popping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up at the can getting ready</font>

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,049
for the losing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my religion talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he could</font>

40
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">handle that your dad didn't leave me it</font>

41
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,189
was a funny thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for her to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say but</font>

42
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">Danny bit his tongue before pointing out</font>

43
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,960
the obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left he's gone I</font>

44
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,049
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there wasn't a woman there</font>

45
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't anything we just we only got him</font>

46
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,000
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the deal the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal</font>

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,329
was all that Danny could manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't</font>

48
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm not supposed to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you your father</font>

49
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">he graduated from the priesthood at a</font>

50
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,420
young<font color="#CCCCCC"> age he was still young</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the border to a mission</font>

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's where I met him Danny stared</font>

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,360
priest<font color="#CCCCCC"> his mouth must have hung too low</font>

56
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">because his mom finally laughed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I know</font>

57
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,190
how could<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lame old mom be an</font>

exporter skid<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I wasn't there long</font>

59
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,210
and somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I left he came with me</font>

60
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were well there were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems with</font>

62
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,410
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live that life and he</font>

63
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,110
needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mission he got out</font>

64
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,330
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

65
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,370
way he kept telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said it</font>

66
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,200
until I believed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we came</font>

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we lived and we raised you</font>

72
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,910

73
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">until he realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was out there</font>
