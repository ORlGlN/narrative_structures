00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning John.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,540
I had the pleasure of attending YouTube's Education summit recently

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,800
and meeting a ton of amazing ed-YouTubers

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,400
including CGP Grey, who, everyone agrees the world needs more of.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,100
He told me that making videos in his style was very hard

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,800
and so today, to prove it to him that I could do it, I'm going to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about apples.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,860
No... not those apples

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,900
Original apples,  no the original apples

9
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,540
Apples are wonderful. Sweet, Tart, Big, Small, Red, Green, Yellow, Brown, Purple

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,520
Every apple that has ever passed your lips I can almost guarantee

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,480
was descended from wild apple trees in Kazakhstan.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,840
American as apple pie... Nope! Immigrants.

13
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,000
The oldest known apple pie recipe was written in 1381.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,940
Apples may have indeed have been the first cultivated fruit tree in human history

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,320
And the fruit has been part of Asian and European culture since

16
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,820
Well... hmm

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:06,680
Unfortunately until the 17th century the word for apple in both old english and latin was used as a generic term for all fruits

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,920
Apple, apple, apple, apple, apple

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,260
Not berries though - they had their own word but nuts? apples.

20
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,360
so its difficult to determine whether it's 'apple apples' being written about in ancient texts

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,860
or when it percimine apples or fig apples or pomegranate apples

22
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,200
Nonetheless their sweet decadence has them heavily featured in greek myths

23
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,920
Execially ones about beauty and sexuality

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,460
and throwing a apple at a young lady was a way of saying hey I fancy you

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,360
as long as you didn't throw it too hard.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,480
while apples are immigrants, America does have some great apple history.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,780
particularly the story of Johnny Appleseed who, unlike Paul Bunyan and Pecos Bill, was actually a real person

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,380
John Chapman was a businessman, nomad, missionary and kinda crazy person

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,680
who crossed the american frontier making sure everyone had plenty of apple saplings

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,820
many american settlers were actually required to plant fruit trees on their property

31
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,820
as a sign that they were improving the land that they had claimed as theirs

32
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:07,160
Chapmans business operation relied on him planting tree nurseries from seed and then selling the saplings

33
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,240
which, for anyone who knows anything about apple trees, sounds nuts

34
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,740
apple fruits exhibit something known as extreme heterozygosity

35
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:19,920
meaning that the apple of a daughter tree will look and taste nothing like that of the mother

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,380
the default phenotype for apple taste appears to be terrible

37
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,460
once you do find a tree with a tasty apple you craft buds or limbs off that tree creating clones

38
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,900
of the original tree on top of the root stalk of a seeded tree

39
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,180
Chapman didn't do that

40
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:39,860
he just planted the seeds creating tons of terrible tasting apples

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,800
why ... no one cared

42
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,600
no one was interested in eating them; apples were mashed for their juice and fermented into booze

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,160
first because everyone had seen dysentery first hand and no one trusted the water

44
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,480
and second because, well, booze

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,600
while most apples were destined for cider, farmers always had their eye out for that one tree with nice, tasty eating apples in the orchard

46
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,840
and those that found good ones won a kind of cosmic lottery and often became rich selling grafts and apples

47
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,920
for example the tree that scotsman John Mcintosh discovered on a farm in 1796 in Canada

48
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,180
a small sweat crisp apple, red with swatches of green

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,460
from that one tree in effect came every Mcintosh apple ever eaten

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:30,660
the Mcintosh apple was so successful that it inspired the naming of the Apple Macintosh

51
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,760
which some how happens to be the kind of computer I'm editing this video on right now

52
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,340
There you have it! Everything you ever wanted to know about apples

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,760
or... yeah.

54
00:03:44,480 --> 00:00:00,000
