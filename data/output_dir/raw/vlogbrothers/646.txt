1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
Good Morning Hank, It's Tuesday, and as you can tell from the grey speckled walls behind me,

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,900
in a stirring turn of events, I am in an airport.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,900
I have to go to this big book conference called BEA,

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,400
and give a bunch of speeches, and I'm super nervous.

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,200
It's question Tuesday, the day that I answer real questions from Real Nerdfighters.  Let's  get right to it.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,900
Q: Hard tacos or soft tacos?

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,400
A: Burritos.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,200
Q: Would you ever consider doing a video upside down?

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
A: What do you mean like this?

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,900
Or like this?

11
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,900
I could do this, but the people in the airport are looking at me kind of weird.

12
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,000
Ugh, I'm too old for physical comedy. 
(groans)

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,800
Q: Hey, whatever happened to the Abundance of Katherines cover contest?

14
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,300
A: Actually that's part of the reason I'm going to New York.

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,400
I get too announce the winner on Thursday, and reveal the cover.

16
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,500
And I'm so excited!

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,400
Q: How do you feel about Looking For Alaska getting banned from several

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
high schools in Tennessee?

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,600
A: Yeah bad, I mean that stuff used to make me really angry,

20
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,100
now it just makes me sad.

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,500
I set a book in you Tennessee, 
this is how you repay me?

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,100
So Hank, I'm here on the 39th floor of my hotel, 
and there is a rope.

23
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,900
A rope.

24
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,100
I don't know if there's somebody above or below me.

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,000
But I'm afraid for them, and a little bit for myself.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,400
I would go to the edge of the room and look but I can't get too close to the window or I get nervous.

27
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,500
BACK TO QUESTION TUESDAY!

28
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,700
Q: Would you go on Dancing With the Stars?

29
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,500
A: No, it combines two of my least favorite things:
reality television and dancing in front of people.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Q: Would you be okay with the United States becoming more like Canada?

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,900
A: Well if you mean living in a country where people live longer healthier lives,

32
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:20,800
are more likely to be employed, less likely to experience sexual violence. Then, I guess so.

33
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,600
But, if you mean putting a Queen on our money? 
HELL NO!

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,500
Q: At what age did you hit puberty?

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,100
A: Well I didn't really hit it, so much as 
I sort of gently bumped into it.

36
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,500
But I was about 14.

37
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,300
Q: Exactly how bad is your eyesight?

38
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,800
A: Well it's just a little bit better than my dad's.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,600
One time when we were kids, my dad lost his glasses
in the ocean when we were at the beach.

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,800
And later we were watching T.V. and he said, 
"Hey John, could you move those clothes?"

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,200
and I said, 
"Dad, that's Hank."

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,000
Q: Favorite book of the year?

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,100
A: So far, Behind The Beautiful Forevers.

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,300
Q: Henry's first word?
A: Hi.

45
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Q: Favorite movie?
A: Harvey.

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,000
Q: Why do wasps exist?

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
A: Why do you exist?

48
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Q: Favorite infinite set?
A: Real Numbers.

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
Q: Favorite Beatles album?
A: White.

50
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
Q: Favorite YouTuber?
A: Charlie.

51
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,200
Q: Is the Yeti a Nerdfighter?
A: YES!

52
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
Q: Meaning of Life?
A: Helping.

53
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Q: Favorite Shakespeare Play?

54
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,700
A: I've answered that before, I think last time I said Hamlet, so this time I'm going to say Macbeth.

55
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Q: Are you afraid of Sharks?

56
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,199
A: Yeah, why do you think I live in Indianapolis, 
we've got awesome shark insulation.

57
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,699
Q: Pineapples or people?

58
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,300
A: Hmm, that's tough, both pineapples and people are kind of prickly,

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,700
and they both manage to somehow be simultaneously too sweet and too sour.

60
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:20,300
But I think I'm going to have to go with people,
just because I find them more physically attractive.

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,700
But, on the other hand you can eat pineapples...
No, I'm going to stick with people.

62
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,000
I mean you can eat them in a pinch.

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,500
Q: Will you cast Nerdfighters in The Fault In Our Stars movie?

64
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
A: Right so I know this sounds weird,
but if Fox makes a movie of The Fault In Our Stars,

65
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,200
I will have exactly as much say in casting as you will.

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,500
And the reason they don't trust me to make those casting decisions is that

67
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,600
I should not be trusted with that decision, 
because in my mind,

68
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,900
Drew Barrymore is still like 16 years old.

69
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,900
I'll be like "Why not Jennifer Lopez for Hazel,

70
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,400
and that charming, young, up and coming Hugh Grant for Augustus."

71
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,600
So yeah if they make the movie,
it'll go how it always goes,

72
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,200
which is that we'll all find out about the casting.

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
We'll all be upset about it, and then we'll go to the movie,

74
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
and we'll be like "Oh my god! Jennifer Lawrence was the perfect Katniss!"

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,700
and then we'll be in love with Jennifer Lawrence,
but not in a creepy way...

76
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:04,000
although we do follow her tag on Tumblr,  he said, referring to himself in the first person plural.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Q; How do I gently tell a boy that I'm not romantically interested in him?

78
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,600
A: I have exactly one piece of relationship advice.

79
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,400
USE. YOUR. WORDS.

80
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
Hank, DFTBA! I have to go give a speech to some librarians but

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
I will see you on Friday!

82
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,200
*whispers* Scary.

83
00:03:20,900 --> 00:00:00,000
Ahhhhhh, why does it move so much?
