00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,820
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:01,720
Let's talk about the first part of

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,360
Fahrenheit 451,

4
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,280
the famous temperature at which

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,000
love boils.

6
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,580
No, that's the temperature which books burn.

7
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,060
So, Fahrenheit 451 introduces us to Guy Montag, who's just a regular guy.

8
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:20,240
He's a fireman, he likes to fill his firehose up with kerosene and then spew it all over books and burn them to maintain social stability,

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,980
he hangs out with other firemen and a mechanised dog who is both alive and dead.

10
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:26,820
And then after work he goes home to his house, which is likened to a mausoleum.

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,220
I match the wall by the way, that's probably not good.

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,080
I'll try and stay over here so you know I have a torso.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:38,220
Anyway, his wife Mildred is also described as both alive and dead. She spends her days and nights listening to and watching mindless entertainment.

14
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:44,200
And she attempts suicide but she is saved by this mechanical snake-like thing that goes into her belly and sucks out all the poison,

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,500
and that snake incidentally, also described as both alive and dead.

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,420
In fact everything is both alive and dead in Fahrenheit 451,

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:55,640
when an old woman makes it clear that she'd rather die than live without her books, the fire captain Beatty says...

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,640
"The people in those books never lived"

19
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,740
But of course the people in this book never really live either.

20
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:05,860
Mildred lives vicariously through this entertainment that's so mindless that five minutes later she can't even remember what it was about.

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,020
The firemen just live for the cheap thrill of watching things burn.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,640
Mildred and Guy can't even remember how they met!

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,640
At one point these fighter jets blow past and Montag is described as feeling as if those jets "pulverised the stars".

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,560
I think the message is pretty clear there Hank; technology has pulverised our nature.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,420
But of course Montag is shaken out of his life thinking little at all about nothing in particular by Clarice,

26
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,060
this beautiful teenager who sees everything Clear-ice-ly.

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,060
She literally reminds Montag of the natural world,

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,140
she smells like apricots, her face is like snow in the moonlight.

29
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,100
But she also reintroduces Montag to the world of nature and natural experience, eventually literally making him taste the rain.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,500
Incidentally, taste the rain would make a great euphemism but I don't know for what.

31
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,780
Maybe it would be a good catchphrase if I ever become like a professional wrestler named The Rain,

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,400
like, "Get ready to taste The Rain!"

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,180
It's not good, I'm not going to become a professional wrestler I need to just accept it.

34
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:01,760
And then of course after Guy tasted the rain, Clarice disappears presumably dead in the great tradition of the manic pixie dream girl.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,400
But she's already changed him.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,800
And he is collecting books that he ought to be burning. Which threatens not just his career as a firefighter but also, you know, his life.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,140
So Hank, one of the weird things about Dystopian fiction is that it has a way of coming true,

38
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,160
so I just want to establish right now, that if there is ever a Hunger Games,

39
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,220
I will not be volunteering as tribute on your behalf.

40
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,240
And Fahrenheit 451 has perhaps the most dramatic example of this in our literature,

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,060
so let's have some historical context.

42
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,640
Ray Bradbury wrote this book in a library on a typewriter that cost 20 cents an hour to rent,

43
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,880
which might be why it is so short.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,800
He also wrote it in a time where mass media didn't really have that much mass.

45
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,380
At the time only about a million American households had televisions,

46
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:44,020
and for several hours each day and most markets literally nothing was on TV because presumably they didn't have Simpsons reruns yet.

47
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,060
Today, of course, the average American watches 150 hours of TV each month,

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,520
and in the average American household, just like Guy Montag's house, there are more TVs than people.

49
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,980
We also go outside far less than we did in Bradbury's day and when we do go outside,

50
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,680
we often insert these little machines into our ears so we can hear more interesting sounds than bird song.

51
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
Now we don't burn books, but we do read fewer of them every year.

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,220
Bradbury predicted all of these changes and he also predicted that the change,

53
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,820
if I may quote Captain Beatty,

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:15,080
"Didn't come from the Government down; there was no dictum, no declaration, no censorship to start with, no."

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,580
We made the world in which we live, not some all powerful other.

56
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:22,120
So Hank, it seems to me that Fahrenheit 451 is an old-fashioned novel of ideas,

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,780
like Jonathan Livingstone's Seagull or The Fountain Head, and usually those books really annoy me,

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,980
because they aren't really about book burning firemen, they are really about the perils and privileges of technology or whatever.

59
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,120
But here, even though I do find the character of Clarice totally unconvincing,

60
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,620
I really love this book because it is profoundly unsettling.

61
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,420
Have we replaced intellectual engagement with superficial browsing?

62
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,340
Is it really possible to pay sustained attention in a world full of distractions,

63
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,760
a world where we can watch an episode of CSI and 3 months later watch it again and not be sure if we have seen it before?

64
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,620
Actually, let me put that question a different way, when do you feel least like you are wasting your life?

65
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:03,860
Maybe that's different for everyone, like I'm not Clarice, I like nature but it doesn't make me feel particularly alive,

66
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,120
it mostly makes me feel super conscious of the fact that mosquitoes carry the West Nile virus.

67
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,920
For me, I feel most alive when I am having conversations with family and friends about stuff that matters to me, like, now for instance.

68
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,040
This is making me feel alive!

69
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't know what you thought of the book, or what makes your life feel meaningful but I'd like to know,

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,800
I'd like to continue the conversation so I can continue to feel alive and not like Guy Montag.

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,200
So Nerdfighters, I will see you in comments and Hank, I will see you on Friday.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,940
Oh hey, P.S. the new episode of Crash Course World History is about the surprisingly complicated and fascinating story of slavery,

73
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,700
also last week I did the Cinnamon Challenge while discussing the Columbian Exchange, so check that out,

74
00:04:39,700 --> 00:00:00,000
you can click the screen now but not any later than now because the video's gonna end.
