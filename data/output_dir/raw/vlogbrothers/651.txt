00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
Good morning, Hank, it's Tuesday. I really liked your video about marriage equality on Friday, but

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:07,360
today I wanted to approach the question of gay marriage from a specifically religious perspective.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,400
But to do that we have to first figure out what exactly marriage is, which turns out to be incredibly complicated.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,900
All right, so to illustrate this, I'm gonna make yellow thingamajigs men and blue whozeewhats women.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,020
Let's begin with the idea that so-called "traditional marriage" is a union between one man and one woman.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,060
Well that's simply not accurate:

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,600
There are some very traditional marriages that did not feature just one man and one woman.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,880
For instance, in the Bible, King David was married to... 18 women,

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,560
and Solomon, who was known for his good judgement, was married to seven hundred!

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,680
Which is not even to mention his three hundred concubines. Frankly, it just seems greedy.

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,360
In fact I think almost everything we associate with traditional marriages

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,360
-- from white dresses, to monogamy, to scripture readings, to saying "I do" --

13
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:47,060
is not very traditional.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,600
For the vast majority of Christian history until the 16th century,

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,440
it was uncommon for Christian marriages to happen in churches, or to be overseen by clergy, or even to feature witnesses!

16
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,700
People became married by agreeing to be married and then honoring that commitment.

17
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,820
It was just, "I marry you," "I marry you," "Mmmmmmarried!"

18
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,820
And then often, but not always, they let the church know that they got married, because the church kept the records.

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,080
Furthermore the idea that marriages always occur between one man and one woman

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,000
imply that everyone is either a man or a woman, which is simply not the case it and it never has been!

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,200
A significant portion of the human population -- somewhere around 0.5% -- has always been intersex.

22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,100
Intersex people might be chromosomally XXY, or XYY, or have androgen insensitivity syndrome,

23
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:30,160
or a bunch of other conditions that make them neither unambiguously male nor unambiguously female.

24
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,000
Historically, many of these people have gotten married without the social order falling apart

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,660
and many of them still get married today,

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,700
but laws like the one just voted on in North Carolina make it unclear whether intersex people are allowed to marry anyone.

27
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Right, so marriage and sex turn out to be very complicated.

28
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,340
Well I'm about to make it more complicated.

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,340
So for many religious people, including lots of Christians, Jews, and Muslims,

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,260
marriage is not just a legal agreement, but a covenant.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,640
You're making a promise to God that you will stick together for life.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,060
And for many religious people, marriage is only really marriage if that covenant is involved.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,800
And that means that for lots of those people, gay marriage is impossible,

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
because "homosexual relationships are inherently sinful"

35
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,220
which means that God cannot be present in and bless that union.

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,539
Now Hank, I should add that lots of religious people and institutions don't believe that,

37
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,180
but some do, and I'm not going to try to convince those people or those institutions that they are wrong,

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:18,320
because 1) it won't work, and
2) I read the comments from your last video.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,260
It was a little discouraging.

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,840
But Hank, if we're gonna say that the legal benefits of marriage should only be extended to people

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,380
who have made this covenant with God, then we get ourselves into a HUGE problem!

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,020
Like you and The Katherine got married in a field - does that mean you're not really married?

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Like should you be allowed to visit The Katherine in the hospital, or share custody of kids you adopt,

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,300
or file taxes together?

45
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,240
Or should those privileges only extend to people who got married in a church, like me?

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,420
And do all church weddings count, or only people who get married in certain kinds of churches?

47
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,760
Because then I might be in trouble.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,180
Hank, that line of thinking does not lead to a good legal definition of marriage.

49
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:53,000
The truth is, marriages are intensely personal, and they are defined not by courts or by voters,

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,960
but by the people who live inside of them.

51
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,580
That's traditional marriage! People making a private, daily, life-long commitment.

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:04,040
We can't make gay marriage illegal because gay marriage is already happening.

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,200
It has been happening, in fact, for as long as human beings have been pledging themselves to each other.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,180
But tragically, in most of the world, we deny gay people the rights and obligations that are associated with their marriages.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,540
And that is just discrimination.

56
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,680
There are going to be marriages you don't like

57
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,440
and married people who do things that you don't think married people should do.

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,760
But whether they're getting married, or they're getting married, or they're getting married,

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,820
those marriages won't affect yours.

60
00:03:28,820 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, I'll see you on Friday.
