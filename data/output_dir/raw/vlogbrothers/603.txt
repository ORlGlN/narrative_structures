1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good  morning Hank, it's Tuesday. So, one of the biggest issues in global politics these days

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,840
is government debt and deficits, which is a particularly big deal in the United States

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,300
because of the Presidential campaign and also because of the looming fiscal cliff.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,720
And Hank, as you'll no doubt remember, I received a bronze medal in economics

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,820
at the 1994 Alabama State Academic Decathlon, meaning that in 1994,

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,420
I was the third best seventeen-year-old economist among all C students in the state of Alabama,

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,480
so not to brag or anything, but I'm pretty qualified to explain this stuff.

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,060
Okay, so first we have to separate the ideas of debt and deficit.

9
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,940
Debt is the total amount of our outstanding liabilities.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:38,860
Deficit , or occasionally surplus, is the difference between what the government spends and what it takes in.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,880
Right, so in the United States, our current national debt is around 16 trillion dollars,

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,900
which sounds like a lot of money, and it is.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,640
But let's break this down.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,580
The largest single holder of U.S. government debt is actually the Federal Government itself

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:58,360
because trust funds like Social Security buy government bons and so the interest goes from the U.S. government to a different part of the U.S.government,

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
which is not borrowing as we usually imagine it.

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,300
So if you take away that money, you're left with about 11 trillion dollars, which is still a fair bit of cash.

18
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,360
Who owns that debt?

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,520
China, you probably guessed, but in fact, no. The plurality of that debt is actually owned by us.

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,300
Us being American individuals and institutions.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,060
China owns about 8% of our debt, Japan 7% and the UK, 1%.

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,420
But it's important to note that the US also owns foreign debt, including about 235 billion dollars

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,580
of sovereign debt in China and Hong Kong.

24
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:28,440
Altogether, for every one dollar of US debt that's owned by a foreign country,

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,280
we own about 89 cents of foreign debt.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,500
So you can't really think of government debt the same way you'd think about, like, a family

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,400
owing money to a credit card company because in that situation, the family owes money to someone else.

28
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:46,420
But in the case of US government debt, we mostly, indirectly or directly, owe money to ourselves.

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,860
So our national debt is a very large number, but at least at the moment, it is not a very large problem.

30
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,640
Like in 2011, we paid about 3% total interest on our debt. In 2012, it will be even less because our debt

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,920
is incredibly cheap right now.

32
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,940
I mean, Hank, in some ways, it is literally cheaper than free. Right now, the yield on a one year treasury bon

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:10,840
is 0.17%. Okay, two very important things to note about the debt:

34
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,040
First, China can't, like, call in our debt on a day of its choosing.

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,580
If I buy a $100, one year treasury bon today, I'm going to get that $100 back, along with my 17 cents in interest

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,580
in one year. I can't call after a month and be like, "Give me my money back!"

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,000
So despite what you hear from a lot of political commentators, that is not really a risk

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,200
to the US economy. Secondly, you may have heard people say, "The government should be run

39
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,240
like a business. It should never spend more than it takes in."

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,760
Yeah, no, that is not how businesses are run. Like, say that tomorrow, I invent a Marty McFly

41
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,100
hovercraft skateboard. In that situation, I wouldn't wait twenty years until I've sold enough DFTBA posters

42
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:48,280
to build my Marty McFly hoverboard factory. I would just borrow the money and build the factory immediately

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,660
so I could start selling hoverboards and swim in a sea of hundred dollar bills.

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:58,480
Actually, I would not swim in a sea of hundred dollar bills. I would hoverboard over that sea.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,440
Businesses spend more than they bring in all the time, as well they should

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,560
and almost all economists agree that governments are similar. There are times when they need

47
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,100
to run deficits. For instance, during a recession, government revenue goes down

48
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,500
because wages stagnate and unemployment goes up. But government expenditures have to go up,

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,160
like on unemployment benefits, for instance. So just to be clear, deficits are not inherently evil

50
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,020
and our current debt, while it is very large, does not pose a threat to the American economy because we can

51
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,380
pay it back with relative ease. I mean, it's not going to be free, but it's going to be like 2% of GDP.

52
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,200
We've done it before!

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,080
However, there is a huge future risk to us, because what if our debt stopped being cheap?

54
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,320
What if people stopped believing that the US is the safest place to put their money and they start to

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,060
buy bonds in, I don't know, like Brazil or China or Germany?

56
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,600
Well, that would be very bad because most years, we run a budget deficit and so we would need to keep

57
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,860
borrowing money at these higher interest rates, which would necessitate more deficits,

58
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:54,740
and therefore more borrowing at progressively higher interest rates.

59
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,540
And then we'd have to cut spending, which would slow growth and raise taxes,

60
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,020
which would slow growth more, and then Greece.

61
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,540
Except this might actually be much worse for us than it's been for Greece because the US enjoys all kinds of

62
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,760
benefits from having the world's most trusted currency.

63
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,140
Like, Hank, believe it or not, most US paper currency actually circulates outside the US

64
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,320
and that's very helpful for us in terms of exchange rates and keeping our debt cheap

65
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,459
and if we lost that, it would be devastating because we would just be a regular country again.

66
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,060
Okay, so the federal deficit in 2011 was about 1.3 trillion. It'll be down a little bit this year to about a trillion.

67
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,600
It'll be down further in 2013, no matter who is president, to about 900 billion.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,180
But most people think that number needs to continue to come down, or at some point, we are going to risk

69
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,120
the spiraling higher interest rates.

70
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,280
So there are two ways of doing this. This first is to print more money, like, oh, we need a hundred billion dollars

71
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,400
to close the deficit? Look, I just made a hundred billion dollars using a printing press!

72
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,280
That sounds like a fine idea, except that it will lead to inflation. Now a lot of people in comments will be saying

73
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,380
that we should just return to the gold standard, which I think is a very bad idea, for the reasons I explain

74
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,560
in the dooblydoo. However:

75
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,660
In the broadest sense, our currency is already pegged to goods and services

76
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,860
because if the amount of money in the world doubled tomorrow, the amount of stuff wouldn't,

77
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,540
so you can imagine what would happen to the cost of everything: It would double.

78
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,500
The second, and better, way to cut the deficit is to close the gap between what we take in

79
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,060
and what we spend, and in times of economic expansion, this is actually quite easy

80
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,600
because the tax base grows and the amount of money people make goes up, so they pay more taxes,

81
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,940
so we can just have surpluses, as we did in the 1990s.

82
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,260
But during slow recoveries, like the one we have right now, it is much more complicated.

83
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,100
So, like, both President Obama and Governor Romney favored unspecified spending cuts,

84
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,400
Governor Romney also favors a tax cut of 20% across the board,

85
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,840
whereas President Obama thinks that we should increase taxes by rolling back the Bush era tax cut

86
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,800
on income over $250,000. Neither of these plans is likely to eliminate the deficit,

87
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,600
although, again, the deficit doesn't necessarily need to be eliminated.

88
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,540
And no matter what political rhetoric you hear, neither of these plans is terribly radical either.

89
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,240
President Obama wants to put the top marginal income tax rate at 39%.

90
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,400
It was over 50% every year from 1945 until 1986.

91
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:02,440
Mitt Romney wants to cut that tax rate to 28.5%, which is where it was in 1989.

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,080
We can argue thoughtfully about what our policy position should be, but amid all the rhetoric and

93
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,040
decontextualized statistics, I just want to underscore that while deficit reduction is important,

94
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,860
it is not a crisis. The whole idea here is to keep it from becoming a crisis and one of the best ways to do that

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,020
is to understand the problem without yelling about it, discuss things honestly without assuming

96
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,820
that the people who disagree with you hate America.

97
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,620
Hank, I'll see you on Friday.

98
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,040
PS, friendly reminder, educational videos are allowed to be over four minutes.

99
00:06:31,040 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm still working on my punishment, sorry.
