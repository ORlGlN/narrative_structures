1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100
Good morning Hank. It's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,105 --> 00:00:04,019
I landed in Venice, Italy yesterday morning feeling a smidge tired

3
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:06,340
and then stood in this very long customs line

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,540
before catching a ride into the city.

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,560
Are we gonna see some Palazzos?

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,780
SARAH : If we want to.

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,100
What about some statuettos?

8
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,940
Are you-a gonna be annoyed if this whole trip I'm just gonna

9
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,580
add a vowel to the end of a noun.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:19,840
SARAH : Yes

11
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,460
Is that gonna offend you?

12
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,380
SARAH : It is.

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,140
Okay... well.

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,020
I'll bear that in mind-o.

15
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,280
We're in Venice to film this huge art show called the

16
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,560
The Venice Biennale for the Art Assignment,

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,820
Sarah's show with PBS, but our filming didn't start until tomorrow

18
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,720
So we checked into our hotel room,

19
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,640
Marveled at the view,

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,660
And then set out into the city.

21
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,900
Venice is a very crowded city, but not with residents.

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,060
It's population has shrunk by more than half in the last forty years.

23
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,160
In fact, more people lived in Venice a thousand years ago,

24
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,900
than do so today.

25
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,940
But visitors still arrive in droves to see the great floating city,

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,080
Its' narrow alleys,

27
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,120
Its' gondolas,

28
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,800
And its' famed art and architecture.

29
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:57,380
It's so picturesque it often doesn't seem real,

30
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,380
And I guess in some ways it isn't.

31
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,120
I mean in the eighteenth century there were more than eight thousand gondolas in Venice

32
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,000
and they were the primary means of transportation.

33
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:09,000
Today, there are about four hundred, and they're used almost exclusively by tourists

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,720
Then again you can't really complain about crowds of tourists

35
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,980
When you are, you know, part of that crowd

36
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,420
So first we made our way past the Fenice Theater,

37
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,840
down a series of winding alley ways ,

38
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,520
to the Libreria Alta Acqua

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,280
This sprawling canal-side bookstore with towers of books pressing in on all sides.

40
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,020
Outside books that have decayed past the point of readability formed

41
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,660
a kind of sculpture. A reminder I guess of where all books are going.

42
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,615
And also all cities.

43
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:35,695
But there's no to despair about such inevitabilitys because there's gelatto!

44
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,320
I got tiramisu and chocolate and it was amazing!

45
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,760
 

46
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:43,695
We stopped at the top of the bridge over the grand canal to marvel at the view

47
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:45,985
And then made our way to the Peggy Guggenheim collection.

48
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:48,775
Where we saw an Anish Kapoor sculpture, and this Sarah-ish Modigliani

49
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,675
And art by Warhol and Frank Stella

50
00:01:51,675 --> 00:01:54,225
and Picasso and Jackson Pollock but mostly I saw the

51
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:56,785
backs of people's heads because it was really crowded.

52
00:01:56,785 --> 00:01:58,825
So we made our way back outside and sat for a while on this bridge

53
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:01,825
watching the Gondolas come and go. It was

54
00:02:01,825 --> 00:02:04,565
ridiculously beautiful and the sun felt good on my face and I

55
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:07,325
started thinking about the last time I was in Venice, just

56
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:10,195
over six years ago. My video that day began "I'm in Venice, and I'm really sick"

57
00:02:10,195 --> 00:02:10,695
 

58
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,905
I was in fact, very very sick

59
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:15,755
The next day I had to cut my visit short and fly back to Amsterdam,

60
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,995
it turned out that my gallbladder needed removing. But in

61
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:21,945
addition to the physical illness, my mental health was

62
00:02:21,945 --> 00:02:23,745
near an all time low. And now, six years later, Sarah

63
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:26,705
and I were walking toward the Piazza San Marco,

64
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,685
where I'd filmed that video. It's the tourist capital of Venice, and also

65
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:32,665
the pigeon capital and back in 2011,

66
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:35,765
I hated it. I remembered it smelling of death, and decay

67
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:38,705
and I hated the tourists and the pigeons and

68
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:41,495
the stupid flying lions everywhere and I was so sick

69
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,520
and so scared, and it sucked!

70
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,500
But yesterday afternoon, I was happy in the Piazza San Marco

71
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,495
Which has been a gathering place for humans for nearly a millennium.

72
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,040
I loved watching

73
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,995
families from all over the world,

74
00:02:52,995 --> 00:02:56,185
I loved watching people take selfies with history, God help me,

75
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:59,115
I didn't even mind the pigeons! And I was reminded that how you feel

76
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:02,155
at your worst is not how you're always going to feel. I mean, sure

77
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,720
the world is going to end, and Venice

78
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,020
will sink into the sea.

79
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:09,105
But not yet.  Sitting in the Piazza drinking

80
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,715
unconscionably expensive espresso, I was reminded that

81
00:03:11,715 --> 00:03:14,395
the world is what it is, but the world is also

82
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:17,425
what you bring to it, and who you share it with.

83
00:03:17,775 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, I'll see you on Friday.
