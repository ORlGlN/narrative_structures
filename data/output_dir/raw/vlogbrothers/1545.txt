00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,400
[intro music]

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,760
Good morning, Hank, it's Monday, February 19th.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:13,720
President's Day.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,860
Hank, that was Brotherhood 2.0 resident mathematician Daniel Biss!

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,500
Daniel's here because his brother Jonathan is playing a concert at Carnegie Hall.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,860
Oh, and speaking of concerts, I've had a lot of fun reading and listening to and watching all of the responses to your video survey.

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:34,400
It turns out that our viewers, by and large, had terrible taste in music when they were children.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,920
Let's just go over some of their first concerts:

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,880
*NSYNC

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,560
Paula Abdul

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:41,920
Chicago

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,420
Huey Lewis and the News

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,700
The New Kids on the Block

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,920
The Spice Girls

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:48,480
The Oak Ridge Boys

16
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,300
La Toya Jackson

17
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,460
La Toya Jackson?

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
Who goes to a La Toya Jackson concert?

19
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,380
Did La Toya Jackson ever even make music?

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,540
I thought she was just a stripper!

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,520
But a couple of our viewers' first concerts were pretty frakkin' awesome.

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,500
Lauren K. went to see the Dead Milkmen,

23
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,920
one of our favorite bands,

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,780
and she would definitely be the winner for awesomest first concert,

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,680
were it not for Christopher, whose first concert was was at the State Fair.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,060
[laughs]

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,840
Hold on, hold on.

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:23,080
And featured Weird Al Yankovic opening for the 3 remaining Monkees.

29
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,940
But the most disturbing thing about your first concert question

30
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,240
is that 2 Brotherhood 2.0 viewers have apparently never been to a concert.

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,060
Hank, I think it's vitally important that we get Melissa and Amy to a concert as soon as possible

32
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,120
and that's why I am proposing the creation of the Brotherhood 2.0 Concert Scholarship Fund

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,820
for Melissa and Amy and Also Possibly Other Brotherhood 2.0 Viewers Who Have Not Been to Concerts.

34
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,260
[sighs] The name is unwieldy, I think we need to work on that.

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,900
Anyway, I am going to give $20 to this scholarship fund,

36
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,420
I hope that you will match my pledge.

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,960
Hank, the other question I really liked was the question about how you have to invent your own question

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,820
and then answer it.

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,920
I wanted to answer some of my favorite questions that other people posed.

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,419
Kelly Feinmann asks, "If you could own a house in any country in the world other than the U.S.,

41
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,419
where would it be?"

42
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,220
Ireland.

43
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,900
Ally Carter asks, "Is your new book going to be worth all the effort?"

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,940
And finally, Laura asks,

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,060
"Where's the weirdest place you've ever brushed your teeth?"

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,100
Good question!

47
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:57,740
[rock music plays]

48
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,040
Hank, I'll see you tomorrow.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:00:00,000
