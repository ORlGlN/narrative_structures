00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Good morning, John! Here in the United States, election season is upon us.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,120
It's on the front page of the newspaper every day!

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,220
And I want to make it clear: from my perspective, there is only one wrong vote and that is no vote.

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,780
And I'm tired of people telling me their "good reasons" why they're not voting this year.

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,500
Almost all of the reasons that I hear are terrible!

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,080
So let's go through these terrible reasons one-by-one.

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,920
#1: "I don't live in America or am not yet 18".

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,700
Okay! You get a pass! You're the only one.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,600
"Elections are controlled entirely by Superpacs and Special Interest Groups".

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,440
Oh...really? Cos, uh...I'm, uh, I'm a little confused. How many votes do Superpacs get?

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,460
That's right! ZERO!

12
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,280
You know how many votes the richest, most powerful man in America gets to cast? One.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,740
He gets to cast one vote; the same number as you.

14
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:46,820
Voting is, if nothing else...it is fair.

15
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,740
"No election is ever decided by one vote. Mine can't matter!"

16
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,400
Okay. Voting, like almost everything that humans do, is a community activity.

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,380
The stuff you do...oftentimes, doesn't have an effect

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,420
unless you multiply it by all of the people who do it with you.

19
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,780
While one single vote might not count toward who wins the election,

20
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:13,700
every vote DOES count toward how politicians perceive their electorate: the people they represent.

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,100
An example: say a guy creates a YouTube video.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,640
A bunch of people watch it. Half of them are Twihards and half of them are, like, BBC Drama fans.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,660
If the Twihards leave comments 90% of the time and the Whovians leave comments 10% of the time,

24
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,960
then the person who makes the video will have no idea that all those Whovians are there

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,240
and so they will be much more likely in the future to make content for the Twihards.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,500
Even if, after all is said and done, there are more Twilight comments, every single Doctor Who fan comment

27
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,320
counts towards that creator's desire to make content for those people.

28
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,640
Voting is the YouTube comments of government.

29
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,740
Also, this why commenting on YouTube videos is important, especially if you feel uncomfortable doing it,

30
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,640
because if you do, chances are your demographic is underrepresented in the comments and so I won't make content for you.

31
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,880
"I don't live in a swing state, so it's not gonna matter."

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,340
Nooooooooooooooooooo! NO! NO! NO!

33
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,280
If every Democrat in Utah or every Californian Republican decided not to go to the polls because "their vote didn't matter",

34
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,960
not only would they tremendously underrepresented in local elections, but worst: politicians would not

35
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,880
take those people's viewpoints into account, because what do they care if they don't vote?

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,320
"I just...don't have time!"

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,920
I can understand this to a certain extent. I've been there.

38
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,940
And I would like to encourage you to investigate early voting in your state because it's pretty easy nowadays in most places.

39
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,040
The top link of the description will take you to a place that will help you figure that out.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,340
"But dude...everything is terrible."

41
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,660
I hear this a lot: that all politicians are terrible and that nothing ever changes,

42
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,740
but not only do I not believe it, it's, like, objectively untrue.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,920
Like, interracial marriage used to be illegal and soon, gay marriage will not be illegal. I really believe that.

44
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,120
As inefficient and infuriating American democracy can be,

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,780
it is a pretty good system and has done pretty well by us.

46
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,500
Like, yes, we have made some terrible decisions in our past...but America is, overall, pretty great,

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,140
and democracy, I think, is one of the big reasons why that happened.

48
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,000
Final reason why you might not vote this November: "I'm not registered."

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,420
Yeah! That would be a problem, and there is a deadline and it is coming up

50
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,520
so go to the top link in the description if you are not registered to vote and register to vote!

51
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,860
NOW!

52
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:26,300
I personally think, and you are welcome to disagree with me, that voting in America isn't a privilege, it's a responsibility.

53
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:32,740
It's a responsibility that we have to our country, to ourselves, to our fellow Americans, to the rest of the world and to the future.

54
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,280
Because this country's laws, and what this country does, affects everything!

55
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:44,780
This is our opportunity to have the exact same amount of influence on the future of the world as...the richest, most powerful people in the country.

56
00:03:44,780 --> 00:00:00,000
I can't believe people pass that opportunity up. John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
