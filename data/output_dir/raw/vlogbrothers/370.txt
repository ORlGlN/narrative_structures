1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,110
Hank: Good morning John, it's Friday.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:03,002
John: In fact it is Black Friday, the day
--

3
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:04,990
Hank: The darkest Friday of the year, the
blackest, deepest, dark.

4
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,760
It's so ominous.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,429
John: Everything is 20% off at dftba.com through
Monday, I think that is great news.

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,429
Hank: It's bad for us.

7
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,139
John: It's kinda bad for us.

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,139
Hank: We're crazy!

9
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:18,310
John: Have you ever seen, uh, an advertisement
for "Don's Guns" in Indianapolis?

10
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,720
Hank: No, I don't live in Indianapolis.

11
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:23,100
John: He sells guns, and at the end of every
commercial, he says, "I don't want to make

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,480
any money, I just love to sell guns."

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,810
Hank: *laughs* It's basically --

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,510
John: That's how I feel about hoodies.

15
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,480
Hank: I'm glad you don't feel that way about
guns.

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,550
John: Let's start the video over.

17
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,860
Hank: I think that was all gold.

18
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,860
John: Okay!

19
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,590
Hank: Black Friday is the day that happens
after Thanksgiving.

20
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,410
John: Thanksgiving is the day where we say
what we are thankful for.

21
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,400
So we thought that today we would say some
of the things that we are thankful for.

22
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Hank: Yeah!

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,680
John: I am thankful that childhood death around
the world is decreasing at an astonishing

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,110
pace, uh, that we are maybe only 30 or 40
years away from the vast majority of poor

25
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,050
countries being middle income countries.

26
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,280
Hank: That is a different direction than I
was going to go for the video.

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,251
I was thinking more like, "I'm thankful that
farts sound funny because otherwise they would

28
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:02,540
just be farts and it would just be stinky,
but with the funny sound, they're awesome.

29
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:09,460
John: I am also really grateful for Nerdfighteria,
uh, for like the chance to be part of a community

30
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:12,200
that's committed to doing good and also having
a lot of fun.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,210
Hank: I'm thankful for, like, human hair.

32
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,040
Because I think it's like, I think it's pretty,
and functional.

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,390
Hank: I'm thankful for people who work in
customer support.

34
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,700
John: Uh, I'm so thankful for everyone who
works in retail today, I have worked a Black

35
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,310
Friday or two in my life and it is not easy.

36
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,560
John: I'm really grateful that there's this
young generation of people who are committed

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,119
activists and working hard to decrease Worldsuck
on lots of fronts in their communities.

38
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:39,400
I think that's really exciting -

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,670
Hank: I'm grateful for all the things that
you were grateful for.

40
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,130
I'm also grateful that my dog is cool with
uh, me being the person who decides when and

41
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,130
where she poops.

42
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,049
Like, I would not put up with that.

43
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:52,450
John: You know what else I'm grateful for?

44
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,920
I'm grateful uh, that when I show up in Missoula,
Montana with no winter clothes because I've

45
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:04,549
been, uh, in North Carolina, that, uh, I happen
to own part of a warehouse that sells hoodies.

46
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,050
I can just layer myself in infinite hoodies.

47
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,590
Hank: Yeah, you could -- Right, you could
go from small all the way to extra extra large

48
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,590
and you could --

49
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,550
John: Realistically, I could go from large
all the way to extra extra large.

50
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,550
Hank: *laughs*

51
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,550
Hank: Here's one - Here's a serious one, here's
a serious one.

52
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:19,730
I am thankful that the earth's core is partially
liquid, allowing for currents in conductive

53
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:23,980
materials that produce the earth's electromagnetic
field, which allows us to go outside in the

54
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,980
daytime and not die.

55
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,980
John: Is that really true?

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Hank: Yeah -

57
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,980
John: I'm thankful for that -

58
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Hank: *laughs*

59
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,980
John: That sounds like a huge win!

60
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,980
Hank: Yeah!

61
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,620
John: I'm also grateful that humans landed
a thing on a comet.

62
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,480
Hank: This is so much harder than it sounds.

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,010
John: It sounds incredibly hard!

64
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,819
There's a comet, it's like 'vrrrr, vrrr vrrrr'
and we're like "I know what we'll do.

65
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,099
We'll shoot a slingshot and it'll hit the
comet."

66
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,030
You know what that reminds me of?

67
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:50,900
The miracle of AFC Wimbledon's journey to
League Two!

68
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,140
I gave one of these to Henry and you know
what he said when I put it on him?

69
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
Hank: What?

70
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,629
John: He said, "I'm gonna grow into this."

71
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:57,930
Hank: *Laughs*

72
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,980
Hank: There's a lot of things to be thankful
for!

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,660
John: I wanna know what you're thankful for,
Nerdfighteria!

74
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Hank: Yeah!

75
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,470
I wanna know a serious thing you're thankful
for and a silly thing you're thankful for.

76
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,519
John: I have to go and sign posters now.

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,290
I don't have the normal-est brain, and nothing
makes my brain feel calmer and happier than

78
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,599
signing over and over and over again.

79
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,120
It brings me great joy.

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,970
Nerdfighters, thank you for allowing me to
sign so many things in the last year.

81
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,780
I hope to be able to keep it up for the rest
of my life.

82
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,440
Hank: That is weird.

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,050
John, I will see you on Friday.

84
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,720
John: It will be Tuesday, and also right now.

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,310
Hank: No Friday, today is Friday.

86
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,379
John: Oh!

87
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,379
Perfect.

88
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,379
Good ending.
