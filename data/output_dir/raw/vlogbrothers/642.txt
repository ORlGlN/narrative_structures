00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Good Morning Hank! It's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,280
So on Friday, we asked Nerdfighters to share their 
problems with us and with each other.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,600
And they did so and I am here to help!

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,180
As the poet hath wrote,

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,540
"If you got a problem, yo, I'll solve it."

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,540
Let's get right to it!

7
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,380
"My laptop overheats so I can't play games."

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,800
You probably just need to clean your laptop stand 
but if that doesn't work -

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,760
Behold! A beautiful twenty dollar cooling pad!

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,220
"I feel that spiders are a big problem in the world."

11
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,220
Well,  the lack of spiders would be a much bigger problem.

12
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,940
But anyway, the solution to your problem is

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,920
192 pages long and it is beautiful 
and it's called 'Charlotte's Web'

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,040
Read it immediately.

15
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,460
"I'm scared of the dark."

16
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,880
Yeah, as well you should be. It's terrifying. 
Just be grateful you're not a vampire.

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,780
"My biggest problem is my sister. 
She is annoying and a vampire."

18
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,840
Yeah well to be fair she's probably annoying 
because she's a vampire.

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,100
Vampires don't have it easy. 
Even the sparkly kind have their struggles.

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,840
So you have to find a way to put yourself in 
your sister's vampiric shoes.

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,660
The two keys to sibling vampiric relationships,

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,100
Number 1, empathy. Number 2, no biting.

23
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,120
"I hate when you're about to sit on the one seat left on 
the bus but someone takes the seat."

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,620
Right, so the thing to do with that situation is to assume

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:02,320
Even if it's improbable that that person needs 
the seat more than you do.

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,060
It may not be true but it will be very helpful to you 
in terms of keeping sane

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,260
Particularly in like parking lots around Christmas.

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,700
"My clothes dryer just set off my fire alarm. Dear alarm, WORK BETTER!"

29
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,840
Okay, so I'm just going to throw this out there

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,480
I'd be more worried about the dryer than the alarm

31
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,360
Because it seems to me that the alarm is working perfectly.

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,320
"I never know what to do and I always invent a reason not to do stuff."

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,020
Yeah this is a common problem because the easiest thing for us to do

34
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,280
Is the thing that we're currently doing which is usually nothing.

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,300
But I have 3 quick suggestions

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,180
1) Go to an art museum by yourself

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,600
2) Read some poetry

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,840
3)Using Google Maps find a nearby park that has some walking trails

39
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,880
and then walk around them doing amateur birdwatching

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,660
but inventing names for each of the birds you discover.

41
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,160
"MY CAPSLOCK KEY IS BROKEN!"

42
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,120
OH GOD, PANIC! No just kidding. 
If you have a Mac you can disable

43
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,880
your Capslock button in system preferences

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,120
And if you have a PC you should get the free application 'Key Tweak'. Link in the doobly doo.

45
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,560
"I have stairs that have an open space between the steps and I'm scared someone's going to grab my ankles."

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,240
Yeah  I'm not sure I see that as a problem. 
Let's suppose somebody does grab your ankes

47
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,340
All they have is your ankle. You can still reach into your pocket and call 911.

48
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,860
And if in the meantime they want to come get you, they have to come out

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,440
From under the staircase and run up the stairs during which time you can run up the stairs

50
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,740
Lock the door on them and leave them there until the police come.

51
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:13,360
Frankly of all the possible home intruder outcomes, grabbed by the ankle is like the best!

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,840
"The book store in my mall closed down and 
it was replaced by an eyebrow design store."

53
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,820
Wow, that is depressing. I have 2 solutions

54
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,540
First, design your own eyebrows

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,880
And second, buy books at bookstores!

56
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,240
If you want bookstores to exist, support them.

57
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,560
The way that you spend your money shapes the world in which we live.

58
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,980
"Hufflepuff discrimination"

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,040
Yeah I know right but Hufflepuff don't care.

60
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,000
"My problem is a lack of community for beginning writers."

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,540
Check out figment.com. Link in the doobly doo.

62
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,600
"It's much easier to watch from afar than to participate in things."

63
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,220
That's true but it's a lot more fun to participate so here are 3 easy ways to be nerdfightastic

64
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:49,100
1) If you haven't joined Kiva.org, you can still make your first loan to an entrepreneur in the developing world  for free

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,000
There's a link- woah woah woah woah woah- link in the doobly doo.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,540
I almost went down there but I didn't.

67
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,340
2)You can read Fahrenheit 451

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,680
And 3) Why not take a few minutes to respond to some comments? With niceness.

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,460
Being nice is surprisisngly entertaining.

70
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,940
"I have spelling problems that limit how nerdy I can be."

71
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,820
I totally disagree with your premise. My brother is a terrible speller and a tremendous nerd.

72
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,620
"I'm an older Nerdfighter."

73
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,960
Yeah so am I. To help you less alone I have created a facebook group for us. There's a link in the doobly doo.

74
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,680
"I can't find Nerdfighters who live in my area."

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,740
You should look on facebook and the ning and in your pants, context is everything

76
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,480
because there are a lot of location specific Nerdighter  groups.

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,880
"I have a slight fear of being drowned by mermaids."

78
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,620
Aah don't worry about that, you'll be fine.

79
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,080
Well, until the human voices wake you.

80
00:03:29,460 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, I'll see you on Friday.
