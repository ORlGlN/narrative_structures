1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,960
Ugghhh. Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.
It's morning, but I still see the moon and

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,760
that star that you're probably gonna tell
me tomorrow is actually a planet.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,960
Alright, it's a little bit later and I'm in
a better mood now. Plus I'm vlogging from

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,910
the car; that always makes me happy. So Hank,
I really enjoyed your history of the Pizza

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,750
John design, but it made me wonder about the
history of pizza, and also the history of

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,320
Johns.
We're gonna start with the history of pizza,

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,619
but first we have to define what we mean when
we talk about pizza. I mean, we live in an

8
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,920
age of cheeseless pizza, and sauceless pizza,
and none pizza with left beef.

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,040
Now some people say that pizza is just like
bread with toppings, and so they trace it

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,670
back to Ancient Egypt and India and Greece.
But Hank, I think we all know that those people

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:43,829
are wrong, I mean garlic naan is not pizza.
Banana bread is not pizza. Pizza is bread

12
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,989
and tomato sauce and cheese and possibly other.
And by that definition, the history of pizza

13
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,920
becomes a lot more interesting, because for
almost all of human history, pizza was impossible.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,480
Pizza's central ingredients lived in entirely
different worlds, Hank. In the Americas, there

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,438
were delicious tomatoes. And in the rest of
the world, there was wonderful cows' milk

16
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,729
and bread. But then, Christopher Columbus.
Now, Hank, as discussed in this video - and

17
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,539
you will notice my excellent pointing skills.
Anyway, the exchange between the Americas

18
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,950
and the rest of the world that began with
Columbus, in the late fifteenth century, was

19
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:21,380
disastrous for life on Earth in many, many
ways. But it did make pizza possible, and

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,969
also like 90% of the foods that we now eat.
I mean, hamburgers and french fries? There

21
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:29,649
were no cows in the New World, no potatoes
in the Old World. I mean, can you imagine

22
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,789
going to a restaurant and being like, "hey,
can I have a hamburger and French fries?",

23
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:35,359
and them being like, "Well, you can have french
fries, but if you want the hamburger ,you're

24
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:37,950
gonna have to leave the Americas".
Well, among the many New World foods that

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,469
came to the Old World was tomatoes, which
was initially believed to be poisonous, but

26
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,909
it turns out that they are just dangerously
delicious. And by the middle of the sixteenth

27
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,950
century, in Naples, Italy, we had pizza as
we know it today, with cheese, and tomato

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,929
sauce, and bread and possibly other. But like
most things, Hank, pizza didn't actually have

29
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:57,909
an inventor, it had, like, millions of innovators.
Like, for instance, the pizza in sixteenth

30
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:01,840
century Naples tasted very little like pizza
as we know it today. For one thing, it was

31
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,639
sweet, like pizza literally means 'pie'.
So the story of pizza is really a story of,

32
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:10,229
like, humans coming together over thousands
of generations and across continents to invent

33
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,030
the perfect food. And that's what history
is, really, Hank, it's not really about great

34
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,269
individuals, it's this ongoing collaboration
among the ninety six billion or so people

35
00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:22,819
who have lived here.
Alright, Johns! John comes from the Hebrew

36
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,120
name meaning 'God is gracious', and for, like,
a thousand years it was the most popular name

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,359
in England, until, like, I was born and then
suddenly it became less popular. I'm trying

38
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:35,189
not to take that personally. There's a few
minor Johns in the Hebrew Bible, but the Johns

39
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:39,810
really took off in the New Testament. I don't
want to brag, Hank, but there are no Hanks

40
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,689
in the New Testament, and there's some pretty
vital Johns.

41
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,790
Like, there's the itinerant preacher John
the Baptist, Jesus' apostle John... Historians

42
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,670
disagree about whether there are other Johns
in the Bible, and I'm going to steer clear

43
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,459
of that argument because I'm no dummy!
But anyway Hank, the most interesting thing

44
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,010
I learned in my research is that the name
John is not the same name as the name Jonathan.

45
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,700
Jonathan comes from a different Hebrew word
that means 'gift from God', and it's a longer

46
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,150
form not of John, but of Nathan.
So there you have it Hank, a brief history

47
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,069
of pizza and Johns. It happens to be lunchtime.
You'll never guess what I'm having. Hank,

48
00:03:11,069 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you tomorrow.
