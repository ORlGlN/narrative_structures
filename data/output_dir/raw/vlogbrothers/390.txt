00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:05,049
Good morning John, and thanks for making our
most disliked Vlogbrothers video ever!

2
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:07,339
Apparently, all you have to do is insult a
fictional vigilante.

3
00:00:07,339 --> 00:00:12,930
To be fair, though, to everyone in the comments,
you pretty much got Batman entirely wrong.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,600
Bruce Wayne does contribute to the infrastructure
of that fictional, blighted city as much as

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,580
he can, given its deep rooted culture of corruption
that makes it so that there is literally no

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,000
one else in the city who can help.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,330
Except for old guy sidekicks number one and
number two and that woman who isn't Katie

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,350
Holmes and Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg.

9
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,190
Of course I know that your video on Tuesday
wasn't really about Batman.

10
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,290
It was just using Batman as a tool to say
something: that individual people cannot have,

11
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,370
and do not have, and should not have the power
to change everything on their own, and when

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,289
they try to do it, it always turns out bad.

13
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:43,579
So, maybe it's odd that we spend so much time
celebrating that idea in our media.

14
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,039
But, I don't actually think it's odd; I think
it's complicated.

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,750
Batman's values and actions are a reflection
of our own values and actions, or our desires

16
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:57,749
to act, to make the world better... in the
ways that we want it to be better.

17
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:01,399
Of course, then wrapped up in an entertaining
package with great plot and epic explosions

18
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:02,399
and stuff.

19
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,369
We all do know that there is evil in the world,
so Gotham's underbelly simplifies and represents

20
00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:07,369
that for us.

21
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,090
Gotham's criminals aren't a product of disenfranchisement
and undervaluation by culture.

22
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,130
"Some people", as Alfred tells Master Wayne,
"just want to watch the world burn."

23
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,682
So, Batman is a reflection of our anger and
our ambition and our frustration that our

24
00:01:18,682 --> 00:01:21,729
powerlessness to fix the things that we see
is wrong with the world.

25
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:22,729
I think this is fine.

26
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:26,359
Gotham's evil incarnate is a simplification
of the problems that we face, and Batman is

27
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:32,579
a simplification of us, of all of us, who
do the good that makes the world work.

28
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,070
So then, in some peculiar way, we are all
bat-people: not the heroes Earth needs, but

29
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,829
the heroes Earth just happened to get.

30
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:46,090
We build roads and teach children and clean
sewers and invent new kinds of lightbulbs

31
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,299
and care for each other and better ourselves.

32
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,749
It's a simple vigilantism: the vigilantism
of everyday kindness and hard work.

33
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:57,060
Of course, Batman is a more complex simplification
than, say, Superman, who is so simple that

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,729
he's really not even relatable.

35
00:01:58,729 --> 00:02:03,950
We see ourselves in the cracks in his faÃ§ade,
in his anger and frustration and sadness,

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,130
because we have all those things, too.

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,410
And for this reflection to work, to sell the
most movie tickets -we're talking about the

38
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,690
movies here, not the comics- Batman has to
be as broadly representative as possible,

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,500
so his values are just kind of an average
amalgam of the values of our culture.

40
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,720
And his major characteristics of being hot
and buff and rich and white and male are either

41
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,540
things that we see as unquestionably advantageous
in things that we ourselves would like to

42
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,750
be, or, as like, the default state, which
is I think where we start running into trouble.

43
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,300
My biggest problem with Batman, and to be
fair, all of the mass-cultural movie things

44
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,130
that we spend billions of dollars creating
and marketing, is that in an attempt to represent

45
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,280
most broadly, they continue to under-represent
the same groups over and over and over and

46
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
over again!

47
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,080
In attempting to reflect our culture and its
weird emphasis on maleness and whiteness as

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,350
the default, they don't just submit to that
culture, they help reinforce it, they help

49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,730
create it, somehow leaving the majority of
people under-represented in a simplification

50
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,060
that had representation as its initial goal,
which is pretty messed up.

51
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,000
So yeah, it's complicated.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
All simplicity is a lie!

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,860
And we could do a better job.

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,630
And in comics, they do a better job.

55
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,800
Because the comics don't cost 500 million
dollars to make and thus can take some risks,

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,660
which is why that's where all the interesting
stuff happens.

57
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,630
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

58
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,630
It's October 10th, which means that it's time
to start thinking about the Project for Awesome,

59
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,630
people.

60
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,630
We're working on some very cool perks.

61
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,310
One of the things is a compilation album of
nerdfighter music; anything inspired by anything

62
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,310
to do with nerdfighteria.

63
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,500
If you wold like to contribute to that compilation
album, there is some information in the description.

64
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,360
What's happening over on Games with Hank?

65
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,540
UH-OH I'M SORRY DOLPHIN MOM!

66
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,540
That is a jellyfish!

67
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,460
Ohh, woahh, look at me goo!

68
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,140
Everyone's a winner... until their legs break
in half.

69
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,290
No...

70
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:49,600
NoOO- AAA-HAAAAAA!

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,950
Yeah, it-- it's fun.

72
00:03:52,950 --> 00:00:00,000
You should come visit.
