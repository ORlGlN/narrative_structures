00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,255
Good morning, Hank. It's Thursday, August 3, 2017.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,780
It's Esther Day!

3
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:05,640
So 7 years ago today,

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,440
our friend Esther Earl made a video where she said in part,

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,720
"...and I love my sisters, I love my brother,

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,420
I love my dad, I love my mom, and I love my pets. They are included

7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,180
in the family category.

8
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,040
I love my friends. My friends are amazing.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,000
The ones I've met online. The ones that I still have IRL."

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,660
Esther died a few weeks later when she was just 16.

11
00:00:25,665 --> 00:00:28,215
And every year we pause on August 3,

12
00:00:28,215 --> 00:00:30,705
her birthday, to celebrate Esther Day,

13
00:00:30,705 --> 00:00:33,795
a celebration of love in all its many splendors.

14
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:36,825
And Esther wanted us to pay special attention to the kinds of non-romantic love

15
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:39,140
that often go unacknowledged in our culture,

16
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,100
love among family and friends.

17
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,440
So Hank, with that noted, I love you.

18
00:00:43,445 --> 00:00:46,225
I so admire your hard work, your relentless pursuit

19
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:48,840
of decreasing world suck, your love and kindness

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,580
and patience as a son and father

21
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:53,400
and husband and brother.

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,480
I think you're amazing, and I love you. And I will not say that again for a year.

23
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,040
In honor of Esther Day, I hope all of you out there will take a moment

24
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,780
to tell people in your lives that you love them,

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,860
even if it's hard to do, in fact, especially if it's hard to do.

26
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,925
After Esther died, her family created This Star Won't Go Out,

27
00:01:08,925 --> 00:01:12,280
a charity that has helped many, many families of kids with cancer.

28
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,135
But this Esther Day, This Star Won't Go Out

29
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:16,555
is expanding its mission in a way Esther would have loved

30
00:01:16,555 --> 00:01:19,215
with something called Project Lovely.

31
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:21,405
That logo, by the way, was made by Emily Cole, using

32
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:23,845
a font made from Esther's actual handwriting.

33
00:01:23,845 --> 00:01:26,180
So you can find out much more about this at ProjectLovely.org,

34
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,020
but basically people between the ages of 13 and 30 can

35
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,420
apply for a $5000 grant,

36
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:33,720
to do something to make the world better.

37
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,240
It can be anything that will make the world better.

38
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,220
You can apply at ProjectLovely.org.

39
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,720
Two people will be chosen and given $5000,

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,880
and then we'll follow their projects.

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,300
Esther loved the Project for Awesome and Harry Potter Alliance initiatives,

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,300
and I think this is a really beautiful way for her family and friends

43
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,960
to continue her legacy.

44
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,300
And if you want to donate to This Star Won't Go Out, you can do so at TSWGO.org.

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,100
I also highly recommend Esther's memoir, "This Star Won't Go Out."

46
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,740
It's a beautiful book available wherever books are sold.

47
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:02,580
Thanks to Esther and her amazing family for continuing to inspire our community.

48
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,280
Happy Esther Day everybody!

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,400
Hank, I look forward to saying, "I love you," again

50
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,600
in just 365 short days.

51
00:02:08,604 --> 00:00:00,000
I will see you tomorrow.
