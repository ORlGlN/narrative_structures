00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,420
Good morning John, it is September 19th.

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,340
And it is also Wednesday.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,060
This song is about Katherine Green.

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,520
That was the wrong chord.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,500
I've come across a lot of ten dollar bills in my time

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,380
In swimming pools and taxi seats and ATMs and on the beach

7
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:43,340
Finding free money is something I can do

8
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:48,660
But when I think about my luck I only think of you

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah sure when I go downtown I find the perfect parking spot

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,160
Ok I guess the right answers on my tests a lot

11
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,500
And yeah when I fell out of that cypress tree I didn't die

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:17,000
But you my girl are the luck of my life yeah you my girl are the luck of my life

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,800
Once we met this guy on the way to a punk rock show

14
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,500
And we helped with some boxes

15
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Even though we didn't know that he was with the band

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,500
And he got us in free

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,300
But the only reason I felt lucky is you were there with me

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:44,800
Yeah sure that light turned green before I hit the break

19
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,500
Ok no one notices half of the mistakes I make

20
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,300
And yeah when I ate that rat poison I didn't die

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,000
But you my girl are the luck of my life

22
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,500
Yeah you my girl are the luck of my life

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,500
Yeah ten thousand people watch me online each week

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,500
Ok no one has ever had a cooler job than me

25
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
But one day one girl said that she'd be my wife

26
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:29,000
And that day was the luckiest of my life

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah you my girl are the luck of my life

28
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,360
Happy Anniversary, Katherine.

29
00:02:51,380 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you tomorrow.
