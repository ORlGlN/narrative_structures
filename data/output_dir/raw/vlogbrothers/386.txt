00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,130
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,130
The world is fascinating.

3
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:06,049
You can take pretty much anything in the world
and drill down far enough to find convoluted

4
00:00:06,049 --> 00:00:07,830
tales of hilarity and intrigue.

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,740
We're gonna do that right now... with this.

6
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,960
The pound sign, the number sign, the hash
symbol, different names in different countries,

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,960
and understandably.

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,280
In America, a shifted three on a standard
keyboard is called a pound sign.

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,320
In the UK, a shifted three on a standard keyboard
is also called a pound sign, but they are

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,660
completely different characters, what the
frick?

11
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,800
Weirdly enough, they actually both have the
same origin: the Latin phrase for weight,

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
libra pondo.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,800
It's the same reason that pound is abbreviated
lb.

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,119
Despite the fact that that is super dumb.

15
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,030
Now in the middle of the last millennium,
bookkeepers would scribble so fast while they

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,140
were writing down weights that lb started
to look like maybe it was a 16, they weren't

17
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,319
quite sure, it was unclear, so they started
to cross the top of the lb.

18
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,979
Their frantic scribbling intensified to the
point where it started to look like this.

19
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:50,079
And that there is the missing link between
this, and this.

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,239
However, this symbol had pretty much fallen
completely out of use until the end of the

21
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,399
19th century.

22
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,780
That's when the Teletype Corporation was inventing
binary codes for the transmission of letters.

23
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,159
In the UK, the symbol code for the pound sign
was 10111.

24
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,409
But in the US, because apparently we don't
need pound signs or even want to look at them,

25
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:12,420
they decided to make that pound sign not the
UK pound currency symbol, but the old, obsolete

26
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,450
pound sign.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,310
This is the moment where the magic happened.

28
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,520
Because this symbol didn't actually mean very
much, it started to become a catchall symbol

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,390
for when someone needed a non-confusing symbol
for something.

30
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,500
This is probably how it became known as the
number sign, you put it before a number to

31
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,600
indicate that the number is a number.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,899
Which is so extremely non-useful that I refuse
to accept that this thing is called a number

33
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:32,899
sign.

34
00:01:32,899 --> 00:01:33,899
I know it's a number because it's a number!

35
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:37,180
Next step in the process: Bell Labs is developing
touch tone phones in the 1960s.

36
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,259
The engineers at Bell Labs see the potential
for phones to control machines and computers,

37
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:44,560
so they want to add two extra buttons that
aren't numbers that can be used for those

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
purposes.

39
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,390
Originally, it was a five-pointed star and
a diamond, but the engineers at the company

40
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,060
insisted that it be a character that was in
the newly created ASCII Code System.

41
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,479
And neither of those symbols were in there.

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,590
After much deliberation, they went with the
asterisk which looked a lot like the star

43
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:02,819
and the kinda unnamed symbol in question because
it wasn't really being used for anything else,

44
00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:03,819
so it wasn't confusing.

45
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:08,389
So, it was included on phones, and remarkably
enough if I go to the keypad, it's still on

46
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,389
there!

47
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,200
Because it was used by Bell Labs on their
phones, it became a standard, culturally understood

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,140
symbol so much so that it was included on
the standard American keyboard.

49
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,180
Once again, in place of the British Pound
sign, despite the fact that there was not

50
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,530
really any good use for it.

51
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,930
Now the engineers at Bell Labs in the sixties
seemed to have recognized that there wasn't

52
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,790
a good name for this thing because in their
manuals that they distributed to different

53
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,550
people about how to use their devices, occasionally
when referring to this sign, they would have

54
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:40,030
a little footnote that would say "also sometimes
known as an octothorpe" or possibly octatherp.

55
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,680
This was a joke, an Easter egg, but it actually
for a couple of decades caught on in the engineering

56
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,180
community because engineers love jargon, and
because, I mean in my opinion at least, octothorpe

57
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,170
is a better word than any of the other options.

58
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,760
Now you might argue that with the arrival
of the social media hashtag, another use by

59
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,950
the way made possible by the symbols prevalence
without having a particular use.

60
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,671
Hash sign seems the logical way to go; that's
what it's called in most of the world, though

61
00:03:02,671 --> 00:03:05,370
in America we still say pound sign even though
that's terribly confusing.

62
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,860
But for those of us who would rather have
our language defined by cheeky nerds of the

63
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,620
1960s than by the whims of social media, for
us, we'll always have octothorpe!

64
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:21,760
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,900
Good news everyone, after like a year of working
on this, we have launched a new DFTBA.com

66
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,700
merch store.

67
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,530
It's prettier and more functional and you
don't have to use PayPal and you can buy posters

68
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,760
and shirts at the same time.

69
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,060
We've just launched a few new designs, one
of them I've had to blur a little bit.

70
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,360
And one of them is a pre-order for all my
octothorpe lovers out there.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Represent.

72
00:03:40,360 --> 00:00:00,000
Hashtag octothorpe!
