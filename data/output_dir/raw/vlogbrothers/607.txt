1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,520
All: Good morning, Hank! It's Tuesday!

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,460
John: So, Hank, a couple weeks ago I was in Washington, D.C.,

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,340
meeting 1,800 people on the national mall approximately

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,640
here, where I returned Sunday for a slightly quieter day.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,880
Sarah's organizing a stop

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,320
on the tour of the Chinese artist

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,320
Ai Weiwei's show, "According to What?"

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,360
and so we came to the American opening of the show,

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,000
which Ai Weiwei couldn't attend

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,580
on account of the Chinese government refusing to give him a passport.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,360
In this famous triptych, Ai dropped a Han Dynasty urn

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,200
and let it smash to the ground.

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,700
That morning we went over to a sculpture park

14
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,960
featuring a house that reminded me

15
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,260
of the insufficiency of human

16
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,040
eyes, and a fake tree by Roxy Paine that was real enough for birds.

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,840
The Yeti and I sat down on a park bench,

18
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,160
and she fed me popcorn, which was adorable,

19
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,960
and then disaster struck.

20
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,140
This squirrel is inadequately afraid of humans!

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,760
Squirrel... I am a threat to you!

22
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,640
We are enemies!

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,940
Please get off my bench! Oh, God!

24
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,620
Oh, God! Don't touch me—oh, God!

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,160
John: Then we briefly went back to the hotel so that I could recover.

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,680
That's a lot of president heads.

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,560
John: Before walking down to the national mall.

28
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,960
Am I wearing skinny jeans? Oh my God, I am.

29
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,140
Our nation's capital has a lot of neoclassical architecture.

30
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:14,700
It's all stone and columns and intimidating facades.

31
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,840
These buildings give the appearance of something between a church and

32
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,220
a fort, which I guess is what governments are.

33
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,340
I mean, even the freaking bathrooms are intimidating.

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,280
This astonishingly impressive building, for instance?

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,460
It's the Department of freaking Agriculture headquarters!

36
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,420
♫ Lone bird perched atop the Department of Agriculture,

37
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:38,280
thanks for watching over our nation's grain. ♫

38
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,040
Right, so we walked down to the Washington Monument

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,500
and noted the metaphorically resonant fact

40
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,660
that the U.S. Capitol stares out at Washington, who in turn stares back at Congress,

41
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,480
a symbol made all the more obvious by the fact that to keep airplanes away,

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,800
the Washington Monument now has terrifying blinking red lights,

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,700
like the triangular-faced Washington

44
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,560
is staring at Congress with his blinking, devil, red eyes saying,

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,540
"YOU ARE NOT WHAT I HAD IN MIND."

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,860
We walked further and found ourselves

47
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,720
at the very moving World War II Memorial,

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,660
about halfway between Washington and Lincoln,

49
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,840
whom, I noticed, were also staring at each other in much the same way

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,500
that Washington and the Capitol were,

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,880
which made me think about the fact that even though we think of

52
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,960
Washington and Lincoln belonging to different historical epochs,

53
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,440
in fact, Lincoln was born just 10 years

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,800
after Washington died.

55
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,560
TOUR BUS, I AM TRYING TO CONSIDER THE RELATIVE YOUTH OF OUR NATION,

56
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,640
AND YOU ARE RUINING IT.

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,760
Anyway, then we saw a boat that was also a car.

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,620
Hank, it will no doubt not surprise you to learn that the inventor of

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,340
the boat-car — car-boat? — boat-car —

60
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,260
The inventor of the boat-car was Oliver Evans, an American who designed the first

61
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,080
steam-powered amphibious vehicle in 1805.

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,610
John: So we're going to the National Museum of American History.

63
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,480
What are your feelings

64
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,760
on American history?

65
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,760
Sarah: Mmm...

66
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,140
Sarah: Mmmm... I'm...

67
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,860
mixed.

68
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,180
John: We saw Abe Lincoln's hat and some excellent presidential pajamas

69
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,780
and Dumbo, but mostly it was just this exhibit,

70
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,200
which explained that we have been at war,

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,260
to some degree or another, pretty much constantly for the last 250 years.

72
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,860
All right, Sarah, now that we've left, how do you feel about the United States?

73
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Sarah: Still mixed.

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,580
John: Then we walked over to the national gallery of art,

75
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,780
where we saw a Jackson Pollock,

76
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,320
and a room full of Calders and a Chuck Close painting

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,900
that, upon closer inspection, was made of fingerprints.

78
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,180
And it occurred to me that everything we'd done that day was available to all people for free.

79
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,700
It struck me that once you got inside the temple-fortresses of neoclassicism,

80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,160
the American ideas of equal opportunity and equal access still live.

81
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,720
So I guess I share Sarah's mixed feelings about U.S. History,

82
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,660
but more than that,

83
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,200
I feel like it's just too soon to say.

84
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,320
Hank, as I walked around this city of monuments meant to evoke our history,

85
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,000
I couldn't stop thinking that

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,180
for better or worse,

87
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,440
the United States is just getting started.

88
00:03:43,060 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on Friday.
