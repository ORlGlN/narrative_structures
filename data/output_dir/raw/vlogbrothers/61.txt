00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,800
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,800
A couple of months ago, Mom told me a story that I want to tell you right now, but first, a little bit of context.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,840
She grew up in Birmingham, Alabama during
segregation.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,480
Interracial marriage was illegal; there were different schools for black kids and white kids.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,360
Racism wasn’t called racism because it’s
just the way the world was.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,000
And of course, a lot changed for her in the
70s as the civil rights movement happened,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,900
as she went to college, but here’s the story she told me.

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:30,200
After our family moved to Orlando, she was surprised to find that we would be taught in school by black teachers.

9
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:35,100
Like, she’d gotten to a place where of course schools would be integrated, there would be black kids in school with us,

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,040
but that the teachers would be black, she said, was a surprise,

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,900
and she worried (and she wasn’t the only
person in her friend group that worried about this) that black teachers wouldn’t be able to teach us as well as white teachers.

12
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:53,640
When I asked Mom if it was okay for me to share that anecdote, I think it says a lot about her that she said that it was okay,

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,280
'cause obviously this does not make her look good.

14
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
She didn’t bring this up for like 25 years.

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,260
It is hard to talk about race, and I think
that we need to do it more.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,860
So she wanted me to. She wanted to help me talk about it. She wanted to help us talk about it.

17
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,100
And I feel uncomfortable talking about race.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,640
I worry that I’m going to do something wrong, that I’m gonna hurt somebody, but I wanna do it because it’s important,

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,320
and I think it’s in service of the world that I hope we’re creating.

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,540
I think a lot of white people in America think it is rude or even racist to even notice race.

21
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:27,200
Black people that I know, on the other hand, have a really hard time imagining a world in which race is not a normal topic of conversation.

22
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,680
Racism in America continues to be very real.

23
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,900
There’s overwhelming data that shows that it affects many facets of people’s lives,

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,300
and not needing to think about or talk about racism is an advantage that I have because I'm white.

25
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:45,040
But the fact that I don’t really need to
think about racism is on the list of the many good reasons why I should be thinking about it.

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,060
Ultimately, unlike some of my classmates,
Mom kept us in the classes that we were assigned to.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,820
And I don’t want to make it sound like that’s some kind of heroic decision,

28
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,040
but I also don’t want it to sound like she was a monster for having those thoughts in the first place.

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,660
The point, for me, is that she wasn’t a
hero, she wasn’t a monster, but that I can still be proud of her.

30
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:04,640
When I was talking to her about all this,
she said something that I thought was really important.

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
She said, “Hate is so easy.”

32
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,840
That Nelson Mandela quote is true.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,120
No one is born hating another person because of the color of their skin.

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,660
But I also think that tribalism is innate,
that we find it much easier to be empathetic toward people who are like us, however we define that.

35
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,720
And in America, we have a long, consistent history of not defining black people as “like us,"

36
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,820
as oppressing black people, and that
tradition runs right up to today.

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,520
The work to break down our innate tribalism, to live in productive diversity, to expand our sphere of empathy is work.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,940
And that work that has been done in America is progress. There has been progress.

39
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:48,280
But when people say, “This is not America,” no, it is America.

40
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,500
But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love
this country.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,280
Because the great story of human progress isn’t just a story of science and technology,

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,240
it’s the story of increasing tolerance,
increasing diversity and human-to-human understanding,

43
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,020
and that is not an event, it is a process.

44
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,720
This is America.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,760
And this is also America.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:12,040
We are not done, and we will not finish in
my lifetime, but like all great human endeavors,

47
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,660
if it’s gonna be done before you die, it’s
too small a goal.

48
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,920
But in my life, I wanna get better at listening. I wanna get better at talking.

49
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,880
I wanna get better at understanding the gifts that I’ve been given and using them wisely.

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,200
I wanna read more diverse books, and I wanna learn from our mom, John.

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,980
Learn that beliefs can change, that empathy can grow,

52
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:36,400
and that we are never done with the hard, lifelong work of bringing about a world that is more compassionate, tolerant, and just.

53
00:03:36,400 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I’ll see you on Tuesday.
