00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Good Morning John

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,220
I wanna make a really complicated video today.

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,500
Something that was just like awesome and epic

4
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,400
But I just .. I just don't have time.

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,760
And it's even not because I'm busy

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,760
It's just like ..

7
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,780
That was fun

8
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
Story behind that..

9
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,760
..uh.. There's a channel..

10
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,760
..on YouTube called AVBYTE

11
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
When I was talking about how obssessed I am with Instagram

12
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,600
Somebody linked me to their Instagram Musical

13
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,740
And then I loved it. And then ..

14
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,460
.. I loved everything else that they've done

15
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,680
A new musical .. On YouTube.. Every week

16
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,900
How amazing is that!

17
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,020
So yeah, I emailed them and I was like

18
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,920
.. we should do one about Tumblr and I should be in it

19
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,900
We wrote the lyrics together

20
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,580
They did the music

21
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,320
We did the video

22
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,140
It was not... It was a long process

23
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,840
Not kidding

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,480
74 emails were exchanged in the preparation of this

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:49,980
That's a lot

26
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,840
I hope you enjoyed it

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,680
So then the next couple of weeks are gonna be kinda intense for me

28
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,500
Going on tour with Harry and the Potters very briefly

29
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,020
Again, Oregon and Washington people

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,200
If you wanna come see us play there's dates in the dooblydoo

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,520
And then I get a couple days back in Missoula

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
And then i"m going to Leekycon

33
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,660
And during that time

34
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,280
It's sort of like the rush up to the landing of the Mars Science Laboratory

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,140
Which is .. just a really intense for me

36
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,220
I just made a video about it

37
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,320
It's gonna go live on SciShow this weekend and ..

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm so scared

39
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,500
and excited

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,900
It's just, oof..

41
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,900
I should do a musical about that

42
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,080
Oh also. John thanks for talking about my buffness

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,440
So now everybody wants to like see me with my shirt off

44
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,800
which would be a tremendously unimpressive experience for everyone

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,580
I promise

46
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,540
Hope you liked the song

47
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,380
It's not on iTunes yet

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,240
But it will be shortly

49
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,100
I'll tweet that and

50
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,920
Of course I'll put it on my Tumblr

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,040
And if you haven't experienced Tumblr

52
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,280
It is a weird

53
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,700
but very fun place

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,340
Try not to spend your whole life there

55
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,620
Go do other things

56
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,980
Outside things even

57
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,080
with your computer though

58
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:45,740
Bring your computer

59
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,880
And spin around in circles

60
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,940
Like that. That's nice

61
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,440
Good

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,340
John, I'm excited to see you at Leakycon but first

63
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,200
I will see you on Monday

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,480
Oh my God

65
00:03:54,500 --> 00:00:00,000
This is way hotter than the last time I was on this dish
