00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
Good morning John.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,380
The election here in America is tomorrow.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,460
And we've talked about the elections every video for the last like four videos.

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,360
And I'm sure you're gonna talk about it tomorrow.

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,380
So today I want to tell you a story.

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,640
One of the best kind of stories in all of the different kinds of stories. Hot spicy summer camp stories.

7
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,740
Now, you're probably jumping to some conclusions right now.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,480
The first one being that at the time of the story I was a camper with little or no experience in the ways of the world.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,500
But you'd be wrong. This actually happened while I was a counselor at the summer camp.

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,100
Though I'm happy to say there are no campers involved.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:36,060
And you might be thinking that this story is gonna take place in one of the cabins or deep in the forest.

12
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,180
In a starry night or at least you know like on the tennis court after dark.

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,380
But no, it happened in the kitchen.

14
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:49,100
Maybe you're imagining me and some starry eyed brunette on the painted white tables in the cafeteria,

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,140
As the winds of a summer storm howled outside.

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,860
But no, there were actually like twelve other people there.

17
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,960
And at the end of the night I fell asleep with an ice cube on my lips.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,080
So are you ready?

19
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,960
It was late at night. A steamy august night.

20
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,739
A bunch of counselors and I were not on duty. And we had put the campers to sleep.

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,320
And what do you do when you are an off duty counselor and all your kids are asleep?

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,000
You raid the kitchen. That's what you do.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,720
Sometimes you find like leftover desserts or entrees from that evenings dinner.

24
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,780
But no such luck on this night. We just had chips and salsa.

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,740
Which is fine because I like chips and I'm okay with salsa.

26
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,860
Actually at that time, I wasn't a huge salsa fan  because I didn't like spicy stuff at all.

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,680
Huge spice wuss.

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,460
And also all the chunks in salsa. Like anything that might contain actual nutritious value.

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,620
I didn't like that either.

30
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,860
So basically my strategy was to try and get like the flavour of the salsa on the chip.

31
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,460
Without getting any actual chunks on the chip.

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,740
So just getting the liquid on it.

33
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,060
But by favorite possible outcome in a salsa chip dipping situation.

34
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,560
Is that there has been a chip that has been sitting around in the salsa for a long time.

35
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,260
Like an oreo soakin' up all the milk. Chippy goody salsa goodness chip.

36
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,900
Kind of soggy. And I know that sounds gross. But I really like it.

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,060
So when I spotted a chip like covered in salsa in the salsa bowl. I was super excited about this.

38
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,100
So I scooped it on up with an other chip and I popped the whole thing in my mouth.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,540
What I did not know was the story of this chip.

40
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,260
It had a long story. It used to be corn for example. That was a long time ago in the history of the chip.

41
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,440
But more recently that chip had been used by a fellow counselor who thought that the salsa was not spicy enough.

42
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,860
So he had doused the chip with a kind of novelty hot sauce the kind of hot sauce that says on the label "Do not

43
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,420
use more than one or two drops at a time."

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,180
This bottle of hot sauce contains 92,000 servings of hot sauce. And it's like this big.

45
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:37,980
The kind of hot sauce that's named like !@#$ blaster or Satan's revenge.

46
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,440
The kind of hot sauce that measures hotness in mega tons. And comes in bottles shaped like coffins.

47
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,400
And lists insanity as the first ingredient.

48
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,640
That kind of hot sauce. He had put on the chip and swirled around into the salsa.

49
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:55,140
And I had taken that chip that was soaked in this death sauce.

50
00:02:55,180 --> 00:03:02,340
And I put it in my mouth and I chewed and I swished it around and then I turned 80 differnt colours

51
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,540
And I almost died.

52
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,540
By the end of the night I had poured a gallon of milk into a bowl and I was putting my face into it.

53
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,340
Because it spread out of my mouth. Insert head into milk and breathe milk.

54
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,120
I was in the walk in refrigerator pushing my face against things. Just like licking it.

55
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:25,820
After I finally gave up on trying to make the pain subside, I just left with a giant cup full of ice.

56
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,740
Went back to my cabin. Laid down with ice in my mouth and on my lips and eventually fell asleep.

57
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,660
When I woke up my mouth was still burning.

58
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:37,540
And the moral of this story is: vote! If you can.

59
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,560
Remember take a picture of yourself at your polling place or with a ballot.

60
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,140
And we will send you a free DFTVA sticker. And please make sure that everyone you know votes as well.

61
00:03:46,160 --> 00:00:00,000
This is the one time a year when it's okay to be a little bit obnoxious. John, I'll see you tomorrow.
