1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,290
Good morning, John!

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,310
This is officially weird.

3
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,310
Pizzamas!

4
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:05,310
Lots of videos!

5
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,099
Not only here, but Five Nights at Freddie’s
2 just came out which is a sequel to a video

6
00:00:09,099 --> 00:00:10,150
game that I like a lot.

7
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,369
So I’ve been playing that, editing those,
and uploading them on Games with Hank.

8
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,820
Fair warning, they’re a little scary.

9
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,070
Not that I mind any of this of course.

10
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,070
I love it!

11
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,070
I love Pizzamas!

12
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,080
We have an official lyricist in the comments
and an official emoji combination.

13
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,360
More weird Pizza John things are being created
all the time; it's just a good feeling.

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,390
But I realized, in reading the comments to
my last video, that I kind of jumped into

15
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,630
this Pizzamas thing and a lot of people were
a little bit left behind.

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,989
If you have no idea what Pizzamas is, raise
your hand.

17
00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:35,989
I don’t really know either.

18
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:38,540
But let’s do a brief history of the Pizza
John here.

19
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,940
Back in 2010, John and Hank Green would do
BlogTV shows.

20
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,600
That was a live streaming platform that doesn’t
exist anymore.

21
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,140
John, a very busy guy, would often eat during
them because he didn’t have any other time

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,579
to do live streams, so he'd do it during dinner.

23
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,930
Nerdfighters started making fun of him.

24
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,280
They made a Facebook group which was just
pictures of John eating stuff.

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,540
Everyone thought this was funny, including
John Green.

26
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:03,570
One of the central things to this entire project
for me has been that you can do serious things,

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,439
and also do silly things, and those things
are not contradictory.

28
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,920
The thing that we want to avoid largely is
not seeming like people.

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Hi!

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,920
I'm a person!

31
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,850
You just gotta hit yourself in the head with
a remote control sometimes.

32
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,850
That’s Puppycat.

33
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:17,850
I hit Puppycat.

34
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,740
This bell calls down an intergalactic Temp-bot,
played by Hannah Hart.

35
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,290
If you haven’t seen Bee and Puppycat yet,
you need to see Bee and Puppycat right now,

36
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,290
it is so good.

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,970
The world is complicated, and understanding
it is important.

38
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,549
But if you don’t have a good time, you’re
not gonna have a good time.

39
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,119
And you can quote me on that.

40
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:37,259
So in 2011, when you made a video Pakistan
while shaving your Movember beard slowly and

41
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,450
somewhat grotesquely, it culminated in like
3 seconds of you having a mustache.

42
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,450
John: MMMMMustache!

43
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,450
And crazy eyes and big hair.

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,541
A nerdfighter took a screencap of that, put
it up on the internet, people laughed at it.

45
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,630
And then another nerdfighter, Valerie2776,
who now works for us as our community manager,

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,810
did like some contrast stuff, traced it in
Illustrator, made it white on red, and that

47
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,810
was Pizza John.

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,810
She put it up on her blog.

49
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,380
John, you saw it and you said this:

50
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,320
John: I don’t know why I love that, but
I know I want it as a shirt.

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,680
And so we put it on a shirt.

52
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,950
And some people bought it.

53
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,329
Not a lot of people, but some people.

54
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:13,110
But this Pizza John face is so like weird
and recognizable and bold and somehow fitting

55
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,430
into the nerd aesthetic in a way that you
don’t really understand.

56
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,691
And also requiring just a little bit of bravery
to even wear in public that it became kind

57
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:21,830
of like a nerdfighter badge.

58
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,690
Pizza John shows up in a lot of places, and
it's pretty cool to see him showing up in

59
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,690
a lot of places.

60
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,790
Why Pizza John?

61
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,890
How did it happen?

62
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,890
I don’t know.

63
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,960
Things like this happen and we want to explain
them, but we can’t.

64
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,330
And really, if we could It would be less special.

65
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,830
So what is Pizza John?

66
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,830
Why is Pizza John?

67
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,830
I don’t know.

68
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,950
I don’t...I don’t know.

69
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,471
In any case, a few years ago, we decided that
Pizza John is popular enough that we’d make

70
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:47,250
some new Pizza Johns that would be limited
edition designs of Pizza John.

71
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,130
We called it Pizzamas, and that was that.

72
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,130
There were no extra videos.

73
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,880
Then last year we did it again, except instead
of with different designs, we did it with

74
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
different products.

75
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:58,070
Now we’re doing it again with both different
designs AND different products.

76
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:01,030
And also extra Vlogbrothers videos.

77
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:04,050
We just want more; we just want to experience
it a little more deeply.

78
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,450
And also remember that it’s been a long
time.

79
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,500
And that things have changed a lot, but not
the important things.

80
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,480
This is a video project between two brothers
talking to each other, even though their lives

81
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,170
now are a lot weirder than they used to be.

82
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:18,900
And it's a community of people who have some
shared values.

83
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,810
Valuing equality, and the knowledge that the
world is complicated and it deserves to be

84
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,970
understood complexly.

85
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,431
Sometimes people ask me how long I'm going
to be doing this for, like what’s your five

86
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:28,431
year plan?

87
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:29,431
Where you going from here?

88
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:30,431
Kind of thing.

89
00:03:30,431 --> 00:03:31,431
And I'm like ‘Are…are you kidding?

90
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:32,990
I will be doing this forever!’

91
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,030
That’s the plan.

92
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,140
81 year old Hank.

93
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,130
Toothless, mumbling about Pizzamas 2061.

94
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,380
I'll see you then.

95
00:03:40,380 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I’ll see you tomorrow.
