1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,110
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:04,240
Today's video is like A Song of Ice and Fire;
it comes to you in three parts, unless its

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,009
creator decides midway through to expand it
dramatically.

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,730
Along the way, I'm going to update you on
the Bank of Nerdfighteria, the unstoppable

5
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:13,849
force that is AFC Wimbledon, the immovable
object that is world suck, and a little something

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:14,849
I did 10 years ago.

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,150
Oh my god, I am so old.

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,110
But let's delay the midlife crisis portion
of the program, and start with part one: Batman.

9
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,800
So, pretty much everything I said about Batman
in my last video, Hank, was either wrong or

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
dramatically oversimplified.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,011
And in the wake of that Hank, it occurred
to me that being wrong is one of the most

12
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:34,130
complicated pleasures I know of, because of
course, initially, I felt defensive, and then

13
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,130
very embarrassed.

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,790
But then I started to think about the fact
that the way I look at the world can still

15
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,610
be changed by the people I look at the world
with, which is exciting because it means I'm

16
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,170
not, like, finished.

17
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,610
And that's good news for an incredibly old
person.

18
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,610
Part two.

19
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,610
Why am I wearing a suit?

20
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,880
Oh, it must be time for the bank of Nerdfighteria's
semi-annual report!

21
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,381
Hank, the bank of Nerdfighteria is like Tyler
Oakley: it has two arms, the lending arm and

22
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,381
the giving arm.

23
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:57,381
Let's start with the lending arm.

24
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:01,850
Over at Kiva.org, Nerdfighters have now loaned
more than 4.5 million dollars to entrepreneurs

25
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,940
in the developing world.

26
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,489
That's amazing; we're one of the biggest groups
in Kiva's history, but the growth has been

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,420
slowing down a little bit in the last couple
month, so if you have 25 dollars or more that

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,220
you can loan to a developing world entrepreneur,
join the Kiva Nerdfighter group!

29
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,220
There's a link in the dooblydoo.

30
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,710
There's a 99% chance that you'll get payed
back which is like a negative 1% interest

31
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,050
rate savings account, which is basically the
same interest rate as they're offering in

32
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,050
banks.

33
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,050
Then there's part three: the giving arm.

34
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:27,150
So Hank, Nerfighteria has an actual, like,
federally sanctioned tax deductible called

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,780
the Foundation to Decrease World Suck.

36
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,320
It gathers money mostly around the Project
for Awesome and gives it all away to charities.

37
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,530
But this year, the Foundation to Decrease
World Suck has been unusually active outside

38
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,530
the P4A.

39
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,159
Like we raised over 300,000 dollars for Water.org's
work in Ethiopa and over 90,000 dollars for

40
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,970
sarcoma research during my silly World Cup
fundraiser.

41
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,920
And right now, partly thanks to Nerdfighter
projects like Minecrfteria, partly thanks

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,870
to the fact that more Vogbrothers income is
going into the Foundation, we have about 45,000

43
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,870
dollars in the bank.

44
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:56,720
That's a great start - going into the Project
for Awesome, we're in our best shape ever.

45
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,970
Part four: my suit isn't all business.

46
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:03,390
So Hank, I play FIFA as AFC Wimbeldon, and
then the ad revenue from Hankgames goes to

47
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,420
sponsor the actual AFC Wimbeldon.

48
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,929
They're this fourth tier English club formed
by its fans after their club was stolen from

49
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,580
them and moved to Milton Keynes.

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,930
And this year, our sponsorship has allowed
us to be on their shorts!

51
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,910
I know what you're wondering: if the shorts
are up here, what's down there?

52
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,970
That's none of your business!

53
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,780
Anyway Hank, two weeks ago, MY AFC Wimbeldon
beat Milton Keynes; in a thrilling foreign

54
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,890
four-nil victory, Bald John Green did the
mustache of joy!

55
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:31,030
And then last week, the ACTUAL AFC Wimbeldon
played the ACTUAL Milton Keynes AND THE BALL

56
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,670
COMES IN TO AKINFENWA!

57
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,670
AKINFENWA!

58
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,670
AKINFENWAAA!

59
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,700
And AFC Wimbeldon emerged victorious as the
crowd chanted "Who were you, who were you,

60
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,650
who were you when you were us."

61
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,420
Clearly Hank, having DFTBA on your shorts
leads to athletic success.

62
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:45,800
Wait a second, why am I number 37?

63
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,680
[Gasp] It's because I am 37 years old, oh
my god.

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,020
Which brings me nicely to part five.

65
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,530
So Hank, ten years ago today, I had just finished
the last edits on this little boarding school

66
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,530
novel I'd written.

67
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,390
My hope port was that it would sell enough
to make it to paperback.

68
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:03,060
It never crossed my mind that it would still
be in print after ten years.

69
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,670
And I certainly never imagined that there
would be this beautiful tenth anniversary

70
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,160
edition with a cover designed by Rodrigo Corral.

71
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,360
And a big Q&A and a fancy introduction and
a bunch of scenes from early drafts.

72
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,250
But that book has surprised me over and over
again in the last ten years.

73
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,410
I want to thank everybody who's read it so
generously and shared it.

74
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,280
Also if you want to get the tenth anniversary
edition, there is a link in the dooblydoo

75
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,379
to preorder it.

76
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:25,319
Part six: Hank, you know how long ten years
is?

77
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,690
It's the difference between second grade and
your senior year.

78
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,060
i don't want to panic, but Looking for Alaska
came out ten years ago, which means that I

79
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,380
am extremely very old.

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,319
I'm having a smidge of crisis about it, so
old Nerfighters if you have any advice, I

81
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,319
would appreciate it.

82
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,640
Part seven: Hank, I saw you on freaking TV!

83
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,540
I was watching the Walking Dead and then AHHH
IT'S HANK!

84
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,379
That advertisement was the scariest and most
exciting part of the whole hour, which is

85
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,410
really saying something.

86
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,050
So congratulations; it's fun to see you on
TV!

87
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,420
But all things being equal, Hank, and I know
you share this opinion, I'd rather see you

88
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,420
on YouTube.

89
00:03:54,420 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on Friday.
