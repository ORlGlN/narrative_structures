1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,180
John: Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:02,180
It's actually Monday.

3
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:06,900
We just got to London, the game starts in
a few hours, I'm incredibly well-rested.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,590
I think it speaks to how dramatically my life
has changed since I had children that one

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,200
of the best nights of sleep I've had in years
occurred on an airplane.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,000
But I feel great, everybody's excited for
the game.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sarah and Rosianna : Yay!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,390
John: Hank, it's becoming harder and harder
to make the case that the Yeti is a yeti.

9
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,760
We're making a quick visit to the Saatchi
Gallery because you can't go to London and

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,760
not look at art.

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,810
Alright Hank, it is now 3:30 and therefore
getting dark in England, and we're on our

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,810
way to the game.

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:34,390
It doesn't start for 5 hours, but we're on
our way!

14
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:39,100
Here we are Hank, we have arrived for the
big game, I've gotten my match day scarves.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,100
So excited!

16
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,500
Alright Hank, I have, uh, now acquired basically
the entire AFC Wimbledon club shop.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,980
Clerk: If only he had bought all the stock!

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,980
(John and clerk laugh).

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,239
John: Alright Hank, now we're at the bar.

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,000
Um, we're going to have a couple pints- I
believe I used that term correctly- before

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
the game starts.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,370
These are the actual gloves that Seb Brown
used to save those two penalties against Luton

23
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,230
Town to send Wimbledon back into the league.

24
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,059
And of course, Hank, we are in the official
match day program.

25
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:05,579
Hank, it's happening!

26
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:06,579
It's real!

27
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:07,579
This is-gaaaah!

28
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:10,039
We sponsor a team that's playing Liverpool!

29
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:13,679
I know that you don't share my excitement
in this so it seems a little foreign to you,

30
00:01:13,679 --> 00:01:17,509
but it's just- it- I don't want to say it's
the best day of my life because I have two

31
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:22,899
children, the day of their births was amazing,
my wedding day was wonderful- But it's a best

32
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,369
day of my life, you know what I mean?

33
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:26,490
Okay Hank, the game is about to start.

34
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,829
Sarah is doing weird things by my face.

35
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:30,829
Man: Wombles!

36
00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:33,049
Woman: COME ON YOU DONS!

37
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:34,419
Crowd: AFC WIMBLEDON!

38
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:36,719
Man: Come on you Dons!

39
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,020
John: Okay Hank we're here.

40
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:45,919
I'm like 45 feet away from Steven Gerrard.

41
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:50,899
Okay Hank Liverpool scored that was very stressful
but then Wimbledon scored so now it's 1-1

42
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,239
- it's just incredibly exciting.

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,739
I've never been this excited ever.

44
00:01:56,739 --> 00:01:59,029
There's like a minute left in the first half.

45
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:02,130
It's not a foul he's just a larger person!

46
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,759
There's about 5 minutes left.

47
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:08,449
Liverpool is winning thanks to a Steven Gerrard
free kick.

48
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,818
It's hard to root against that.

49
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:15,049
There's Barry Fuller or as I call him on the
Wimbly Womblys Buckminster Fuller.

50
00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:17,209
This is incredibly exciting.

51
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,670
There's a Liverpool player taking a corner
from in front of the word Nerdfighter.

52
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,670
Crowd: Boo!

53
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,670
Boo!

54
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,670
Ya!

55
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:28,909
Man: Playing for a tie against a team three
divisions below you!

56
00:02:28,909 --> 00:02:33,819
John: So Hank after an immensely entertaining
game in which I found myself in the unusual

57
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:40,349
position of having to root against a Steven
Gerrard goal, AFC Wimbledon have done themselves

58
00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:42,730
proud and technically lost.

59
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:46,780
And now Hank it's the next morning, it's a
very strange thing to have my favorite player,

60
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,040
Steven Gerrard, score two goals to beat AFC
Wimbledon, but I have to say that was the

61
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,219
absolute time of my life.

62
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:57,379
Thanks to everyone at Wimbledon for hosting
us and showing us such a great time, and thanks

63
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:01,920
to everyone who watched the game and sent
in all their pictures of the DFTBAs and Nerdfighterias

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,140
all over the pitch.

65
00:03:03,140 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, I'll see you on Friday.
