00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,630
Good morning, John! Every time people get

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,310
frustrated with YouTube, I get a lot of messages saying, "Hank!

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:08,395
You make stuff. Why don't you start whole new

4
00:00:08,395 --> 00:00:11,075
competitor thing to YouTube?" And ultimately I feel

5
00:00:11,075 --> 00:00:13,985
like this comes down to a pretty central question when you're

6
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,840
upset with a situation in your life. Whether this is about your government

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,740
or a relationship or your online platform

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,340
Do you revolt?

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,400
Or do you reform?

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,620
If you want to reform your government,

11
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,520
you vote, you call your congressperson, you go to protests.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,900
You propose new ideas, you propose the removal of old, bad

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,935
policies. I you want to revolt against

14
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:33,565
your government, you probably have to take down

15
00:00:33,565 --> 00:00:36,555
your government, because you can't just leave and usually

16
00:00:36,555 --> 00:00:39,115
that goes badly because the government doesn't want to give up power

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,015
and so people start to kill each other and once you start to kill each other really

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,060
often times, the worst people are the ones who win. But

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,055
on the internet, if you want to revolt, you can just go somewhere

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,680
else, right? Maybe not. Here are 6 reasons why I

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,760
have no interest in leaving YouTube.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,040
ONE: It's actually quite good. Like the video player works

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,160
pretty much every time, it transfers really

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,280
seamlessly between my phone and my computer and my TV and as a creator I get to

25
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,780
benefit from a gigantic audience and also the ad sales team of the second largest corporation in the world.

26
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:09,075
TWO, and I've though a lot about this one, ultimately my

27
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:12,145
problems with YouTube are MY problems, not my audience's

28
00:01:12,145 --> 00:01:14,895
problems. You people. And while I appreciate

29
00:01:14,895 --> 00:01:17,595
people who say that they will go to the end of the world for

30
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:20,525
their faves, and I believe you, you are also my

31
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:23,340
fave, and I want to make a good experience for you

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:26,240
and to me, that is the experience that you're comfortable with

33
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,140
and that you've had for the last 11 years.

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,120
THREE: YouTube is really good at getting people to watch

35
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:34,105
videos. That's what that somewhat insidious algorithm is

36
00:01:34,105 --> 00:01:36,935
designed to do. And while I have some philosophical problems

37
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,340
with a company training neural networks to hack the human

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,120
brain into watching more content, I recognize

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,160
that every social media platform is doing that and the ones that don't

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,675
are gonna end up losing out to the

41
00:01:45,675 --> 00:01:48,545
other ones, which is the situation we're in right now, so, buckle

42
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:51,640
up for that over the next 10 years. And on that same train, number FOUR, I

43
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,700
want new people to find my content so I have to put my content in a place where new people are going to find it.

44
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,320
And YouTube shows my videos to new people, "Hi new person,

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,440
if you're one of them."

46
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,980
Here's a big one, number FIVE: YouTube's problems aren't really YouTube's problems,

47
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,979
they are the problems that any sufficiently big social video

48
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,440
platform would have. You have to get advertisers brought in,

49
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,620
you have to monetize for creators, and you have to be open

50
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,775
enough that there is so much content being uploaded to your platform that there's

51
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:19,825
no way you could review it all. The moment a new platform got big enough to matter,

52
00:02:19,825 --> 00:02:22,945
it would have all of the exact same problems that YouTube currently has,

53
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:25,820
and I don't actually know how to solve those problems.

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,855
And finally number SIX: I am sentimentally attached.

55
00:02:28,855 --> 00:02:31,695
Just like I'm not going to leave my country when things start to

56
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:34,435
bad, I just won't abandon this platform to leave

57
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:37,355
it to become a worse place without me.

58
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:40,435
When we criticize stuff, we don't actually have to imagine a solution

59
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:43,435
that works, we just have to imagine a solution that works for

60
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:46,615
us. But communities, in real life or online,

61
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:49,345
are more complicated than that--they have tons

62
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:51,740
of different stakeholders with different needs and different wants.

63
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,215
When you get further into the details you find that it's complicated,

64
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:58,015
and I am not saying "give in, give up, we're stuck,"

65
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:01,065
obviously not. When you love a place, you should want

66
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:03,800
to work to make it better. Imagining that you can just run away from

67
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,820
all the problems into some new place where no problems exist

68
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,820
is a self-indulgent fantasy.

69
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,420
I care about this a lot. I'm willing to fight for a better YouTube. I know

70
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:16,305
a lot of other people who are too. I think that's how you make a better YouTube,

71
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:19,405
not by starting it from scratch, but by caring enough about

72
00:03:19,405 --> 00:03:21,705
a place to work for it

73
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,920
 

74
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,835
If you have ideas for how to make YouTube better, please leave comments! Ideas are born out of people,

75
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,060
and if you want to talk about this stuff in the real world,

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,780
VidCon Europe this year is focused entirely on creator

77
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,380
and industry stuff, so these kinds of conversations.

78
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,420
We aren't having like a fan-focused community portion of the event this year because

79
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,840
that lost a bunch of money last year.

80
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,120
But it's March 22nd to 24th

81
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,080
You can find tickets at VidConEurope.com

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,780
And also, if you don't live in Amsterdam, you get to go to Amsterdam!

83
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,120
It's an opportunity to get together with other creators of all sizes, talk about craft and how you make it work,

84
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,320
and what you like to do, and also talk to brands and platforms and the kinds of people who will enable people

85
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,160
who wanna make stuff

86
00:03:58,160 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
