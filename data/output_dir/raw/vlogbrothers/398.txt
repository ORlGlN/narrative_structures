00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:01,089
Good morning, John!

2
00:00:01,089 --> 00:00:02,139
Welcome to Games with Hank!

3
00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:06,720
So a few years ago, I started HankGames, because
I'm Hank and I like games!

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,860
And when you said "Hey, I wanna come and also
play video games on HankGames," I was totally

5
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,860
into that idea!

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:15,950
And frankly, what you do at John Plays FIFA,
where there are these fictional soccer players,

7
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,110
who have a life together and are raising a
child and both happen to be named John Green,

8
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:24,500
while simultaneously raising actual money
for the ACTUAL team that exists in the REAL

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:29,930
life, SO MUCH money that in fact, now, Nerdfighteria's
logos are on the uniforms of that team!

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,489
THAT'S A REALLY COOL THING, and I don't wanna
take away from that.

11
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,000
But the thing I wanna do is different, and
I wanna upload a new Games with Hank episode

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,410
every single day of the week forever, and
I feel like it's different enough that I wanted

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:44,980
to start a whole new channel dedicated to
it, so THAT is what Games with Hank is!

14
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,980
We're starting out Games with Hank experimenting
with this.

15
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:49,930
This is the Oculus Rift, you put it on your
face.

16
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,219
You basically, suddenly, are in a new world.

17
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:58,350
Anybody who has spent any amount of time with
the Oculus comes out of the experience thinking

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,500
"Oh my God!

19
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,980
Everything's gonna change!"

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,049
It's completely different, from any other
media experience I have ever experienced.

21
00:01:08,049 --> 00:01:13,650
I'm starting out on Games with Hank with three
days of me playing a horror game.

22
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,180
HERE'S A COUPLE OF CLIPS FROM THAT.

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,119
Hank while playing: A nice house, with frien-
OOOHAHA, oh jeez, oh jeez, oh jeez, fart,

24
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,099
fart, fart, see, this is nice..

25
00:01:24,099 --> 00:01:28,799
Space, lots of room, the furniture's floating.

26
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,889
Play the.. play the music.

27
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:31,889
AAAAAAHHH!!!

28
00:01:31,889 --> 00:01:33,810
It's difficult to convey how scary this is!

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,700
When I take the Oculus off at the end of the
game, I'm like "Oh, right, I'm here!"

30
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,600
These virtual communities that have become
very real to me, I know that it just happens

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,549
on the computer screen, it's clearly not a
physical space, but the human condition is

32
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,659
that things occur in physical space, so if
things are occurring, we sort of apply physical

33
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:55,600
space to them, but we don't do a great job
of it.

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,859
But this COULD do a great job of that.

35
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:01,270
Now the really weird thing about all of this
is that physical spaces tend to change very

36
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,209
slowly; that's not the case on the internet.

37
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:07,630
Youtube changes its design and suddenly I
feel like somebody just redesigned my whole

38
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,630
house!

39
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,630
Why did you do that?!

40
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,680
I had a house, and I knew where the bathroom
was, and now I don't, and I'm like "Where

41
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,150
is the bathroom?!

42
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,150
WHERE DID YOU PUT THE BATHROOM?!"

43
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,200
That's an uncomfortable feeling!

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,849
Now in Games with Hank, we're gonna be playing
video games with the Oculus and other kinds

45
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:19,849
of video games, of course.

46
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:23,069
But the clear potential once you put this
thing on is so much greater than that for

47
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:28,709
the future of all kinds of entertainment,
for the future of sports, of art, of education,

48
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:31,300
of music, of exploration, of adventure, of
medicine, of politics!

49
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,349
I know that I'm extra excited right now because
I've just experienced something that is really

50
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,420
weird and different, so probably take this
with a grain of salt: but holy crap, man!

51
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,709
I think, what we're gonna have to be ready
for, is a lot of people saying how this is

52
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,860
going to destroy civilization, and a lot of
people saying how it's going to save civilization,

53
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,020
but here's my stellar prediction: neither
of those people are gonna be right.

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,890
Just like the internet, it's gonna be a mixed
bag, but it IS going to change things!

55
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,560
And I also will make NO predictions for how
it will actually be used!

56
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,750
People will try LOTS of things!

57
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,299
And some of those things will be extraordinarily
amazing and will resonate with what it is

58
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,299
to be human.

59
00:03:06,299 --> 00:03:08,340
As you could tell, pretty excited about it.

60
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
TWO QUICK UPDATES!

61
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,780
First, John, your punishment: I've decided
that you should get a tattoo!

62
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,010
But I know you don't wanna get a tattoo, so
instead, you're gonna get a tattoo without

63
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,840
any ink in the gun!

64
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,319
It's just gonna hurt a lot, and you won't
have anything to show for it.

65
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,469
Second, Vlogbrothers has had prerolls on it
for over a month now, which means that we

66
00:03:25,469 --> 00:03:29,459
have a big pile of cash that we're distributing
to awesome creators!

67
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,219
One of those creators is Youtube's Physics
Girl, who we're giving an equipment grant

68
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,219
to!

69
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:37,049
And the other is Kelly Kend, who's working
on a documentary about consent and sexual

70
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,049
assault.

71
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:41,950
Kelly's documentary raised $10,000 on Kickstarter,
which she spent all of already working on

72
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,950
the film.

73
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,769
I found her stuff, I reached out to her and
I said "Here's some of Nerdfighteria's money,"

74
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:46,769
she's very excited about it.

75
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:49,359
I did a little interview with her and I'll
put it up on Hankschannel.

76
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,030
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

77
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,249
I mean, I really think if you remodeled this
place it could be quite nice.

78
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:57,780
You might want to instead just wanna burn
it to the ground, though, if you have the

79
00:03:57,780 --> 00:00:00,000
option.
