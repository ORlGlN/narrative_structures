00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,520
Good morning, John,

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,320
it's Wednesday... What am I doing here?

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,940
It's Wednesday, that's not how this works. It's weird!

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,000
Okay, it's gonna get weirder. John, you know that I love

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,520
documentary films, and I know that you do, because

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,100
we're nerds. But I think they have a problem, because

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,020
we're busy. Not just with work and

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,040
stuff, but with

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,760
all the distractions

10
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,600
that-- I'm gesturing toward

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,100
my computer right now. There's a giant crisis looming around every

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,700
corner, and if we don't want to

13
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,960
look at that, and we want to look at, like,

14
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,600
cute or funny stuff, there's

15
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,960
always a place to go look

16
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,760
for that. And you can do that really fast,

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,940
and have, like, a 15-second thing, or a 15-minute thing

18
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,980
and documentaries, though... they're long.

19
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,760
They're often much more slowly paced than a lot of our

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,360
media these days, which is, like, "AHHH, I gotta be doing stuff, all the time".

21
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,420
Even if it is, like, a really efficient way to learn something, we

22
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,520
don't feel like it is? But they're one of the most effective tools for giving us insight

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,300
into our humanity, and into the lives of other people

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,740
or other animals. Documentary film

25
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,360
is fantastic, but more

26
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,160
and more I feel like there isn't a good place for it.

27
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,680
There's not a good, like, "okay it's time now

28
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,700
to have this kind of experience".

29
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,580
Which is why we were pretty excited when YouTube Red came to us and were like "we have this idea..."

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,880
They had recently acquired

31
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,860
the rights to this new award-winning documentary that everybody's talking about

32
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,720
and they wanted to make it available to YouTube Red subscribers. But YouTube is weird;

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,700
it's a bunch of channels that already exist,

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,140
you can't just create a new

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,360
channel every time you have a new documentary.

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,420
So they asked us to watch the documentary, which we did

37
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,780
and we both loved it, and then if we did like it,

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,180
maybe we could talk about it on the vlogbrothers channel, and then

39
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,620
upload it here, for YouTube Red subscribers. Now I am aware that

40
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,920
not everybody has YouTube Red or can get YouTube Red, though there is a free trial available right now.

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,420
It's only available in some countries, and not everybody has ten bucks

42
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,500
a month to spare: I understand that.

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,560
But if you do, the film is either now available, or will very

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,640
shortly be available on the Vlogbrothers channel.

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,260
It's really good, it's got like a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, it's...it's a good thing.

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,180
It's a movie about street cats in Istanbul. It turns out

47
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,300
that Istanbul has a really interesting

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,620
relationship with its cats. They're cared for

49
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,100
by the humans of Istanbul, but they don't tend to be owned by

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,199
any one person. Ah, look, I'm a cat person. There's

51
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,700
something magical about them. And there's something

52
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,820
appropriate about how this movie, 'Kedi', asks us to slow down a little bit, and be okay

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,820
just spending a little bit of time, watching pretty pictures

54
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,580
and compelling stories

55
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:25,800
about the lives of these cats. Because that's one of

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,120
the great services that cats provide:

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,780
They get in your way. They say "Hey, stop what you're doing.

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,340
Me! I'm beautiful! And soft! Stop with the

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,600
computer-staring and give me some chin-scratches". They lead by

60
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,940
example, showing us that it is okay to sometimes, just--

61
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,200
exist. And that is what this film, which Variety called

62
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:50,600
"quietly magical", asks of us. To just exist for a little

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,700
while. I was able to spend a little bit of time talking to the makers of this film,

64
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
Ceyda Torun and Charlie Wuppermann,

65
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,360
and Ceyda said something in that chat

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,680
that I thought was really lovely and poignant:

67
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,420
that the relationship between people and cats is one of the only relationships

68
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,400
with another species that people don't dominate.

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,420
Cats exist with people of their own accord, y'know?

70
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,740
And looking at myself through a cat's eyes

71
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,920
gives me a perspective that I think is really hard to find other ways,

72
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:20,120
and I think that it's really well discovered and shared in this movie.

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,960
I hope that everybody who can will join me in watching this film.

74
00:03:22,960 --> 00:00:00,000
John,  you will see me for my regularly scheduled video on Friday.
