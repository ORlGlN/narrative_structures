00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,640
Good morning John

2
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,880
Taxes aren't any fun.

3
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,460
Figuring out how much to pay isn't fun,

4
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
filing a return isn't fun,

5
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,060
being completely confused isn't fun

6
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,020
Having less money isn't fun

7
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,400
But this video's gonna be fun. It's gonna be so fun.

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,320
Oh man, you won't even believe it; it's gonna be great.

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,760
Because instead of doing what everyone else does, and like,

10
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,500
talk about candidates as if they are personified ideology and then yell.

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,720
We're just gonna talk about the tax plans of two people who

12
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,620
want to be president of  the United States of America: Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

13
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:30,880
But first we do have to talk about the current state of taxes in the US, a bit.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,340
About 60% of taxes paid in the US are paid to the federal govenment

15
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,480
another 20% to states, another 14% to local governments.

16
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,860
We are only dealing with that first 60%.

17
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,820
That 60% comes from mostly 4 places.

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:48,060
37% comes from ordinary income tax, 33% from payroll tax, 11% from corporate tax,

19
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,340
and 5-10% from capital gains tax.

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,820
QUICK NOTE! Pause if you want to read it.

21
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:55,120
Ordinary income tax is a percentage tax that you pay

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,340
on the money that you get paid.

23
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,360
Here are, as of April 2016, the current tax brackets.

24
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,600
The phrase "tax brackets" though is confusing.

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,660
It makes it seem like if your income reaches a certain level

26
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,040
all of your income gets lumped into the new bracket

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,940
and you pay this higher tax on everything

28
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,340
That is in fact not how it works.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,220
Everyone pays the same amount of tax for the first 18,000 dollars

30
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,740
and so on. Like, this here hypothetical person

31
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,500
who had 250,000 dollars of income

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,940
they only pay the 33% tax on this last 20,000 dollars

33
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,660
This chunk here is taxed to 28%

34
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,140
this next hunk at 25

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,820
This is what we call marginal tax rates

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,160
It's a term, just forget it, who cares?

37
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,480
Hillary Clinton has a plan, it's very simple

38
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,640
Just keep everything the same except

39
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,960
add one new tax bracket for all income earned over 5 million dollars

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,300
So whenever one person earns over 5 million dollars

41
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:49,200
instead of being taxed at 39.6% it gets taxed at 43.6%

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,160
Bernie's tax plan, gotta spend a little more time here

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,800
'cause there's more going on

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,420
Everybody pays an extra 2.2% that goes

45
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,960
to helping create a single-payer healthcare system in the US

46
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,180
and the tax brackets are moved around a bit

47
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,540
and new ones are added for between 500 thousand

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,580
and 2 million, and between 2 million and 10 million

49
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,940
and over 10 million. Simple enough.

50
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,920
We spend a lot of time talking about

51
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,000
income tax and for good reason.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,500
It's the money that we use to

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,720
run the government. But there's this other kind of tax

54
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,660
called payroll tax. Payroll tax is basically income tax.

55
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,560
It's just paid for by both  you and by your employer,

56
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,420
and if you don't have an employer, you pay the whole thing

57
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,640
And when that happens you stop calling it payroll tax

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,140
and you start calling it self-employment tax. But it's the same thing.

59
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,520
Though the costs of payroll taxes are paid for by both you and your employer,

60
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,300
they are taxes on your income, and so they are an income tax.

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
But they are weirdly invisible.

62
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,180
They are either withdrawn from your paycheck before it even gets to you

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,940
Or, even more invisibly, they're paid for by your employer and you just don't know that that's happening.

64
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,460
I am an employer of employees and for every person I have

65
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,520
there are a bunch of taxes that I pay.

66
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,560
So if they're making 40,000 dollars a year

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,920
even before any of their taxes get taken out of their paycheck I'm actually paying 46,000 a year for that employee

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,400
Payroll taxes go to pay for specific things

69
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,240
and they are things that we all like.

70
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,140
I mean, I hope so.

71
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,240
One of them is the Medicare payroll tax.

72
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,840
It just has two tax brackets: above and below  250,000 dollars

73
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
and social security

74
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,960
Which is a little more complicated

75
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,820
Get ready!

76
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,140
Social security is designed to compensate you after you retire

77
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,980
based on the amount of money you earn throughout your career.

78
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,200
But it will not compensate you for your income over a certain level.

79
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,800
It just stops and it says okay you're probably good enough

80
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,080
and we don't need to worry about social security for you

81
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,340
so we'll stop taking it out.

82
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,120
That level is about $118,000 so at that point you stop getting taxed social security payroll tax.

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,120
It just stops happening.

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,660
Clinton's plan, again, leaves all of this alone

85
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,300
while Sanders' plan does two important things.

86
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,340
First, it raises everyone's payroll tax by an additional  6.2%

87
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:52,080
Again, that money going to help fund a single payer healthcare system in the US

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,220
Bernie's plan also reintroduces the social security tax after $250,000

89
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,500
So income between $118,000 to $250,000 still doesn't have that tax on it

90
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,780
So that's it for ordinary income tax, that wasn't that bad!

91
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,280
But in the US we also have a completely different system for taxing money that you made

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,920
by buying something and then selling it later for a higher price.

93
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,900
Usually that thing is a stock on the stock market

94
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,700
also maybe bonds, also maybe real estate

95
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,180
That kind of income, for complicated reasons, is taxed differently

96
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,920
and right now the taxes on that kind of income are based on household income.

97
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,840
Hillary Clinton - this is gonna be a trend - keeps this pretty much the same

98
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,180
though she does raise the taxes on medium term investments

99
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,440
which are the kind of investments that

100
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,740
generally more active stock traders do

101
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,560
Bernie's plan starts out by adding that same 2.2 tax that we saw earlier

102
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,300
to all capital gains income

103
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:44,160
and then changes all capital gains income tax to the normal income tax level after $250,000

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,260
of household income

105
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,340
And that is it for all of the actual taxes stuff

106
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,120
but we still have some more tax policy stuff to talk about

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,360
So fun!

108
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,240
Both Bernie and Hillary have the same plan as President Obama for limiting

109
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,920
tax deductions taken by higher income households

110
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,320
Hillary would create a $1,200 tax for caregivers

111
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,800
and also give tax credits to businesses that

112
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,700
set up profit sharing programs and skills training programs.

113
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Bernie and Hillary both want to establish a tax on high frequency financial trading

114
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,860
though the way they want to do it is different

115
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,660
And they also both want to leave the current corporate tax rate alone

116
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,380
while trying to close some loopholes that US corporations currently use

117
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,660
like setting up their offices in tax havens, stuff like that.

118
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,160
Their plans are different from each other, though, but I'm not gonna get into corporate taxes

119
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,380
cause eughhh

120
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,320
But basically you can see what's going on here.

121
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,500
Hillary is leaving the tax code roughly the same

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,860
while Bernie is increasing taxes across the board

123
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
especially for people who make more than $250,000 a year

124
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,360
which is about 1.5% of Americans

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,380
He's doing that mostly to create a single payer healthcare system

126
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,540
where the government becomes everyone's insurance company. It's basically Medicare but for everybody.

127
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,400
The revenue generated would also strengthen social security and pay people to go to college.

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,200
Now all of this is complicated because under Bernie Sanders

129
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,760
yes your tax rates would go up but you are already paying a lot of money

130
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,120
in your healthcare premiums, probably, so

131
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,700
so while taxes would go up, the goal is that the average person would

132
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,440
pay less money over the course of the year in both taxes and healthcare costs.

133
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,560
We know that publicly funded healthcare systems have been less expensive in other parts of the world but we don't know

134
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
whether that would be true in the US. The reasons

135
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,920
The reasons why healthcare in the US is so expensive are incredibly complicated

136
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,800
So it's impossible to know whether these new taxes would be enough to pay for a universal healthcare system

137
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,780
or if additional revenue would be needed. There are some

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,840
other criticisms of Sanders' plan:

139
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,720
The nonpartisan tax policy center pointed out that

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,540
costs of starting a new business or growing a business would go up under this plan

141
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,300
possibly enough to significantly decrease economic activity

142
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,940
But then maybe having people not needing to worry as much about healthcare or retirement

143
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,160
means that the economy is healthier. I don't know.

144
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,860
Now if you are wondering why I spent a lot more time talking about Bernie's plan

145
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,580
than about Hillary's plan, it's because Bernie's plan would involve far, far more change.

146
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,240
And while it's easy to have thoughts about which one of these plans seems better or even more moral

147
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,440
in a quick gut check, it is impossible to know all of the effects of these tax plans and

148
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,120
smart professional people who think about this for a living disagree all the time

149
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
on which plan is the best

150
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,700
In short, I am now going to say something that you will never hear on

151
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,960
cable news, uh, as far as which one of these plans is the best plan for people of this country

152
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,620
and for the future of this country

153
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,260
I do not know.

154
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,540
That wasn't so hard to admit

155
00:07:15,540 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I will see you with your analysis of Ted Cruz's and Donald Trump's plans on Tuesday.
