00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,130
Good morning John.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,770
This video is for young people in America.

3
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:05,350
You are not a young person in America, but
you can still watch.

4
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:09,930
In fact, please do, and if you feel compelled
to, send this video to young people you know

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,930
in America.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,910
It's time to talk about why we're not voting.

7
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,530
Here are some of the reasons I hear.

8
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,480
"I don't want to get jury duty."

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,480
STOP.

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,480
No.

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,480
NO.

12
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Nothin' - no correlation between those two
things.

13
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,070
You get jury duty whether or not you're registered
to vote.

14
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,429
"I don't want to vote for the lesser of two
evils."

15
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:25,659
Why - why not?

16
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,509
It's the lesser of two evils.

17
00:00:27,509 --> 00:00:30,339
Do you want to vote for the greater of two
evils?

18
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:33,930
Because not voting is like half a vote for
the greater of two evils.

19
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,310
Also I just did my absentee ballot and I felt
a lot of times like I was voting for the greater

20
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,660
of two goods.

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,660
It happens.

22
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,150
"I don't know who or what to vote for."

23
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,890
This is a completely acceptable excuse.

24
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,190
However, if you care about the world, it's
really easy nowadays to do research on the

25
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,110
ballot initiatives and candidates on your
ballot.

26
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,410
Just google the place where you live and "voter
information packet" or "candidates."

27
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,410
Do a little research.

28
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,410
It'll take like a half hour.

29
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,940
Also don't feel bad for not voting on every
single thing on the ballot.

30
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,690
Here's something from mine: "To change the
name of the State Auditor to Commissioner

31
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,579
of Securities and Insurance.'"

32
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,119
I don't care about that.

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,850
"I don't even know if I'm registered."

34
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,219
Allow me to introduce you to canivote.org.

35
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,530
It will tell you in like twelve seconds.

36
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:11,740
"I'm not registered."

37
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,409
Eleven states including California have same
day voter registration, and even in places

38
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,960
that don't, there's still time to register.

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,820
You can check out how in the links in the
description.

40
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,170
"I don't really care."

41
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,630
This is completely acceptable; if you don't
care don't vote.

42
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,119
It's, like, one of the good excuses.

43
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,429
"Big corporations and millionaires are the
only ones who actually decide the outcomes

44
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:28,710
of elections."

45
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,189
Big corporations get fewer votes than you
do, and millionaires get the exact same number.

46
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,659
However, millionaires do disproportionately
affect elections because 99% of them vote!

47
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:40,939
If you want proof that millionaires can't
buy elections, there it is for ya.

48
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:45,140
They go to the polls and they vote because
they know that is the only way people get

49
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,140
elected.

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
"I can't get to the poll on November 4th."

51
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,130
Another completely legitimate reason, and
I'm sorry to hear that, and look into absentee

52
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,829
boating next - boating?

53
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:54,869
Absentee boating - is not something you want
to do.

54
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,329
"I'm just done with this, the gridlocks and
bickering and cynicism - I just don't want

55
00:01:58,329 --> 00:01:59,429
to be a part of it."

56
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:00,429
I feel you.

57
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:01,429
I absolutely do.

58
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,110
Campaigns these days seem to be more about
energizing the base in the form of angering

59
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,580
and terrifying them than they are about actually
talking about issues or providing information.

60
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,020
This tends to turn away more moderate voters
- especially young people.

61
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,030
But the more moderate voters are the ones
that we need to turn this country away from

62
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,450
partisanship and gridlock.

63
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,330
"It's not even a democracy."

64
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,790
OH MY GOD, YES IT IS.

65
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,600
You know how many democracies there were in
the world in 1900?

66
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
ZERO.

67
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,950
There was no universal suffrage in the entire
world.

68
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,450
We could do better in America.

69
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,570
It could be more representative.

70
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,330
In fact, there are ballot measures in lots
of states designed to make it less representative.

71
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,860
The only way to make it more representative
is to vote.

72
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,540
And finally, the one that bugs me the most:
"You know my vote's not going to matter."

73
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,400
The notion that your vote won't matter because
it probably won't be the individual deciding

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,000
vote in a particular election is a magnificent
failure of imagination.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,850
If every young person who used this excuse
got off their butt and voted one Tuesday every

76
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:02,020
two years, they would literally be the deciding
vote in thousands of elections.

77
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,720
So maybe it's time to do that.

78
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,820
To recognize that the power lies with us.

79
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,080
That's what democracies are.

80
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,150
Make this country better because you can,
so you kinda have an obligation to.

81
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,350
People born after the year 1980 make up like
30% of the electorate now.

82
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,380
But only 21% of people under the age of 24
are expected to vote this election.

83
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,230
If you aren't voting, no one is hearing your
voice, so they have no reason to represent

84
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,230
you.

85
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,070
There's only one way you can change that and
it is a very easy thing: vote.

86
00:03:29,070 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
