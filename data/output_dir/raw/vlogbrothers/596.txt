1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,600
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,760
This election was one for the history books.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,560
The first female amputee in Congress,

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,420
the first female Asian American Senator,

5
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,860
the first openly gay Senator

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,040
the first second term for a black president

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,300
the first legalization of recreational marijuana

8
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,960
and the first legalization of gay marriage.

9
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,100
But it is possible that the biggest piece of American history

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:24,120
that happened yesterday was not discussed on any of the news stations that you watched last night.

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,960
Indeed, it may not even have been decided in America

12
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,460
but, interestingly, it was decided by Americans.

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,760
Because Puerto Ricans, who live in Puerto Rico,  are American citizens.

14
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:41,200
They use American money, they travel with American passports, they can serve in the American military, and they must obey American laws.

15
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,040
But Puerto Rico is not part of America, it is a territory, a colony, basically.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,000
Puerto Rico, as it stands, governs itself,

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,600
But their foreign policy is determined by the United States government.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,640
We decide who they trade with,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
And who they go to war with,

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,740
And they pay many but not all of the same taxes that Americans pay

21
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,980
But they can't vote in our elections, and they don't have representation in our government

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,380
The U.N., which is sort of staunchly opposed to colonization, unsurprisingly says that this is not really O.K.

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,640
Which is why, the southern most point in the Eurozone is here which is an island that is part of France.

24
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,300
But the people of Puerto Rico, had always, until yesterday, just said that it's fine with them that things are the way that they are so the U.N. is cool with it.

25
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,640
And y'know the people of Puerto Rico have it pretty well, they have universal health care,

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,820
Their life expectancy is longer that ours,

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,900
they pay into and receive Social Security,

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:35,880
But at the same time they have thirteen percent unemployment and per capita income two thirds that of the poorest U.S state

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,500
Also interestingly, the U.N.,

30
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,560
President Obama,

31
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Governor Romney,

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,360
and the platforms of both the Democratic and Republican parties all agree,

33
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,700
that Puerto Rico should be able to decide for itself whether or not it should be a state.

34
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,180
But now that, apparently, they actually have decided that, that raises some really interesting issues.

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,680
And potentially problems, beyond whether or not we can fit an extra star on the flag

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:03,340
The issue that I think we'll hear from the opposition, is that there will be twenty billion dollars of extra costs for Medicare and Medicaid,

37
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,000
But honestly the bigger political issue here is that this will change the balance of congress.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,300
If Puerto Rico became a state, it would automatically get two senators, so there would be 102 senators,

39
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,640
And it would also get five or six representatives in the House.

40
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,580
Those five representatives would not just be added to the house, they would actually have to come out of other districts in America.

41
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,820
In effect, decreasing the representation of other states, which a lot of states, I think, would probably be upset about.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,560
Also, probably all of those Congresspeople would be Democrats, so this is not something that a Republican house, for example, would be super excited about giving a supermajority to.

43
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,380
Because, yes, in order to grant statehood to a place, you don't just need 51% of the vote, you need two thirds.

44
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:46,320
And in a country where we can, right now, barely get anything done with a simple majority, a super majority just seems crazy.

45
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:52,120
Another complication is that this remains an extremely decisive issue inside of Puerto Rico when they just elected a governor,

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,960
Which is basically their president, who is not in favor of statehood.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,260
But what could end up being the bigger barrier to Puerto Rico's statehood has nothing to do with what's happening in Puerto Rico,

48
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,820
Or the politics of this situation,

49
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,660
It's simply that Americans don't seem to really like change very much.

50
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:09,140
By now it almost feels like America's number of states is somehow numerologically fixed

51
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,280
And these 50 states have always been and shall always be these 50 states

52
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,940
Now, of course, that isn't true, we have had many different numbers of states throughout our history.

53
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,200
But let's be honest, it's not about what's true, it's about what feels true,

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:30,960
And, to a lot of people, that's what America feels like, and messing with the fundamental idea of American-ness is not a great political decision, generally.

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,600
Even if it's the right decision.

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Nonetheless, a fascinating outcome on a fascinating and historical day.

57
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,440
Thank you to everyone who voted yesterday in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico,

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,640
Let us all please proceed toward a more perfect union, no matter how many states that union has,

59
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,880
John, I'll see you tomorrow.

60
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:55,960
QUICK NOTE: tomorrow morning on DFTBA.com we will be starting a pre-order of an interesting new item, and I'm just not going to tell you what it is, because it's... weird.

61
00:03:55,960 --> 00:00:00,000
But you might want to go to DFTBA.com tomorrow morning, and check it out.
