1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Good Morning, Hank! It's Tuesday!

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,540
So, before meeting a lot of Nerdfighters last night in single "n", double "n", single "t" Cincinnati,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,580
I was here, in the Miami Whitewater Forest,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,059
where the autumn leaves are falling, and 
the squirrels are appropriately afraid of humans,

5
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:19,100
and while walking alone through the forest, 
I thought to myself,

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,620
I don't really wanna make a "Thoughts from Places" 
video today while I'm here,

7
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,220
I just wanna go on a freaking walk without
videotaping every single thing I do.

8
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,500
So it's Question Tuesday, the day I answer 
real questions from real Nerdfighters,

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,220
let's get right to it!

10
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,659
What are you going to be for Halloween?

11
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm gonna be a 35 year old man.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,740
Why is legislation to kill the penny being 
held up in Congress?

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,580
Because if the current Congress were 
actually and physically on fire,

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,880
they couldn't pass a Throw Water on Congress Act.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,220
Who is your OTP?

16
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,180
Peanut butter and honey, 
their OTP name is Pea-bunny.

17
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,500
What does the raven symbolize in that 
Edgar Allen Poe poem?

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,060
Death.

19
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,360
A good rule of thumb is that if you see something that

20
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,840
looks like it might be a symbol in a work 
by Edgar Allen Poe, it's death.

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,760
What's something you've always wanted to microwave?

22
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,660
Oh, peeps!

23
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,100
Hot plate,

24
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,640
disgusting,

25
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,120
somewhat burnt, 
microwaved peeps.

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,380
To go with my lunch of apples.

27
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,500
Pancakes, or pancakes?

28
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,840
Pancakes! I mean, I realize this is stating the obvious,

29
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,900
but they are cakes that you can cook in a pan! 
It's an everyday miracle!

30
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,980
Would you rearrange the alphabet if you could?

31
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,500
Yeah, totally.

32
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,840
I'd be so much better at alphabetizing if instead of
having to sing the ABC song every freaking time,

33
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,940
I could just say Big Fjords Vex Quick Waltz Nymph.

34
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,460
Sure, we'd then have two a's, but we need two a's!

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,700
Best book I've never heard of?

36
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,560
The Blood of the Lamb by Peter de Vries

37
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,500
which inspired large parts of An Imperial Affliction
 by Peter van Houten.

38
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Can you draw a platypus?

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,160
Yes. Yes, I can.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,140
When is that box set thing coming out?

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,040
That box set thing comes out on October 25th

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,660
and there's a limited edition that have both The Fault in 
Our Stars and Looking for Alaska signed,

43
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,660
link in the doobly-doo.

44
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:53,760
Did you ever feel slightly attracted to Augustus Waters 
while writing The Fault in Our Stars?

45
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,800
No! A little bit.

46
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Why does the number pi never end?

47
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,460
I don't know, it's totally irrational.

48
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,400
Velociraptor or Brontosaurus?

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,640
I don't know, let's call an expert.

50
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,120
(To Henry) Hey, Henry, do you like brontosaurus 
or velociraptor better?

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,320
Henry: Velociraptor!
John: You like velociraptors better?

52
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,000
Henry: Yeah!
John: Velociraptors.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,080
In what situation is it appropriate to 
use the acronym YOLO?

54
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Really in any situation where you're acting out 
of an abundance of caution,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,380
for instance, "I think I'll obey the speed limit today, YOLO"

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,120
or "I'm gonna pass up this opportunity to go skydiving because YOLO".

57
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,660
Do you think you'd jump from space?

58
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,280
No, I wouldn't jump from table.

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,940
Favorite statue?
This guy.

60
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Least favorite statue?
This guy

61
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,240
Favorite president?
James K. Polk, Napoleon of the Stump

62
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,880
Did Barack Obama's tumblr really post Hank's voting video?

63
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,060
No! Wait, really? Really?

64
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,900
Hank, you are on the President's tumblr!

65
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,940
Also, the President has a tumblr.

66
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,520
Why don't any of the main characters in 
your books have siblings?

67
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,280
Ahh, it's just my little way of telling Hank that 
he doesn't exist in my narrative imagination.

68
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,740
Wait, who the eff is Hank?

69
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,680
Hank is an American folk rock band originally 
formed in Claremont, California.

70
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,720
Hey, what's your favorite part of Atlas Shrugged?

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,100
No.

72
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,040
Hey, what have you learned from teaching 
world history for a year?

73
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,020
I've learned that humans generally get less 
miserable when we collaborate

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,000
and that we get totally hosed when we choose 
ideology over actual humans.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,340
Hey, when will your next book come out?

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know, 2014, 2015? It's gonna be a while.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,540
Gandalf or Dumbledore?

78
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,380
I'm hiding under the table so you people can't attack me, 
but Gandalf.

79
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,200
Favorite period of history?
Wait for it... the Mongols.

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,300
All time five favorite John Greens?

81
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,980
Alright, in order, 
Bald John Green, Other John Green,

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,420
the political science professor, 
the mustachioed cavalry officer,

83
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,040
and the Bigfoot researcher known as 
one of the four horsemen of Sasquatchery.

84
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,740
Will this be the last question?
Indeed it will.

85
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,420
Nerdfighters, thank you for all your great questions;

86
00:03:39,420 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, thank you for your brilliant video last week, 
I will see you on Friday.
