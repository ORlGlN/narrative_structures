1
00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:01,099
Good morning Hank; it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:03,399
I am in North Carolina for the Paper Towns
movie.

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,310
I actually slept- [alarm chirps quickly] That.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,820
That is the reason that I slept last night
in director Jake Schreier's apartment.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,070
So even though we don't start filming for
a week, I've already slept with the director

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,340
and had pizza with Cara Delevingne.

7
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,500
I'm getting to know everyone pretty intimately.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,990
Okay [beep] Aughhhh!

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,570
Okay we have to go to a meeting and plus that's
happening every twenty seconds, so walk with

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:24,570
me.

11
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,780
John: This is Issac Klausner the executive
producer of Paper Towns.

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,590
And executive producer of The Fault in Our
Stars.

13
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,590
Isaac: Hello.

14
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,029
John: And this is Jake Schreier who is directing
the movie.

15
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,029
Jake: Hello.

16
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,369
John: That is the schedule for the movie.

17
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,390
I'm not gonna get any closer to it because
I can't show it to you, but that is it.

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:37,649
The whole movie is on that wall.

19
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,920
So I just sat in on a meeting about, like,
camera angles and shots, and there was a lot

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,149
of language that I don't even know what the
words mean.

21
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:46,620
Which is weird, Hank, because I am also in
the movie making business.

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,710
You know like a, like these movies.

23
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,530
So Hank, I really liked your video about the
octothorpe.

24
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,229
There's just something really compelling about
people including a symbol in their technology

25
00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:56,350
even though they don't know what it's for
yet.

26
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,350
Lone coat hanger.

27
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,350
Hello there.

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,929
You know what, coat hanger, I know that you're
alone in the world right now, and I know it's

29
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,879
not easy, but I want you to know that one
day you are gonna hold some clothes.

30
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:08,270
Right, but about octothorpes: there's this
extraordinary generosity involved in creating

31
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,170
something and leaving room inside of it for
other people to create.

32
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,240
John: Now admittedly most of what we did was
create hashtags, but still.

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,240
Oh.

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,240
Lacey Pemberton's here.

35
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,240
Halston: Do we look into the camera?

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,240
John: Yeah.

37
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Halston: Oh hi guys.

38
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,240
John: It's first person.

39
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,240
This is Halston Sage.

40
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Halston: Hi!

41
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
John: Who plays Lacey in the movie.

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Have you read the book?

43
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
Halston: I love the book.

44
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
John: Thank you.

45
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
Halston: I even highlighted it.

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
John: She has to say that.

47
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
She's obligated to.

48
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,570
Halston: I have the cutest fifteen year old
sister; her name's Kate.

49
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,570
She's actually a huge fan.

50
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,600
John: Is she really?

51
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,630
Halston: Yeah, yeah!

52
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,630
So this is-
John: Hi Kate!

53
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,630
Halston: Hi Kate!

54
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,990
John: This is Jaz Sinclair who plays Angela
in the movie.

55
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:39,990
Jaz: Hi!

56
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,039
John: So Jaz is a fan of the book and, um,
was really excited to audition, and she just

57
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,039
killed it.

58
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,039
So.

59
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:48,329
Now she's Angela.

60
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,329
How tall are you?

61
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:50,329
5'4"?

62
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:51,329
Jaz: 5'5".

63
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,329
How tall are you?

64
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,329
John: 6'1".

65
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:55,340
But don't tell my brother that because he's
also 6'1" and he's about an inch taller than

66
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
I am.

67
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,340
Jaz: So you're NOT 6'1".

68
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,670
John: And this is Justice Smith who plays
Radar in the movie.

69
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,670
Justice: Hello.

70
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,159
I'm not an a MMA fighter though.

71
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,030
John: Right there's a guy; we'll put a he's
gonna be right over- ugh I'm so bad at that.

72
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,400
Justice: Yeah he'll be right.

73
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,790
John: But he is a 6'9" 44 year old MMA fighter,
which I don't, just didn't feel was right

74
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:13,790
for the part.

75
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,790
Justice: Right.

76
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,790
John: Yeah.

77
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,790
Justice: But a lot of people were upset.

78
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,790
A lot of people were mad about it.

79
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,790
John: Yeah.

80
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,940
Yeah, no, we cast Justice instead.

81
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,390
I like your sweater today!

82
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,390
Justice: Thanks.

83
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,460
I almost got a hundred bucks for it!

84
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
John: It's pretty nice!

85
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,780
Justice: I almost got ... from Austin, he
almost paid me a hundred bucks.

86
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
John: The guy who's playing Ben.

87
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Justice: Yeah.

88
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,180
Ben almost paid me a hundred bucks for this
sweater.

89
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,180
John: Ahhhh!

90
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,910
Justice: What's up bud?

91
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,740
John: How are you?

92
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Justice: I'm good.

93
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
How are you?

94
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,740
John: I'm good.

95
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
You gonna go get your hair cut?

96
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Justice: Yeah.

97
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,740
John: I just found out that Justice is a big
Grace Helbig fan.

98
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,740
Justice: Yeah, I love her.

99
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,740
John: Hank.

100
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Hank!

101
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,740
Hank!

102
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,740
I'm, I'm in the room with the black Santas.

103
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,740
This is part of Saul's house from Homeland.

104
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,010
It's not going to be in our movie.

105
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,110
That stuff will though, on the other side
of that, but I can't show it to you because

106
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,110
that would be cheating.

107
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,870
So Hank, we're going to the read-through now
where we're gonna all hear the cast read the

108
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,700
script for the first time.

109
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,040
Stop photobombing!

110
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,670
It's very exciting.

111
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,270
And then I think I get to go to bed.

112
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,270
Mike: Hi, Hank!

113
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,740
John: You guys did a good job with the script.

114
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,200
Scott: Thank you that means, uh ...

115
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Mike: Oh!

116
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,260
Scott: ... a lot coming from somebody who's
read the book.

117
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,190
John: Okay, the table read went great, but
I am exhausted.

118
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,480
But I'm so excited about the Paper Towns movie
and so grateful to everyone who's coming together

119
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,480
to make it.

120
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,870
Long-time nerdfighters will know that I've
had some slightly tortured experiences with

121
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,490
Paper Towns in Hollywood over the years.

122
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,240
But now, everything's going so well, and I'm
just so excited.

123
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,400
So thank you to everyone who had read the
book and supported it.

124
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Hank, thank you!

125
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,540
I was watching your video, and it occurred
to me that genuinely, of all the people I

126
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,680
know, you are the best at building things
that have octothorpes inside of them.

127
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,220
So thanks for all the octothorpes.

128
00:03:40,220 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on Friday.
