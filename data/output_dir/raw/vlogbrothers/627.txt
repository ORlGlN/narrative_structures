00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,000
Today I'd like to deliver an open letter

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,700
to students returning to school.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,260
Dear students returning to school:

5
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,500
Not to speed your re-entry into formal education

6
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
with a pop quiz or anything,

7
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,880
but in what year do you think primary education

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
became mandatory for all American children?

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,380
1918.

10
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,160
Germany had primary compulsory education

11
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,380
from the late 18th century,

12
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,200
in Japan, thanks to the Meiji reforms,

13
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,700
by 1900, 90% of Japanese kids were in school.

14
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,300
in England, it happen around 1880,

15
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,420
but regardless of where you live,

16
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,000
primary education became a requirement

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,120
sometime after 1775.

18
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,080
That probably seems like a long time ago to you,

19
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,700
but if you look at like human history since the Agricultural revolution

20
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,700
the entire period of time that has featured compulsory education

21
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,500
anywhere in the world looks like...

22
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,420
this

23
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,200
You'll also note this two hundred and fifty year period

24
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,920
has been a pretty good run for humans

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,380
featuring, you know, steam engines,

26
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,200
the internet,

27
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,340
antibiotics,

28
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:45,920
skyscrapers,

29
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,800
a stunning increase in life expectancy,

30
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,100
home pizza delivery,

31
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,500
water purification plants,

32
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,580
and landing a freaking Mini Cooper on Mars.

33
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,160
Needless to say this is not a coincidence.

34
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,900
Take for example, Adam Steltzner,

35
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,600
the lead engineer on the Curiosity Rover's descent and landing team.

36
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,300
He went to a publicly funded high school

37
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,700
before getting in both his Bachelor's degree and his Doctorate

38
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,840
from publicly subsidized universities.

39
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,700
So let me ask you a question,

40
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,840
students about to return to school.

41
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,160
How fraking psyched are you for the end of summer?

42
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,760
How psyched are to have the opportunity

43
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,660
to learn about the Universe and its inhabitants

44
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,000
for several hours a day at no cost to you?

45
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,160
The answer of course, is that if you're anything like I was,

46
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,680
you're not psyched at all.

47
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,880
I mean, a) you might be a bit of a social outcast. 
I know I was.

48
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,140
I never really learned how to shave,

49
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:25,160
and that-that's fine now, but back then,

50
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,320
when I had like the Sony My First Mustache,
 it was just a disaster.

51
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,760
And b) you may often feel like 
your studies are mind-numbing,

52
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,400
instead of mind-stimulating.

53
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,620
Like who wants to read the Taming of the Shrew?

54
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,940
You basically have to translate it from Shakespeare into English,

55
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,620
which is ridiculous because there is already

56
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,440
an excellent filmic translation available in the form of

57
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,560
Ten Things I Hate About You.

58
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,640
So if you're anything like me, you're gonna spend a lot of time whining that

59
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,860
1) none of this will ever be useful in your real life

60
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,380
And 2) your teachers are stupid.

61
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,960
And 3) math is really hard and you'll never understand it,

62
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,460
ditto physics, history is boring,

63
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,500
French is just an endless series of je ne sais pas

64
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,820
literature is an impossible hunt for symbols,

65
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,160
and physical education is an oxymoron.

66
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,820
Well here's the thing. When you watch the Curiosity Rover land,

67
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,160
it is far more moving and exciting if you understand the physics,

68
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,940
and the math, and the history behind that moment.

69
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,800
French is useful because the French do speak English, but they pretend not to.

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,560
And it's not only literature that's symbolic, all communication among people is symbolic.

71
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,380
As is consciousness itself.

72
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,580
And physical education is not an oxymoron,

73
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,280
because your body is not born knowing how to do

74
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,040
this!

75
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,980
But yes, your teachers may be stupid.

76
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,180
So are you! So am I!

77
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,560
So is everyone. (except Neil deGrasse Tyson)

78
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,120
The whole pleasure of being a human is in being stupid,

79
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,840
but learning to be less stupid together!

80
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,460
But more important than all of that, you need to remember that school is not about you!

81
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,580
School doesn't exist for your benefit, or for the benefit of your parents.

82
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,980
Schools exist for the benefit of me.

83
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,980
The reason I pay taxes for schools, even though I don't have a kid in school,

84
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,600
is that I am better off in a well-educated world.

85
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,240
Public education isn't a charity project,

86
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,280
I pay for your schools because 
I want you to grow up and make my life better.

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,200
I want you to to make me beautiful books that will bring me pleasure and consolation,

88
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,460
I want you to make me cooler cars for me to drive,

89
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,980
and drugs so that I can live a longer, healthier life.

90
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,280
I'm paying for your education in the hopes that you'll invent a microwave pizza with actually crispy crust,

91
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,260
And that you'll spread the availability of the internet

92
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,400
So that I can get more YouTube views in Zambia.

93
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,740
You education isn't just about you,

94
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,020
your nation is making an investment in you because they believe that you are worth it.

95
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,620
So the next time you're like half-asleep in class,

96
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,040
fantasizing about being a kid chosen for a special mission,

97
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,520
or wizard school or whatever,

98
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,600
please remember something: You are special!

99
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,180
And you've been chosen for a special mission that was denied to 99.9% of all humans ever.

100
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,060
We need you! We believe in you! And we're counting on you.

101
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,740
Best wishes, John Green.

102
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,440
Hank, quick postscript for people nerdy enough to be interested in education outside of class,

103
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,160
Please check out CrashCourse and SciShow,

104
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,860
our educational initiatives, link in the doobly-doo.

105
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,580
And for those of you nerdy enough to dream about being a Time-Nanny for an Evil Baby Orphanage,

106
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,260
I have great news!

107
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,800
A professional gaming company is Kickstarting an Evil Baby Orphanage card game.

108
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,900
It looks really cool, so check that out as well, link in the doobly-doo.

109
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,060
Hank, congratulations on Curiosity not crashing into Mars,

110
00:03:57,060 --> 00:00:00,000
I know that's like the highlight of your year, I will see you on Fri-
