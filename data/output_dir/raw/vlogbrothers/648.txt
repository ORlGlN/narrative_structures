00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,840
John - So Hank, we're here in Northern Florida, and yes I am wearing an inner tube,

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,240
that just sticks to my body, because you know my belly is too big.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,300
Hank - You don't need a bigger tube. It's the perfect size
John - It's all the tube you need.

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,860
Hank - It's just like the internet
John - How is it just like the internet?
Hank - We just all want bigger tubes!

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,280
John - You know in all the thoughts from places videos I try and draw out some tortured metaphor but that's the worst one yet.
