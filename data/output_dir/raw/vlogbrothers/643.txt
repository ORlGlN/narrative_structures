00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
Good Morning John, It's Friday

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,080
Say hi Ze!

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,080
Ze: Hi Ze!

4
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:08,840
So I was at Foo camp last weekend, which as far as I can tell is just a gathering of cool people.

5
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,560
You don't turn down an invitation to Foo camp,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,580
But my first reaction:

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,620
'Oh!

8
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,309
That sounds ...

9
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:14,809
hard

10
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:15,960
and scary'

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,400
Like riding a bike in this thing here.

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,600
You know, unlike riding a bike in that thing,

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,500
there's a very low chance that I'm going to break my arm going to Foo Camp,

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,740
but I'm clearly afraid of something -

15
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,720
that I won't have anything interesting to say,

16
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,960
that I'll be uncomfortable,

17
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,040
that I'll be judged by all of these amazing people and found to be wanting,

18
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,420
and we feel fear like that all the time.

19
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:37,020
've been reading a very, very, very short non-fiction book by another Foo Camp attendee that,

20
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,180
while limited in its scope, is pretty applicable to this.

21
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,180
It's called Flinch and it's available for free on the Kindle store,

22
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,040
and basically the idea is that we just need to get over our anxieties because they're stupid.

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,240
They're vestigial.

24
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,760
We evolved not only in a world that was like never going to change during our lifetimes,

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,660
like it would be the same when we were born as when we died;

26
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,300
we were also born into a much more dangerous world where it was a lot harder to get food

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,340
and shelter and sex and all of the things that we want

28
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,180
and need as people.

29
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,760
And so we're programmed that if we've found a good easy,

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,280
comfortable way of doing things, we should stick with that.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
But the big secret, of course, that our subconscious can't seem to realize,

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,840
is that we could be doing anything and there would be a very low chance of us dying.

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
The author has some homework assignments in the book,

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,300
and the first one is designed to help you identify what this feeling is so

35
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,860
that you can know when you're experiencing it and move past it.

36
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,540
And that's to turn on your shower,

37
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,980
wait for it to get really cold, and then get in.

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,260
So....

39
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,940
This does seem like an intensely bad idea.

40
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,280
Oh, that's cold.

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,920
You just do it!

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,020
Okay. It's going to be fine.

43
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,060
Overcome the flinch, Hank.

44
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,560
Wow.

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,140
Mmm.

46
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,640
This is harder than it sounds.

47
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,620
Alright.

48
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:52,200
*sounds of distress*

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,860
Enough, okay.

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,520
That's long enough.

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,340
Hot water, coming out of your wall?

52
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,640
That's just a wonderful convenience.

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,220
We gotta just be thankful for that every damn day!

54
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,820
Once I was in, it was much easier to stay in

55
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,960
than it was to get in in the first place.

56
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,940
Even though, of course,

57
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,940
it was much less pleasant once I was in.

58
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,840
So that is interesting.

59
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Foo Camp was a lot like a cold shower.

60
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,580
It was never comfortable but it was quite refreshing and interesting,

61
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,340
and I certainly didn't want to sleep.

62
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,500
Nerdfighteria has always been like a primary source of inspiration for me,

63
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,600
at least for the last five years.

64
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,360
And I've also in the last few years become increasingly obsessed with ideas that can become bigger than us.

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,940
First, you have to identify problems;

66
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,720
Second, you have to think creatively and intelligently about solutions;

67
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,200
and then you have to act.

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,060
And the acting part is probably going to be a lot more uncomfortable than a million cold showers.

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,900
We don't not volunteer because we don't have time

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,880
or we don't believe;

71
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
it's because it's hard and scary,

72
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,780
and we don't know what's going to happen when we go out and do that stuff.

73
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,020
So like I said, uh, starting with problems.

74
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,700
I want people to leave the problems that they see.

75
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,660
It can be stupid little things like 'the YouTube subscription system doesn't work very well anymore'

76
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,520
or big things like 'there are hungry people.'

77
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
And you get points, you don't actually get points,

78
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,240
but you should get points for being unique,

79
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,280
and you also get points for being someone who doesn't frequently comment on Vlogbrothers videos,

80
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,800
because we know that there are a lot of you out there.

81
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,560
I was just talking about you on my Tumblr.

82
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,900
And finally in addition to all that,

83
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,740
yes we love working on things with Nerdfighteria,

84
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,580
big and small,

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,980
and so we are re-instituting the summertime Nerdfighter book club.

86
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,980
So, together we're going to be reading Fahrenheit 451.

87
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,520
We're doing this book for two reasons:

88
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,160
one, in honor of Ray Bradbury's amazing life

89
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:35,100
and two, because apparently 50 Shades of Grey, which is basically Twilight fanfiction turned into a novel,

90
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,500
has now sold more books than Ray Bradbury did in his entire life,

91
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,100
and we think that that's messed up, man.

92
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,980
So, if you don't already have your copy order it now

93
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
or go to your local independent bookstore and buy it.

94
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,620
John, I'll see you on Monday.

95
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,500
Ze: If you look straight down, what can you see? If you really like commit to it, if you really commit to it.

96
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,960
Hank: There's a bunch of twigs and stuff.

97
00:03:52,960 --> 00:00:00,000
*Quick thank you to everyone on the nerdfighter wiki who helps write the transcripts for these videos, you are amazing human beings and true life savers who make these captions possible.*
