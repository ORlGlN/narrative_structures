00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Good morning John,

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,300
I have a song for you. It's actually for me, but I hope you like it anyway.

3
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,460
'Cos the universe is weird! I'm kinda freaking out!

4
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,600
What the heck is this all about?

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,900
Infinite unbounded sets and hadronizing gluon jets, and

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,740
We'll never understand half of what we have at hand. At least that's what I fear,

7
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,040
'Cos the universe is weird!

8
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,520
'Cos the universe is weird! I'm kinda freaking out!

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,600
What the heck is this all about?

10
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,000
Infinite unbounded sets and hadronizing gluon jets, and

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,700
We'll never understand half of what we have at hand. At least that's what I fear,

12
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,080
'Cos the universe is weird!

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,280
Yea the universe is weird! I'm kinda freaking out!

14
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,540
What the heck is this all about?

15
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,820
Infinite unbounded sets and hadronizing gluon jets, and

16
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:10,540
We'll never understand half of what we have at hand. At least that's what I fear,

17
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:13,600
'Cos the universe is weird!

18
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,700
Oh yea, oh it's so weird, it's so freaking weird!

19
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh yea, the universe is weird!

20
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,860
The universe is weird!

21
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,260
Oh why on earth is the Earth so weird?

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,100
And the universe! Oh why in the universe is the universe so weird?

23
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,700
Oh it's kinda freaking me out

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,860
I don't know if you noticed, but

25
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,820
It's freaking freaking me out, it's so weird

26
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,080
Oh it's so weird.

27
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,580
Six quick announcements. First, this song is available and links in the description

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:52,320
either on Gumroad, which is pretty easy to use or iTunes, if they have uploaded it, which they haven't, as of the filming of this.

29
00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:01,020
Second, John, for the very first time after 385 weeks on bookstore shelves, Looking for Alaska was on the New York Times' Bestseller List last week,

30
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:07,400
which is a really remarkable story for a book, and it's a really remarkable book so it deserves it, and if you, world, have not yet read the book,

31
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,160
it's becoming a classic, you should get it, there's a link in the description.

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:18,520
Third, I have seen a fair amount of DFTBA license plates in my time, but I now want to embark on a journey to collect all 50 of the states' DFTBA license plates,

33
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,280
so if you have one, or if you want to go get one, please send us a picture of it to hankandjohn@gmail.com.

34
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:32,320
Fourth, Alex Day made a freaking Nerdfighteria Sopio expansion. You can get it at a link in the description. There's a giraffe love card and a Hanklerfish.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,440
Fifth, I have been on a songwriting spree lately, so I'm going to attempt to have the next four videos of mine have songs in them.

36
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,640
And sixth, Harry and the Potters and Potter Puppet Pals are going on a long tour and I'm going to be with them on three of those dates.

37
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,120
In Portland, Olympia, and Seattle. If you wanna see me on one of those days or them on any of those other dates,

38
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,880
you should go to the link in the description.

39
00:03:50,880 --> 00:00:00,000
I hope that you're not overwhelmed by all of the links in the description. John, I will see you on Tuesday.
