00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,660
Good morning John.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,260
I wrote this song after we went on tour because people kept asking me a question

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,580
that I didn't have an answer to and this song is my answer to that question.

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,980
♫ There's somethin' happenin' on the internet and I don't really get it. ♫

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,300
♫ Once again I'll have to say "I'm not into that" but I'm sure that I'll regret it. ♫

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,960
♫ 'Cuz I know thousands of people never cared about anything more.  ♫

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,680
♫ They've spent the last six months makin' tumblrs, fanfics, and bulletin boards. ♫

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,800
♫ And I think all that excitement is great. ♫

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:37,440
♫ But when they ask I have no choice. I still have to say... ♫

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,180
♫ That I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I've never seen that show. ♫

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,320
♫ And I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I'm 31 years old. ♫

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,920
♫ And I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I'm a self-respecting dude. ♫

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,840
♫ And I don't have a favorite pony 'cuz I... ♫

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,319
♫ I just can't... ♫

15
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,339
♫ choooooose! ♫

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,260
♫ Well, Dash the Pegasus has rainbow hair and the cutest cutie mark. ♫

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,780
♫ And Apple Jack is the strongest mare, always working so hard. ♫

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,120
♫ And Flutter Shy has totally got that Marilyn vibe goin' on, ♫

19
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,760
♫ but when it comes to the beauty prize, oh Rarity's already won. ♫

20
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,180
♫ And Pinky Pies' excitement could fuel a jet plane. ♫

21
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,560
♫ But Twilight's the nerdiest, and that goes a long way. ♫

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
♫ But I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I've never seen that show. ♫

23
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,500
♫ And I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I'm 30 freakin' 1 years old. ♫

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,060
♫ And I don't have a favorite pony 'cuz I'm a self-respecting dude. ♫

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:38,380
♫ And I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I just can't choose. ♫

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,160
♫ Well my goal is to make this a better planet and I don't take that lightly. ♫

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,780
♫ I should be working my butt off all day, damn it, with any luck I might be. ♫

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,060
♫ But it's equally probable that instead of changing the world, ♫

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,780
♫ I spent the last 6 hours watching a cartoon made for little girls. ♫

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,980
♫ Oh, battles in the real world are so complexly won. ♫

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,780
♫ It's all so much simpler in Equestria. ♫

32
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,480
♫ But I don't have a favorite pony. I don't have one even though ♫

33
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,100
♫ I've spent the whole day tryin' to pick by watchin' all the episodes. ♫

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,360
♫ I don't have a favorite pony, 'cuz I'm a self respecting guy, ♫

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,020
♫ and I don't have a favorite pony 'cuz I... ♫

36
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,920
♫ I like ♫

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,080
♫ Spike! ♫

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,860
Thank you Michael Aranda, of course, for doing the effects.

39
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,840
And also to the people who put together a bunch of green screen ponies.

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,600
Woooh! Green screen ponies!

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,480
Links to their channel. Well done.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,660
I'm at LeakyCon right now. I filmed this in the past.

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,140
But I'm not gonna talk about it 'cuz you know if you're watching this you're either there or you're not.

44
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,040
But what I am gonna talk about, 'cuz John maybe you aren't as excited about this as I am,

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,520
is the Evil Baby Orphanage card game Kickstarter.

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,680
I'm a tabletop card game kind of guy and I am unashamed of that.

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,360
My original Nerdfighters song was about Magic: The Gathering, you remember?

48
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,700
You probably don't; it was a long time ago. And you may not thus remember the Evil Baby Orphanage.

49
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,580
But if you don't, it was an idea that John and I conceived in order to escape the conundrum of whether or not

50
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:54,560
to kill baby Hitler if you had the chance. 'Cuz if you have the chance to kill him you also have the chance to

51
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,520
abduct him and bring him to an Evil Baby Orphanage.

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,900
Well, the very talented people at Weird Games got their hands on this idea and when I saw it on Kickstarter

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,900
I was like "Hey guys. Guys. Guys. Guys, can I? Can I help? Can I help? Guys, can I help?"

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,660
So they gave me a look at the whole game. It's basically like you have to collect babies to get mischief points

55
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,560
and you need to get more mischief points and eventually you win.

56
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,580
But there are a bunch of mechanics where babies that have more mischief points get, like, passed

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,720
from Time Nanny to Time Nanny, also you're a Time Nanny.

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,980
And at $50,000, they're going to do a Nerdfighter expansion which will include John and me as Time Nannies.

59
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,780
You will be able to play as us!

60
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,380
But you only get that and the other expansion perks, coloring book stuff, if you pledge more than $40, so remember that.

61
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,160
And if you're seeing this video after the Kickstarter ends, it's ending very soon, like 2 or 3 days, don't fret!

62
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,320
The game will be available for sale at your local game stores, and probably at DFTBA.com.

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,300
John! I will see you right now, because you're at LeakyCon too.

64
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,120
Bye.
