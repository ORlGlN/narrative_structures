1
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,510
Bill Gates: If you can help farmers grow a
lot more, that's a fantastic thing.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:11,610
Most of these farmers don't have very good
seeds, and they can't afford fertilizer, and

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:14,160
they don't get much advice about what to grow
and how to grow it.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,679
So the upside for African agriculture is it's
possible to triple productivity.

5
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:24,669
So figuring out how a foundation can come
in with pretty modest amounts of money and

6
00:00:24,669 --> 00:00:27,999
get that productivity up, that's our dream.

7
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,519
One thing we do is we help crop research.

8
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,418
We help them create better seeds.

9
00:00:32,418 --> 00:00:36,240
But then, trying to get it to these farmers,
particularly the very poorest farmers.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,500
If you're not careful, if you improve things,
the wealthy farmers near the cities will be

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,230
the primary beneficiaries.

12
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,880
So asking people how much of your output they
have to consume themselves, and understanding

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,820
as the years are good and bad, do you have
years where you have to eat 100%, or where

14
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,360
you're actually not even getting enough?

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,090
John: Agriculture is weird because it is a
market, it is a capitalist market, but it's

16
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,509
also one that, you know, in the US, we provide
what amounts to direct assistance with crop

17
00:01:04,509 --> 00:01:05,509
insurance.

18
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:06,509
It's a weird market.

19
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:07,770
It's different from other markets.

20
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,259
In that way, it's a little bit like health,
which is also kind of a market, but also kind

21
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:12,259
of not.

22
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:18,100
Bill: Because you want people to get enough
food, because farmers are politically influential,

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,100
you're right.

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,350
Even in rich countries, where it's only employing
2% of people, the prices are very distorted.

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,590
In poor countries, even more so, because there
are some true market failures, like who's

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,820
gonna build storage, or who's gonna provide
credit.

27
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,539
John: If A) you didn't make enough money last
year, or B) you spent all of it, then that

28
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,899
becomes impossible.

29
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:44,109
So is one of the ideas of this cooperative
to try to even that out, so that that capital--you

30
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,450
have that capital going into each season?

31
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,030
Bill: Yeah, that's a huge market failure,
is that typically, banks won't take the credit

32
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,590
risk that they should, because they're going
to have a problem if, let's say, there's a

33
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,889
drought that year.

34
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,299
That bank could literally go bankrupt.

35
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:04,539
So it's not uncorrelated risk, it's correlated
risk that all your borrowers, their credit

36
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:10,750
is what they grow, and bad weather could make
every single one of them unable to repay that.

37
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:15,760
Teaching people what seeds to use, the idea
that if you buy hybrid seed instead of using

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,000
your leftover seed, that that's a huge payoff.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,890
It takes a while for people to be used to
that.

40
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,030
If you happen to do that the year when the
rain doesn't come, you're gonna be very sorry.

41
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,030
John: Right.

42
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,790
Bill: ...because you're gonna have this debt
that you may never be able to pay off.

43
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,720
John: Can foundations, can we really insulate
against that risk?

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,300
Bill: Well, the Mexican government has done
cash support, and they can adjust that based

45
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:50,330
on whether the weather's been bad or good.

46
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:56,060
If the government does these things well,
it essentially can come in and play an appropriate

47
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,020
type of crop insurance type role.

48
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,660
There is this idea of micro-insurance, you
know, on your cell phone, learning what price

49
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,470
you should get, getting more advice, even
being able to take a photo of something and

50
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,350
having somebody say, you know, what's going
wrong with your plants.

51
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:14,160
The only thing working against these farmers
is climate change.

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:19,470
Every factor is working in favor of farmer
output, self-sufficiency, better storage,

53
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:27,100
you know, amazing seeds, particularly if we
can use advanced techniques, but climate change

54
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,570
is working against them.

55
00:03:28,570 --> 00:00:00,000
So mostly, it's a positive story.
