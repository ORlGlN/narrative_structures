00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
Good Morning John, it's Friday. Today I wanna talk about young people

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,060
but first, I wanna talk about evolution.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,780
there is a thing called mutagenesis

4
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,100
it's when a new change is introduced

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,640
to the genome of an organism.

6
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,780
By far the most common effect of a mutation is nothing.

7
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,675
Like

8
00:00:15,675 --> 00:00:19,000
it changes an area of the genome that doesn't code for anything

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,455
or the protein changes but it doesn't change enough for it to matter.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,120
Occasionally though, the mutation will allow the cell to divide uncontrolled, and that's cancer.

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,900
But also even more rarely the change is good.

12
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,465
It allows the organism to digest a new kind of food or

13
00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:35,345
it makes it bigger when it needs to be bigger

14
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:40,180
or smaller when it needs to be smaller or hairier when it's colder out or less hairy if its hot.

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,575
While, on average, mutagenesis is really bad for individuals, without it there would either be

16
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:50,785
no life on earth or

17
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,415
there would be one kind of life

18
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,020
and it would be little single-celled sludge.

19
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,460
Genetic mutagens are things like sunlight

20
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,265
other sources of radiation, certain oxidizing compounds,

21
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:04,425
a bunch of different crazy hydrocarbons.

22
00:01:04,535 --> 00:01:07,485
Those things create mutations inside of organisms.

23
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:10,120
But it turns out that evolution seems to actually select

24
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,720
for a certain amount of mutagenesis.

25
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,195
Like, it wants some mutation to happen. There's a balance.

26
00:01:16,195 --> 00:01:18,115
So there's external mutagenesis,

27
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,420
and there also seems to be internal intentional mutagenesis.

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,960
And I started thinking about young people as cultural mutagens back when I was still a youth.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,280
It sounds bad but it's not.

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,020
Culture obviously can be understood evolutionarily. Like the things that work stick around.

31
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,020
That doesn't mean that those things are good or bad, it just means they're working.

32
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,300
That can be institutions like marriage or fast food restaurants.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,340
It can be ideas like human rights or tribalism.

34
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,700
And culture mutates. Like, from the perspective of a biologist, it mutates extremely quickly.

35
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,000
But also, it needs to.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,520
Look, I am now what could probably be called middle-aged, and I am frightened by

37
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,560
the pace of change as I witness it as I continue to live in the world.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Fairly regularly, I will think to myself:

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,180
"Okay, how about, I don't know, we spend a little bit of time getting used to the

40
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,360
current complete revolution in how humans communicate with each other

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,980
before moving on to revolutionizing the entire global financial system with cryptocurrencies?"

42
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,015
Like, I don't - take a - just slow down, a little bit!

43
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:27,000
Get on a boat, do a little bit of fishing, have a couple drinks, noodle around on the guitar.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,880
And now I'm Jimmy Buffett, great. Thanks. Wonderful. That's what I wanted.

45
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,460
Young people, for a number of actual, physiological reasons, as well as practical ones and cultural ones and psychological ones

46
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,300
I think are built to create change.

47
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:45,435
To take risks, to avoid stability, to mutate culture, to make things,

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,520
to imagine a world that's deeply different from the one that I've gotten really used to.

49
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:59,520
I am worried about what happens to individuals and also even culture at large when the wrong change takes hold.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,220
But also, I'm old! [laughs]

51
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,460
I recognize that society without change is destined for a sorry, sad end.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,680
And I think that a really important thing to remember here is that, unlike genetic evolution,

53
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,220
cultural evolution can be done with intent. It can be done carefully and thoughtfully.

54
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,520
Which is why I want to say to people who talk to young people for a living,

55
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,060
This is an extremely important job that you have. You may not be being valued by society correctly,

56
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,980
but that does not mean that you are not creating that value.

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,780
And, I want to say, to the 12 to 24 year olds out there,

58
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:40,060
you might feel powerless, sometimes, but in some ways, right now, you are the most powerful you will ever be

59
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,320
because you can imagine the world in a way that I no longer can.

60
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:50,820
And that's not an indictment of getting older, it's a recognition that different life stages serve different roles in culture.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,040
So use your fuel wisely, use it often, and thanks for inspiring us old folks.

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
