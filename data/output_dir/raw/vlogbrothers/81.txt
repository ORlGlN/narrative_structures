00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,355
Good morning, John. I have some good news.

2
00:00:02,355 --> 00:00:04,875
Some bad news, but some good news. There's this number

3
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,965
that people use as part of, uh, our understanding of public health

4
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,105
in the world. Kind of a surrogate for the overall health

5
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,205
of a population, though not a great one. It's called

6
00:00:13,205 --> 00:00:16,254
life expectancy. Very simply, it is the average age at which

7
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:19,635
a person in our country will die.  That number has gone up a lot

8
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:22,475
in the last 200 years for people but

9
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:25,745
interestingly, it's also gone up for you...

10
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:28,875
person watching.  And it goes up for you

11
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:30,925
every day. And probably not

12
00:00:30,925 --> 00:00:33,815
for the reason you're thinking.  So the life expectancy of the average dude in the

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,195
U.S. is 76. But for me,

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,180
it's 78. That's nice!  I got an extra couple of years

15
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:42,800
on the average dude.  Look at me! How did I do that?

16
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,600
Well, here's a statistic that might sound a little more surprising at first but will

17
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,585
help you figure out why. The average person will die

18
00:00:49,585 --> 00:00:52,420
at 76, but the average 76 year old

19
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:55,455
will die at 86.  And the average 86

20
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,460
year old ,

21
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,320
they will die at 91. So I was hanging out with Thomas Franker earlier

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,420
today of college info geek, he's 26 years old.

23
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,224
His life expectancy is 77 years old.

24
00:01:05,224 --> 00:01:08,265
Mine is 78. What is up with that is that he has to live

25
00:01:08,265 --> 00:01:10,985
for like 11 more years

26
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,115
before he gets to my age. Very sadly,  some

27
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:17,225
people will die, not very many, but some,  between the

28
00:01:17,225 --> 00:01:23,520
ages of 26 and 37. I, on the other hand,  because I am 37, will never have died

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,900
between the ages of 26 and 37. I just can't do it.

30
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,700
So every hour you live, your life expectancy goes up.

31
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,680
The number of hours you have left to live goes down

32
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:37,620
but not at one hour per hour.

33
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,620
Every hour that passes – this makes my brain hurt –

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:46,500
you are closer to death, but you are less than one hour closer to death.

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,000
And that's a small comfort.

36
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,000
I had this dumb idea, when I was younger,

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,160
that since the life expectancy of a person in America is 78,

38
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,820
that once you got to 78 you could just die at any time.

39
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,820
Like a stiff wind blows and you're just like "I'm out"

40
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,680
But it is not until

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,515
You are 114 that you have

42
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,820
A better than average chance of dying in the next

43
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,875
365 days. WHAT?

44
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:10,925
Now to be fair, there are many years before that when you have

45
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,765
A better than average chance of dying in the next thousand days

46
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:15,255
Which is why most people don't get

47
00:02:15,255 --> 00:02:18,035
To 114. But by and large, statistically

48
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,680
Everyone can expect to have at least a year

49
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,895
When you turn 114 though, you have a more than 50% chance of

50
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:27,155
Hitting 115, that's the statistics

51
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:30,045
Another thing worth noting is that life expectancy takes a snapshot of

52
00:02:30,045 --> 00:02:32,425
This very moment with the death rates for

53
00:02:32,425 --> 00:02:35,505
Every person at every age. It is actually not a measure of when

54
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:38,455
You will die, because that death rate

55
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:41,485
Will change over time, and everyone knows that. And mostly

56
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:44,520
We hope, barring some kind of catastrophic solar flare induced apocalypse

57
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,840
Death rates will continue to go down. Like the life expectancy for a 25 year old

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,740
In 1960 was about 70 years old, but it turned out

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,140
That that 25 year old, or the population of 25 year olds

60
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,900
Ended up dying significantly after the age of 70, so yeah, that thing

61
00:02:57,905 --> 00:03:01,175
Which doesn't actually have to do with life expectancy the statistic

62
00:03:01,175 --> 00:03:02,555
Makes your life longer

63
00:03:02,865 --> 00:03:05,955
And nobody has to die, so that John, is a plus

64
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,645
I guess if you weren't getting enough death talk on Dear Hank and John

65
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:11,705
Here it is on Vlogbrothers. Speaking of, three things, the first one

66
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,125
This animation that somebody made of a

67
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,265
Dear Hank and John segment where we talk bizarre pizza deliveries

68
00:03:17,265 --> 00:03:20,285
Which I liked. Second, Patreon made a really great video

69
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:22,845
About our production studio

70
00:03:22,845 --> 00:03:25,805
Here in Missoula, and I'd like to share that as well

71
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,015
It's just fantastic. And lastly,

72
00:03:28,015 --> 00:03:31,095
I know this took a little bit of time, but we finally have all of the

73
00:03:31,095 --> 00:03:34,105
Grant recipients for the Project for Awesome, and have sent all of their

74
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:37,095
Cheques off. We sent a lot of them earlier, but we have sent the last ones

75
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:40,365
Not all perks have been sent, but most of them have

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,980
I've been working really hard on mine, and I'm sorry. And number four

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,580
I'm going to VidCon next week, AHHHHH!

78
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,855
There's still tickets avaliable if you want to come check it out

79
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,915
And John, I think that I will see you next in the real world

80
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:56,515
In Los Angeles, before I see you next on the computer screen

81
00:03:56,515 --> 00:00:00,000
So looking forward to that
