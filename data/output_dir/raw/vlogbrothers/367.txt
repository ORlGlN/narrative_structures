1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,120
Good morning Hank, it's Monday.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Special bonus video!

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,759
I am in my home -- actually, I won't be in
my home by the time you watch this but I am

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:06,759
right now.

5
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:12,429
It feels so good to be home with my family
and my 2011 FA cup championship trophy...

6
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:16,268
and my fox hat and my copy of An Imperial
Affliction that Hazel read in the TFIOS movie

7
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:19,470
- it's not a real book, it's just a prop,
it's the same four pages I wrote over and

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:20,540
over and over again.

9
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,540
But mostly my family.

10
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,720
It's just very nice to be home for a couple
of days.

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,670
In other news the Project for Awesome starts
in five days, and Hank I want to make sure

12
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,380
that everyone in Nerdfighteria is ready, hence
the bonus video.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,820
First, quick overview for new nerdfighters:
the Project for Awesome is that annual 48-hour

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,280
event where we raise lots of money for charity
and also lots of people make videos about

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
charity.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,800
By the way, if you're going to make a Project
for Awesome video, I highly suggest you watch

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,390
this tutorial by Hank, about how to make a
great P4A video.

18
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:46,460
As Hank points out, one of the ways of imagining
a good Project for Awesome video is that it's

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,870
a kind of advertisement for the charity you're
trying to get people to vote for at projectforawesome.com.

20
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,160
If you're not going to make a Project for
Awesome video, that's OK there are still tons

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,480
of ways to participate!

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,909
You can watch and share Project for Awesome
videos and the Project for Awesome livestream

23
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,089
and of course you can vote for the charities
you want the donated money to go to at projectforawesome.com.

24
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:07,980
Also, if you can afford it, I hope you'll
consider donating via the Project for Awesome

25
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,250
IndieGoGo where there will be some pretty
awesome perks.

26
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,660
I want to thank everybody who's donated their
time and effort on this front from Natalie

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,650
Tran to Troye Sivan to all the nerdfighters
who made the nerdfighter art perks, like these

28
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:22,240
amazing French the Llama paintings.

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,990
There will be a lot of one-of-a-kind perks
that you've never been able to get before

30
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,770
and will never be able to get again, but more
on that once the IndieGoGo starts.

31
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,010
And lastly, how to divide up the money.

32
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,650
So Hank, we asked for nerdfighteria's thoughts
on this a few weeks ago.

33
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,850
The biggest concern that we heard was making
sure that the Project for Awesome can still

34
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,930
be a place where small charities get important
funding.

35
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,080
So here's what we're going to try this year.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:44,970
If you donate on or before Day 1 of the Project
for Awesome, your money will be split between

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,970
Save the Children and Partners in Health,
two charities that nerdfighteria has worked

38
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,020
with a lot for many years.

39
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,890
They're both rated extremely highly by sites
that measure charity efficacy, and they both

40
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,920
have great reputations around the world for
doing good and efficient work to address poverty

41
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,930
and disease.

42
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,480
So this will allow us to decrease world suck;
also, it will allow us to at least, like,

43
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,850
two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in
matching donations, which is very good.

44
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,389
However, we're going to save a lot of the
perks for Day 2 and after of the fundraiser,

45
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:15,439
because that money will be split among charities
chosen by nerdfighteria, which, if history

46
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,239
is any indication, many of which will be small
and will do a wide variety of kinds of world

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,239
suck decreasing.

48
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:25,780
Again, those charities will be chosen by your
votes at projectforawesome.com, so vote carefully

49
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,420
and thoughtfully, so everyone can give however
they would prefer; I'm going to probably give

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,420
both ways.

51
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,420
You can do that too.

52
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,099
I know this seems like a huge info dump and
I haven't even talked about the fact that

53
00:02:33,099 --> 00:02:36,359
there's gonna be a 48-hour livestream that
never stops and is gonna be tons and tons

54
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,480
of fun, featuring lots of your favorite YouTubers.

55
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,409
It's gonna be fun, if you're gonna make a
video upload it noon Eastern Time on Friday.

56
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:45,200
Hank, in the meantime you will actually see
me again tomorrow.

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank, don't forget to be awesome.
