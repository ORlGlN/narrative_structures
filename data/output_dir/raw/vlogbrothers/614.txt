00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,740
2,083 days ago I made a video and I put it up on the Vlogbrothers channel,

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,720
and then a day after that, you uploaded your first video to a different channel,

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
because we didn't understand how YouTube works.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,640
Since then, a lot has happened to us and to the world.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,240
You got a new baby, I got a new dog.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,480
We got the last Harry Potter book, we got a new president,

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,020
we found a new fundamental particle of physics.

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,140
Our videos went from sort of disgustingly grainy 240p

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,340
all the way up to crisp, beautiful 1080p,

11
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,580
and John, you and I, we made 1000 videos,

12
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,800
and John, that is amazing, I am proud of us.

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,040
That's an amazing number, but it's not the most amazing number.

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:44,140
Each one of those videos has been watched an average of 250,000 times

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,760
for a total of a quarter of a billion views!

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,560
If all of those videos were watched all the way through,

17
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,400
which of course they weren't, because some of them are pretty silly,

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:58,100
that would be 1,500 years of human life spent watching our videos,

19
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:00,060
and that is a number that I would feel bad about

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,260
if I didn't feel like we had actually done some pretty cool things with that time.

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,060
$300,000 raised and thousands of videos produced for charities through the Project for Awesome,

22
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,700
thousands of bracelets sold for This Star Won't Go Out,

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,520
over $1,000,000 loaned through the Nerdfighter group on Kiva.org,

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,920
hundreds of deep thoughts from dozens of places,

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,420
and Tumblogs full of GIFs (jifs)... or GIFs (gifs), whichever you prefer.

26
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:27,360
We've spent a lot of that time embarrassing ourselves or doing nasty things to ourselves,

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,860
which I do not regret in the slightest.

28
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,400
You took advantage of your son's cuteness

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,560
JOHN: Henry, we're never gonna go viral unless you bite my finger!

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,880
HANK: I took advantage of my dog's derpiness,

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,180
I sang songs about quarks, and ponies, and Harry Potter, and Helen Hunt.

32
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,080
Helen Hunt tweeted to me about my song about her.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:48,080
I invented 2D glasses and turned Pride and Prejudice into a video blog.

34
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,760
We went on tour, Catherine and I beat Super Mario Brothers Wii U,

35
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,820
and the Swindon Town Swoodilypoopers won the FA Cup!

36
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,800
JOHN: Oh he missed! Oh! We won the FA cup!

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,660
HANK: We've been on the front page of USA Today, of the New York Times, and, more importantly, of Reddit.

38
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,020
We made new things that we could never even have conceived of without the support of this community.

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,120
The Foundation to Decrease World Suck is a real non-profit now.

40
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
We've started educational channels that both have more than 200,000 subscribers.

41
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,460
We started a record label, and a web series, and a conference.

42
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,460
I got to sing a song with George Watsky and Felicia Day.

43
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,580
We've made friends with really remarkable and talented people from all over the world.

44
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,260
We've helped create and define this creative community that I think is bound for really amazing things.

45
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,600
Almost every video has been a joy to make and every one has been a joy to watch,

46
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
and in all those years, I have never missed a scheduled day of Vlogbrothers,

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,100
and you, John, you've only missed one, and I forgive you 'cause you were in the hospital.

48
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,500
JOHN: I'm sick, that's my IV port.

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,820
HANK: There's a lot of numbers in this video because I'm trying to quantify something that can't be quantified.

50
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,700
Here's a number: two.

51
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,520
It's the number of brothers who are the luckiest brothers in ever.

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,880
So thank you all for that.

53
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,800
Thank you if you ever watched a video or participated in a project,

54
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,780
or donated to any of the charities that we have supported.

55
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,480
Thanks for helping us be better people and for travelling with us on this journey,

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,380
and John and I will continue to do our best to not let you down and to make great content that you like watching,

57
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,860
and also to try and make the world a better place.

58
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,620
John...

59
00:03:17,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Auto power off? Why the f...?
