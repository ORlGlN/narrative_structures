00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:01,380
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,380
PAIN!

3
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,850
Today is inspired by a comment on John's video
about me needing to be punished.

4
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:08,429
I am going to talk about the science of pain,
while experiencing pain.

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:11,820
Let's start out with pain that is detected
by the systems designed to detect pain.

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,320
[SLAP]
This is called nociceptive pain.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,600
It's the kind of pain that we need, something
bad is happening, and so our brain is like

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,600
"THIS IS UNPLEASANT, RUN AWAY!"

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,850
There are three different kinds of nociceptive
pain, first superficial somatic nociceptive

10
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,850
pain.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,240
This is basically skin-based pain.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,540
We have TONS of pain receptors in our skin
because it's our first line of defense, so

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,560
we need to gather a lot of information.

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,410
When I get whipped, my skin can feel every
single lash of the whip as a separate pain.

15
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,051
Deep somatic pain, on the other hand, is what
we feel when our muscles are burning and when

16
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:41,810
we have to strain or a sprain or a broken
bone.

17
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,260
It's a less specific pain, but it can extremely
intense.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,989
This is a weird kind of pain test, right now
my muscles are undergoing anaerobic glycolysis,

19
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:49,980
which is increasing the acidity of my muscles.

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,870
Neurons are detecting that increase in acidity
and relaying that signal to my brain as pain.

21
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,250
And, WOW, WOW, that's painful!

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,250
ARRRRGH!

23
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,219
The final type of nociceptive pain is visceral
pain.

24
00:01:00,219 --> 00:01:03,530
This is usually pretty vague and distant,
but can also be very intense.

25
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,640
For women, think of cramps.

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,799
For guys, think of testicular injuries.

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not going to demonstrate this; it would
be dangerous.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,581
Now in addition to nociceptive pain, the other
kind of common pain is neuropathic pain, when

29
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:16,000
your nerves are damaged or malfunction and
send pain signals when they shouldn't.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,460
One of the only big nerves that runs close
to the surface of the skin is right here,

31
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,890
your ulnar nerve, and if you whack it OOOOWWWWWW
I did it aaaah I achieved - goal accomplished!

32
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,950
Funny bone... that's, that's your neuropathic
pain.

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,360
I didn't think I was going to do it so good.

34
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,030
Referred pain, on the other hand, is when
the source of the pain gets mixed up by your

35
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,030
nervous system.

36
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,070
Yes there's a stimulus, but no it is not being
received in the right place.

37
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,330
AAAAAAAAAAAAA OWWW!

38
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,840
My eyes were watering!

39
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,360
Oh good thank God I was recording; I thought
I wasn't recording for a second.

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,210
And your nociceptive pain system can also
be tricked and to understand this we kind

41
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,890
of have to understand how the entire nervous
system works.

42
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,770
Cells that detect sensation, whether that's
pain or light or smell, they all kind of work

43
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:54,770
the same way.

44
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,299
They spend almost all their time maintaining
an ion gradient across the membrane of the

45
00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:00,390
cell, so there's a different charge inside
the cell than outside.

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,259
They also, on the surface of the cells, have
these channels that when opened, equalize

47
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,689
that ion gradient, so they become neutrons.

48
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,259
And at the surface of those channels, there's
a protein that's designed to open the channel

49
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,889
when a specific thing happens.

50
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,620
That circumstance can be the presence of salt
or heat or sound or light.

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,230
This is how we detect everything.

52
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,230
All of our sensations.

53
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,680
But sometimes, circumstances
that these surface proteins weren't designed

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,599
to respond to nevertheless activate them.

55
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:26,530
For example, there is a protein called TPRV1
that's designed to open a channel in response

56
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,060
to heat, acidity, or abrasion.

57
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,010
But it also, just by chance, opens in the
presence of a molecule called

58
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,010
capsaicin.

59
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,180
Capsaicin is entirely harmless, it does no
damage to your skin, but it does open that

60
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,819
channel so it is detected by your brain as
pain.

61
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,680
And capsaicin is the chemical that makes chili
peppers hot.

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,920
OOOH.

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
AAAALALALA

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,010
The burning that I'm experiencing right now
has nothing to do actual damage inside of

65
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,010
my mouth.

66
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,440
It is purely a biological accident, and my
body does not believe it!

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,819
Now, pain is an important system.

68
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,730
We live inside of our bodies; we would be
nothing without them, so we have to protect

69
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,730
them.

70
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:05,360
People who are born without the ability to
sense pain often die before adulthood.

71
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,140
But it's not like a super well designed system
or anything.

72
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,640
It's extremely old.

73
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,380
It's a holdover from ages and ages of evolution
ago.

74
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,000
It leaves a lot of opportunities for things
to go wrong, and so many people have to deal

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,270
with chronic pain that is extremely difficult
to manage.

76
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:24,110
But for most of us, though inelegant and unpleasant,
pain is, oddly enough, something we should

77
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,430
be thankful for.

78
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,120
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,190
Today is inspired by a comment on John's video
about me needing to be punished.

80
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,040
I am going to talpahbababalablahaha lalala.

81
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,540
Me needing to be plalalalala.

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,790
Me needing to be- me needing to be memeneeding
beebee.

83
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,629
Tahmah needibala la la LA la la.

84
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:41,480
Oh my god it got so- first sentence of the
video.

85
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,680
Doesn't hurt, that doesn't hurt, that hurt.

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,820
Lindsey: I don't know about this!

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,820
Hank: You can do it!

88
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,820
AAAAAAH!!!

89
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,820
Lindsey: I'm so sorry!

90
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Hank: No it wasn't that bad.

91
00:03:50,820 --> 00:00:00,000
[singing] Denver the last dinosaur, he's my
friend and a whole lot more.
