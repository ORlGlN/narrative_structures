00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday. Happy 2018!

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,740
I really wanna bring it in 2018, like that's my main goal for the year

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,960
but in order to do that, I have to decide like, you know, what to bring.

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:13,260
So I wanna talk about three things I wanna help bring into the world this year

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,780
because you know if you promise to do something and people have heard  that promise,

6
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,260
it's more likely that you'll actually do it.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,900
First, in 2018 I want to collaborate with my wife to make at least four episodes

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,380
of a new YouTube series called "Cooking History"

9
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,000
to be uploaded at least initially here on the Vlogbrothers channel.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,520
My wife Sarah produces an amazing channel with PBS Digital called "The Art Assignment"

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,440
and one of her series over there is called "Art Cooking"

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,660
where she will make, for instance, a huge crawfish tower

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,840
that Salvador Dali once made, while also talking about his life and work.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,640
It's such a brilliant series because you learn about food and cooking

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,340
while also learning about art. Link below, by the way.

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,620
Right, so this year we're going to try to do the same thing with history,

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,960
attempting recipes from different periods of history

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,320
while learning about that period and also how food shaped history.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,580
So we'll consider, for instance, what French bread tasted like

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,740
in the run-up to the 1789 bread riots that presaged the French Revolution.

21
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,239
We'll also attempt to make porridge from 3,700 years ago. If you have any other ideas,

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,459
please leave them in comments.

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,940
Okay, thing number 2! I want to make at least ten episodes in 2018

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:11,840
of a new podcast called "The Anthropocene Reviewed"

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,920
where I review different aspects of the human-centered planet.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,400
This started out as a joke between Hank and me, but I have decided to actually do it.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,200
The first episode reviews Canada geese, the animal, and Diet Dr. Pepper, the soda.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,740
Here's a little excerpt:

29
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,980
"The man who popularized America's greatest soft drink was named Woodrow Wilson Clemens,

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,120
but he preferred to be called Foots, a nickname that he picked up in high school

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,920
due to his oddly shaped toes.

32
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,260
Foots took Dr. Pepper from a regional brand to a global juggernaut because he understood exactly what

33
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,200
made Dr. Pepper significant.

34
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,000
"I've always maintained," he said, "you cannot tell anyone what Dr. Pepper tastes like because it's so different.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,260
It's not an apple, it's not an orange, it's not a strawberry,

36
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,040
it's not a root beer, it's not even a cola."

37
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,840
Cola, after all, is derived from cocoa leaves and vanilla, two real-world flavors.

38
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,500
Sprite has that lemon-lime taste, purple soda is ostensibly grape flavored.

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,560
But Dr. Pepper has no real-world analogue.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
In fact, U.S. trademark courts have tackled this issue

41
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,440
categorizing Dr. Pepper and its knockoffs as pepper sodas although they contain no pepper

42
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,680
and the "pepper" in Dr. Pepper refers not to the spice, but either to someone's actual name or else to pep,

43
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,840
the feeling that Dr. Pepper supposedly fills you with.

44
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,200
It's the only category of soda named not for what it tastes like,

45
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,135
but instead for how it makes you feel."

46
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,480
Get ready to know a lot about Diet Dr. Pepper!

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,280
The first episode of The Anthropocene Reviewed will hopefully be up by the end of January.

48
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,940
Okay, lastly an idea that is not yet well-formulated and may not launch till later in 2018, if at all,

49
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,720
I would like to do another podcast because, you know, the world doesn't have enough of them,

50
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,120
about an old book that nobody reads anymore.

51
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,000
The book I'm thinking of at the moment, although this may change, is Tom Grogan by Francis Hopkinson Smith

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,780
which is a book about an Irish-American woman who adopts the name Tom Grogan

53
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,400
from her maybe dead husband and then becomes a successful dock worker.

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,660
It's a weird book and what's weirder is that it was the best-selling novel in the entire United States

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,920
in 1896 and its author was wildly famous.

56
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,940
But today it's been out of print for many decades and is almost entirely forgotten.

57
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:14,760
P.S. The author of that book, Francis Hopkinson Smith, also designed and built the base of the Statue of Liberty.

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,120
So maybe that book, maybe another one, but some book that nobody reads anymore

59
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,480
from a deeply polarized time in American history that might have some relevance for us.

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,220
So that's it. I really want to spend this year trying new things while also not neglecting the things I currently do.

61
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,720
It's nerve-wracking to talk about goals you haven't accomplished yet

62
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,025
but I also think it can help increase accountability.

63
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:34,835
So if you have a moment and have any feedback on any of my ideas,

64
00:03:34,835 --> 00:03:37,245
please let me know because there's still time to change all of them.

65
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:40,285
But also if you want, maybe leave a goal of your own in comments

66
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:43,325
so that if nothing else you can return to that comment in 12 months

67
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:46,325
and be like, "Hey! I did that thing I said I was going to do."

68
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:49,125
Hank, I'm going to go back to writing about the astonishing history of Diet Dr. Pepper now.

69
00:03:49,125 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy New Year! I will see you on Friday.
