1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,060
Good morning, Hank, it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:03,180
It's actually Monday, but tomorrow is a travel day.

3
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,140
Oh hi there, half-finished 3 AM room service dinner.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:08,580
Let's look outside and see where I am.

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:13,420
Apparently, I'm in Paris! Awesome.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,620
Why is there a pool? Also, why is Italy across the street?

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,740
Ugh! I'm in Las Vegas, aren't I?

8
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,340
Hank, as you well know, I have been to Las Vegas once before for my bachelor party

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,220
which we called "Nerds Do Vegas."

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,980
Hank, I don't know if you've seen the movie "The Hangover" but as I'm sure you remember,

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,840
my bachelor party was the exact opposite of that.

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,620
However Hank, when we were in Las Vegas, you did gamble.

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,680
Hold on, I gotta go buy a razor. Walk with me. I should put on pants first.

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,020
As I recall, you played a game called Casino War. You walked up to the table,

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,920
placed the minimum bet, won the bet, walked away, and retired from gambling a winner.

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,000
But Hank, because I am the naughty brother, I am a much more aggressive gambler.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,640
So Hank last night I sat down at the roulette table at about 11 PM with one hundred dollars.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,760
Three hours later, I left the casino with: one hundred TEN dollars.

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,500
Now Hank, I don't like to brag but I am an extremely good roulette player.

20
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,780
What makes me so good? Well for one thing I have a passion for the game

21
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,540
because I love tiny balls.

22
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,680
That's why I love golf, Rube Goldberg machines, and Jezzball.

23
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,340
What else has tiny balls?

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,720
"What do you do for a living, John Green?"

25
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,420
Well, I sit around in hotel rooms and try to think of things with tiny balls.

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Mmm, you are delicious, last night's French fries.

27
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,220
Anyway Hank, here's the key to playing roulette.

28
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,620
You have to understand that, over time, you're going to lose all your money.

29
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't mean you're sometimes going to lose all your money,

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
I mean you're ALWAYS going to lose ALL of your money.

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,440
So the key to success is to bet as little as possible as infrequently as possible

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,380
and every time the cocktail waitress asks if you want a Sprite, you say yes.

33
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:47,700
And since the Sprites are "free," that way even if you lose, you still got four Sprites for your $100.

34
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,480
Ugghhhhhhhh. Of course, this strategy also works for drinks that aren't Sprite.

35
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:56,560
Ultimately for me Hank, gambling isn't so much a reminder of probability as it is a reminder of perspective.

36
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,220
I mean, walking home from the casino last night, I felt like I'd had a pretty successful evening.

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,680
I met some Canadian chaps, I got to watch one of my beloved tiny balls spin around a wheel for three hours...

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,440
...plus I got quite a few free drinks, and I won ten whole dollars!

39
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,000
But Hank, here in the cold gray light of the morning after, those free drinks just feel like a

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,200
slight headache and liquid calories I'm gonna have to walk off on the treadmill desk

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,820
and I can't help but feel like for all my labor last night,

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,560
I made less than $4 per hour.

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,320
In short Hank, I may be the older brother but when it comes to gambling and also so much else,

44
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,960
you are the wiser one. Okay I have to go give a speech to people who work at colleges.

45
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,400
High school nerdfighters, I will definitely tell these people to accept ALL of you to ALL of the colleges.

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Hank, I will see you on Friday!

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,400
(dying sounds)

48
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,760
P.S. Hank, airport, grey speckled walls, etc.,

49
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,160
That video was recorded before Hurricane Sandy came ashore and I just wanted to say:

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,920
Although I realize that most nerdfighters currently without power

51
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,620
aren't spending their cell batteries, like, watching YouTube, stay safe.

52
00:02:52,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Also, bitterballen! Tiny delicious balls. And Dippin' Dots.
