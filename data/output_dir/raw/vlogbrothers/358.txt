00:00:00,099 --> 00:00:02,840
Gooood morning Hank, it's Sunday. Special
bonus video!

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,299
So as you know, for the past couple of years
Nerdfighteria has been sponsoring AFC Wimbledon,

3
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,961
an actual professional soccer team in England.
They play in League 2, so called because it

4
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:15,600
is the fourth tier of English soccer, and
they're just an amazing club: they're owned

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,640
by their fans, they were the first football
club in England to take a stand against homophobia,

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,539
and they worked their way up all the way from
the bottom of the amateur ranks, the ninth

7
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,820
tier of football, to being a full-time professional
team. It's an amazing story. By the way, we

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,710
pay for the sponsorship by sending AFC Wimbledon
all the advertising revenue from our channel

9
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,350
hankgames, so called because only John plays
games on it.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,989
Anyway, Hank, this year we were able to increase
the size of our sponsorship so we could actually

11
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:45,399
get on their pants. We are on the shorts of
the actual AFC Wimbledon uniform! There's

12
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,699
even these awesome AFC Wimbledon scarves that
have DFTBA on them -- by the way, these are

13
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:53,320
back in stock at dftba.com, all the royalties
go to the club -- and perhaps because they

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,329
are constantly being reminded by their shorts
not to forget to be awesome, AFC Wimbledon

15
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,600
have had a great season this year, Hank.

16
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,180
They're twelfth in their league, which sounds
bad, but for a club that's owned not by a

17
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,970
rich person but by a bunch of regular people,
it's excellent. And, in the big nationwide

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,340
competition known as the F.A. Cup, they have,
for the first time, made it to round three,

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,530
the round when, like, all the big teams enter
the competition.

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,530
So that means that AFC Wimbledon could have
been drawn against Manchester United or Arsenal

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,780
or Chelsea; they could have made more from
one of those games than they make in twenty

22
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,189
years of nerdfighter sponsorships. Now, then
again, they also could have been drawn against,

23
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:29,109
like, Yeovil Town, so I was very nervous on
the Paper Towns set when I was watching the

24
00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:30,109
draw come in.

25
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,060
And then, in the middle of a take of the movie,
I shouted, "Are you FRENCH THE LLAMA kidding

26
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:38,180
me?!", and thereby ruined the take of the
movie, because AFC Wimbledon had been drawn

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,060
against... Liverpool football club, the team
that I have supported for my entire adult

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,060
life.

29
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,170
Hank, I know this sounds weird to people who
don't care about sports, but Liverpool really

30
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,070
has helped me through some of the hardest
times in my life. Hank, as you know, Liverpool

31
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,119
is an embarrassingly large part of my life.
I mean, Hank, the day both my children came

32
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,280
home from the hospital, I showed them Liverpool's
Champions League Final victory over AC Milan

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,380
because I wanted it to be the first thing
they ever saw on a screen.

34
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,539
So the football club I love most in the world
versus the football club that literally has

35
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,389
DFTBA on their shorts. What's a guy to do?
Well, Hank, in my case, fly with the Yeti

36
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,889
to London for the game -- in fact, we live
in about two hours.

37
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,140
By the way, Hank, the game is on American
television at 3 P.M. Eastern on the cable

38
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,510
network Fox Sports One. So you can watch the
game and, like, see the nerdfighter advertisements

39
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,510
by the side of the field.

40
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,470
If you're a nerdfighter who doesn't care about
sports, and your parents just don't understand,

41
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,140
this is a great opportunity to connect. They'll
be like, "What is this strange cult that you're

42
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:30,180
a part of that sponsors fourth-tier English
soccer teams?" and you'll be like, "Ah, that's

43
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,470
not even weird. They're also trying to genetically
engineer puppy-sized elephants."

44
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,970
As for who I'm going to support, Hank, in
the end I -- I looked way down deep into the

45
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,660
darkness inside of me at my very core and
what I saw there was a guy who really does

46
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,560
intensely and irrationally care about the
community that is Liverpool football club,

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,590
but ultimately a guy who just has to root
for the team with DFTBA on their shorts.

48
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:55,310
Like, in some ways, the question is, "What
do you care about more, Liverpool or Nerdfighteria,

49
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:00,820
as symbolized in this case by AFC Wimbledon,
and then there's no contest! Obviously, Nerdfighteria!"

50
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:05,190
Augh, but even so, Hank, I do not recommend
divided loyalties. It's extremely stressful.

51
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,410
Now, of course, some of you argue that who
I choose to support matters nothing to the

52
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,080
actual game, and to you I say, " Well yes,
but the sport also doesn't matter; it's just

53
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,930
a bunch of people trying to kick a ball into
a net." We make it meaningful by caring about

54
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,060
it. That doesn't just go for sports; it goes
for lots of stuff.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,320
OK, Hank, I have to go get on an airplane
now so I can spend 14 hours in England. And

56
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,590
lastly, I just want to say a special thank
you to everyone who watches the AFC Wimbledon

57
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:33,450
Wimbly Womblys on hankgames, because you made
this possible. As it says on AFC Wimbledon's

58
00:03:33,450 --> 00:00:00,000
shorts, don't forget to be awesome.
