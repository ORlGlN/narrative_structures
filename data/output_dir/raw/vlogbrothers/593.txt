1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Good morning, Hank. It's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:05,500
Why is this fellow, given to me by a Nerdfighter in Germany, doing his happy dance?

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,460
Because Amazon.com just named The Fault In Our Stars one of the ten best books of 2012.

4
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,380
I don't mean books for teenagers, I mean overall books, like I'm right behind

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,900
Dave Eggers and inexplicably ahead of Junot Diaz.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,600
Hank, as an novelist, I really believe in the power of the precisely-chosen word.

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,160
So all I can say about this news is SMURGAPURG.

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,120
In other news, hold on, I have to change shirts, I'm feeling anxious without my collar.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,960
That's better! So, Hank, over the last few days, the Yeti and I have been on an organizational BINGE.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
And this has allowed me to come across all kinds of things I haven't seen in years,

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,820
like this Venn diagram from Brotherhood 2.0. And also much of my early work, like The Best New Years

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:42,460
Resolution Ever Happy New Year Streamers. I found misprinted EcoGeek business cards

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,880
from back in January of 2007, and I also found books that other people have written.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Like, Q and the Three Tubs of Vaseline, which really does not make sense unless you've read Paper Towns.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,220
And Debby Kitto's Pants Power and his Power Pants.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,720
I found old high school literary journals, featuring a story by me in which the main character dies,

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,480
a story by me in which the grandfather dies, and a story by me in which the main character dies.

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,640
And I found a Book About Me And My Fun Times. Here is a picture of me travelling in a space ship.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,780
It's also a picture of a man with no torso who has been imprisoned in a triangle.

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,720
I also found lots and lots of report cards. 'Incredible potential as an English student, but he has

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,040
reached a juncture where he just can't mail it in anymore.' 'It is safe to say that John underachieved this year.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,180
If he takes French 3 next year, he will need to take much greater care in his daily preparations.'

23
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,180
'John went into a tailspin in this course during the last 6 weeks.'

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:34,220
'While John has a wonderful capacity to convey empathy for people in the past, her analyzing of historical

25
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,240
writings has room for improvement.' Well, I think your pronoun use has room for improvement.

26
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,640
This is essentially what my report cards look like all the way back to, like, elementary school.

27
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,200
Then I came across this one from third grade, and I was really excited because I got all A's,

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,180
yeah, it's Hank Green's report card! Dangit!

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,700
But that's not nearly as embarrassing as my book of peaceful and amusing poems.

30
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,620
I don't know when I wrote this, Hank, but, ah, here is my biographical poem.

31
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,400
I'm gonna say that I was, like, eight, in my defence. So this is called Bio-Poem.

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:08,880
'John. Nice. Peaceful. Visionary. Joyous. Lover of peace, hope, and Jennifer.'

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,780
It must've been, ah, fourth grade, because that's when I dated Jennifer Keane. So. I guess I was older. That's. Boy.

34
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,840
I was ten! Oh, God. 'Who believed that world peace could someday be?

35
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:28,880
Who wanted good grades, high moral standards, and world peace.' -in case I have not already mentioned that-

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:35,240
'Who used his money, his love, and his writing, who gave his money, his love, and everything he had,

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,940
who said, "visualize world peace, it could happen." Green.'

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,500
I don't know why the first line of the poem is my first name and the last line of the poem is my last name,

39
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,260
but I'm worried that it's because I wanted the middle of the poem to be my nickname,

40
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:53,720
you know, like Sunny "Night Train" Liston, or Ricardo "The Bunsen" Berna?

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,140
I think I might've wanted to be known as John "Nice-Peaceful-Visionary-Joyous-Lover-Of-Peace-Hope-And

42
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,160
Jennifer-Who-Believed-That-World-Peace-Could-Someday-Be-Who-Wanted-High-Moral-Standards-

43
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,760
And-World-Peace-Who-Used-His-Money-His-Love-And-His-Writing-Who-Gave-His-Money-His-Love-And-Everything-He-Had

44
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Who-Said-Visualize-World-Peace-It-Could-Happen" Green.

45
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,560
So, Hank, the reason the Yeti and I have been going through this stuff is that I'm donating

46
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,200
all the drafts of my books, along with correspondence with my editor, Julie Strauss-Gabel

47
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,960
to the de Grummond children's library at the University of Southern Mississippi

48
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,000
which means that all the manuscripts will be archived there forever, which is awesome,

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,460
partly because it means I will be sharing a room with the manuscripts from, like, A Wrinkle in Time, Peter Rabbit...

50
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,980
They have, like, thousands of famous manuscripts, but I am greatly honored that the de Grummond Collection

51
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,440
is including my work in their library. I'm so psyched!

52
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,280
Hank, DFTBA, Nerdfighters I will see you on Fri- I did that wrong, it's Nerdfighers, DFTBA... everybody, DFTBA,

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:00:00,000
and then, Hank, I will only see you on Friday. Nerdfighters, I will see you in comments.
