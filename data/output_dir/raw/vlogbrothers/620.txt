00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
Good morning John, and sorry for this unscheduled video,

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,960
But as you know, Neil Armstrong has died, and it's super sad.

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,160
And I wax poetic all over the place in my video on SciShow,

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,860
so if you wanna see that, you can go see that.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But now, instead of talking about the symbolic nature of this great,

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,040
I just wanna talk about how Neil Armstrong was pretty freakin' badass.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,400
He did many amazing things, of course,

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
but today we're gonna talk about the 6 MOST amazing things that Neil Armstrong ever did.

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,080
#1: The first amazing cool thing that Neil Armstrong ever did

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,120
is that he got his pilot's license before he was legally allowed to get hid driver's license.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,940
Which is pretty amazing.

12
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,160
And a great way to get a leg up on the competition

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
if you wanted to become the first man on the moon,

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,300
which I'm sure was not his goal when he was 16 years old, but still!

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,760
But in addition to helping him out in getting to the moon,

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,780
it also ensured he would be the youngest person in his squadron in the Korean War,

17
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:56,800
where he flew 78 missions, one of which ended when he got hit by artillery fire

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,320
and had to fly all the way back to base and then eject because

19
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,640
there was no way for him to land the plane.

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,880
#2: While working as a test pilot for aircraft

21
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,080
Neil Armstrong flew over 200 different types of planes!

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,180
And during that particular career, he almost died around 3 times.

23
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,520
Once when he and Chuck Yeager were doing a touch-and-go landing on a salt flat that was muddy.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,080
Once when his X-15 bounced off the atmosphere, sending him 40 miles off course

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,460
with limited fuel reserves.

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,860
And once when he was landing his plane and his landing gear collapsed underneath him

27
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,240
and he had to power out of the landing, smashing the tail of his plane on the runway.

28
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,960
It destroyed the radio and released the hydraulic fluid.

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,980
*sarcastic* Yeah!

30
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,640
#3: And another time Neil Armstrong almost died!

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,860
Gemini 8, of which Neil Armstrong was
the command pilot

32
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,900
was the first mission to ever dock 2 vehicles
together in outer space.

33
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,900
And as soon as it happened,
they started spinning uncontrollably.

34
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,720
While spinning at 1 revolution a second,

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,080
(That's pretty sickeningly fast)

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,580
Armstrong aborted the mission, separated the craft, corrected the roll,

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,800
saving his and his pilot's life.

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,720
#4: Now, when they were planning on how
to build the lunar lander,

39
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,980
they had this test thing called the LLRV.

40
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,240
And it was basically just a chair strapped to a jet engine.

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,640
While test driving that thing, one of the little jets
on the side failed,

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,440
Armstrong had to try and get the thing right side up

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,100
for a moment, so he could eject, and this happened like 30 feet above the ground!

44
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,240
Before the thing hit the ground and exploded
into a giant ball of fire!

45
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,700
Later analysis showed that if he had ejected
0.5 seconds later, he would have died.

46
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,320
And that's not even the amazing part!

47
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:29,300
Neil Armstrong, after that, did a little press conference with some reporters,

48
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,980
and then went back to work.

49
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:35,200
People came by and were like "Dude, I heard that you almost just died! What are you doing here?"

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,580
And Neil was like "I had some paperwork to do."

51
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,320
#5: Neil Armstrong threatened to sue his barber.

52
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,720
Now this seems like kind of a jerk move.

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,180
Dude's been cuttin' you hair for 20 years and he gives you 1 bad haircut you threaten to sue him?!

54
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,620
But no! He threatened to sue him because the guy took some of Neil Armstrong's hair

55
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,260
and sold it to a celebrity hair collector.

56
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,100
Neil found out about it and was like "You get me my hair back or you donate that money to charity

57
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,480
or I will sue your barbershop right out from under you!"

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,940
And unable to retrieve the hair, the guy donated the $3000 to charity.

59
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,020
Good on you, Neil!

60
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
Good on you.

61
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,740
And finally, #6: Neil Armstrong walked on the freaking moon.

62
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,200
But before that, he landed the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) on the moon.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,420
In order to do that, he had to override the computer,

64
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,060
just like Luke Skywalker "I'm gonna use the force!"

65
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,940
So the computer was taking them down into a crater with big, like car-sized

66
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,900
Rocks in it and he diverted.

67
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,500
Everybody's freaking out, like "What's Neil doing!"

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,020
He gets there, lands the LEM: 30 seconds of fuel left.

69
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,680
30 seconds away

70
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,440
from our first foray into another world ending in tragedy!

71
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,460
In having 2 men, still, dead on the moon, their bodies still there.

72
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,700
Imagine the impact that would've had on our national psyche!

73
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,600
But that's not what happened.

74
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,480
Because Neil Armstrong was a freakin' badass.

75
00:03:51,480 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
