00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,960
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday!

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,360
So, recently I was talking to a producer from a cable channel that shall remain nameless and he was like:

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,720
"I love Crash Course, and you guys should make a TV show.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,640
The only thing is that if you're gonna be on television you gotta talk about stuff people enjoy, like Hitler and sex.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,460
True Story, Hank.

6
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:15,660
So, I thought I'd make a pilot for him.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,300
(tan-tan-tan-tantam) Hitler and SEX!

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,740
So, among Nazi troops Syphilis was a big problem in occupied France

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,900
and Hitler had a solution which was to send blow up sex dolls to the Army.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,660
They were smaller than life size, but they were blow up sex dolls (very aryan looking).

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:33,160
And they were designed to be able to like fold them up and put them in your backpack.

12
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,860
It probably goes without saying that the idea was eventually abandoned because the troops were like:

13
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:38,940
"Actually, we just prefer Syphilis."

14
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,740
(tan-tan-tan-tantam) Hitler and SEX!

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,160
So, there have been many rumors about Hitler's sex life over the years.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,460
Mainly, thought up by allied propaganda for the purpose of discrediting him.

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,440
Are they true?

18
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,700
Probably not, but we're gonna repeat them anyway, because this is a television show.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:58,380
The longest standing stories that Hitler was secretly gay, a case made by the 1995 book "The Pink Swastika",

20
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,100
which basically argued that all of Nazism was like an extension of the homosexual agenda.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,860
That argument is a little bit problematic. Because,

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,020
1- a 100,000 people were arrested in Nazi German for being gay.

23
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,080
2- Many of those people were killed in concentration camps. And

24
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,220
3- The prominent nazis who were actually gay, generally executed.

25
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,360
So, was Adolf Hitler secretly gay?

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,500
Let's watch 2 minutes of commercial before I say no.

27
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,980
(tan-tan-tan-tantam) Hitler and SEX!

28
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,700
So, the truth is that by most accounts Hitler was a pretty vanilla heterosexual guy.

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,780
So, why would a bunch of male heterosexual historians wanna paint him as different?

30
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,420
Your guess is as good as mine.

31
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,160
But more importantly, did Hitler have one testicle?

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,820
Let's find out! After the break.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,220
(tan-tan-tan-tantam) Hitler and SEX!

34
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,840
No, Hitler probably had two testicles, at least according to his personal physician.

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,340
But bringing this up allows me to share with you one of my favorite words in the english language:

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,640
monorchid, which means an individual with only one testicle.

37
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,120
Actual prominent monorchids include Mao Zedong,

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,960
Lance Armstrong, Hermann Göring and the drummer from Green Day.

39
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,380
(tan-tan-tan-tantam) Hitler and SEX!

40
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,780
So Hitler, this probably goes without saying, was not a very good boyfriend.

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,200
He was controlling, and possessive, and domineering.

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,220
He was basically all the hallmarks of the abusive relationship.

43
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,180
And in fact of the six women that Hitler most likely had sex with, four of them committed suicide.

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,860
They included his half-niece Geli, the British woman Unity Mitford, Renate Müller and

45
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,520
of course Hitler's long time lover, Eva Braun,

46
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
whom he married just 40 hours before they comitted suicide together.

47
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,480
Of the two remaining most likely lovers,

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,400
one, Marie Reiter attempted to kill herself in the midst of a break-up with Hitler;

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,660
and the other, Erna Hanfstaengl tried to kill Hitler, or at least overthrow him in 1943.

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,460
So, yes, dating Hitler was clearly not the key to happiness.

51
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,920
(tan-tan-tan-tantam) Hitler and SEX!

52
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,420
Well, yes, I did say half-niece earlier.

53
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,300
Hitler's half-niece lived with him for two years, during which time he grew increasingly possessive and crazy.

54
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,180
He forced her to cut off all contact with her friends, and she eventually comitted suicide.

55
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,920
I wish that story was unique.

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,620
But the truth is, domestic abuse is disgustingly common

57
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:57,560
and this is yet another example of Hitler being tragically unextraordinary.

58
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,580
Hank, a real accurate television show about Hitler and sex would be boring and sad.

59
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,460
Because Hitler's sex life was boring

60
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:09,320
and the awful way he treated the women he loved was not unique or even rare.

61
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,860
All the essentializing and sensationalizing of these stories is designed to make us feel comfortable,

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,380
to make us feel like we aren't like those people.

63
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,120
We wanna feel fundamentally different from the people who participate in genocide.

64
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,100
But, of course, that's not the truth, Hank.

65
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,940
The truth, whether TV executives want to accept it or not, resists simplicity.

66
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,320
I think I'll stick with Youtube.

67
00:03:29,320 --> 00:00:00,000
Hank I'll see you on friday.
