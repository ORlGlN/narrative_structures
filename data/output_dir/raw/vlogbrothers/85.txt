1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,360
Good morning, John!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,040
So, the United States is pulling out of the Paris Climate...

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:04,680
Agreement...

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,280
Treaty...

5
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:05,780
A - Accord?

6
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:06,660
Protocol?

7
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,800
The - I don't -

8
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,960
Let's be honest - There's a really good chance that you have a strong opinion on the Paris agreement,

9
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,960
... And an EVEN BETTER chance you don't really know what it is.

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,400
There are too many things to know, so quick timeline...

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,400
350 million years ago

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,680
Ancient plants covered the earth, converting the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) in the air into Oxygen(O2)

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,080
and carbohydrates.

14
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,720
These plants then die, and they create massive mats of organic materials that get buried.

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,119
Those organic materials then hang around under the earth getting heated up and smushed and form

16
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,180
energy-dense hydrocarbons, also called "fossil fuels".

17
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,660
Notice how cardohydrate and hydrocarbon sound similar.

18
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,640
1882

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,240
There was a big gap there.

20
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,900
Thomas Edison builds the first centralized coal-fired powerplant.

21
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,920
We've been using coal for a long time before that

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,340
of course but I'm starting here because we have to start somewhere.

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,340
For the next 100 years, fossil fuels brought tremendous growth and

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,660
increases in quality life, specifically in Europe and America,

25
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,300
where the vast majority of fossil fuels were burned.

26
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,380
Decades pass. The benefits of fossil fuels eventually begin to spread

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,780
and everyone is consuming more and more.

28
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,640
It's great, for the most part, except that all that CO2 that was locked up in fossil fuels for

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,000
billions of years is now being re-released

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,020
and CO2 is really good at letting visible light pass through it

31
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,040
but infrared radiation that gets bounced

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,160
back up by the earth does not pass right through it.

33
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
It gets trapped.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,880
So the earth's atmosphere and oceans start having more energy in them

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,460
and that starts to change the climate.

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,160
And while fossil fuels give us remarkable abilities to do cool and beautiful things

37
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,500
and increase the quality of life

38
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,880
here on earth, we also

39
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,160
rely on a stable climate, for massive farming operations

40
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,140
and coastal infrastructure (by which

41
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,500
I mean all of the cities that people live in.)

42
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,920
Jumping forward again

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,500
to 2015, 270 countries get

44
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,080
together in Paris with a goal:

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,500
We want to keep the average warming of the earth below

46
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
2 degrees Celcius because, if we don't, it's

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
gonna be really bad for everyone.

48
00:01:54,500 --> 00:02:00,880
But the problem is no one country can handle this because even the biggest contributors, the U.S. and China, together make up less than

49
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
half of the pie. Everyone needs to

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,380
agree to make changes or no one benefits.

51
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,380
Worse, the poor countries

52
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
that have admitted basically zero greenhouse gases

53
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,060
are going to be the ones that are most negatively affected by this CO2

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,060
that's been released by the wealthy countries

55
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,060
because they have more food and water insecurity,

56
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,640
less access to good medicine, and less infrastructure.

57
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
It's very difficult to say to them,

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,600
No! Don't grow your economy using the same dirty fuels and techniques

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,820
that we used to grow our economies.

60
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,020
Instead! Buy these solar panels from us! With the money you don't have!

61
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,420
Also, like, since any country that keeps burning its usual will have

62
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,820
a competitive advantage in industry, everyone agrees that everyone needs to agree,

63
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
or this agreement is useless.

64
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,020
With advice from scientists, the countries all together determined

65
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,340
how quickly the Earth needs to stop emitting greenhouse gases

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,340
to meet the 2 degree goal.

67
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,420
And then, based on how developed each country is, how many people they have,

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,620
and how much they're currently emitting, they divvied up that responsibility.

69
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,940
At the end, every country had a goal.

70
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,440
There was no enforcement for meeting that goal, but there was a goal.

71
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,960
And, some countries that had already benefitted a lot from the last hundred years

72
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,600
of releasing carbon dioxide even threw in some money:

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,840
billions of dollars to aid countries that hadn't benefitted from that,

74
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,520
to help them grow with less reliance on fossil fuels.

75
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,740
Every country agreed to their own path forward, and every country was responsible

76
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,740
for figuring out how to meet their goals,

77
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,740
whether it's through energy efficiency,

78
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,100
subsidizing renewables, regulating businesses,

79
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
changing people's behavior through education, or

80
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,100
ending fossil fuel subsidies.

81
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,100
And if countries don't meet their target?

82
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
Again, nothing happens.

83
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,720
There are no penalties.

84
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,720
This is an agreement between nations that there is a problem,

85
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
and we must lead together, or

86
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
face the price. And, remarkably,

87
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
A treaty that only encourages countries to reduce

88
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
emissions with unenforceable promises is

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
a gigantic step, and one that has

90
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,720
already seen significant success.

91
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
But this is an investment, and it does

92
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,720
have costs. Do we know

93
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,720
exactly what that price will be?

94
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,720
No. We don't know precisely

95
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,860
how much better off we'll be if we keep temperatures

96
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,860
from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius, and

97
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,860
we don't know precisely how much we need to reduce

98
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,860
greenhouse gas emissions to hit that target.

99
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
But we do know that we are better off

100
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
incentivizing these changes now, globally,

101
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
because more than 600 million people

102
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
live in areas threatened by sea level rise.

103
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Every person on Earth has

104
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,860
to eat every single day,

105
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
and climate refugees' lost crops

106
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,860
and lost infrastructure could destabilize

107
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
the entire world economy and result in

108
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,400
a very bad era of human history,

109
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
a sentiment to which the U.S. Department of

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,520
Defense, by the way, agrees. Remarkably,

111
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,520
thanks to a combination of energy efficiency,

112
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,520
changing habits, and a shift from coal to

113
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
natural gas and renewables, the United States

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,520
was, until recently, on target

115
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,520
to meet its Paris goals for decreasing

116
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,520
emissions 26% from 2005

117
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
levels by 2025.

118
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,520
We've already decreased emissions by around 14%,

119
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,520
even as the economy has grown.

120
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,520
But if there is no political will to continue

121
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
this, if the majority party in both houses

122
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
of Congress and the president do not

123
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,520
agree that humans are causing climate change

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,520
and want to continue investing in the same energy

125
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
systems Thomas Edison pioneered

126
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,520
in the 1800s, we will stall.

127
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Other countries, at the moment, are pledging

128
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
to move forward, leading in the absence

129
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,520
of the United states. And, several states

130
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,520
in the U.S., the ones with the largest economies,

131
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
also have plans to abide by the

132
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,520
agreement. But without the U.S.,

133
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,520
a country that emits 18% of the world's

134
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,520
greenhouse gases with just 4% of the

135
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,520
population, this pioneering agreement

136
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,520
is considerably weakened.

137
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,520
After all, why would other countries hold

138
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,520
up their side of the bargain if the country

139
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,520
that benefitted the most from the Carbon Dioxide

140
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,520
currently in the atmosphere shirks

141
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,980
their responsibility? I, for one,

142
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
am tired of politicians pretending that

143
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
we don't all share

144
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
this big, beautiful, but also quite small

145
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,240
planet. I was proud that

146
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,040
my country was a leader in establishing the Paris agreement,

147
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,040
and I am ashamed at the step backward

148
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,720
we have taken away from uniting humanity

149
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,060
to take on this great global challenge.

150
00:05:51,060 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
