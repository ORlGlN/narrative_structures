00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,740
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:01,740
It may have come to your attention

3
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,980
that I do too many things.

4
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:05,440
And I've been asked, "How do you do it?"

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,940
And I gotta say: I'm not sure I do.

6
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,100
I haven't had good answers to that question because I haven't ever really spent a lot of time thinking about it

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,740
and also like I don't know that I'm super healthy about it

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,540
I wouldn't necessarily give people my secrets cause I think a lot of them

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,260
aren't good for me.

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,120
Let's just say that there is an unpleasantly long list there, right th- it's looking at me

11
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,260
and I, ugh.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,580
I love all the things and I want to do them all and I will

13
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,240
it's just, it's a long list.

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,720
Like right now, we're already working on Project for Awesome 2017

15
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,200
which is gonna happen right after Podcon

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,160
which is a thing we just finished a crowdfunding campaign for and

17
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,520
now have put normal tickets on sale for, if you're interested in Podcasts, if you like those.

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,860
I'm working on my creator track keynote for Vidcon. I'm trying to relearn how to play my

19
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:49,260
own music, cause I'm doing a solo set this year for the first time in a long time.

20
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,360
And I'm also prepping for Vidcon Australia, which is coming up very fast.

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,380
I'm trying to help build a guild of internet creators, so we can support each other and like have a voice together.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,320
That's intense!

23
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,640
And I just got a cheap'o microscope and I've been pointing it at everything

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,379
This morning I brought in some leaves from my cherry tree, which is

25
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:07,920
currently infested with aphids, to look with the microscope.

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,320
And if you don't like bug-things, like tiny- lots of tiny bugs

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,980
you want to skip to THIS time code

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,360
because we're going to look at those right now.

29
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,980
All at the same time on this tree right now

30
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,480
we have every stage of ladybugs

31
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,220
We've got the eggs

32
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,600
We've got the eggs hatching with the tiny, tiny little larvae coming out

33
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,680
We've got the much bigger larvae because they get bigger and bigger as they eat more aphids

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,140
and I saw one adult seven-spotted ladybug and put it on the microscope

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,800
and it friggin' ate aphids while I was staring at it

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
and... it was SO COOL

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,920
And I'm very glad that I get to share it with you.

38
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,220
Also other things are happening!

39
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,820
Like Nathan Zed just launched his merch on DFTBA.com which is partially based on a video he made here on Vlogbrothers.

40
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:47,800
And it sold out, in like five minutes. It's very good! We should have printed more shirts, and I feel bad!

41
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,460
Anyway, I've been thinking all of this stuff, about productivity and doing too many things a lot lately.

42
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:58,760
And so here are two unhealthy secrets to my productivity and three healthy ones.

43
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,580
First, the unhealthy ones.

44
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,200
Uh, number one. I have convinced myself that if I am not using all the tools I have at my disposal

45
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,600
to do the maximum amount of good and like give people good jobs,

46
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,860
then I am less of a good person than I otherwise could be.

47
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,400
And that's maybe a little bit too much pressure.

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,440
Maybe not. But maybe.

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,880
And the second one: I intentionally put myself in situations

50
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,640
where people who I care about and who I respect rely on me to do things,

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,860
which is very motivating! But also very stressful.

52
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,660
Now for the healthy ones! One: I don't get caught up  in doing anything perfectly.

53
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,560
I'm not here for the idea of the idea. I just want to try stuff! And if it explodes... it exploded!

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,220
And like, I learned!

55
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,540
Two: I love giving other people responsibility. I love putting them in difficult situations and saying

56
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,280
"Figure this out; help me do this."

57
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,820
And if they do it wrong or they do it differently from how I would have done it, I don't get mad as long as they're learning.

58
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:57,760
Because there is no way to get good at stuff, except to do it and fail and learn.

59
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,500
And finally number three, and this is, I think, for everybody,

60
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,980
and this is way bigger and broader than just productivity:

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,060
I follow and cultivate my own curiosity.

62
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,320
I think curiosity is one of the top two or three human characteristics.

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,180
It's something that I really like about myself and something that I don't mind liking about myself.

64
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,180
I wanna understand stuff! I wanna understand people!

65
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:28,740
Following my curiosity so frequently leads me to better life decisions and better business decisions, but also just feeling better.

66
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,980
You're never gonna feel bad about your whole life if you, like, loved people and you were curious.

67
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,800
I mean, that's kind of all I want.

68
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:44,380
I'm gonna get like 70-90 years, fingers crossed. That's all I want. I want to do that. For 70-90 years.

69
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,080
John, I'll see you on Tuesday.
