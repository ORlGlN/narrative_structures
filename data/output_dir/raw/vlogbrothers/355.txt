1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,070
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,469
I've been writing all morning so I'm just
kinda out of it.

3
00:00:03,469 --> 00:00:06,270
I've been writing almost every day since I
got back from the Paper Towns set, and as

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,419
much as I do enjoy spending 18 hours a day,
six days a week trying to figure out precisely

5
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:14,200
what an Executive Producer is supposed to
do, I definitely like writing even more.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,330
Like, it's just such a massive relief to even
temporarily feel like you can escape the prison

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,869
of your consciousness, you know?

8
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,140
But I'm just kind of out of it 'cause I'm
kind of in the story and not really here.

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:24,690
But anyway, today's video comes to you in
two parts:

10
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,690
Part one.

11
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,690
A Decade.

12
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,740
Hank, it has been ten years since my first
novel Looking for Alaska was published.

13
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,770
As nerdfighter Temerity Jane pointed out on
Twitter that means that Looking for Alaska

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:35,460
is now like a fifth grader.

15
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,320
Looking For Alaska isn't just potty trained
it can like make itself a grilled cheese for

16
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,870
lunch and read books.

17
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,320
Looking For Alaska potentially could read
Looking for Alaska, although I would not recommend

18
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
it.

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,940
By the way, Hank, you might know nerdfighter
Temerity Jane as the person whose marriage

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:51,160
proposal I participated in many years ago?

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,100
John: Will you marry him?

22
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,930
Kelly: Holy...

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,930
Yes!

24
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,670
John: YEAH!

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,420
SHE SAID YES!

26
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,420
HUZZAH!

27
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,177
Kelly: Oh my god, I don't even have pants
on.

28
00:01:03,177 --> 00:01:04,177
John: GAHHH!

29
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,180
Well, Hank, not only are she and nerdfighter
Phil now married, they in fact have a child.

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,799
A tiny little nerdfighter.

31
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,799
God, we're getting old.

32
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,600
But I just feel so incredibly lucky and grateful
that this little book has hung around for

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,600
so long.

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,009
And as of today, Hank, there is a brand new
super fancy edition of Looking for Alaska

35
00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:22,100
with fifty pages of bonus content and really,
really nice paper.

36
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,750
Hank, as you know, I'm something of a book
making nerd, and nothing against the original

37
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,950
Looking for Alaska with the candle cover that
I didn't like because this is cigarette smoke

38
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,759
not candle smoke, and its cheap paper and
its inexpensive binding.

39
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,490
But Hank, I always dreamed that when I had
a book come out it would have this thing.

40
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,620
You see that thinG up there?

41
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,730
That black and white thing?

42
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:43,710
That little thing is astonishingly expensive,
but it is my favorite thing in books.

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,200
Also it's got this beautiful cover designed
by Rodrigo Corral and these great end papers

44
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
he designed.

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,939
At the beginning it says "I go to seek a great
perhaps," which were the last words of François

46
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,871
Rabelais, and at the end it says "How will
I ever get out of this labyrinth?" which were

47
00:01:55,871 --> 00:01:57,100
the last words of Simón Bolívar.

48
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,770
It's also got a new introduction from me,
a bunch of deleted and revised scenes from

49
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,939
the book to give people a sense of how Julie
and I worked on it together, a retrospective

50
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:09,080
essay by the great YA lit scholar Michael
Cart, and like thirty pages of me answering

51
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,730
the questions that readers have asked me most
over the years.

52
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,200
But mostly it's just like the physical object
of my dreams.

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,730
So yeah, this is in bookstores now, but mostly
ten years later I just wanted to say thank

54
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,730
you.

55
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,730
Part two.

56
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,730
The 2014 Project for Awesome.

57
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,280
So Hank, this year, half the Project for Awesome
raised money for Save the Children and Partners

58
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
in Health.

59
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,220
That part raised over $700,000 for those two
great organizations.

60
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,670
And then the second part of the Project for
Awesome raised money for charities chosen

61
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,670
by nerdfighteria.

62
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,840
And today I get to announce what those charities
are.

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,400
The top ten charities according to your votes
at projectforawesome.com will receive $25,000

64
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,170
each, and they are:

65
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,500
Not Forgotten, which works with orphans in
Peru.

66
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,260
The Harry Potter Alliance, which works to
decrease world-suck in all kinds of ways around

67
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,260
the world.

68
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,970
The Office of Letters and Light, which runs
NaNoWriMo.

69
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,990
The Thirst Project, a water charity.

70
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,420
This Star Won't Go Out, which provides direct
support to families of kids living with cancer.

71
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,610
Doctors Without Borders, which provides, you
know, doctors without borders.

72
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,030
Days for Girls International, which works
to provide feminine hygiene products and sexual

73
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,800
education to girls around the world.

74
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,430
She's the First, which is dedicated to girls'
education in the developing world.

75
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,080
Pencils for Kids, which, you know, brings
pencils to kids.

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,190
And
Ultimate Peace, an organization that uses

77
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,031
Ultimate Frisbee to facilitate relationships
between Israelis and Palestinians.

78
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,170
Smaller grants, but still over $10,000 will
go to the next ten charities chosen by nerdfighteria

79
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,170
which are:

80
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,580
We Need Diverse Books
The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention

81
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,130
The Book Truck
To Write Love on Her Arms

82
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,090
Donate Life
Garczyńska's Foundation

83
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,970
Books for Africa
Stella's Circle

84
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,200
Water.org and
The Sound of Hope.

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,030
These twenty charities are going to use our
money to decrease worldsuck in lots of ways.

86
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,930
It's just awesome.

87
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,930
Thank you.

88
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,680
OK now I'm going to go back to writing, Hank,
because I miss it.

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,810
By the way, Hank, I hear on Tumblr that you
are also writing a story.

90
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:45,050
This is how I find out about things in my
brother's life now.

91
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,050
Tumblr.

92
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,630
But seriously, Hank, can you believe it's
been ten years?

93
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,830
I mean, this book is older than YouTube!

94
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,790
It's older than some of the people watching
this video.

95
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,790
Ah!

96
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,040
That didn't go particularly well.

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:00:00,000
I'll see you on Friday.
