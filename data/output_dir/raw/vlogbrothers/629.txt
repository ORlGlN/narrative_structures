00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,340
GOOD MORNING, JOHN!

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,380
Happy Esther Day, John.

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,800
I love you. Sometimes I don't understand life.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,700
And sometimes I don't understand my life, particularly.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,740
Like the part where the Olympic gymnast/nerdfighter signed to millions of people,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,020
or the part where kimya Dawson purchased a nerdfighter shirt.

7
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,240
For me, actually without me even knowing, I would have given it to her.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,700
Or the part where I dove off of the stage into a crowd of people.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,880
(Hank)I don't understand my life, Kimya.
(Kimya)I don't understand mine either!

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,500
Probably, that's a pretty universal thing.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,200
I don't think that we really understand our lives very well.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,760
John, when I watched your last video, the top comment had 93 thumbs up.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,700
And this is what it said: "while watching gymnastics with my mom all I could think was 'What am I doing with my life?

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,660
These girls are just about the same age as me, and they are doing something with their lives.

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:52,840
They're in the freaking Olympics.' and that feeling sucks."

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,040
But here is the thing, gymnastics scoring, or even the appreciation of gymnastics isn't a universal thing.

17
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,960
The Olympics has value because we come together as individuals and give it value.

18
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,840
Like, if shot put weren't a thing, and people weren't watching, and didn't give it value,

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,660
it would just be a guy out in a field with a rock.

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,420
Guys, I'm gonna throw this rock really far.

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,240
He throws the rock! I threw the rock further than anybody ever thrown the rock, Wee!

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,460
He would just be a crazy person. When people say "I'm not doing anything with my life".

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,940
What I hear is "I'm not doing anything of value with my life".

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,280
But when I think of the value that I appreciate, and the value that I create,

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,020
Even though I'm a guy who is literally and figuratively on a stage pretty often.

26
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:37,940
What matters to me most is how much I love people and how much the people that I love, love me.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:42,060
And here's the shocker. Jennnifer Pinches, nerdfighter gymnastic extraordinaire,

28
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,360
and Kyla Ross  and McKayla Maroney, those people, they wanna compete, they wanna get gold.

29
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,340
They wanna be in the Olympics, they wanna test themselves, they wanna beat their best.

30
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,460
But most of all, they want the exact same thing as all of us, which is to be loved by the people that they love.

31
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,560
That's number one, and I know that's number one for them because they're people,

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,620
and it's number one for all people. And that's why this week, when I read that comment,

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,300
Esther's message hit home harder than ever.

34
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,240
And if you don't know anything about this,

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Esther Earl was a Nerdfighter who we met back in 2009, at the first LeakyCon.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,040
She and her friends had been, and continue to be, very important to the project of nerdfighteria.

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,440
And at that point Esther had been living with cancer for a long time.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,980
When Esther was really sick, John told her that we wanted to celebrate her birthday every year,

39
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,160
for as long as the Vlogbrothers channel existed.

40
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,980
And he wanted to know how she wanted us to celebrate it.

41
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,280
And she took her time telling us. It took like two weeks since she finally got back to us.

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,260
And she told John that she wanted it to be a day where we celebrated love between family members and friends.

43
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,480
Not like Valentine's day, where we celebrate romantic love,

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
but a time where we'd go out and make an effort

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,440
to say I love you to the people who we're maybe a little bit uncomfortable saying "I love you" to.

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,060
To the 93 people that upvoted that comment and to everybody else who feels this way,

47
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:03,820
remember that the value that you bring to the world largely comes with what you love and who loves you.

48
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,500
And not an Olympic sport, but this Esther day today,

49
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,800
you get a gold medal in love if you can say "I love you" to some people who you don't usually say it to.

50
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,400
Don't take other people's love for granted and don't assume that they know how you feel.

51
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,160
If you need a little bit of help with that, Nerdfighter Joviana made some amazing Esthertines.

52
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,940
They're Nerdfighter-themed but, you know, they work for anybody.

53
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,600
Best delivered by hand, with a note on the back telling people why you love them.

54
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm gonna go give Katherine hers right now.

55
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,200
Thank you to Nerdfighteria for spreading these ideas, for making the world suck less,

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,140
for making the world more awesome, and for making the world a little bit weirder.

57
00:03:37,140 --> 00:00:00,000
John, I'll see you on tuesday.
