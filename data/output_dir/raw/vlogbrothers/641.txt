00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Good morning, John.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:04,200
He sent me out...to buy cookies.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,840
And as I left, I saw him press his ear to the ground so that he could hear me,

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,400
So that he would know,

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,700
He would know every step I took,

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,200
and not just that, but every step,

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,820
everyone on the world was taking.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,380
Last night, I had a dream - not that dream.

9
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,360
The dream was "Here's a good idea for a vlogbrothers video:

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:29,660
There's a guy who can put his ear to the ground and hear everybody,

11
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,700
including you on your way to get cookies at the grocery store."

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,500
*hank noises*

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,140
This is my stress-relieving, right here, just

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,820
makin' the ticky tacky stretch!

15
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,760
I've noticed that not-

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,320
Most people don't call this "ticky tacky."

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,900
I'm not sure what ticky tacky is, let me check.

18
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,700
"Sleazy or shoddy material used especially in the construction of lookalike tract homes."

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,200
So wow, that's very specific.

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,160
And now I have read the entire wikipedia page...on Blu Tack.

21
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:55,560
This stuff was created accidentaly, like many of science's greatest accomplishments.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,320
Completely by accident!

23
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,800
Just like, uh, NutraSweet?

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,080
Which is a fantastic scientific accomplishment

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,040
because it has done so much to...

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:03,560
(stutters)

27
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,400
...decrease America's weight!

28
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,800
I mean look at this graph of the use of NutraSweet

29
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,300
and the weight of Ameri-

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,440
Wait.

31
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,620
Wha- How did that happen!?

32
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,400
WhAt'S uP wItH tHaT!?!?

33
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,480
I'm fine. I'm fine!

34
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,580
We actually just did a SciShow episode on the increasing weight of Americans,

35
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,700
and it turns out that if the entire world were the same size as North Americans,

36
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,220
that would be the equivalent of almost a billion new people.

37
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:26,880
Wow.

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,980
So what's all this stuff that's going on?

39
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,540
I don't want to talk to much about VidCon

40
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,020
because the tickets aren't on sale anymore and you're just gonna be sad.

41
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,420
But that's the biggest *frustrated noises* on my head right now, lots going on there.

42
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,880
There's stuff on my lens...

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,900
*lens cleaning noises*

44
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,560
This shirt was given to me by Ningmaster Tom.

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,500
Up Up Down Down

46
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,960
Strange Charm Strange Charm

47
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
Top Bottom Quark

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,400
heheheheh

49
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,220
I like it when you mix videogames and some other nerdy thing together.

50
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,660
I also have that Art History videogame nerd shirt.

51
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,840
Ehrm, you mean this one?

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
YETI:
YEEAA I MEAN THAT ONE!

53
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,700
Additionally,

54
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,340
Additionally

55
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,960
Additionally?

56
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,560
Additionally!

57
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,420
∀DDI⊥IOᴎ∀⅂⅂⅄

58
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,700
Adishonull..l..ll....

59
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,380
*grunt*

60
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,340
I got a new miniature tripod.

61
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,460
It's really small.

62
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,420
It came...for free with my new *large* tripod,

63
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,420
which is from Ravelli,

64
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,260
and they didn't pay me to say that!

65
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,180
'Cause no one ever pays me to say anything, people!

66
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,520
You wanna pay me to say something?

67
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,420
That'd be an interesting...business model.

68
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,680
You just like... Give me five dollars and I'll say anything you want in a vlogbrothers video.

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,480
Fart fart fart

70
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,820
Farewell to the admiralty of Dan...

71
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,240
And if you give me ten,

72
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,500
I'll put on my French moustache while I'm saying it.

73
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,920
I like how it's a "French Moustache,"

74
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,600
and then underneath that it says

75
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,160
"Moustache de Francais"

76
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,500
*le hank noises*

77
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,580
Who wants a moustache?

78
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,480
That good?

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,820
I think that's its permanent home.

80
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,900
That one's the best.

81
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,760
*chuckles*

82
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,380
That's awesome.

83
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,200
Lizzie Bennet.

84
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,740
It's really interesting to me that it has a very, like,

85
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:46,640
exactly the same number of views every episode, which is really rare for a web series.

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,400
Every episode, same number, like, 70,000 views per episode, which is amazing,

87
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,160
but it's, like, 30,000 views under us being able to pay for the show *laughs*

88
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,260
I don't know why I get too specific here.

89
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:04,640
So if 30,000 of you, you know, just 30,000, wanna go and watch all of them, that'd be great!

90
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm getting some new business cards for VidCon.

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,820
Boop! There it is!

92
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,600
I do have one more vlogbrothers video to do before VidCon,

93
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,340
and I'll be in LA, and I don't know what I'm going to do.

94
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,680
Cuz this one's crazy, so I can't do crazy twice in a row, can I!?

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,020
It would be...double crazy...

96
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,560
...crazy times two...

97
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,060
...I've never done this with my voice before...

98
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,360
...It's not going well.

99
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
Okay, the battery light is blinking, I've already filled up a whole card,

100
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,120
This is going to be a pain to edit, I don't really know what happened this video, it's been weird...

101
00:03:33,120 --> 00:00:00,000
So John, I'll see you on Monday.
