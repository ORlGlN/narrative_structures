15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,340

taking health oral comm which is like a

17
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:43,950
speech class and consumer ed and it's

18
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,300
not because I like failed any of my

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,739
classes I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get ahead for</font>

20
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,270
next year because there are the required

21
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,430
classes so I just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do them over</font>

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,989
the summer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't have to worry</font>

23
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,199
about them during school year um so
