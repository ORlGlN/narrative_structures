00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,590
switched it out to this one because the

79
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">other one was kind of a weird sighs it</font>

80
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,239
was too big to put in the upper

81
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,150
compartments like on an airplane but it

82
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,400
was like it wasn't like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big that</font>

83
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you could put it like fit a lot of stuff</font>

84
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,400
in it if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to like put it</font>

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,370
under baggage or whatever so my mom

86
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,660
actually found this one which was also

87
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,329
on fifty percent off and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot</font>

88
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,780
bigger this one has like wheels and it's

89
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,600
like kind of a full-on suitcase<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

90
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't know but it has two pockets in</font>

91
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,410
the front it looks basically the same

92
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,720
it's hot pink on the inside but it's a

93
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,600
lot bigger so I like that a lot and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

homework that I didn't finish yet

99
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,860
