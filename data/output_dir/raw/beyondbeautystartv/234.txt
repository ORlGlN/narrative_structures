00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,810
to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me uh-huh so I ended up not</font>

91
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,870
vlogging as much as I thought I would um

92
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,919
but first off like the lighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just</font>

93
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,780
horrible I mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys just</font>

94
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,060
saw how bad the lighting was like the

95
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,550
haunted<font color="#CCCCCC"> house is like all my footage was</font>

96
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,160
just black<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in</font>

97
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,550
some like decently interesting moments

98
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,840
where you can hear our voices like

99
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,310
screaming or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't really</font>

100
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,560
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but i also got yelled at a bunch of</font>

101
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">times to put my camera away because</font>

102
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're like not supposed to have video</font>

103
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,810
cameras or like anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

104
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:39,930
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really get to like</font>

105
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,889
vlog at all during that but yeah and

106
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">then also um I feel like every single</font>

107
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,050
time I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vlog my friends it just</font>

108
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,180
fails miserably and it just never turns

109
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,430
out successfully like you know you have

110
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,080
those times with your friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> when if</font>

111
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,150
you just like you're like<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on a</font>

112
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,039
good joke and you're just like creating

113
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,139
this awesome memory of just like a funny

114
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,660
moment and then you just like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you forget</font>

115
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,250
to pull out your<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera and then when</font>

116
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,410
you do pull your camera it's just like

117
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,240
no one has anything to say so it's just

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,500
like this is awkward so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always pull my</font>

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,229
camera out like right after like we have

120
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,410
some funny joke going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that is like</font>

121
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:21,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">semi interesting to vlog about so that</font>

122
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,400
sucks because then my vlogs just end up

123
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,840
being pretty boring and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are</font>

124
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:28,320
probably like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care um so</font>

125
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,020
yeah i i'm i'm getting slightly better

126
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,500
was blogging with my friends I just just

127
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,270
got to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the swing of whipping</font>

128
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,860
out the camera during those funny

129
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,020
moments because I always forget but it

130
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,580
also it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really hard to film with</font>

131
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,940
my friends because our humor is just so

132
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,370
like either someone says someone else's

133
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,970
last name or says in a bad word or if

134
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,039
they see something perverted or I don't

135
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">know um yeah that is it for today's</font>

136
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,180
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope you guys enjoyed it I know</font>

138
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,179
