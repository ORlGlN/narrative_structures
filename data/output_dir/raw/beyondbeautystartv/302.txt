32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,049
quality is really good on this camera so

33
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,009
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys don't how much it costed um the</font>

34
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:27,720
first store that we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw this</font>

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,060
camera um it was like four hundred and

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">fifty dollars or something and it was</font>

37
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">very expensive my dad's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

38
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,119
know let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere else and check</font>

39
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,799
out on their camera sound like okay and

40
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,070
so we went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this other place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

41
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,509
had the same set camera they were

42
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,590
selling it for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 150 dollars cheaper so it</font>

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,880
was about like three hundred dollars

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,149
which was um a really good deal because

45
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,140
it was like on sale and um the reason

46
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,149
that we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get my video camera</font>

47
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,310
camera fixed was because it costs two

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,810
hundred dollars to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed so my dad</font>

49
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,490
was like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth it you might as</font>
