00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,030
of making more videos which is you know

22
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,399
really awesome also if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you notice that</font>

23
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,260
I'm wearing the same shirt in the same

24
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,500
hair and same wake up as my newest video

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,530
on my main channel which is my luxy hair

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,079
extensions review that's because I'm

27
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,840
just recorded that video so that's why

28
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,309
I'm wearing the same exact outfit and

29
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,650
stuff like that I'll suggest notice I

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,229
made my bed in my video that like never

31
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:09,479

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,540
butt to do it because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it took like 10</font>

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,670
minutes but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it was worth it</font>

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,229
because it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my room is clean</font>

37
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,409
even though the bottom underneath me has
