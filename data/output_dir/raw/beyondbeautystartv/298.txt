44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,040
wish list video and Christmas haul and

45
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,490
all that stuff but honestly um I'm

46
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,780
actually not getting anything for

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,980
Christmas because I've already gotten

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,900
everything that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get for</font>

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,230

this little tumblr so I'm not getting

53
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,910
anything more nothing else so that's why

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,340
I didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a Christmas video</font>

55
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,090
um but super exciting news I think we

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,140
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going to Hawaii for Christmas</font>

57
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,880

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,670
going to kawaii with this other family

59
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,920

61
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:02,340
thought right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're just looking at</font>

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,790
hotels and stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font>

63
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,350

00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,959

65
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,440
super super exciting and um of course

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,799

83
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,510
have to say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I realized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

84
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:10,720
lot and I'm not kidding guys a lot of

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">girls got kicked out or banned from</font>

86
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,660
Maybach TV and you know their messaging

87
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,220
me like why did you kick me how all I

88
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,200
asked was like like how old are you or

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,740
something something random and a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

90
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,980
girls got kicked out and I honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

91
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,830
no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i myself only kicked out</font>

92
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,310
I think about four<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and they were</font>

93
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,890
like random people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were saying you</font>

94
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,290
know inappropriate things and everyone

95
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,090
was hanging<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to band out this</font>

96
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,430
person they keep saying bad things so I

97
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">only band out like four people and I</font>

98
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,940
don't know why so many girls that kicked

99
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,520
off um i tooted about it and a wonder

100
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,820
girl said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you type a lot than</font>

101
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,650
they ought sometimes you will

102
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,540
automatically get kicked out so that

103
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,020
could have been it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and um I wasn't smart</font>

104
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,880
enough to check if someone else was

105
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,610
operating because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

106
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,260
other operators I think there are other

107
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:10,200
operators that were kicking people out I

108
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,530
think and um I'm so sorry for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the girls</font>

109
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,800
that got kicked out definitely um I have

110
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,840
no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not do that some people</font>

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,070
said that they're going on subscribe

112
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,350
does that happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry I'm</font>
