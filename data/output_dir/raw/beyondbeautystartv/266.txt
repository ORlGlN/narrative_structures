my part it's like it's like a metal part

24
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,979
like an uneven middle part<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't know</font>

I'm just swearing light lips and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

28
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,659
peachy blush and that also i'm wearing

29
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,939
kind of a very smoky like topi brown

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,159
kind of eyeshadow look I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really liking</font>

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:31,040
it lately I've been wearing it a lot and

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,560
once again get over here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of</font>

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
whatever oh I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys what</font>

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,960
should i do my hair like I have an idea

35
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,590
ok so my roots are like starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow</font>

36
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,600
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it looks really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad in the back</font>

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,210
oh we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look so bad so I want</font>

38
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys opinion should i highlight my</font>

39
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,750
hair again so that um you know my roots

40
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,340
aren't as bad and then my hair is just

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,110
going to be a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit lighter because</font>

42
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">i notice it whatever i highlight my hair</font>

43
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,030
it fades a lot like the day that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

44
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">highlighted it it will be like bleach</font>

45
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:05,909
blonde and then I'll kind of fade which

46
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:09,229
I like that I like hot fades so um

47
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,819
should I either get blonde highlights

48
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:13,739
again I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do it at home it'll</font>

49
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:15,120
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like for a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but they'll you</font>

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna look all my hair</font>

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,319
always looks or I was thinking should I

52
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,620
get brown highlights everywhere so that

53
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,989
kind of for the colder season I'm going

54
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,400
to have a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit darker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hair and</font>

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,620
also the reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was thinking of</font>

56
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,870
doing that is because then I won't have

57
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,670
to do my roots as much because if the

58
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,550
highlights like more of the brown

59
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,379
highlights kind of matched my roots it

60
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,390
will be easier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to get away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

61
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">not touching up my roots for a long time</font>

62
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,400
do you guys something because I'll do

63
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,050
highlights that kind of match my natural

64
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,959
hair so thinking that those those are

65
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,120
the two options<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should i go for</font>

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">ombre ombre however you say it where</font>

67
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,590
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> laying on the bottom and then dark</font>

68
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,050
at the top and if I did that then I

69
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:03,060
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably like lighten some hair</font>

70
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,540
down here like<font color="#E5E5E5"> only not all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it</font>

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,250
because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it too dramatic but</font>

72
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,000
like imagine highlights on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom</font>

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,980
like that I could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that easily at home</font>

74
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,560
and then I'd probably just let my roots

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,420
grow out so should I have blonde

76
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,220
highlights again and keep having to read

77
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,110
diet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really bad for your hair</font>

78
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,140
or should I have low lights like brown

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,530
highlights or should I let it grow out

80
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,840
and highlight the bottom and have hombre

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,299
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no idea i'm just so stuck</font>

82
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,510
so I decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you guys so comment</font>

83
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,780
below tell me what you guys think I

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,250
should do because I am seriously stuck

85
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,620
in a pickle so yeah I have to go I'm

86
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go eat dinner with my cousin</font>

87
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,980
and her boyfriend I'm totally

88
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,310
