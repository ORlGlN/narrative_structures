00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,860
and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was totally unexpected I never</font>

117
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,870
even asked for one but she<font color="#CCCCCC"> knew how much</font>

118
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,580
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought the other one was so childish</font>

119
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,889
so she got me this one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

120
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:46,840
and polka dots and I was so surprised oh

my gosh thank you so much mom and the

122
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,470

dollars there you go and the price that

125
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,009
she paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for was 30 so it was fifty</font>

126
00:05:03,009 --> 00:05:06,099
percent off which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy in my opinion</font>
