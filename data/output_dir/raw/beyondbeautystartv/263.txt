30
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,840
cold but I got my stuff I got a couple

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
other things too I ended up spending

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,570
like thirty dollars total which is kind

33
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,790
of a lot I guess but yeah I decided to

34
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">just do a quick hall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now might as</font>

well<font color="#CCCCCC"> just show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,720
dye that I chose for my roots it was

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard trying to find something</font>

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,400
that i had to guess was going to like

39
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,350
match my roots so I just went with this

40
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,290
l'oreal sublime mousse I use this once

41
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,210
and I really like this brand a lot and

42
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,549
just like the sub line ones I like a lot

43
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,400
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in fifty pure the medium</font>

44
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,009
brown so it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be kind of</font>

45
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a darkening and brown which my</font>

46
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,729
roots are really dark like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,189
especially so I'm I think this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

48
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,479
good and then I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got what I</font>
