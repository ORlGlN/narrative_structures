<font color="#E5E5E5">i haven't been making very many videos</font>

10
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:22,590
is honestly because my schedule has been

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,619
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sight and hectic the same exact</font>

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,180
thing happened to me last year and it's

13
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,160
happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me right now and it's all</font>

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,859
because of the tennis season<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you guys</font>

15
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:33,120
probably already know this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about it so much but i'm on my</font>

17
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,469
high school's tennis team which means

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,270
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have practiced every single day</font>

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,610
during the week and i come home at like

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,160
630 every single night<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then i have</font>

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat and take a shower and then by</font>

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,809
that it's like 730 or something and then

23
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a buttload of homework to do so I</font>

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,289
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any time to film videos</font>

25
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,199
during the week sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to</font>

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,090
film on like wednesday mornings because

27
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,460
I've wait arrival but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't able to</font>

28
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,989
last week because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd to like</font>

29
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,730
going earlier or something and then also

30
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,640
my schedule this year sucks so much I

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,979
literally don't see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my friends I</font>

32
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:09,990
see like one of my friends during math

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,490
class<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk during math</font>

34
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,659
class so the fact that I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> never see any</font>

35
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,400
of my friends during the week I want to

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single second with them</font>

37
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,630
during the weekend so I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

38
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,250
make the most of my weekends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend</font>

39
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,930
as much time as I can with my best

40
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,689
friends so that's why I really haven't

41
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to be making any videos and</font>

42
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">then plus I have like tennis matches and</font>

43
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,829
like meats and games during the weekends

44
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,560
as well so my schedule has just been so

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,630
insane with like all the homework and

46
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,869
tennis I've been having but um yeah I

47
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:44,659
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I'm gonna do honestly</font>

48
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to try to like start filming</font>

I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you guys would be</font>

130
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:54,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in this but maybe if you guys</font>

131
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,389
want to see me do it like what if I
