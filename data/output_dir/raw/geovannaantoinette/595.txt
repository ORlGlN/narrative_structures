00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,529
hey whats up beautiful people so today

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play around with lower body</font>

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,840
specifically here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys see me doing</font>

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,960
squats and I did about five sets of six

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,269
and I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticing a lot of</font>

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,130
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things about myself for</font>

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,430
example this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my first working set at</font>

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,930
175 and look at how slow it moves my bad

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 170 it doesn't move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that quickly</font>

10
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,480
but I don't remember it being that heavy

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,660
um so this is actually the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,610
the first few couple of weeks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,040
been playing wrong with low bar and then

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,170
I really widen my squats but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

15
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,879
at the second set here I started

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,219
noticing that it moves a little bit

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,140
faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first set and this is</font>

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,360
after i did all my mobility stretches

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,300
after did all my stretches<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did like</font>

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,010
really low<font color="#E5E5E5"> weight to get warm at this</font>

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,570
point in my head I was like dude I'm

22
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,420
completely warm not a problem so what I

23
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,899
started figuring out was oh crap there

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:02,399
we go the bar was actually slipping<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,019
my back because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still wasn't used to</font>

26
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,570
low bar and I noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was holding</font>

27
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,030
it with my thumbs around the bar and I

28
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,979
noticed that was actually hurting my

29
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,619
wrists more um so there were a lot of

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,820
little tweaks that I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticing</font>

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,520
that I needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make so here in this</font>

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,590
set you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see my thumb is completely</font>

33
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,759
away from the bar now and this felt so

34
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,040
good on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my wrist I actually had a widen</font>

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,829
up my grip as well and there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

36
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,930
less strain on my wrists at that point

37
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,790
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I noticed that I was</font>

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:35,009
starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move the weight a lot faster</font>

39
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:36,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm still doing the same weight this is</font>

40
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,710
my third set on doing reps of six here

41
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:42,600
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fastest i've been able</font>

42
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,450
to move it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what great crazier is the</font>

43
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,110
more sets that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do the faster that the</font>

44
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">stupid weight is moving so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i realized</font>

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my body needs to be really fatigued</font>

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,219
in order for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to feel super warm and</font>

47
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,840
to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weights faster so this is my</font>

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
fourth working set now now<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how</font>

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,180
quickly this stupid speeds going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

50
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,350
was wrong with me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't even know what</font>

51
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">my body does that look at that it looked</font>

52
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,410
a lot better than my first one and you

53
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,209
know you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that I would be</font>

54
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:14,209
tired by this point

55
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,189
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did like 24 sets already I</font>

56
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:19,680
mean I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did twenty four reps</font>

57
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,060
already so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would think I'd be like</font>

58
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">freaking exhausted but I'm not it's</font>

59
00:02:23,609 --> 00:02:26,159
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just like dude what's up</font>

60
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,109
so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay well that's kind of</font>

61
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:30,480
easy so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just finish up my last</font>

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,480
set with 175 and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even think I</font>

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,889
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting able to be able to do this</font>

64
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,689
cuz i already did so many sets and so

65
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,450
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> reps prior to this but look at that</font>

66
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,629
that was nothing I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I didn't</font>

67
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">need any spot I even called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bart over</font>

68
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:46,290
cuz I was like hey Bart I'm gonna

69
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,239
actually need your help<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

70
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely underestimated my</font>

71
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,450
capabilities and I'm like super

72
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,760
surprised at what I'm capable of doing

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

74
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,659
that your mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> freakin is so strong that</font>

75
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">it really does in my case at least that</font>

76
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:05,760
it really does hinder the amount of

77
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,260
weight that I can be moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> around I'm</font>

78
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,450
like dude what else does my mind me

79
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,359
up with stupid idiot mind I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

80
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,129
kidding but I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy that I</font>

81
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:16,230
got to see this because now I know what

82
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,079
to work on so I still<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my back</font>

83
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,639
injury and this is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

84
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:23,729
few times i started practicing a sumo

85
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,090
deadlifts and it felt so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uncomfortable</font>

86
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,709
first of i didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> point my toes out</font>

87
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,049
which I I here I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even tried it</font>

88
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:32,370
yet because I'm so new to this movement

89
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,290
I here gives you more leverage when

90
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,629
you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of on when</font>

91
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,099
you're trying to pop up with the weight

92
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:40,319
and it still feels very uncomfortable

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,629
for me my hips feel super tight i have

94
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:45,659
like no flexibility my hair is jacked up

95
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,159
not that that has anything to do with

96
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything but this movement just feels so</font>

97
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,220
awkward so I just kept playing around

98
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,930
with it right here my back started

99
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,759
hurting which already tells me that I'm

100
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing it wrong because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your bat your</font>

101
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,689
lower back should feel no sort of strain

102
00:04:00,689 --> 00:04:03,060
and now that's where my injury is in my

103
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,340
lower back so I'm just like oh crap dude

104
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,099
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> what am i doing wrong but you know</font>

105
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:09,629
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just had a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of muscle it through</font>

106
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">it and just kind of believe in the</font>

107
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,859
technique I keep refining and tweaking

108
00:04:13,859 --> 00:04:17,548
the technique because I here again for

109
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,320
tall people this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best type of</font>

110
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> live to do um but it's a lot harder</font>

111
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:27,300
coming off the floor so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumb ass</font>

112
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,099
have even started doing this with a

113
00:04:29,099 --> 00:04:30,990
deficit because it makes it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

114
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,370
harder because it's like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

115
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,750
past the floor now to pick up wait so

116
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,099
here I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like all right I guess I</font>

117
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">need a little bit more power so I'm</font>

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,389
gonna put my hood on not that that does

119
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:44,849
 but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just feels</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better because my</font>

120
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,860
hair won't be in my way as much but here

121
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,780
I go I still don't really understand the

122
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:51,120
setup that much um it takes me like

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,810
about 20 million a squiggles to get my

124
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,099
shins close enough to the bar where it

125
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:57,750
feels comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it takes like</font>

126
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:00,180
like another 20 million times to grip

127
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,490
the bar um but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one actually looks</font>

128
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,039
pretty cool but it's so inconsistent

129
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,509
because the first one pops up really

130
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,889
good second one popped up really good

131
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,770
but then after that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know i think</font>

132
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,770
my my hips shoot up way too fast or look

133
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,780
at that I struggled so much on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third</font>

134
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,879
one I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I'm doing wrong so</font>

135
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,500
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys have any friendly tips out</font>

136
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,180
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm more than like grateful and so</font>

137
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,409
honored and humbled if you guys can

138
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:27,270
shoot over some tips when it comes to

139
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,699
sumo deadlifts again my back started

140
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,099
giving me problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was like oh man</font>

141
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,270
I don't know if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep doing</font>

142
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">this all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right it I guess I'm gonna</font>

143
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:37,500
keep going that's kind of what my

144
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,139
thought processes when I'm working out

145
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,909
um I truly tried really really really

146
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,169
really really hard not to bitch out

147
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:44,909
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it comes to lower body</font>

148
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,380
because lower body is like my strongest

149
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,810
and it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the most funnest one</font>

150
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,110
for me um but I was like dude I can't

151
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,610
take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I stopped I'm</font>

152
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:55,409
supposed to do four sets but i just did

153
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,909
too and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like okay I'm gonna do</font>

154
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">this for my back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok never fight putting</font>

155
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,639
it back that was like the stupidest idea

156
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,430
I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have ever had for myself so I</font>

157
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">just moved on and I started doing wide</font>

158
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:10,770
grip pull ups with some band assistance

159
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,259
cuz I can barely do regular pool whoops

160
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,860
um strict pull-ups as it is and moving

161
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,940
it wider makes it that much more

162
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,279
difficult but it's a great back workout

163
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,009
and from pulling conventional I noticed

164
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my upper back rounds a lot so that</font>

165
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:26,669
