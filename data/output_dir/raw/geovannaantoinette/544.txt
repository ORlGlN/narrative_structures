36
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,729
through the roof right now move down to

37
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,220
competition bench my prescribed weight

38
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,880
was 105 and I'm actually really starting

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,759
to enjoy bench now because it's becoming

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,829
a more consistent lift for me I'm i

41
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:37,079
switched up my grip my grip feels really

42
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,360
good I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the weight flying up now</font>

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,579
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have never really felt</font>

44
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like I can feel that perfect point on my</font>

45
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,140
chest where if the bar supposed to touch

46
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,970
and it just flies right up it's been

47
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,560
beautiful for me it's a confidence

48
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,750
booster so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love that i found moved on</font>

49
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,079
to more volume it again three sets of

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,560
five at 90

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,740
that felt like a slight struggle on my

52
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,750
first set but the second and third were

53
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,090
easy money he felt really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good I also</font>

54
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,890
tribute that to be taking a little bit

55
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,130
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks in between all good and I</font>

56
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">finished out my workout with two</font>

57
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:12,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">different types of circuits the first</font>

58
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,090
one being overhead press<font color="#E5E5E5"> who loves and a</font>

59
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,880
jump rope for minute and that was three

60
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,580
sets of ten and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it more</font>

61
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,560
on the cardio side so I would try to

62
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,200
keep my rest on below a minute and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

63
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,660
the second circuit was upright rows

64
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,299
waited this but I'm a weakling so

65
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:32,920
there's no wait other than body weight

66
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,299
um and sweat and he's feel really good

67
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:39,069
it's not super taxing but I could feel

68
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,620
it really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing on specific</font>

69
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,349
