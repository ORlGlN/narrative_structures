1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,580
hey what up y'all so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm working</font>

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,290
on upper body as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here i'm</font>

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,019
setting up with 30 pound change and

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:12,599
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 on each side but before i get</font>

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,250
into all that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to stress the</font>

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,910
importance of actually recording most if

7
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,619
not all of your lips especially if

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,930
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to refine a technique I</font>

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,930
highly highly highly recommend just

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,369
recording yourself and<font color="#CCCCCC"> those some of you</font>

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,080
might feel like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of awkward or might</font>

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,640
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like dude what the hell are people</font>

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of me if they see me like</font>

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,450
recording myself like how

15
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,600
narcissistic am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i but all that</font>

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,420
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all about refining and</font>

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,120
perfecting the technique because as I

18
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,399
recorded myself all I was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,469
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get better I want to</font>

20
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:47,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">get my numbers up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz as you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,920
here I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 10 because</font>

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was just way too heavy with these</font>

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,050
30 pound chains on each side so as I

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:57,420
looked at my technique I noticed a lot

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,219
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was doing wrong first</font>

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,500
for example if you haven't noticed every

27
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,110
time I grip the bar my fingers start

28
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,020
twitching and like I I'm like fixing my

29
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,119
grip and whatnot and what I notice now

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,090
is as soon as you unwrap the bar your

31
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,270
body is completely tight and solid and

32
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,000
as soon as you let go of<font color="#E5E5E5"> any part of</font>

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,939
your body you can't get the same

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:23,280
strength back way back when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to</font>

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,100
tighten up again for example if you're

36
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,619
squatting you get to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom of your</font>

37
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,770
squat and let's say you just exhale now

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,180
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> exhaling</font>

39
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,920
letting loose of all those muscles then

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,300
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tighten back up and then</font>

41
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,980
getting out of the hole that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

42
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,880
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're trying to do when you're</font>

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">benching look at my fingers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right there</font>

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,070
like why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that so instead of</font>

45
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,590
keeping tight I lose the force that I

46
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:49,330
had when I initially set up and then I'm

47
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,400
trying to like get it back ain't gonna

48
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,500
have it another thing that I noticed was

49
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,710
I wouldn't I like I would hear people

50
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,240
say all right you realize your<font color="#E5E5E5"> life's</font>

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">pret your last like engage your last I'm</font>

52
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,650
like what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that mean I</font>

53
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means so</font>

54
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,910
specifically for my females out there

55
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,310
what you can imagine is most of you

56
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,080
girls know what it clutches right so

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of like a purse imagine it</font>

58
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,470
without the straps so when you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

59
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,480
clutch or when you're trying to hold the

60
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,830
clutch you don't hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with your hands</font>

61
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're actually holding it underneath</font>

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,239
your arms so imagine flexing that that

63
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,580
muscle on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sidewall your lat</font>

64
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,220
obviously and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then pressing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that against</font>

65
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,780
your arm where you keep where there's

66
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,850
like no gaps like if you try to stick

67
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">friggin a credit card in there it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

68
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna happen so that is literally what</font>

69
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,370
you want to feel when you're benching

70
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,840
especially when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want brought the way</font>

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,959
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel your lot and the side</font>

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,330
of your your arms pressing up against

73
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,340
each other another thing that I noticed

74
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,160
is I wouldn't bend the bar what that

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,690
what that means is as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as I would in</font>

76
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:51,700
rocket my hands would pretty much stay

77
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,230
in a neutral position but now what I do

78
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:56,430
I imagine unwrapping the bar and then um

79
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,830
like twisting a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I grip the</font>

80
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,010
bars hard as I can and H I just

81
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,880
imagine me bending<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar so apply that</font>

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,700
and I will guarantee that just

83
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,380
unwrapping it you're gonna feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

84
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,190
holy this bar feels a million times

85
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,299
lighter now right here I got stuck

86
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,959
because my bar group was it moving in a

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,120
straight motion it was like it looked

88
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,880
like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin s</font>

89
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,760
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that it has like for me at</font>

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,560
least it's like ninety percent mental

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,270
because as soon as I hear the thoughts

92
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,370
in my head say anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like oh</font>

93
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,780
this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy oh my god you're</font>

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,460
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> breathing hold up and if I can hear</font>

95
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:40,620
all these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head is saying</font>

96
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,380
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my lip then I'm completely not in</font>

97
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,620
the zone and I'm gonna up so all I

98
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,330
do is you shut that voice up in my head

99
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,120
and I just I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even think I just</font>

100
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel it out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and immediately it feels</font>

101
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,800
better here because I have problems with

102
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,050
getting out of the royalties<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me so</font>

103
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,630
part was counting<font color="#E5E5E5"> three seconds before</font>

104
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,820
would even press my chest and then that

105
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,670
explosion like pushing the bar straight

106
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,110
up so that's what I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

107
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,690
perfecting this one and this technique

108
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,970
another thing that I noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font>

109
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,860
neglecting a lot of the time that I'm

110
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,410
still kind of trance effect is big<font color="#CCCCCC"> drug</font>

111
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,480
as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like my my</font>

112
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,160
pelvic area is kind of pushing up oh

113
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just touch and go amrap so you</font>

114
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:30,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably can't see the lake drive but</font>

115
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,080
imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> as soon as the bar touches your</font>

116
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,360
chest up not doing it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> either I'm</font>

117
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,770
slightly doing that you can see how like

118
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,230
my pelvic is kind of thrusting upwards

119
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,390
well you don't want to thrust upwards

120
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,280
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from your pelvic</font>

121
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,410
area it's actually being generated from

122
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,390
the bottom of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet so it goes from</font>

123
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,950
the bottom of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> feet it transfers</font>

124
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,410
into your butt and it pushes not

125
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,310
straight up but it's more<font color="#CCCCCC"> like pushing</font>

126
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:59,820
up but your head is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so it</font>

127
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,770
would be like me<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushing towards Bart's</font>

128
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,110
cross cuz i need trying to hit Bart's

129
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,240
balls pretty much that's how you want it

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,730
to feel so you want to have every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

131
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,160
part of your body tight and solid<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

132
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,810
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> your glutes like your</font>

133
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,820
glutes should make you rise off that

134
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,490
seat not literally the glutes part but

135
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,290
you're squeezing them so hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

136
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,590
they're so freaking rock solid that your

137
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,510
body naturally just

138
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,100
again don't get me<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong I'm not saying</font>

139
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,020
your butt should leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> this seat because</font>

140
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,910
it shouldn't I'm saying you're squeezing

141
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,740
it so much that your body tends to rise

142
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,950
so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am doing am reps at this video</font>

143
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,870
actually we missed it but this video

144
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,110
actually made me see that I am stronger

145
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">when it comes to close grip so I'm</font>

146
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,180
finishing up my workouts with some

147
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,580
stabilizers right here as you can see

148
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm doing dumbbell a seated overhead</font>

149
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,710
press and this is like a double whammy

150
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,390
because it's gonna work my shoulders and

151
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,910
it's also gonna work on my stabilizer

152
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,030
muscles so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a barbell which</font>

153
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,800
is hung solid piece it's a lot easier to

154
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">move up and down this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm working on too</font>

155
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,490
deep into pieces trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>
