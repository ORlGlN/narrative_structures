00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:05,700
hey what a beautiful people so today is

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,160
a tuesday<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm actually they behind my</font>

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">workout i was supposed to work out</font>

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,120
yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I was filming JK views all</font>

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,599
day from ten a.m. to about 10pm last

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,480
night so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to move my I had to shift</font>

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,830
over my workout for Monday to Tuesday

8
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,369
today um and it felt pretty good today

9
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a pretty easy workout I hit my daily</font>

10
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,930
max pretty usual 205 I really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,039
get comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that weight I want</font>

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,420
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be super consistent I don't ever</font>

13
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,520
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to feel that I want to open my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meat</font>

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,600
at a minimum 205 and then I move<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,760
high bar squads which I ultimately hey

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,399
because I'm a low bar lifter and that

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,860
always feels very comfortable for me but

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,570
when I have to switch over to high bar I

19
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,620
don't even know how to set up properly

20
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,899
so you'll see me a kind of like try to

21
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,000
find a place or a groove in my back

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,820
where I can stick that bar I actually

23
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">increased my weight on that and I moved</font>

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,440
up to

25
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh so yeah I really try to increase my</font>

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,960
weight<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the high bar i increased it by</font>

27
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 pounds from last week and it felt</font>

28
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,979
pretty good I did to get into the zone

29
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it tend to want to like go ahead of</font>

30
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,479
myself and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go really fast and</font>

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,100
I'm out and then that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I lose</font>

32
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,350
focus in my form and how everything

33
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be working but today I made sure</font>

34
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:20,009
that I just slowed it the fuck down and

35
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:21,630
I felt every single groove and I felt

36
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,340
every single set and like everyone

37
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,630
always tells you you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat your</font>

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,860
set like it's the last one um so today I

39
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,600
was conscious and aware of that and they

40
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,240
tried to do that this car is going

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,050
fucking slow then I moved into my

42
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:39,810
competition bench ok 10 but I'm treating

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,850
it again as something that I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

44
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,960
opening up with some there should be

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,630
super comfortable with so it's getting

46
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,789
better every single week I've moved from

47
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:50,220
a closed script out to you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:52,229
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> grip and I'm forgetting that my</font>

49
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,670
close grip is a lot stronger than my

50
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,069
regular grip so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really</font>

51
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:57,210
comforting and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting very</font>

52
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,850
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this Chris so it's been</font>

53
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,770
nothing the progress then I move it to

54
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,720
leg<font color="#CCCCCC"> off a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bench press which is fucking</font>

55
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,520
crazy cuz i think i have such a<font color="#CCCCCC"> greasy</font>

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,890
leg Drive that it fucks up a pig my form

57
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,220
when I'm benching and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do</font>

58
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,830
pounds last with my legs up then my

59
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,140
actual max right now so that shows me

60
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,150
that my upper body strength is stronger

61
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:19,370
than I give myself credit and I need to

62
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:23,410
stop being a book a bitch I moved into

63
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,390
deficit speed pools I'm assuming dead

64
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:28,100
lifter and that's like my favorite but

65
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:31,280
um I have a super weak back all around

66
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,190
so in efforts to make that strong I<font color="#CCCCCC"> am</font>

67
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,080
now forgetting that I folsom oh and I'm

68
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,190
just trying to perfect my conventional

69
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,140
pool so I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> only focusing on that</font>

70
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,690
um and these felt really great I

71
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,430
actually moved up five pounds last week

72
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,070
I do 135 this week I'm doing 140 not mad

73
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,260
at that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just closed up my workout</font>

74
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,500
with some leg extensions pretty easy um

75
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,020
I added 10 pounds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too and I</font>

76
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,490
closed it off at 65 so that was pretty

77
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,800
cool but yeah I want to keep increasing

78
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,300

79
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,300
