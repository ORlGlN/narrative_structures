134
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,240
dated someone shorter than you honestly

135
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,230
here we go with the ambiguity again um

136
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:18,860
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really rare for me to just pick</font>

137
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,290
someone to go out with based on their

138
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,810
height um yes height does play a factor

139
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,200
in it but it's not the make-or-break

140
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,560
factor I actually have dated people are

141
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,700
shorter than myself

142
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,460
my very first boyfriend in high school

143
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,280
was I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was like 56 57 and i'm 5</font>

144
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,620
11 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i was 5 11 in high school</font>

145
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,560
as well so he was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> short like my</font>

146
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,450
shoulders here and he was like literally

147
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,250
up to here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were together for</font>

148
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a year so um hi Willie doesn't</font>

149
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,170

150
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:56,060
never let myself and I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say</font>

151
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,030
I only date guys taller than me because

152
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:03,140
I'm pretty confident in myself so yeah I

153
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,640
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need someone to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be taller</font>
