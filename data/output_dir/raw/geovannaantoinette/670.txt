question um why do these girls like

ashes scumbags losers um a lot of these

99
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,950
girls tend to be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the insecure</font>

100
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,620
side so um they might have some like

101
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,010
bigger issues with their own family that

102
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,488
um that maybe they seek out some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

103
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:26,080
no it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an easy answer to</font>

104

give you just because there's it's like

105
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,130

106
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,480
type of environment something I'll grow

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">up in if you kept on the carpet dynamics</font>

108
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,790
that she has with her family<font color="#E5E5E5"> members so</font>

109
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,290
this one's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case-by-case</font>

110
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,900
but from my experience I've noticed that

111
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these girls that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do go out with</font>

112
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:46,000
these when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were party bags are</font>

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,950
assholes tends to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they just</font>

114
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,650
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have self-confidence on they lack</font>

115
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,110
that confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

116
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,600
and yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sad because um</font>

117
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,790
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to you know these guys are</font>

118
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,650
you call a solution you're actually

119
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,500
coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same boat there they</font>

120
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,230
lack the<font color="#E5E5E5"> self confidence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to so you know</font>

121
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these two people that you know</font>

122
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,770
like the confidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

123
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,930
connect and and it makes this really

124
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,420
horrible turbulent relationship and if

125
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,390
you or a friend of yours isn't as a

126
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship you really do need to like</font>

127
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:21,310
set them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sit them down and just</font>

128
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,930
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and see where they're</font>

129
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,060
coming from see how they you know how

130
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,380
they feel about the relationship and

131
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,450
where they see the relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> going um</font>

132
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:31,030
also I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean you might just be wrong and</font>

133
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,340
you really don't know what the dynamics

134
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,080
of the relationship actually is because

135
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,860
unless you're in in their shoes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24-7 you</font>

136
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,000
really don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the actual</font>

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,690
douchebag is you know the girl might put

138
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,160
up a good front in front of her friends

139
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in public where she makes herself</font>

140
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,600
look really will be perfect but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

141
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,270
behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenes she might be like</font>

142
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,560
tearing him down and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> matt</font>

143
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">crafton um and he's just probably a</font>

144
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,490
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

145
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,900
like hey I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to take your shit</font>

146
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,789
but i mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> like i said i really i really</font>

147
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:03,580
don't know but based off my experience

148
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,250
like that self-confidence and the only

149
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,400
way to get them out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is just you</font>

150
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,500
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of talk to them but</font>

151
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,090
you don't really tell them too much just

152
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:16,120
because you might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the short end of</font>

153
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,160
the stick and they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be like</font>

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,539
what the hell you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even my friend</font>

155
00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:21,160
want you backing me up type<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so</font>

156
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,289
it's really like those double-edged

157
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,900
swords have a situation where if you do

158
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,940
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backfire in your face</font>

159
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,830
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't do something in my</font>

160
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,900
backfire in your face so Justin you

161
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,580
really just just make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work</font>

162
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,050
at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different angles and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

163
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,889
stress all possibilities out and and and

164
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,080
see if you can if it's your friend or

165
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,520
pick you as a friend or as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person is</font>

166
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a relationship that can make things</font>

167
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,909
better but outside of that I really

168
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,449
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what else to say um but again</font>

169
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:53,979
I will reiterate it based off my

170
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,270
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and she's people that my</font>

171
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:58,300
confidence I'm in themselves that to put

<font color="#E5E5E5">their self-image type of</font>

173
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,520
