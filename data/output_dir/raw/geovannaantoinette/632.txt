00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,120
hello what is up y'all so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,160
back and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing you guys my lower</font>

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,679
body workouts i am doing box squats

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,080
today and this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to help</font>

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,630
with my hip movement and your hips are

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,490
pretty much responsible for getting you

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,460
out of the bottom position specifically

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:23,250
today I'm doing box squats wide stance

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,680
and I think it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,930
important that you switch up your stance

11
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,630
because if you play sports like myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

12
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,729
play volleyball um you're never gonna

13
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,309
like try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like jump up and hit a ball</font>

14
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:37,680
with like the same stance every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">time so it's a lot more of functional</font>

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,510
fitness by switching up the stance here

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,920
and there are some tans and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am doing</font>

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">pyramid style so that means i am adding</font>

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,879
more weight and doing less reps today

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm trying to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,570
different in terms of my camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> movement</font>

22
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,620

belt dude and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another position</font>

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,829
look at that slope I'm still practicing

34
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,159
low bar at this point um I recently went

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,939
gonna see more high bar but here it's

39
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">just low bar and I felt like I could</font>

40
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:43,320
have done my stance a lot more wider

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,060
this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time actually did</font>

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,939
wide stance bought squats and it was

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,049
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty damn beneficial oh fail</font>

44
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,590
here we go squat cleans technically this

45
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,310
is a power squat clean and I like it

46
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,280
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a full body workout I</font>

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,170
didn't realize how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your body you</font>

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,520

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,120
kept repeating it over and over again

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,920
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird too much about the</font>

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,970
weight was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just way too light for me</font>

64
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,520
definitely not enough pop in the hips
