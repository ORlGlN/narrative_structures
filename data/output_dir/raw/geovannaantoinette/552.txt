00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:04,980
hey whats up beautiful people so today

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,280
is a beautiful day but it's kind of

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,759
raining so it's a beautiful day but it's

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,740
kind of a bummer because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not leveled</font>

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,800
up in my room under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the covers but all</font>

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,900
in all it's still a good day I<font color="#CCCCCC"> opened up</font>

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,170
my workout with speed squats I did it to

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,060
see percent of my max my new max being

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,369
225 I finally hit that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been chasing</font>

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,599
that forever now um and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tribute that</font>

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,700
that I've been chasing it forever to the

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">fact that i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really a consistent</font>

13
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,309
liver lifter flipper flipper<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

14
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:41,399
consistent lifter prior to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hitting that</font>

15
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:44,730
225 I took a month off not because I

16
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,120
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but one I got sick too I just</font>

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,739
really didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the time to invest</font>

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,149
into working out so I was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forced</font>

19
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,860
to take that month off but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,420
cool to come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then finally hit</font>

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,270
225 I wish I had footage for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,800
for that but it actually came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,350
surprise to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that I was able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hit it</font>

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,220
speed squats at 135 at sixty percent of

25
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:13,430
my max and it felt really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so at the</font>

26
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,130
bottom I did a three-second pause and to

27
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:17,900
ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hit those three seconds I</font>

28
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,270
had bar counted for me so that's why you

29
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,930
can see him<font color="#E5E5E5"> going like 123 and then</font>

30
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,390
you're supposed to just shoot out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:28,460
hole which felt really really easy today

32
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,070
it was a super confidence booster then

33
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,009
it moves into speed bench and I had to

34
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,720
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bent it's like the worst bench</font>

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,549
in the world but all in all it's cool

36
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,530
just because since they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> speeds into</font>

37
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">a speed bench I'll need to sixty percent</font>

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,020
of my max hi max be 110 which is so

39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,170
sauce money and so sorry again it just

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,700
doesn't increase because I'm not a

41
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,610
consistent lift there and uh so I just

42
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,319
stay weak there's no other<font color="#E5E5E5"> real way to</font>

43
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,420
explain it other than explaining the

44
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:00,350
truth so um my<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did my sixty percent</font>

45
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,390
was supposed to be at 65 but I thought

46
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was like gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be way too easy on</font>

47
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,909
so i decided two point five on each side

48
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:12,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">and making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it seven so i did five sets</font>

49
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:16,790
of two at 70 and it felt really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

50
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,799
again with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three-second pause at the</font>

51
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:22,820
bottom shooting it out so did I keep

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,859
real se as I lose a lot of tightness on

53
00:02:24,859 --> 00:02:27,440
my upper back and I need to work on that

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot so I'm gonna be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more consistent</font>

55
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:34,400
I'm actually committing to a meet this

56
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,859
September right now we're in May so

57
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,540
that's definitely going to happen and

58
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,710
that's definitely motivation for me

59
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,970
it on on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I am also cutting a</font>

60
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more some tracking my macros</font>

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,220
and right now i'm only at seventeen

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,460
fifty calories so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure that's going</font>

63
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a poll on me pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but i</font>

64
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,880
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's where the mental toughness</font>

65
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,560
comes in something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've always said</font>

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,120
that I need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on so I'm looking</font>

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward to strengthening all that and</font>

68
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,480
then so from bench I moved on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my</font>

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,990
dad's lips so recently as you guys have

70
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">been watching or those of you that have</font>

71
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,630
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the two of you</font>

72
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,360
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> set a watch um I always have issues</font>

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,370
with my upper back it's constantly

74
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,170
rounding there is no pain there is

75
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,910
nothing going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that like really</font>

76
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,070
affects me but I'm just not being an

77
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:26,160
efficient lifter<font color="#CCCCCC"> I warm up with 125 and</font>

78
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,370
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> I warm up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with 135 185 and jump</font>

79
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,710
straight to 225 warm up with that but

80
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,630
since now I'm pulling conventional it

81
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,280
feels a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit foreign to me so I</font>

82
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,740
thought I was warming up at 225 I did

83
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,890
that for three<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy money I felt my back</font>

84
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,960
felt great so I just was like okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,910
is dope this is regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

86
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:48,240
pull over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 sumos and I'm like okay</font>

87
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,790
this is this is easy cake or easy peasy

88
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,130

00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,260
Hawkins

00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,390
and I look at that bar who's like my

92
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,610
coach constantly taking my form and

93
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,980
tweaking my form and he was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> staring</font>

94
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,909
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> me what I like what the heck is going</font>

95
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,599

103
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">been recording it from the side so that</font>

104
