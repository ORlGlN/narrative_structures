of just letting go of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leash my dumb</font>

Tyson was still going full speed I

126
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,790

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,970
just seen this happen to someone else

130
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:09,130
cuz I'm sure it was hilarious and I wish

131
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">that somebody would have recorded it</font>

132
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,450
