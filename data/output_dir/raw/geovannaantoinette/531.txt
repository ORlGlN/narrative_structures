7
00:00:16,009 --> 00:00:21,560
September so and that's for us PA on but

8
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,510
when I spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the founder Steve</font>

9
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dennison he actually mentioned that that</font>

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,740
meat is actually getting pushed back a

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,900
week in September so that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of messes</font>

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,309
up my plans because I was planning on

13
00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:38,089
going to Hawaii um the week that now

14
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,549
they changed the meat too so I found

15
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meat that I'm going to do in</font>

16
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:43,699
August with everyone else I was very

17
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:45,799
good at the pepper we moved it up a

18
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,500
couple weeks on so instead of it being

19
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,180
September the first week in September

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,680
now we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different meeting and</font>

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,330
I'm I'm no longer in San Diego we're

22
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:55,220
doing a different media in Anaheim and

23
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,839
that one's actually august twenty

24
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:59,379
seconds so we kinda have to speed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

25
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,610
programming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bart came up with a new</font>

26
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,989
program so that's like you guys are

27
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:06,170
watching now I opened up my workout set

28
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:10,160
at a high bar asked grass squat three by

29
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,710
five and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could do it at 185</font>

30
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,020
because that for me is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arky five</font>

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,180
or six it's actually pretty light but

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,810
that's me doing it with low bar and

33
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,830
about so I drop it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 135 and I do</font>

34
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,720
it three by five because I'm to actually

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,430
just trying to work on speed and I never

36
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,530
knew high bar so it's mainly speed and

37
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,899
warm checking it's basically what I'm

38
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:36,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing today was dominantly bench and</font>

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,360
upper body day so I moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,460
competition bench three by three I did

41
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,750
that at 95 and it felt solid but it just

42
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,399
didn't feel fast the parts like hey you

43
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what why don't you just move it</font>

44
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:51,060
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your regular grip keep the same</font>

45
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,399
mechanics that you learned when you

46
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:55,289
switched it out to the mark bell grip

47
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:57,479
which she told you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go wider so this</font>

48
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my last set 95 and it flew right up</font>

49
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,570
it was absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing the bar tops</font>

50
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,460
changed my you know my positioning my

51
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,990
back change everything changed because I

52
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,690
just switched my grip so I kind of kept

53
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:11,700
that mechanics as Bart was talking about

54
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,739
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just moved my grip back to what</font>

55
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:16,170
I'm used to my normal grip and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full</font>

56
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">write-ups I think I finally finally</font>

57
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,950
successfully found my grip so that was a

58
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">super plus for me today and then I just</font>

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">had my one rep max at 105 with a</font>

60
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">semi-new grip with a new mechanic same</font>

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,239
grip and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually flew up to to my</font>

62
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:34,920
surprise at 105 and it felt really

63
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">fucking good so I'm super excited my</font>

64
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,760
bench is finally going up and then I

65
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,590
moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> to overload and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

66
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">banned at two by three and it pulls it</font>

67
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,260
out at 115 and

68
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,660
without 30 Boston fast and I'm just

69
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,420
super excited I i was like thinking do I

70
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,550
should add you know at least five more

71
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,380
pounds to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm like forget it I</font>

72
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to fill it and then</font>

73
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,710
completely fuck up this high like my

74
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,540
body<font color="#E5E5E5"> is telling me hey you kind of</font>

75
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,310
struggled a little bit let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

76
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,380
it where we're at so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm glad I listened</font>

77
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">to my body what's going on right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

78
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:09,500
hope everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and then I moved</font>

79
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,200
its a 2 inch above<font color="#CCCCCC"> trash bin pressed on</font>

80
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually gonna help me the</font>

81
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,980
most because at the top especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

82
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,330
I'm down here I don't know why I said

83
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's up but when I'm down by my chest</font>

84
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,040
I don't know how to stay tight for long

85
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,540
periods of time so what is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pattern</font>

86
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">use as soon as I bring it down I don't</font>

87
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,280
know if I'm trying to breathe or what

88
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,780
happens but I kind of lose tightness

89
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,300
then I get tight again and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

90
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,120
press it but um for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys that</font>

91
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,400
know how to bench you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how fucking</font>

92
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,770
stupid that is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you lose all</font>

93
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,690
strength at the bottom if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so</font>

94
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,630
um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 inch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off the chest pin press is</font>

95
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,400
actually helping me maintain that

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,810
tightness because I start from the

97
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,700
bottom position so that felt really good

98
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,070
then I moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> into close grip which used</font>

99
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,040
to be my strongest with um but now it's

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually just there it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing I've</font>

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,530
actually trained my body to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

102
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,910
at a normal grip and I don't look

103
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,580
fucking ridiculous with like my farm is

104
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,290
screwing all the time like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm fucking</font>

105
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,810
dancing I'm like that that air machine

106
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,610
that they put at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car like at the car</font>

107
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:12,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot so that they can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your attention</font>

108
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,610
that's what I look like when i benched

109
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,470
was like move

110
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,029
then I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to overhead lat pulldown</font>

111
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,579
felt really good to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 always</font>

112
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">admire my back cuz I never get to see my</font>

113
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,510
back so anytime I can fill my back I'm

114
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,730
gonna film it cuz I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like dude</font>

115
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,590

116
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,320
see the ribs you could see my spine it

117
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,630
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just horrendous I had zero muscle</font>

118
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,460
back there so now when I see my back I'm

119
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like dude lifting has changed my</font>

120
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,310

122
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,490
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> fucking look amazing not to try to</font>

123
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,120
toot my own horn<font color="#E5E5E5"> but honesty where I was</font>

124
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,460
to where I am now world<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a difference</font>

125
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't change it for the world</font>

126
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:59,380

130
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,990
again super setting that and then I

131
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,600
closed it out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sled if you can</font>
