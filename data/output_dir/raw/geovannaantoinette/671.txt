67
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,500
different colleges so the guys have a

68
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,180
musical set that they have together but

69
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,650
they have put together up their original

70
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,280
music um so they play that live so I'm

71
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,290
the one you be plugging them into all

72
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,370
these different events in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

73
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,110
different schools so any schools or any

74
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,400
colleges or any kids<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are out there</font>

75
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,709
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are in college or high school</font>

76
00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:01,900

live contact me and we'll make something

78
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,980
happen so they can come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your school</font>

79
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,019
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much takes up most of my</font>

80
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:10,989
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it keeps me away from really</font>

81
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:13,620
pretty much just being out amongst

82
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,880
social people which is because it takes

83
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,069
up so much of my time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is the</font>

84
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,930
reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> unable to vlog</font>

85
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:22,450
