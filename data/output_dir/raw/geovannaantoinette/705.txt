hey what's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys geo here um so for</font>

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:06,060

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,950
this is the only time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually have to</font>

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,889
haul today but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past two weeks or</font>

5
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,019
technically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past eight days I've</font>

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,199
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking an improv class and I've</font>

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,539
been taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> theirs to fun two forms of</font>

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,490
improv that you can take their short

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,039
form in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> long for and I was taking a</font>

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,130
long long form improv class at UCB which

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,699
stands for upright citizens<font color="#CCCCCC"> brigade</font>

12
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:32,610
improv class it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one-on-one plus it</font>

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">was just the basics is my first time</font>

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,170
ever taking it and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said there's</font>

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,090
two forms<font color="#E5E5E5"> a short form in long form i</font>

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:40,440
was taking the long form and the long

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,440
form pretty much is they just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a</font>

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,270
suggestion<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you start from Ground</font>

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,940
Zero you start from that suggestion so

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally the way it worked with us it</font>

21
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,340
was um you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce ourselves</font>

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we get a suggestion from the</font>

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,360
audience so then the audience would say

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,050
orange and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we go in our own heads</font>

25
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,750
and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just think of stories or</font>

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,840
anything that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is related to an orange</font>

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,960
for us so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example I'll just walk you</font>

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,299
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thought process so the</font>

29
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,939
audience suggestion is orange orange

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,750
makes me think of a tropical punch which

31
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,970
makes me think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of summertime so then I</font>

32
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,689
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a monologue or story of</font>

33
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:27,299
this crazy summer that I had when I went

34
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">fishing with my dad so then I'm</font>

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:30,380
explaining my story to the audience

36
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,880
while my team members which is about

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,110
like five to eight people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

38
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,930
um they hear my story right so then I

39
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:39,100
continued on like yeah I used to go

40
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,600
fishing with my dad down in like baja

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,760
california and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i remember this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one time</font>

42
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,770
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're young you really</font>

43
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,020
see your dad is like a role model so

44
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,110
then you know when he took when we were

45
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,630
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boat he didn't take motion sickness</font>

46
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,460
pills so that he started vomiting all

47
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,200
over the place and I was horrified

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,729
because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my first time soon</font>

49
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,520
my first time on a boat it was my first

50
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,200
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> fishing with my dad and then I get</font>

51
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and it was the most like</font>

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,670
disgusting thing I've ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

53
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,500
terrified<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was like I'm gonna die</font>

54
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,709
today so as I'm explaining that um my

55
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:13,510
team members<font color="#CCCCCC"> are thinking of different</font>

56
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,739
scenarios<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play on</font>

57
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:17,620
stage so then nobody knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

58
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to tell this story nobody knows</font>

59
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,739
what's going to happen next so I walk

60
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,110
off stage or I walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the back and then</font>

61
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,600
um my friends begin improv<font color="#CCCCCC"> E or not my</font>

62
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,830
friends about my group they begin

63
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,290
improving or what we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play like</font>

64
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,989
what we like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to call is play so then</font>

65
00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:33,880
normally it begins the scene will begin

66
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,920
with two people one person walks on

67
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,420
there pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person that has</font>

68
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,310
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial idea of what they're going</font>

69
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,410
to do so the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> will walk up and</font>

70
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,810
then they begin acting out the scene not

71
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,209
not the scene that I just talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

72
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,769
they don't act out the story they just

73
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:50,470
act out what they found funny in my

74
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,299
story so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could even be something like</font>

75
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,420
the first guy walks on and he bars and

76
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,700
the second person walks on has no idea

77
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,980
what's going on but just plays along and

78
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,480
they begin barfing so the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

79
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,310
could just be of a person barfing and

80
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,930
it's the greatest thing because it's

81
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,670
like we never know what's going to

82
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,750
happen

83
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,480
um so it's just a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun because</font>

84
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's like it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like remember the time</font>

85
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,830
when you were young and like we knew

86
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,390
where kidding you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys would play tag or</font>

87
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,570
you would play lava and what lava is for

88
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">those of you that don't know it's when</font>

89
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,260
the ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're standing on is</font>

90
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,390
hot lava and you try to do everything

91
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,930
you possibly can to not die in this hot

92
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,280
lava so um you try your<font color="#CCCCCC"> best to just</font>

93
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,620
jump on couches jump on tables jump on

94
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,410
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the lava so that</font>

95
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,630
you don't die and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty much</font>

96
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,550
what we do in our heads when we improv

97
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,459
we create this world in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our heads that</font>

98
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,650
is real so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to start saying</font>

99
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,110
that we're Harry monkeys then we're

100
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,030
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the top of our</font>

101
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,800
intelligence and we're going to be

102
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,239
monkeys in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no one's going</font>

103
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,670
to say what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hell you're not a monkey</font>

104
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,950
or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> geo but then as soon as you do</font>

105
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,480
that then the fantasies gone and no

106
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,630
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> can we play the improv game so um</font>

107
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,640
in the beginning I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a really hard</font>

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,670
time while with the improv cuz i guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

109
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,320
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this about myself but I'm a</font>

110
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,440
very controlling a structured person and

111
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,478
if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an organization in my life</font>

112
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,298
then I panic and I tried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I try to</font>

113
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,820
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization there and in with</font>

114
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,400
improv um check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sweater that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

115
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,240
got just on a side note it says<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,700
don't think and it's an official UCB

117
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,890
sweater I can't show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the back so I'm</font>

118
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously driving but that's basically</font>

119
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:37,900
the model of

120
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,169
UCB<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's don't think just play so</font>

121
00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:44,599
because I was constantly thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of oh</font>

122
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,550
my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to be funny what am I</font>

123
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,039
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say I'm not created enough like</font>

124
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,599
what am<font color="#CCCCCC"> I going to do to drive this</font>

125
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:53,090
story it's like I already messed up the

126
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,090
scene so um I had to learn a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about</font>

127
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,830
myself and in working with

128
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,250
justkiddingfilms I really need to learn

129
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,340
to not think so much so I find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

130
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,720
looking in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the camera I'm just trying</font>

131
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,949
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to die hence why i'm also wearing</font>

132
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:11,569
glasses so that I don't have to stare

133
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:13,610
right into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera just a little</font>

134
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,909
trick but um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so in the</font>

135
00:05:16,909 --> 00:05:18,229
beginning I was having a very hard time

136
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:19,759
because I was just thinking way too much

137
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,680
I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the</font>

138
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,210
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the story and the</font>

139
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle of the story and I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

140
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,569
okay this person says is how am I gonna

141
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:29,810
react but we don't know what each other

142
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:31,490
is thinking or how we're going to view

143
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,130
the story because I might be pretending

144
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,300
like I'm sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chair but the</font>

145
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,430
other person might see it as me sitting

146
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,289
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rock and as soon as they start</font>

147
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:40,639
saying that I'm sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rock then</font>

148
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,219
my story in my had changed so i have to

149
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:46,190
go along with what they're saying so um

150
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,020
it was a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun I got to meet</font>

151
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,370
fabulous talented amazing people along

152
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,050
the way there were just people there

153
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,250
that we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over stage</font>
