5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">three exercises that everyone refers to</font>

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:18,330
when they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

7

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,960
are your quadriceps it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also hits your</font>

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,289
glutes your hip abductors<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

11
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:34,200
calves I was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> wearing makeup</font>

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,390
this time in this video because this is

13
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,640
the actual video that we shot for our

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,040
barbell<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brigade promo and our update</font>

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,660
video that's why I'm actually even

16
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,570
working out with my hair down which was

17
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,120
so annoying so that's why you see here

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,340
it's up in a ponytail now and I never

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,100
dressed this<font color="#E5E5E5"> skimpy cuz that bar fucking</font>

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,590
hurts on my back and moving on to bench

21
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,840
press which targets your pectoral

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,850
muscles and for ladies that means your

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,070
boobies so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

24
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,309
boobies to get a lot smaller then you

25
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:07,140
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more of an incline</font>

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">bench it also hits your front delts and</font>

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,450
your triceps and people believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

28
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,280
these exercises truly measure your

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,770
strength because they are all compound

30
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,869
movements which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

31
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,200
involving two or more body part this was

32
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,490
actually the first time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able</font>

33
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:30,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do one full rep by myself at 95 on</font>

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bench press and this is actually my</font>

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,520
bench press<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup I just kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like</font>

36
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,950
push myself back and then pull forward I

37
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,299
have heard that that lives are

38
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:47,729
considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the most impressive out</font>

39
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,250
of all the three because it involves

40
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,369
explosive strength and overall power so

41
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:55,229
that just means that you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

42
