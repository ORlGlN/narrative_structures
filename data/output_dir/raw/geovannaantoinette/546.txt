00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,069
hey whats up beautiful people so today

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,980
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a beautiful day in LA well it's a</font>

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,410
semi beautiful day um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> washed my car</font>

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,670
yesterday which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a rarity and today</font>

5
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,430
ironically enough um it's raining I

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,770
opened up the workout today with five by

7
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,930
five at my eighty percent felt pretty

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,720
good I moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to ninety to ninety</font>

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,650
pounds and I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of cold but</font>

10
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,689
I was like screw it I'm gonna do it it's

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,070
all a little too crazy I didn't have a

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,930
spotter I didn't have confidence myself

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,910
I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I think I'm doing them move it</font>

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,190
down to 85 the more I got warmed up the

15
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,500
more 85 felt lighter and lighter so I

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,450
know next week to open up at 85 and

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,750
eventually end that workout at 90 pounds

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,420
and then I moved it to my leg off the

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,460
bench which always trips me the hell out

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,590
because I always feel like leg Drive you

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,239
need leg Drive you lead a leg drop<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz</font>

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,219
it's a full body movement your arms are

23
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,510
just there to hold it the weight so

24
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,590
that's what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking right so i</font>

25
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,750
stood<font color="#CCCCCC"> it put my legs up I no longer use</font>

26
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,319
leg Drive and I'm like relatively the

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,510
same strength as when my legs are done

28
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,670
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really odd because usually legs</font>

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,159
help you more so at least it gives you

30
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,400
like a 10 to 20 pound increase on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we</font>

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,640
like honestly it does um but it strange

32
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,930
that even with my legs up i'm still

33
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,180
relatively strong so that just goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

34
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,250
show you my bench it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fucking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks and</font>

35
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,189
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i moved into 10 by 10 an incline</font>

36
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,290
bench that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on my chest</font>

37
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,960
muscles and sadly it's what we gonna get

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of my boobs fat but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay because who needs boobs</font>

40
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,400
but did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> send by time with a minute</font>

41
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,400
rest got the blood flowing and it's that

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,660
was enough for was like hey you know

43
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">what let's do lap pool down 10 by 10</font>

44
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,190
again with one minute rest screw<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you</font>

45
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:49,190

46
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty crazy which it feels kind of</font>

47
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,310
good i really enjoyed volume because it

48
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,860
like it helps me feel what muscle<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

49
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:57,380
working out and it also helps me feel my

50
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,260
form so honestly even though it's a

51
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,930
slight cardio I really do enjoy a high

52
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,060
volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it better feel</font>

53
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,979
and understanding<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my body and then</font>

54
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,610
I moved into 21 which is seven halfway

55
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seven another half way up and then</font>

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,310
another seven the full range of motion

57
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,560
did that for three sets and that

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,970
seriously got the blood flowing gave you

59
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,430

60
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,930
like I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> rip my sweater if I flex</font>

61
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,490
