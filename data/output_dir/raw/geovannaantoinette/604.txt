4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,580
most loaded exercises just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm</font>

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,460
so weak and I'm so full of myself that I

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">always like to see me moving a lot more</font>

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,850
weight but my ego is always checked at

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,830
the door once I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lift up higher</font>

9
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,199
weight I'm here I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just constantly</font>

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,630
tweaking my grip this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just neutral</font>

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,900
grip um here you will see me switch over

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,239
to narrow grip which I realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot</font>

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see I get to</font>

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,320
move the weights a lot quicker with

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,340
narrow grip so I'm gonna start

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,600
implementing that I didn't realize that

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,070
until I started watching this video

18
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,059

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,230
just my main lip just like the accessory

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,760
work that I did for the close grip bench

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,920
I am doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more accessory working</font>

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,809
specifically to target my shoulders

24
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,370
because it's gonna help when I'm trying

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lose weight bench but I've been doing</font>
