00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,290
it's definitely definitely not the last

48
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,960
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you guys see me all rapping or</font>

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,630
doing anything with music but no I know

50
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,930
a question from in this misery reads

51
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,930
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you and Bart me and what did</font>

52
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">you guys decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move in together</font>

53
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:22,860
jolivar deny event back in 2004 and

54
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,780
actually decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move him in with me</font>

55
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,220
where I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> living at the time first</font>

56
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,040
because he had just graduated from<font color="#E5E5E5"> UCLA</font>

57
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,620
and at that time he was the being out

58
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,830
there for school so the rent was really

59
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,970
really expensive and it really wasn't

60
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,430
worth him paying the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rent that</font>

61
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,230
he was to live there when he no longer

62
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:44,050
attended that school so instead of

63
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,370
looking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

64
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good deal on he he had asked me</font>

65
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:50,470
fine you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any places and at that</font>

66
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,810
moment one of the three girls<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was</font>

67
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">living with had to move up so there was</font>

68
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,980
a vacant room and I asked him you know

69
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,070
what um I live in a house with you know

70
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,620
two other females and we're really

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,080
really clean you know we're girls you

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,510
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how comfortable you</font>

73
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,239

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,820
can totally invent so that's what had

75
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,430
happened on he decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the offer</font>

76
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,700
he moved in so it was it was us three

77
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,340
girls and him we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> had our own room it</font>

78
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it was pretty cool but then him and</font>

79

<font color="#CCCCCC">I would always stay up working on JK</font>

80
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,739
stuff and our<font color="#E5E5E5"> own rooms became really</font>

81
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,530
small to hold you know merge you know

82
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,290
meetings with clients and stuff so we

83
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,299
decided that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing was for us</font>

84
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:40,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to just move in together um save on rent</font>

85
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,190
save on everything split everything down

86
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,140
the middle and we still had a

87
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable place to hold our meetings</font>

88
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,010
or to be loud or to be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> late at</font>

89
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,019
night<font color="#E5E5E5"> without really interrupting</font>

of it next comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> end question punch</font>

103
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:30,170
from Sparta k PG oh I was wondering what

104
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,610
was your experience like studying

105
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,250
marketing I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to university</font>

106
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,400
next year and like you I was torn

107
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,500
between my creative side and my logical

108
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,990
side I am extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in visual</font>

109
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,060
arts such as photography graphic design

110
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,610
and videography but I decided to scrap

111
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,590
those admissions for a safer career in

112
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,600
business more specifically I hope

113
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,910
marketing also are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you glad to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

114
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:55,790
chosen business over art<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so my</font>

115
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,090
experience in marketing was a great one

116
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,050
because I am creative like yourself but

117
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,260
i really really really<font color="#CCCCCC"> enjoy business</font>

120
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,340
enjoy the strategizing the planning you

121
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the structure so for the kind of</font>

122
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,160
person that I am Mia picking business

123
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">over art was just super easy and it was</font>

124
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,320
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the best decision that I I could</font>

125
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,500
have made um<font color="#E5E5E5"> because now I have the</font>

126
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,650
structure I have the the tools so that

127
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,510
when i do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pursue my creative</font>

128
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:35,360
side um I can put it out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I can</font>

130
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,760
work to in front of an audience um but

131
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,850
if I was super good let's say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

132
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">photography or graphic design or</font>

133
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,710
videography then maybe my answer would

134
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,210
be different and I would say hey you

135
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,010
know what I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picked art /</font>

136
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,230
business because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're</font>

137
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,830
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at something and and you're</font>

138
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">passionate about it then I think that</font>

139
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,230
you should make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your career and</font>

140
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,820
there are people that say you know what

141
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,320
you shouldn't make what you love your

142
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,250
job but for me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the opposite I feel</font>

143
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,919
if you are doing what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love then it's</font>
