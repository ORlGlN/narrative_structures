you you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> the man we have a very first</font>

40
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:40,530
question coming from whiter ice is nice

41
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,799
and they have to ask are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and Bart</font>

42
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:48,960
going out sorry it's all caps I'm really

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,659
amazed at how many people really want to

44
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,490
know this answer I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's funny</font>

45
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,520
because you guys always like try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,899
little detectives and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys try to</font>

47
00:01:57,899 --> 00:01:59,340
like piece together all this information

48
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,130
like ooh they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Taiwan together no</font>

49
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,320
no no no but wait they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> two separate</font>

50
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,960
beds so they can be going up no but the

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,220
art going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because they went hiking</font>

52
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,869
together like they're always together

53
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,000
reason why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are always together is</font>

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,170
because um Joe right now has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> full-time</font>

55
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">job so you can't really make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out to a</font>

56
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,920
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we do because</font>

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,200
while we're going on a hike you know

58
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,519
taking some time off Joe is at work away

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,640
from JK so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason why but you</font>

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,730
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around a lot more so look</font>

61
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing me more with Joe or</font>

62
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,450
get get ready to see Bart and Joe

63
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,370
together more so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

64
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,810
you guys always see us together<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,410
question comes from oh yeah and they say

66
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,160
are you Asian<font color="#CCCCCC"> or Mexican aha I don't</font>

67
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,400
really know what aha is there for anyway

68
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,049
ah mi Asian or Mexican let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

69
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,720
that I am mixed with a little bit of

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,359
everything you name it and I am mixed

71
00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:06,659
with it the reason why i like to say

72
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:08,280
that I am mixed with everything is

73
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,909
because I don't like to just say that I

74
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:15,900
am one specific ethnicity because I feel

75
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,650
very passionate<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all different</font>

76
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:22,410
races all different ethnicities so I

77
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,359
really like to associate associate

78
00:03:24,359 --> 00:03:26,190
myself with all of them and I like to

79
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,859
appreciate all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them so for that</font>

80
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,879
reason I am either whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want me</font>

81
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,919
to be or i'm a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything</font>

82
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,290
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever meet me in person and you</font>

83
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,180
ask me guess what i'm going to say I'm a

84
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,769
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything I understand</font>

85
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,660
why people ask that question you know

86
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,949
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a nice break or</font>

87
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,780
other times it's just to see if we have

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,329
something in common you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we try to</font>

89
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,340
relate and connect with<font color="#E5E5E5"> each other I get</font>

90
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,720
it but let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> play a game and the</font>

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,419
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you need someone just forget</font>

92
00:03:57,419 --> 00:03:59,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there anything and just try to</font>

93
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,220
figure them out as a person and I bet

94
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,500
you their ethnicity is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

95
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,660
matter at all I hope answered that

96
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,220
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a bit of everything</font>

97
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,650
next question comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue inferno</font>

98
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,889
and they say I wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could be on just</font>

99
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,589
kidding films but it's only a dream

100
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,140
actually no it's not a dream so when we

101
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,660
first started I put out an email

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,520
saying that we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin a street</font>

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,560
team and a street team is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a group</font>

104
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,660
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that will pass out flyers to</font>

105
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,770

00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,160
than others but that is no means of like

137
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,570
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that you guys</font>

really got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you know their</font>

195

business model I really got to

<font color="#E5E5E5">understand um what they were all about</font>

197
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,350
through just kidding films and the

198
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:26,400
message that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to put out</font>

199
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,500
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the youth specially and I was</font>

200
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,260
really really moved by it and out I saw

201
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,820
my opportunity to to put my marketing um

202
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,409
the things I learned in marketing into

203
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,969
play so slowly and<font color="#CCCCCC"> share</font>

204
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,399
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like integrated into the</font>

205
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,279
business and I became you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a member</font>

206
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,579
of just kidding films and because we're

207
00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:51,610
so short-handed with bodies and hands

208
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,550
and people to be behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scenes and</font>

209
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,769
in front of the camera that a lot of the

210
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,350
times I was forced<font color="#E5E5E5"> into these skits for</font>

211
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,089
example the one I did with DeLaGhetto

212
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:04,629
right I was there just as extra hands

213
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:06,189
just to see if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed someone for</font>

214
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:08,079
lighting or just someone to run and get

215
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,000
different things for them but they're

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,379
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> geo guess what you're going to be</font>

217
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:13,389
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I'm like what the hell like</font>

218
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:15,790
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be this like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font>

219
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be behind the scenes like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

220
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how to I don't even know how to act</font>

221
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:20,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that's like you see this video even</font>

222
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:21,910
now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how to act but whatever</font>

223
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,610
I care less now but I was so nervous and

224
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,990
I'm like am i standing in the right

225
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,899
place like do I look okay like like I

226
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,269
was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> remember things to say and</font>

227
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:33,300
even though I had like one line whatever

228
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,089
but yeah the<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um slowly I was thrown</font>

229
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,000
into it and I've been learning a lot so

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,120
um I've been more confident with being

231
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,600
on camera so now I guess I'm just a

232
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,519
regular in their skits um and yeah I

233
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,990
