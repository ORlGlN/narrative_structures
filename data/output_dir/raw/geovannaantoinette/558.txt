38
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,930
basically playing agent Ellis where

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,130
you're like this detective you get all

40
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,680
these clues and you have to solve the

41
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,840
mystery of who kidnapped this particular

42
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,220
actress so as you can see I've already

43
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,049
been playing it's quite addicting and

44
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:42,689
it's think of it as like um you're

45
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,950
searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> for clues but they tell you</font>

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,630
what to look for so you're like you're

47
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,820
