00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,440
does this mean so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line is</font>

23
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,210
started off as a comedian moving into

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,489
the rapping game and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a line that</font>

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:09,570
is said by bar um and he's just his

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,150
character is one that just likes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

27
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">just try different things try anything</font>

28
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,540
sports of that person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just dives</font>

29
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,970
into things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> he feels pretty</font>

30
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,210
comfortable with comedy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know he</font>

31
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,729
wants to brought in his own horizon and

32
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:26,369
he wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see what you know what</font>

33
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:27,900
rapping is like because he grew up

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">really enjoying music he plays the drums</font>

35
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,150
if he haven't really been following up

36
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,210
with his vlogs um yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he loves to</font>

37
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,210
sing so he said you know let's rap

38
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,100
because he's apparently a very

39
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,659
aggressive person because he loves to

40
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:46,439
fight so um rapaz<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess a way where he</font>

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,840
can channel that I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,860
energy and um and really express himself

43
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:55,170
so yeah um that's what that line mean so

44
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,750
he started off as a comedian and now he

45
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,750
