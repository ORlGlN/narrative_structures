00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,540
different breeds and it's a great place

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,090
for your dogs to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> very socialized</font>

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,610
and also if their indoor dogs like mine

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,840
unfortunately are they get a lot of

21
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,759
exercise and this works just really cool

22
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,410
because as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see there's like a</font>

23
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,539
lot of grass there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of running</font>
