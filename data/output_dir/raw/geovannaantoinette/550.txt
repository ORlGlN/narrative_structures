38
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,500
stick to very happy the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> beautiful</font>

39
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,350
simple straightforward games um like

40
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,479
touch his<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one and the second game</font>

41
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:28,979
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm actually getting really into is</font>

42
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:31,829
this super cool like mystery game that's

43
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,380
like centered in the 1930s which is by

44
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:37,500
far my favorite era of all time in terms

45
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,990
of fashion um and it's called pearls

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,060
peril and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

47
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,439
mystery game where you have to unlock

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,869
all these different clues to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the</font>

49
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,360
next level and you the basic premise of

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is to discover who killed pearls dad</font>

51
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,140
because he just mysteriously disappeared

52
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,670
right so there's different levels like

53
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,909
um someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> threw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a paper in the trash</font>

54
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:01,920
and they shredded it so then you have to

55
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,750
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> paper get it and then you put</font>

56
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pieces altogether and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

57
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,110
like a clue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to advance to the</font>

58
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,330
next level another one is you play this

59
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,090
on calm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use another coin so you</font>

60
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,570
play this game here right and it tells

61
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,160
you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for and these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

62
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,410
sort of clues that you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> collect</font>

63
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,080
um in order to advance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next level</font>

64
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,880
so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here it's saying a</font>

65
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,830
coin viewer right so a coin beer would

66
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,330
be there and you think it's actually

67
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty simple but they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do a</font>

68
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,360
really good job of hiding certain things

69
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,170
because certain things will be like

70
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">missing a painting and if you're like</font>

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,410
staring<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it you're like oh what the</font>

72
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,900
heck support is this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

graphics obviously and two is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're</font>

75
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,970
like constantly searching<font color="#CCCCCC"> for clues so</font>

76
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,900
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

77
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,480
