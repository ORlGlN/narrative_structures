21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,188
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> busy doing that and something</font>

22
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:07,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been working on or our most</font>

23
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest project has been t-shirts for you</font>

24
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
guys um for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,040
we have currently we have three shirt

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,490
designs out so it's uncle punch

27
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:20,610
underwear model and big shit so we've

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,950
those have been on in circulation for a

29
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,560
while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and it's I think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,780
time what you guys think it's about time

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,110
that we have a new shirt design yes so

32
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,509
that's what I've been working on um and

33
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,040
the process isn't the easiest cuz uh

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,869
what happens is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

35
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,350
design first right so once you finally

36
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,350
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the design you need to get that</font>

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,799
vectorized and pretty much it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

38
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,009
digital file of your design so let's say

39
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:55,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">you sketch draw something then they</font>

40
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,840
can't they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> move that directly</font>

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,140
from your pencil and paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then put</font>

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,000
it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a t-shirt what happens is they</font>

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,409
have to digitalize the file pretty much

44
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:08,580
and then then they can do the whole soap

45
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,019
screening and all the printing and all

46
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,349
that so the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did for</font>

47
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:17,700
example is we put the design together on

48
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,290
Photoshop right from Photoshop then I

49
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,549
give it to someone else<font color="#CCCCCC"> because i have</font>

50
00:02:21,549 --> 00:02:23,620
no idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to work illustrator so i</font>

51
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,989
give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a graphic designer that works</font>

52
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,560
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> adobe illustrator they vectorize the</font>

53
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,319
file and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i find somebody</font>

54
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,390
that does printing so in the printing

55
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,250
it's just not you know finding any

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,799
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe and then um saying hey you</font>

57
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:40,629
know what I have this is this design

58
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,110
printed know there's a particular shirt

59
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,450
quality that we want so we want it

60
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,470
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> thin we want it ought to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

61
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,349
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it not only that now</font>

62
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,959
I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual ink that</font>

63
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,489
we're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> printing on there's</font>

64
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,810
different types of inks there's a

65
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,819
discharge there's water based there's

66
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,440
plastisol there's so many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,450
types of ink so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

68
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">something more light</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and thin just so</font>

69
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:08,769
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's comfortable to wear because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

70
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,019
know when I wear a t-shirt I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

71
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,459
wear the ones that are like the oldest

72
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,810
because that's like when the cotton is

73
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,980
the softest for me at least so i had to

74
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,620
find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> person that um had the particular</font>

75
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,370
ink and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i also sold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shirts together</font>

76
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,440
with um for what I wanted um and then

77
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,169
from then from there at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

78
00:03:32,169 --> 00:03:33,489
like get all the measurements at as far

79
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you know where i want it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be placed</font>

80
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,810
how many inches from the color how many

81
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,910
inches from the bottom how big i want

82
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,400
the font to be um just the whole

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,930
placement of the design if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted</font>

84
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,430
off-centered if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want it centered if i</font>

86
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,870

137
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,810
fun to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just create something out of</font>

138
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:48,960
nowhere so pretty much we created

139
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,560
something from just a simple idea and

140
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,330
the end result is going to be a tangible

141
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,339
product so that's always exciting to me

142
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:58,500

take on more projects and and have it

145
00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:07,889
start from air to have that tangible

146
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,800
something at the end so yeah that's

147
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
