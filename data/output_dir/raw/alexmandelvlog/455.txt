37
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,670
TV here and everything but it doesn't

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,480
send through any audio or video like the

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,720
ps3<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the lights go on and when it</font>

40
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,390
first turns on you can hear it in the

41
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,180
speakers of the TV like<font color="#E5E5E5"> startup I don't</font>

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,280
mean any any audio just like a just like

43
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,780
a pop like it's at least there and then

44
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,270
no audio no visual I think it's just

45
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,600
dead it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really unfortunate maybe I</font>

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,440
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just return those controllers</font>

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,730

55
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,049
online says vacuumed events because

56
00:03:11,049 --> 00:03:13,299

57
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought that was crazy but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like</font>

58
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try it because i wanted</font>
