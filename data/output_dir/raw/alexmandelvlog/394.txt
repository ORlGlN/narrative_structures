on Catalina you can't get service it's

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,100
like it's so slow it takes like

51
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,420
seriously<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 seconds to load a page</font>

52
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,150
imagine trying to upload an HD video so

53
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:57,230
i paid for Wi-Fi the Wi-Fi is slower

54
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,480
than the regular service so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i paid</font>

55
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,350
for a plan to move it onto my ipad and

56
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,050
use the 4g on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my ipad so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

57
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,300
upload on my ipad just using the 4g and

58
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,430
paying for service for that I'm doing

59
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I can but just letting you know</font>
