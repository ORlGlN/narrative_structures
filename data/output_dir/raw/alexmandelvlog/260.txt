<font color="#E5E5E5">different liquors that it's so it's</font>

118
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,180
interesting to try new things so here's

119
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,010
i'll give you that well here I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> shall</font>

120
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,560
make mine real quick so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll make mine</font>

121
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,140
kind of like the now uh and I got it I'm

122
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,570
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> masterful at one hand usage just</font>

123
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:55,510
so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh I know I so it</font>

124
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,840
has it calls for 1.5 ounces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tijuana</font>

125
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,700
sweet heat now I decided to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

126
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,410
which is technically about 1.6 1.7 1.7

127
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,480
ounces but that's fine because I'm

128
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,070
feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> frisky so as I saw the website</font>

129
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,850
they also used a giant cube of ice so

130
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,800
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the correct way to do it so</font>

131
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,220
let's add the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tijuana sweetie calls for</font>

132
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,470
one ounce of orange juice now an orange

133
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,780
typically has about two ounces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of juice</font>

134
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,260
for one large orange so I've already cut

135
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,080
it in half<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to take this place</font>

136
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,460
it in my press now do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold</font>

137
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,410
this this I cannot do<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-handed so</font>

138
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,520
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead</font>

139
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:49,400
squeeze this oh excuse you please don't

140
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,879
refresh it actually didn't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

141
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,030
call that an ounce let's do a little bit

142
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:59,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">more just a little how to use the whole</font>

143
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:11,150
thing well Harvey's oh my god<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

144
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,569
take this and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add two</font>

145
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,430
ounces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cranberry juice so put those</font>

146
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:30,169
two right here holy whoa someone's

147
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,219
excited about g 1 a 3 and then a half

148
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:42,200
ounce of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lime juice perfect add that now</font>

149
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
pro tip right here any drink that has

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,060
orange juice in it needs to be stirred

151
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,550
even if it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> built drink it has orange</font>

152
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:57,260
juice it needs to be stirred so now Jake

153
