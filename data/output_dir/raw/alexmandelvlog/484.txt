uploading vlogs it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really an</font>

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,870
option of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that cruise because we</font>

80
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,820
have days we have like a day at sea and

81
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,530
everything that the internet on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship</font>

82
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,389
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if any of you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

83
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:38,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">been on a cruise ship and if you have</font>

84
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,330
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about it is</font>

85
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,470
super super just a load a web site is

86
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:48,280
like 10 seconds and that's that's the

87
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,229
download speed upload speed is way

88
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:53,050
slower and you have to pay by the minute

89
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,080
and they don't have I checked on

90
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,789
unlimited Wi-Fi rate if they did I let

91
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,560
it upload for<font color="#E5E5E5"> however lot doesn't matter</font>

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,810
but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have that so I gotta pay</font>

93
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,770
by the minute which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 99 cents a</font>

94
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,300
minute our side of that and it would

95
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,520
probably take me at least six to eight

96
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,669
hours to upload so that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

97
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:19,539
most expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlog I have ever done if</font>

98
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,210
I start uploading vlogs on the ship that

99
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,030
being said i<font color="#CCCCCC"> am going to vlog every day</font>

100
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,789

103
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:35,169
different so when i get back i get back
