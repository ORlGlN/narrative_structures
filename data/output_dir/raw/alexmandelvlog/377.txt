those like heavy-duty few locks and my

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,470

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,000
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good enough luck whatever</font>

19

this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my bike it's definitely but the</font>

24
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,479
problem is is if I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

25
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,710
the cake like I'm sure it's not the guy

26
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,820
who stole I'm sure you bought it like

27
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,950
I'll craigslist or from someone but if I

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,740
said I'm like hey where'd you get it and

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,229

no way of grouping that's my bike

33
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:33,219
visually and almost I'm like let's just

34
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,780
walk away like there's no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can even</font>

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">prove that that's my butt but I think</font>

36
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,420
strong chance

37
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,250
