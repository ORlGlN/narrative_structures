8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,140
that don't know he works for a

9
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,940
skateboard real company called shark

10
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,910
wheel which pretty much as they claim as

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,620
well reinvented the wheel and a shark

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,039
wheels so we'll open them and I'll show

13
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,440
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you why they're so special</font>

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,890
and awesome so if you notice let it

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,570
lighten up they look square and that's

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of square but I</font>

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,349
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds really weird and</font>

18
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,000
ridiculous like that's stupid why would

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,520
you make square wheels that's what they

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">are but the technology in these is</font>

21
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,540
amazing it's brand new so if you guys

22
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,430
know those snakes that go through the

23
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,220
desert like the Sidewinders they go like

24
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,420
this they like move in a zigzag<font color="#E5E5E5"> foot</font>

25
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,520
formation that's what these do that's

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,380
what are for now is called keep what if

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,119
that's what our formulas<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold Oh</font>

28
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sidewinder formula did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eirias a</font>

29
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">sidewinder</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the snake that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is their exact</font>

30
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,549
thing so these wheels they do that

31
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,369
rather than roll straight now you saw

32
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,920
there pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> square but if you roll</font>

33
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,450
them because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,090
see they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually role perfectly round</font>

35
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,530
and it'll keep rolling

36
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,210
and then the real application for them

37
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,610
is any bumps in the road or any if you

38
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">go over stand I don't know how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

39
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys skateboard but if you do you</font>

40
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,710
know that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you hit a little patches in</font>

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,210
your board is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to pretty much</font>

42
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,060
stopped or slowed down significantly

43
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,750
lose speed or traction these will cut

44
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,970
through it so when I'm skateboarding

45
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,220
next to him and he and I hit bumps to

46
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,170
the road and<font color="#CCCCCC"> slow down his just goes</font>

47
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,180
straight through them it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just takes it</font>

48
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,440
like nothing else we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to put it</font>

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,060
on my board<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll and I'll show you</font>

50
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,790
guys a cool example look good only got

51
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,530
one more to go Jake's changing out the

52
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,430
last one I'm actually excited to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:39,690
this on my board last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one yeah those</font>

54
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,020
does

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,300
nice since these wheels are clean right

56
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,640
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ooh pump it into everything</font>

57
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">ooh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my parents are gonna kill me they're</font>

58
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,220
clean wheels I'm just trying them and

59
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,010
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was super smooth an awesome I had</font>

60
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,140
to do that just once for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

61
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,910
that ride your skateboard if you hit

62
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,590
like a little rock or something and

63
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,930
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going that fast you're bored</font>

64
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:24,670
just stops and I fallen on to flat on my

65
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,160
chest before<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that but anyway so</font>

66
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,920
look at these these are all like things

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that fall off the tree they're not</font>

68
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,910
squishy they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to like big</font>

69
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,320
pebbles and if you if you ride a normal

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,720

pretty slow so they can see they just

74
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,910
like the design makes them like fly out

75
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,010

76
