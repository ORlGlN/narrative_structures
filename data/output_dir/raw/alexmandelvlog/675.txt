00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,080
hey guys so one thing I haven't told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,130
is that I have I'm starting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new job</font>

3
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,359
today now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't actually tell you what</font>

4
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,449
the job is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> for confidentiality</font>

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,900
reasons which is the same with most

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,480
entertainment jobs but I can tell you

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,490
that one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I do is I'm I</font>

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,488
also produce I'm a producer as well so

9
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:34,680
that's kind of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> realm of what I'm</font>

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,940
doing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now for the next five weeks</font>

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,910
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a monday through friday job</font>

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,989
sometimes we shoot weekend sometimes

13
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,800
whatever anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,940
guys know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys are</font>

15
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,789
gonna start wondering why aren't you

16
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,440
shooting during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day cuz I'm not</font>

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,780
allowed to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoot the stuff that</font>

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:57,030
we're doing during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day because it's</font>

19
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,750
confidential so uh you'll see a lot of

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,969
like morning stuff on the way there I

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,979
guess maybe lunchtime and then

22
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,689
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> after work i'll be vlogging</font>

23
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:08,580
then that'll be normal vlogging and you

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,710
guys may not even realize the difference

25
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,170
