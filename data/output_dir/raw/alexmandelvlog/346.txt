seen in past blogs that we have flown

your own personal jet it is not they are

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,910

40
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">plant a commercial might not but there</font>

41
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,330

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,810
he goes it back and forth between

46
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,319
commercial flying and private chartering

47
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,049
