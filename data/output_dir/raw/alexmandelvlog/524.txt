jello shots in these awesome little mini

92
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,370
red<font color="#CCCCCC"> conference yeah jolly rancher jello</font>

93
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,039
shots and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you guys</font>

94
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,599
a really cool trick<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if you're gonna</font>

95
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:38,090
make jello shots and let's say you have

96
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,070
like where's watermelon so if you have

97
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:43,479
watermelon jello a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people make</font>

98
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,310
jello shots and they put vodka in it and

99
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,599
that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they'll be pretty</font>

100
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:49,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong and people if you're going to</font>

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,259
have a jello shot chain starts because

102
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,120
you want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> taste sweet and good so</font>

103
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,419
if you get watermelon jello like jello

104
00:04:56,419 --> 00:05:02,139
mix then you want to use corresponding

105
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,330
watermelon vodka now if you're making

106
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,500
jello shots it doesn't have to be the

107
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,750
best vodka use whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want so you</font>

108
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to try to find like the</font>

109
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,289
corresponding flavor so that when you

110
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:14,000
have the jello shot it just tastes sweet

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,229
and you don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much alcohol</font>
