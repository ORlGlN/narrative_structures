from that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show you guys</font>

28
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,440
sometimes when people recognize my dad

29
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,000
it could be a little bit dangerous this

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,310
guy was<font color="#E5E5E5"> come by an escape board wanted</font>

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,920
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hi to my dad you need to see how</font>

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">almost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got hit by the car it is just</font>

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:44,369
just watch I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that</font>

35
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:46,769
that guy was about to get hit I have no

36
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he jumped off so fast and</font>

37
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,399
didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't even touch the car</font>

38
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,629
he didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even touch it but it's a hook</font>

39
00:01:54,629 --> 00:01:57,119
this crazy so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that happens a</font>

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,379
lot in santa monica when I ride my

41
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,170
booster board I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ride on the</font>

42
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">street obviously right like in the bike</font>

43
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,860
lane I don't ride on the sidewalks

44
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,800
because our alleyways never have like

45
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,030
they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a mirror up or</font>

46
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,550
anything to tell you or so you could see

47
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,890
like who's walking across or what's

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,989
going on so it's scary to ride a

49
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">skateboard or to do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

50
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,950
you're going fast and you can't stop for

51
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,140
like or look around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> corner because</font>

52
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,180
cars do just fly out so that way they

53
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,200
could see what's in the street they

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,250
shouldn't be they<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be stunned</font>

55
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,799
first to see if there's someone on the

56
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:32,970
sidewalk but it can get pretty scary

57
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,420
what he's gonna go again

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,060
