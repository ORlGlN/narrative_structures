55
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">the store that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we went to and what I got</font>

56
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,510
was myself a crystal decanter here this

57
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,400
will have the tequila inside it's just

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,360
nicer store Nick tequila in a decanter

59
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,560
to believe but like bourbon over that

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,990
worsens or whiskey but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it'd be</font>

61
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">nicer than just having like a regular</font>

62
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,220
liquor bottle than to have like those

63
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,900
out there and everything and I also got

64
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,269
these which are stickers but these are

65
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,600
actually little sticker chalkboards so I

66
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,000
can put those on and I have a chalk

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
marker rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> and chalk and so it'll be</font>

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,550
cool to put the label if I don't know if

69
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,320
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick them directly on here</font>

70
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,360
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has these label these things</font>

71
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,250
protruding so it might just make like a

72
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,989
wire<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes around here and hangs</font>

73
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,750
them for that I figure out how I'm going

74
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,450
to do that but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do you want to</font>

75
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,280
write tequila for it for this one this

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,580
decanter

77
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,020
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of doing that</font>

78
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,630
you mean like like a hemp type of thing

79
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,460
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that but I</font>

80
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,530
rather than buying any buying more stuff

81
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,600
i have like thick wire<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could just use</font>

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,670
black wire it might look cool because

83
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,350
it'll go with the base to the bases

84
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,110
black metal I don't know we're figuring

85
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,470
