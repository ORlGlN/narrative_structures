298
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:41,250
styrofoam is not meant to be superheated

299
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,640

352
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,860
know that most the time you go to the

353
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,389
hospital and you go to the emergency

354
00:22:09,389 --> 00:22:11,009
room they don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's an</font>

355
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:13,649
emergency and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wait for an hour in</font>

356
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:14,909
the waiting room will guess what I

357
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:16,649
didn't realize how dangerous burns word

358
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:18,480
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they looked at it they were like</font>

359
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,669
right now I was like what there's people

360
00:22:20,669 --> 00:22:22,710
they go no you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come in right now</font>

361
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,509
apparently if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you burn yourself really</font>

362
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad you are susceptible to like terrible</font>

363
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,720
infection right away so they brought me

364
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,879
in and they gave me painkillers not down

365
00:22:32,879 --> 00:22:34,649
here not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in where there any painkillers</font>

366
00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:37,139
in my shoulder and then if you ever seen

367
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,429
a movie when they take like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a needle</font>

368
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:40,470
they do that they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

369
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it goes into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your muscle so this</font>

370
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:44,840
little nurse comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in a boom and I'm</font>

371
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,789
good she goes I know it's painful right

372
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:49,379
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that's painful you just stabbed</font>

373
00:22:49,379 --> 00:22:52,350
me in the arm so she stabbed me here

374
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,080
with the painkiller and first one she

375
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,970
said was gonna be a really strong

376
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,350
painkiller but it was gonna make<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

377
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,090
nauseous so she gave me<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one to</font>

378
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:04,139
counter the nausea anyway then this is

379
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:07,619
all from from double noodles so I'm

380
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:09,450
sitting there with my burn they laid me

381
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,730
down and the doctor says we need to cut

382
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,440
off all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dead skin so that it's not</font>

383
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,019
does it go back but he cuts off that

384
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,700
skin I don't feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because it's</font>

385
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">there then he says the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next thing I have</font>

386
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,070
to do is I need I need you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> squeeze</font>

387
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,429
inside of the bed because this is going

388
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:30,659
to be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> painful and I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

389
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,100
what are you gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's going</font>

390
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be really painful I need you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hold</font>

391
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,029
on you said I need to take the forceps

392
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:40,470
and I need to peel up a few millimeters

393
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">of your skin that's still alive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and cut</font>

394
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,019
into that cut around the perimeter that

395
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:47,670
to make sure I

396
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,500
all the dead skin and he said because

397
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,720
it's living you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will feel all what you</font>

398
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,990
have to cut my live skin and let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

399
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">you from all the pain medication I</font>

400
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,190
didn't care because I was high as a kite

401
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:13,950
but it was painful as tricking hell so

402
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:16,800
they cleaned that and then they made it

403
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,750
they made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it better now like I'm after</font>

404
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">wearing the burn sleeve but the</font>

405
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,840
Bernstein action doesn't has a fix it

406
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,360
has fake skin the inside the burn sleeve

407
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,730
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fake skate tricks your body into</font>

408
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,720
thinking that it's healed and scar

409
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,360
tissue when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get hurt scar tissue is</font>

410
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,270
a buildup of extra tissue to protect the

411
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:39,390
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's damaged if your body thinks</font>

412
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,130
it's already healed it will just grow

413
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,990
back regular skin the guy who invented

414
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,870
it is the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> who gave you that sleep</font>

415
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:47,490
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just grow back regular skin not</font>

416
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,350
trying to overcompensate because it

417
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,630
thinks it's already healed tricks your

418
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:54,750
body so as you can see here i'll try to

419
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,260
show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know how good it so you</font>

dad had an extra bone that was made my

804
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,480
ribs a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot on my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right side</font>

805
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,280
it still is hard to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> with my black</font>

806
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,200
shirt anyway my ribs are a little bit

807
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,960
higher on one side and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no big</font>

808
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,220
deal but I asked my dad what<font color="#CCCCCC"> was wrong</font>

809
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">with me and any time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he has a an</font>

810
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,630
opportunity to screw with me or to make

811
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:14,320
a joke<font color="#E5E5E5"> he will do it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what he did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

812
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">he told me i was in fifth grade and he</font>

813
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,660
told me that what it's called what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

814
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:24,940
have is i have a boner in my chest<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I</font>

815
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,890
was an immature<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5th grader so I laughed</font>

816
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he stayed completely serious and he</font>

817
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:31,420
goes non serious and I said what do you

818
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,020
mean I'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> vulgar images and he said he</font>

819
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:36,580
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no the reason why you're</font>

820
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:38,740
thinking of that Boehner he goes into

821
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">what a boner is is when you have a bone</font>

822
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:43,240
and an extra growth off of the bone

823
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,640
that's like the earth it's like a bone

824
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,610
earth so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came from he's</font>

825
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:49,990
like that's why they call that that

826
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:51,940
because it's like a growth extension so

827
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,560
it was like but the real meaning of it

828
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,140
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have is an actual medical</font>

829
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,720
phone and I was like oh and that was a

830
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,760
totally legitimate thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

831
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,040
right it's a protrusion op follow anyway

832
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:08,080
so I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I had a boner in my</font>

833
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,720
chest my<font color="#CCCCCC"> dad said I was like so what</font>

834
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,520
should i do which I tell the school or

835
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:14,770
what do I like what about PE I have to

836
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,190
do fit like you know gym class and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

837
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:20,170
goes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shouldn't do that and</font>

838
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,050
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he walked away and new totally most</font>

839
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,000
the time that he jokes he doesn't even

840
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,550
reveal he just forgets to reveal or he

841
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,810
doesn't care because the joke is for

842
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:30,730
himself he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> loves it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so here I am</font>

850
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:55,450
