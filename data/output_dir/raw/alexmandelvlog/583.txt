cocaine comes from the plant coca and

280
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,959
coca leaves are chewed like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Bolivia</font>

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take off the leaves they chew them</font>

282
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,490
and it sounds bad but it pretty much has

283
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,589
like the same effects as caffeine the

284
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,300
reason why cocaine is so bad is because

285
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,149
it's a very extracted purified form of

286
00:16:06,149 --> 00:16:09,070
