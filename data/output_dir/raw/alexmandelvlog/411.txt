with us but this one this DSLR has full

44
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,030
auto focus while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should like</font>

45
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:47,090
continuous autofocus but no the other

46
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,750
dsm the other kid and DSLRs do not some

47
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,920
other companies have made it but

48
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,540
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my lenses to be</font>

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,450
interchangeable between my cameras and i

50
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,980

52
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:02,780
lot more on a good lens that you do want

53
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">a good camera if you're going for DSLR</font>

54
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,590
so this one has a flip-out screen and

55
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,850
continuous autofocus so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could aim it</font>

56
