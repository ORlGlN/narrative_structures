11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,780

12
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,489
going to go run and dive into my pool

13

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,030
into the shallow end I dove into the

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,370
deepest<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of the pool it's like I</font>

16

think it's like 10-feet besides it's

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,800
it's a deep deep end and i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was on</font>

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,199
a Ledge it happened to dive so perfectly

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,699
straight down that if you guys have ever

20
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:04,619
done like a pencil dive into the water

21
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,840
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> jump straight like make it so</font>

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,119
your feet hit the ground that's that's

23
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,270
what happened but it hit my head and I

24
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,920
gashed my head I gashed my nose<font color="#E5E5E5"> I broke</font>

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,680
my nose and because it had hit and gone

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,340
like this and it made my head go back it

27
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,500
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and I had a compression</font>

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,140
fracture in my spine between my shoulder

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,540
blades that sucked I'd physical therapy

30
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,040
for like three months I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> still feel</font>

31
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,600
it now so like when I work out my

32
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,430
trainer he makes sure everything's like

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,590
perfect form and getting everything is

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,070
good you know three years later I still

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,960
feel that pinpoint doesn't hurt me but I

36
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">can feel but the thing that does hurt is</font>

37
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,220
every so often because I'm working out

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,310
if I lift heavy stuff I do stuff I start

39
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,990
to get painted again and the muscles

40
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,229
around it tense up so all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

41
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,689
thought just sharing<font color="#CCCCCC"> an experience with</font>

46
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,850

47
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,010
around it that tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure it</font>

48
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,020
does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's protecting it doesn't</font>
