my neck for more acupuncture so that my

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,240

<font color="#E5E5E5">the office which is closer to that so</font>

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,549
that i can at least avoid freeway time

00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:36,630
and traffic time so that I can be around

13
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that area so I think that's what we're</font>

drone video and who does all the drone

97
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,560
stuff he's like is it cool if I use your

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,630
laptop just to use just to edit some of

99
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,410
the stuff on it so yeah to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

100
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:15,020
application to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it going into to open</font>

101
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,000
things on my computer usually I push

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,920
open and then like I'll go away and

103
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,600
leave and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that it turns on like</font>

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,850
sometimes I'm like laptop it's sold not

105
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,680
old not necessarily super old but it's

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,750
so overly used and slow and terrible

107
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,960
weather one that it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken up to 10</font>

108
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes to open software with nothing</font>

109
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,470
running nothing else running with

110
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,890
nothing I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done a full system reset on</font>

111
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,660
the computer emptied out just to see

112
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,160
what to do it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's i think it's</font>

113
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,660
just dying so i'm so happy to have a new

114
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,650
that I get stuff done because one of the

115
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,420
reasons I even started editing on my

116
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,250
iPad for vlogs and stuff like that is

117
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,870
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of editing it</font>

118
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,140
would crash<font color="#CCCCCC"> just couldn't handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

119
00:06:57,140 --> 00:07:00,360
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> now actually I'm pretty sure</font>

120
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,520
now will be so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and I'm</font>

121
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,850
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> that things will be smooth from</font>

122
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,220
here yeah after waiting all night for my

123
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,860
data transfer it said it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a total of</font>

124
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,830
over 30 hours to try to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it</font>

125
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,410
was doing it<font color="#CCCCCC"> over Wi-Fi and I just</font>

126
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,580
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait i need to use my computer</font>

127
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,140
and somebody that so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to cancel</font>

128
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,880
it which was scary because and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

129
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,100
want to start over but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and</font>

130
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,560
got myself a thunderbolt cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

131
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this transfers data really fast i think</font>

132
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:33,390
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 20 gigs a second so that's</font>

133
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,140
something in science so hopefully this

134
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,060
will make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much faster</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I</font>

135
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,260
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it again i hate that i'm</font>

136
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,440
restarting this transfer but hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

137
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,840
needed to be done so hopefully this will

138
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,700
this will do it I gotta restart I have

139
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,870
both these ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go we'll see instead</font>

140
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:55,380
of 30 hours or actually almost 31 hours

141
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,140
because it was 30 hours and 59 minutes

142
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,330
with this cable it is now three hours

143
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:04,650
and 43 minutes big<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference I could</font>

144
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,750
wait over three hours I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't wait</font>

145
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">for 30-something hours so oh and it just</font>

146
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,110
dropped from three now it's just three

147
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,210
hours and 33 minutes so I actually think

148
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's gonna go pretty quick it's just</font>

149
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,020
kind of jumping around here but I'm

150
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,580
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this all done and we're gonna</font>

151
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,050
start us off a new day<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because</font>

152
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,940
enjoyed watching today my pretty much

153
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,370
like unboxing of a new macbook<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro</font>
