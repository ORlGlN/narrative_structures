doing tonight is I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

55
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,440

be destructive except you just got

134
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,020
slapped in the face we looked up a bunch

135
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,700

136
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,990
the paint and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that the best</font>

137
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">option is to cover the car and</font>

138
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">all-purpose flour because if you try to</font>

142
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,730
it's a terrible prank because they have

143
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,180
to literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> like rub scrub it to get it</font>

144
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,550
off but it does not affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the finish of</font>

145
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,370
the car so I don't care if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he has to</font>
