129
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,020

130
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,270
her you know it's one tweet and she

131
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,849
probably gets bunch

132
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,449
what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we send thousands of tweets to</font>

133
00:06:25,449 --> 00:06:28,089
her then she's gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right</font>

134
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:30,039
at least that's the logic in my mind

135
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:32,139
that's working out right now so guys

136
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,129
let's tweet bomb kendall<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jenner we</font>

137
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,959
should do tweet bombing more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

138
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,999
messages to other people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this</font>

139
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,219
works out we'll tweet balm other people

140
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:43,990
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll try to set up other dates</font>

141
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,459
maybe we'll do some cool things to

142
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,919
celebrities that way celebrities barely

143
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,509
see our tweets right when we tweet them

144
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,789
once but what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole a team tweets</font>

145
00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:54,099
them to try to get something we want so

146
00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:56,139
let's tweet bomb and see if this works

147
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:59,830
so go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that but guys that's</font>

148
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,059
all i have for you today<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

149
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,740

150
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,300
can go out strong that we could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

151
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,119
