73
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,280
break or pretty much for any hidden

74
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,970
camera thing that I do on TV or even

75
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,400
with stuff I've done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube which</font>

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,069
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen much of but anyway</font>

77
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:14,340
all this stuff I do pretty nowadays

78
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,589
incorporates GoPros gopros are very

79
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,019
important just because they're so easy

80
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,570
to hide and just let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it roll you let it</font>

81
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,520
roll for hours and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these</font>

82
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,220
shots that other cameras just couldn't

83
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,169
get the thing is is I have so the normal

84
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,039
housing for my GoPro looks like this see

85
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,780
you guys know so the GoPro sits inside

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,389
of here and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's</font>

87
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:42,060
bulkier<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's these screws on the</font>

88
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,120
front are shiny you don't when you're

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,129
hiding a camera like

90
00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:47,419
this is meant for an action sports

91
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:54,139
camera so they're shiny and it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

92
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:57,050
know how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks and the camera goes</font>

93
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,699
inside of this is just the house is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,239
case but it's cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just harder for</font>

95
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,309
a hidden camera but now that the

96
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:06,709
applications are becoming so useful for

97
00:05:06,709 --> 00:05:08,809
production and they don't want something

98
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:13,099
as light colored and and with anything

99
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,929
that's reflective on it because thing is

100
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:17,389
like when I shoot for break we have to

101
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:19,339
make these hides these boxes that have

102
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,399
like black tinted windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like</font>

103
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:24,469
one-way mirror and so or to a mere

104
00:05:24,469 --> 00:05:26,330
whatever and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them right there</font>

105
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,860
but you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see through because</font>

106
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,809
those shiny screws or something so we

107
00:05:29,809 --> 00:05:33,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">just hope they don't look but GoPro has</font>

108
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,619
just released their new housing which is

109
00:05:36,619 --> 00:05:40,369

118
00:05:58,749 --> 00:06:01,879

119
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:04,089
suction cup mount so it's actually I'm

120
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:06,889
putting all my body weight<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

121
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:08,149
suction cup is sucking out of the

122
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:12,759
counter but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this camera is so hidden</font>

123
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,589
it's so it like you could put this it

124
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,039
even comes with it comes with stickers

125
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,009
comes with these black stickers even so

126
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:24,110
you can hide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> little LCD screen not</font>

127
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:25,929
that that's going to show anything but

128
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:29,179
that's how hidden there now allowing it

129
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,369
to be so now like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always see those</font>

130
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:34,329
videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people in an elevator like</font>

or you know all of them do different

133
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,709
things but usually they'll use a GoPro

134
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,869
up there as soon as people look up

135
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:47,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're like oh it's a GoPro this is</font>

136
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,819
much easier to hide when it's black in

137
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner of something or kind of</font>

138
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:54,169
