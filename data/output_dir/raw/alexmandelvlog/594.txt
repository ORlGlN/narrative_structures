black tape and we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to make</font>

109
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,590
our own but don't worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not wasting</font>

110

113
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:25,880
with all the stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that always happens</font>

114
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't be surprised if</font>

115
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,950
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken the altoids out I</font>

116
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,050
get pulled over and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this</font>

117
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,140
is is something else does it just

118
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:41,090
doesn't look very good right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

119
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,730
my my proof that it is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> altoids</font>

120
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,370
because he's he's taping that up right

121
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,510
now

122
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,240
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> altoids we're almost done</font>

123
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,580
covering the altoids box but I decided I

124
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,870
was like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what right before you</font>

125
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,910

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:19,910
we should yeah well John la guerra we

129
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,130

130
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">cards are too big to fit in and out</font>

131
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,730
towards case so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a waste of time</font>
