working on this cool app that's going on

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,190
is the app out yet it's in beta right

23
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,469
now so it's a version<font color="#E5E5E5"> one okay well what</font>

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,059
it is is they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restaurants all over</font>

25
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:05,479
and bottles water and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

26
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,270
what they do is they test the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TDS is</font>

27
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,010
that what is that test ideas you have

28
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,799
tes<font color="#E5E5E5"> total dissolved solids in your water</font>

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,600
so score of 200 is about the average

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,750
line things above that or considered bad

31
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,299
considered global that means like

32
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:26,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're filtering their water most</font>

33
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,409
likely and it's it's go drink<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

34
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,470
testing right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 198</font>

35
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,090
so they're kind of about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average</font>

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:36,570
line average so it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,450
drink this and it'll be fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but if</font>
