53
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,100
camera sucks in low light if you watch

00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,770
never focuses it's out of focus all time

57
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,250
isn't even in focus now not really focus

58
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:11,850
this cameras like kinda it's not crappy

59
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,910
it's great but it's it doesn't behave

60
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,670
very well it's very stubborn in low

61
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,070
light it's grainy or dark even though it

62
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't that dark last night it wasn't</font>

00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">showing at all so you guys are saying</font>

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,580
you need a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow camera you need</font>

65
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,740
one its fire quality you need one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

66
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,270
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> see low light I agree and so I've</font>

67
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,350
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research and some</font>

68
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,010
cameras and before I get I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i'm</font>

69
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,930
pretty set<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've been looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a bunch</font>

70
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:41,970
of different comparisons what does well

71
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,680
a little light what has this feature is

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,720
everything i think i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to order</font>

73
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,470
myself maybe a canon g7x which is

74
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're pretty new like point shoot</font>

75
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,660
camera I know some of you recommend

76
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,250
certain cameras you got to remember this

77
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,050
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fit in my pocket all the time</font>

78
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,230
and so it can't be big and bulky because

79
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,660
I get a great camera but it's huge so it

80
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,940
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be smaller the g7x seems to be</font>

81
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good with low light and it</font>

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,580
has in the screen like a flip-up thing

83
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,780
in the back so I could see myself

84
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously I still have to look at the</font>

85
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,770
lens and up or else it'll look like I'm

86
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,060
doing videos like this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not even</font>

87
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,490
looking at you guys so but it is a cool

88
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,950
feature for me to have that be able to

89
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,300
make sure it's in focus and stuff like

90
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,950
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna I think when</font>

91
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,960
you get that camera answer your request

92
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,690

95
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,690
video like a New Year's party and you

96
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,729
can't really see much because of that

97
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,379
which is why you notice when Jake was

98
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,909
pouring champagne house like I knee turn

99
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,110
lights on they need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

100
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,990
some of this like it's kind of I hate
