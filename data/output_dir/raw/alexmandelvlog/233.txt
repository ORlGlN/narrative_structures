sunken tennis court used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,098
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a tennis court we used to</font>

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:11,459
stuff around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> least set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ramps for</font>

38
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,340
bikes and skateboards

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,930
and soon as we put up these like old

40
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,200
wooden bunkers like I mean plywood<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,489
we would lean against something call it

42
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:21,140
a bunker and we play like air stock down

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,870
there and stuff like that we've set up a

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really long slip and slide on it it's</font>

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,800
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been that's been this better of fun</font>

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,569
spot I haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it'd be cool</font>

47
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:31,640
like to just like do a vlog or do like

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,670
old fun stuff I used to do is it when I

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,920
was younger here just play around and do

50
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,989
stupid stuff I feel like when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

51
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,610
older you just stop doing stupid stuff

52
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,140
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably a good thing but a</font>

53
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,930
vlog is a good reason to to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

is right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is made by Caltech and</font>

65
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:25,310
it is the this is closed on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

66
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,170
the kel-tec KSG crazy bullpup style

67
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,810
shotgun this has been made famous by

68
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,109
movies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> John wick with Keanu Reeves</font>

69
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,160
as well as black ops 2 you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get this</font>

70
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,889
shotgun the very interesting thing a

71
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,599
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> intriguing thing that I found love</font>

72
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">with about this shotgun is that it</font>

73
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,329
actually has two magazine barrels or

74
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,889
magazine tube sorry that's my men

75
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:57,169
magazine tubes the barrels up here so it

76
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">has tubes go forward and back so if you</font>

77
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,669
look in here you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually see you</font>

78
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:03,230
load it in two different areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

79
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,160
has a selector on which to which allows

80
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,239
this very short shotgun to hold 14

81
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:13,790
rounds plus one in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chamber or if</font>

82
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,109
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short shells</font>

83
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:16,459
which you can buy short shells you can

84
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably get up to 24 shells plus 1</font>

85
00:04:18,728 --> 00:04:21,139
whereas my big shotgun can hold about

86
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:22,048
seven

87
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,990
plus one so this one is definitely I'm

88
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,300
definitely very intrigued to take this

89
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,490
out and try it out I got some

90
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,199
accessories for it it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

91
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:37,169
any sort of sites at all so I just got

92
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,629
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> magpul flip up sights front and</font>

93
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:42,150
rear as well as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> magpul</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for grip now</font>

94
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,099
this is where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets interesting with</font>

95
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:48,599
this this is a mostly polymer gun so for

96
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:49,949
those who don't know but pretty much

97
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,860
plastic this Picatinny rail on the

98
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom of the lower rail this one</font>

99
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:57,060
appears metal this one down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is is</font>

100
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,440
polymer and people we're hooking on for

101
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,340
grips to the polymer rail so that they

102
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:08,009
can they can pump it like that the

103
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,110
problem is is they would push it forward

104
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">really fast and because this is just a</font>

105
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,849
polymer rail these teeth with sometimes

106
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:18,870
break off this would fly forward the gun

107
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">being pretty heavy over here not too</font>

108
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,550
heavy but it would start to fall now

109
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,969
their hand is is right here and their

110
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,469
finger would be in the trigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> guard and</font>

111
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:31,219
what would catch the gun as its falling

112
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:34,919
their finger it would fire the gun

113
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:36,599
because their finger be on the trigger

114
00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:38,520
for taming downrange or wherever they

115
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,250
are but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're for grip would fly off</font>

116
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,139
the vertical foregrip and it would now

117
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,849
dip down aim at their hand and they were

118
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:47,099
blowing their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands off that's why</font>

119
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,779
people start to get really scared of

120
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:51,180
this if you search KSG accident or hand

121
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,389
accident or anything I<font color="#CCCCCC"> warn you ahead of</font>

122
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:55,860
time they do show pictures and it's

123
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">disgusting but people have blown off</font>

124
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:00,169
their hands of this so this company was

125
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:02,969
awesome to send me this this was made by

126
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-tech custom concepts this is a</font>

127
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,550
metal it's actually goes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah this</font>

128
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,490
way a metal adapter that slides on and

129
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on now it</font>

130
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:17,819
actually screws in locks in it's all

131
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,860
good and the teeth will not break off

132
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,870
and when I'm using it it'll pull on this

133
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,569
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so there is no more chance</font>

134
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:26,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an accident and if you guys ever buy</font>

135
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,909
this the KSG do not put a vertical

136
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:32,610
foregrip with on the polymer rail you

137
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,230
need a metal

138
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,070
this is metal a metal rail adapter for

139
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,960
this to the full size so that you can

140
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,900
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the leverage of it and then you</font>

141
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,190
won't blow off your own hand so I'm

142
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,270
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all together and i'll</font>

143
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,590
show you guys what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that looks like it's</font>

144
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:51,420
all complete now it's got the metal

145
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,960
Picatinny rail adapter the magpul

146
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,990
vertical foregrip and the flip up sights

147
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,870
that you just hear this won't be easier

148
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,030
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you push this down so if you</font>

149
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,330
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> slower flip up there you have it</font>

150
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,600
there is the kel-tec KSG<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a better</font>
