38
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,870
actually was looking to get one pretty

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,190
soon anyway just to the tool wise lover

40
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,430
thank you I think the real test oh this

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,870
knife is can it cut paper because what's

42
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knife if it can't cut paper can it</font>

43
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:58,170
cut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh it cuts paper ah when i get</font>

44
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,360
bored i tinker around and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i took the</font>

45
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,360
knife and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i figured why not so I kind of</font>

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,880
sharpen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge of a like a skewer</font>

47
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,170
thing and they're already pretty sharp

48
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,930
but I made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sharper this tape is just</font>

49
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,910
so that it gets weighted down in front

50
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,060
and then I<font color="#CCCCCC"> also tapered down the back so</font>

51
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,620
that it's flat because if it's round

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,140
it's harder to grab and I have this

53
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">little like look at me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being stupid it's</font>

54
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,940
like what I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I was in high</font>

55
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,019
school anyway so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can hold it here</font>

56
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,680
and it's flat like put in the flat part

57
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,420
so it's flat here so that it's easy for

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,500
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with this band and then if</font>

59
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,310
I hold it here even from a distance pull

60
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:50,250
it yeah it works it works surprisingly

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,500
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of skewers yeah mr. tank is</font>
