started I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just got my package in with</font>

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,829
the final stuff i need the audio

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,510
equipment to make my audio sound good

17
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,370
using my DSLR my 7th ed that for the

18
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,989
drink stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got all the stuff here</font>

19
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,940
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a mess right now i have my</font>

20
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,550
two receivers on here my age my zoom h4n

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,390
i have the 3.5 millimeter going from

22
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,800
with the splitter here the splitter

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,539
makes it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can listen and headphones</font>

24
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:05,640
as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> just connect it straight into</font>

25
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,770
the camera here the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ran into</font>

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">is these receivers with the XLR inputs</font>

27
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,680
are is a balanced input now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not an</font>

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,960
audio guy so all the stuff I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

29
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,689
learned from doing research but when you

30
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:22,170
try to plug one of these into here you

31
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,780
can the problem is is it already tries

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,150
to amplify and then amplify more inside

33
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it so it creates as fuzzy craziness</font>

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,229
so I learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> you needed an inline</font>

35
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,740
attenuator so I got these sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> inline</font>

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,210
attenuators which then see then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

37
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,050
take this

38
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,930
connect that into here then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this</font>

39
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,290
whole set up and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it into there I</font>

40
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,750
can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with one hand I'm trying try</font>

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,510
anyway there goes in there it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

42
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,300
a super long setup thing it actually it

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,970
cuts the audio down by negative 50

44
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:01,180
decibels so whereas you would have a

45
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,610
game but like knob to turn the gain up

46
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,200
this would kind of be like a loss you

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,480
put it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> from positive to a negative</font>

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,240
and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I could use my</font>

49
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,250
law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mics and be able to set them up</font>

50
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,660
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get clear audio so hopefully the</font>

51
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,070
ideals great you guys don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

52
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,300
