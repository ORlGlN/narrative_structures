47
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,569
there's just so much walking at VidCon

48
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:23,380
that I had lost just over a pound to be

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,630
a bit cause I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> great and do that</font>

50
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,190
all the time he grabbed me lose a little

51
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,540
weight but I'm still feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I need to</font>

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,859
days a week for those you talk now and

54
00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:40,209
that's it's tough but I make myself do

55
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:43,180
it that I can be healthier and so that I

56
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,590
could live the lifestyle I like because

57
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys know I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat and if i</font>

58
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,910
wasn't working out and I was eating the

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,489
way I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would be a much bigger person</font>

60
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,829
