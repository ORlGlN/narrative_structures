00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,220
you're going to be like it but it

70
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,959

days

76
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,660
you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add pepper</font>

77
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:05,500

78
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,319
ability Mary is the Tabasco you can use
