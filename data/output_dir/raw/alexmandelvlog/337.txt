00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,790

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,400
chiropractor reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> being is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i told i</font>

00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,140
a bad massage and just it like did sign

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,700
in my neck and I was like okay it's sore

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,559
but it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better it's almost been</font>

15
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,100
to the chiropractor check it out

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,050

17
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,030
into place and that'll make<font color="#CCCCCC"> me feel</font>

18
