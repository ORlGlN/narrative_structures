113
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,830
I feel like at some point that might

114
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:20,139
happen to me with pranks so I'm crossing

115
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,979
my fingers but that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens I</font>

116
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:25,270
mean they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing pranks so they</font>

117
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,280
do check to make sure everything is

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,510
legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

119
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,940
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens they go to</font>

120
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,470
court and everything like that you know

121
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,150
and then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to say like</font>

122
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,490
prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they did nothing wrong</font>

123
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,199
you know the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you're going</font>

124
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,169
to prank and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cops get pissed they</font>

125
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,550
can arrest you and charge you pretty

126
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,900
much just a hassle you have to go to

127
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,729
court and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge to get dropped</font>

128
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,180
usually hopefully but up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a lighter</font>

they won't see it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> there like right</font>

140
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:16,930
there like oh you were filming sometimes
