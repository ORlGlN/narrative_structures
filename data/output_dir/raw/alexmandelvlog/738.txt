you have a great strategy for dating let

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:20,400

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,159
of you are on it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you have a</font>

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,930
choice of liking or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like them</font>

33
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,409
all and then eventually I get to you

34
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,270
know this way that sometimes sometimes a

35
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,600
guy slips through I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop it out</font>

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,500
sometimes he pushes like in a guy

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,939
there's nothing wrong with that matter I

38
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:38,189
mean ultimately if they say like then I

39
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,110
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide so yeah like I'm going on</font>

40
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,030
