my oatmeal because if I was a goose I

137
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:05,810
don't have to run around and not enjoy

138
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:17,930

full-fledged relationship was about<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine</font>

143
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:28,009
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the only reason I stayed</font>

144
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:29,810
single so long is hopefully that one day

145
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,159
they'll come with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contest of who</font>

146
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,810
could be single the longest and I know

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,000
answered it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,349
fast enough for I didn't like the

153
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:47,870
question people who say there's no

154
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,320
stupid questions there are and you guys

155
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,599
