47
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,940
ways to get more whether it's bartending

48

49
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:20,890

that he got a lot more damn son d soon I

51
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,769
could totally prank Jake and make him

52
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:43,450
think that someone sent him this money

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some odd reason but how do I make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

54
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,080
more believable I can't just write a

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,670
letter handwritten who's gonna send you

56
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:55,390
know this much cash so I found this like

57
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:59,590
letter from Silicon Valley Bank which

58
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,180
could easily be some sort of start up

59
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,280
something whatever someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> said like hey</font>

60
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,590
what I don't whatever he's doing some

61
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,739
sort of cash advance I<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like if i</font>

62
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:10,780
have this shift<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's already it has like</font>

63
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,360
a postage everything it's already been

64
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,920
shipped there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just nothing and i could</font>

65
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,630
print up some fake things so that he

66
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,910
believes it reseal it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i opened</font>

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,090
it carefully so that just you know not

68
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,260
damaged and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i went to their website</font>

69
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,810
at silicon valley bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could just take</font>

70
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,540
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can just do a screenshot of that</font>

71
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,940
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that into a document have it sent</font>

72
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,220
like written out to him and make it look

73
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">so much more official right out</font>

74
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,329
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to him and hopefully believes</font>

75
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,590
it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope it works as you can see it</font>

76
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:43,269
already with the logo in it and if i

77
00:03:43,269 --> 00:03:45,130
write his name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then address right</font>

78
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,510
below and stuff like that i could put it

79
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,400
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this little window here and it'll be</font>

80
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,670
great I just need I need to figure out

81
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,470
why he would be getting mail here and

82
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,489
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be addressed to his house</font>

83
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,769
unless I do his home address and then

84
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:01,930
say his brother dropped it off or

85
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,850
something

86
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,630
I could do that I'll do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I I have</font>

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,320
mailed to him and he wouldn't believe it

91
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,730
