151
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,409
morning it gives me one less thing to

152
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:41,479
think about throughout the day to open

153
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,009
up a drawer and pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of a stack of</font>

154
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,810
black shirts open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next door pull</font>

155
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,360
out my black jeans I have my black socks

156
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,150
and shoes I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look the same it's</font>

157
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,650
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I care about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking the same</font>

158
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,669
we're looking different or anything like

159
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:54,080
that it's just about I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that</font>

160
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,389
that thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what should I wear today</font>

161
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,690
takes out that one thought one extra

162
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,979
thought that you don't need throughout

163
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,719
the day and the funny thing was is I

164
00:07:02,719 --> 00:07:04,729
told my friends know this and they sent

165
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">me a speech that Mark Zuckerberg had and</font>

166
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,719
they asked him why he always wears the

167
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,849
same thing and literally in his speech

168
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:14,060
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to take one thing out</font>

169
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,430
of my day that I hit the night so that I

170
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,870
didn't have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that it was</font>

171
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,490
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give myself</font>

172
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,710
one less thing to think about and I was

173
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,509
like well hey if CEO facebook says it

174
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:28,490
must be true but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way I've</font>

175
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,110
been for a long time with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> black love</font>

176
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,349
but that's the reason I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that this</font>

177
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,770
is a good time for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get i watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

178
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,289
have a new idea it's it's not only my

179
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:40,940
idea it's something that came from a lot

180
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,319
of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys who have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watching my</font>

181
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,150
twitch streams everything you guys have

182
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,009
been asking for this a lot for so for

183
00:07:46,009 --> 00:07:47,870
the past few weeks a lot of you've

184
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,219
already known up and do this because you

185
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,440

186
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,650

188
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,310

189
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,479
going to put pranks on but now I'm

190
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,520

192
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,630
