00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,099
Pokey and you turn yourself around

133
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,720

little bit forward then once it's

152
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:55,959
forward like this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want the</font>

153
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,029
front to go towards Mac just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the front</font>

154
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:03,639
and then fix that part the I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

155
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it kind of goes</font>

156
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,819
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward this and then this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

157
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,049
back you want to take like two

158
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:10,119
directions right now it's flat so then

159
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:14,019
you take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comb put it up and just let</font>

160
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:15,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">it drop side at you I'll show you this</font>

161
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,749
put it up and then pull it sideways so

162
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:25,299
you get it to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font>

163
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:28,329
to do facing down so I can show you yeah

164
00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:30,790
once it's like this I faces my hand

165
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:33,670
because you don't want to be like super

166
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,779
perfect from your column

167
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,140
and now brush right behind so that they

168
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,240
go down try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the perfect wave it's</font>

169
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,820
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the perfect wave and then</font>

170
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:58,779
fix the rest fix it

171
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,930
and that stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> America crew fiber</font>

172
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,259
is water soluble so it's just like super

173
00:11:05,259 --> 00:11:07,839
easy to if you want to wash it off your

174
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,249
hands you don't even have to use silver

175
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:11,680
anything it just comes off stay with

176
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,999
your hair when I go in the shower as

177
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,670
soon as I go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the water it's out</font>

178
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,139
it's not like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you so much</font>

185
00:11:36,249 --> 00:11:38,290
directions is that if you notice my hair

186
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,990
