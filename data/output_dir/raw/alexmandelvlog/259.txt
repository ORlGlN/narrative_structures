00:00:05,779 --> 00:00:08,910
hey guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a new day today and I am</font>

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on my way to physical therapy</font>

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,299
for my neck my neck is still not perfect

4
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:19,699
but it is much much better than it was

5
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:23,850
so I'm happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that it has four</font>

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:25,410
pretty good range of motions it's not

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,369
perfect so hopefully that goes well

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:31,439
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's difficult since it's not</font>

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical therapy and then we won't be</font>

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,989
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with our day we will continue we will</font>

11
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,670
have ourselves a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good day like we always</font>

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,480
do now that i'm done with that went by

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,820
super fast for you guys right was like a

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,260
second now i am going I'm just turning

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,890
into the parking lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan hair and i am</font>

16
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,820
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> game stuff because i would like</font>

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,660
to get black ops 3 I do not have black

18
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,229
ops 3 and I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually did a poll on</font>

19
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,990
Twitter I like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> new poll feature I</font>

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,479
did a poll on Twitter to see what

21
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,570
console I should get it for xbox one or

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,390
ps4 and sixty percent said ps4 which is

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,340
why I'm getting it for xbox one that's

24
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,020
not why I actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> am getting it for</font>

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,600
xbox one but the reason is not to go

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,159
against what you guys said the reason is

27
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,670
because I have always been an xbox guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

28
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:34,979
love ps4 but I grew up on xbox playing

29
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,130
halo and everything but it's because I

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,770
wanted to to stream it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> gilroy was</font>

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,780
texting<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and asked me if I have black</font>

32
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,299
ops 3 so that we can do a co stream

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,909
together so we can you know somehow do

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,040
one together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cool across our</font>

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,399
across our twitch channels and I said to

36
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,530
him<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like oh wait a second do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,600
have it for ps4 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> xbox money goes I</font>

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,610
have it on xbox one so that is why I

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,950
made my decision so that I could stream

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,190
it play it with Gilroy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

41
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,720
could buy it for whatever system you

42
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,610
like but if your friends are on it it

43
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,200
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that much fun</font>

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
I have a few friends that are on xbox

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,099
and that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what made up my decision</font>

46
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:23,989
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> looky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here call of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> duty black ops 3</font>

47
00:02:23,989 --> 00:02:26,970
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play this I might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just pop</font>

54
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,230
while I'm on the toilet I actually

55
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,780
because I did you know the sponsored

00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,489

57
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:01,079
