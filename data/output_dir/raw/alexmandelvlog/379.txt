4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,090

<font color="#CCCCCC">of it what's brain yeah it's so sick</font>

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,730
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm played the new Batman game</font>

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,410
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> check it out I don't really</font>

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,420
know we have in store for<font color="#E5E5E5"> today but like</font>

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,880
always we're gonna have ourselves a good

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,610
time now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just did my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hair how I how I</font>

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,739
normally do so now you probably know

12
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,040
this this hairstyle here so that's how

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is intended to look and it didn't</font>

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">look like this yesterday or few minutes</font>

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,309
ago so this is the extra markup once the

16
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:50,190
wax kind of dries in my hair then

17
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,500
because it needs to hold it cuz my hair

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,320
wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick straight up so once it</font>

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,420
starts to dry then I start running my

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands through it again to kind of take</font>

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,780
it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it gives it more volume and</font>

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,270
sticks higher when it goes back but in

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,180
case any of you even care but but that's

24
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,570
that's the the extent of this so if any

25
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are saying my hair can't do that my</font>

26
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:13,140
