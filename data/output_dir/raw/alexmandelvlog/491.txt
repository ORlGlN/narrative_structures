flake in Venice we have the sandwich

8
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,820
called the super crow Joe which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,470
egg croissant sandwich is so good but

10
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,019
anyway I'm gonna head over there and do

11
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,820
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw some of your comments you</font>

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,380
guys a loving<font color="#CCCCCC"> the quality of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,450
camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw that some of you said and I</font>

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,710
didn't know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> till the editing</font>

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,989
actually that the audio cut out a few

16
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:42,690
times not cut out<font color="#E5E5E5"> but like went low and</font>

17
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,940
you guys were saying I was covering the

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,980
mic I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold the camera on top I</font>

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,480
hold it on the side so there's no one's

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,850
coming the mic I realized some nicer

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,059
cameras have wind cut filters and what

22
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:56,129
that does is if it starts to like get

23
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:58,020
really windy or something if I'm filming

24
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,420
it'll automatically a like cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> the audio</font>

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,650
down so that you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font>

26
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:09,119
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> shhh the whole time and that's</font>

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,820
great for<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people because most</font>

28
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,100
people don't talk to their cameras every

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,650

32
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it won't go low audio again but other</font>
