22
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,020
way to look in the audition<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like you</font>

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,110
go in you did what you had to do and you

24
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,780
know you may get a job out of it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,509
may not but as an actor it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> better to</font>

26
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,000
think of your job is to go in and give

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,320
them your best work your job is not to

28
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,299
get the other job or<font color="#E5E5E5"> else you're too I</font>

29
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,740
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the job you're auditioning</font>

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,229

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,150
something that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped me is</font>

34
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,240
like focus on your audition not on the

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,950
part that you're hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get because</font>

36
