00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,580
hey guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> umm Ali you guys wouldn't</font>

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,040
believe how I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,910
believably unbelievably pissed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am the</font>

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,789
reason I'm pissed is because it is

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,699
currently like Anna 11pm and I was

6
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,240
filming one of my clips and I was like

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,750
ah that's crap and normally if I decide

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,130
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put something in my vlog i'll</font>

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,960
edit it later but I was like I'm just

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,719
gonna do lead off my camera stupidly I

11
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,750
didn't push delete on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I formatted the</font>

12
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,809
card and for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who don't know what</font>

13
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:48,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it clears the whole thing that</font>

14
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,510
means every clip I've done today is gone

15
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,390
I went on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I asked if there</font>

16
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,260
were any suggestions for recovery

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,600
software for SD cards and I went through

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,699
three different<font color="#CCCCCC"> software's all of them</font>

19
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,900
took about did about 35 minutes cans all

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,960
coming up empty I think this camera just

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,299
does a pretty good job at formatting

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,820
which is unfortunate for me so I'm at a

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,830
loss<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't know and I'm like I</font>

24
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,509
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what to do at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

25
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,100
I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have no vlog</font>

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,860
because today was pretty good not that

27
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,240
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because it doesn't</font>

28
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,610
here so i'll give you what I can but we

29
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,350
make mistakes and this one was a crappy

30
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,009
one if you remember a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlogs back you</font>

31
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:37,170
would know that I lost my keys in the

32
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,990
crack of doom and the crack of doom is

33
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:44,080
larger ring

34

74
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,380
shaft and see exactly where the keys are

75
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,030
if they balanced and went somewhere else

204
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:14,570
birthday I was quite intoxicated I was

205
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,570
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a Ledge and i started i</font>

206
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,790
proceeded to pour Grey Goose over my

207
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:24,050
head while holding action beer in the

208
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,790
other hand like that I hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a corner</font>

209
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,200
and start spraying anyway I was

210
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,780
ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I started doing that then</font>

211
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,270
i set it down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i ran towards the pool</font>

212
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:37,610
I ran to the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pool not it's</font>

213
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,160
like up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Ledge and I drove into the</font>

214
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,750
pool into the deep end not the shallow

215
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:46,270
him and I lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the douve straight down</font>

216
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,260
because like if you've ever done a

217
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,060
pencil dive and you go straight down you

218
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">hit the bottom that's what I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

219
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:58,130
head and I I hit my head at the bottom

220
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:01,370
here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it threw my head back I gosh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

221
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,920
took a chunk out of my nose gashed my

222
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,120
head and because of that that throwback

223
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,900
it compressed my friend my vertebrae my

224
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,490
spine and I got a compressed

225
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">fractured right between my shoulder</font>

226
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,740
blades so it didn't feel good and I'm

227
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,050
lucky<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I didn't get knocked out</font>

228
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,690

288
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,670
part of the reason you guys have kind of

289
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,430
seen a decline in daily vlogs and it's

290
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,870
not because I don't want to give you

291
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,850
