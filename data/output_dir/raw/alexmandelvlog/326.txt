sharp to scrape these are different kind

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:24,790
of it they're different kind

46
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:33,690

54
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,150
close to not to cause I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

55
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,190
