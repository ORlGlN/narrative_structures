10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,430
I could stream this and then the game

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">started making me nauseous and then</font>

wanted to to let you guys know and it's

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,020
not necessarily me giving you an excuse

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,820
it's me just keeping you in the loop so

20
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,469
you guys know what's going on because

21
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,480
you guys sometimes I've just missed a

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,980
day not said anything and you guys are

23
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,710
like hey what the hell happens I figured

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,440
I'd let you guys know but today is also

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,699
at five o'clock would be the first

26
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,840

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works i have to continue taking</font>

30
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,280
medication someone commented yesterday

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,990
asking or telling me that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

32
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep saying I'm taking medication of</font>

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,530
taking pills the reason why I'm saying

34
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,170
is I'm afraid of looking high or

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:22,530
slurring words and you guys not knowing

36
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,960
or someone who comes and watches a vlog

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,430
and hasn't watched previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,619
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm some sort of druggie</font>

39
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to read I like to re i</font>

40
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:37,020
lost my thought

41
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,479
I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you guys more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than once</font>

42
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,530
and reminded each vlog that the reason

43
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,140
is medication for my next so that people

44
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,759
aren't just like wow he's clearly on

45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,170

46
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,960
