love talking all that you guys but I

47
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,750
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all the viewership watching</font>

48
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,419
the live carries over to the viewership

49
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:12,640
of the video like when it actually goes

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,710
live and people can watch the replay of

51
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,680
it that it would still show the view

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,440
count it resets back at zero and all of

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,390
the chat<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not comments or anything</font>

54
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,930
it's just gone so now and it doesn't

55
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">notify that now there's a new video up</font>

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,760
it just puts it up so it's been up<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

69
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we should keep the live streams</font>

73
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,480

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of a rush right now because</font>

have those Brandon got some for me

157
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:14,560
instead of putting ice to water down

158
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,750

161
00:08:23,979 --> 00:08:26,259
drinking section Wahlberg's I was

162
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,949
showing Roman that on these vlog cameras

163
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,740
they can slow it down that they have 906

164
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,979
up to 900 60 frames a second to do super

165
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,599
slow mo it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to turn on the sink</font>

166
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,729
looks really cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it automatically</font>

167
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:41,860
drops it into 16 times slow mo which

168
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,630
drops into 60 frames a second but you

169
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,880
could technically to go down to like 30

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,380
frames a second and it'll still look

171
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,660
super slow I mean to still look super

172
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,230
smooth but you'll double up to 32 times

173
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:56,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">level so I actually want to try that</font>

174
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,390
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting up lighting in your honor</font>

175
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,190
should do water should we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

176
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,290
else no<font color="#E5E5E5"> no what we should do yeah drop</font>

177
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,680
drop pieces

178
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
wow that would just shattered like that

179
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,089
oh I will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what to do</font>

180
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,430
on here but I that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is cool to think that</font>

181
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,950
you can actually make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32 times not 16</font>

182
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,260
which I've done on here before if you've

183
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,880
seen like on Harvey's Instagram I

184
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,130
through Harvey onto the bed and did<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

185
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,470
in the 16-time<font color="#CCCCCC"> slo-mo so let's see what</font>

186
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">it looks like in 32 needs so much you</font>

187
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,440
need a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of light because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the faster</font>

188
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,690
the frame rate it's not capturing when

189
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,490
the frame rates lower captures more

190
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,760
light as the faz it's faster it can't

191
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,740
capture as much light so it looks darker

192
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,420
so you have to have as much like light

193
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,740
as possible so we're going to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

194
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,420
angle that light or do something to get

195
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,820
enough light Roman just<font color="#E5E5E5"> popped one on</font>

196
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,950
