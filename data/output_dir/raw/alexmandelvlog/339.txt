103
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,930
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great you could buy premade or</font>

104
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,820
maybe i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a video to show you how</font>

105
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,460
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make different flavors of</font>

106
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,600
alchemy your own homemade alcohol

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,280
infused whipped cream which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is fun to</font>

108
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,140
make but what I wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I</font>

109
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,320
wanted to make flaming whipped cream I

110
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,390
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make flammable whipped cream</font>

111
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,400
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you could top a drink with it</font>

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,650
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cream would be there as you</font>

113
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,300
serve it you light it on fire and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,610
would melt down into the Drake I thought

115
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be so cool I've never seen</font>

116
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,900
that before the problem being is I used

117
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,750
I have a whipped cream maker and I used

118
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">everclear so see I've been trying it</font>

119
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,710
here to load these up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chargers to</font>

120
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,770
make the whipped cream the first time I

121
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,350
made it whipped cream came out great

122
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,360
wouldn't light but Lisa's big the next I

123
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
made it comes out<font color="#CCCCCC"> like liquid because I</font>

124
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,810
added more everclear because it would

125
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,810
light but when i add more Everclear and

126
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,420
have less whipping cream it can't hold

127
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,030
but I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

128
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,380
if at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least it'll still like because</font>

129
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,880
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could just make flammable cream</font>

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,210
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even like because if you</font>

131
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,790
light a cocktail or shop you float the

132
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,160
flammable liquid on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top and you like</font>

133
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,410
that as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mixes with the heavy</font>

134
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,640
whipping cream or any other ingredient

135
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,700
it begins to dilute itself and bring the

136
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,790
percentage down and can't light on fire

137
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,740
so it mixes too much in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font>

138
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,790
going to work but I tried we'll see i'm

139
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,930
gonna keep trying to make some cool

140
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,000

142
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,800
I tried I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to Roman and he</font>

143
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,169
