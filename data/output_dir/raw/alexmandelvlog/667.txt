and they're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like these happy</font>

73

something that people just aren't happy

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,110

watch those videos too and you know what

132
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,630
it may happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in some of the</font>

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,979
pranks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm all about you know a</font>

134
00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:24,050
prank should make everyone laugh

hopefully including the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person you're</font>

136
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,860
pranking when when it's revealed so

137
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,070
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> my take on it I know I'm</font>

138
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,599
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contradict myself with some of</font>

that are fun I have fun doing either way

141
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,490
mess with people whether they're angry

142
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,740
or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I do believe that that people</font>

143
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,840
just need to learn to laugh a little

144
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,669
more and enjoy<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves and be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be</font>

176
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,280
of you like well cuz I did the baking

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
ones before and I made them from scratch

178
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,509
other other stuff like that we've made

179
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:13,789
this is not from scratch that's because

180
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:15,949
I don't want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> something from</font>

181
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:17,949
scratch right now right<font color="#CCCCCC"> before one I am</font>

182
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:20,919
but I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make these cookies because</font>

183
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,180
my mom got<font color="#CCCCCC"> me these these cookie cutters</font>

184
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,320
look at these how cool are these so what

185
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,620
you do is you cut the cookie like that

186
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,870
and you turn this around and it has the

187
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:39,919
imprint you imprint like the texture of

188
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,610
it and you make mustache cookies only

189
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:45,260
two of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these are really valid for my</font>

190
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:48,440

191
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,960
one and yeah and this these<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones</font>

192
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,099
