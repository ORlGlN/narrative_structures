33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,310
figured let's what's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to catch</font>

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,890
the culprit<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe it's a homeless</font>

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,240
guy that's stealing at all because one

36
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,790
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> i ordered a double tactical double</font>

37
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,610
rifle case and within the next two weeks

38
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,829
i saw a homeless guy walking around with

39
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,540
a double rifle tactical case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

40
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sure he didn't pick that up at</font>

41
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,409
his local Salvation Army unless the

42
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,240
Salvation Army is now equipping with

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,340
actual tactical rifles and I highly

44
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,190
doubt that so with that being said

45
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,740
I didn't go after him I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't going to</font>

46
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,420
because I didn't have proof I need proof

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,190
you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just approach someone in a</font>

48
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,110
queue someone unless you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the box</font>

49
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,400
there that was addressed to me or

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that was there and I don't</font>

51
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,220
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause</font>

52
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,740
problems I had that so did some research

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,170
today and I think that we should get a

54
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,220
GPS tracking device set up a decoy

55
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,410
package and catch this bitch yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

56
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">went to rei to pick up the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS tracker</font>

57
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:41,280
and the one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have is fine but</font>

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,980
it connects the satellites and so they

59
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,320
said that it only works if it's like in

60
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">open air needs to see like it's like if</font>

61
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
you're hiking some people can track you

62
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,590
so you won't get lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I needed</font>

63
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,570
like an asset tracker so I found one

64
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,140
online that had a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reviews</font>

65
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,730
unfortunately i'm trying to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to</font>

66
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,140
prevent stealing packages and i had to

67
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,240
get ordered so I made sure i'm going to

68
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,490
track exactly who has packages tomorrow

69
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,860
like I mean mailtraq like usps tracking

70
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,970
so that I know when the package gets are

71
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,250
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't get stolen hopefully my</font>

72
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,080
device to prevent stealing packages

73
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,320
doesn't get stolen but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then</font>

74
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,450
tomorrow I'll have the device and we can

75
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,930
start our covert operations to catch

76
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,050
this thief I'm starting off a new day on
