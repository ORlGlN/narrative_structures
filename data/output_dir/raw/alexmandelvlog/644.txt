<font color="#CCCCCC">happen see look how little I have left</font>

63
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,200
that's why I haven't been<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing my</font>

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,950
mustache a lot because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always run on</font>

65
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,450
these tubes and I literally have to

66
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,080
order them I can't find my color in the

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,690
store because you could buy neutral show

68
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:04,320
you you can buy neutral in any like CVS

69
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,000
or a pharmacy store but neutral is white

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,120
and it's it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like i have semen in</font>

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,330
my mustache and then i tried another

72
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,660
color I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get brown which I have</font>

73
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,530
right here Brown makes me look like I've

74
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:25,350
been eating out an asshole so I don't do

75
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,170
that neutral I'm sorry chestnut is the

76
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,430
color I use chestnut chestnut seems to

77
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,860
match my color where you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

78
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,510
tell I have anything if you guys look at

79
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,880
old pictures I used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think my color</font>

80
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,489
was brown so if you look it's really

81
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">dark on the tips and not so dark here</font>

82
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,470
because I can put it in too much here

83
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,840
chestnut yay pitch at night yeah when

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,300
you're putting this stuff on and you're

85
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this I wipe it on my cheek</font>

86
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,410
something my face sometimes here and

87
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,510
then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like you have poop smear</font>

88
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,820
on your cheeks so you got to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

89
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,910
q-tip and you wet it like under the

90
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,970
water and then I

91
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,280
just like take off the extra off my

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,410
cheek so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have coups me anymore</font>

00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:21,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">i won't take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that right now so i'll show</font>

96
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,930
you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much i take some people do more</font>

97
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,810
some people do less that right there

98
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">will handle my whole must absolutely do</font>

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">more yeah there we go now that it's</font>

100
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,200
right here this little poopy shithole

101
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,490
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take half of it and break it in</font>

102
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,310
half so looks like little turds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

103
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,160
work it into these<font color="#E5E5E5"> fingers we're getting</font>

104
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're getting then I mix up fingers so</font>

105
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:53,140
that it's all evenly distributed on all

106
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,370
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i don't want chunky</font>

107
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,790
somewhere and not chunky other places so

108
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:00,790
now look there's my<font color="#CCCCCC"> mustache fingers and</font>

109
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,970
what i do first is I take these and i

110
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,130
drove put it into my actual mustache

111
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,510
because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be blended</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

112
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,030
once I've done that it's in there you

113
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,500
can see it's been rubbed off my fingers

114
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,620
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> I take the remaining grab the</font>

115
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,030
ends and I kind of twist but if you

116
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,300
twist too much they oh I may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

117
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,640
already see<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this poop smear so</font>

118
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,100
if you twist too much then it actually

119
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,020
could twist down so you don't want to

120
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,790
twist you want to do more working it in

121
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,430
and pulling it straight out the only

122
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,250
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do a tiny tiny maybe like half</font>

123
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,540
twist is to get it to group together

124
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,590
because if it doesn't group together

125
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:47,050
then you get a shitty mustache so this

126
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,320
look I'm working it into the roots all

127
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,880
the way down the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you</font>

128
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,729
only put it in the ends it'll fall the

129
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:58,300
roots need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid and don't pull</font>

130
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,479
too hard because if you notice one side

131
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:03,070
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this side gets a little thin</font>

132
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,870
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm pulled too hard then pulls</font>

133
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,479
my hairs out yeah it sucks so now look

134
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:10,990
Oh set mustache but at least it's solid

135
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:15,150
now I can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> working it into a</font>

136
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">mustache so I'm trying to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

137
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,410
work the ends if you need to if your

138
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,120
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little dry you can put some</font>

139
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,080
more wax on but I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work it into a</font>

140
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
turn and i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what i do to make</font>

141
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">it look thicker to cheat it because it's</font>

142
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,180
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thick let's work these curves</font>

143
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:43,139
this one's<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking good let's do a</font>

144
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit there there we go and now</font>

145
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,610
work this one and two a curve now here's

146
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,740
where the cheating comes because if you

147
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,870
notice these aren't that thick you

148
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:57,419
squeeze them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I squeeze squeeze squeeze</font>

149
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,870
because it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat people that</font>

150
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,910
do it round it gets too thin if you

151
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,590
squeeze it flat while you're doing it

152
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,840
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at like a flat view of</font>

153
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,669
there so it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like twice as</font>

154
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,330
thick as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be that's how I make</font>

155
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so prominent you see that so that</font>

156
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,940
works out sorry I got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look in the</font>

157
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,740
mirror I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a can't see anything</font>

158
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,949
online camera so that's that side let me

159
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,840
squeeze this one and if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not perfect</font>

160
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,870
which it never is that's great you don't

161
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,310
want you mustache to be super perfect

162
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,419
but what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want is after you kind</font>

163
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,360
of shape it once it dries a little it

164
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,460
gets so solid that but you could still

165
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,990
move it because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just wax that</font>

166
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're putting in it mustache wax so</font>

167
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,210
once it's in the shape so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kinda</font>

168
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,889
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape of talking so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making it</font>

169
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:49,409
come out a little but once it's kinda in

170
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:51,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shape then you can let it dry and</font>

171
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,969
then you can mold it and it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

172
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:56,430
solid clay so there we go so this is

173
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,590
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it took to make a molestache</font>

174
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,680
now let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> just check the distance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

175
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,050
my face perfect you take this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

176
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,550
you got to get poop smear off your face

177
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,000
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again what this and just roll it</font>

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,729
that's all I do roll it on my face and

179
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:21,020
if you notice it's just pulling it off

180
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,280
doesn't it doesn't rub it all over my

181
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,300
face it just gets it off and I also made

182
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,080
poop smear all

183
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,539
the key to do this and a little bit

184
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:37,500
under here<font color="#E5E5E5"> just uh does now wash these</font>

185
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,539
fingers because I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get poop</font>

186
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:43,529
smear all over my face now I take my

187
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:47,190
nifty cone and I comb the rest into

188
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:56,279
shape shape it a little now from now on

189
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,589
you do not want any wet fingers at all

190
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:01,350
because it's wax and you'll put water in

191
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,290
it and it'll get all soft again so now

192
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,560
it's drying a little I could fully mold

193
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,850
it however I want let me squeeze this

194
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,459
