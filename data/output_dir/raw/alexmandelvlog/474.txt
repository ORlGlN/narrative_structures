23
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,500
towards the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> because my sister my</font>

24
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,479
older sister Jackie she was

25
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,060
breastfeeding my niece Abby in the

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,070
corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the restaurant and then she</font>

27
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,600
realized when she came back a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

28
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,700
later that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she said oh I left my phone</font>

29
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,369
there so she went<font color="#CCCCCC"> back there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cillin had</font>

30
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:48,929
already cleaned off the table and her

31
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,689
phone was gone now maybe someone picked

32
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:53,939
it up and collected it's fine she has

33
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,840
Find My iPhone on her on her thing but

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">when they use Find My iPhone someone it</font>

35
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:02,459
said the phone was already turned off

36
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,099
which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone took it and turned</font>

37
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,068
it off because they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can't</font>

38
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:09,959
use Find My iPhone anymore once you turn

39
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,690
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off so someone was an asshole and</font>

40
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,060
stole<font color="#CCCCCC"> my sister's phone that is bad that</font>

41
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,299
is a no-no so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately she's</font>

42
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:26,730
probably gonna have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find new foam the</font>

43
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,319
restaurant said they'll keep checking

44
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
