65

68
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it was because he had just made</font>

69
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:22,970
that video with romani oh and yeah how

70
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,280

71
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,100
twist oh yeah

72
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:41,510
happen a little disturbing what I want

73
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,080
to see what it looks like antsy

74
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,310
apparently how what do you guys think of

75
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,400
this seemed like a good day to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,740
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> boat out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're the dog right</font>

77
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,150
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's just loungin it's a you are</font>

78
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:02,270
the star you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sleep I'll take you</font>

79
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:04,550
for a ride on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the boat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me asleep but</font>

80
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,620
I think Brandon's coming coming its own

81
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,340
dropped off Ashley just got back home<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

82
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,400
couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do too much footage out in the</font>

83
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,230
boat because once we're moving it's so

84
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,590
windy that I tried do it was just like

85
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,740
and then it would cut out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was yeah</font>

86
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,480
anyway I'll get more footage another

87
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,250
point because Roman has these things

88
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,770
that he puts on his<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic on his that he</font>

89
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,760
can it filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the wind so maybe</font>

90
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,140
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get those from my camera so that</font>

91
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:47,330
way I can film in windy situations like

92
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,700
down by the pier in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Santa Monica which</font>

93
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,770
