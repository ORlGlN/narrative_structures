53
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,489
still and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often you get to see that</font>

54
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:26,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean that if you search them on</font>

55

really cool and I'm happy I was able to

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">retrieve at least some footage I've been</font>

59
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,110
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find a way to incorporate this</font>

60
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,670
into this vlog and I figured the best

61
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,019
way to incorporate is just to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

62
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,360
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight up and now you're probably</font>

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,910
wondering what I'm talking about um so a

64
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,410
way that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of youtubers make money</font>

65
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,380
is once you have a channel it's growing

66
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,549
bigger and everything that companies

67
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:54,250
will come to you and ask you to promote

68
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,560
their product or service and to be

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,299
completely honest I've gotten a number

70
00:03:58,299 --> 00:03:59,470
of those and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned them down</font>

71
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,870
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't support the product</font>

72
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,680
I don't use the product i don't i'm not

73
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,030
going to endorse it and tell you guys to

74
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,489
use it if I wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even use it myself</font>

75
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,130
but a company contacted me called

76
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,810
opinion outpost and I know you've heard

77
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of other youtubers talk about it</font>

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">but have they actually used it I don't</font>

79
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,988
know maybe all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know is I have because</font>

80
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:21,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was always the kid that was like</font>

81
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,690
searching on Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> how'd it make money</font>
