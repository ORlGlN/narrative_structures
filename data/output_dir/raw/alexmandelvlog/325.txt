112
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet I don't know I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's</font>

113
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,979

116
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,770
learned<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do it was probably early</font>

117
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,419
high school maybe you're something like

118
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:03,090
that when everyone's a pyro so I have a

119
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,169
lighter here<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously this involves</font>

120
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:11,669
fire so either do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> try this at home</font>

121
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:13,500
or if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to home</font>

122
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,340
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very safe and this is a</font>

123
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,349
specifically you want a lighter that has

124
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,550
a this adjustable knob on it let it

125
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,760
focus I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's get there we go</font>

126
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,190
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> positive or negative so it could be</font>

127
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,330
bigger so<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see it's not very</font>

128
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,199
high but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can push this and it gets</font>

129
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,080
higher still not super high but it's

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty high now watch this so we take</font>

131
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,470
this this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a metal cover that I</font>

132
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,970
can try to fit my nail under or

133
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,310
something you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use like it do your</font>

134
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,870
knife I'm obviously doing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard way</font>

135
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,650
but there once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it pops right off</font>

136
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,300
so now it's exposed and you could see

137
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,759
this mechanism here this little thing in

138
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the front that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could push</font>

139
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:10,979
back or fourth as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and that</font>

140
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,309
adjusts the size of the flame now you'll

141
00:06:14,309 --> 00:06:17,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice on here when it focuses there's a</font>

142
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:20,159
positive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a negative so the positive</font>

143
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,829
is obviously turning the knob that way

144
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:27,719
or in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my case counterclockwise but what</font>

145
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:31,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if I lift up this little knob it</font>

146
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:33,989
exposes that white thing below and what

147
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:37,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that white thing is is the gear that's</font>

148
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:40,860
that I'm it's like a screw so once this

149
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,209
goes all the way to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right to the</font>

150
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,969
highest flame I can lift this up above

151
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,969
that push it back to left and then lower

152
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:50,969

154
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:59,639
already I'm slowly unscrewing this thing

155
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,559

put us back on and squeeze it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it'll</font>

158
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,819
stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this flame should be much</font>

159
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:14,999
higher check this out it might take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

160
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:18,509

161
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:20,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">little dangerous don't unscrew it too</font>

162
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,110

167
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you let go because it's releasing a</font>

168
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,110
lot of fluid it can sometimes stay lit

169
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,110
don't let<font color="#E5E5E5"> it stay lit too long cuz any</font>
