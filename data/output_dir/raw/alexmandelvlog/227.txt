7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,029
kind of knew it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to come but I</font>

8
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,890
gotta go load up all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

9
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,289
trunk of my car when I sell this stuff I

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:31,470
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this stuff I got Pelican cases</font>

11

12
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,770
everything and this stuff is going in my

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,969
trunk yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is filled with girls today</font>

14
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:47,219
we're praising America before I head out

15
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:48,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ranch today I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

16
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,579
pick up some ammo as well and I'm

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,500
picking up some lead free ammo the

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,239
reason being is there's some wildlife

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,969
out that live just naturally around the

20
00:00:56,969 --> 00:00:59,309
ranch and I don't want to give them lead

21
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,870
poisoning answer that's a big problem

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,789
that that's out there and the another

23
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lead free MO is very</font>

24
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:08,909
expensive or it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expensive so</font>

25
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:11,340
this vlog really would not have been

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,740
