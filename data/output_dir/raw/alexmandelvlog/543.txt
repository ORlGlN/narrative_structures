36
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,380
up the wires sweet the wires are tied

37
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,450
down like on the inside here with the

38
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,070
electrical tape<font color="#E5E5E5"> electrical tape doesn't</font>

39
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,590
stick very well to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of metal as</font>

40
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:58,719
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it just peels up and a lot</font>

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,570
of them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already coming off so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

42
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,950
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use just a great duct</font>

43
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,750
tape i have so i went out i just bought

44
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,829
black duct tape so that i can clean up

45
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:14,410
the wires well so they can be hidden cuz

46
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,940
no one wants to see a whole mess of

47
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,430
wires just finish that everything's

48
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:21,070
working perfectly I actually rewired the

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">red because I made it so worked</font>

50
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,549
yesterday but it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a so i</font>

51
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,200
undid the wiring a little and fixed it

52
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,720
now that everything's good so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll see</font>

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,500
you watch it'll become red the bright

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,750
red all around works perfectly cleaned

55
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,819
up the wiring it's still exposed

56
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:41,290
obviously because it's a like a skeleton

57
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,200
shelf there's no hiding it but at least

58
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,140
if like from the front you can't see

59
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,910
anything and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside these things</font>

60
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,450
is if you notice this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a wiring</font>

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,400
on the inside and that runs all the way

62
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,340
down and then off to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side and then</font>

63
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,480
under so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can come up there this</font>

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">hidden is I'm going to get it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

65
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,830

if you haven't tried korean BBQ should

115
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:28,550
go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and the reason why it's great</font>

116
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,560
to at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment is because it's mainly</font>

117
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
like meat vegetables there's not a lot

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,720
of starches and it was he good rice but

119
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">I actually didn't have right so did on</font>
