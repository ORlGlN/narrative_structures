00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,860
in my last cruise blog you guys noticed

45
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was a little drunk and said some stuff</font>

46
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,299
regarding Jake that sparked a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

47
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:31,569
comments about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I love hatred and and</font>

48
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:34,599
mean comments towards Angela in

49
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,239
particular and you should clue them in

50
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,450
on just the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation uh so we had</font>

51
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,290
already broken up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know it's a my</font>

52
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,620
own personal life but bottom line guys I

53
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,450
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyberbullying and</font>

00:02:58,269 --> 00:02:59,579
because you're hurting people's feelings
