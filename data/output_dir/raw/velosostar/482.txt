54
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">nice appealing videos over this is a</font>

00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hindu wedding and Hindu wedding videos</font>

56
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,890

57
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,019
being all looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> lovey-dovey they want</font>

58
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,000
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> long video with full ceremony</font>

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,530
and everything it doesn't need to be

60
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,880
lovely w all I've got to do is be there

61
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a camera and film the whole thing</font>

62
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,200
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it together really easy to do</font>

63
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,180
not very fun but also i<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a lot of</font>

64
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">battery life so these little batteries</font>

65
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,470
here are the batteries that charge the

66
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,570
camera that i'm currently using right

67
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,600
now my sony a7s<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark two now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just</font>

68
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,430
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give away the iphone in today's</font>

69
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,859
vlog<font color="#CCCCCC"> and call it quits got some things I</font>

70
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:55,200
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you guys about as well</font>

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,060
but instead I thought I need to try and

72
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,980
modify these batteries to make them last

73
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,090
a little bit longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and modify this</font>

74
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,230
camera to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it last a little bit</font>

75
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,970
longer so I thought we'd do that in the

76
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,970
blog before I give away the phone let's

77
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,910
go to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> office</font>

78
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's derived at the office I can see a</font>

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
mental thing what's that<font color="#CCCCCC"> worried I have</font>

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,550

to leave you for today because today

82
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,630
it's all about this lights<font color="#CCCCCC"> camera these</font>

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,120
batteries suck does the plan right as I

84
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,680
told you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys I'm shooting this wedding</font>

85
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,110
tomorrow and it's a Hindu wedding so all

86
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,000
I need to do is turn up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just film</font>

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,350
the whole thing this camera needs to be

88
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,350
recording all day right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

89
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,580
record with this one as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so I've got</font>

90
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,290
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different angles they both use the</font>

91
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,660
same type of battery which again sucks

92
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,030
because these batteries suck I've got

93
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,760
five of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them this is the fifth one that</font>

94
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,459
