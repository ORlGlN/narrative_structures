bullies and well I can I suppose I can

like tell you guys like my my my sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

51
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,119
ways of dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this now talk</font>

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,360
talking about bullies I am 18 years of

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,189
age<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look it will come</font>

54
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,409
on to that a bit later but I'm 18 so I

55
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't been to school in a long time</font>

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,620
and

57
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,270
for my recollection the only time that

58
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,610
is ever really a bully is when you're at

59
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,380
school and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the only way to get</font>

60
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,590
rid<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bully is to either bully them</font>

61
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,430
back or just totally ignore them if you

62
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,770
bully them back you need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

63
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,240
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win and you're going to</font>

64
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,710
have better things to say to them than

65
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,900
they are to you and if you're not going

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to bully them and just and just totally</font>

67
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,510
and the other way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is totally</font>

68
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,060
ignore them so just literally don't see

69
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,250
anything back there they'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

70
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,500
and then give it a few more days and

71
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,670
they'll they won't do it anymore because

72
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">they won't get a reaction what they want</font>

73
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,580
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a reaction out of you they</font>

74
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,870
want you to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset they want you to be</font>

75
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,750
angry and I don't know why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

76
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,370
really know why people people people

77
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to go out their way to make other</font>

78
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,060
people upset and angry to get a

79
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,220
reactions kind of sad really however

80
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,990
yeah just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't react to it and then</font>

81
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:00,420
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> they won't do it again they</font>

82
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't do it again hopefully so that's</font>

83
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,150
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my best advice for bullies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and yeah</font>

84
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,370
other than that what's the other one

85
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,810
like content creators and stuff if

86
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:12,000
you're tryna if you're trying to this is

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,170
a thing right this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this is what</font>

88
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:16,320
I've learned right if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are someone</font>

89
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,700
who is a creative person so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

90
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,520
creative you create things so that might

91
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,950
be lets say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> photographer a graphics</font>

92
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,050
artist a video content creator like

93
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,080
myself if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you create something and you</font>

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,400
do it online and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud of that</font>

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,170
there's people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come to</font>

96
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,530
you and say I don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> your work and</font>

97
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason the reason is right the</font>

98
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,880
reason why<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do that it is because</font>

99
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're creative there's no right or</font>

100
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,080
wrong answer you got together in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

101
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,630
head there's no right or wrong answer

102
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:54,300
you can make a video about something and

103
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,130
there's no right or wrong way to make a

104
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,080
video there's no right or wrong that

105
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
cuts right or wrong there's no right or

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,610
wrong way to do that that's all it's

107
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,440
totally personal preference but the

108
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,680
thing is with YouTube is that you put

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,320
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video out or something and say if</font>

110
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,209
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't like it they will hate</font>

111
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:15,150
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where this is where hate has</font>

112
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,070
come in to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equation now how do you</font>

113
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with hey so say if you've done some</font>

114
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:20,358
work online

115
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:22,400
and someone is hating in the comment

116
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,169
section I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

117
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,460
not the hate that I get what do I get

118
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,259
I'm just twiddling this little thing

119
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:30,319
around what do I get I get apparently I

120
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,150
look like a monkey apparently apparently

121
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,759
everything i buy comes out of dad's

122
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,800
wallet or something apparently a

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,710
commonly think of it at the moment I've

124
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,240
got I've got like my videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> a I've</font>

125
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,560
got that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be unsuccessful</font>

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,800
and and to be fair like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

127
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,680
of hate that I get I find hilarious

128
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,139
because number one I hate in general

129
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,029
someone is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your video they've</font>

130
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,110
spent their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own time right they've come</font>

131
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">onto your video and they haven't liked</font>

132
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,379
it any normal person right in normal

133
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:04,460
person if you've gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a video right</font>

134
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,020
any normal person if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

135
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,090
video that you know they watch 30

136
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,590
seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think our this isn't very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

137
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:11,389
they click off it but no<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you not hate</font>

138
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:13,099
does what they do is to go down and

139
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,689
their waste even more of the time they

140
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,310
waste even more of the time they go into

141
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,590
the comments section<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they write all</font>

142
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,029
this guy looks like a oh my god

00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:22,250
oh and then they may be proceeded to

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,250
leave a dislike rating or whoever yeah

145
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,870
so but like the normal person would just

146
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,159
like click off it if I don't like a

147
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:29,569

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like Jesus Christ people are so</font>

165
00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:08,029
strange I why why do they do it and why

166
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,650
did I do it like I've got a friend got a

167
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,659
friend called Ryan Franklin and we we

168
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:13,250
always skype a lot and he did he does

169
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,879
YouTube as well and he's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

170
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">because he's a ginger guy and he's</font>

171
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,900
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying to me that how much Haiti</font>

172
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,430
gets for being like ginger and stuff and

173
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,620
we just laugh about it the thing is the

174
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,580
people the thing they don't understand

175
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,379
is that when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> write hate they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

176
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:28,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">they trying to give themselves a boost</font>

177
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,180
but in return they're not because number

178
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,100
one

179
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,500
they give me and people content<font color="#E5E5E5"> creators</font>

180
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,200
something to laugh about and they're

181
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">just sad lonely little people and that's</font>

182
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,670
the way it will be if someone hates what

183
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,550
you are doing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're below</font>

184
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,610
you in society they are below you no

185
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,080
one's going to say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone was above</font>

186
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,380
me in society say if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was safe it was</font>

187
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't know Lord Sugar or bloody Bill</font>

191
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,070
anyone below them are they because you

192
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,780
just don't hate on people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are below</font>

193
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,880
you if I see if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on to a YouTube</font>

194
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,650

197
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,090
only hate on someone if you physically

198
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,490
know and feel that they're above you and

199
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,960
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you that is the only reason</font>

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,570
someone someone would hate on you it's

201
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,520
the only reason like literally any

202
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,590
reason so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's how I deal with it</font>

220
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,710
they don't understand is that that video

221
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">was planned out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and thought for my</font>

222
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,710
actual audience and my audience actually

223
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,380
enjoyed it but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't for them but</font>

224
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,730
somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube put a lot of my videos</font>

227
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">brings in a lot of like negativity which</font>

228
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:17,170
is a shame really like the last episode
