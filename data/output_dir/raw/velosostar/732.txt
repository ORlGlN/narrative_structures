154
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,030
what happens is this one this one's

155
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,170
quite cooks it comes with these lenses

156
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,000
but you put an actual case on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,220
a physical case and then the lens screws

158
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,410
into the case so it's just going to stay

159
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,490
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not going to come off and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

160
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,690
can put my phone in my pocket I don't

161
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,010
have to worry about losing the actual

162
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,720
adapter now this one's pretty cool

163
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,340
someone put a review on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I</font>

164
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,720
will do a full review of its a probably

165
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,280
do something on tech flow by X is pretty

166
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,560
cool this is probably the lens i do so

167
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,410
that is the normal iphone and then

168
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:59,360
that's it a little bit wider if that

169
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,710
makes sense everything looks a little

170
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,870
bit more wide so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to use</font>
