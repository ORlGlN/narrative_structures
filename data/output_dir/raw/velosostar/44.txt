1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,260
Ohhhhhh!

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,660
Good! Good!

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:18,660
These are my favourite chocolate sweet ever.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,220
For those of you in the world who don't have
the blessing of having Cadbury's chocolate

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,699
in your local supermarket, this is a Cadbury's
Creme Egg and they come out once a year and

6
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,670
that's probably the reason that I like them.

7
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,490
They come out for one season and that is the
period up to Easter.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:42,720
And it's like this normal chocolate but this,
just, sugary inside that's just an amazing combo.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,180
And I still love Mars bars but Cadbury's Creme
Eggs - wooh!

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,740
They're something else!

11
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,140
Right, OK guys.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,980
9 AM in the office this morning, right.

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,420
I've got loads of work to do this morning
so I'm going to have to catch up with you

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,420
guys later.

15
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,870
I've got some, err, some wireless stuff to
be doing, some internet wireless stuff, and

16
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,070
I find it really fun and really, really entertaining
and just...

17
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,590
Well, this morning, I'm linking a house to
my house that is about 1.2 miles away, giving

18
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,940
them internet from my house.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,850
Do you not think that that's slightly mental?

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,700
I just love it.

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,700
I love it.

22
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,540
Need to get on with work.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,820
You see all of this stuff in, in the car?

24
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,820
Err, I've been doing wireless work all morning
and, err, I'm absolutely knackered.

25
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,060
I need to get all of this stuff in to 
the garage.

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,060
OK, I've, I've booked a hair-cut, OK.

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,979
I know it's getting mental - I'm having to
use hairspray to keep it up but, anyway guys,

28
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,679
good morning guys, how are we all doing?

29
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:57,609
My name is Alex and it's not even morning,
it's afternoon.

30
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,100
I've been working all morning, guys.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,110
I have been on roofs, I've been doing things,
I've got radios in the garage - loads of them

32
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:10,139
- I'm on a massive train at the moment trying
to overhaul my whole wireless network, upgrading

33
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,660
all of my radios and I've got the people coming
around to my house tomorrow to survey the

34
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,390
whole house so that we can get the lease line
installed.

35
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,500
And just to give you guys a frame of reference,
this is how much data, right now, is currently

36
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,830
being consumed on my whole wireless internet.

37
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:30,000
All of my clients put together, right now
- about 20 meg.

38
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey bro. MAN: Hey mate, you alright? ALEX: Yes, are you?

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
MAN: Yes, thanks. ALEX: Good.

40
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,700
So, Elliott said to me earlier: Alex, are
you..?

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,720
Oh, goodness.

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,620
Elliott asked me earlier, he said: Alex, are
you going to your office at any point today

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,041
and I replied with: Probably not because I've
spent the whole day working this morning and

44
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,380
I'm kind of knackered and I just want to stay
at home.

45
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,760
So, instead, Elliott's come to my house because
he wants to film something for, well, something

46
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,220
about uni. and he wants to get my opinion
on university for a video.

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,240
Right then, El, you got what you needed?

48
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,240
ELLIOTT: Absolutely, thank you very much.

49
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,240
ALEX: Did I do a good job?

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
ELLIOTT: You did a great job.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
ALEX: Alright then, bro, see in you in a bit.

52
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
ELLIOTT: Bye.

53
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
See you later.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,450
ALEX: Right then guys, we haven't talked about
this in quite some time and I think it's time

55
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:23,310
for a little bit of a, err, well, reminiscent
flashback to what I used to and, well, still

56
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,020
absolutely love but don't talk about anywhere
near as much as I used to and that was kind

57
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,220
of, well, my love for gaming.

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:37,900
But then, noticing, that, with gaming, you
have a gaming set up and then the actual plethora

59
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,260
of people around the words "gaming set up"
and how vast that was.

60
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:48,600
I think what I'm trying to say guys is that
this, this is where I started and I got set

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,680
up in here and I got it as I wanted it and
then I couldn't really improve it anymore

62
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,700
because this set up is now as I want it and
now I really have nothing more to vlog about

63
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,790
on this gaming set up stuff because, well,
my office is done and this is done and the

64
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,500
live streaming room, that's, well, I'm still
doing videos on that.

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,960
Hence why, guys, I've bought this new house
and it's literally right around the corner

66
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,900
now and I want to have a discussion about
how you think I should have the set up in

67
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
the new house.

68
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,670
Because I've done a triple monitor set up
now for the past three years and it's been,

69
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,280
well, it's been good - it's been cool.

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,770
But is this needed?

71
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,349
Or should we have more monitors?

72
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:30,889
Maybe three monitors down there and then three
up there or a big screen up there or...

73
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:34,540
Because guys, I know this is gorgeous man,
like, look at this...

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,400
Because guys, I think the problem is that,
back in the day guys, when I made this set

75
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,840
up, bigger and more was better.

76
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,110
Now, obviously I've told you guys that we're
going to be doing numerous different set ups

77
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,960
in the house - we're going to be having an
editing suite, we're going to have a whole

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,349
LAN room to do LAN gaming with you guys preferably
but I'm talking about my set up.

79
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:21,590
I want to hear from you guys in the comments
about what we should do and some of the ideas

80
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,550
that I pick, I'm going to personally invite
you round to the new house when it's finished.

81
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,469
I just really don't want to make a mistake
with it - I just want it to be absolutely

82
00:05:30,469 --> 00:05:32,650
incredible - insane.

83
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:36,380
Right, I've got a meal date with assistant.

84
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,420
OK, arrived at the office, guys.

85
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,960
That there says "Work Hard Anywhere."

86
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,340
OK, I'm kind of buzzing a little bit.

87
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:53,570
I kind of really want to see what the hell
Work Hard Anywhere have sent me.

88
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,240
It literally says it right there.

89
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,740
Work Hard Anywhere and it's got my logo on
it.

90
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
This is sick.

91
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
This is sick.

92
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,860
Check out how professional this is!

93
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,650
It's got my logo, Work Hard Anywhere.

94
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:05,190
Hey Alex, happy 2018 mate.

95
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:10,150
In this package you will find our new location
series T-shirt - a UK version in dark heather

96
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,310
just for you.

97
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,640
Also, you will find a working/not working
wristband.

98
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,180
It serves two purposes - listen to this.

99
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,629
When it's flipped to the working side it serves
as a reminder to focus on the tasks in hand

100
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:24,750
- it's work time.

101
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,849
It also prevents you from being disrupted.

102
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:32,480
The red band side notifies others that you're
in the zone and you do not want to be disturbed.

103
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
Sick!

104
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,160
That's sick!

105
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,340
You see this?

106
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,249
Look at this - that says: The joy is in creating.

107
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:42,760
And that T-shirt is sick.

108
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Wicked!

109
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,180
Right, so guys, all of you need to hold me
to this, right now, because, I'm going to

110
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:59,620
introduce you guys to the two plans that I
have right here and we have discussed these

111
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,420
before on, on the vlogs.

112
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,580
So, as you can see, this is the second floor
of the house, right.

113
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:13,870
And in this one, there's a wall here and not
a wall there and in this one, there's a wall

114
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,300
there and not a wall here.

115
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,050
So, the house actually comes with four bedrooms.

116
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,310
One, two, three and then another one, right.

117
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,620
I want to make it a two bedroom house and
merge two of the rooms in to one nice, big office.

118
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,800
I said to you guys that this one, a long one
down here, or this one, and the majority of

119
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,479
people said this one.

120
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,889
But I am still undecided as of yet.

121
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:41,680
But let's just plan this one because this
is what you guys wanted.

122
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,420
So guys, what I'm actually thinking here is
having my set up, my actual set up, my set

123
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:49,530
up, right about here.

124
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:54,719
So, this will be my set up on this wall between
these two windows.

125
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:59,830
And then what I was going to think of doing
is having an editing station over here with

126
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,809
a little bit of a cool set in this corner.

127
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:11,300
So, "E" for editing station, "S" for set,
"S" for set up and then over here, I wanted

128
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:18,699
a table which had two screens on it back to
back for a little bit of a LAN - a local area

129
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,300
network - so that when I have friends over,
we can come up here, we'll have, like, some

130
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,719
computers built, we can install Steam on them
and we can play PubG or anything we want.

131
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:32,179
Now, obviously, this is just the upstairs
of the house.

132
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:35,799
The downstairs of the house, which, unfortunately,
I don't have a plan for - the downstairs,

133
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:42,179
guys, of the house is going to hold the cinema
room and the live-eat area which is going

134
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,440
to have a nice, big, awesome thing with a
cool rug on it, loads of sofas, a nice, curved,

135
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,899
big screen and some nice speakers for listening
to music and watching things.

136
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:58,529
So, downstairs - cinema room and also the
relaxing area with a huge, normal TV, like,

137
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:00,760
65 inch curved or something.

138
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,760
Mental.

139
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,682
So, as usual, I need you guys's help, with
everything in my life - I always sort of need

140
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:07,190
help with everything I do.

141
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,690
Watch this - wait a minute.

142
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,800
Oooooh...

143
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,100
Yo guys, that's where I'm going to end today's
video, right here.

144
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,100
I do hope you enjoyed it.

145
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,570
I put this jumper on - perhaps you're thinking:
Alex, why have you got that jumper on for?

146
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,550
It's because I didn't want to wear my big
coat in the house but it's, it's kind of cold

147
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,149
in here because the heating's just turned
off because now it's kind of late and, err,

148
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:26,601
you're probably thinking: Alex, why are you
shouting?

149
00:09:26,601 --> 00:09:27,660
Are you not waking everybody up?

150
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,920
Well, no, nobody's living here at the moment.

151
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,440
It's just kind of me, so, err...

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,872
Oh, and Burt - how are you doing bro?

153
00:09:33,872 --> 00:09:37,699
Guys, if you enjoyed today's daily vlog - I
sure as hell did enjoy putting it together

154
00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:42,120
- a like rating guys would be wicked but for
now my name's been Alex, you guys have been

155
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,400
awesome - guys stay awesome and keep smiling
and I'll see you in tomorrow's daily vlog.

156
00:09:46,860 --> 00:00:00,000
Adios.
