clearing out is technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing stuff</font>

70
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,610
and it's something that needs to be done

71
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,740
but I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean it out to get</font>

72
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,990
something else done if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes sense</font>

73
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,700
