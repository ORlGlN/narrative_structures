myself have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> like legitimately</font>

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,750
confused as to what I'm doing with my

17
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,700
life at the moment believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or not</font>

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,469
like I come across as some sort of guy

19
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,300
that knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's doing and</font>

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,850
everything but like in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last sort of</font>

21
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,129
month I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of get my</font>

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,129
life for the next sort of year on track

23
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:55,140
and put a plan together because my brain

24
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,020
doesn't work without a plan but I've

25
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,579
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put two and two together and I</font>

26
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,730
thought I'm sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said to myself look</font>

27
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,349
sometimes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> life you don't have to have</font>

28
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">a plan thing easy to just go with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,610
flight it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a plan don't</font>

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">get me wrong but sometimes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just need</font>

31
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,549
to go with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan</font>

32
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i put together so far this is my</font>

33
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,330
guidelines right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what's going</font>

34
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">down for well my youtube channels as of</font>

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,710
now and the next year so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all started</font>

36
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,799
out just before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i started recording the</font>

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
gaming den series right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,000
series on my channel and then I thought

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,119
to myself my main channel mars bar it's

40
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,790
so like it's so diverse like we do so

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,040
much different different stuff it's all

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,750
like sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of technology related that's</font>

43
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,329
because like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like technology</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i</font>

44
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:46,920
just i love it i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely</font>

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,729
awesome and but like i've just i've been

46
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,470
i've been really struggling myself as

47
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person that makes these videos i</font>

48
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,939
have been struggling personally to put

49
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,439
to put a pin in what my channels are

50
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,329
like like and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't differentiate</font>

51
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,729
what they are you guys are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

52
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:07,049
about to differentiate what they are

53
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,209
what they're about which means it's

54
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,739
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to</font>

55
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,660
decide whether they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> subscribe or</font>

56
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,590
not or

57
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,670
you get what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean because they're like</font>

58
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,810
what I don't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

59
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,000
subscribing to the content is is so

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,360
diverse but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll put a plan together</font>

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I put a plan together now this is</font>

pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going back to how it</font>

69
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,160
was about two months ago maybe three

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,739
months ago pretty much what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did is if</font>

moment which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ridiculous and I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

77
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,640
killing myself because I've been only
