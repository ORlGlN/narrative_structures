46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,750
was pondering on this for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> while right</font>

47
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,420
and it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> across to me that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

48
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,360
a pub being sold in Newark it big on

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,680
