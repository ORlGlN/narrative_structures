like the most annoying<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing ever but</font>

114
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,260
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way to deal with it is to</font>

115
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,170
use uncopyrighted music so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

116
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">do to help you guys out is if you guys</font>

117
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,810
are content creators one going to do is

118
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,390
down in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the description box</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font>

119
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,670
drop a few YouTube channels that upload

120
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:18,010
copyrighted free music and I'm also

121
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:20,260
right I'm also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drop you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys a</font>

122
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,790
link and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only recently found about</font>

123
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,320
this I'm also going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> rip you guys a</font>

124
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,990
link to a YouTube checker so what you

125
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do with the YouTube checker is put</font>

126
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,590
the song<font color="#CCCCCC"> name in the YouTube checker and</font>

127
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,810
it will tell you if it's copyrighted now

128
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,330
the service<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only in beta so sometimes</font>

129
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,500
it might not work sometimes I'll say

130
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,729
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not copyrighted you'll upload it</font>

131
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,410
and then get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a copyright strike but</font>

132
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,120
that's problem number two is copyright

133
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,320
the only way to use it is use free

134
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:45,130
copyright music free unpop drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> music</font>

135
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:47,140
rather and check it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> you upload it</font>

136
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,729
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll drop those links in the</font>

137
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:50,530
description to some free music services

138
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,250
wind go away and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube song</font>

139
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,710
copyright checker<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right I'm finally</font>

140
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,870
just home now so hopefully the wind

141
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,950
shouldn't be a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so yeah guys</font>

142
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,140
like number two is copyright number

143
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,700
three number three is internet right I

144
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,950
have a major problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right</font>

145
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,840
because you can probably tell I just

146
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,300
been like<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking around outside and</font>

147
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,729
I've been walking around quite close to

148
00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:20,919
my house and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i live in</font>

149
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle of absolutely nowhere so</font>

150
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,310
getting into that is really really

151
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult we actually use a service at</font>

152
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,300
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a wireless service</font>

153
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,590
there's actually a box on top of my

154
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,720
house<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now that's beaming over to a</font>

155
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,330
tower which is giving off internet so a

156
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,430
box on my house communicates about four

157
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,130
miles away to another box<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's on top</font>

158
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a tower like</font>

159
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,590
a big mast and that's how we get

160
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,090
internet over to our house but whenever

161
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,930
it rains or it gets interference<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

162
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,150
internet goes really slowly and really

163
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,220
horrible and especially our every single

164
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,500
day between like four o'clock and ten

165
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,139
o'clock like peak times it's like

166
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">ridiculous cannot upload you can't watch</font>

167
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,120
anything it's ridiculous sometimes I

168
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,850
have to go on 3g on my phone 22 uploads

169
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:06,020
were supposed to fairly lucky that I get

170
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,590
3g coverage and at this house we have

171
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,970
another problem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube like</font>

172
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,970
internet like 4k is now coming and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

173
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,280
my connection sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carlo 480 and</font>

174
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">uploading if your content creator like</font>

175
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,130
you need a good connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upload</font>

176
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">videos again there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no way around it so</font>

177
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,979
yeah but other than that I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

178
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:27,979
think of any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beauty problems maybe</font>

179
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:31,280
if they included a feedback system on on

180
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,220
the videos will likely change the whole

181
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,860
like rating and in the comment section

182
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,830
so that what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd have to do is if you</font>

183
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,099
put a like rating on a video you'd have

184
00:06:43,099 --> 00:06:45,260
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment and say why you liked the</font>

185
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,870
video or if you put a dislike rating on

186
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,580
you'd have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment and say why you</font>

187
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,340
dislike the video and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

188
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,810
don't know if that would work or not I

189
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know I honestly don't know I'm</font>

194
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,550

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,430
what happens but<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet those are some like</font>
