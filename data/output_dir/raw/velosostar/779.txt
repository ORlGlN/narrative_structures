86
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,709
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all butthurt about it a lot of</font>

87
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:52,060
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very young and you don't</font>

88
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,670
understand how the world works when you

89
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,320
grow up or when you become a door 18

90
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,959
years of age and theoretically when

91
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,760
you're 18 you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't move out of your</font>

92
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,390
parents

93
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,710
house but no I want to stay in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

94
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,640
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be going to</font>

95
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,860
university and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> university that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

96
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to is really close to where I live</font>

97
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,709
so what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point in me moving</font>

98
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:10,660
out what I'm going to do is pay my dad

99
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,350
rent so I actually pay my dad to live in

100
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,620
his house so my dad asks money from me

101
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,660
to live in his house right and the

102
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,030
reason he does that is because I earn

103
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,400
over a certain amount of money so let me

104
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">go over what i do to earn my money and</font>

105
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,850
how I earn everything so tell you what

106
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">mommy and daddy don't pay for jack shit</font>

107
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,210
for a start my mom and dad<font color="#E5E5E5"> have split up</font>

108
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comment makes no sense anyway I</font>

109
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,930

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,930
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand I just don't I</font>

213
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,930
can't get my<font color="#E5E5E5"> head around some people</font>

214
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,919
no obviously are you agree there was a

215
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,650
guy in that video called Adam and he's

216
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,910
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my best mates he's an absolute</font>

217
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,000
legend he's so funny but he just<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font>

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is without him he just</font>

219
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,520
constantly takes the pits like

220
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,549

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,169
of my way is like 25 quid like I think

224
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:42,520
everyone just took Adam the wrong way

225
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,440

226
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">when two dislikes on the video the two</font>
