<font color="#CCCCCC">and and i'm an owner of them i invested</font>

46
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,920
in them because number one I got them

47
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,390
for less than half price so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted</font>

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,420
to sell them I could I could get like

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,740
more money for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I bought them for I</font>

50

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,620
i could sell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ebay for</font>

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,450
closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight hundred I don't</font>

54
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,980
understand why they why they were why

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,159
they were why they were so cheap but

56
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,569
they they a hundred percent work they're

57
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:23,250

71
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> last vlogs on the vlog channel</font>

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,000
price yv it why have you invested into a

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,859
discontinued product well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

77
00:02:55,859 --> 00:02:57,090
better now that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just continued</font>

78
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:00,060
right for the one reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's</font>

79
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,519
discontinued and and Google don't make

80
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,799
make apps for it anymore it's now open

81
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,870
to developers so now is the developers

82
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,060
opportunity to really smash on with

83
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,349
Google glass and see what they can

84
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:12,329
create now there's apps maps that you

say<font color="#E5E5E5"> in apps you can hear you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can live</font>

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,260
stream from these things you can

87
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,150
genuinely live stream from these things

88
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:20,609

89
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:23,040
