37
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to the video manager which</font>

38
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,940
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there as you can see I've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

39
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,710
two videos on here now the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

40
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,180
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just focus on this one right now</font>

41
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,460
it says let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know if this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

42
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,920
through two sub boxes now if I click on

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">this video</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just pause it and scroll down</font>

44
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">here pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying no no</font>

45
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,840
it doesn't know it didn't come to mind

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,430
noting comments or box don't come to

47
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,290
subscription so you guys get the point

48
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,170
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't come through to your guys</font>

49
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,970
subscription boxes the video physically

50
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,260
doesn't come through to your guy

51
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,730
subscription boxes so what's the point

52
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">in uploading to youtube and getting</font>

53
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,730
subscribers if the videos aren't going

54
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,530
to go to subscription boxes and the

55
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,670
reason I can back this up is because

56
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,500
when you're in the video manager<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

57
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,690
can see I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two videos here Ivy go</font>

58
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,670
along<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this side we've got this little</font>

59
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,500
bit of information here now these light

60
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,180
up green if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting money from</font>

61
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,590
your videos which at the moment I'm not

62
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,700

63
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,200

64
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,910

65
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,380
grace I'm not earning any money<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

66

<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube don't send videos to</font>

184
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,729

laugh or something are they genuinely

186
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:32,630
