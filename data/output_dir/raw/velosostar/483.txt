want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to look at what goes on</font>

174
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,450
in the background and say wow instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

175

190
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,430
can see a large chunk of this room right

191
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,440
here is taken over by my home's network

192
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,180
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a networking fanatic my network</font>

193

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networking however I'm gonna replace</font>

195
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,760
this with a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> grade router when</font>

196
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,380
we do all of this but what I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

197
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,910
all this networking gear<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all of</font>

198
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,470
these cables on have them mounted

199
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,690
vertically on the wall and all the

200
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,789
cables I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have them tacked to the</font>

201
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,669
wall in like going like this and then

202
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,929
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> go exactly where they need to be</font>

203
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:39,190
and then they have a little label on

204
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:39,809
them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

205
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,299
this cable goes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fit a little dirt and</font>

206
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,590
that makes things<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy to</font>

207
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,360
troubleshoot and it'll also look really

208
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,220
cool so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network moving down</font>

234
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,960
cables in cable trunking so you can't
