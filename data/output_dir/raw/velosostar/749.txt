do it well it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hard work</font>

79
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,489
because nothing in life is easy that's

80
00:02:42,489 --> 00:02:43,510
the first thing you gotta understand

81
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,849
life of life is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life will</font>

82
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,510
give you right you sat down and you

83
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,370
want to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> right what you can</font>

84
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,840
do is you can carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> on doing it you can</font>

85
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,639
battle through all the crap and feel

86
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,620
amazing when it's done right that's

87
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,239
option number one option what the hell

88
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,480
is under my eye I have no Abbott really

89
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,819
hurt what's the cut myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah or</font>

90
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">option number two is is to stay sat down</font>

91
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:12,099
and say I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this anymore and</font>

92
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,299
stay sat down and get all depressed

93
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,099
because you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to do like</font>

94
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,750
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the most ridiculous thing</font>

95
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,430
ever why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you why would you get</font>

96
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,340
white<font color="#E5E5E5"> why ask yourself why like just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

97
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,049
thing is what a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

98
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:24,699
so simple as well what a lot of people

99
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,419
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is ask themselves why like</font>

100
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,759
you just speak to yourself because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

101
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,989
you're when you're deciding something

102
00:03:31,989 --> 00:03:33,639
it's your brain that's deciding

103
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,349
something right and sometimes your brain

104
00:03:35,349 --> 00:03:36,909
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get confused and it can get all</font>

105
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:37,930
confused and everything could go a

106
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,400
little bit mental and your brain can say

107
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,870
oh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most stupid idea ever i'm</font>

108
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,009
just going to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> up i don't want to do</font>

109
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,019
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are hating on me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font>

110
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:45,579
getting along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my colleagues bloody</font>

111
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:47,500
better blah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working out your</font>

112
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,120
brain can say about and it can block out

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,739
all the positive stuff right sometimes

114
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,269
you sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't it's easier to</font>

115
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:53,500
think about mega tits easy to think

116
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,060
about negative stuff it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

117
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,040
positively you've got to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it</font>

118
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,900
right you gotta try and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

119
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,759
it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as like</font>

120
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,579
and the same was like being lazy like

121
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,759
it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do nothing so it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> natural</font>

122
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,739
to take that route it's natural<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

123
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,509
that path down like life<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do nothing</font>

124
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:12,759
but if you really really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

125
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,829
if you really really want something you

126
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,108
won't give up you obviously don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

127
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:19,690
the end goal enough like oh let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font>

128
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,978
let me try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about saying that</font>

129
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,779
I'm doing here what am I trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

130
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:25,090
what am I try see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really have</font>

131
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,350
any any like any

132
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,760
goals at the moment anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can sort</font>

133
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tell you guys like my main goal is to</font>

134
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,750
entertain people on the internet and

135
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,030
from what I can see and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people but</font>

136
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,980
what I can see I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to my best</font>

137
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,090
the best of my ability I'm gonna swap

138
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,500
hands X this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hurting then how</font>

139
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,420
can how can do this to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I have</font>

140
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,280
to have the blog blog like that is

141
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,290
upside down there we go to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

142
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,460
is fine it's fine it's fine it's fine

143
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,060
don't worry yeah so back back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on topic</font>

144
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,390
literally topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes it's so</font>

145
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,040
obviously when you're doing something

146
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,630
there's always going to be an end goal

147
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,800
because if there's not an end goal

148
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,500
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in doing it right and</font>

149
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,610
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give up you're obviously</font>

150
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">not ambitious enough to go after that</font>

151
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,420
