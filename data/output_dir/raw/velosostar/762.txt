56
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,520
is because today's topic is confident

57
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,160
and a pretzel or have you say his name

58
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,500
is that confidence above a camera but

59
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,640
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to change that I'm change it</font>

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,540
slightly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

61
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,850
confidence in general right it's

62
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,230
confidence in front of a camera is easy

63
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,300
confidence in generals the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard thing</font>

64
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,040
right so confidence with actual people

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,860

68
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,290
confident to do that that you don't need

69
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,730
confidence for that what any confidence

70
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,470

95
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,140
like general not a confident person but

96
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,970
the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is the easiest way to</font>

97
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,980
deal with confidence is to put a front

98
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">time because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can be the most</font>

99
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,859
unconfident person right you can write

100
00:03:32,859 --> 00:03:34,510
listen to this you can be the most

101
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,340

102
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,280
be unconfident you can be like I am but

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,079
you can also put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a front time you can</font>

104
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,760
act confident you can set you can add

105
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,959
come across you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can add so you can see I</font>

106
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:45,850
know this i know that lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> block I can</font>

107
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,319
do this I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a foot I've got six</font>

108
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:48,730
help I can do this I can do that I'm

109
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">super confident no one can tell the</font>

110
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,569
difference if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a confident front</font>

111
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,510
on no one knows no one knows the deep

112
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:57,140
down you're under confident

113
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,400
I see some of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube comments and</font>

114
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,569
some of them saying Alex<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like</font>

115
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,130
you're far too confident well how are

116
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,870
you so confident and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like i'm really</font>

117
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:06,050
not i'm really not honestly I'm shy so

118
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,810
if why do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not think I've got a</font>

119
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,430
girlfriend because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

120
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,020
confident that it but it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> legit</font>

121
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,640
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I knew there are obviously</font>

122
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,570
reason is because I don't want one

123
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I work way too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just will</font>

124
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">go spend time with a girl but do the</font>

125
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:19,880
main reasons i'm just not a confident

126
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,738
person i might just really not confident

127
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,050
like just I'm just not like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

128
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,550
thing that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a thing I've got like</font>

129
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not confident and it's really</font>

130
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,240
horrible but if you put front on no one

131
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a difference no one knows the</font>

132
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,450
difference honestly I thought that's

133
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're literally the only thing only</font>

134
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,110
