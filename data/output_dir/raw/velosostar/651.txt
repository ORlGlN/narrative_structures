something is perspective now perspective

69
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,560
is something that everyone needs and if

70
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,810
you don't have a strong perspective your

71
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,970
life and things in your life can really

72

suck let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain a little bit i'm</font>

73
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,290
going to use a real life example of

74
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,790
something that's happened to me today

75
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,550

76
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,320

79
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,290
either stay in this stable job where I

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:20,839
am at the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> or I can go to uni in</font>

September it's like a three year long

83
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,570
thing that people do I'm sure you ought

84
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,550
surely<font color="#E5E5E5"> your neural units then she was</font>

85
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:30,560
genuinely really getting quite upset

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,140
that she does know what to do and it was

87
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,270
a major issue for her and<font color="#CCCCCC"> she was</font>

88
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,560
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> really stressed out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and</font>

89
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,210
she was letting it ruin her evening I

<font color="#E5E5E5">chaos that number one don't lay ruin</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your evening because what's the point in</font>

92
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,450
letting something ruin your evening that

93
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,830
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even a living thing what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,600
point there's no product if a problem

95
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no such thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as problems right</font>

96
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,170
problems that exist if you can calculate

97
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">something it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem yeah if</font>

98
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,560
that makes sense that's what I always

99
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
say to myself if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can physically</font>

100
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,130
calculate something work out it's not

101
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,380
classed as a problem in my books so

102
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,240
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I said to her was look</font>

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,500
most people most people would absolutely

104
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,830
kill to have a stable job where they've

105
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,870
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stable income and the happy and</font>

106
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,180
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would also kill to have the</font>

107
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,670
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to university</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

108
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:19,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">number one be accepted into universities</font>

109
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,940
because you have to go through an

110
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,220
interview to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into uni so this girl</font>

113
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,530
University that she wants to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into</font>

114
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and she's also got a stable job and</font>

115
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,770
she's in a dialogue because she doesn't

116
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,750
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do and I said look look at</font>

117
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,940
it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at it from a</font>

118
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,970
different perspective I said yes you can

119
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,440
either complain and say you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

120
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,460
what to do you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this horrible</font>

121
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,320
choice to make or you can say actually

122
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">no</font>

123
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,830
I'm actually really quite fortunate I

124
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,720
mean position at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment where I've</font>

125
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a stable job and I'm happening with</font>

126
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,000
myself and I've also got the opportunity

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,790
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uni so I told her this also</font>

128
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,430
look at it from a different perspective

129
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,680
she did just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and her whole opinion</font>

130
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,480
changed on the matter in a matter of

131
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,850
five minutes she went<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being a total</font>

132
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,510
mess in the head almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to tears</font>

133
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,020
to actually thinking hell yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

134
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,690
really well and III III know what to do

135
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,100
and everything's fine i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

136
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,570
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously can't like my videos</font>

137
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,760
properly the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i always say write is</font>

138
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,400
you can't change life but you can change

139
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,130
your perspective the way you view life

140
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,260
is your interpretation of it you have

141
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the choice to view it in a negative way</font>

142
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,520
or a positive way you have a choice to

143
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,390
look at the positives or the negatives

144
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:38,270
of any given<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation and how you</font>

145
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,730
choose to do that is totally your choice

146
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,800
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> next time you're feeling down and</font>

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,020
you're feeling upset just realize that

148
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's your choice you're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

149
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,640
yourself you have the choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

150
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,410
the positives and think wait a minute

151
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,400
let's stop this let's figure it out

152
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,930
that's what perspective is yo guys we

153
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,520
just had a shower and a change of

154
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,380
clothes while we get interrupted by my

155
