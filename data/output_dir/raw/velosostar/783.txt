internet just isn't good enough at the

85
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,650
moment like i can i'll do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> speedtest</font>

86
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll do a live speed test right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,760
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that if i can now i can't i</font>

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,680
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> because i'm uploading i'm</font>

89
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,090
uploading it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> cities got 10 minutes</font>

90
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,680
remaining a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carlos free test the</font>

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,090
positive speed test I would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

92
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:27,290
about 80 ping 80 ping which is bad i'll

93
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,080
probably get 20 meg down and about 5

94
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
mega which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys like yeah alex you</font>

95
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,260
can stream on them no you can't because

96
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,330
that's probably the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best it would be but</font>

97
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,430
sometimes the upload dropped to like one

98
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,960
meg and then the stream will then

99
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,390
stutter so I've phoned up my internet

100
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,410
people and they said it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

101
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:44,420
sorted<font color="#E5E5E5"> out within the next one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a</font>

102
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,190
half weeks so give it one on a half

103
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,830
weeks and i 100% and definitely be

104
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,830
streaming so that's an update to the to

105
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,850
be streaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get straight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

106
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,530
screaming every night<font color="#CCCCCC"> i did do a test</font>

107
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,790
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my green screen you guys know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

108
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,010
a green the greatest one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

109
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,320
screams is very green down there and it

110
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,850
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks just a little rubbish like I</font>

111
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,670
prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I prefer to have like I prefer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

112
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,170
just not have a green screening because

113
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,610
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more character to the</font>

114
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,200
live stream if you get what I mean like

115
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,150
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a Grinch Grinch people</font>

116
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,440
can I get a feel for the surroundings

117
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,830
and stuff so yeah other than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

118
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,899
sort of worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about my subscriber</font>

119
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,238
count in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way but I just be</font>

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,610
