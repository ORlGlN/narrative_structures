and then i gotta i gotta be in french

43
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,579
and then because you had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do either</font>

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:46,020
French or Spanish I don't know what I

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,430
didn't do Spanish to French for some

46
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,840
bizarre reason anyway I got a being that

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,700

50
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,810
in drama which really annoyed me because

51
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,160
I thought I was good at drum I thought

52
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,090
was good acting

53
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,459
I'm an actor but obviously you know I've

54
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,780
gotta be and I was quite disappointed

55
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,819
but I got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> results that I needed to</font>

56
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,640

life and if I do well at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm going</font>

66
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a good job and that is not not</font>

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case at all I know many successful</font>

68
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,440
people that have earned a lot and

69
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,160
absolutely awesome living and you know

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,290
they dropped out of school the actual

71
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:01,799
dropouts like 12 name would be what's

72
00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:04,620
the guy invented<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft ok Bill Gates</font>

73
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,629
he dropped out of college he was a

74
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:08,610
college dropout and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> invented</font>

75
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,829
Microsoft so just just think just let

76
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:13,290
that sink in for a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so exam</font>

77
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,970
results are they're important but

78
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,100
they're not as important as people make

79
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,750
them out to be like people make them out

80
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,160
to be important because people want that

81
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,840
people want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do your best and you</font>

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,239
do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your best it's always good</font>

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,700
to do your best in exams because it gets

84
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,560
you prepared for life I don't think of

85
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,510
an exams as I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do my best to</font>

86
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,430
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get a good result I say to</font>

87
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,230
myself I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do my best in an exam</font>

88
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,769
because I want it to give me a good

89
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:39,540
skill set to do well<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other things</font>

90
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do in the future</font>

91
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,930
if you can do well at something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

92
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,150
don't want to do that being exams then

93
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,609
just think about how well you do is

94
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:49,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you do want to do for</font>

95
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,510
example so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do youtube if</font>

96
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,639
I could do one in an exam I can and I

97
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,650
don't want to do it I can definitely do

98
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,329
well in<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube because I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it</font>

99
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:58,859
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I mean like hopefully that</font>

100
00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:00,180
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense Rob yeah</font>

101
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,440
yeah so like they're not the be-all and

102
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,810
end-all do not my exams like ruin ruin

103
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weekend or obviously I prepared</font>

104
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">for my exams it's always good to prepare</font>

105
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,680
you don't want to go sit in an exam and

106
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,410
and just flunk it because you'll just

107
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,509
feel afterwards honestly do some

108
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,150
preparation prepare as much as you think

109
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,770
not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone else thinks as much as</font>

110
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,600
you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should prepare for the</font>

111
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,940
exam to get the result that you need not

112
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:31,240
want the result that you need and the

113
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,280
result you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get will be will be a</font>

114
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,840
reflection of your efforts that you put

115
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,669
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with now I'm not I'm not like a</font>

116
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:38,410
very intelligent person I can't spell

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,530
I'm quite stupid but I've managed at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

121
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,099
age of 18 to set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> my own business and</font>

122
00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:53,349
working i work for numerous bars and

123
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,900
companies i work for kitchen designers

124
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,090
we've got a company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

125
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,740

<font color="#E5E5E5">just i'm not clever at all why it's just</font>

128
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,910
all about like drive and persuasion and

129
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,130
this is what exams are about like if one

130
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,210
saying is if you can have the drive to

131
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,830
do an exam that you don't want to do

132
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,930
imagine the drive that you can put into

133
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,430
setting your business about something

134
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,870
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do maybe your passion</font>

135
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,940
is let's take my own for instance like

136
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,289
videography like we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

137
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">like with cameras if I you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I've</font>

138
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,220
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've got the drive to do</font>

139
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,650
something I want to do then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

140
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,050
win it's all about drive and if you can

141
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,330
do an exam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do well in it then you've</font>

142
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,789
got the drive to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing things and</font>

143
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:35,919
that is the be-all and end-all of it and

144
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,210
it you know if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good result</font>

145
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,830
you'll feel happy when I got the results

146
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">I felt happy about us off when I think</font>

147
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,190
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> resort I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was like I've let myself</font>

148
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:44,500
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly you can't go back with</font>

149
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
exams you can't like jacana<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schwein time</font>

150
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,550
once you've got the result that's it so

151
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,099
do your best and that's literally all

152
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:53,500
you can say just<font color="#CCCCCC"> lie your way through so</font>

153
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,139
we can reset them but yeah it's like

154
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:58,330
training young it's just a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a bore</font>

155
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,639
