charge so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy that's actually</font>

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,209
charging it instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of putting it on the</font>

62
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">tree which was over there I'm putting it</font>

63
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,109
up on the roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's a little bit</font>

66
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,480
main test is to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that solar panel</font>
