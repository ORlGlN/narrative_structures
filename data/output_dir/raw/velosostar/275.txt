1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,280
Woah.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,920
It's so hot.

3
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,200
Five minutes.

4
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,020
Five minutes, I think.

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,900
Five...

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,080
No, two minutes.

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,180
Two minutes until I need to be downstairs
in the hotel lobby for a welcome speech.

8
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,719
So today, guys, is the Sony Xperia launch
and there's a lot of people here - a lot of

9
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:50,730
those people... One of those including me and my
ugly face.

10
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,100
And I'm in group one, apparently, and this
is my agenda for today.

11
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,380
So it's going to be really fun.

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,820
So, this, here, is the lobby of the hotel.

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,630
There's a man that's in the middle right now, speaking, that I should really be listening to and everybody's

14
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:13,480
listening to him and he's talking about the
new Sony phone.

15
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,000
This is going to be interesting.

16
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,060
I've also just had to sign my life away.

17
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,800
Hopefully, we're going to get up to some cool
stuff.

18
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,680
OK, so, I'm, I'm group one so, I'm following, I'm following
the group one sign.

19
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,380
WOMAN: My name is Sophia and she is Hannah.

20
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,460
We are going to help you with everything and
spend the rest of the day with you.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,900
ALEX: Wait a minute, I think I'm getting a
phone.

22
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,200
Thank you very much. WOMAN: You're welcome.

23
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,180
MAN WITH MICROPHONE: You get the idea. Let's get you all in to position

24
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,560
and make sure that everybody knows how to work the camera.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,440
ALEX: So, from what I can understand, this
girl in the middle is going to be dancing

26
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:59,020
and smashing her fists through these glass
panes whilst we record it in 960 FPS on these phones.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,500
MAN WITH MICROPHONE: Could I have number 8
phone as well, please?

28
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,420
OK, so I'd like everyone to make sure that
they're rolling in super slow motion mode.

29
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,280
ALEX: That was so cool.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,069
I'm not 100% sure what's happening on this
one but I've got the phone back again and

31
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:26,880
there's all of this here.

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,500
And I'm assuming we're going to click and record on the 960 FPS when something happens

33
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,379
at each of these boards and then we're going
to get the footage from our phones with the

34
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,520
number on them at the end of the day.

35
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,620
ALEX: That is going to look so cool in 960.

36
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,300
So, that was the first part of the morning
over and done with.

37
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:02,120
Got to mess about with the 960 FPS capability
of the new phone.

38
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,019
Now, we've got to go and do something else.

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm not really sure what that is, though.

40
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,600
OK, so this is what's been opened up next,
right.

41
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,270
It's a massive show room in here.

42
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:17,790
I've come over to this bit with the TV, PS4
pro and here is the new Sony phone, right.

43
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,299
And you can play Playstation on the phones.

44
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,580
So, what is, whatever's on the screen is also
being played on the phone as well, streaming...

45
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,580
How?

46
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,520
Tsh!

47
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,460
MAN: Thanks mate. ALEX: Sweet man, no worries.

48
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,600
Nice to meet you.

49
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,980
So, I've nipped down to the beach, I've got
the phone in my hand now.

50
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,910
Not really 100% sure how I can show you guys
being at the beach - I'm not sure how that

51
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,480
changes anything, other than taking a few
photos, so I'll nip on to the photo mode now.

52
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,390
I hope I can get these photos off the phone.

53
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:52,810
But, here you go - 3, 2, 1...

54
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,019
That's a photo of my camera using the back
camera and then I'll swap the camera around

55
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,580
and take a selfie.

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,380
There you go.

57
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,920
But what about video, Alex?

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,520
What's the 4K video like?

59
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,320
Well...

60
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,220
What about that for 4K video?

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,800
Oooh - there's people coming.

62
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,140
<MAN IN BACKGROUND LAUGHS AND ALEX CHUCKLES> MAN: How did you do it?

63
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,320
ALEX: I'll tell you what,
boys and girls.

64
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,240
I'll bet you've never seen a high heel before
that's made out of pots and pans.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,020
Look at how mad that is!

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,720
What the?

67
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,680
Sony - thanks for the headphones.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
Ooh - they've got noise cancelling.

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,360
£179 down from £250.

70
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,180
£329 - I know who's the clear winner there!

71
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,100
Sony - insane.

72
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,780
That's just really surprised me and annoyed
me because the Bose are so much more expensive.

73
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,780
That's wicked.

74
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,390
So, this morning has been absolutely incredible.

75
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,810
I've got to play with the brand new phone
that's not even out yet, test out its slo-mo

76
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,650
with people punching through glass and
jumping through plasterboard... styrofoam.

77
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,770
And then I went to go and have a walk on the
beach and play with the phone and right in

78
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:39,350
this big hall thing, where they were, where
I could play a game on the phone from a Playstation

79
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,490
4 Pro and do loads of other cool stuff.

80
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:45,700
And now, I've been told to meet downstairs
in the lobby at 6 PM.

81
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:50,960
They also gave me the ZX Premium as well which
I have right here.

82
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,280
Right, let's head.

83
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,280
So, this is where Sony have brought me for
the rest of the day to look at the sunset

84
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,370
which is just behind me.

85
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,700
How incredible...

86
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
...Is that?

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,440
OK, so I've got the three phones here.

88
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,320
I've got the Sony phone, the Google phone
and the iPhone and you guys can be the judge

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,740
of which one you like best.

90
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,040
So, first up, we've got the Google Pixel.

91
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,120
There we go.

92
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,940
Next up, we've got the iPhone 7 Plus.

93
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,560
And then next, we've got the Sony.

94
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,780
There we go.

95
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:36,840
You guys judge, in the comments, what was
best.

96
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,301
What one takes the best photo?

97
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,940
In your opinion, looking at those?

98
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,240
MIDDLE MAN: iPhone.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
ALEX: The iPhone.

100
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,420
LAST MAN: I'd say the iPhone, yes.

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,280
MAN: <INAUDIBLE> ALEX: Sorry?

102
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,300
MAN: I said, <INAUDIBLE> ALEX: And that...

103
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
...That's
how to spend an evening.

104
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,500
Wow!

105
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,780
Just, wow!

106
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,580
And it's just getting even more red and looking
even more incredible.

107
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,940
That is just immense.

108
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,820
Guys, today has been insane.

109
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,150
I haven't been out to many events with companies.

110
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,530
Like, I've been taken to MWC - Mobile World
Congress - I've been taken to...

111
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,650
I've been taken to, err...

112
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,130
I've also been to CES in Vegas, right, and
these are all massive events but this was,

113
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,130
like, different.

114
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:04,210
This was something that Sony's just put on
- like, they've hired out this whole hotel.

115
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:07,320
Everyone staying in this hotel has something
to do with the Sony event.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,630
They've used the grounds of the hotel to do
awesome things like test out the phone slow

117
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:14,680
motion and let us, let us all do it in lab
coats and with goggles on and stuff.

118
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:18,041
And as I said today, you know, Sony have brought
me down here.

119
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,110
They haven't paid me to say anything.

120
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,850
I don't even have to say anything if I don't
want to but they just said: We'll bring you

121
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:26,120
down, you're more, we're more than happy for
you to vlog it if you want to, so, that's

122
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,040
what I've done today and it's been super,
super fun.

123
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,620
I really need to stop bringing so much stuff
with me.

124
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,890
Like, I just don't need it.

125
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:35,710
Like, all that stuff on there, I haven't even
touched.

126
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,150
I've only been here for two days - I've done
it again - it happened again.

127
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,260
I need to stop.

128
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,710
Guys, next time I'm packing, tell me to stop.

129
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:43,710
Grrrr!

130
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,070
Guys, my name's been Alex, you guys have been
awesome.

131
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,400
Drop a like rating if you've enjoyed the video
- it really helps me massively - and a comment

132
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:54,690
down below saying "end of video squad" - there
you go, that's a new one - I'll see you guys

133
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,340
in tomorrow's vlog.

134
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Ready?

135
00:08:57,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Adios.
