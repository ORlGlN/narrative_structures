17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,520
broke the drone like I crushed it and

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,830
the camera ripped off and I thought I'd

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,960
broken the camera new cameras for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,240
drones are about 500 pounds and I was

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,700
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah but I thought I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought right I</font>

just pick them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the drone and it works</font>

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,850
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why this is a massive</font>

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,409
issue is because i'm actually shooting a

27
