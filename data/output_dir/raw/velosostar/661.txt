29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bluetooth turned off on my phone I've</font>

stopping now but I've had a shower with

34
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,100
gymed with feeling full of endorphins

35
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,620
ready for the day I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and test</font>

36
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,590
out this battery which I've spent like

37
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,560
150 pounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> on for the inspire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one and as</font>

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys know if you didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font>

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,200
bought<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new battery for the inspire one</font>

40
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,760
this is the one it came with and the

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,110
inspire one for some reason actually

42
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,960
comes with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a battery that's like you can</font>

43
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,580
buy a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bear battery than the one it comes</font>

44
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,870
with some reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've include the</font>

45
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,310
best one in the box which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ridiculous</font>

46
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,280
because the inspires ridiculously

47
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,600
expensive as it is so you think they

48
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you everything but no they don't</font>

49
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,870
partly this but new battery that I've

50
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,670
bore should last a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer so</font>

51
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,110
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test that out and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

52
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not wasting my money and if it</font>

53
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,020
doesn't if it lasts about the same time

54
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">as that one then I may as well just send</font>

55
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,260
this back because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 150 quid</font>

56
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,620
but let's go for a fly and see if this

57
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,860
battery was worth<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money I've got my</font>

58
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,270
controller or now we're gonna need a

59
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,560
won't need a memory card as well

60
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,040
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually such a nice day today</font>

61
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,400
no wind nice son I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling this is</font>

62

gonna be a good weekend that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

63
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,290

64
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,209
man we've got people fishing and i hope

65
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:52,340
this journey noise isn't gonna put them

66
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,470
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> um no but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got a nice leg to</font>

67
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,550
fly<font color="#E5E5E5"> on we can fly all the way down here</font>

68
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've got boats and stuff and go all the</font>

69
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,000
way down there so let's set up

70
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,150
I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead and fly</font>

71
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,500
from the inside of my carcass and I can

72
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,940
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the screen it's really</font>

73
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,670
something outside so let's take a trip

74
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">downriver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shall we</font>

75
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,430
you

76
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,790
and also what I can do is tell it to

77
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,890
come home by pressing this it will not

78
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,470
fly home by itself what i can do is

79
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,090
while it's flying home by itself just

80
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,280
control the camera and look round which

81
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,410
is really really really cool by splendor

82
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">to 100 meters and now it's going to come</font>

83
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,890
home<font color="#CCCCCC"> so to make sure it doesn't hit any</font>

84
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,840
trees it's really intelligent as you can

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,340
see now it's flying back by itself and

86
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,140
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it just mess around with</font>

87
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,480
the camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hey look at me in my mini I</font>

91
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,930
got fifty nine percent battery remaining

92
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,660
that's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool and it's definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

93
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,030

99
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,790

104
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,130
take both batches with me and have about

105
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,930
30 minutes in the air to capture footage

106
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,870
which is probably now the fact that I'm

107
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,000
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade next is the memory card in</font>

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,320
the drones because I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only got the one</font>

109
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,180
it came within its only 16 gig and

110
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,840
recording 4k to a 16 gig card is gonna

111
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,460
run it out really quickly so message

112
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe where that's a 32 gig or a 64 gig</font>

113
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,110
card in the near future but we'll cross

114
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,850
that bridge when we come to it now I

115
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,400

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it's going to really raise</font>

136
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:51,069
a pin-sharp as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> CA now gotta edit it</font>

143
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:07,209
rendering out as you can see took me

144
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:09,129
about an hour to render it is now almost

145
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:11,499
three o'clock I think it took me

146
00:06:11,499 --> 00:06:13,709
literally an hour to edit so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

147
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:17,439
beat our target and in this time as well
