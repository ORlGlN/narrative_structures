who is paid on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fixed salary each month</font>

153
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:05,240
and he is like the cameraman and second

154
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,160
editor of that channel me obviously

155
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,190
being the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first editor it brings a few</font>

156
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,570

that channel from<font color="#E5E5E5"> MV GT HD or Alex's</font>

159
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,640
tech as it is right now to something

160
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">else I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to set that up as its own</font>

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand like let's say for instance like</font>

unbox therapy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is such a sick name</font>

163
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,230
that is awesome something something

164
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,210
along the lines of like a totally

165
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,550
different name<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally different to me</font>

166
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,870
