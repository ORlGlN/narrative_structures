39
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,900
suspension and the engines a little bit

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,100
tuned and it goes a little bit faster

41
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's in a nutshell pretty much</font>

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a John Cooper Works is so I've got</font>

43

45
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,119
really just miss miss my whip if I open

54
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the technology in the car is</font>

55
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,920
it is the actual car itself so that'll

56
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,540
be a big thing I'm focusing on when I'm

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,670
looking for a new vehicle I think anyway

58
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,440
