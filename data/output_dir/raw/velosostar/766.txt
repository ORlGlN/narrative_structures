27
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,340
pretty broad topic justjust cameras is

28
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,469
that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cameras that we used to</font>

29
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,390
shoot our videos or just cameras in

30
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,600
general but what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think just</font>

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,369
cameras that we shoot our videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font>

32
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,170
think ya think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should do sort of</font>

33
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,210
cameras that were shoe with so high end

34
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,280
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> yellow end that you can get</font>

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 650 and give people to a broad</font>

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,900
spectrum between two beautiful right so

37
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,520
let's look at this from a YouTube

38
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,560
perspective because obviously people

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,580
that want people that want to know about

40
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,049

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,000
mass media I talk about it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

112
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,560
the company where we do promotional

113
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,930
videos I do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those videos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

114
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,870
Jed as well and I wanted a really really

115
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,790
really good camera to record the

116
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,590
promotional videos with<font color="#E5E5E5"> four companies</font>

117
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,790
so nothing to do with YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

118
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:06,750
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here the videos for</font>

119
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,940
companies I<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted a nice camera to</font>

120
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,950
record with so I bought back camera and

121
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,780
they ended up not really using it as

122
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,489
much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd hoped because I wasn't</font>

123
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:16,649
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting enough working to justify</font>

124
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,769
2,000 pounds on a sony a7s so what I

125
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,380
thought I'd do is I'd buy this lens and

126
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,660
what this lens does is it lets me

127
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,090
put this lens on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sony a7s and it has</font>

128
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,160
insane auto focus and it's incredibly

129
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,740
wide so what you want in a vlogging

130
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,330
camera is good<font color="#E5E5E5"> autofocus and you want it</font>

131
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,590
too wide so you can see everything

132
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">around you that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like pretty much what</font>

133
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need and this lens lets you do that</font>

134
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,140
it's all about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at use it's</font>

135
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,820
incredibly wide it has really quiet and

136
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,520
fast autofocus exactly what a vlogger

137
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,290
needs and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the Sonia</font>

night you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Sonia so unless you're</font>

155
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,440
not going to have an issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

156
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,410
the other camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is a little bit</font>

157
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,490
ridiculous and there's really no point

158
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:28,410
in getting it but I thought it's worth a

159
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,810
mint sorry my phone like run out of

160
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,010
storage but there's really no point in

161
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,980
getting it is the sony rx100 mark for

162
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,240
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a thousand-pound</font>

163
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,100
point-and-shoot camera and it does some

164
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,020
crazy stuff like 4k and<font color="#E5E5E5"> raw imaging if</font>

165
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're into your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cameras but this I</font>

166
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,890
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend it at all for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube</font>

167
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,050
it's just a total waste of money I would

168
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,700
one hundred percent hands-down recommend

169
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,290
you guys to get this cannon and g7x<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

170
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,669
drop a link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the description if</font>

171
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:54,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to start for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube channels</font>

172
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,390

173
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,190
recording this on my phone right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and</font>

174
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you can tell it's passable quality</font>

175

this is on my iphone right now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

176

177
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the quality is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ducing something</font>

178
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,919
it before no one's complained so so yeah

179
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:13,560
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> an open topic it's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

180
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,140
want what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can afford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but if someone</font>

182
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,770
camera to start out<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube channel</font>

183
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,669
it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the canon g7x or the canon</font>

184
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:26,610
650d but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd probably say the g7x</font>

185
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,560
because it has awesome quiet autofocus<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

186
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,090
nice microphone<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's compact you can</font>

187
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,890
take it anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's just a great</font>

188
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">all-around camera for youtube and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing if you want to shoot like</font>

193
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:42,309
cinematics then go for 650d because you

194
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:43,330
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that you can get different</font>

195
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,679
letters for it they're interchangeable

196
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,629
and create a sort of cinematic look but

197
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:48,009
