28
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna do it and</font>

I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna make make make people happy</font>

30
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,469
because obviously people people want to

31
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,120
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the thing is with things like</font>

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that when people asked me how to be</font>

33
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,170
successful when people you know people

34
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,970
come to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say Alex how do you be</font>

35
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,470
sitting high number one I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font>

36
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,790
qualified to give this sort of

37
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,990
information because number one I'm not

38
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">successful person then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

39
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,860
define your your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> sucks that you</font>

40
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,540
define your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> success no one can</font>

41
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,939
define that for you so everyone has

42
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,680
their own idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> success no one is</font>

43
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,270
really successful do you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I mean</font>

44
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:26,460
it it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to explain like your</font>

45
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,810
success might be a hundred percent

46
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,390
different for my success like someone

47
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">success might be to have five million</font>

48
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:35,130
houses all around the world and sports

49
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,720
cars on the drive<font color="#CCCCCC"> and someone else's</font>

50
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,060
success maybe just to like what one of

51
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> successes that I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

52
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,509
do is it's not to have a sports car

53
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:44,250
right it's not to have them sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

54
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,049
flashy sports car right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one of</font>

55
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,049
my successes one of my success is is to

56
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:51,540
buy a car with all of the add-ons like

57
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,520
so that might be like I've got a mini at

58
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,290
the moment but it's a stock one it's got

59
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,640
nothing on it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have like</font>

60
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,890
bluetooth for the phone it had a crap

61
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,149
sound system in it so you know I've

62
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:02,159
replaced the sound system<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself but one</font>

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,799
of my absolute goals is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font>

64
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,310
successes if you like is to buy a car

65
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,810
that has every single attachment on it

66
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,580
so it has like the heads up display has

67
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,319
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> bluetooth as like a navigation</font>

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,940
system as like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome sound system</font>

69
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">built in like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people have different</font>

70
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,349
different meanings of the term success

71
00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:20,720
it's really hard to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it well</font>

72
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,310
going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to what I was saying like it</font>

73
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,140
when someone asks me how to do well or

74
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,840
how to do something and I might really

75
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,700
harsh at it i will say like just

76
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,250
put your head down put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work in stop</font>

77
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,290
being a and literally out because

78
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,790
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wouldn't lie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

79
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">like if someone asks me how to do</font>

80
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,599
something I'll say get off your

81
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:42,350
ass and do it put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some work in because</font>

82
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,430
you ain't going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> results if you</font>

83
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,360
didn't put the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's pretty</font>

84
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,340
much what I was trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say in that</font>

85
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,780
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I didn't want people to take</font>

86
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,040
it the wrong ways if I was been like an

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,900
asshole or anything but if someone asked

88
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,430
to me you know Alex how do i do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

89
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,599
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> just tell you to get off your ass</font>

90
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,190
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just drag and go and do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font>

91
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,150
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way shits gonna happen</font>

92
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,239
like the only way I do stuff like it's

93
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,980
because I get off my ass and I do it

94
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,230
it's as simple as that it's literally as

95
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,019
simple as that like learn as you go

96
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,670
