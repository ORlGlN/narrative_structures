the camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> this records it all in for</font>

78
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kane you can monitor it and it does all</font>

82
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things these things love these</font>

83
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">things aren't cheap but we really wanted</font>

84
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make the switch to 4k just so you</font>

85
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,950
guys have the best experience when when

86
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,330
watching the video so all that the

87
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,780
static videos where the cameras static

88
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,510
will be all now shot in 4k records to an

89
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,180
SSD so you put an SSD inside of here and

90
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,470
then that's how you get those insane

91
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,970
transfer speeds right now so I'm just

92
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,890
transferring them over all the clips

93
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,370
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and yeah the video today</font>

94
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,040
should be our first video<font color="#E5E5E5"> in 4k on tech</font>

95
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,540
flow so that should be absolutely

96
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,310
awesome it's a monumental ting as a

97
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,780
monument there's a monumental thing

98
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,730
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> move in forming in 1080p and</font>

99
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,050
now everyone's movements 4k so we

100
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,730
thought now we've got I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

101
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the switch we've got it we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be</font>

102
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,080
like everybody else so yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that</font>

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,640
and I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> watched it obviously just as</font>

104
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,290
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video to tell you guys tell</font>

105
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,900
you guys that and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a little bit</font>

106
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,180
of an issue as well because when you buy

107
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,440
it it doesn't actually come<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

108
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,030
charger which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great so you have to</font>

109
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,680
actually plug it into the mains when

110
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,260
you're using it which is a massive ball

111
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,370
ache because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been filming outside</font>

112
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,850
today yeah and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have like an</font>

113
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,800
extension cable coming out to the screen

114
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,990
like the guys claim you say the screen

115
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:17,108
and because it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a battery like</font>

116
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:18,790
but they don't give you charger so it's

117
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,339
like so you've got I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a bar on</font>

118
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,630
those just one of those inconvenient

119
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving convenient things um but yeah</font>

120
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:26,320
