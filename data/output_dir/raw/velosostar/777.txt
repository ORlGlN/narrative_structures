00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:06,450
course that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a university</font>

63
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,950
or college you n roll on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a course that</font>

64
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,940
pretty much means to say that you're

65
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,450
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it but what else I can do what</font>

66
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,730
other options is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can defer the course</font>

67
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,530
for a year and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people do this</font>

68
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,480
and it's called taking a gap year and

69
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,519
pretty much what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is you take it</font>

70
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:21,379
take a year it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a year off you</font>

73
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,950
or 64 and university here in the UK and

74
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,660
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year to do what you want</font>

75
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,730
now a lot of people use that year to go

76
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">traveling let's say to wherever they</font>

111
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,100
are interested in setups and and

112
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,639
technology and stuff and I don't want

113
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:48,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">like all the technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people's with</font>

would like if you watch obviously what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

117
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,910
was thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing was doing like a</font>

118
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,859
weekly tech series or something on the

119
00:03:57,859 --> 00:03:59,030
main channel where I could talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

120
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,470
setups and how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve them and</font>

121
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,700
obviously I can do those videos all

122
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,870
around the world I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at</font>

123
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,730
this help right here and I could also do

124
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,160
videos like trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build my ultimate</font>

125
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,380
traveling<font color="#E5E5E5"> setup like going around the</font>

126
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,840
world set up to vlog and all my camera

127
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,810
gear and and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the whole year</font>

128
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,519
of epic videos on the main channel and

129
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,690
obviously daily vlogging on this channel

130
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,450
obviously and the only other problem

131
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,130
with it is the tech videos on the tech

132
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,650
channel

133
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,300
stop for a year but<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that year I</font>

134
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">come back and carry on doing it if that</font>

135
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,930
makes sense i mean i could grind those

136
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,460
the videos now unlike stagger upload

137
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,340
them but they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty hard to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

138
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">think so yeah we're gonna just see how</font>

139
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:36,360
it goes i put the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> now to you</font>

140
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,570
guys should i travel and make awesome

141
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,550
videos<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean the thing is if i go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

142
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,990
university i'm going to be just making

143
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,130

147
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,389
here so it's going to be like I

148
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:53,190
think the best thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do would be to</font>

travel and take you guys with me and I

150
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,220
