130
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,910
into this house this mirror was one of

131
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,289
my favorite things because it had all

132
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:27,000
lights around it it was like you know an

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,289
ordered lights lit up when you see this

134
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:30,660
pattern here it all lit up but as you

135
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,849
can see there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> no lights anywhere but</font>

136
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,199
there that's right all the Bulls have

137
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,630
died and I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed them and</font>

138
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,680
I've never brought us all<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

139
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,599
changing them she promised it in hold on

140
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,120
a sec artist just change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the freaking</font>

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,500
balls let's put your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand behind it</font>

142
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,360
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bulbs why are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you complaining</font>

143
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,699
more because like most things I've had a

144
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,830
really cool idea as you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

145
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,009
there's an LED strip up here right

146
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,080
there's no these two but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but I do</font>

147
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,690
however have a lot of this LED strip

148
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,820
unused like there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it here it</font>

149
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,520
just isn't being used so what I thought

150
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,990
would be really cool will be to tante

151
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,479
this mirror and put the LED strip around

152
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,340
this mirror so the LEDs actually come

153
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,229
through this mirror you just feed the

154
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:13,250
cable through<font color="#E5E5E5"> just there</font>

155

169
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,790
everyone's always the best guys were at

night because why not it was chucking it

173
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,449
already soaked let's do this

174
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,860
there we go 2.3 miles at a 722 pace not

175
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,210
too bad for like three in the morning

176
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,470
but when i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at running i was actually</font>

177
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,210
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about something and i was</font>

178
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:57,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about listen I've been thinking</font>

179
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,890
about recent that's been in my mind they

180
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,360
shouldn't really be on my mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was</font>

181
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking how can i get this said thing</font>

182
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:04,410
off my mind and I sort of put it into

183
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,640
perspective when I this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I like</font>

184
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,410
to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to run at night</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up like be</font>

185
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,300
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> music and I like to think about</font>

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,090
stuff pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can to terms</font>

187
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,980
with right is life as a timeline right

188
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,180
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your timeline and that is</font>

189
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,770
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's always moving forward and</font>

190
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,000
you're moving forward with it you can't

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
stop<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the timeline you're always going</font>

192
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going forward with the timeline at</font>

193
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,300
the same place as the timeline if that

194
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,390
makes sense right so why do people focus

195
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,750
so much on like the past or the future

196
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,520
you are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this timeline you're there</font>

197
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,680
right now so why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> making that</font>

198
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,830
time right now focusing on something in

199
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,990
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say about is gonna happen</font>

200
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,370
why would you save something Bad's can

201
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,780
happen in the future why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spend</font>

202
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,850
the time now worrying about it and

203
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,340
making not now now it's time bad as well

204
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,510
as the time in the future that's going

205
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,650
to be bad if that makes sense you've got

206
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,610
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> future that you know is</font>

207
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,950
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be bad it's a bad situation why</font>

208
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,750
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time now worrying about it</font>

209
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,660
when there's no need<font color="#E5E5E5"> just deal with it</font>

210
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,280
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like don't spend the time</font>

211
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,290
now worrying about it live right in the

212
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,200
moment the moment you're in like make

213
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
like the best it can be dead spend your

214
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,990
time worrying about the past because

00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:08,790
ain't gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and don't spend the</font>

216
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,320
time worrying about them for comfort the

217
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,940
friggin future because the future is

218
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and you can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

219
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,950
about it so why make the time now change

220
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,330
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's happened in</font>

221
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:20,610
the past of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future that's why I was</font>

222
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought what's</font>

223
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:23,850

230
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,259
workspace that you work in reflects your

231
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,180
work you've only thinking out is helping

232
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,529
to work space that your work and reflect

233
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:48,209
the actual work that you produce well

234
00:10:48,209 --> 00:00:00,000
