00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,539
that if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to renew the year</font>

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:22,980
after if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to renew your</font>

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,539
membership you have to let the vote

13
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,150
three months in advance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently</font>

14
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,189
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't let them know that you</font>

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,929
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know three months time you</font>

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to pay 261 pounds so I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just got</font>

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,040
to pay 261<font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds because I didn't tell</font>

21
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,160
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably would still renew my</font>

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,530
membership if I hadn't moved house the

23
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,489
reason that didn't renew the membership

24
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,050
is because I've moved<font color="#CCCCCC"> house since last</font>

25
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,030
year and I'm just waited far away from

143
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,480
been envisioning a shot with the drone

144
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,310
right but in beating this shop and just

145
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine a train just going down the</font>

146
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,480
track and then the drone<font color="#E5E5E5"> just following</font>

147
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,400
the train and slowly going up so what

148
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,780
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking of doing is actually taking</font>

149
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,100
the drone right now to the train station

150
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,650
waiting for a train to come and then

151
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,450
following the train with the drone just

152
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get this really cool shot Bob having</font>

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">my brother know I've been thinking about</font>

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:49,540
this is so<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool so you're probably</font>

198
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,370
thinking Alex what the heck are you

199
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,590
doing and while these here these have

200
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,600
been cut to length these poles here have

201
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,100
been cut off the ends of these ones and

202
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,800
these are the exact length for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> desk</font>

203
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,690
legs for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new office they've</font>

204
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is why the hell are</font>

205
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,470
using scaffolding legs for your new desk

206
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,990
and yeah that would be a little bit odd

207
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,090
however I'm spray painting them the

208
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:12,610
scaffolding legs in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gun metal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray</font>

209
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,990
so hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

210
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,790
bit better and why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got sunglasses</font>

211
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,280
on inside all because I don't have any

212
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,900
safety goggles and these like the best

213
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,730
things I could find so I don't get

214
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,040
sparks in my eye but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to record me</font>

215
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,960

219
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,620
place you'll know that you've done it

220
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,760
all yourself you built it all yourself

221
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,230
and there's a real sense of

222
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,460
accomplishment when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that</font>
