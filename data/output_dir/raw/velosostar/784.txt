40
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,650
get your guys opinion on the vlog

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,290
channel because the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like about</font>

42
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,430
the vogue channel is I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just upload</font>

43
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,100
whatever and you guys either click it or

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,960
you don't and then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it whatever</font>

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,380
it's cool but with the main channel it's

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,409
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more like and need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">be careful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I upload on that because</font>

48
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:53,009
if it's not good people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get</font>

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,360
pissy and I don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I would</font>

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,070
never upload crap I'd never upload crap

51
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,299

anything I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I don't know</font>

122
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,440
what I would do myself I wouldn't get

123
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a job I just wouldn't do it I</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else and help yourself but</font>

128
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,730
you wouldn't really be helping yourself

129
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:47,040
because you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be helping somebody else</font>

130
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,770
see what I mean like how i would have to

131

sort of crack on with my Mars media and

132
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,640

00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,500
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work through that but</font>

134
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,210

Mars media and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sustain income for me but</font>

136
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,610
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know I don't know I'm just I'm</font>
