00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,870
it's all about risk of awards what I say

107
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,840
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do in life is risk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

111
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,120
what I say to myself like risk and

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,370
reward Jesus<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something risk and</font>

113
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,610
reward like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> risk what will be the</font>

114
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,200
rewards will be the drawbacks what will

115
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,930
be the benefits are the risks worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

116
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,089
the rewards will be do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

117
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,260
mean it's like the risk and reward

118
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,480
factor is just like everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like</font>

119
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything you do every every decision</font>

you make everything click it up look up

121
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,690
look at risk and reward everything and a

122
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,880
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot more risky and a lot</font>

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,770
of things aren't frisky at all but

124
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously you know taking a year off and</font>

125
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:40,590
relying on youtube youtube for one year

126
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:43,140
is a risk that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have taken</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

127
