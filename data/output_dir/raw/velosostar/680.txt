25
00:01:30,369 --> 00:01:35,110
sounds like LEDs whoa oh it's this color

26
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,720
RGB so I'm assuming that means color red

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,330
green blue and therefore his LEDs I

28
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:51,369
guessed it i actually test it<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this</font>

29
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:54,850
will be the test this Cable will tell me

30
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,190
that I haven't broken or have broken a

31
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,409
1,500 pound camera this is the moment of

32
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,500

story short<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not the camera</font>

37
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,680
