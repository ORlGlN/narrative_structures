00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,159
the NEC is in birmingham so it's quite

92
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,560
central<font color="#E5E5E5"> to in the UK and there's like a</font>

you can have to buy food there by drink

105
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:46,620
there and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be just insanely</font>

106
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,680
expensive and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be an issue i</font>

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,049

109
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">was like four pound for pound for</font>

110
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,090
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like a little little</font>

111
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,090
little stupid little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tin of something so</font>

112
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,799
it's just it's just honestly like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

113
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:03,689
they didn't take the piss on the prices

114
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:04,290
but they've gotta make that money

115
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,519
somehow its business at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

116
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,239
day so yeah that is that is pretty much

117
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:10,620

120
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,620
is not uploading a vlog on the main

121
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,570
channel of yesterday I think we're going

122
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,510
to combine yesterday's video and today's

123
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,760
content for the main channel and put

124
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,100
them in more

125
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,420
video because not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> much happens</font>

126
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,980
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not really like a</font>

127
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun-packed event you could go to</font>

128
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,510
insomnia just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one day and you'd</font>

129
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,620
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do everything that's there</font>

130
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,240
honestly that's pretty much the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

131
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">bottom of it you do yeah you do then</font>

132
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,270
like there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not much to unless you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

133
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">meat and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> friends or just rely on our</font>

134
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,370
case oh man is for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way nodes but</font>

135
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,530
like it's just it gets a bit dead in a

136
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:46,360
bit boring<font color="#E5E5E5"> so exactly pretty good for</font>

137
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">one day yeah so if you go for one day</font>

138
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,050
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to see everything see and</font>

139
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,150
do everything pretty much and you don't

140
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,440
you don't need to go for three days so

141
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm probably going to combine</font>

142
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,510
yesterday's vlog footage with today's

143
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,160
