you guys and tell you guys what's been

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,310
going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head over the last sort</font>

117
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,450
of four or five months and it all pretty

118
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">much started when I moved into this</font>

119
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,430
house which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely great I did a</font>

120
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,470
series on the main channel called<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

121
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,770
log and I moved to this house<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

122
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,720
guys loved it and that did the ultimate

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up series which inevitably went a</font>

124
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
little bit viral with the first episode

125
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,930
gang over a million one hundred thousand

126
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,210
a million views which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is incredible but</font>

127
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,760
I also brought along a lot of negativity

128
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,530
to the channel a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people thought</font>

129
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,570
you know because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my size and they</font>

130
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,860
thought I was a lot younger than I was

131
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they thought that you know my</font>

132
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,010
parents bought me everything and

133
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,790
contrary to pop you to believe my

134
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,370
parents are actually split up

135
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,560
which is a major shame but I'm not not

136
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
going to get into that but I did all

137
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
this set of stuff and now everyone just

138
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,729
expects that from me on the main channel

139
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:35,639
that that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people expect me to do</font>

140
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:37,139
so then I started up the series called

141
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:38,850
the gaming debt now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not much more I</font>

142
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,889
can do to that room I live in a house

143
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a lot of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a big house</font>

144
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,100
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got a lot of people living in</font>

145
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,070
it and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> garage of this house</font>

146
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,500
isn't just my room to go and take down

147
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,320
gels and and do what I want with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

148
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,699
the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm really facing is I'm</font>

149
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:55,560
running out of ideas of things to do

150
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gaming related on my main</font>

151
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,940
channel and I feel on the main channel

152
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:03,210
like if I was to go but you know if I

153
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,440
was to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something a little bit landish</font>

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,870
like do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do on</font>

155
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">that channel then people on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that channel</font>

156
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,500

157
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">really that is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really horrible thing</font>

158
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,650
knowing that I've got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube channel</font>

159
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,530
which at one point I was proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> of but at</font>

160
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:19,350
the moment now i procrastinate uploading

161
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,240
to it now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you've noticed but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

162
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,699
used to upload every three or so days on

163
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,430
my youtube channel now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I upload once or</font>

164
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:29,849
twice every two weeks and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

165
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:31,560
really really really been getting to me

166
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,990
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously getting to me and the</font>

167
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,089
thing is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit here and I say to myself</font>

168
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,940
Alex you're just being stupid it's your

169
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube channel do what you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want but I</font>

170
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:42,479
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure you guys are happy and</font>

171
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,880
stuff and other thing is I'm an over

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,339
thinker and I tell you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are my</font>

173
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,230
overthinking only creates problems that

174
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,990
don't really exist so don't overthink

175
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,680
but it's much easier said<font color="#E5E5E5"> than done</font>

176
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,230
which is unfortunate but I just didn't

177
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,790
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that off my chest and I</font>

178
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,650
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let you guys know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that as of</font>

179
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,470
tomorrow I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> making a change for the</font>

180
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">main channel now it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a drastic</font>

181
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,870
change pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all I'm going to be</font>

182
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,540
doing is focusing a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the main</font>

183
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,800
channel putting a lot of time and effort

184
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,690
in on that channel not saying I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

185
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,800
to stop doing daily vlogs I'm gonna

186
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,970
bring you guys along every day but I

187
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,350
just want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> let you guys know that I'm</font>

188
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be creating a lot more videos</font>

189
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,680
for mars bar which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good</font>

190
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it's I'm really disappointed</font>

191
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,040
in myself is what I'm trying to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

192
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,600
it's taken me this long to make this

193
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,270
change and I don't know why

194
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,410
but nevertheless it's something that

195
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,850
I've wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about with you guys</font>

196
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:34,010
and if you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> would share your</font>
