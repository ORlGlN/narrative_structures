152
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,800
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> should all do this too right number</font>

153
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,990
one what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should do is like turn on</font>

154
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,640
that two-step verification thing I know

155
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,840
I've heard a few people say it doesn't

156
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">really help but just turn it on anyway</font>

157
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,030
because why the fuck not and also have a

158
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,380
different password for everything

159
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,500
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way the way the snapchat got</font>

160
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,360
hacks I'm trying to inform you guys the

161
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,130
way the snap my snapchat got hacked was

162
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:48,080
because I use the same password for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

163
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,260
snapchat as I did on my xsplit account

164
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,820
that exploits what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd use when you</font>

165
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,710
live streaming pretty much and pretty

166
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,110
much a database of all passwords and

167
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,660
email addresses for xsplit and got

168
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,070
removed this is xsplit if you didn't

169
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,140
know my xsplit comes probably have to

170
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,810
haven't even attempted to look I'm a

171
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,970
explicar but this is xsplit when it when

172
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,790
it manages to open there you go that's

173
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,940
xsplit broadcaster it's what you use to

174
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,800
that's what you used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stream with to</font>

175
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,900
like twitch and<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube and it loaded</font>

176
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,730
like databases got released of loads of

177
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,750
people's email addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and passwords</font>

178
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,400
and I use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same password for that</font>

179
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,800
xsplit as I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my snapchat so that's</font>

180
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,450
how they got that it's not not it's not

181
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,190
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult thing for people to do</font>

182
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,050
it's not like they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lengths to</font>

183
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:32,180
try and to try and hack it and the other

184
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,610
hack is security questions

185
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,740
what they do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they go on to the thing</font>

186
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they put in your security questions</font>

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,590
and if they saw obviously for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me because</font>

188
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,930
they watch my youtube videos over there

189
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,789
no like a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me like my cat's</font>

190
00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:46,469
name where i live like maybe the road i

191
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:48,110
live on maybe my blood my friend's name

192
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,610
so the light reset the security

193
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,439
questions and then it lets them<font color="#E5E5E5"> reset</font>

194
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,180
the password so another tip would be to

195
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,099
do which is what i've done as well it's

196
00:06:56,099 --> 00:06:58,800
heavy security questions like choose

197
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,750
like normal ones choose like what is

198
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:04,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">your best friend or like choose ladno</font>

199
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:06,900
watch your pet's name or ever but put

200
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,300
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> totally random</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just put</font>

201
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,379
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ledge I've written it all down</font>

202
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:12,599
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on a piece of paper so I</font>

203
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,219
remember them all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put like a</font>

204
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,389
load of gibberish I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for</font>

205
00:07:15,389 --> 00:07:18,060
everything so like it's like what's your

206
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">pet's name and then just put just put</font>

207
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:24,120
like nipple<font color="#E5E5E5"> Slayer 23,000 and the local</font>

208
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,439
load of numbers and a load of random

209
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,909
letters and there's no way<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's</font>

210
00:07:26,909 --> 00:07:29,129
