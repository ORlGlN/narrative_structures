<font color="#E5E5E5">this round I'm fairly good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at getting</font>

54
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,829
things done like if I've got emails to

00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,799
do I generally just do them but

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,540
sometimes if I can't do them what I do

59
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,520
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a major thing right what I</font>

60
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,810
do it's going to be simply give me like

61
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,310
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I not think of that right</font>

62
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,890
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a list unless you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

more important than<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube right</font>

92
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,159

93
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you guys probably</font>

encouraging us to do youtube<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

96
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,129
different things like that but no like

97
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,230
school is really really really important

98
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:14,480
I worked really hard in school to get to

99
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,299
college and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> college I met my friend</font>

101
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,410
became really good friends and now we do

102
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,209
the tech flow youtube<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel and we try</font>

103
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that really professionally and you</font>

104
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,359
know if I didn't work hard in school and

105
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:27,260
I didn't get the greatest<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to</font>

106
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,549
college not about what had happened and

107
00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:29,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I probably wouldn't be where I am today</font>

108
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,849
because I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> college and that</font>

109
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:33,379
allowed me to do this YouTube thing

110
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,150
because I went to college three days a

111
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,470
week and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two days either</font>

112
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,150
focus on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube and if I didn't do well</font>

go to college and on this will be

115
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:43,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

116
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:44,660
work hard in school at how to manage

117
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,519
time between between school and youtube

118
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,859
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in YouTube sorry if you're</font>

119
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:51,109
feeling youtube if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in school like</font>

120
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,970
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know focus on your schoolwork</font>

121
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,220
and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one video a week that's</font>

122
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,840
fair enough but is literally fair enough

123
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,699
unless you're a game player commentator

124
00:03:58,699 --> 00:04:00,290
and you wanted about when I was back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

125
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,699
school when I back it day when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at</font>

126
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,199
school it was all about Minecraft Let's

127
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,180
Plays and they were so easy to make like

128
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,040
it hit record and you play on minecraft

129
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,590
and upload it and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I did back</font>

130
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,260
back back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in day but like I don't know</font>

131
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,110
right list right list

132
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:17,810
and you know right listen bright<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font>

133
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,950
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> leash need to put the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

134
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important things to get done to</font>

135
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,240
manage your<font color="#E5E5E5"> time okay does that make</font>

136
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,550
sense and then also if you write the

137
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,590
list like you can keep the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> open and</font>

138
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,670
if you've got anything to add to the

139
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,660
list you can just come on add it to the

140
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,340
list like whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to that</font>

141
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,580
makes any sense but dies it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

142
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,440
simple one of the yesterday's episode

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,640
confidence that was easy as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but</font>
