11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,729
you guys already enjoyed today's logs

12
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,680
but I let's get going for a run right

13
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,270
now so let's do this

14
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,200
4.3 miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eight minute pace longest</font>

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">one I've done but the slowest run I've</font>

16
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,700
done so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the thing about setting</font>

17
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,250
goals is what you need to do to set a

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,788
goal is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be realistic but</font>

19
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:15,090
optimistic hey theory define optimistic

20
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,239
there you go there's two sides to it

21
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">right what you don't want to do is set a</font>

22
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,660
goal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide that it's ridiculously hard</font>

23
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,400
to achieve and then when you don't end

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,350
up achieving it you get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset and</font>

25
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">depressed whereas you can set a really</font>

26
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,880
easy gold and then once you achieve it

27
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,590
you don't really get any benefits

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,910
because the goal you set was too easy

29
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,860
you need to be optimistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it you</font>

30
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,300
to be realistic about it what you need

31
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,989
to do is one of my running goals is I

32
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,350
want to be able to run six miles<font color="#CCCCCC"> 710</font>

33
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,750
pace which isn't if you guys know

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,470
running isn't difficult really at all

35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,750
for a ruler like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if I</font>

36
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,430
worked at it do you know what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font>

37
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do it but it's going to take</font>

38
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,580
time to do it so when you're setting

39
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,130
goals for stuff just make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

40
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,959
set realistic goals that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can achieve</font>

41
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,390
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are hard to achieve and you'll</font>

42
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,160
know deep down about how long it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes</font>

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,810
you to get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as soon as you get</font>

44
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,250
that goal as soon as you achieve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

45
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,030
goal you will be happy with yourself

46
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:17,680
thus we're from the room has actually

47
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,510
made my hair single home for any gel in

48
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,840

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,879
any product in it but it is due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

50
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,200
stucco because of the sweat that's

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,000

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
borrowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> know to buy a sofa to put your</font>

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,030
edge on<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone and then have a little</font>

113
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,789

114
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,010
pride and joy whatever spell it all my

115
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,659
money on recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this this this</font>

116
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,909
wooden table with all my schools and

117
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:04,490
stuff on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but thing one finding really</font>

118
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,950
difficult miss office

119
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,390
I want it to be cool I don't want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

120
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,430
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I'm really proud of and I</font>

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,160
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look incredible I won't be</font>

122
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,580
athletics in this place to look insane

123
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,650
however that's going to be really

124
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,180
difficult because you have to spend a

125
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of money to have things you look</font>

126
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,740
nice and don't want to spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

127
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">money because like I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of</font>

128
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,370
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend if that makes sense so</font>

got these two head things right here

130
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's one right there and there's one</font>

131
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,680
