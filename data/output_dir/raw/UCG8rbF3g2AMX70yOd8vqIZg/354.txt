7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,640
Huh,  I hit them notes

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,500
So yo today is a BIG day, like you guys know this

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,160
I've been hyping this up for the past week

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
Aaahh, For Good Reason

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,840
But, I'm not gonna talk too much, 'cause today

12
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,900
Is not about me, in fact it is about this guy right here

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,080
There he is

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,460
There's my boy !!

15
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,400
Hi...say hello

16
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
It's your day

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
It's Your Day! YEAH

18
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
What?...

19
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,200
He doesn't know

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,200
So my boy wants to look fresh right he knows it's his big day, that's why he looks wet he took a shower like 20 minutes ago

21
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
*happy music playing*

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:49,900
There you go Maverick

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,000
*Maverick taking a bath*

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,900
Yeah!

25
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,500
Get nice and clean for the big day!!!!

26
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,000
 

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,760
you wanna look good, you've got a big day bro!

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,780
you wanna be sexy

29
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,780
get a little shower in there buddy, yeah

30
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,000
Good birdie Maverick!

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Once that dries off bro your gonna be the sexiest bird in all the land. Yeah!

32
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,200
So, Logan let me explain to you exactly what is happening today

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
Here buddy, I don't know why I picked you up

34
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,000
You guys have all, I think, seen this picture of Maverick

35
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
Wait, you definitely have 'cause  I've pointed to upstairs

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,600
Ha... BOM!

37
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,000
Ok, so look at this picture but, carefully what do you see besides the bird?

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,400
*Jeopardy music playing*

39
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,000
BOOM!

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Did you guys see this little ankle bracelet?

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was chilling with one of my homies one day and he was like "Yo, dude what if you.."

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,000
What?

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
No, no, no... I was telling a story

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
He goes "Dude! You should remove that bracelet" 'cause, I don't know if you guys noticed...

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,400
This essentially serves no purpose

46
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,800
Like I was in Ohio they were like "Yea, you can take it off. This won't do anything. It's just for us to like, mark him..."

47
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,300
WELL, GUESS WHAT

48
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,600
I DON"T WAN'T MY BIRD TO BE MARKED!

49
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,200
So he goes "Joe, go to the vet and have it cut off and then you should put like a diamond bracelet around his ankle"

50
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm like... YO, *mind blow FX*

51
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,000
That's some AMAZING idea!

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,200
He thinks so, too

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,700
(laughing)

54
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,400
So, if you look closely, Maverick no longer has his band on

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Did you guys see on his right ankle? The band isn't there anymore?

56
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
What do you think? You like it?

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,560
Obviously.. Your boy had to go to the vet and get it the vet... WTF

58
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,060
I love sun Conures Sp? i had one before this video hit home  for me
