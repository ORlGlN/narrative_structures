1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Yo, what is that noise?

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:01,460
OHH!!

3
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:01,960
YO!

4
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,100
YO, SHUT THE F*** UP!

5
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,620
No way!

6
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:06,960
No way...

7
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,740
*Nice Intro*

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,200
Ay yo, good morning logang, what's popping?

9
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,675
It is 6 Am we're all pretty tired.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,840
I went to bed 3 hours ago.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,240
Bro I don't know, I'm just, I'm out here bro.

12
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,280
We have quite the day planned, and now that's assuming we get the day started

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:31,380
We woke up early... well, I woke up early

14
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,560
And then woke Arnie up

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,920
Because we're Driving to Sequoia National Park today

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,140
I honest, I don't know what it is,

17
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,980
I don't know, like, what it looks like,

18
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,780
But I think it's cool, I think there's like trees and snow

19
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,100
And Taking Instagram Pictures. BUT! Listen, the point is

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,300
This trip is gonna be LIT!

21
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,800
Once again, I believe and this is all just assuming, we have like a 3-4 hour drive.

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,600
And then, I think we're there, and when I say "we",

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,760
I mean Me, Arnie,

24
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,700
My boy GEORGIE!

25
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,080
And, potentially some other kid.

26
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm not sure, but Georgie, George Janko

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,020
We need to see if this man is up,

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,580
And also, look who is up (oh hi Mark :o)

29
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,760
That's Ma Boiii- Team No Shirt, let's go

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,720
Yo Yes, Bro, Team No Shirt

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,280
Why are you up right now? I've gotta ask.

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,900
Mark : What do you mean? I always get up this early.

33
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,840
No you did not Mark, it's 6 AM

34
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,960
Mark: It's Valentine's Day, bro

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,600
Yo, your excuses right now are making 0 sense!

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,400

37
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,300
Mark: No like, legit I usually get up this early... :o

38
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,200
Wait, really?

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,700
Mark: Yeah..

40
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,640
Can I tell you something Mark?

41
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,840
George texted me and said

42
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,320
'Not feedlong good, gonna pass bro, everything's spinning for me'

43
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,680
What did you do last night?

44
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:38,860
I don't know..bro

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,420
We had fun.

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,260
Mark: It's good, as long as you had fun

47
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,140
It's good right?

48
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:41,920
It's a good time.

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,420
Yes so, okay

50
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,460
George is not coming

51
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,760
GEORGE GEORGE GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE!

52
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,560
Oh-ho ho ho!

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,060
Oh ho ho ho!

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,140
OH--(evil laugh or intensifying)

55
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah bro, so, we brought these warm coats

56
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,620
'Cause, apparently it gets cold there. It's snowy right?

57
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,620
I don't know, I don't know any of this

58
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,620
We're just assuming everything,

59
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,000
Yo, do you think my car's gonna be able to make it up?

60
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,300
I hope so

61
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,780
Yeah, me too

62
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,200
Here's a kicker

63
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,460
I let Arnie drive my car because I'm way too tired for this

64
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,220
Do you feel powerful? Do you feel in charge?

65
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,880
...Like a man driving this... machine. Yo what I was gonna say bro,

66
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,460
when I grab this wheel I'm just like... RAWR!!!

67
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,080
RAWR!!! Apparently it's not just me

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,900
We are on the highway right now

69
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,280
Look at the school bus... WOW!!

70
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:24,355
I'm a little nervous, but, I'm gonna take this opportunity to get some sleep

71
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:27,205
The next time you see us, we will either be dead

72
00:02:27,205 --> 00:02:30,320
because Arnie crashed the car or at Sequoia National Park!

73
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,300
I'm hoping the latter

74
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,220
Please don't crash this car while I'm asleep

75
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,680
Dude, say something to confirm

76
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,060
I'll try not to

77
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,105
Reassuring, WOW. Ok, thanks Arnie. Sequoia National Park,

78
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,100
Here we come!

79
00:02:43,260 --> 00:03:14,000
*Guitar music*

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,520
*Nice car pulling up with the dab*

81
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,660
Oh ho ho ho ho ho

82
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,080
Oh BOI!!

83
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:24,635
ECHO!

84
00:03:25,575 --> 00:03:26,575
MOM?

85
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,520
Like and Subscribe to my YouTube Channel. You should delete your YouTube account.

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,120
What? Ok, guys. Arnie and I made it

87
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,100
Bro, how was the drive?

88
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,280
It was beautiful, dude. And now we're in, like I've said for the

89
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,035
5th hundred time. Don't know how this park works.

90
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,100
But I know that right now we are in, what is this called?

91
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,840
The giant tree, the big tree, the giant tree forest?

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,980
YOU GOT IT!

93
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,920
Let me tell you, uh, it is named that for a good reason.

94
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,580
That is because the trees are GIANT!!

95
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,780
I bet this does not look that big on camera

96
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,120
Like these trees are just kind of the mediocre trees

97
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,940
And no offense guys you're just, I mean you're

98
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,640
yeah, kind of just ok

99
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,720
Hut hut!

100
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,100
Imma put on some hiking boots

101
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,400
These are freaking nice, yo look how fancy they are

102
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,100
Arnie has a super intense camera rig as well

103
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,540
Tell me about the shots that are gonna be captured today Arnie

104
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,140
These shots are gonna be some cinematic movie quality bro

105
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,140
Cinematic movie quality!

106
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,320
Let's go!

107
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:38,080
*Music*

108
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,700
So we're just kind of hiking around here

109
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,360
and across the way we see

110
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,960
this tree is huge!

111
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,980
have you ever seen a tree that big?

112
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,060
No I've never seen a tree that big

113
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,720
Yeah and actually we're just gonna talk about it and not show you guys, sorry

114
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,900
Ha ha! Gotcha!!

Thats the tree across the way you guys see? Its the orange one right there and my finger is pointing at it

116
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,020
You guys see it? I'll zoom in in case you don't see it

117
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,060
You guys see it now?

118
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,140

Can you hear it too?

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
this butthole makes noise

127
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,660
Yo thats crazy!

128
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,740
Looking down in there?

129
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,920

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:43,160
*Music

134
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,880
Ah! Its so cold bro

135
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,220
Aaaaaah

136
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,040
Oh my god its so good though dude

137
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,660
We are approaching the big tree

138
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,020
If you look to your left, you can see this massive guy oh my goodness

139
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:13,400
*Music*

140
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,320
This is so cool, dude

141
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,020
We could literally, honestly, we could live in here

142
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,880
I think we should ditch our lives, both of us

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,020
And me and you, just live in this tree for the rest of our lives

144
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,200
Carve it out a little bit,

145
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,460
Yeah, bro

146
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,120
It's cool cause I mean you can see,

147
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
Someone like, had burnt the tree to form this hole I think

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
Well, I mean that's not cool

149
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,580
Cause, deforestation is bad

150
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,760
I dont know why I said it was cool, it's not cool

151
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,260
*Laughs*

152
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:46,700
*Music*

153
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,320
So we're walkig back to the car, and this, this just breaks my heart

154
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,800
There's just a little shoe here

155
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,140
You know what this means dude? Arnie, some kid died, bro

156
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,820
There's a dead kid in these, in these mountains

157
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,040
It means, Im not the only one that lost a shoe in the snow

158
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,780
Arnie lost his shoe, also, why are you wearing these orange,

159
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,840
like, running shoes bro?

160
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,160
Dude when I came here not realize we be playing in the snow.

161
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:20,765
Yeah, it doesn't really snow in California ever..

162
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:22,435
And maybe the kid that died also didn't know that

163
00:07:22,435 --> 00:07:24,515
R.I.P kid

164
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:26,045
And and also vine too

165
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,255
ok, so we are going to the next location and I like this

00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:35,255

168
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:35,755
