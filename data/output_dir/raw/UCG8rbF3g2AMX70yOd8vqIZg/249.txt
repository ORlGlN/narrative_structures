No, oh my cuz they said I'm going to catch you broke we had trust issues after that. We did uh some trusted

154
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,869
[mouth] was the last one I've never

155
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:49,419
Told this story on the internet before and if I have I've forgotten and I'm really tired yeah, I

156
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,570
Don't know watch carefully

157
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:06,249
Seemingly innocent you wonder why I went like this when he fell on my chair like that. I feel like

158
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:13,270
That was an ode to my right testicle. Which is now, and I'm not kidding when I say this

159
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,919
Fifteen percent smaller I'm literally missing

160
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,660
15 percent of my right testicle

161
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:27,070
Because of this vine that wasn't [even] funny. It wasn't here do I say I was like your dwarf still

162
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,120
Oh, we're Gonna put a godzilla

Mask on Evan I'm Gonna get up at 6 will be right up down

164
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:32,839
But I didn't do my research

165
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,619
Table had a single post right so when I went to jump off it like some bugs bunny cap and I started running and if

166
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,779
You [played] the frame by frame you'll see me going [down]

167
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:46,389
There's just a lone chair and you guys notice I can do the splits. Oh go split the bangbang [text] testicle. [oh]

168
00:13:50,599 --> 00:13:55,059
Five days later. I'm compressing a lot of time. We I didn't go to the hospital. I didn't think was a big deal

169
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:59,618
I was at my friend's house, and I'm swollen at this point and one of my friends back in, Ohio

170
00:13:59,619 --> 00:14:04,779
We had split up was like hey does your does your testicle. Look like this avocado. [I] was like funny

171
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:08,438
It does look like that like you need to a hospital basically call

172
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,548
Went to the hospital and you know my mom's like what do why didn't you show me?

173
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:15,908
Why I'm like mom, not showing you my balls to my bed if it's at one point. She's like

174
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:20,619
I'm not gonna be able have grandchildren. [we] were worried [about] getting my testicle removed no guy wants one testicle

175
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:24,548
I'll do it but no you don't want [to] doc gives me an ultrasound and he comes up [and] he's like okay

176
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:28,538
Good news and bad news the good news is [that] you're not going to have to get it removed the bad news is that you?

177
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:29,899
Have a three-inch

178
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:35,798
Hematoma sitting at the bottom of your testicle that we will have to perform surgery and remove for all the guys listening

179
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:40,478
I'm sorry. This is like you will lose a testicle or part of it at some point in your life fact

180
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:44,589
I don't know what that statistical analysis is coming from it's a hundred percent true

181
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,778
I can verify the day of the surgery I go in and the homeboy the doctors outlining his procedure

182
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:50,109
Yeah

183
00:14:50,109 --> 00:14:55,719
We're going to go in we're going to remove the hematoma and if enough of it is dead your testicle of course [will] just go

184
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,079
Ahead and remove it I did

185
00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,358
What would you just say that because you told me you told me I was not getting my test

186
00:15:01,359 --> 00:15:03,668
[II] removed because well that was the original plan

187
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:09,098
But if enough of it is dead where we are gonna have to pull this so I literally woke up for my surgery

188
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:14,528
Not knowing if I had two testicles, I'm holding my mom's pant. I go mom just
