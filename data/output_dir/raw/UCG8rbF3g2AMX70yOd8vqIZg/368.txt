the platform now in like Hollywood

191
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,390
business terms that means it was the

192
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,930
most viewed videos that was sponsored

193
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,260
this was a bad idea that that's what you do

194
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,940
when you're completely out of ideas

195
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,740
right and you're just like "yo I need

196
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,480

197
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,320
