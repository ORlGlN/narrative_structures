1
00:00:07,573 --> 00:00:09,442
Whoo!

2
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:11,677
- Yeah!
- ( donkey braying )

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,614
Oh, yeah!

4
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,417
Sweet!
That was awesome.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,654
<i> ( music playing )</i>

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:24,624
Yeah!
Whoo!

7
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:28,428
Run it, dude.
Yes!

8
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:31,564
Run!
Go, go, go!

9
00:00:31,597 --> 00:00:33,132
( laughing )

10
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:34,167
Whoo!

11
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:56,856
- That was awesome, dude.
- Dude, awesome.

12
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,324
- What did you guys think?
- Nailed it.

13
00:00:58,357 --> 00:00:59,859
All right,
so we got this boy Angelo.

14
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:01,661
His mom sent in this video.

15
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:03,129
He's in a wheelchair.

16
00:01:03,162 --> 00:01:04,764
He loves to be active.

17
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:06,332
- He can ride wheelies
 and do 360s.
- Whoa.

18
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:07,500
This boy's awesome.

19
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:09,535
He deserves an epic day.

20
00:01:09,568 --> 00:01:11,604
An epic couple days.

21
00:01:11,637 --> 00:01:13,873
I am Angelo Moss.

22
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:16,642
I'm 16 years old and
I'm in the 11th grade.

23
00:01:16,675 --> 00:01:18,511
<i> I am in a wheelchair because</i>

24
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:21,547
<i> I am an amputee
 and I have spina bifida.</i>

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,649
<i> Spina bifida restricts
 a lot of people</i>

26
00:01:23,682 --> 00:01:25,751
<i> 'cause they won't be able
 to use their legs as much,</i>

27
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:27,587
<i> so I work around that</i>

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:30,123
<i> and use my arms and upper body
 a lot more.</i>

29
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:32,425
Life has been awesome!

30
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:33,860
<i> I'm very active,</i>

31
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,795
<i> I love playing sports because</i>

32
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,697
<i> it just brings me happiness,</i>

33
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,765
<i> makes me keep going.</i>

34
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:40,833
Whoo!

35
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,869
I love basketball a lot

36
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,471
because I have so much speed.

37
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:48,741
<i> How I play sports is
 with my own chair</i>

38
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,676
unless they let me
borrow one.

39
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:53,479
This chair might
break in a while.

40
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,648
Lilliana:<i> I am nominating
 for Angelo to have
 a day of fun,</i>

41
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,450
<i> where he can continue to smile</i>

42
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,218
and the world can see...

43
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:01,754
the joy...

44
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:05,158
and the energy
that Angelo radiates...

45
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,926
out of his little soul.

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,829

47
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:11,464

48
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:16,202
<i> We are</i>

49
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,304
headed to Angelo's house
right now.

50
00:02:18,337 --> 00:02:20,806
I'm so pumped
to meet this kid.

51
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,643
Like, I can't wait to give
this kid an epic adventure.

52
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,911
You always do.

53
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:26,179
You give me an epic
adventure every day.

54
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:27,346
( laughs )

55
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,348
All right, so I'm gonna
call Lilliana,

56
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:31,450
that's his mom,
and give her the heads up
that we're on the way.

57
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,785
Lilliana:<i>
 Hello?</i>

58
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:34,420
Is this Lilliana?

59
00:02:34,453 --> 00:02:35,755
Yes, it is.

60
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:36,889
<i> So, we're like
 three minutes out.</i>

61
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:39,759
I'm super, super excited.

62
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,460
The boys have no idea.

63
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:43,362
I hope he's ready
for a great day.

64
00:02:43,395 --> 00:02:44,564
<i> Okay, we'll see you soon.</i>

65
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,865
Yeah, this is gonna be great.

66
00:02:45,898 --> 00:02:47,900
I always know
I'm really excited

67
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,435
when I actually get nervous

68
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:50,703
'cause I don't
get nervous easy.

69
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,438
All right, stop here,
stop here, stop here.

70
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,706
I don't want him to see us.

71
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,575
<i> ( music playing )</i>

72
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:00,680
Yo!

73
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:01,881
Oh, my God!

74
00:03:01,914 --> 00:03:03,416
What's up?

75
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,517
- What's up, my man?
- Hi.

76
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,585
- How are you?
- Good.

77
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,520
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Mom.

78
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:08,921
- How are you?
- Good, and yourself?

79
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:09,989
I'm awesome.

80
00:03:10,022 --> 00:03:11,791
I'm so excited
to meet you guys.

81
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:14,594
I can already tell we're gonna
have a lot fun with these guys.

82
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:16,829
Strike me out.

83
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:18,698
- Oh!
- ( laughs )

84
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,266
I just ruined the game.

85
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,267
I'm out.

86
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,835
So what's going on here?

87
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,403
This is my basketball chair,

88
00:03:24,436 --> 00:03:25,771
this is another
basketball chair,

89
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,240
and this is
my hand cycle.

90
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:28,975
- Whoa, this one looks cool.
- Yeah.

91
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:30,876
You're gonna have to show me how
to do a wheelie or something.

92
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,845
Oh, I should take
him down there.

93
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:33,980
Yeah, let's go.

94
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,748
- Don't touch the wheel.
- All right.

95
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,250
Yo.
( laughing )

96
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,851
Yo, where--

97
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:39,852
Whoo!

98
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:41,587
Dude, we're drifting!

99
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,623
And that chair's obviously
built for, like, romping.

100
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:44,890
No, not at all.

101
00:03:44,923 --> 00:03:46,525
Angelo's out here killing it.

102
00:03:46,558 --> 00:03:47,760
He does tricks.

103
00:03:47,793 --> 00:03:49,428
I'd just fall
and hurt myself.

104
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:50,997
Probably.

105
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,465
Well, we've seen the tricks,

106
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:53,833
we've seen the skills.

107
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,668
Show me around.
Let's see your place.

108
00:03:55,701 --> 00:03:57,336
This your place?

109
00:03:57,369 --> 00:03:58,938
Yeah. Hold on.

110
00:03:58,971 --> 00:03:59,972
Dude!

111
00:04:00,005 --> 00:04:01,507
( laughs )

112
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,642
What did you just do?

113
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,310
- You're used to it.
- Yeah.

114
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,678
You're like,
"That's what he does."

115
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:06,912
- That was fast.
- Yeah.

116
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:08,514
- Wicked fast.
- He's super speedy.

117
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,349
This is the place, huh?

118
00:04:10,382 --> 00:04:11,884
Lilliana:<i>
 Apartment's really,
 really tiny,</i>

119
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:14,387
<i> and so we kind of share
 space all together.</i>

120
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,022
<i> I have a day bed,
 it has a trundle,</i>

121
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,324
<i> so one child
 will sleep with me.</i>

122
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:21,560
- This is the bed, it pulls out,
 so we have two beds.
- Right on.

123
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:23,696
Well, look, man, we're gonna
have some serious fun.

124
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,431
- I can tell.
- There's nothing
  I want to do more

125
00:04:25,464 --> 00:04:28,467
than just give you guys
a great time.

126
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,568
It's all we got to do.

127
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:31,003
Lilliana:
That's all that counts.

128
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:32,872
If you guys want, I want
to take you to a skate park.

129
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:34,073
Okay, that would be perfect.

130
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:35,074
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

131
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:36,542
Fun in the sun, baby.

132
00:04:36,575 --> 00:04:37,576
Lilliana:
Let's get ready.

Man:<i>
 Hello?</i>

<i> Just went to their house.</i>

He's got to actually
climb up stairs

139
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,789
to even get in his house.

140
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,424
There's no wheelchair
accessibility.

141
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:52,992
<i> Oh, my gosh.</i>

142
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,994
<i> I'm thinking, like,
 you go apartment hunting.</i>

143
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:57,363
- Apartment hunting?
- They need space.

144
00:04:57,396 --> 00:04:59,465
<i> A nice place

145
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,033

Let's hit that skate park.

<i> skate in this park together.
 It's awesome.</i>

- Yes.

It's like the biggest
skate park I've ever been to.

Angelo:<i>
 It's ginormous.</i>

Roman:<i>
 This doesn't look
 too intimidating?</i>

00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,710
- Angelo: Somewhat.
- As a mom, it does.

171

Who's the one guy
that does this?

172
00:05:46,178 --> 00:05:47,613
His name is Aaron.

173
00:05:47,646 --> 00:05:48,914
He's amazing.

174
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,616
He did the first back flip
on a wheelchair.

175
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:51,684
Crazy.

176
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:53,419

179

Hi, Aaron!

180
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,659
Hey.

181
00:06:00,692 --> 00:06:02,061
Angelo, how's it going, bro?

182
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:03,596
Good to meet you.

183
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,464
You know what you just
got yourself into?

184
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,032
- (laughter )
- Yeah. 

185
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:08,968
Aaron's here to have
some fun with you, like...

186
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:11,003
- Dope.
- Give you some tips,
 some tricks.

187
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,972
- Let's send it.
- Let's go.

188
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,108
<i> It's Aaron.
 This is crazy.</i>

189
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,877
I'm a big fan,
he's pretty awesome.

190
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,945
<i> This day can't
 get any better.</i>

191
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:22,148
I definitely think you can
do this one wheelie.

192
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,083
- Like the one-wheel manual.
- Okay.

193
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:25,985
Just, like, go fast
and pull it up.

194
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,453
That's crazy.

195
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:29,455
And then keep pushing
the other one.

196
00:06:29,488 --> 00:06:31,490
- Okay.
- So the one that's
 on the ground, just...

197
00:06:31,523 --> 00:06:32,992
- So like that? ( screams )
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,460
( laughs )

199
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,761
Roman: I love
that he loves falling.

200
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:37,863
- That's the first step.
- Oh, you got this.

201
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:39,732
All right, so while
they're having a good time,

202
00:06:39,765 --> 00:06:41,867
<i> Aaron's, like, giving him
 some lessons, some pointers...</i>

203
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,469
Oh!

204
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:45,538
But I think Angelo
needs a better chair,

205
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:46,906
with, like suspension,
like Aaron's,

206
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,940
so we got this.

207
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:50,910
Boom.

208
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:52,111
Aaron:
Yo, he's getting it.

209
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,514
- Yo, you want to
 try this one out?
- Yeah.

210
00:06:55,547 --> 00:06:56,982
This looks pretty sweet?

211
00:06:57,015 --> 00:06:58,984
- Yeah.
- Right here.

212
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:01,053
A new chair?
This is crazy.

213
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:02,121
Feels great.

214
00:07:02,154 --> 00:07:03,122
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

215
00:07:03,155 --> 00:07:05,057
This new chair is amazing.

216
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,726
<i> It's especially
 designed for skating.</i>

217
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,695
<i> Yes! Just what I needed.</i>

218
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:12,064
You got some suspension
in the front wheels,

219
00:07:12,097 --> 00:07:14,200
and then you got
the springs in the back,

220
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,069
so makes those landings
a little less rough.

221
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,737
You want to carve some bowls?

222
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,738
Sure, why not?

223
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:21,507
I like that.

224
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,843
<i> ( music playing )</i>

225
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:25,177
Oh, yeah.

226
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,745
Yeah, he's not afraid
to go fast.

227
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:29,849
That was crazy fast.

228
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:30,916
Man, keep pushing.

Wow.

<i> There's no boundaries,
 there's no limitation.</i>

233
00:07:37,122 --> 00:07:39,091
<i> He's good.
 It gives me great joy</i>

234
00:07:39,124 --> 00:07:40,593

he has such a big smile.

235
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,027
You see him happy.

236

<i> 'Cause no matter
 what he goes through,</i>

237
00:07:43,295 --> 00:07:44,864
<i> he's always smiling</i>

238

<i> and he never lets
 anything stop him.</i>

- You want to try and
 drop in on coping?
- Sure.

240

When you go over the edge,
you want to

241
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:52,071
- just kind of
 keep the front up.
- Okay.

242
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,672
Just real smooth-like.

243

Yes.

Just try to turn
and lean on that one wheel.

246
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:02,781
You make it look so easy.

247
00:08:02,814 --> 00:08:04,717
No. Ugh.

248
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,851

No pressure, buddy.

256

- No pressure?
- No pressure at all.

257

No pressure, but land it.

No way.

That was nuts.

You both looked
crazy out there,

Completely unstoppable.

of Aaron's back flip?

270
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:41,953
It was cool!

271
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:43,121
You're gonna do
a back flip someday.

272
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,256
Yeah, someday,

273
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:45,925
but not today,
that's for sure.

274

275
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,661
The chair is pretty cool.

that encouraging.

Oh, he was dropping in...

drop in here?

new today...

There's no way he could this.
