00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,870
on tour with you because there was there

236
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,970

237
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,260
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys will understand it</font>

238
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,130
doesn't sound rude there was no use<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

239
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,230
him on this tour<font color="#E5E5E5"> also he has his own</font>

240
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,630
stuff he has to do but we both agreed

241
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he I'd be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distracted because</font>

242
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,610
I'd be like I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> always want to make</font>

243
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,319
sure he was okay because performing in

244
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,660
theaters aren't in his element they're

245
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,350
not what he does he's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a theater</font>

246
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,240
person so I'd always be concerned he's

247
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,399
he felt he'd be a distraction and I was

248
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,990
