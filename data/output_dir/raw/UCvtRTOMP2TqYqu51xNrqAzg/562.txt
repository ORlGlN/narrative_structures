10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,010
speaking uh for myself because who knows

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,750

17
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,460
crazy uh all the matchups should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

18
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,140

east<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so let me pick my winner is</font>

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:49,770
really quick before I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into details</font>

give you my surprise really<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick the</font>

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,359
Charlotte Hornets let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start off with</font>

24
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,149
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cavs and Detroit Pistons obviously</font>

25
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,890
Cleveland<font color="#E5E5E5"> LeBron James Kyrie Irving</font>

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,220
Kevin Love let me just say this the

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,439
Detroit Pistons are no joke<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

28
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,229
Detroit Pistons have a squad they have

29
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,580
players who can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> play ball let</font>

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,310
me say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this I'm picking the Cavs in six</font>

31
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,290
games I think LeBron goes into Detroit

32
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,970
and closes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out at the palace in Game</font>

33
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,150
six just like it's good old days but if

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:34,290
like Kyrie needs to step up Kyrie they

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,650
need 2014-15 Kyrie they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need 2016</font>

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,750
Kyrie it's he's been inconsistent just

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,860
he has not been Kyrie Irving he's it

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,140
Kevin Love

39
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,270
they need Kevin they need a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin</font>

40
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,130
Love let me just say this another thing

41
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,110
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> andre drummond shot closer to</font>

42
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty percent rather than eight percent</font>

43
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,220
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free-throw line i might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

44
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,080
goes to picking the Pistons but Andre

45
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,670
Drummond struggles I'm not saying

46
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:00,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">free-throws change the whole game but</font>

47
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,610
you cannot leave them in in the fourth

48
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,930
quarter oh they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna hack him</font>

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,970
free throw shooting<font color="#CCCCCC"> is terrible I do</font>

50
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,840
think Detroit squeaks out two wins in

51
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,919
this series<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't think they could</font>

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,420
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cleveland i'm picking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cleveland in</font>

53
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,550
six this is LeBron James let's not

54
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,319
forget you've heard all this Steph<font color="#CCCCCC"> Curry</font>

55
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,239
all year<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know Kevin Durant Anthony</font>

56
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,400
Davis Kobe 60-point game but let's not

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">forget there's a guy named LeBron James</font>

58
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,030
who still plays in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this league and it's</font>

59
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,260
still one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best players in the NBA</font>

60
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,690
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my head he's still the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

61
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,420
player in the NBA anyways<font color="#E5E5E5"> I digress</font>

62
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">toronto raptors vs indiana pacers man</font>

63
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,209
this one every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you think the</font>

64
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,300
Raptors are ready to you know okay Lowry

65
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,239
Prime DeRozan stepping up every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

66
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:43,430
think the Raptors<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta squat I don't</font>

67
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,420
want to say they have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of</font>

68
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,739
choking in the playoffs because there's

69
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:49,100
not much history recently about that but

70
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,750
last year was bad for them in the

71
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,030
playoffs but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year they just got too</font>

72
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,790
much talent<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've been like I think</font>

73
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,220
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> choked history stops this year</font>

74
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,260
lowry and derozan one of the best

75
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,700
backwards in the league if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,829
second best um I mean they're the what

77
00:03:06,829 --> 00:03:08,780
just named Norman Powell fucking stick

78
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,760
around rookies coming out of nowhere

79
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,410
he's a contributor on that team i'm

80
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,570
picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raptors in i'm gonna go raptors</font>

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,780
and seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think they could close</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

82
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,019
out in six I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go Raptors in seven</font>

83
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,950
but um<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i don't think the</font>

84
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,180
patients are<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna beat them but the</font>

85
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">patients could put up a fight I don't</font>

86
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,630
know the Raptors are too strong this

87
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,950
year they were they were right<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind</font>

88
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,420
right on the Cleveland Cavaliers<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font>

89
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,010
for that first seed in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> East but</font>

90
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,739
anyways yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going raptures they got</font>

91
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:41,000
a pretty good squad especially with

92
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,590
Carol coming back they could really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

93
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,269
him he's a playoff type of player he's

94
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,950
like a PJ Tucker but obviously way more

95
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,959
offensive game ok let's go uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Boston</font>

96
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">Celtics in Atlanta Hawks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah</font>

97
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,969
I said the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hawks right Boston I don't</font>

98
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:03,890
know guys because the Hogs have some

99
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:05,870
looming free agents big name is

100
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,359
specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> al horford they've been up</font>

101
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:09,799
and down this year they've been bouncing

102
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,959
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> third to sixth the fifth to fourth</font>

103
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">I picked can I change my mind no I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

104
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:19,339
gonna change<font color="#E5E5E5"> my mind Boston is actually</font>

105
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,108
Boston with Evan Turner coming off the

106
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,139
bench Isaiah Tom no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go Boston</font>

107
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,639
still really young Atlanta has that

108
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,960
experience going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the eastern</font>

109
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,150
conference finals last year I'm going

110
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,770
fuck this series is too hard to predict

111
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,479
why you gotta put<font color="#CCCCCC"> bro wottus on the spot</font>

112
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:40,220
like that um shit all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm going</font>

113
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,849
Hawks in seven and that's only because

114
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,530
they have home court that's it that's

115
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:47,330
the only reason home court advantage I

116
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,840
think man I'm so I love<font color="#CCCCCC"> Isaiah Thomas I</font>

117
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,910
want to pick Boston so bad but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

118
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,949
Hawks in seven I think the Hawks<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

119
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,500
had that experience but Brad Stevens

120
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,900
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> head</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coach if anyone can bring out</font>

121
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best in younger players it's Brad</font>

122
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:05,060
Stevens so I don't know guys I'm know

123
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,310
I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go hawks in seven now this</font>

124
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,590
series this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get a lot</font>

125
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,880
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate and I don't want to sound overly</font>

126

Kaminsky pretty good rookie al

155
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,210
Jefferson's back nicolas Batum Nikola

156
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,830
Batum whatever you wanna fuckin call him

157
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,650
he's they gotta find a way to keep him

158
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,840

<font color="#E5E5E5">going Hornets and six I don't see them</font>

160
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:36,330
going into Miami in a game seven and

161
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:38,520
beating miami in their home<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

162
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hornets in six and I'm like it hurts me</font>

163
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,890
to pick this but uh with so many former

164
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,870
Phoenix Suns guys even Luol Deng will

165
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,250
the former<font color="#E5E5E5"> Phoenix and he got drafted by</font>

166
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,350
the sun's traded on draft it so there's

167
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,930

168
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cavs six raptures in seven uh atlanta</font>

169
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,110
hawks and seven and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charlotte</font>

170
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Hornets and six again like I want to</font>

171
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,220
pick raptors and six but imma just go

172
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,780
seven I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close it out in</font>

173
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,210
six but will give the Pacers three games

174
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:08,730
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that series and those are my picks</font>

175
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,490
for the Eastern Conference side and

176
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,500
let's see how I do in this bracket in my

177
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,900
head good after asleep and some

178
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,610
rethinking I changed my mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

179
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,940
raptors and seven on one raptors and six

180
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,500
because unlike previous years where

181
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,300
they've choked in the playoffs this year

182
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,000
they actually have the defense to go

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,530
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with their offense usually their</font>

184
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,450
offense<font color="#E5E5E5"> is strong in their defenses kind</font>

185
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,460
of shaky this year they have the

186
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,190
offensive firepower if not better than

187
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,840
previous years and they also have the

188
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,210
defense then I think they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> match up</font>

189
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,710
well with<font color="#E5E5E5"> India and honestly I will</font>

190
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:46,440
graduate in six and the NBA playoffs

191
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,940
start in 10 minutes for the sixth year

192
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,560
in a row no Phoenix Suns everyone take a

193
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,350
shot to that no Phoenix Suns name a

194
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,090
playoff for six years the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the</font>

195
