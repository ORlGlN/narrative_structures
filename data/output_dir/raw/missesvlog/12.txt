00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,180
Hi i'm Kelly welcome to my channel

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:04,560
This "hi" is always so motivated

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,820
I'm in a really good mode

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,180
Well folks, I was just sitting on my sofa

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,740
and made something I like the most..

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,600
watching Facebook-videos

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,200
I know folks, stop stop stop

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,720
it's a very difficult topic, most of you might think

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,280
Facebook is the worst platform ever existed in the Internet!

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,180
I wasted myself

11
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,960
But there is one thing I do on this platform

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,520
always when I am alone and need time for myself at night...

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,060
And so I thought, why not doing it with you?

14
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:45,400
so I left my bed, put this hat on, 'cause I have oily hair

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:49,240
put my best hoody on (link in description)

16
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,100
and I will try know NOT to react to videos

17
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,400
where I get emotional

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,040
Animal-videos on Facebook!

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,640
I always get in a "spiral of emotions"

20
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,960
because Facebook is automatically sending me to the next video

21
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,460
and I make this for hours, crying, laughing, just having a good time

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,460
but thats exactly what I will try not to do

23
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,000
and you at home can try the same but it will be hard (as ****)

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,300
so I take my mobile phone, with only 14% battery!

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,900
Oh my goodness am I in danger!

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,040
btw. just as all the other Youtubers I removed the case of my I-phone

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,280
because it looks way better

28
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,680
(earlier in this video..)

29
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,520
usually I use protection.. all right

30
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:40,380
lets's see when we first see an animal-video

31
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,380
shouldn't take too long I dont watch anything else

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,080
that's very hard 'cause I love cheese

33
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,040
That's my.. well, have I failed? Yes, I've already failed.

34
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,000
That's my biggest dream of all times that a little puppy comes to me

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,479
that's why I pray every day to Jesus Christ

36
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,940
that he sends me a puppy

37
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:18,100
and than I let him balance things on his head! I will be so happy!

38
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,660
I wanna save a dog from animal shelter too!

39
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,920
Oh s*** people getting puppys for present. That's my end (rude language)

40
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,640
Oh my goodness what was this?

41
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,260
Ohh he's crying

42
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,380
This grandpa also got a puppy and this grandma too!

43
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,500
and this child too!

44
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:10,620
I want one too! (nearly crying)

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,020
look how happy they all are isn't it wounderfull?

46
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,120
That's so cute!

47
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,080
Don't cry!

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,920
Don't blink!

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,320
Maybe I have a problem with dogs

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,920
with dogs and children I can't ignore it my hormones are just so...

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,200
that's the moment of my life I ask myself:

52
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,160
Is it normal to react at these Videos like that?

53
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,535
Am I really the only one out there reacting like this to

54
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,240
the (f******) cutest videos of all time!?

55
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,500
Oh I love this video!

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,540
f***

57
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,220
I had a Rabbit for myself once and I observed him for hours making this!

58
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,500
Kelly in this video you should try NOT to show any reaction!

59
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,940
that's a very hard game by the way

60
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,800
I'm really spitefull with animals

61
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:25,340
it is not his fault!

62
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,960
I like disabled animals

63
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,100
wait I have to get controll over my emotions otherwise I don't have any chance ok?

64
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,640
I try to controll my facial expressions but they always slip away

65
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,800
This videos are the content of my life

66
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,860
what else can I say to this?

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,880
I know it sounds sad... but it's true

68
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
is he happy or not?

69
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,260
what? they already have a baby?

70
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,360
It looks like less one year old is this even possible?

71
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,940
Oh my goodness this is cute!

72
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:51,040
Folks, I don't even want to be pregnant

73
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,540
I've nothing to do with pregnants but still..

74
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,700
I swear I don't have my period.. I swear

75
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,100
I don't know, I always fall into this"spiral of emotions"

76
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,420
I don't know.. (laughing) spiral is a contraceptive

77
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,380
Ohh my goodness!

78
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,520
Why is everything on my Facebook-videos about children and pregnants and dogs?

79
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,960
but I love it!

80
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,820
Oh I'm thirsty I have to take back all my tears

81
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,980
My voice... ok lets go on

82
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,980
Will it be a new format know? just make myself crying?

83
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,020
I just had to put on warmer socks

84
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,540
cause all my energy is concentrated here and is missing there

85
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,740
hippos are one of my favorite animals - not to react to such a video

86
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,440
broke me my heart just for your to know it

87
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,080
I don't mind animals stuck somewhere

88
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,160
no mercy

89
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,920
I don't care about the kitty

90
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,100
people passionately trying to save it, I don't care

91
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,060
wow.. it's free

92
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,460
Oh my goodness thats me every saturday evening

93
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,960
Ohh my goodness!

94
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,100
Do you know what I mean? There is something with Facebook-videos killing me

95
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,800
I hope you enjoyed it, I just thought I  could share my passion with you

96
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,160
Even if I can't controll my emotions

97
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,400
but maybe it will get better

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,720
