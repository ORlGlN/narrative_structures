00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
Hey guys, it's Kelly!

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,480
HALLOWEEN!!!

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,040
What belongs to Halloween? To paint your face.

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,460
CREEPPYYY

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,980
It has to be creepy! I made a video like that about two years ago already

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:13,480
The only issue is that the video was a total disaster

7
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,600
But today we're doing the makeup of "IT" anyways.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,200
I always like to test out YouTube- tutorials, to see if they are really that easy to recreate.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,460
By the way, I'm using kid's paint- HALLOWEEN

10
00:00:24,255 --> 00:00:26,895
Wow, now I look like I smoked pot.

11
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,160
That's always the weirdest part ever.

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,880
It just doesn't feel right.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,880
I think my genetics are really similar to one of an albino. Like really!

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,300
That`s totally me in january.

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,080
Those people who draw on their eyebrows every single day... how do they do that?

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,080
I also have to make a shadow on my forehead.

17
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,700
It looks like third eyebrow.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,440
 

19
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,320
GREAT! now I rubbed off the white color.

20
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:03,140
I better don't do anything. This should look like something like that.

21
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:07,820
But it reminds me of:"Ron you've got dirt on your nose"

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,040
It dosn`t look pretty. A bit eyeshadow

23
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,820
I want to be a pretty clown.

24
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,900
I know, it doesnÂ´t look like..., but wait for it...

25
00:01:17,255 --> 00:01:20,155
waiting definitly wasn't worth it. (haha IT i'm not  funny)

26
00:01:20,335 --> 00:01:21,365
Crap

27
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:24,905
Okay, come on concentration. I really try.

28
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,755
I will blend it, I will blend it, don`t worry!

29
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:30,645
Can it be true that this brush isn`t for the eye?

30
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:34,600
Let`s go to the lascivious lips from the `It` clown.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,835
He has got a bit Kylie Jenner action

32
00:01:36,835 --> 00:01:39,935
on his lips. What is that?

33
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:42,745
Every year I ask myself, how this sh... I am sorry

34
00:01:42,745 --> 00:01:45,545
How this beautiful people at YouTube

35
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:48,875
make this tutorials. How can they do it so perfect?

36
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,685
I don't have talent for it. I just saw he has got

37
00:01:51,685 --> 00:01:54,285
red lips and not purple ones.

38
00:01:54,285 --> 00:01:57,025
This packaging is red! So I get excited!

39
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:00,005
It gets worse and worse. So I

40
00:02:00,005 --> 00:02:02,805
stop. They all use lipstick and I use lipgloss.

41
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:05,720
When yo think about it, it wasn`t the best idea

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,320
because lipgloss is more liquid then lipstick.

43
00:02:08,324 --> 00:02:11,235
But do think about something before I do it? No!

44
00:02:11,235 --> 00:02:14,115
I really tried making these tops.

45
00:02:14,115 --> 00:02:17,115
Why she makes so good tops. I wasted 10 minutes for them.

46
00:02:17,135 --> 00:02:20,135
When they get away?

47
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:21,135
Dafuq?

48
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,375
It looks like a slug slide over my face.

49
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,365
It looks creepy because it is

50
00:02:30,365 --> 00:02:31,500
made horrendous bad

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,220
the door just rang and I

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,000
can`t open the door, when I look like that.

53
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,620
I just can`t

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,780
Oh it`s not so bad. i don't think it's as bad as i thought before

55
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,015
Oh its to fat, like me after I

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,015
was in america. It is okay, or?

57
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,620
many people think I make intentionally everything so bad

58
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,935
for making the video funny.

59
00:02:58,935 --> 00:03:01,765
And I am really sad about it, because I try

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,440
really. In 100% of it.

61
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,820
I've just sat on my makeup

62
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,200
Pennywise now has a wild hairstyle of red hair

63
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
but i dont have red hair

64
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:16,220
you know other youtubers order everything online

65
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,140
I'm doing a lot of recycling

66
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,640
BOOM

67
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,780
and thats it for my halloween IT aka Pennywise Make up tutorial

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,660
 

69
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,920
soooo...it is definitly horrible....

70
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,580
it is okay its not that bad

71
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,220
its just looks really shitty

72
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,220
DONT FORGET to look at the discription for your "Clickbait" merch

73
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,680

74
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,865

75
00:03:41,865 --> 00:00:00,000
