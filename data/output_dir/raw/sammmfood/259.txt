you're going to post it and then you

221
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,690
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with the creative ideas</font>

222
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,390
within their guidelines one of their

223
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:59,120
guidelines was that it had to be some

224
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,420
medium chunky salsa<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did also by mild</font>

225

230
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I put the towel underneath to kind of</font>

254
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:45,949
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> house savings I think all of our</font>

255
00:11:45,949 --> 00:11:47,180
instagrams in general should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just start</font>

256
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,949
going there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> videos and things</font>

257
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:52,399
will pay for our business so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

258
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,019

that I didn't cover I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of went over</font>

260
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,579
that quickly let me know and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> cover</font>

261
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:00,439
it in another video when you do an

262
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,629
integration with the company they

263
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:03,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually pay you just like a flat fee</font>

264
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,230
there are some that I think we might

265
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,939
start working with with gin mill with

266
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:10,579
makeup that you pay pay you per like and

267
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,740
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> engagement so be for every like you</font>

268
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,329
get paid a certain amount which is kind

269
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:16,279
of intense it'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to see</font>

270
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,990
how that goes hopefully we can continue

271
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,209
to work with cool companies push out fun

272
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:23,059
cool content it's basically like a bonus

273
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:24,740
picture instead of there being nothing

274
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,439
posted at all you get an extra picture

275
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,180
like that so after we eat i'm going to

276
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,559
edit it really quick and commit it to

277
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:32,480
them that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hardest part</font>

278
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">for me is that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm in the photo I'm</font>

281
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,630

283
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:45,300
