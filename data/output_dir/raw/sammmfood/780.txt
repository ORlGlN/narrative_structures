110
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,860
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stanley Cup it's crazy after all</font>

111
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,390
the joking around that our teams are

112
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,160
facing each other again but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

113
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,040
bet the loser has to wear the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposing</font>

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,130
team's shirt maybe we get a jersey

115
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:28,770
sweater involved i'm not sure but for

116
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,100
four straight days wherever they go

117
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">vlogging not sure if they have to wear</font>

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,530
it to sleep maybe in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shower too I'm</font>

119
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,160
nice but they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear it for four</font>

120
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,480
straight days and then one<font color="#CCCCCC"> day at VidCon</font>

121
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,430
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> vlogger fair depending on which we're</font>

122
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,110
both at will will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at VidCon and</font>

123
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:49,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">blogger</font>

124
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:51,800
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I threw in that the loser should</font>

125
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,050
send the winner something from their

126
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,270
hometown so in this case I would order

127
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:59,860
Danny like portillos<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italian beef or a</font>

128
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,689
deep-dish pizza a little does he know

129
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,969
though is if I were to lose I'd probably

130
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:07,759
order it at VidCon or at vloggerfair so

131
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,219
I could enjoy it with them so I'm not

132
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:11,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure what he would say in from sent from</font>

133
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,529
Tampa Bay Cuban sandwiches fish people

134
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:16,939
from Tampa Bay what he has known for

135
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:20,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyways that's our bet and I better way</font>
