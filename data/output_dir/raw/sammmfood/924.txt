appointment and it went<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you did</font>

109
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,400
really well with his<font color="#E5E5E5"> shots he just cried</font>

110
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,509
a little but no tears or anything Carol

111
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,490
but he's super healthy and strong she

112
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,949
said sorry for me but he will probably

113
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:14,020
walking sooner rather than later he'll

114
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,150
be walking before a year is what she

115
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,009
meant it was what she was saying he'll

116
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,400
be walking soon which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not surprised</font>

117
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,740
because I guess his motor skills are

118
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,349
advanced like his III don't really know

119
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">how it all works or what they look for I</font>

120
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,759
guess he's gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> walking sooner than</font>

121
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,270
later and I'm happy for him but I'm not
