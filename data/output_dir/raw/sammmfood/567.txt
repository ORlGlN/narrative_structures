00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580

5
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,320
right now of the penny no bronzer no

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,840
filter straight up the penny in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,690
flesh aside from the penny my first

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,600
thought when I look at this monument I

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,660
think of the hollow me focus I think of

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,090
the Martin Luther King I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dream</font>

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,700
speech which happened right here this

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">wasn't filled with people a huge moment</font>

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,430
in history with lace the city is just

14
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,280
felt like stuff like that to me we hold

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,309
these truths to be self-evident that all

16
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:10,860
men are created I have a dream my four

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,439
little children will one day live in a

18
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,659
nation where they will not be judged by

19
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,490
the color of their skin but by the

20
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:19,799
content of their character I have a

21
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,380
dream today all the ester I kept

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,240
thinking like just get to the next day

23
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,189
just get to tomorrow just get to

24
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">tomorrow cuz I wasn't so much pain I</font>

25
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:32,369
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a flu and like</font>

26
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:34,979
sometimes with flus you get really achy

27
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,310
but this was like excruciating pain and

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,890
the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> day in my back I just could</font>

29
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,229
not it would not stop like I didn't have

30
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:46,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">one moment of like okay can breathe like</font>

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,240
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just need a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minute it wasn't until</font>

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,570
like 11 12 when I finally took some

33
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,360

<font color="#E5E5E5">taking tylenol all day sometimes I</font>

36
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,119
forget like what medicine I can and

37
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,490
can't take being pregnant but we had

38
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:07,950

day but I just thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flu I</font>

40
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,760
really did turns out it could possibly

41
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,140
be a kidney infection

42
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,420
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a minor</font>

43
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,230
one but man smaller big whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,700
is so painful I don't wish it upon

45
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,670
anyone I like you couldn't even touch my

46
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,290
