157
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,640

159
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,620
just didn't seem like the same as Noah's

160
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,910
it seemed<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of restricted</font>

161
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,330

168
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,020
like it does take her like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

169
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,580
seconds to latch on and things like that

170
