it won't accept my SD card I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

116
00:06:09,449 --> 00:06:10,919
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I might have to get a</font>

that we're gonna set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at VidCon so</font>

119
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:18,030
that people get<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the full experience</font>

120
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,789
of what's going on here right now let me

121
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:22,979
pull this off<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here right now is a</font>

122
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,139
live look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what that camera is</font>

123
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:29,159
capturing now if I screw up focus come

124
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:32,039
back if I scroll around you can see oh

125
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,870
there's me on top now like we're getting

126
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">a 360 view this area up here would</font>

127
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,210
usually be stitched to this bottom one

128
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,820
and then on the YouTube player if you're

129
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,440
on your phone or on Chrome or something

130
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,150
like that you'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to scroll around</font>

131
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,470
and view the whole room the idea behind

132
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,090
bringing one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these to VidCon is that</font>

133
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,680
we can set it up somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

134
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,180
guys can feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you're there because</font>

135
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,890
you can scroll around the entire room

136
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,230
and see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on I think the main</font>

137
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,450
use of it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at the tricks in booth</font>

138
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,210
it's a really big booth so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we set</font>

139
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,210
this up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it just streaming or</font>

140
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,830
just capturing footage for an hour or so

141
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,680
it'll be cool to just watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it see you</font>

142
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,300
stopped by people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up to the</font>

143
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">camera but like what's up and you can</font>

144
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,540
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scroll around and almost be like</font>

145
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,070
you're there I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people talk</font>

146
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,180
about how they can't get there because

147
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,660
of flights tickets are like crazy

148
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,860
expensive than her to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> already sold</font>

149
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,050
out right now this all about I think

150
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,970
it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of fun to try out if it</font>

151
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,340
will accept my SD card still working on

152
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,560
