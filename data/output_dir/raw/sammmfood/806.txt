00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:38,000
green because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been raining a lot</font>

00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,990
air aiming down at me but in this case

91
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,660
we were at a higher level at times than

92
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,260
the nerd bird so the camera sometimes

93
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,290
was almost like tilted<font color="#E5E5E5"> more down and so</font>
