180
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,570
chiropractor appointment and it was

181
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,520
great I noticed actually yesterday that

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,950
he didn't seem to be limping as much and

183
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,870
then we went in there today who

184
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,920
something you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been running a little</font>

185
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,330
bit you know cuz he still runs around

186
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,160
quite a bit even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though she said that</font>

187
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,460
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably like lay low but he did</font>

188
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">great he had lots of little pops and she</font>

189
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,270
said that it's just his whole pelvis

190
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,089
area is tight because the right side

191
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:27,950
started compensating for his left side

192
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,400
which was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a side that was is kind</font>

193
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,510
of injured i guess i would say so um

194
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,350
he's rolled tight off of the pelvis area

195
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,200
but other than that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> he stretched him</font>

196
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,440
out and adjusted him and he looks a lot

197
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,089
better she also likes feeling better<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

198
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:49,400
was seen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a lot of</font>

199
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">different flus and sicknesses can affect</font>

200
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,280
joints and stuff so I'm kind of hoping

201
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,070
that's just what it was I

202
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,750
a really bad flu once and it affected my

203
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,730
whole back I got sharp pains in my spine

204
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,460
so glad oh yeah what<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna go get lunch</font>

205
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay well he's not too good at a pain</font>

206
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:12,160
to take no I'm hoping that's all it was

207
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,500
I asked her<font color="#CCCCCC"> if she thought it was</font>

208
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,750
serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> methods like x-rays or anything</font>

209
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,060
if she said<font color="#CCCCCC"> no she said that she didn't</font>

210
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> he needed x-rays as right now</font>

211
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,860
because we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen improvement since</font>

212
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,710
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> just two days ago so it's good i'm</font>

213
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,370
hoping the more he he<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets better</font>

214
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,560
sickness wise the more his joints and

215
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,570
everything are healing he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really</font>

216
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,930
tight in his pelvis he was saying so
