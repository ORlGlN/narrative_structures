192
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,449

stuff I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't see it happen but</font>

196
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,999
like the video the way it takes place it

197
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,879
really brought me back to that and one

198
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the dads in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the film tation and he</font>

because I can handle it it was very

207
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:50,079
eye-opening that movie because I feel

208
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,339
like it's something people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

209
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:53,379
think about because it's so sad and like

210
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,540
heartbreaking and summer guess I just
