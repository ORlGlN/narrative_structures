00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,440
Justice him and his hips and stuff so

66
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,060

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,660
still walking with a limp um we have no

68
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,930
idea how this even happened but um

69
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,160
something's not quite right in his hips

70
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
and she said that could be the cause why

71
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,900
he we can't kick like the sicknesses and

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,200
why he like got something so fast again

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,520
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when your body's like out</font>

172
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,480
love cooking but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardest part for me</font>

173
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,520
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting all this together so this is</font>

174
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,590
a huge help I'm always bad at picking

175
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,240
out produce I think Jen's a lot better

176
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,010
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening me too so this makes it</font>

177
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,660
easier for me when I want to make a

178
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,450
sweet meal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our blue apron meals have</font>

179
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,940
always been our best meals I've ever

180
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,910

other night was pretty good i mean that

182
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,880
was that because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was so slippery</font>

183
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,540
close so all of these meals are chef

184
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,820
inspired and they're always changing too

185
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,920
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you go online to pick</font>

186
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,930

187
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,340

242
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,260
little bit anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> she's still limping</font>

243
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:55,019
quite a bit today at afternoon which she

244
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,820
said he<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably would proceed eel but</font>

245
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:00,120
Thor don't see young to understand what

246
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,100
those words mean like sore and like

247
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">anyway he has only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had feel any pain</font>

248
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,899
which was good like I said earlier on

249
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,360
the doctor felt like he should be like

250
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,130
thought he would be experiencing more

251
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,370
pain than he is so I don't know we're

252
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,279
gonna do treatments<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm all want</font>

253
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,079
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be actors now but said talk to the</font>

254
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:20,690
chiropractor and my dad and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my dad said</font>

255
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that uh to wait two weeks until after</font>

256
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,649
those treatments to see then if you

257
00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:28,620
still one thing that's make sense wait

258
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,060
until<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Truman's over and see how he</font>

259
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,310
does with them and then go from there

260
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,399
but kind of it makes me insane nervous

261
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,060
only because this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

262
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,560
could affect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of his life really</font>

263
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,110
you know I mean like if she's having hip

264
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,839
issues I'm grateful one that we're

265
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,149
discovering them now like at the

266
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:50,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">beginning of the hip issue but we're</font>

267
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,230
also really praying and hoping that it's

268
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,980
just tightness and that it's an easy fix

269
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,079
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's no hip dysplasia or</font>

270
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,940
anything like that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

271
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,209
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully he takes well to the</font>

272
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:11,670
treatment what's wrong sick you want a

273
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,089
spoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your own to play in the Orbeez</font>

274
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:23,910
need some tissue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to okay it's cream like</font>

275
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:28,649
your shirt to summarize things we will

276
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:30,540
be taking notes to physical therapy on

277
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,390
Thursday well the chiropractor on

278
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,610
Thursday and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I think on Monday</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

279
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,560
if it continues like Jen said we're

280
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,670
definitely going to get it x-rayed

281
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,770
sometimes when<font color="#E5E5E5"> your parent you prepare</font>

282
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the worst and obviously hope for the</font>

283
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,540
best the past 48 hours doesn't manage

284
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,790
like oh man like this could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

285
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,250
life-changing thing for him we're really

286
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,589
praying and hoping that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

287
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:54,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just like you know just he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

288
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,350
playing and got Bruce or

289
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,690
our spotty just you know recovering from

290
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,660
normal daily things right I think every

291
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,670
parent believes in their child but I

292
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,440
truly believe Noah has a ton of natural

293
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,990
talent natural aptitude to succeed

294
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,020
physically in sports and he just like so

295
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,060
coordinated and I don't want something

296
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,880
to hinder him from that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

297
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,740
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to smoke the best for him and and</font>

298
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,980
whatever he wants to accomplish<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

299
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,600
sometimes and sometimes things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

300
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,240
if it is serious effects your daily life

301
