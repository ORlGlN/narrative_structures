do it real quick and then he can have it

155
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,860
what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone say like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Noah's first</font>

156
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,479
year of life was a musical ocean thing

157
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,090
yeah so the other day when I went and

158
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,159
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> my spider-man costume I decided to</font>

159
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:49,460
fulfill a childhood dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine which</font>

160
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,000
was getting a strobe light a black eye

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,779
and a fog machine right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tested</font>

162
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:01,879
out the fog machine I forgot to grab my

163
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,189
camera I should show you guys it again I

164
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:07,789
plugged it in turn it on and it was a

165
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:10,099
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of smoke a lot of fog almost too</font>

166
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,370
much like I heard neighbors start to go

167
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,330
something on fire like what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

168
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,409
so I quickly turn it off unplugged it

169
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,400
the reason why I got it is because I

170
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,159
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like haunted house</font>

171
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,990

Halloween for<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and thao to go</font>

173
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:29,330
through not like scary but fun something

174
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,849

175
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:33,169
be fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up something in our garage</font>

176
