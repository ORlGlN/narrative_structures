158
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,540
feel like whenever like randomly did a

159
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,310
day when we're at fire grows a family

160
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,410
came in with like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little facemask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

161
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,540
the surgical face<font color="#E5E5E5"> last night and</font>

162
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,890
whenever I see people with those on I'm

<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh are they sick like I'd like to</font>
