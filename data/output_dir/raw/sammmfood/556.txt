155
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:05,029

157

207
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,430

208
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,529
you guys a tour because the store here

209
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,750
is actually opening up pretty soon you

210
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,120
might say<font color="#CCCCCC"> but wait I thought you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

211
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,589
had a store or what happened to the

212
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,779
other store let me tell you we were

213
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,180
actually in a space this way and

214
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,760
that way but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one opened up and</font>

215
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,700
it's a lot nicer<font color="#E5E5E5"> their cross from the</font>

216
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,690
buckle which isn't quite the footlocker

217
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,210
but it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I have a scratch on my</font>

218
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,760
forehead personally I think the space is

219
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,700
a ton nicer it's bigger it's better

220
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,220
there's better space to pack and have

221
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,240
storage and it just looks nicer Logan

222
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,250
Casey and Derek put a ton of work into

223
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">this and I think it looks great so I</font>

224
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:10,920
thought I would give you guys a quick

225
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,560
tour this is the door it's currently

226
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,470
closed because the mall is closed this

227
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,600
is the front display window there's

228
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,240

these real-life mannequins this is

230
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,860
actually my camera I had that with me

231
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,980
when I lived in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Dominican Republic</font>

232
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,610

233
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">anymore got this cool little poster and</font>

234
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040

237
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,850
here another display mannequins thing

238
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:50,580
set up this is kind of like a tribute to

239
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,440
the original store that Shay's grandpa

240
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,540
had it was called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Union so we</font>

241
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,640
created a union line which is very

242
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,250
simplistic give them like hoodies these

243
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,810
are actually some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the original shirts</font>

244
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,459
that they sold at the store these aren't

245
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,860
for sale but just on display so we kind

246
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,390
of created a line to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> tribute to all</font>

247
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,700
that and Tyler to worked a lot on that

248
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool this is one of my</font>

249
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,850

252
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,089
it correctly this was an aeropostale at

253
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:20,070
one point so this might look familiar to

254
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,110
you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked at one but anyways we</font>

255

258
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,339
