115
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,630
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so many different little</font>

116
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,240
intricate parts that you have to take

117
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,910
care of in order to move and it stinks

118
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,010
why do we do this so often why do we do

119
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,230
this to ourselves I don't know it's

120
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:07,090
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like we're like our</font>

121
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:09,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">families growing and we need more space</font>

122
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,400
whose idea was that it's uh yeah moving

123
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,010
is never fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll it snap i think the</font>

124
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">most enjoyable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move will be when we</font>

125
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,990
decide where we're gonna actually stay

126
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,360
for a while like we decide to buy a

127
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,640
house that will actually be stressful

128
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">too but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit I</font>

129
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,070
don't know more rewarding i guess but

130
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,600
now we're super excited to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this</font>

131
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,010
new place i think i'm mainly stressed

132
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,820
out because i care about other people's

133
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,850
feelings especially those i love the

134
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,150
most like Jenna<font color="#E5E5E5"> Noah and I'm pretty much</font>

135
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:51,070
fully responsible for this move and

136
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,490
making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jen stays safe Penelope</font>

137
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,210
stays safe and healthy stops a nova and

138
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,040
also noah you know my mom's told me

139
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,850
stories about people moving and kids

140
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,569
it scares<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so yeah I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

141
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure everyone's safe and healthy</font>

142
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,190
and so it kind of stresses me out

143
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,319
slightly but it's good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

144
00:10:16,319 --> 00:10:19,110
acknowledge that it would be probably

145
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,819
abnormal if I wasn't stressed out right

146
00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:23,850
now sorry just said to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get through the</font>

147
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,000
traffic circle oh yeah anyways kind of

148
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,680
stressed out but I feel good I feel like

149
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,380
we're making the right decision Noah so

150
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,079
far probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels totally off because</font>

151
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,050
we're moving I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really</font>

152
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,009
anticipated how much that would affect

153
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:40,709
him but it definitely is he's kind of

154
00:10:40,709 --> 00:10:43,769
senses something's going on so it's good

155
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,019
though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was about to say soon we'll</font>

156
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,009
just be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to relax that's so far from</font>

157
