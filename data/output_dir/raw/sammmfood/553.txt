before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably already know this</font>

91
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,640
but if you eat at crown burger and spend

92
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,020
like 10 bucks you can park for free

93
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,350
which is basically a crime us to do so

94
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to park for free so Sam</font>
