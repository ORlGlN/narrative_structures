posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Facebook in this little sports</font>

46
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,739
group we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that we just talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever and here it is I don't ask you</font>

48
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,140
guys the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> question okay beautiful if</font>

49
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,050
someone offered you the opportunity to

50
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,220
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten half-court shots you make one</font>

51
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,099
of them you get 10 million dollars if

52
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,200
you don't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> any you go to prison</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,269
five years would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take the</font>

54
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,430
opportunity can you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I hit a</font>

55
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,340
half-court shot one and five he's you

56
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,459
took five shots oh ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would take the</font>

57
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,900
tip I think I'd make it one out of five

58
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,510
general would you take it I can't risk

59
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,970
that for having a child gosh see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,190
one I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like of course I would do it</font>

61
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,769
of course I would do it because I I'm

62
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,349
gonna do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this without I'm gonna do this</font>

63
00:03:00,349 --> 00:03:03,410
without like the repercussions but I've

64
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,180
definitely made I think I can make in

65
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,609
five like for sure technique for sure 10

66
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:11,150
but then if i missed final being without

67
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,620
these peeps for five years my family I

68
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,970
don't know what do you guys think would

69
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,680
you do it do you think you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

70
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,170
would you take the 10 shots and go

71
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Milt are 10 million dollars overage</font>

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,880

73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested after further debate talking</font>

74
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,170
and also looking at Twitter I've decided

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,330
that really wouldn't be worth the risk

76
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,430
even though I'd make the shot because I

77
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,680
think I'd be a little of myself cause in

78
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,050
prison for five years while these<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>
