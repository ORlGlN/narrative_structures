23
00:01:28,679 --> 00:01:30,090
that I just didn't know it until he was

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a bath and it wasn't as bad as the</font>

25
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:34,319

00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,840
allergic because he didn't swell up or

37
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,509

40
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,160
times cuz he took<font color="#E5E5E5"> forever to fall asleep</font>

41
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,500
last night too so I for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure thought he</font>

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,000
would sleep in any way at the point I

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,560
went in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only a couple hours</font>

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,330
later and his things were completely

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,190
just they were gone like it was just

46
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,560
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tiny red dot and so that was</font>

47
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,510
pretty comforting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm glad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he heals</font>

48
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,700
