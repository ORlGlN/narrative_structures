if you do see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other ones yeah in a</font>

161
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,889
way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the actors were great loved</font>

162
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,259
Finn and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the girl I don't know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

163
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,849
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give any spoilers with right fit</font>

164
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:27,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I spoiler though no we'll</font>

166
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:31,849
to save I know some of you guys are

167
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:34,940
waiting to see this I don't want to

168
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,190
spoil anything I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Sam</font>

169
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,559
wondering when the last video had come

170
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,830
out then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's been 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

171
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,360
years does assume he's been that long

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bell oh yeah actually having UTA well</font>

173
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,190
actually hasn't been two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> since I</font>

174
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,370
saw the red faced one that was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1999</font>

175
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">no I mean I actually really enjoyed it i</font>

176
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,589
SAT there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was entertained hey I</font>

177
00:08:57,589 --> 00:08:59,180
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was fast paced I was like</font>

178
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,730
this is some fun movie but there was

179
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,430
nothing super innovative to me and I

180
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,350
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there's a lot more does it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

181
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,200
desired right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't mean like they</font>

182
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,779
set up the movie nice for the future

183
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:12,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i know there's two more movies</font>

184
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,520
coming out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's more of the story</font>

185
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,190
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

186
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,709
don't feel like they developed fully<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

187
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:24,560
think part of my problem is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

188
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,820
watch a ton of movies i watch like

189
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,100
really good TV shows and with TV shows

190
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,650
they have hours and hours of character

191
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,630
development and so you really get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

192
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,730
know the story and then when you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

193
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,050
see a movie it's just like bing bang

194
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:42,770
bang bang but there's just still I can't

195
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:44,480
go too in depth on things we'll talk

196
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">more about this I don't know what there</font>

197
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,050
was only you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it first being</font>

198
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,420
like wow you know like you thought was

199
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,860
very predictable right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was super</font>

200
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,480
predictable but it was good<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

201
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,910
acting was great the action was great<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

202
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">I was very like parallel with every</font>

203
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,800
other movie which people probably love

204
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,870
right but I was looking for a little bit

205
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,170
more

206
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,120
innovation to me the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to</font>

207
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,769
describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it star wars the force awakens</font>

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,079

211
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:16,519
average consumer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i love the</font>

212
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,839
iphone it's super innovative but there's

213
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a little bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than I want it</font>

214
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,190
overall go see the movie yeah i would
