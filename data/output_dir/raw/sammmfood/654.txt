10
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,730
or two in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning I don't even know</font>

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,000
what time and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like falling from</font>

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,650
the couch so I was like saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

that no isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a screaming for no reason</font>

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,759

20
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:20,910
worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worse it drives me a little</font>

36
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,330
get nose ears checked out just to like

37
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,400
rule it out if he<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an ear</font>

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,590

44
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,440
we feel responsible to make sure our

45
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,620
child is checked and looked at right

46
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,680
just to rule something out I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,910
maybe you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you did have any</font>

48
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,080
infection that could be why he's

49
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,820
screaming like he was trying to unplug

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,590
his ears or something but he hasn't been

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,930
