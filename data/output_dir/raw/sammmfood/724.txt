49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">this now we can decide which photos to</font>

50
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,420
use now is the time to hang everything

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,220
up which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the hardest time for</font>

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,780
me because I never know how it should go

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,640
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked jen and she's like I don't</font>

54
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,840
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you should go this way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

55
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,340
then I'm like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

56
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,660
should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we usually</font>

57
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,640
don't get things straight and then we

58
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,440
end up just not hanging up anything at

59
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,830
all so but we are going to do this right

60
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,319

62
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,099
filler things that we feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

63
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:12,580
match the pictures and everything why

64
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,630
