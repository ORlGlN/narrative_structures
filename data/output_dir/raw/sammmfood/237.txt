like a reservation like a down payment

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,410
on the reservation the second time was

40
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,650
the IRS leaving a message on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my phone</font>

41
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,060
and then I picked up one time and they

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,430
said I still owed my text all right to

43
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,040
pay my taxes still which wasn't true and

44
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,580
then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third is today I can't really</font>

45
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,470

is as a factory warranty on my car had

52
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,610
expired and that they had special

53
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,440
