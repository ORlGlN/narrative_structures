a week and I'm up there always changing

243
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,330
I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot weighing on me the</font>

244
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,400
past couple days and I don't really know

245
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,110
how to

246
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,209
talk about it the correct words to use

247
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:54,440
or just anything basically gender like

248
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,010
free agents right now and we have the

249
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,720
freedom where we technically could live

250
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,310
wherever you guys are like oh you just

251
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:03,800

252
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the time being but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're really</font>

253
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about where we want to</font>

254
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,560
be long term if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move to a</font>

255
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,790
different state I almost feel like our

256
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,860
time and Utah's up I feel like it's time

257
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,560
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> move on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to something new we've been</font>

258
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,720
in Utah a long time I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've lived</font>

259
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,089
in the state now for seven or eight

260
00:13:20,089 --> 00:13:22,100
years which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

261
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,870
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're ready to move closer</font>

262
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,370
to family I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is yet</font>

263
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:27,320
I've always thought it'd be cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live</font>

264
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,060
in New York or Chicago suburbs I think

265
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,100
Texas is cool Arizona there's just tons

266
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,360
of different places but Jen<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I are</font>

267
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,240
gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really start thinking</font>

268
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,779
about this praying about it pondering

269
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,040
really thinking about what's best for

270
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,410
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> family going forward and our kids</font>

271
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:48,019
because you know we've definitely

272
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:49,820
established some roots here needs on

273
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,449
it's been great but I feel like soon

274
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:55,670
it's like time to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> new it's</font>

275
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,230
just kind of like the feeling I get and

276
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:59,410
usually I go with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feelings I get and</font>

277
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:02,890
see the fruit of it it's it's good so I

278
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:06,410
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know kind of in a weird place</font>

279
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,920
right now so I don't want to say like

280
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the things I've done the past year</font>
