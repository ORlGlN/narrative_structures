00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
hey guys recently Noah has been waking

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">up at night crying and then eventually</font>

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,430
goes back to sleep so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were wondering</font>

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,010
if it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> many night terrors but then we</font>

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,120
discovered that night<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrors don't</font>

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,040
start until like age too but some of you

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
may actually be dealing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,880
of your kids might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have night terrors or</font>

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,890
they have had night terrors in the past

10
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,260
it's a pretty common thing we discovered

11
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,910
I love technology and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,340
product that was made cavalli as the

13
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,800
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> proven solution to night terrors</font>

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,480
what you do is you stick it underneath

15
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,519
your kids bed it actually sends out

16
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,410
vibrations and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps regulate</font>

17
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,329
their sleep patterns so that then they

18
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:35,640
eventually after about four weeks to

19
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,380
learn your sleep pattern you don't even

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,210
need any more right so it like vibrates

21
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,129
right before they're about to have a bad

22
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,960
dream so it kind of wakes them up and

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">like they don't even have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dream</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

24
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you don't even have to worry about</font>

25
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,649
it so I know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of parents</font>

26
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:48,480
