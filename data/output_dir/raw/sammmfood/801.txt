better than we played tonight and we

198

still lost this is about to go to double

199
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,200
OT hoping this bring some luck and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

200
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,570
mango is delicious going to triple

201
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,390
overtime it's been a crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> game the</font>

202
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,580
goaltender's have been phenomenal the

203
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,500
longer this goes the board nervous I get

204
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,450
this is a big game for the series I mean

205
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,890
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the hawks lose they could win</font>

206
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,930
the next two at home but I think it

207
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:46,920
carries a ton of momentum triple

208
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,410
overtime the longest game in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Black Hawks</font>

209
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">history oh wow that's a good one to win</font>

210
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,480
honestly that indeed flip of the coin

211
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,450
either team had so many chances triple

212
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,840
overtime almost two full games and that

213
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,100
