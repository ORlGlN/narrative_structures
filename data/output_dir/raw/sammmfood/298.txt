258
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:08,559
got back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the post office and I had</font>

259
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:09,910
a bunch of packages I saw and it was

260
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,470
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of crowded for this late at night</font>

261
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,170
and it's a self-checkout Kiev thing and

262
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,439
you type in most of the address on some

263
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:18,939
of the packages that you do because they

264
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:20,410
like verify that it's a deliverable

265
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,990
dress etc whatever

266
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,420
and for two of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in my head I</font>

267
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,730
thought I'd typed it out maybe I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

268
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,110
don't think i actually did though I

269
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,060
thought I'd typed out the address and

270
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,430
name and I just jumped to conclusions in

271
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,830
my head put<font color="#E5E5E5"> two packages in without</font>

272
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,130
actually putting that dress on it so in

273
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:40,050
the drop box right now there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

274
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,670
packages now sitting there think a sec I

275
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,020
should put another package in there

276
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,420
that's because it boxes extra ones that

277
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:51,089
says like help but mill and the post
