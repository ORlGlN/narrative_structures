104
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:45,020
computer right now but i'll actually put

105
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,490
them in the video so you can look at

106
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,220
them up close so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had you guys decide</font>

107
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,740
between two designs here's design one

108
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,700
and then here's design to one of them is

109
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,460
accented with different sports balls and

110
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,600
things like that which i think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

111
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,950
of fun and then there's one that just

112
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:03,800
kind of you know plain and normal since

113
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,210
i posted those pictures there's actually

114
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,220
a third option now which includes balls

115
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,060
and airplanes oh wow plus we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

116
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,620
mix it up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> different colors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we</font>

117
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,300
can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on like darker shirts this</font>

118
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,889
would most likely be on a white shirt<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

119
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:17,780
here's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fourth option which we</font>

120
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,510
could put on a darker article of

121
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,610
clothing this is the true for this is

122
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,950
actually a different face

123
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,350
