00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,150
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do is pray for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

152
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,639

153
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,669
don't say you by name sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

154
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:57,110
will leave a<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment a tweet or</font>

155
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,669
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will pray for</font>

156
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:00,710
you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I enjoy doing</font>

157
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:02,810
it's something just praying at night

158
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,040
with Janis it's something that's brought

159
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,810
our relationship together we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a</font>

160
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,190
night without saying a prayer together

161
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,970
it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for us to kind of talk</font>

162
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,919
just gotta regroup at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

163
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,150
and think of others and like I said we

164
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,040
all have different beliefs and I'm not

165
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,050
saying mine are right or yours are wrong

166
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,669
but if prayer is something that you

167
00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:24,080
believe in say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> prayer for Colin and</font>
