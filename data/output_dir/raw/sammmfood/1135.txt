definitely more pressure on the guys

122
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,419
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jenica says that she doesn't need</font>

123
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything if I was doing anything for her</font>

124
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,380
I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say anyways because she's</font>

127
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,620
you do do something I'm

128
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,110
to kill you<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that's the Valentine's</font>

129
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,080
Day spirit do you guys do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything for</font>

130
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,490
