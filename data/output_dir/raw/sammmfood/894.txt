00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons why I gained so much weight get</font>

00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:49,959
like 10 to 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds working here</font>

36
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,950

instructure i nst are you si tu r e

40
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,870
located here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Utah in structure has a</font>

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,540
product called canvas if you're in

42
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,820
college or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even maybe in K through 12</font>

43
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,310
school I guess I covers just about

44
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,800
everything you may have used something

45
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,350
online a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people are familiar with</font>

46
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,000
blackboard that's like the number one

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,940
competitor but we have canvas which is

48
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,070
obviously the cooler learning management

49
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,560
system so yeah what it does is actually

50
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,540
I mean all you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> were like oh yeah</font>

51
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,510
I've used canvas I don't like canvas or

52
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,520
I like canvas or I hate blackboard you

53
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,710
had blackboard stinks but what it is is

54
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,090
basically when you register her class

55
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,680
like for me when I was a huge<font color="#E5E5E5"> on state</font>

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,510
and I took a college course i would also

57
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:56,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">be enrolled in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that on canvas that's</font>

58
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,530
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we returned in our homework</font>

59
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,120
sometimes we would have quizzes the

60
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,070
syllabus is posted there so it's a way

61
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have your classroom online and yeah</font>

62
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,190
that's where I worked I didn't work at

63
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">an Adobe I didn't work at oh it's</font>

64
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,270
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else people would say a</font>

65
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,930
parking garage<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't CIA I'm trying</font>

66
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think of the other places where you</font>

67
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,500

69
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:22,280

70
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">a really good job it was fun basically</font>

71
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,450
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did was make sure that everything</font>

72
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,460
was running while I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like coding</font>

73
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,810
or anything like that when problems

74
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">would arise I would go into the rescue</font>

75
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,940
the work itself was you know it was

76
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,790
rather mundane the day-to-day work what

77
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,310
I would do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the atmosphere is what</font>

78
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,960
made it really fun and cool the people I

79
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,880
worked with really sweet I enjoyed

80
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,070
everyone there just celebrate like every

81
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,110
single sorts of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

82
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,490
celebrate it was just kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what</font>

83
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,050
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do as a person as well and</font>

84
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,880
like you saw in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past North nerve</font>
