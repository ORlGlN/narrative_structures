Easter when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stuff that we should</font>

35
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:07,729
recognize every day of our lives if it's

36
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,530
something we truly believe and love<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,079
love gin she's the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing woman in</font>

41
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,519
years which has flown by I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

42
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,500
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> for her like every week when</font>

43
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,690
we were in college I didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

44
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,489
her flowers that much because number one

45
00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:30,500
she<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wasn't like a big fan of them</font>

46
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,140
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> said and two we just didn't have the</font>

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,579
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend on it and we'd rather get</font>

48
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,280
like fun snacks instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen works so</font>

49
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,230
hard for our family she's such an

50
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,900
amazing mother such an amazing wife that

51
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,160
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> special for her</font>

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,660
every week I don't know if it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

53
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,609
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing every single week most</font>

54
00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:48,920
importantly I want Jen to always feel

55
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,959
loved based on how I treat her our

56
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,209
actions our time spent together our

57
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,269
conversations but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a reminder is</font>

58
00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:00,739
good to something like flowers so I just

59
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:02,060
went and picked these up what I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

60
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,889
to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of get her flowers every</font>

61
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:05,269
single Saturday for the rest of our

62
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:07,489
lives and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him there maybe it</font>

63
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:08,660
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there when she wakes up in the</font>

64
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,400
morning or I was thinking I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> man</font>

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,599
when we're out of town they'll be kind

66
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,040
of rough but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want that reminder</font>

67
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,450
and then those flowers can stay there

68
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,799
throughout the week just buying someone

69
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:17,150
flowers doesn't tell them you love them

70
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,639
but it's it's definitely a reminder so

71
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:21,019
starting today I'm starting a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

72
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:25,239

00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,479
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me while generals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to clean up the house get laundry done i</font>

115
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,039
also finally was able to mount the TV

116
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:08,410
this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second TV that we have</font>

117
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,020
mounted in let's see two days and

118
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,930
mounting a TV really isn't fun at all we

119
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,669
mounted one at<font color="#CCCCCC"> tylers yesterday and then</font>

120
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:18,400
we got one up at our<font color="#E5E5E5"> place today the</font>

121
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,789
funny part<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say it's funny</font>

122
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,590
frustrating part is we had everything we

123
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,620
felt centered all ready to go like an

124
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:29,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two later</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we hang the TV up we</font>

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,349
step<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and it</font>

126
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,620
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely slanter than crooked so</font>

127
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:37,270
it took<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a while to get that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed but</font>

128
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,160
we finally got it going now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just need</font>

129
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide the wires and I think it will</font>

130
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">look a lot nicer Jenna's kind of wanted</font>

131
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,500
to mount the TV for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so it's</font>

132
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,660
out of Noah's reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also realized how</font>

133
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,699
grateful I am that Noah has a friend

134
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:51,039
next door to play with because in the

135
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,930
area<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we live in there's a ton of</font>

136
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,970
college kids that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving in and like</font>

137
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:58,240
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the space which I'm totally</font>

138
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,889
cool with it doesn't bother me at all it

139
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:01,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just nice that no I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone that</font>

140
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">lives so close that he can play with we</font>

141
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:05,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't live super close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any of his</font>

142
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,880
cousins so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool that he has friends</font>

143
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,470
that he can play with I feel like that's

144
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,169
super important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for kids to have</font>

145
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:12,400
interaction with other kids and then

146
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,229
they kind of learned how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be nice how</font>

147
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,750
to share how to not hit I feel like a

148
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months ago Noah's little rougher</font>

149
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,680
around other kids but he's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten</font>

150
