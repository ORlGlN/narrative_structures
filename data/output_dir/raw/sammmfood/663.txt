134
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,110
just like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a good situation I</font>

135
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,360

137
00:07:10,749 --> 00:07:14,360
comfortable recliner I went there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

138
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,619
looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and it didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font>

143
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:26,079
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to address the situation</font>

144

right now

145
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:30,419
I look at a couple other places and

146
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,879
recliners are pretty expensive so this

147
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,949
was an awesome deal at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sams club I'm</font>

148
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:37,469
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping it helps at least us get a</font>

149
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:39,329
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more rest I know that's kind</font>

150
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,819
of selfish but if there's anything we

151
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:43,379
can do to improve the situation might as

152
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,869
well do it right these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

153
00:07:45,869 --> 00:07:49,169
