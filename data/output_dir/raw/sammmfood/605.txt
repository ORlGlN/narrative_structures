keep asking me how we hung up our

81
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,660
christmas lights inside the house this

82
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:25,260
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i used right here see these</font>

83
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,270
commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> strip just these little hooks</font>

84
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,400
put them up on the wall they're not

85
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,900
supposed to cause damage although i

86
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,510
think they often take the paint off

87
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,280
depending on how cheap your paint is

88
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,410
this place is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cheapest paint</font>

89
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,970
ever and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like with the</font>

90
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,080
temperature of the wall it kind of

91
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,790
affects it differently but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what</font>

92
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,020
we use we just put them up on the wall

93
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,340
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then hug them that way didn't have</font>

94
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,230
to use nails or anything it was super

95
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,180
easy totally recommended they're kind of

96
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,360
expensive i feel like this box alone was

97
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,180
like six or seven dollars which i think

98
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,670
is way too expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that so we have</font>

99
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,560
a new place to get things<font color="#E5E5E5"> done to get</font>

100
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">work done I think for now this will be</font>

101
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,760
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like my new little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work place</font>

102
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,760
just right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in the kitchen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this area</font>

103
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,910
was definitely designed to have like a

104
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:13,169
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I'm just a place to work</font>

105
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:15,270
so I cleaned it up and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

106
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,770
enjoying it especially because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jen was</font>

107
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,060
like watching a show tonight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was</font>

108
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">in here I can usually do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with my</font>

109
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">laptop and things but when I want an</font>

110
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,180
extra monitor or just a bigger viewing

111
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,669
space I usually I'm upstairs like in my

112
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:29,490
office and I'm kind of far away so you

113
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,810
know that's good sometimes like when I

114
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,610
need to get away and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really focus</font>

115
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,620
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am digging this setup</font>

116
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lindsey my sister if you are watching</font>

117
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:38,639

118
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,399
family pictures from Thanksgiving right

119
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,289
now I'm guessing you probably want to

120
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:45,110
use some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those for Christmas card no</font>

121
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,639
for a moment we had forgotten about them

122
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:50,250
so i'm editing him right now you can't

123
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,100
really tell like the colors like all

124
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,230
funny from this camera but they look

125
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:58,290
really nice you might use this as like a

126
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,000
Christmas cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to give it</font>

127
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,620
away if anyone you know is watching this

128
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,230
but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cute Jen got some really</font>

129
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,630
good shots of Abe too I can't wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

130
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,459
send you so I'll probably have these

131
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,050
done soon and then I'll email him over

132
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,300
to you I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> play ball tonight I am</font>

133
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,940
so out of shape I need to be working<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

134
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,790

00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,790
survivor and I should be asleep too

138
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,649
