want so bad and they're usually really

29
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,659
hard to get and that's why they're your

30
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,340
grills because you have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just</font>

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,290
that they're released and I've never

37
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">been able to get them and I would never</font>

38
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,670
pay resale value because that's just

39
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,890
like insane but

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,640

whole leg in that shoe yeah yeah yeah so

45
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,120
anyways if I had a grill for shoes it's

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,460
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it on just like one shoe if</font>

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,790
out for some shoes but some plans fell

57
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,650
through actually to have anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

58

60
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">was not to go to Salt Lake and probably</font>

61
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,530
isn't that safe always to do it by

62
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,670
yourself some people get a little

63
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">anxious even here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in logan sometimes</font>

64
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,300
people get a little on edge when it

65
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,040
comes to sneakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of you guys might</font>

66

are you thinking yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like oh man</font>

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,230

drive out to salt lake tonight there's a

70
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,590

Nike told him just to keep wearing him

109
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,350
so he did and the brand grew from there
