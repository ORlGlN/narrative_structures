138
00:10:46,529 --> 00:10:47,970
normally just find another house

143
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,779

144
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,180
and I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking so that's fun I</font>

148
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,149
think it's Millennials versus Gen X so

149
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:14,399
far I'm kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of biased but I actually</font>

150
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,319
like the Millennials I know whatever i

151
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really like anyone at first but no</font>

154
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">takes a couple episodes to really figure</font>
