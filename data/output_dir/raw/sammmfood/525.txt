181
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,339
up less than five minutes showering so

182
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,589
getting them wet I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous and she's</font>

183
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:42,060
like no you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not in the first</font>

184
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,950
24 hours you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them wet but then</font>

185
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,560
like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to like just live</font>

186
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,970
life how you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to live life</font>

187
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:49,110
like they're gonna fall out when they

188
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,180
fall out no matter what your lashes are

189
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,680
gonna fall out no matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> what cuz they</font>

190
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,529
have a cycle as well um honestly what

191
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen these come out very rarely</font>

192
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,279
have they been attached to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my actual</font>

193
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,920
eyelash only a few have that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font>

194
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,079
actually seen have had my eyelashes on

195
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,730
them so it's like I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been</font>

196
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,200
worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that she says it's good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

197
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,209
get them wet to make sure they're clean

198
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you don't want like build up</font>

199
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,270
like dirt<font color="#CCCCCC"> buildup and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff because</font>

200
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,610
that's like really bad this I is

201
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,020
shedding faster than this is shedding

202
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,100
which is only thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> bothers me</font>

203
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,160
because I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's a little OCD</font>

204
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,750
I've been like I want them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall out</font>

205
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:28,800
evenly but it's not a big deal I think

206
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,020
they're worth it I love it they save me

207
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,890
