153
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:48,430
now but to me obviously the person in

154
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,759
the White House affects a lot that

155
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,580
happens in the world but I continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

156
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this way I'm happier this way is</font>

157
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,350
that we control what happens in our

158
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,240
house right we can control so many

159
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,250
different out oh yeah and the little

160
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like there's so many things that</font>

161
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:06,910
we can still control I've never using

162
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,039
them in the White House<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I just</font>

163
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,800
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good parent is I feel like</font>

164
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,990
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> US citizens were behaving it would</font>

165
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,820
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the world better anyway you</font>

166
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,120
know like I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like whoever becomes</font>

167
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,289
president people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to blame</font>

168
00:07:23,289 --> 00:07:25,509
their actions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that project when it's</font>

169
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:27,970

be strangers but we're connecting right

184
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,310
over having a moment together I think

185
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's why I like going to midnight</font>

186
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,139

219
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,139
good job I say this because I've

220
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,180

two people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who should vote for this and</font>

225
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,560
that it's like my thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not that</font>

226
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,269
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not about telling people who to</font>

227
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:35,490
vote for it's about just being<font color="#CCCCCC"> closeted</font>

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in life and and doing the little</font>

00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,900
being taken the wrong way because I've

277
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,040
avoided talking about politics

278
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,840
altogether because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like I'm</font>

279
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,250
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the position to always talk about it</font>
