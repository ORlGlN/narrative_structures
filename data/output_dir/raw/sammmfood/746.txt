00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,190
a long way to go but dude<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's meant I</font>

69
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,350
so much of this is mental like staying

70
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,110
with the team mentally numbing is

71
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,560
usually down there I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna say</font>
