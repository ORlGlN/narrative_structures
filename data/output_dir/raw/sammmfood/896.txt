173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,409
sometimes it's good to keep certain

174
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,150
things private I think even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though I</font>

175
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,309
felt sick and I've kind of been out of

for people in fact we're gonna have to

255
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,640
cut down<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all the different things</font>

256
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,160
that we do to make things<font color="#CCCCCC"> work I</font>

270
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,800
the fact that we can can do more

271
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,630
photography and art things this isn't

272
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,060
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing YouTube this is chasing</font>

273
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,130
both of our dream things that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

274
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,350
passionate about so I hope that we're

275
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,079
not misinterpreted with our intentions

276
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,850
or anything like that I actually have my

277
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,470
eye on some part-time work that I would

278
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,510
love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do if I could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it 15 to 20</font>

279
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,370
hours a week that would even free things

280
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,709
up enough I like working I like doing it

281
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,750

don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is all coming out and</font>

283
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,540
making sense that's part of the reason

284
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,459
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have on top of our</font>
