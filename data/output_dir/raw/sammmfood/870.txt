here so we're packing and our room is an

64
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,700
absolute mess it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a hoarders</font>

65
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,530
room right now so we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

66
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,120
get this done as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

67
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,550

to pack not a lot tomorrow's gonna be a

69
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,660
busy day I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it quickly</font>

70
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:26,170
we're becoming experienced home movers

71
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,300
packers hardest part is just getting

72
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,430
started I think my least favorite part

73
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,050
is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the paperwork of like</font>

74
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,060
moving into a new place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just all</font>

75
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,400
that stuff and changing utilities and I

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,470
blablablabla it's not even that big of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

77
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,460
deal but that's my least favorite part

78
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,710
Jenny hates the packing part now I have

79
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,170
to pack two people our family just keeps

80
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,340
getting bigger and bigger we just grow

81
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,930
out of our places and now that we have

82
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,120
Noah I can't even believe we thought

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">about having a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one-bedroom apartment or</font>

84
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,570
initially like when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into</font>

85
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,650
here we're like maybe we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font>

86
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,870
one bedroom whew dodged a bullet there

87
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,660
that would have been terrible I'd have

88
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,370
been terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> he would still be eating</font>

89
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,020
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the night yeah you would have I</font>

90
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,040
don't know how we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that</font>

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,710
you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done it it just stuck</font>

92
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">him in the hall we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have had to</font>

93
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,790
figure something out this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very</font>

94
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,590

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,750
downstairs we won't wake them up

100
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,040
sometimes I get a little bit crazy
