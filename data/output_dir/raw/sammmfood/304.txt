69
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,460
trying to really have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

75
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,400
getting more sleep then I was making

76

79
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,990
talking about how I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was feeling to Sam</font>

80
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,970
or whoever if I was having a bad day and

81
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,710
and Sam was really great and checking in

82
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:39,740
on me like how you doing you know um so

83
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,660
that that was really good I can't think

84
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things right now for some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason feel</font>

85
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,390
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little foggy today but that's alright</font>

86
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:49,459
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're a lot more allowed to</font>

not really sure or maybe you'll just

92
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice in the videos I think another</font>

93
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,370
thing that's really helpful is getting

94
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,410
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the house if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dealing with</font>

95
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,040
PPD or any type of foggy day there's

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,959
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you something you have a foggy</font>

97
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,959
day without it being PPD you know I mean

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,519
so I wouldn't say I have PPD anymore I

99
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I'm over that hump I just get</font>

100
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,510
foggy days that's how we'll say it um

101
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,460
but getting a house is really helpful

102
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,160
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like going working out in the</font>

103

molds because their side hair doesn't

163
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,340
grow as fast as the back of their hair

164
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,230
so because it's supposed to all go out

165
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,360
together yeah and it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't grow</font>
