102
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,480
the vlog but when Tyler and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Haley</font>

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,160
here I spoke a lot of Spanish just

104
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,390
joking around because they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

105
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,100
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny and they were like how did you</font>

106
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,570
learn Spanish like how long did it take

guys already speak a foreign language

110
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,910
one thing that helped me was to just

111
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,070
take this little Spanish dictionary and

112
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,680
learn like five to ten words every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day I</font>

113
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
would usually learn them while sitting

114
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
on the toilet and I actually dropped

115
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,210
this in the toilet it was it was clean

116
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,650
