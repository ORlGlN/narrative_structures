boss potty<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss Oh for those of you that</font>

31
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:54,189
don't know Utah's a very dry place and

32
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:55,450
then all places get dry in the winter

33
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,520
plus when we have our heater on in our

34
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,439
small apartment it makes it super dry

35
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,539
and it's hard for your body from what i

36
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,880
read your sinuses<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually fully heal</font>

37
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,740
because the dry air and everything just

38
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,590
slows everything down so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i decided to</font>

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,410
get another humidifier if he has been

40
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,330

48
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,849

162
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,540
were never in the position to have one

163
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,490
being at school and work nice i'm

164
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,230

165
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,380
smaller apartments we will continue I

166
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,089
mean there will be moments / of course

167
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,070
they'll be frustrating<font color="#E5E5E5"> yo absolutely</font>

168
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a baby's fresh paint isn't</font>

169
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,580
absolutely someone compared it like it

170
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,690
well if you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have a baby</font>

174
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,060
lovers like that since I've had dogs and

175
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,780
I've had a baby and one was a lot more

176
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,900
painful to get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're telling me</font>

177
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,360
what no I was talking my dad today and

178
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,200
he's like it's like having another

179
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
family member of the family which is

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely true so puppy update you're</font>

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,170
greatest<font color="#E5E5E5"> prayer for Noah and for our</font>

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,770
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research on the side we</font>

193
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,090
just don't include you guys on it cuz

00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,690
read articles about Liam<font color="#CCCCCC"> assuming the</font>

197
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,730
puppy is an email I'm emailing we've

198
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,110
been youtubing we've been reading

199
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,450
articles<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to train like all these</font>

200
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,070
different things about different dogs

201
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,260
and came to conclusion that the shaming

202
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,360
is probably not the best fit probably

203
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,280
not right now oh he's renowned he's

204
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,470
super cute but we do have a dog couple

205
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,060
dogs that we're really interested in and

206
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,980
someone's gonna text us photos tomorrow

207
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,040
of them because they're not ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,650
to a home but they will within the next

209
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:21,340
week week or so so we'll see how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

210
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,840
and then they're close enough that we

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,670
can also bring Noah and buy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just</font>

212
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,100
see like how that would even<font color="#E5E5E5"> go yeah</font>

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,170
lots of them where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shamini was for</font>
