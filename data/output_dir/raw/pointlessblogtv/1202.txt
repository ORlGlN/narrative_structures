it's been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question and today's</font>

5
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,580

11
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:20,720
incredible but then I thought

12
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,279
transforming would be even better

13
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:24,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you could almost be invisible by</font>

14
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:26,060
turning it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into something ordinary</font>

15
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:27,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">people wouldn't notice that you're their</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into a bat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I would be</font>
