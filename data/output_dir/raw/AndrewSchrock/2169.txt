52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,440
cursing left and right but who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

53
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,959
first person to like to say a curse word

54
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then to think it was bad you know</font>

55
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:14,290
like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> did that conversation go hey</font>

56
