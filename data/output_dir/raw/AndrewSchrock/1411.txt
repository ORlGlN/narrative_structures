49
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,479
I'm actually doing this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because</font>

60
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,520

that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we released in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the video and</font>

63
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,869

64
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:50,909
a fun video I haven't produced a

full-length skate video in seven years

66
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,700
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably my favorite one</font>

67
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,110
I've ever done that's the honest truth

68
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,229
it will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available on DVD and digital</font>

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,060
download the digital download doesn't

70
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,710
look like a problem itunes is kind of

71
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,450
seeming annoying so hopefully itunes

72
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,040
will be up and ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the release</font>

73
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,140

78
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,520
digital downloads should be as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

79
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,980
a DVD you get extra content you get like

80
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,100
seven or eight minutes extra extra<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonus</font>

81

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,550
something so many things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

104
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,840
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> warehouse is happening to we</font>

105

00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,640
sign for the warehouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

108
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,080
waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> further where else to be</font>

115
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,970
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fact eyes okay like if you</font>

116
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,410
if your teacher asks you about being

117
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">factored you're like I've already been</font>

118
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,250
factored in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm probably pretty good at</font>

119
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,660
cod class like I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be taught</font>

120
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,010
anything I've been factored already now

121
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,840
inside the revived world<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be</font>

I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Star Wars maybe so I was</font>

195
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,190
thinking if I made a big deal here on

196
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,720
the internet and I got asked for a bunch

197
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,340
of people's help to hype me up like if I

198
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,470
got the filmmakers attention like JJ

199
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,790
Abrams and all those people that work

200
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,590
with him if I got their<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention it</font>

201
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,820
might be a cool thing with her like all

202
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,900
right we're gonna throw this due to bone

203
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,370
and let him be in Star Wars I can just

204
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,540
walk in the background looking all

205
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,830
creepy or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm doing that would</font>

206
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a dream come true like literally a</font>

207

208
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,090

209
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,410
with my skateboard company and all that

210
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,030
but if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Star Wars like a piece</font>

211
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,800
like my child would it come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

212
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,570
past my childhood self is a better way

213
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to where that would come out of the past</font>

220
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,410
people like me think logically and

221
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,330
realistically and I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could make</font>

myself look like an idiot on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

227
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet enough people might pay</font>
