to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep me in the face how could that go</font>

37
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,600
wrong right well the way that could go

38
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,849
wrong is that I checked all<font color="#E5E5E5"> my gear to</font>

39
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,200
start you know everything was<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,660
good and I guess my microphone died like

41
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,580
right when I began filming and I got

42
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,560
nothing I got a bunch of video with no

43
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,840
