46
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,390
a little bit if that's even a way to

47
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:53,080
talk it it got me<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking and i'm going</font>

48
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the guys together and go</font>

49
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,500
out to do a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> snow skate video where</font>

50
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,090
we go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> street spots and do real tricks</font>

51
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,890
rather than goof around in wes's

52
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,130
backyard but what you saw in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one in</font>

53
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,180
this video was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time I'd ever</font>

54
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,000
strapped into a real snowboard I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,100
used cheap like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Walmart snowboards back</font>

56
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,060
when I was younger and that is

57
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,340
completely different so that was like

58
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,620
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I'd ever attempted to</font>

59
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,660

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,010
