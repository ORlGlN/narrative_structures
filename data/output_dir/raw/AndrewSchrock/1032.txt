we've actually planning it for a long

156
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,350

162
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,280
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll have videos talking about it</font>

164
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,910
the lookout and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also we just restocked</font>

165
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:57,770
on like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our decks so if you need</font>

166
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,150
a deck right now we pretty much have

167
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,310
every existing graphic right now in

168
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,140
stock especially the liftgate<font color="#CCCCCC"> died</font>

169
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,290
unlimited series deck whatever that is

170
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,550
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that always goes fast but now</font>

171
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,050
we're like fully stocked on them so if

172
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want that deck it's there along with</font>

173
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,290
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a heads up because</font>

174
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,850
I didn't do a video saying hey we

175
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,710
restocked but we did totally restocked

176
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,960
and with force things are a little weird

177
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,430
we actually changed our urethane

178
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,560
provider which caused a huge hiccup in

179
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,660
production it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> formula</font>

180
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,690
it's like a really hard 99 durometer

181
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">street wheel and they skate great and is</font>

182
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the paint on the wheel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

183
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,580
people care about graphics on wheels so

184
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,200
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they always inevitably get</font>

185
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,850
messed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the wheel is the wooden</font>

186
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,620
wheel is the paint stays on these wheels

187
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,060
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better this time so I'm really</font>

188
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,190
psyched about that but yeah they're
