1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,920
so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dallas Ford's smashing his</font>

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,449
face upon the<font color="#E5E5E5"> floor of the skate park</font>

3
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:19,890
and I didn't ask him<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I could safely</font>

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,689
say that it did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not feel good because</font>

5
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,789
I've kind of done it before I think am I

6
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:25,470
and have you ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed that usually</font>

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,939
when someone hits their faces while

8
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,830
skating and no one typically sees it

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,480
coming like the skaters like oh man<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,580
I got this the filmers like finally he's

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,290
gonna land it even you guys watching it

12
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,030
like okay this do it has this trick and

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,710
then boom smashes face upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground</font>

14
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:43,410
and everyone's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> God is he coming you</font>

15
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,579
know because it just happens like a

16
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,110
flash of<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin lightning in Mario Kart</font>

17
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,700
and you could use that reaction if you

18
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,050
want to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's called I'm screaming</font>

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a microphone face that's effective</font>

20
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,469
it's pretty effective people will know

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,300
that you're shocked really Dallas was no

22
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,350
exception here I didn't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

23
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,789
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was gonna go down the way it did</font>

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> response he did skate for the</font>

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,940
rest of the session but he kind of laid

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,199
