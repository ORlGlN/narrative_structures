world and just film like the life as a

25
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,170
skateboarder across the world and I

26
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,079
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an amazing idea so they</font>

27
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,340
have a trailer for this thread their

28
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,780
entry to the contest<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a trailer for</font>

29
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,199
the idea of this and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you guys to</font>

that is the very least you can do ok I

37
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,610
think skateboarders are like brothers

38
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,479
you know if you're a girl you're a

39
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,700
sister<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever we're a big family need</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to say</font>

41
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:23,939
growing up you know you'd see another

42
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,770
skateboarder at least for me at see how

43
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,330
the skateboarder be like oh you're one

44
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,530

45
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,210
and I've always had that opinion it's

46
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,500
kind of funny because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the</font>

47
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,390
trailer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cory duffel pet says the same</font>

48
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:35,130
