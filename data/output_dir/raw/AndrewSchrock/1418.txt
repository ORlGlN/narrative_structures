skateboard taking this hoodie off and

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,980
luckily Alex was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay like you know he</font>

17
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,180
walked away and he kept trying the trick

18

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go well all right</font>

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,890
well maybe we just need to sit down a

20
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,960
rethink our lives but the important part

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">is did you hear the smack of that board</font>

22

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> his head yeah i mean that's like that</font>

23
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:06,930

24
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,119
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean there have been countless</font>

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,220
times where the board like flies up and

26
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,119
I'm like it's gonna hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> me in the face</font>

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,580
but it never has it like it never ever

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,320
has and then Alex was like you know he's

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board's flying up he's gonna be the</font>
