9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:21,539
of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to revisit it and just kind of</font>

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,070
fill you in on the story when i first

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">started skating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handrails were where</font>

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,250
it's at like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I watched</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero videos i</font>

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,630
watched or mystery video just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to skate handrails on and the</font>

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,470
street I grew up<font color="#CCCCCC"> on was beechmont Avenue</font>

16
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,308
and this is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

17
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,440
handrail on it there's a lot there's

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,969
some dinky ones here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there but like</font>

19
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,140
none that you can actually get on the

20
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,210
slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there was this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rail and it's a</font>

21
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,890
13 stair and we call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slides of</font>

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,149
faith because we just thought we would

23
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">never be good enough to skate it well I</font>

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,260
got good enough to skated and I skated

25
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,420
it finally and the first few goes that

26
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,730
this thing was a disaster watch these

27
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:56,250
Falls see so I took some tumbles and

28
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,989
those might have looked bad and I mean

29
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">honestly they probably were bad but I'm</font>

30
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,989
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of durable or at least I used to be</font>

31
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,670
and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> got up and kept skating it</font>

32
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,769
and I landed<font color="#CCCCCC"> my front board I totally</font>

33
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,220
landed

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,090
and then I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that I want to</font>

35
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">do all my other tricks on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so I want</font>

36
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,820
to do a 50-50 and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a</font>

37
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,290
switchboard slot and want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a lip</font>

38
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:19,060
slide and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably would have</font>

39
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,770
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy I don't know I skated rails a</font>

40
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,940
lot back then so i probably could have

41
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">done those but the 50-50 didn't really</font>

42
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,040
go so well now that would hurt I'll be

43
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,540
I'll be honest okay and like my face is

44
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,250
actually flying on the concrete and I

45
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,140
just like get my hand right in between

46
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,910
the way instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like smacking my face</font>

47
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,770
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ground I smacked my face onto my</font>

48
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:37,120
hand which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the grounds and I was</font>

49
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,350
freaked out I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like because I've</font>

50
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">never had a really an issue on 50 50 s</font>

59
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,070

60
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,420
just look at the camera be like oh that

61
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,420

62
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">being sarcastic I it did hurt but I</font>

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,350
didn't like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know sit there on the</font>

64
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,180
ground in a ball like oh I can't skate I

65
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,890
actually got up and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skate I</font>

66
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,690
rolled<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to a bunch of times and I was</font>

67
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">just kind of shaken up so I didn't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

68
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,750
and unfortunately I didn't get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

69
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,220
back and land it because soon after a

70
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,050
car hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rail and just took it out</font>

71
