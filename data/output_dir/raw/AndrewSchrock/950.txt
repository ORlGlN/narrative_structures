74
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,820
voices

screaming it was right in my ear so that

84
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,130
was a little bit much but yeah I mean

85
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,180
think about what you're teaching these

86
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,620
kids k people there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> such thing as</font>

87
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,090
inside out for its side voices just

88
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,190
don't scream unless it's appropriate

89
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,390
because there are times there are good

90
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,170
times to scream<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one time Dewey from</font>

91
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,790
scream<font color="#CCCCCC"> david arquette cut me off a golf</font>

cart I didn't scream but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

93
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,760
appropriate time to do so and that's

94
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that's a true story it was a fact</font>

199
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">was like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years old when Jurassic</font>

200
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,050
Park one came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I'm not gonna break</font>

202
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,410
self but either way I saw but it's kind

203
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,640
of funny then like the wind Jurassic

204
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,630
world comes out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see that five times</font>

205
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,520
it was so good you need to see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

206
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next movie come out is ant-man which</font>

207
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,610

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,960
not i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if i'm gonna care to go</font>

209
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,400
see in the movie theaters<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly and</font>

210
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,010
the reason the fact that i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

211
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,470
might not be like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> great is it means</font>

212
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,850
it's probably gonna be amazing but i

213
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,320
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i'll wait till see that how</font>

214
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,670
the reviews come in and i might go see

215
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:05,960
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's kind of a weird it's</font>

216
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely a weirder one when it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font>

218
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,400
good I mean you know that he gets hungry

219
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,900
and goes to chipotle I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've judged</font>

220
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,400
the caliber of a person is by their

221
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,900
hunger for chipotle so I'm open-minded

222
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,970

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,500

football like one of the spiral ones and

268
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,810

269
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,400
face but don't laugh cuz i know that

270
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,660
