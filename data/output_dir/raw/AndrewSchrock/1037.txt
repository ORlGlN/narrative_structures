1
00:00:10,849 --> 00:00:13,860
all right fine there you go that was

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,269
Jacob Romero and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that he</font>

3
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a nice guy okay he's just an honest</font>

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,529
strapping young lad does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean he's</font>

5
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:21,750
hot mess he's strapping no okay yeah

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,220
he's a strapping young lad he didn't

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:24,750
deserve that cuz I was kind of a violent

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,460
fall like he was okay he<font color="#CCCCCC"> got up and you</font>

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,109
know he went on with his day he drank

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,609
smoothies played ninja turtle do games

11
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,289
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we all do but he</font>

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:32,880
really didn't deserve to get like yanked

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,290
back to the ground like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because the</font>

14
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,450
fall didn't really make sense defied the

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,250
laws of<font color="#E5E5E5"> physics lake in my eyeballs I</font>

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,450
see it and I'm like it doesn't make

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense I guess foot came off the board</font>

18
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,570
and he should have just fallen onto the

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,160
quarter pipe but instead like an

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,780
imaginary<font color="#E5E5E5"> fisherman</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he yanked him back</font>

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,850
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom of the ditch see just</font>

22
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,890
like that that that kind of explains it

23
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,090
like when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see that footage I'm like</font>

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,860
okay that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably what actually</font>

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,329
happened I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just didn't see it he was</font>

26
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:58,680
creeping the woods I don't know what he

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,820
was doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there wasn't though there</font>

28
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,770
was a fisherman somewhere and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> freakin</font>

29
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,660
hooked<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto Jacobs front feeble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one was</font>

30
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,790
like nope but that being<font color="#CCCCCC"> said it is you</font>

31
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:07,770
know I do watch it I'm like he fell in a

32
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,970
small apartment because I'm human like

33
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,799
see people fall unless it's like

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,630
disturbing or they actually got hurt but

35
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,950
he didn't get hurt<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got hurt but</font>

36
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,210
he didn't get hurt so I'm cool with this

37
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,790
I can't help but edit in a few screams

38
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,680
to make this clip even better okay

39
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,810
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> he fell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out a far distance the</font>

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,130
bottom of ditch so I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>
