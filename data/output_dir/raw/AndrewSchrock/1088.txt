1
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:17,650
get a blanket Sam vessel count some

2
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:19,029
sheep order some pizza because you're

3
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,650
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sleep I'm kidding Sam don't</font>

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,789
actually go to sleep at all because as

5
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,039
far as face hits go that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

6
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,660
best case scenarios kind of smash your

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:26,710
face in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is never gonna be</font>

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,150
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't go home that day and</font>

9
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,289
when your mom asked you how you were

10
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:30,939
doing you weren't like you know what I

11
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,560
smash my face in the ground it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was okay</font>

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,600
no it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good day good day to be me</font>

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,250
that didn't happen but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did kind of</font>

14
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,140
smash it into a pillow of grass all

15
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,219
right now would take a pillow<font color="#E5E5E5"> of grass</font>

16
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,020
over concrete and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much any day of</font>

17
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,489
the week especially comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a falling and</font>

18
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:44,649
then plus Sam had a beanie and hoodie

19
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:46,390
and I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that some of that</font>

20
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,519
material protected his face from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

21
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:50,440
brutal blades of grass that<font color="#CCCCCC"> laid beneath</font>

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,000
him just like to think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,379
other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his face yeah that's</font>

24
00:00:53,379 --> 00:00:54,219
straight up hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dirt and that</font>

25
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:57,129
probably sucked but hey it's still not

26
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:58,839
concrete best-case scenario which is

27
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:00,190
weird to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way like I smashed</font>

28
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,929
my face but hey it could be worse

29
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,070
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're rolling up to a</font>

30
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,390
handrail that big that's like the last

31
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you want to do is all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

32
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">g√ºlen is just whatever happens not to</font>

33
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,000
have my face hit the ground that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,250
Sam<font color="#E5E5E5"> vestal did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but it was the</font>

35
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">best-case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenarios being the worst case</font>

36
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,570
scenario that makes sense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

37
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,640
because it makes sense I would like to

38
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,260
point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this might be the most</font>

39
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,030
peaceful looking handrail ever but all

40
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,410
the green around<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just think that</font>

41
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's feel like birds chirping while</font>

42
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,020
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this and he's gonna land it</font>

43
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:29,280
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking birds are chirping</font>

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,799
but no<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes real fast</font>

45
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,830
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it kind of</font>

46
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,330
sucks to be Sam vessel because he's used

47
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,560
to landing tricks like he gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,210
handrail and he's usually front feeling

49
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,470
down it and roll it away and he's like

50
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,330
yeah my name's my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> V man that's</font>

51
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,920

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,150
said it was you probably know this

53
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,500

54
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,180
yes invested was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right he lived</font>

55
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,370

<font color="#E5E5E5">got two were late for a Mario no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz the</font>

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,970
thing would've landed the trick<font color="#CCCCCC"> but he</font>

58
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,920
did he<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't live but as always I'm</font>
