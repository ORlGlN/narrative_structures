1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,900
oh you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right and that is what you're</font>

2
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,250
afraid of when you're trying to handrail

3
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,720
all right well honestly I guess getting

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,279
sacked is the number one fear but that

5
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,779
is a close second because when your feet

6
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:24,990
go flew over the obstacle you're falling

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,730
on your in fort in that moment when Sam

8
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,410
realizes that what's happening is like

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,030
this this next five seconds my life is

10
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,230
not going to be fun whatsoever now

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:39,840
luckily Sam got his foot down in time to

12
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like relieve some of the impact</font>

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,040
and not completely eat it but he still

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,360
hit pretty hard I mean you hear those

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,770
thuds there's a lot of thudding going on

16
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of want someone to take this</font>

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:53,039
thuds and make a song out of it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,930
rap song with thuds but I do just want

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,760

24
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,250
