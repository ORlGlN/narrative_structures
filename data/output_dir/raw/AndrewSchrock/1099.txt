because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ryan Bracken goes from standing</font>

22

00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,899
watch the whole cliff momentum kind of

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:00:59,340

a great conversation after he fell and

31
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,280
Ryan Bracken had some great comments to

32
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,270
make I got it I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hey all right</font>

33
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,950
however this thing it's like cheese

34
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,200
grater like the fat size is greater so

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,820

reminisce on is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is the type of</font>

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,990
fall that like it takes you a while to
