you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a small deer packed</font>

15
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,990
whenever a doctor gives you information

16
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,730
they always get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this face like 1i goes</font>

17
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,500
kind of like this like you even if it's

25 tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> but what I'm trying to say</font>

31
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:57,930
is that it sucks being off my skateboard

32
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,789
and i'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> now cutting the tiptoe my</font>

way back on it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i cannot wait to</font>

34
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:03,059
freaking get back into the swing of

35
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,409
things because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need to be me and you</font>

36

38
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,840
like what so<font color="#CCCCCC"> my time off my skateboard</font>

42
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,470
busy dude<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you look at all the</font>

00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,119
frigerator you see magnets didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

44
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">can-do what I'm talking about but it's</font>

45
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,460
funny because I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of feel like a</font>

46
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,720
businessman you know like I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wake up</font>

47
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,159
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't skateboard and I just do</font>

48
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,990
work for my company or my channel or

49
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,430
whatnot and it's like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we wear okay</font>

I have fun at least like I do have fun

51
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,310
at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's like I guess</font>

52
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,450
there's just a thing about skateboard

53
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,380
that makes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel a little younger</font>

54
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,270
yeah they say camera adds a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> pounds</font>

55
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,409
while skateboarding takes a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

56
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:37,320
off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I recently went to California</font>

57
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,450
for a weekend and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I it was awesome</font>

58
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,500
because we were filming promotional

60
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,979

61
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,540

62
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,040

152
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,010
little i mean i like it like I'm all my

153
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,320
friends are hating it and

154
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,670
it's so easy to hate things you notice

155
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,900
is like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be that dude that</font>

156
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't like that okay i don't like that</font>

157
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this voice and I'm elegant and I</font>

158
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,690
do not like things but if you seen the

159
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,950
new trailer their personalities are

160
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,850
there and that's what I've said before

161
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,050
that's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm worried about</font>

162
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,480
but megan fox like she ends the trailer

163
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,300
with a little bit of cheese and I'm not

164
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,620
you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> died</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that did</font>

165
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,670
it happens I see her<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm just gonna</font>

166
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,160
win about it so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's gonna</font>

167
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,570
be kind of hard to get through the movie

168
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,150
if she's super cheesy but um like I said

169
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,370
open minded I don't hate it yet it's

170
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,960
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I don't hate it their</font>

171
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">faces the faces could be better i will</font>

172
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,200
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the noses are kind of creepy</font>

173
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,820
