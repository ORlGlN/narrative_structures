1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:13,410
call myself alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys so there are</font>

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,670
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from this</font>

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:16,650
clip immediately from watching it the

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,940
first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Thomas is a liar</font>

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay he said he caught himself call</font>

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,279
myself you do not catch yourself Thomas

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,330
you hit the ledge the stair the

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,500
grounding to skateboard all at the same

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,150
time k catching yourself is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">last thing you did in the second thing</font>

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,119
we learn from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> clip is that he has</font>

12
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:32,098
no pain in his legs or ankles or feet to

13
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kayla cuz like I said he hit the ground</font>

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,370
the ledge the stair and the skateboard

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,719
maybe this is how he deals those paint

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,610
like he like slams new just jumps up and

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,050
tells a lie to feel better<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,489
situation like he smashed his head you

19
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:42,510
just jump something else I<font color="#E5E5E5"> got more the</font>

20
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,920
lottery no you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do not you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not win</font>

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lottery Thomas okay you fell well</font>

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,230
it's just accept this fact no but

23
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,940
seriously I'm sure Thomas had a reason

24
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,340
why he said that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know I</font>

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,750
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see a way that he would</font>

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,340
have fallen harder than that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

27
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe his face was fonder the</font>

28
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:58,980
cement he kind of caught himself from

29
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,390
the ground hitting him in the face I

30
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,460
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know cuz i was filming I just</font>

31
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,400
wasn't really in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> face or shoes or</font>

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,420
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't I wasn't him at the</font>

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">time but if it is one thing I've learned</font>

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,750
from watching Thomas kate is that he can

35
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,189
take a fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him</font>

36
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:12,659
wounded I mean I've seen him do some

37
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,939
really weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> falls okay and he just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

38
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bounces up like I think he's like</font>

39
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,340
bodies made of rubber<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something cuz</font>

40
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,650
just bounces up as a gum<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I know</font>

41
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not I just so you jump down an</font>

42
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,770
aid steer onda primo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then turn your</font>

43
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">ankle the same time but he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just jumps up</font>

44
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,890
and keeps going most the time like he's

45
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,509
one durable dude just sayin<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas has a</font>

46
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,400
body that doesn't really break I believe
