getting punched by Iron Man okay and

40
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,729

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,549
punched by Iron Man at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:41,180
hitting it on the handrail

away keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> eating the weeds take a second</font>

48
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,950
and imagine like a kid that wants to

49
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,510
start a skateboarding just driving by

50
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing this at the same time like oh</font>

51
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,410
look mama skateboarder the family<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,210
anymore Timmy sorry that sucks I

55
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,620
remember one time when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kid I saw</font>

56
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,330
a guy I'll curtain blew my mind if I

57
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have seen Chris hit his face on</font>

58
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> handrail it's still probably to blow</font>

59
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,090
my mind look at this freaking farmers

60
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,830
tan what are you talking about Andy

61
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,420
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong with a skate spot this rail</font>

62
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,850
I mean it's a low you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a low</font>

63
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,590
and risky because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on their low</font>

64
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,910
and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could fall down real big</font>

65
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,100
and so it wants to be bored slate or

66
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,990
front boarded want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just look at you</font>

67
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,520
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to skate this rail but then</font>

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,200
you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it not the best</font>

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,970
roll up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if you mess up like</font>

70
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,350
Chris did you're gonna you're gonna go

71
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,240
down and honestly most people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

72
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,010
just probably sacked or something but

73
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:39,310
