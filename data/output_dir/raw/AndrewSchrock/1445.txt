1
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,740
so what you just saw was clearly amazing

2
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,000
skateboard y'all even need to tell you

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,990
that because when you're watching it

4
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,280
you're like oh this guy's heart from

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,240
your double set that I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

6
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,310
jump across this guy is doing a rail

7
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,350
longer than my house this skating speaks

8
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,940
for itself as what I'm saying and also

9
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,680
the videography was amazing like you

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,570
just your eyeballs all around liked what

11
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,070
they saw and the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

12
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,110
is that this wasn't from a youtube video

13
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,970
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> skating is from an actual skate</font>

14
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,650
video does anyone remember what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

16
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,900
of a skate video like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these exist still</font>

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,210
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really scary to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me to think</font>

18
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the world is kind of going to where</font>

19
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,570
everyone just watches skate videos

20
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,919
online like granted like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

21
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,260

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,290

28
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:24,150
skate videos that you put into whatever

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,280

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:36,630
door and going to skate but I'm just

36
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,650
