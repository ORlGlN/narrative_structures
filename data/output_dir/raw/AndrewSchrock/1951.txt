12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,610
have children<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatnot but it's it's</font>

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:38,610
happening now and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's it's</font>

14
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,100
so unreal in fact I think I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,600
I've never done<font color="#CCCCCC"> this yet I'm gonna shout</font>

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,890
it to the world you guys can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be here for</font>

17
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first time I am going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a dad</font>

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,079

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,539
listening in fact they flew<font color="#E5E5E5"> south</font>

20
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:56,399
literally no one heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you guys</font>

21

were here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so uh I don't know but</font>

22
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:01,920
on a different note it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,969
unfortunate though because a lot of

24
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,530
times when people find out their friends

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">are having children or you know or</font>

26
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,939
whatever doing the family thing they're

27
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh I'm sorry like that sucks like</font>

28
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,900
that's ridiculous like I think every

29
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,280
parent once they actually hold their

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,619
child in their hands like oh this is why

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,680
I've been here and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm like</font>

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,150
I have nothing but good feelings<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>
