00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,849
so then there was some mix ups with

112
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:22,379
emails and finally I think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

113
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything and hopefully they put a rush</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to like rock their product you</font>

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,870
against it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go play xbox all you want</font>

126
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,760
but uh I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was kind of</font>

127
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,830
weird that goes one they<font color="#E5E5E5"> went from xbox</font>

130
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,530
name I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care but the fact</font>

131
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,790
that you can't play<font color="#CCCCCC"> it without the</font>

132
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,739
internet kind of like putting me a light

133
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,349
bulb out at d light bulb in my head if

134
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:02,549
you may I was like that does not make

135
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:04,349
sense at all you know with technology

136
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,519
things r opposed to get better and

137
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,019
easier right but like I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like lately</font>

138
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:08,400
the new video game systems I've been

139
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,049
like wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> what like everything should be</font>

140
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:11,310
backwards compatible I should be able to

141
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,230
play a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Playstation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one game on my ps4</font>

142
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,930
and you know vice person with xbox and

143
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,029
nintendo at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> nintendo you can play</font>

144
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,410
wii games on the wii u that's kind of

145
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,029
cool but still a gamecube that should go

146
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:21,980
in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

147
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,270
connection thing is like it just sucks

148
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,290
like what if you're moving into a new

149
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,850
place like I can't play video games

150
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,840
because don't have the internet for two

151
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,310
