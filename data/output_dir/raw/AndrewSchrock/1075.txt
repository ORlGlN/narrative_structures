magnitude in that fall but the sad thing

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:33,550
about this fall is that people walking

<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's definitely a fall that</font>

33
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,260
Johnny felt for the next few days it's

34
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,670
just not enjoyable and then forget

35
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,110
shoppers didn't even care so there's no

36
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,580
good positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in fact that it got</font>

37

caught on film also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to point out</font>

39
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,440
the Johnnies friend is speaking French

40
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,720
probably because he is French but it

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like a golf announcer he's</font>

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
speaking so delicate that I just can't

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">help but think he's commentating softly</font>
