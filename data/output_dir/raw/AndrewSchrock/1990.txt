00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,419
everyone but I just want to state some

127
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:39,680
of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> really stood out to</font>

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,870
me in the videos one guy had his friend

129
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:43,669
make revenge fingerboards it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> printed</font>

130
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:44,870
right on there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything looks so</font>

131
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,330
legit I was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed by that I'm</font>

132
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:49,699
actually going to contact him to try to

133
00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:50,960
buy one from him hopefully I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

134
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,539
another guy did he did a parody on the

135
00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:55,250
bling when I to song dammits and he

136
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,210
played the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guitar and everything and</font>

137
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,800
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> he filled in the lyrics with you</font>

138
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,449
know except<font color="#E5E5E5"> about revenge and whatnot it</font>

139
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:00,710
was really funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was laughing at that</font>

140
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,370
and then probably the one video that

141
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,990
stood out the most to me that did not

142
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,770
place was a younger<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy named Alex I do</font>

143
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,750
believe he made he started<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on a</font>

144
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,600
website for me he actually bought the

145
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,120
domain we are revenge calm and it just

146
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,050
he showed so much so much you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

147
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,150
and motivation and intuition is that out

148
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the whatever really really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ambitious</font>
