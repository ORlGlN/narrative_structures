00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,950
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the metro to war a day or two</font>

4
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,020
ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was i was pretty stumped I was</font>

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,760
like man I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a video to post in</font>

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:39,379
the middle of week what am I gonna do

7
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,239
and then it hit me like a punch to the

8
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:42,860
pancreas I was like oh I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

9
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,660
skate video and I've done a video like

10
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,280
this before four tricks for scanners

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,330
video so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the first</font>

00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,890
one they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link at the end of the</font>

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">video but you know since I did this one</font>

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,059
I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I should just kind of</font>

15
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,100
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a reoccurring video so if</font>

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,570
you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the idea of this once you</font>

17
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,979

18
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,239
you know I'll do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other stuff</font>

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,610
like I usually do so that stuff's not

20
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,839
going anywhere but you know in addition

21
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,489
like just do these videos once<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while</font>

22
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:05,869
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it give me a thumbs up if</font>

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,310
