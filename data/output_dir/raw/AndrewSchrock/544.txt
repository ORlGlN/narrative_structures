3
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,600
and funny and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fall was not one</font>

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,099
of those Falls if in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you watch</font>

5
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,480
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes you do this okay maybe put your</font>

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
fist and for your mouth and say ooh like

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,510
I did I don't know why that's a thing

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,650
you know let's think about that way

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,420
who's the first person to go oh and then

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,680
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else saw that is like you know</font>

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,090
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> next time I'm shocked I'm gonna do</font>

12
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,380
the same thing let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep that</font>

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,790
going for all the time but either way

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,350
that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those Falls okay in fact</font>

15
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the wrong way that you</font>

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:42,989
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall you don't want to fall this</font>

17
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:43,980
way basically what I'm saying is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,450
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the wrong way to skateboard you</font>

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,100
know how a teacher in class somehow says

20
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,690
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the improper way of doing</font>

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,649
it okay if they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> teaching a class</font>

22
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,969
called skateboarding they would hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

23
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:52,770
this clip by the way guys this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

24
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,280
wrong way just skateboarded any

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,989
questions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam Gershwin and he</font>

26
00:00:57,989 --> 00:00:59,039
knows how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the right way of</font>

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">skateboarding I've seen him land tricks</font>

28
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,000
okay I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> him just roll away for a</font>

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,739
kickflip in fact I've actually never

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,090
seen it rollin kickin<font color="#E5E5E5"> what seen him do</font>

31
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,650
an ollie laser flip though okay that was

32
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,090
cool I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> drink some hot sauce we</font>

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,360
go oh oh almost like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tackle my mouth</font>

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,590
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was not the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best idea but he knows</font>

35
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,670
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it the right way in the wrong</font>

36
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,740
way so he is ambidextrous okay when it

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,320
comes to skateboarding he's in pajamas

38
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,310
skateboard all right that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what he is I</font>

39
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,540
think the worst thing about these Falls

40
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,070
though because like I've never don't

41
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,509
want this bad but that was pretty pretty

42
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,100
bad but when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like feed go over</font>

43
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,750
your falling backwards back down to

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,509
earth it's that it goes so slow and you

45
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,159
have that moment where you're like oh my

46
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,979
gosh I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> about to fall so hard whatever</font>

47
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:38,880
your hands are doing your hands

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,200
basically could have been handcuffed

49
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">this way because you're not gonna help</font>

50
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright if they do you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just gonna</font>

51
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,640
like break a wrist or something it's

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,439
awful and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that moment you have so</font>

53
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,060
much time to realize you're helpless and

54
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,110
you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> falling down to earth but</font>

55
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything else in life that's good goes</font>

56
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,439
by so fast then when you watch Star Wars

57
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,430
the movie theater first time you just

58
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to end and then also boom</font>

59
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,180
it's over okay fins on the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise</font>

60
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,979
flying somewhere else to<font color="#CCCCCC"> meet old Luke</font>

61
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,619
Skywalker and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> over it sucks k tacos</font>

62
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,180
they go by way too fast that's how

63
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,950
that's a thing to date night with your

64
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,630
girlfriend for the first few times K

65
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,970
those go by way too fast and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

66
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,318
not with her anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then life sucks</font>

67
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,290
until the next

68
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,430
and then it's all right but this

69
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,170
skateboarding fall when your feet go

70
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,700
over that ledge time stops and you're

71
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,769
like yeah my life<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

72
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:19,989
horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm about to smash my back</font>

73
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,030
open on the ground or<font color="#E5E5E5"> my head hopefully</font>

74
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,469
it on my head but I have an hour to

75
00:02:23,469 --> 00:02:24,700
think about this while it happens while

76
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,019
my hands are a metaphor you a hand comes

77
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:27,760
in the air so why not and it hurts<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

78
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,319
i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure i didn't ask sam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

79
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,730
fall but i'm sure this<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of time</font>

80
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,290
it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a rude awakening in skateboard</font>

81
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,519
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have once a while you're getting</font>

82
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,140
thrown to the ground it wakes you rudely

83
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,370
it's kinda like when people yell at

84
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">teenagers they're like you have another</font>

85
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,310
thing coming to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> in life life is</font>

86
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,840
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit you hard this is what they</font>

87
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much the perfect</font>

88
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,819
clip to display<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hey Stu your rents</font>

89
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:50,769

90
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">Falls like these that make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me all those</font>

91
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,470
things skateboarding is like it's such a

92
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,060
dangerous thing in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few years</font>

93
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,310
exact I heard that skateboarding has the

94
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,260
least percentage of reported injuries

95
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,209
and percentage so that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that paper</font>

96
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:02,889
every hundred skateboarders compared to

97
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,510
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred football players like less</font>

98
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,620
reported injuries come from

99
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,209
skateboarding and then any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> sport</font>

100
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:09,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but then when</font>

101
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,900
they see<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gershwin do this to be like</font>

102
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,329
nah you're playing football<font color="#CCCCCC"> man put your</font>

103
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">helmet on but parents don't tell your</font>

104
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,319
kids what sports to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> or activities</font>

105
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">which ever whatever you want to do it</font>

106
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:19,959
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let them do their passion</font>

107
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:20,949

108
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:22,389
skateboarding skate<font color="#CCCCCC"> borings amazing and</font>

109
00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:24,280

110
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,049
