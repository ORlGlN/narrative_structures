14
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,960
missile my gosh it was like it had like

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,790
a vendetta if that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right word</font>

16
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,430
against his eyeballs or something but

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,170

18
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,879
