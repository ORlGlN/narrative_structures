what how where why when Carmen Sandiego

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,260
how did that happen is what I'm trying

7
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,120
to say here like he was lip sliding and

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,410
then he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> falling he was like you know</font>

9
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:54,540
at some point during that he was like I

10
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about a roll onto my head okay</font>

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly Eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kinslow understand</font>

00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,430
something that we don't and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

13
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,780
glad that he does because that was very

14
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,550
entertaining I mean literally he went

15
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,960
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> like lips led to break dancing like</font>

16
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,369
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and he pulled it off pretty suave</font>

17
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:07,050
like I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that i'd have liked</font>
