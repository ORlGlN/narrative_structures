18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,380
week's topic not to said we're topping

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,969
too much but is from NJ x jeff and he

20
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:43,950
says talk about if skating is really

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,170
worth it if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not all too good and</font>

22
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,239
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> other career choices in mind is it</font>

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,770
worth hurting yourself over in the end

24
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,600
what is the beauty of skateboarding to

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,449
you and you know what NJ<font color="#CCCCCC"> X Jeff that's</font>

26
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:55,860
that's a pretty decent question that's

27
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,930
why I picked it ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's easy ok it</font>

28
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,190
doesn't even have to do a skateboarding

29
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:01,440
really if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have a passion or</font>

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,809
love for anything then yes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

31
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,850
worth skating in this case if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

32
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to jump down 20 stair</font>

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,750
handrails to have fun skating so if you

34
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,729
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into a career where like your</font>

35
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">body is good if you you know you can't</font>

36
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,610
really do that career if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hate</font>

37
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,670
yourself skating then don't you know

38
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,380
don't skate huge stuff i mean i know

39
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,000
here and there you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to you know</font>

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,290
you might turn your ankle skateboarding

41
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,670
but you can turn your ankle walking you

42
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you're always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have run the</font>

43
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,820
risk no matter what you do of hurting

44
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,400
yourself so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't see that any</font>

45
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,890
any career you do like skating would get
