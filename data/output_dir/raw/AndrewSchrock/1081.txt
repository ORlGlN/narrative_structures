holidays and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm kind of got back into</font>

14
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:29,580
like the workflow ish I mean like<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:30,869
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little slower these days because</font>

16
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:32,850
after the holidays people just stay in

17
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,440
their house and do things like they

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,760
watched like state by the Bell reruns

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,290

20
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,149
sitting here at work and doing taxes

21
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:40,559

working on new taxes but home life is

23
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,829
different because once my wife is back
