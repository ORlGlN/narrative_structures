00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,939
pump out videos but um if I'd if there's

64
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:01,350
like a slow down on the videos it's

65
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,520
because I've got way too much stuff

66
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,280
going on I'm trying to like like make my

67
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,220
way into this new job but the good thing

68
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,520
is that with making that much more money

69
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,020
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be able to put money into</font>

stuff

71
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,769
revenge like you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

72
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">revenge t-shirts and we're actually</font>

73
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,340
about to redo revenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> altogether because</font>

74
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of people are just like losing</font>

75
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:22,510
interest in bailing out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the crew so</font>

76
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,769
we're like down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a skeleton crew right</font>

77
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:25,060

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,590
schedule some time to go film we want

79
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,720
revenge 10 but what I'm saying is that

80
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,040
like we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to revamp things</font>

81
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,360
maybe bring in some new people into

82
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,390
revenge um so revenge is not going away

83
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,370
at all but look for some changes to

84
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,650
