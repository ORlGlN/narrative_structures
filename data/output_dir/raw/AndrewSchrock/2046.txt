00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,370
orange barrier we were scanning and it

20
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,620
just tracked right in half like like it

21
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,080
blew apart so he filmed for the rest of

22
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,020
the session at that time and then add

23
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,780

29
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,280
crooked grind and then he actually

30
