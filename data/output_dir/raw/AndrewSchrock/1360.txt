1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:17,820
is that triple yeah there you go that

2
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,109
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> tragic right and when that</font>

3
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,939
happened I just felt in my heart and the

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,220
way I reacted completely captures how I

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:31,260
was worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alex no no you my</font>

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,840
friend just made a fall Friday<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh yeah</font>

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,540
seriously what like I mean honestly like

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,190
as much as I love Alex and I like this

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,480
trick like I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was cool and I</font>

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,910
was even<font color="#CCCCCC"> joya</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baloch but it was anyone</font>

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,350
surprised that that happened he was

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,510
rolling on an old school<font color="#E5E5E5"> board holding</font>

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,520
his board jumps off the old school board

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">does a triple flip with his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lord</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

15
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:51,840
lands on it except he didn't he landed

16
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,879
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> earth exploded into the concrete but</font>

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,410
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is that no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would ever be</font>

18
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,940
surprised that Alex ended up on the

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,280
ground very very fastly off of his

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,109
skateboard onto his body but luckily

21
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,550
this was just a light-hearted fun

22
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,170
falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and of course didn't get hurt</font>

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,970
but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did get hurt</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font>

24
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wouldn't have laughed at him</font>

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,000
and told him using me to fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday but</font>

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,320
even though he would have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a fall</font>

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Friday because that's just how it works</font>

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,810
when you fall in front of my camera and

29
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,520
if you watched we want revenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> for tea</font>

30
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,229
which came<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a couple weeks ago this</font>

31
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:18,030
trick was actually in there and yes he

32
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:26,189
did land it no it was not I'm sure a

33
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,780
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people had no idea that it was</font>

34
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,189
a triple flip though at<font color="#CCCCCC"> first he was</font>

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:30,299
trying double and I was like dude I

36
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:32,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's going triple and then he's</font>

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">like all right I'll just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of try to</font>

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,470
fling it faster and then he ended up

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,860
doing it

40
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,040
but it was not smooth at all it was

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,690
really sloppy grants it was triple flip

42
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,980
I know you can be sloppy on a triple

43
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,870
flip<font color="#E5E5E5"> people still like you but I'm</font>

44
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,210
