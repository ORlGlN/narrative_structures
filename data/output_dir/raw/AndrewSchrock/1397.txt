34
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,809
like a bunch of blood and stuff and

35
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:05,430
everyone's like Andy go to the hospital

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,720
like no I'm not gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to hospital</font>

37
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,189

38
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,110
better if my legs starts to like feel

39
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,850
