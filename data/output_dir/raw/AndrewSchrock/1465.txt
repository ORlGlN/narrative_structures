why I suck at transition ninety percent

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,370
of the time when I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trick on a</font>

6
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,900
quarter pipe or something like my feet

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,189
just fly over the top and I go

8
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,110
face-first into the quarter like Daniel
