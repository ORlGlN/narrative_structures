23

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,850
pro skater you want a name so I added my

30
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,820
personality to videos you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

31
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,319
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of skating I would like just have</font>

32
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,700
some goof around stuff and at the end of

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the videos no matter what it was I</font>

34
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,380
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a little talking part and I</font>

35
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,119
still do that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect</font>

36
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,580
my face with the content the video so

37
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,810
it's like oh that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dude you know</font>

38
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,509
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked out real well for me I do</font>

39
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,610
get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people saying hey let's talk</font>

40
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,650
more skating on my skate videos but you

41
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,640
know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get people that</font>

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,680
that say crap to you on YouTube<font color="#E5E5E5"> but uh</font>

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">um for the most part I get ninety-eight</font>

44
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,979
percent amazing feedback on my style of

45
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,509
videos so i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this really done a lot</font>

46
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,189
for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i would not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere near</font>

47
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,470
where i am on youtube without adding my

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,390
personality to my skate videos so

49
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,650
whatever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do if it's skate</font>

50
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:43,399
videos or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know like music videos</font>

51
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:46,020
skits just make sure you put your own

52
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,720
touch to it make it yours okay if you're

53
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,070
gonna do the same thing someone else is

54
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it they're not gonna have any</font>

55
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,310
reason to to subscribe to your channel

56
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,720
if they can just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the person that</font>

57
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,579
did it first which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably better</font>

58
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:57,780
get out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> here if you're gonna go and</font>

59
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,450
copy someone but uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know have your</font>

60
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,310
own ideas and put your own touch on it

61
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,869
whether it's just talking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the camera</font>

62
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:06,149
I just personality to it or you know

63
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:07,560
blowing people's mind with an<font color="#CCCCCC"> original</font>

64
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,348
idea whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it yours</font>

65
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright my second tip is to reply to</font>

66
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,680
your comments

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,409

68
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,700
your comments it helps you stay

69
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,689
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people that are watching</font>

70
00:02:18,689 --> 00:02:20,099
your videos you know you make a personal

71
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,500
connection and that's great but also if

72
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,670
you have a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people conversing on</font>

73
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,349
your video it boosts your video into the

74
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:26,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">most discussed category whether it's</font>

75
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:30,060
sports or comedy or animals you know but

76
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,170
if you have a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to</font>

77
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,790
any video it might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the 50th most</font>

78
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,639
discussed video of that day which is

79
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,930
great you know it increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chances</font>

80
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,579
of someone just<font color="#E5E5E5"> randomly stumbling upon</font>

81
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,049
your video<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you might just gained</font>

82
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:44,219
another loyal watcher also be nice no

00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,269
matter what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if someone's being</font>

84
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,220
rude with you don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't give them</font>

85
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time of day don't rub them the wrong</font>

86
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,510
way because other people might see that

87
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,010
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a jerk and it just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

88
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:54,569
just going to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> people off so make</font>

89
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:56,730
sure you're polite and nice and don't be

90
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:59,579
a jerk in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in life in</font>

91
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,659

103
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,629

128
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,919
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sub for sub because a lot of</font>

129
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:15,209
people ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that's</font>

130
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,259
ridiculous it just dilute<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube a</font>

131
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,310
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's doing sub for sub is going</font>

132
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,180
to have so many people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

133
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,510
subscription boxes that not your videos

134
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,060
come up it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the mid</font>

135
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,440
love a stack this big and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's just</font>

136
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,780
ridiculous so sub for sub is a bad idea

137
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,730
but you know reminding people to

138
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,950
subscribe is never a bad idea so go with

139
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but that's it i hope i hope that</font>

140
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,230
helps um you know really it's important

141
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,020
just to make creative videos that stand

142
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,400
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the most important thing</font>

143
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,380
because you can do all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those all those</font>

144
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,030
things all day but if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

145
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,430
some decent videos that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have made</font>

146
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,139
your own to back it up it's not going to

147
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:53,150
matter and if you have a lot of

148
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,100
subscribers and nobody cares about your

149
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,360
videos that's not going to matter so

150
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,889
make sure you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing like all the</font>

151
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,440
pieces have the good videos and you know

152
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,350
