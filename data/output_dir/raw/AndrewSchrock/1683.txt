00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
warning my face is about to look really

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,950
stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bartol jump fight or dog is gonna</font>

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:13,710
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah just suck is it my hair oh this</font>

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,660
is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> update video that was hands down</font>

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,190
like the creepiest thing that's ever

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,420
been in one of my videos and if you're

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,130
still watching this I applaud<font color="#E5E5E5"> you begin</font>

8
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,449
that was just kind of downright

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,760
disturbing apparently I'm in a really

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,830
goofy weird mood today but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

11
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">update video where I talk about my life</font>

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,039
and such and you either listen or don't

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
listen or actually there's no other

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,700
option or I think that's it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,110
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure I completely do me to myself</font>

16
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">when a couple update videos ago I said</font>

17
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,469
my life was relaxing and I had time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

18
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:39,450
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that just went</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight</font>

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,070
out the door like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just skating</font>

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,719
and filming which is taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of my</font>

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,129
time it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff</font>

22
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,480
and try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready for the wedding and</font>

29
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:56,129

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,790
pneus if that's a word it is a word I

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,950
got an overwhelming amount of positive

69
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,800
feedback and reaction to this like

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,680
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really psyched on it and</font>

71
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,780
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know just made me feel</font>

00:02:18,109 --> 00:02:20,599
idiot you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a naked juggler or</font>

75
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,189
something weird like that and I'm really

76
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,659
hyped to get the promo videos going for

77
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:25,129
a vibe but don't expect to get your mind

78
00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:26,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">blown by them because I'm basically just</font>

79
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:28,760
making these with older footage but for

80
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">revived to kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like so it keeps the</font>

81
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:32,510
momentum going up until we actually

82
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,370
release product and product will happen

83
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,900
at the beginning of June and just a

84
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,849
warning we're not gonna have a lot of

85
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:39,739
product in stock at first because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had</font>

86
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:41,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pay like thousands of dollars just to</font>

87
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:43,609
get the trademark and I'll work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

88
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:44,720
the lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatnot so we didn't have</font>

89
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,220
as much money to like relaunch the

90
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,290
company as we would have liked so if you

91
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,329
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> revive product the beginning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

92
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:53,120
get it as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can because there</font>

93
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,650
will be like a little funk like we're

94
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,939
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell out pretty fast we're only</font>

95
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,950
get like 150 decks in and then we'll

96
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,209
have shirts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stickers and then</font>

97
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,219
they'll probably a little period of time

98
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,750
or like we're out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a couple weeks but</font>

99
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,889
it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be long and then after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

100
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:04,939
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the normal swing of things</font>

101
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,590
where we have stock in at all times just

102
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,599
a warning though it is going to go out

103
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty quickly I'm sure because a lot of</font>

104
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,269
people are talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

105
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,700
stuff so we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the best we can but</font>

106
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,079
we got to kind of like get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ball</font>

107
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,540
rolling again it sucks but that's just

108
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,000
how it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what comes to my book</font>

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,199
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> telling you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've been</font>

110
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">waiting on the cover to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for to</font>

111
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,190
publish it well I've shot photos for the

112
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,269
cover I went out with Brian names their

113
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:27,829
nights and we shot some really cool

114
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,599
photos or well he did and I kind of just

115
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,609
was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give my two cents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

116
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:33,260
not really big on photography as book

117
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,180
covers usually but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely trust</font>

118
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,370
Brian aims for the camera at all costs

119
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,840
if that's the right thing to say but

120
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,849
yeah seriously I trust Brian<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ames he</font>

121
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:42,680
comes out with awesome stuff and he just

122
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,419
has to put the cover together using

123
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:45,919
those photos<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then send it to me and</font>

124
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,569
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can kind of get it published so</font>

155
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,850
involved with it too now here's an idea

156
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:42,080
that I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of wanted to tell you guys</font>

157
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,030
about lately i've been i've been doing a

158
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,290
lot of skate footage like I have like

159
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,510
one or more skate videos a day recently

160
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,490
and I kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do more footage</font>

161
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,010
that doesn't necessarily to be skating

162
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,480
like I I've always done skate footage

163
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,650
and I'm always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do skeet but</font>

164
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,090
it's not gonna change you're always

165
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,070
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a lot of skating on my</font>

166
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,600
channels<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't worry about that but I</font>

167
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,430
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start doing a lot more that</font>

168
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,990
doesn't have to do with just

169
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,190
skateboarding so like because I know I

170
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,419
have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that watch my</font>

171
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,310
videos just read talking parts and the

172
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,800
don't specifically like don't end it and

173
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily skate so I kind</font>

174
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,669
of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more of those videos and I</font>

175
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:15,590
had an idea for like a news like a

176
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,930
weekly news<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit on my channel it may</font>

177
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,280
actually Manny Santiago gave me this

178
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,540
idea because he had an Instagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

179
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about how he liked skated for</font>

180
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,630
children at a school and the news

181
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,820
wouldn't you know wouldn't cover it but

182
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,020
they would cover the negative stuff they

183
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:27,800
always do and I was like yeah that's

184
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,390
totally true and it's kind of annoying

185
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,800
like I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a news thing where I</font>

186
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
talk about the good and the bad and I

187
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,160
would totally make this news bit goofy

188
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,900
thing just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these update videos like</font>

189
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,760
they would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and crazy but</font>

190
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,990
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time I talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about real</font>

191
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,000
issues so don't worry about it being

192
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,620
boring if I would not make it boring I

193
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,300
promise if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that idea give</font>

194
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,680
this video a thumbs up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to</font>

195
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,120
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a first episode the works when i get</font>

196
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560

197
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,790
something I want to do and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

198
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,200
more skits in general and I got some

199
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,450
ideas for those so be on the lookout and

200
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,580
if you don't see more like goofy stuff

201
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,169
