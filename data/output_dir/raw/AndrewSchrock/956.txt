00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to happen okay</font>

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,699
especially when you realize he was

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:22,470
walking<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime there's someone doing a</font>

5
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,539
tightrope act and a fall friday it's not

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and he did he totally did it</font>

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,810
look to get one of those given cartoons

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,040
when people slip on like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,809
marbles or home alone home alone go

12
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,370
watch that movie the<font color="#E5E5E5"> freaking when they</font>

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,620
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> henslowe did and he did</font>

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,360
well but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of an intense clip</font>

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets on the rail when</font>

16
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:41,879
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized what's gonna</font>

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,770
happen right away but it dictum to the

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,660
very end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rail the whole time</font>

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're like all right you're gonna fall</font>

20
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,750
right it's gonna happen sign me up for a

21
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,190
two-year contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> t-mobile okay because</font>

22
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,960
this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> down and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they did and then</font>

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,820
he actually fell I don't see why<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,289
didn't just jump off and<font color="#E5E5E5"> land on his</font>

25
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,460
board because that's what the trick was

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">because he's at the very end he could</font>

27
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,160
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of done it but except he</font>

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,390
was just like you know having to slip<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

29
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,250
a banana peel in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mario kart a freakin</font>

30
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,840
get us all don't they they do every

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody is guilty of hitting a banana</font>

32
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,510
peel in<font color="#E5E5E5"> mario kart you think you're</font>

33
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,560
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that but you're not get red</font>

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,210
shells are unavoidable banana peels are

35
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,740
you're still gonna hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> them Eric</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kinslow</font>

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,090
is not a red shell so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

37
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,799
that makes sense it doesn't probably

38
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,909
doesn't but the best thing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,200
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the fact that it's like the</font>

40
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,930
perfect dumb fall ever like it's a weird

41
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,759

44
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,810
Eric was doing this in the first place

45
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he got up and he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey I'm</font>

48
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,829
words were I'm not going to fall is what

49
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,990
