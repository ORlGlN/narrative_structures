know it's not like filmed as well as it

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,500
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how close that</font>

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,540
came to destroying my face and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,190
camera but if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board</font>

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,630
before I turn away and when the board

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,730
re-enters the camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can tell that</font>

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,190
it's like this close to the camera's

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:42,870
lens and my face was like right there

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:50,460
next to it was ridiculous<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that board</font>

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,530
was going like full speed as Alex kicked

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,059
it away so i probably would have to take

15
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,289
a trip to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hospital like maybe like</font>

16
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,329

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,060
on because they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just sit there</font>
