<font color="#E5E5E5">cold that day so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry I wasn't</font>

24
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,869
trick tricks together real fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have</font>

25
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,159
a lot of time to film it so the trucks

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,810
they sent me are these these are the

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,630
Clint Peterson<font color="#E5E5E5"> Orion SP ones and the</font>

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,770
first thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these trucks</font>

29
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,360
might put them on is that that my board

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,890
felt really light I was like man<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

31
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,869
this they do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hollowed-out kingpin</font>

32
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,340
so that definitely helps it's a little

33
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,960
dark I can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but it is hollowed</font>

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,110
out and um it's put together really well

35
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,570
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know feel solid my favorite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

36
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,490
about these trucks are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bushings okay</font>

37
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,740
usually when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a new pair of trucks</font>

38
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,990
I have to buy bushings like better

39
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,610
bushings and put them in because you

40
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,930
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can't get up tight enough or</font>

41
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,909
like when I land on impact and I'm just

42
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,530
like the truck will stay to one side and

43
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,210
I gotta like bend it like it kind of

44
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,760
smushed the bushings back but these like

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,680
I put the the trucks on that was

46
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,360
immediately it felt like it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken</font>

47
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,130
in it was fantastic like if I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

48
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,140
finally a pair of trucks that come with

49
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,720
bushings that aren't ridiculous so like

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,070
you gotta see you put them on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

51
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,140
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're good to go so that's</font>

52
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,580
definitely my favorite thing about Orion

53
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,580
trucks so I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> psyched to you know</font>

54
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,350
get my time out of these trucks trucks

55
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,449

57
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,200
