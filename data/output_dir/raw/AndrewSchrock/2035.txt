another skate spot and it's gloomy

50
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,130

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,739
way too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy remember when we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">over all right Andy schrock we're</font>

58
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,239
skating the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around cincinnati</font>

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,250

61
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,020
fun

00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,160
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we're seeing the</font>

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,750
biggest hand around cincinnati and

64
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,330
someone politely told us to leave so we

65
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,650
did he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing us a favor</font>

66
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,970
because that handrail is impossible do

67
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,770
anything on because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an inch</font>

68
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,840

<font color="#E5E5E5">late and that's our luck yeah that's our</font>
