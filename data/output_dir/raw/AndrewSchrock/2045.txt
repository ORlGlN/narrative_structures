written four books but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

various videos over the past year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

12
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:25,260

the first 20 pages if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

17
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:35,040
big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> even ninja think so because</font>

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,100
she's been meowing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you oh my gosh</font>

19
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so the general gist of my book</font>

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,790
is no secret it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coming-of-age story</font>

21
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,670
and it's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> not basically it is</font>

22
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,500
my story growing up it starts out

23
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,360
telling how i got into skateboarding and

24
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,379
then it goes throughout all the high

25
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,570
school years life as a skateboarder it

26
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,420
deals<font color="#E5E5E5"> with you know girl drama like</font>

27
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,820
relationships and deals with the party

28
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,739
life but the main theme is just

29
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,510
struggling with being different you know

30
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">feeling like you're just not like</font>

31
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone else and then that's not always</font>

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,250
a bad thing you know like I'm definitely

33
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,400
different but I love how I<font color="#E5E5E5"> am so but it</font>

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,260
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really good themes and if you</font>

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,299
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a skateboarder you will still</font>

36
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:13,680
like this book and if you're human at

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,860
all you were relate to it in some way

38
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,390
when I wrote it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote it for myself I</font>

39
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,240
was in a really dark time in my life and

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,710
it just so happens I started reading

41
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,240
Harry Potter randomly at the same time

42
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,799
and like that kind of like sucked me out

43
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,880
of it like I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really into harry</font>

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
potter and I was like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,140
want to write so of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just went</font>

46
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">through all the stuff so i sat down very</font>

47
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,259
first thing I wrote in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my entire life</font>

48
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,909
even in high school<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't really write</font>

49
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:39,270
papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it just didn't happen so I</font>

50
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,439
sat down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just as I was like all</font>

51
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:41,640
right I'll be a writer<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote this</font>

52
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,049
book and I showed it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few my friends</font>

53
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were they they loved it there</font>

54
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,110
like this is this is great stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> and II</font>

55
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,610
like you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to work you really</font>

56
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,579
need to do this and they passed to a few

57
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">other people and then I had people at</font>

58
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,610
that I didn't even know asking me to

59
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,590
read the book and within the first like

60
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,969
two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months after writing it</font>

61
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:02,180
probably about 40 people I'd read it and

62
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know for like a 300 page book that's</font>

63
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:07,610
that's a pretty good amount of people

64
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,479
but it's funny though a lot of non

65
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,000
readers have

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,770
the book and like they'll just read it

67
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,660
within like three days like then just

68
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,520
like won't stop reading it so you know

69
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,960
