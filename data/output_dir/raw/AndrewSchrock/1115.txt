7
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,980
why I'm sitting here on a couch talking

8
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,110
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I won't explain the year that</font>

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,060
was 2014 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this year was weird for a</font>

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,740
couple reasons one that I was off my

11
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,060
board for like four or five months

12
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,560
because I kept tearing my achilles

13
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,240
tendons and that made my weight

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,890
fluctuate up and down<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then finally I</font>

15
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,990
was like you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I am I could be</font>

16
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,430
skinnier so I got serious about losing

17
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,960
weight and I lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 35 pounds</font>

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,430
starting in September when I lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

19
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,750
way it was around the same time we moved

20
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,370
in shrek cars2 when I was skating every

21
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,260
day and I got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of my old tricks</font>

22
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,030
back like I feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new skateboarder</font>

23
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,670
in a sense and I'm when I was editing
