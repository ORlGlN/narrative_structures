manliest sport you could ever play so

5
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,309
you take your big bouncy ball and you

smash it with the nunchucks and this is

8
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:12,690

23
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,300
busy to some extent but it's kind of

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,620
nice because i usually have to wake up

25
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,210
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I got to the revenge orders and</font>

26

27
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,980

28
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,199
now my life is just slightly relaxing

29
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,120
it's awesome so with my lighter schedule

30
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,559
I've been getting my book ready for

31
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:57,600
publication which hopefully will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

32
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">in a couple weeks I'll have a video</font>

33
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">before then giving you a heads up but</font>

34
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,239
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as long another process as I</font>

35
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:04,500
thought it would be i got the manuscript

36
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,760
back from the editor so that's ready to

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,500
go now I just got to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cover</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

38
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,610
done and get that all good before I send

39
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,840
it off to the people and they're like

40
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,280
all right it will sell your book but

41
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,780
stay tuned because I will surely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

42
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,189
video talking about it and I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

43
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,780
some promo videos to try to hype it up

44
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">hahaha and of course I've been working</font>

45
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,200
on relaunching the new company I was

46
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,880
actually going to announce the new name

47
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,619
later today<font color="#CCCCCC"> but apparently we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

48
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,360
like let the trademark fully go through

49
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,220
so we have it that way if we announced

50
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,479
it and then Rick stick Jim over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

51
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be like oh my gosh i could totally</font>

52
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:33,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">trademark this faster and get it and</font>

53
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,460
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll have it and they won't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

54
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,020
to have it which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely unlikely</font>

55
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,520
and will be a complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> waste of Rick's</font>

56
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,040
take Jim's money but that potentially

57
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,119
could happen I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could try to</font>

58
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:43,799
sell<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so we'd be like no just pick a</font>

59
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,030
different name good job wasting your

60
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,189
money either<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we have a name and as</font>

61
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:48,689
soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm able to announce it I'll</font>

62
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,549
have a video up and everyone's going to

63
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:52,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">be like what why is it that name and</font>

64
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,270
then some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be like yes I like</font>

65
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,490
that name<font color="#E5E5E5"> either way we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

66
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,469
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> really excited and I'm I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

67
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:59,939
the name it's gonna be hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept</font>

68
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,430
any name because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really stuck on</font>

69
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,229
revenge like I like that name but<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

70
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">worry on it it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a pretty cool</font>

71
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:06,540
name and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> most people are gonna</font>

72
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,560
be like all right you know yeah I can

73
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,818
get used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this it's just going to take</font>

74
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:10,470
us some time because I know we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> miss</font>

75
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,940
revenge when it comes to product we're

78
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,050
of May if not the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of June we</font>

will be in full effect selling stuff and

80
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,430
it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a frenzy at first so if we</font>

81
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,230
sell out immediately I apologize but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

82
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,700
will get stuff back in as soon as

83
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,800

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm cleaning my desk screw you dirt one</font>

87
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,000
thing I want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this video</font>

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,920

95
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old videos from when I was growing</font>
