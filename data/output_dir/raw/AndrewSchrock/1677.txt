hey feel sorry for me not at all you

27
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,750
know at the very end of it when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

28
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,149
about 19 20 years old I got to this

29
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,230
point where I was like I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly</font>

30
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,559
thinking bad things and I'm not one to

31
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,600
give up I kept going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through it but when</font>

32
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,280
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> darkest moment I kind of had this</font>

33
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,750
revelation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was actually really into</font>

34
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,520
reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harry Potter at the time and the</font>

35
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,809
books motivated me and I was like I'm

36
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:02,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna write my own book so instead of</font>

37
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,709
like just being bummed on life I just

38
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,170
turned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all around and I wrote a story</font>

39
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,790
based on what I just gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> through it's</font>

40
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,560
um it's it's own story it's not an exact

41
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
account of what happened to me in my

42
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
life but it's highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on it and</font>

43
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,049
after a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> of writing this book I</font>

44
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:18,330
sent to a couple friends and they loved

45
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,740
it and the word got<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and they were</font>

46
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">sending it to people unlike within a</font>

47
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:23,130
month over like 40 to 50 people had read

48
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,840
it in half of my didn't know and these

49
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,580
people tell me like how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much my book</font>

50
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,560
impact them all the girls were told me

51
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,329
they were crying like during a lot of

52
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:31,590
parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I was just like whoa</font>

53
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,659
this is crazy so I was like all right

54
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:34,799
I'll try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this published so I</font>

55
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,450
spent a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my life trying</font>

56
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it published in it's really hard</font>

57
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,470
to break into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book game especially</font>

58
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,180
when you want try to get an agent it was

59
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,710
just a headache so I put it off in the

60
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,810
back burner and until recent years here

61
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,040
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube I was like all right I'm</font>

62
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,329
gonna do what I have to do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this</font>

63
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,130
book out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and let people see it</font>

64
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,020
because I really want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> book to get</font>

65
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,610
into the world and have an impact on it

66
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,610
the book is for anybody it honestly if

67
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a skateboarder or not a</font>

68
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,969
skateboarder a guy or girl<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you can</font>

69
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,770
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> something in this book it does have</font>

70
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,000
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with skating but it has a lot to</font>

71
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,619
do with like relationships and friends

72
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,810
and backstabbing and all that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

73
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,848
a big theme in it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> like feeling</font>

74
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,020
different than everyone else because

75
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,879
I've always felt different than everyone

76
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,980
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of great friends</font>

77
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,989
and close relationships but it's at the

78
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:17,400
same time I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like man I just don't</font>

79
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,200
feel like I'm like anybody else

80
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,970
sometimes and a lot of aspects so I

81
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,040
promise you no matter who you are you

82
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,599
can find something<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this book and most</font>

83
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,519
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have read it honestly it's</font>

84
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:29,730
like 350 pages they read it in like two

85
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,500
days so like I know that people just

86
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">like really have trouble putting it down</font>

87
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,620
and it's a really fast read don't let

88
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,060
that number scare you at all I've had

89
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,860
nothing but positive feedback on it and

90
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,230
I really think it can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in</font>

91
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,849
the world and I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a lot of</font>

92
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">people will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really like this book and I</font>

93
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,450

94
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,700
