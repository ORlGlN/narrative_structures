15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,580
making it was originally called skate

16
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,680
revenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we switched the name of</font>

17
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,689
the company to revive skateboards and i

20
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,399
really cool name for the video so we

21
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,840
rolled with it and if you watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

22
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,059
channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what I'm all about on</font>

23
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,590
here that's essentially what lips Kate

24
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,120
died is it's a full inkscape video it

25
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,300
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of all people on the team and</font>

26
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,610
it's just a very fun skate video and I

27
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,620
want people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to watch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and just be</font>

like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> there basically I want to</font>

32
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,280
make it a skate video that's

33
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,109
entertaining for anyone even if they

34
00:00:58,109 --> 00:00:59,760
don't necessarily skate that being said

35
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,890
it does follow a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very standard tradition</font>

36
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:03,899
of skate videos it's very skating

37
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,670
focused it does have some goofy stuff in

38
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,020
between parts but it's like you know

39
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,360
this part this part this part mixed in

40
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
with everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see in my channel</font>

41
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,479
like the goofiness and fun so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

42
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,010
came out really well and I've produced

43
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,380
five skate videos total in my life and

44
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,880
this one is my favorite hands down like

45
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,470
i love this video and i believe in it

46
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:21,090
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's the basic information of the</font>

47
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,890
video k the main part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video is 37</font>

48
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,270
minutes long it has your intro that has

parts from everybody that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has credits</font>

50
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,750
then it has like a goofy<font color="#E5E5E5"> screwin section</font>

51
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,970
at the end with the DVD it is thirteen

66
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">iTunes it was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a headache</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

67
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,180
and we were not<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it</font>

68
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,890
available on day one we're still working

69
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,659
on getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in on itunes but we don't</font>

70
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,939
know when so<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay tuned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that but you</font>

71
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,020
know if you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> set on getting an</font>

72
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,040
itunes it's going to be there eventually

73
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,229
if you want it day one the digital

74
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:08,848
download is right there for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so</font>

75
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:10,020
you're still going to get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital copy</font>

76
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,940
of it if you want to go that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap one</font>

77
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,590
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind everybody because we</font>

78
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,850
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of international customers</font>

79
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:18,030
that this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> North American DVD okay</font>

80
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,980
for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason the world</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decided</font>

81
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,390
that it was smart to make different

82
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,430
video players for different parts of the

83
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,730
world so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an NTSC video</font>

84
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,160
DVD player this is not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> play on</font>

85
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,480
your DVD player<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you live in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UK</font>

86
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,400
and check<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if you're on the pal</font>

87
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,770
format and if so get the digital

88
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,210
download and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been</font>

89
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">complaining like what about bonus</font>

90
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,510
fixtures um well the bonus features are

91
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,130
going to be an iTunes so you can either

92
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,900
wait for that or I might actually

93
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,640
release the bonus features for just for

94
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
like two bucks extra on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor store</font>

95
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,780
like as a digital download so I'm very

96
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry if that's the inconvenience for</font>

97
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,420
you it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the world works</font>

98
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,770
unfortunately but there are ways around

99
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,870
it you could always get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTSC DVD</font>

100
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,310
player like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how easy they</font>

101
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,710
are to get over<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UK or you might</font>

102
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,910
do some research and see if your

103
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">playstation can play it or your</font>

104
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">computers might be able to play it who</font>

105
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,650
knows just do your research because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

106
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,270
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want you to buy this and put it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">came together it was actually very</font>

129
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,500
difficult to put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a lot</font>

130
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,050
of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the team are busy busy</font>

busy filming YouTube videos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

132
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,310
it's like a job for some of us so it's

133
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,980
really tough to be filming daily videos

134
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,200
and get out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and skate and try</font>

135
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,090
something big for your part and put it

136
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,370
away so it was really hard for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

137
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,320
life is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a little easier across</font>

138
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,570
the board so hopefully when we film for

139
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,830
