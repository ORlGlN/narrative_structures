00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,659
pain a downpour of discomfort a

7
00:00:22,659 --> 00:00:24,849
hopscotch of hurt<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that last one was</font>

8
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:26,560
bad I'm sorry I could watch this video

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,210
as a stranger and just deduce why this

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:30,279
fall was not comfortable at all first

11
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,020
off the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> he got done falling you</font>

12
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,000
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious and told you exactly how he</font>

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,130
was feeling dude that hurts<font color="#E5E5E5"> so bad</font>

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,380
that's so bad if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad fall</font>

15
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,550
typically the person is not gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font>

16
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,510
you that right away<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they're</font>

17
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,710
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sit there and maybe laugh a</font>

18
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,910
little bit they're gonna have I don't

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,930
know think about where they're eating

20
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,370
for dinner lots of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> could happen</font>

21
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,750
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not gonna get super serious</font>

22
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,120
and say that's so bad also Alex didn't

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,470
even have to get up to realize he was

24
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,330
done trying that trick he I'm knew from

25
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,490

28
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,980
texted his aunt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> george lucas knew</font>

29
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,270
that he wasn't gonna continue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick</font>

30
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,220
because he knew from the get-go all

31
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,670

43
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,620
good landing tricks and not just falling

44
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,970
on ledges as you know if you've watched

45
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,380
my channel before and on the bright side

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,790
it could be a lot worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that fall</font>

47
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,290
wasn't that bad you know I'm sure it

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,610
hurts and I'm sure he got a hit bruise

49
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,290
but I'm that he was back on his board

50
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,820
like the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> day and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also it could be</font>

51
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,020
worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cuz he could have fallen</font>

52
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,220
legend than a bowling ball couldn't

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,510
leave old down the street in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head in</font>

54
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,740
fact that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good rule of thumb that</font>

55
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,570
anytime you're bummed you'd always get

56
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,560
hit in the head with a random bowling

57
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,700
