5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,109
in a chair clueless I am totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

6
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,400
clueless chair dude because when he

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,380
falls he throws his legs into the air

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,670
like normal people they're like you know

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:31,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I'm gonna try to get my feet on the</font>

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,420
ground to try to prevent my face from

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">being on next to or sliding across the</font>

12
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,070
concrete which is like no I'm gonna

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw my legs in the air look look at</font>

this picture so yeah I does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,040
then he hits the ground full-bodied and

16
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,559
just slides of a swan or snake as he

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,469
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be known as if I did this</font>

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,489
it would look more or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

19
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:54,629
this or this is literally a

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:55,860
skateboarding ninja because evil means

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,210
landing stuff it doesn t that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> body's</font>

22
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,320
just like flip it all over the place

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I swear if so you came in to me</font>

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do like a 20</font>

25
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">stare but I'm not actually gonna go down</font>

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,349
it i'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna somehow landed i'll be</font>

27
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:05,280
like you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know</font>

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means Jason but sure yeah you</font>

29
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,280
can do your 20s there without going down

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,600
it basically there's no understanding

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,580
Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> part cuz</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it defies everything laws</font>

32
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,280
physics restaurants<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he defies</font>

33
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,509
restaurants and I kind of feel bad

34
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,310
because when I'm watching him skate it's

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">hilarious like he's falling like this</font>

36
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,180
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughing after every shot and</font>

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,830
then I realized like after the fact I'm

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,450
like you know what that might have not

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,979
felt good sliding across like a swan

40
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:27,240
like I don't know of swans feel good

41
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,470
when they're falling on skateboards I've

42
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,000
never asked us one but he still wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,990
hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with me after all these</font>

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,939
sessions so I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like he's not bummed</font>

45
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:34,640
that I'm laughing at his Falls because

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,900
they are entertaining but on a real note

47
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jason park is my favorite skateboard</font>

48
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,079
room right now I'm gonna say that he is

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,700
my favorite skateboarder I'm lucky

50
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,990
enough to know him as a friend and i

51
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,610
skate with him and it's a blast like it

52
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,799
like it any spot you go to he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to skate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and he's gonna get you</font>

54
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,560
psyched on finding some weird way to

55
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">skate it and it's just he's oh my gosh</font>

56
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,880
he's inexperienced that's for sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

57
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,259
fortunate enough to film a lot of videos
