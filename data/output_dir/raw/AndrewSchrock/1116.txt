1
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,320
Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> Park people i mean honestly who's</font>

2
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,090
surprised that he fell right<font color="#E5E5E5"> there well</font>

3
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,700
I am and amped at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

4
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,590
he's a terrific at landing tricks at the

5
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,780
same time he<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a wonderful faller okay</font>

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,399
as you know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so many videos on</font>

7
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this that's the only reason why you</font>

8
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,980
shouldn't be surprised<font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz he is a</font>

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,450
talented skateboard if you look him up

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,760
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> alta vista it's weird that you're</font>

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,079
still using that search engine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still</font>

12
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:44,340
probably say that jay-z park is a

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:45,600
terrific skateboarder and that's what he

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,059
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> but he's also one beautiful faller</font>

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">i do want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put out that for Jason part</font>

16
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">falls usually they're kind of just funny</font>

17
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:52,859
but this one actually looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it</font>

18
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,750
hurt especially from the angle and I saw

19
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,920
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the top of the ledge</font>

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,600
staring down and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like almost in</font>

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,859
slow motion like I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I was</font>

22
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,239
watching our transformer movie it was

23
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,739
just like hip to ledge

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:11,360
pretty sure there was an explosion it

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,159
was like Michael Bay directed this fall

26
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:14,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and Jason Park did wonderfully a</font>

27
00:01:14,869 --> 00:01:16,430
guy he's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Shia LaBeouf of this</font>

28
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,600
skate spot just because everyone's

29
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about it yes I'm wearing a red</font>

30
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,140
shirt okay I'm dressed up people I got

31
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,000

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,950
need to gather some socials but back

33
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,090
Jason<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fall kind of came out of</font>

34
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,190
nowhere like everybody thought he was

35
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna land it I did because that's what</font>

36
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,490
he usually does he's lands tricks but

37
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,380
then all sudden boom i like it like the

38
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">friggin snap of a bottle rocket he was</font>

39
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,929
falling<font color="#CCCCCC"> and of course that means nothing</font>

40
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:40,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason part because he just got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and</font>

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,990
smiled about and I was like did you

42
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:43,460

51
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,990
sad he would smile like he finds the

52
