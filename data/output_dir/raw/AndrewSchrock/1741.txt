00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">hilarious things to watch on second</font>

6
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:25,830

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,970
thankful because I can totally just

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,170

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,240
staring at blank screens or something so

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe I'm not that thing for any more</font>

11
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:33,270

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,370
grumpy cat is here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet my</font>

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">mine I grew up skateboarding with him</font>

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,020
and he still skates this day but I'm

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,090
gonna let him remain nameless because of

19
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,039
the clip but I go easy on him<font color="#E5E5E5"> regardless</font>

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,539
he fell victim to the curse of

21
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,920
skateboarding now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this happens to the</font>

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,239
best of us k you look at a skate spot

23
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:53,280
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should not skate but your brain</font>

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,840
is like hey man you totally could nail a

25
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">chick on this somehow and it does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

26
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,750
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the best sometimes you know you</font>

27
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,609

28
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:01,350
heck ya I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go reward myself with</font>

29
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,180
some sour patch kids but other times it

30
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,500
does not work that way and you end up

31
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing something dumb like falling into</font>

32
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,070
sewage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I know it wasn't actual</font>

33
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,570
sewage water but he was still like pond

34
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,040
scum build up junk from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the creek</font>

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,500
regardless I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my friend</font>

36
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,670
looked at this pipe and thought you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

37
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> positive i'm</font>

38
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:18,420
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just you know slide in this</font>

39
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,409
nasty creek water oh I mean I'm sure

40
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:23,909
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to roll back and forth and</font>

41
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some fun but the thing wasn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

42
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,540
wide<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so is one that's gonna be hard</font>

43
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,430
and rule of thumb if you're rolling

44
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,860
through sludgy nasty slippery Creek

45
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,780
water you were done you're gonna slip

46
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,220
your wheels are gonna slip your feet are

47
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,200
gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> slip your face is gonna slip you</font>

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,460
were slipping and you're gonna go in

49
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,170
that water that's just how life works at

50
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,490
least for me and I feel kind of bad

51
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,990
because all of my funny clips you know

52
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,240
of dumb mistakes in the past have been

53
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,009
with my friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not me like I feel</font>

54
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,540
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go do something stupid</font>

55
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,009
so I can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun of myself here on the</font>

56
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet you know what I'm actually</font>

57
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,439
think that maybe I should go to the

58
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,030
sewer and tried because if I land it

59
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,380
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> boom I just did something pretty</font>

60
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,049
pretty weird maybe not awesome but if I

61
00:01:58,049 --> 00:01:59,520
fall it's gonna be a good clip right so

62
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">could I give it a thumbs up if I hit</font>

63
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">2,000 thumbs up I will go and try this</font>

64
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,460
