which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what this video is about I feel</font>

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,300
crazy sometimes you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just feel</font>

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,500
like when I tell people what I want to

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,990

12
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,369

<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about i want to change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

15
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,300
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know like that yeah like when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

16
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,470
growing up I used to watch superhero

17
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,539
movies and I was like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save the</font>

18
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:31,949
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> someday and granted okay there's</font>

19
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,750
no supervillain so I can't really go and

20
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,820
save the day per se<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when I got older</font>

21
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,020
that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> change does something</font>

22
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">different and I just wanted to have a</font>

23
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,540
positive effect in the world okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

24
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,910
wanted to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and do something</font>

25
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,290
that mattered like what I'm gone I want

26
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to be like you know what Andy did</font>

27
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,250
it was worth something like we care to

28
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about that still because when it</font>

29
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,460
comes to some crazy monumental things in

30
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,020
the world it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by people that</font>

31
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,489
just played it safe you know like Martin

32
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,199
Luther King he wasn't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what</font>

33
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,149
I'm just gonna be mellow<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we're</font>

34
00:00:57,149 --> 00:00:58,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">not worried about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know racial</font>

35
00:00:58,649 --> 00:00:59,850
freedom in this country is not too big

36
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a deal no he didn't he got up and</font>

37
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:02,850
stood up and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and they</font>

38
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,930
were like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people were like well</font>

39
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,400
yeah that's great and all but there's

40
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">just too much racial tension in this</font>

41
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,130
country people will not accept it but he

42
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,659
helps do it along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some other</font>

43
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,760
awesome brave souls out there like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

44
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,200
know like the world's<font color="#CCCCCC"> come a long way</font>

45
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,360
since what America used to be and that's

46
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just an example like there are plenty of</font>

47
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,240
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done great things that</font>

48
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you people still talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in schools</font>

49
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,869
and online and in internet memes

50
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:23,490
whatever you know but I'm saying like

51
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,930
there are people out there that did

52
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,369
things and people thought they were

53
00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:28,020
crazy you know like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing is going to</font>

54
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,030
happen if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people don't take a risk and</font>

55
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,549
dream crazy dreams if you don't have

56
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,500
those dreams and you don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

57
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,700
things nothing is ever going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

58
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,320
so I kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this video to</font>

59
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,780
say if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have an idea or you want to</font>

60
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">do something with your life even if it's</font>

61
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,799
super far-fetched do not care what

62
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:45,780
people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if that's what means</font>

63
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,740
something to you and that's what you

64
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,659
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do let them think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're crazy</font>

65
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,579
get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do it like I make</font>

66
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,159
active steps to reach this crazy thing

67
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you probably think is impossible</font>

68
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if it isn't possible you don't do it</font>

69
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,350
so what you tried you know and the

70
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,549
people that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hating on you</font>

71
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,689
you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> play it safe their whole</font>

72
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:02,490
life and you know get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to live in him</font>

73
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,110
like man I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> glad I worked a normal job</font>

74
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,060
with normal things happening in my life

75
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,680
but the people that try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something</font>

76
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,300
different there life even if they fail

77
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,318
they're going to look back and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

78
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,790
man that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an adventure at least I</font>

79
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,989
tried to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there's a</font>

80
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:13,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">moment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my life</font>

81
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,840
or I was just living outside the normal

82
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,120
and it was fresh and exciting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

83
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,340
honest to myself so that's my two cents

84
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,140
whatever it is starting a company being

85
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,409

90
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,870
