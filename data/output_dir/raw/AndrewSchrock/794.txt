complete skateboard this is the last set

up ice skated before this one and it's

36
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,590
in really good condition the reason why

37
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,000
I stopped skating this is because I

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,439
needed to set up a new deck for a

39
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,030
certain video for one of the newer

40
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,310
graphics to be in and I've had this

41
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:22,200

45
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,310

skated but it's it's in perfect

55
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,939
condition the wheels were 52 at one

56
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,110
