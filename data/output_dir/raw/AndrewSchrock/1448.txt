00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,110
I'm gonna do this is that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

36
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">of two random words and you guys have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,950
guess these words it could be anything

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,530
okay like any word from<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything it's</font>

39
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,600
probably going to be vulgar FYI but

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,920
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go down in the comments</font>

41
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:49,470
and just type one word per comment and

42
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,600
you can comment as many times as you

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,430
want if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you really want to but you're</font>

44
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,050

45
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,880
random words<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,430
gets one of them gets a book<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then so</font>

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person that gets the other</font>
