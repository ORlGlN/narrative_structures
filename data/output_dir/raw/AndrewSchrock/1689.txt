00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,960
time we tried this trick and it was

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to do this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trick because I</font>

00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,530
a ballerina or a gymnast or anything I

14
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">was like wobbly and then I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to time</font>

15
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,100
it right and jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I had to have</font>

16
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,540
faith that Sam was going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at</font>

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,430
the same speed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same spot because</font>

18
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,479
I couldn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the board was</font>

19
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,670
coming from so it was really really

20
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,259
really tough to get this trick and of

21
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,790

22
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,410

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,820
and it was such a funny like experience

25
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,050
