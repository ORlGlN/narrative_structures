hilarious video and I put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the info</font>

58
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,140
like this is not animal abuse we didn't

60
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,530
let him do his thing he played then he

61

played dead like he wasn't hurt at all

62
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:05,009
and then he flew away but i guess like

63
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,960
just putting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word animal abuse and</font>

know if I'm gonna release it publicly

73

74
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,440

really safely i might release it but

79
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,380

book and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ninety-five percent</font>

92
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,480
exactly how it went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down I sprinkle a</font>

93
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,740
little bit of fiction in here to like

94
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,750
wrap the book up and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

95
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,580
connect the dots and certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but</font>

96
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,650
like a lot most of it is absolutely true

97
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,690
and the rest of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its like highly based on</font>

98
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,690
relevance Shane<font color="#E5E5E5"> jadhav says why did you</font>

101
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,770
always wanted kids that's when the time

102
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,940
is right for something you just do it

103
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I love my wife and I'm super happy</font>

104
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,420
and riding is the best thing that's ever

105
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,190
happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me so to all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you people who</font>

106
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,750
think that like that's like the end of

107
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,459
life or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot you guys are crazy if</font>

108
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:33,870
you're married<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the right person and</font>

109
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,550
having kids for the right reasons it's

110
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,900
literally the best thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

111
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and hasn't slowed me down one bit</font>

112
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,290
I still skate and I still get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

113
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,150
goofy videos like my life is exactly the

114
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,770
same I just get to share with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

115
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,280
people ever so Adam Cooper asks a

116
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,450
question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been asking</font>

117
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,770
for their entire lives<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I keep</font>

118
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,420
answering it but nobody processes it

119
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,920
fully he says deserve I've ship

120
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,270
internationally if so how much were

121
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">posters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to Australia at we have</font>

122
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,750
from day one shipped internationally and

123
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,180
I answered it probably about like 500

124
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">times like people keep asking this</font>

125
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,820
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes we ship internationally</font>

126
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,040
it is expensive that's something we

127
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,170
can't control like our country's charge

128
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,600
what they charge so I'm sorry I can't do

129
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,920
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the price but when it</font>

130
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,330
comes down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it it's still cheaper than</font>

131
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,090
like a deck in other countries so do

132
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,738
your research even if shipping is more

133
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,910
expensive of the board it doesn't mean

134
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,850
you're paying

135
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,380
more than you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your country if</font>

136
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,060
that makes sense either way when there's

137
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,470
an issue on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet just do some</font>

138
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,760
research go to the website and try to

139
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,840
order it and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much it costs</font>

140
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,220
that's the better way of doing things

141
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,350
Danny Sanchez asks would you ever go

142
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,880
down a mega ramp if so a chick would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,890
do off it easy yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to think</font>

144
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I would try the mega ramp and my</font>

145
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,830
trick would be getting to the other side

146
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,720
in one piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> and surviving and if I did</font>

147
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,820
that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like flew across it and slid</font>

148
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,320
down the thing I would be so psyched if

149
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,330
I ever actually a lien rolled away then

150
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:44,980
I don't know I'll do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something really</font>

151
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,260
creates on<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube albin or mcgard says</font>

152
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,120

good as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you used to be at skating and to</font>

172
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,050
me it's kind of weird thing because I

173
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,700

178
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,980
back then but I definitely went bigger

179
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,920
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past and I feel like if I just</font>

180
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,450
got some time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually spend on my</font>

181

<font color="#E5E5E5">I was kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of lazy with it at first but</font>

206
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,400
things kept selling out and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept</font>

207
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,840
it going and eventually I pulled my

208
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,570
buddy Brian<font color="#CCCCCC"> names in and him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we just kind of got it going for real</font>

211
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,670
and I learned as I went but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest</font>

212
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,740
thing I did right when it<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to</font>

213
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,330
revenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> revived is that I built an</font>

214
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,100
audience before I had product so when I

215
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,450
started the company i had people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

216
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,280
already wanted the stuff so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

217
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,230
like the big thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> made me</font>

222
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and doing fairly well is because I</font>

223
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,640
did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of backwards and i created</font>

224
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,410

make the trips happen in like a weekend

24 7 so whenever I can get time with her

244
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,990
I take it but overall the family life is

245
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">rocking it's just it is stressful though</font>

246
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,770
we're all really busy except ridin

247
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:49,540
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's two ducks and mcdougald</font>

248
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,010
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question he says do you</font>

249
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,120
ever wonder what your life would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like</font>

250
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
if you didn't start skateboarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

251
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,110
first place and I would want to be a

252
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,900
nerve because i'm a nerd now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

253
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i probably i'd like to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font>

254
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,760
would be in video of some sort because i

255
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,850
have passion for video but I it's been

256
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,680
such<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big part of my life it's so weird</font>

257
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,020
to fathom what I would be doing maybe I

258
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,310
would have gotten to like the video game

259
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,170
industry because I've always had a

260
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,900
passion for that but wow world without

261
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,000
skateboarding for me it's very hard to

262
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine so I'd be a nerd of some sort</font>

263
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,570
dork a geek whatever you want to call me

264
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,810
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh it's hard to pinpoint exactly</font>

265
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,460
what I'm sorry but that's it guys I

266
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,390
would do another one of these in like a

267
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,040
month or so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do it more often</font>

268
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,390
because I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys like this and</font>
