5
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,200

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,210
I swear this is how I heard this so

7

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:15,870
house-sitting while the owners are<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,910
inside the house there's a dog okay well

10
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,859
unfortunately the dog dies while she's

11
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:21,869
watching the place I know it's very sad

12
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:23,880
don't you blah blah but she tells the

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,410
owners<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they're like you know there</font>

00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,789
of course percent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell her to</font>

15
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,740
call the vet so she calls the vet and

16
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,500
says hey this dog died come and get it

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,660

23
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,309
a weirdo carrying a dead dog on the

24
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,440
subway<font color="#CCCCCC"> and across the city so she did</font>

25
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,090
what any house-sitting girl would do and

26
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,100
she puts the dog in a suitcase genius

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,350
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> she sets out with the dog case and</font>

28
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,030
everything is going smooth she walks few

29
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,590
blocks into the subway she rides the

30
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,329
subway tour stop this is where things

31
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,219
get rough she hits a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> stairs and</font>

32
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,739
the puppy pack isn't really light okay

33
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,600
so Chaz Lipp Thomas Ayers was hard and

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,489
she's struggling probably not too

35
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,990
psyched on what's going on when a guy

36
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,880
walks up and says like hey you need some

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,950

<font color="#CCCCCC">shining armor so she's relieved and</font>

40
00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:16,710
thankful and she says yes the man smiles

41
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,780
and grabs a suitcase and he takes one

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">step of the stairs turns around and</font>

45
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,240
suitcase let that sink in okay he ran

46
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,130
off thinking he had just stolen

47
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,650
something worthwhile he's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> super</font>

48
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,030

54
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:53,340
