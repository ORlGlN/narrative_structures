11
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,720

picture that<font color="#CCCCCC"> makes you go wait what like</font>

13
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,250
the one I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing lately boom a</font>

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,019
pain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a time of giving birth a woman</font>

16
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,710
feels up to 57<font color="#CCCCCC"> dells of pain what now</font>

17
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:32,940
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by saying I'm not</font>

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking trash on women who give birth</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's not the issue with this I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">given birth and I'm sure it's something</font>

22
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:40,620
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't comprehend how painful it</font>

23
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,360
is for a woman to have a natural birth

24
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,309
my issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this me more graphic or</font>

25
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:45,390
whatever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it is that</font>

26
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,579
it's idiot it contradicts itself I feel

27
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,050
like anybody with a brain can read that

28
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,579
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a no clearly that does not make</font>

29
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,440
sense so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human body can only bear up</font>

30
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,149
to this much amount of pain<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

31
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:55,949
but when a woman is giving birth boom

32
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:57,930
she endures this much<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what does</font>

33
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,430
that make her not human<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is she a</font>

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,710
monster a Jedi a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin Pokemon master</font>

35
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,300

36
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,459
body can bear only<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to 45</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dells of</font>

37
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,960
pain okay logically when you get above
