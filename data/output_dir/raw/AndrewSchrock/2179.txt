I think the logical trick for me would

32
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:02,670
be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> three flip because I do so many</font>

33
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,719
three flips like I love them they're

34
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:06,060
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> my warmup trick and I do them every</font>

35
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,970
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're just what I do</font>
