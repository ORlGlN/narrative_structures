youtube what is up guys so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was sitting</font>

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,690
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my computer earlier today and I saw</font>

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,519
these two clips of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five I figure 5</font>

4
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:15,900
out and it got me thinking I was like

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,130
one I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this has ever been on</font>

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,990
my channel before and 2 i'm pretty sure

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've never seen anyone else do this</font>

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:21,869
trick so i did some research on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

9
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:22,920
internet there's a really cool site

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,990
called youtube com where you can you can

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,460
search through videos people<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload them</font>

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,840
you watch them it's awesome so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">some searching I went through about 10</font>

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,080
pages and I could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> find any clip of</font>

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,910

dude doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 50 like flip out where he</font>

17
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,570
grabs the nose of his board but that's a

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,710
different trick than what i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing but</font>

19
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,730
