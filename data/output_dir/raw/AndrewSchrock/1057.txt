64
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,229
light switch in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your head needs to go on</font>

specifics i'm talking about i'm just

69
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,899
saying it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to be bad at something</font>

70
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,619
and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're so dead set on is</font>

74
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,160
better at it or

75
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,810
