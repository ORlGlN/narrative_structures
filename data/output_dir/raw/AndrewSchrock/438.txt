5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,340
question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pops into my brain when I</font>

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,439
watch this and then I think like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh he</font>

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,489
on a skateboard he's handstand grinding

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,680
falling is the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely thing to</font>

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,010
happen nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's amazing he's one of</font>

11
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most unique skateboards in the whole</font>

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,410
world I can actually do a handstand

<font color="#E5E5E5">grind and of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course flip out and then he</font>

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:48,059
says the board flying my direction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

15
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:49,890

<font color="#E5E5E5">so like like that trick is so insane</font>

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,219
that that's the way he fell is the most

22
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,019
outstanding part of this if you don't be

23
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,580
a clip of some guy like handstand

24
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,720
grinding you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy's about</font>

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,729
to fall how does he do it I'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font>

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:10,439
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he slips out hits his face on</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">dude like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what he's bending down to grab</font>

29
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,600
the board he likes p messes up that way

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
926 the trick<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i would just</font>

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,990
assume that he wouldn't get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that far</font>

32
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,270
because it's such a crazy trick Carlos

actually suck at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trick mainly</font>

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,530

no one really<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that Carlos is in</font>

41
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,700
real danger during this clip it's just

42
