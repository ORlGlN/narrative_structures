1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
youtube what's up guys so yes it's one

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,790
of those videos<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'm walking around</font>

3
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,920
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about something serious ish in</font>

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,540
nature I mean honestly like a Disney

5
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,189
movie could erupt at any moment any time

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,500
any place not any place here because I'm

7
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,700
in nature but whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get what I'm</font>

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,150
saying stick don't you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I just</font>

9
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">snapped that like a twig because it was</font>

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,810
a twig what I'm talking about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hate</font>

11
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,130
I've never addressed hate comments

12
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really on my channel I mean I've done</font>

13
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,490
skits based on hate comments because I

14
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,689
was kind of funny but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really</font>

15
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:25,949
talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a good</font>

16
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,539
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I haven't talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it but</font>

17
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:29,010
I'm talking about it for your benefit

18
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">and right now on this video so you see</font>

19
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:32,729
hate comments everywhere the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font>

20
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,680
a great place for people just to sit at

21
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,750
their chair and type mean things to

22
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,760
people for whatever reason I'm sure what

23
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,920
humans are an interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing they're</font>

24
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,239
interesting creature you know like

25
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,350
that's why people sit around gossip

26
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,120
about all the bad things happening to

27
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,590
other people it's basically the news and

28
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,879
a nutshell but seriously like it's

29
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,260
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our brains think it's</font>

30
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,629
entertaining to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> trash on people</font>

31
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:53,160
like you know not everybody like none

32
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,809
most people don't like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk</font>

33
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:57,449
trash by people but you do see it mildly

34
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,039
even if it's just like sort of gossip

35
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,750
amongst people it's just something in

36
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,760
our brains<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and some people take</font>

37
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,470
that to a new level where it's like I am

38
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to try to hurt people's feelings</font>

39
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,350
because that does something for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

40
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,390
it's a super weird concept because my

41
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,770
view on life is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what I'm</font>

42
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,360
gonna be worried about me I really do

43
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,490
not care what you have going on that I

44
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,110
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with you know if you want my</font>

45
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:17,189
opinion sure i'll give it to you but I

46
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:18,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">still respect you as a person you know</font>

47
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you respect me and to each his</font>

48
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,340
own unless it gets more detailed like if

49
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,299
you're a close friend you're doing

50
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,470
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like step in</font>

51
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,729
and say you're hurting yourself that's

52
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:27,900
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna</font>

53
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">sit here and just talk trash hurt</font>

54
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,659
feelings is my point behind all of this

55
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,280
a lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get that is ok to</font>

56
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,659
have different opinions than everyone

57
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,400
else like I wear red shirts Jimmy

58
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,810
doesn't like red he wears blue shirts

59
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,759
Jimmy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I could still hang out it</font>

60
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,049
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually still be</font>

61
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,820
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> but some people feel like they</font>

62
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,380
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just blast their opinion in your</font>

63
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">face in a mean way and there's a</font>

64
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,470
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between like saying hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

65
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this and hey I'm gonna punch this</font>

66
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,759
in your face with words<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in your</font>

67
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">brain your brains just got punched with</font>

68
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:54,840
the word it I didn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but that</font>

69
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">being said as much as all of that makes</font>

70
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,840
sense it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna stop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people from</font>

71
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,670
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like just actually hurt you to</font>

72
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,719
the core on the internet people like to

73
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:01,829
say the meanest things the world like

74
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,119
I've seen some of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've I</font>

75
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,500
saw someone say that to someone in

76
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,060
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would step in and be like I</font>

77
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,439
kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to punch you right now I'm</font>

78
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,000
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna punch you right now</font>

79
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,378
unless you're like threatening somebody

80
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:12,330
but I kind of want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to because rude</font>

81
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,360
people come on

82
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,580
like seriously like what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that do</font>

83
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,320
for you so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say is that you</font>

84
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,000
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignore the hate comments okay</font>

85
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,830
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> weird because you can get 10</font>

86
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,570
comments or like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean like</font>

87
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube comments but take it</font>

88
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,930
is that way if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but you get</font>

89
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 nice things said about you and then</font>

90
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,350
one person comes out and makes fun of

91
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,000
your nose and you're like oh my gosh my

92
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
nose just heard about how awesome your

93
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,940
ears where but your nose sucks and that

94
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,190
one comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your nose is gonna get</font>

95
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,230
to you it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> human instinct it's</font>

96
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,330
just the way we work<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay negative</font>

97
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,250
comments get twist<font color="#E5E5E5"> I grab us and they're</font>

98
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,860
like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just make grunting noises cuz</font>

99
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no sucks but the important thing</font>

100
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,470
to remember about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you</font>

101
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,080
literally had<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten other people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say nice</font>

102
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,300
things about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's it's funny</font>

103
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,500
that those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just I mean the mean</font>

104
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,760
a lot you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get nice</font>

105
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,070
comments but those don't hit you as much

106
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:58,870
as the negative ones do so what I'm

107
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,280
saying in life this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen</font>

108
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,510
across the board or gonna have that one

109
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,860
co-worker that just sucks that you want

110
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to trip and they're gonna have a lot of</font>

111
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,620
nice people like cost you all the nice

112
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,020
people ignore the hate seriously like it

113
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,420
does not hurt you at all if people are

114
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,760
hating on you it's fine like it's

115
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,200
literally fine just ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> them and get</font>

116
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,520
on with it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cash out on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

117
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,780
positive stuff it's gonna work out<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

118
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,799
you I know this is like the cheesiest

119
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:19,120
thing I've ever done this has to be the

120
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">she's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this video I've ever done but it's</font>

121
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">true I get a ton of people saying mean</font>

122
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,980
things about the internet but you got a

123
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,330
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of use at the same</font>

time for everyone hate comment I get I'm

or more i have no idea a lot but

127
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:32,410

128
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,640

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I just off</font>

133

four leaf over I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> found one</font>

134
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,810
before if it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cloverfield</font>

135
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,130
never going to find it again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I saw it</font>

136
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if you're one of those people that</font>

137
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,370
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> take hate comments bad</font>

138
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,860
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I which is just highly to</font>

139
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,450
toughen yourself up a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

140
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,340
even outside of the internet the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world</font>

141
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,989
is a kind of sucky place for that like

142
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:56,890
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna be that guy that</font>

143
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,989
drives buying this big truck<font color="#CCCCCC"> and saying</font>

144
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:00,459
something stupid at you think of it in a

145
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,350
comedic way<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the way I see people</font>

146
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,330
complaining on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is kind of</font>

147
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,950
like a cereal aisle<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I know that</font>

148
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,420
sounds weird like for instance there's

149
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,760
people that I repeatedly hate on my

150
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,260
videos it's like okay you don't like my

151
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,459
videos but yet you're going on to
