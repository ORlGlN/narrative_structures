14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,090

the face with their skateboard in real

18
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,060
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> but every time it happens I'm just</font>

19
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,440
assumed the worst like your<font color="#E5E5E5"> jaw is just</font>

20
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,300
ok to do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine that you jaws just</font>

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,590

25
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,670
rolling away and then he lost his

26
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,990
balance and just smacked him in the face

27
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,900

world

38
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:18,890

39
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,479
skateboard but I mean that was quick

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay it kind of reminds me of what a dog</font>

41
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:23,960
bites a person here notice that like

42
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,969
dogs are super quick with biting I

43
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:27,829
didn't waste time they go from cute dog

44
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:31,780
face to snap at your face like that

45
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,829
that's kind of what happened Craig

46
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:35,600
skateboard was a dog biting his face

47
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,069
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was watching this clip I kind of</font>

48
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,000
thought I was like yeah you know what

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">other sports still gonna deal with this</font>

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I realized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this gate borders we kind</font>

51
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:42,619
of have it<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky because as horrible as</font>

52
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,390
it is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a skateboard to the face I</font>

53
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,619
mean I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> much rather have a</font>

54
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:46,670
skateboard of the face<font color="#E5E5E5"> could hit by a</font>

55
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,380
baseball or a hockey puck I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

56
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,939
of hockey puck to the face I'll be like

57
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,619
a 60 mile an hour piece of rubber to

58
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:53,450
tooth so be thankful Craig at least

59
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,250
there's that but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was super scary and</font>

60
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,840
Craig<font color="#E5E5E5"> really took it like it like a man</font>

61
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">like he was just like you got a SAT</font>

62
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,450

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,020
skateboard and he was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> fine he</font>

65
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,009
stopped skating he was trying to

66
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:06,020
nosegrind shove it down the hubba which

67
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,149
was insane for this try he just stuck

68
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nose grind and did that 2k he was</font>

but it didn't have any actual injuries

73
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,280
like that could have been so much worse
