was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of fed up with where was</font>

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,590
a direction that I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I have a</font>

78
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,819
lot of passions and I have a lot of

79
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,519
dreams and I don't want to end up in

80
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,530
some career that's just making me money

81
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,629
to get by you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

82
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,459
what life's about I have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> motto it's</font>

83
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,569
like live for what you love because

84
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:43,950
everything else is gonna be pointless

85
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,530
eventually and I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say like you</font>

86
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,060
know when you're 80 you're not gonna

87
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">look back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and be like heck yeah man I</font>

88
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,510
frickin I just worked a job that I

89
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,739
didn't really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it didn't make me</font>

90
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,170
happy for 450 years it's like that's

91
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,599
stupid and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

92
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,150
be so one year ago I set a personal goal

93
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,950
for myself I said within three years

94
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,769
that's August 2012 I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be at</font>

95
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:05,970
a certain point in my life you know

96
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,290
doing a certain thing and I'm not going

97
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go into details but I think i'm</font>

98
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,980
moving along really nicely on that goal

99
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm on the right track and you know</font>

100
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">since it's been one year since i said</font>

101
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,019
this goal for myself I've been kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

102
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,030
molded over and it's really made me want

103
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,889
to say some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you guys now I</font>

104
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,030
know I have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of different age</font>

105
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,709
groups to watch my videos but no matter

106
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:24,209
what point you're at during your life is

107
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:25,500
you know it's never<font color="#E5E5E5"> too late to switch</font>

108
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,870
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking direction you're going but</font>

109
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,220
what I really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is that you</font>

110
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,810
know if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dream or you want to</font>

111
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,549
do something don't let anyone tell you

112
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:35,700
that you can or can't do anything you

113
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,989
know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not if you're a minor I'm not</font>

114
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,430
saying don't listen your parents but a

115
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,590
lot of older people a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> well anyone</font>

116
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,049
will tell you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard it is to do</font>

117
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:44,489
something or they'll discourage you all

118
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,739
day and you know it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

119
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,450
because they're not happy because they

120
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,310
didn't end up doing something that they

121
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,680
love and that's just ridiculous its

122
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,299
course is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be hard you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

123
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,769
it's it is hard to make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this world</font>

124
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,599
it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it in this world doing</font>

125
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,760
something you love but you know that

126
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,470
doesn't mean you shouldn't try because

127
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,480
you honestly can't accomplish anything

128
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,359
you want if you really set your<font color="#CCCCCC"> freaking</font>

129
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind and heart to it whatever you do</font>

130
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,629
during this don't get so discouraged and

131
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:11,220
don't let things really drag you down

132
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,349
because along the way it's gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

133
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:15,419
bumpy ride ok friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> are gonna stab you</font>

134
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:16,978
in the back you know girlfriends or

135
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,539
boyfriends or whatever you have are

136
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,399
gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> frickin break your heart it's not</font>

137
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,530
an easy journey but you have to keep

138
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,639
fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

139
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,680
because in the end you know I would much

140
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,710
rather say that I gave it my all and win

141
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,479
for something I loved and had that

142
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,490
adventure then settled from the get go

143
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,490
on a freaking mediocre life that's not

144
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,050
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want and that's what I'm doing</font>

145
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">with all this in my freakin three-year</font>

146
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,539
goal I'm not settling for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin</font>

147
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:44,520
mediocre life so I'm not trying to be

148
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,139
cheesy by this video whatsoever and I'm

149
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:48,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry if it came across that way but I</font>

150
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,370
just say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> again if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dream if</font>

151
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,469
you have an ambition if you want to do

152
00:04:52,469 --> 00:04:54,599
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your life then do it and</font>

153
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,310
