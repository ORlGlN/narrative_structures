3
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,680
he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like part of the family and when he</font>

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,240
does things like this it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,130
that much more psyched on him I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,960
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thank you Thank You Thomas I know</font>

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,460
this could happen to anyone but I mean I

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,780
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when Thomas doesn't it just</font>

9
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,180
has like a spark of magic or like Disney

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,128
or like freshly baked cookies sprinkled

11
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:33,660
onto it because he like he flips his leg

12
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,249
does like a backward somersault on the

13
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:36,780
bank and then runs up like a little

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,329
puppy but like ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a skateboard</font>

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,829
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again then he</font>

16
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,359

17
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:48,149

19
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,359

20
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">get too worried about him being hurt and</font>

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,879
then he<font color="#CCCCCC"> just said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know like I could</font>

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,929
just watch people doing backwards

23
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,789
somersault down banks all the day

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,139
they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like I wake up and watch</font>

28
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:04,500
any normal skateboarder this type of

29
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,700
thing has happened to you it if it

30
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,080
hasn't you need to go do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like go to</font>

31
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,550
your local skate park and go try to a

32
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,200
50-50 saw and let<font color="#E5E5E5"> your feet fall over</font>

33
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,550
and you're gonna gently roll back

34
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,870
although if you don't have a bank you're

35
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,100
probably gonna hit your head so maybe

36
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,450
you shouldn't do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still it does</font>
