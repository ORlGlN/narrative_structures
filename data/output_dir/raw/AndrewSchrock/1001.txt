<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm kind of slipping out but I don't</font>

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,620

if you know if it wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

45
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,240
might have led to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the double flip he</font>

46
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,860
wouldn't have flipped at four flips I do
