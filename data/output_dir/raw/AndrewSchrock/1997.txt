in all honesty uh I don't usually free

106
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,360
again like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that unless I'm trying to</font>

109
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,550
moment or sometimes don't do it skating

but no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like I'm not like walking</font>

111
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,880
on the grocery store like flipping out

112
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,739
about avocados or something adage don't

113
00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:18,239
do that or do I

114
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,700
you know I'm kind of offended that you

115
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,110
would even ask that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

116
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,590
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is no I will not answer</font>

117
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">your question you're freaking Rick stick</font>

favorite pro skater Jamie Thomas hands

120
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,920
down

121
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,280
yes in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with music a lot more</font>

122
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">than you guys probably think um but for</font>

123
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,600
those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

124
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,470
outro music this well that's from a song

125
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:58,289
that I wrote but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a band i</font>

126
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:00,360
have a name<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i produce</font>

127
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,509
but I basically I come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a song i</font>

128
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,009
read it on the guitar<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just singing</font>

129
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,050
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i take it to my friend and when</font>

130
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,240
the studio would make it a lot better

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,070
and that's that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the studio</font>

132
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,570
lately though and I actually have a

133
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,669
single coming out so stay tuned<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

134
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,150
well first when I was younger that was

135
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,680
just one of the goals I had set for

136
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,810
myself I really really really wanted to

137
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,810
learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skate handrails so the best</font>

138
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,060
way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is you find a small park</font>

139
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,620
rail they can get comfortable on just

140
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,750
like going down a rail and then just

141
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,900
find a really good seven stair and you

142
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,280
basically just kind of got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go for it</font>

143
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,319
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel as safe and as comfortable as</font>

144
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:48,180
possible and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> stick the trick you</font>

145
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,349
don't want to go to a smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> rail</font>

146
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,599
because honestly like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> forced air is</font>

147
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,069
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot tougher land than the</font>

148
00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:55,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven stairs so go to the park learn it</font>

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your confidence up and</font>

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,819
then when you feel safe doing it on a

151
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:01,889
bigger of real handrail take it there

152
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:05,219
and watching this<font color="#E5E5E5"> on youth every type</font>

153
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,389
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> day before you go out and skate</font>

154
