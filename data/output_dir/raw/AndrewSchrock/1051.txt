1
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,120
that right there was the worst fall that

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could fall on a skateboard</font>

3
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,279
everyone's flipping out in that

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:18,420
statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay because they're like no</font>

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,520
I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much worse okay I wasn't</font>

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was the most painful or most</font>

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,660
injury inducing fall it's not that it's

8
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,099
the worst kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fall it really is</font>

9
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:27,930
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that was the first tried</font>

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,490
down the handrail okay it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

11
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:30,660
warming up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boardslide k he</font>

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,189
wanted to grant her things on the first

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,050
try he did that he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have the</font>

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,160
session that he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning on having</font>

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,660
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that fall I don't know what</font>

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,950
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> his feet weren't having today</font>

17
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,050
because the board kept attacking him he

18
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,280
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't good okay I didn't feel good</font>

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,620
on his body so right then first try he's

20
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,969
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the session I mean he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

21
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:45,899
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk it off and land the trick</font>

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,370
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's just gonna do a boardslide you</font>

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,930
know what that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not how you want to</font>

24
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,940
live your session all right it just

25
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,320
sucks I mean it's like the worst thing

26
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could happen is it falling before</font>

27
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,340
you actually get to try the real tricks

28
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,960
okay it's like being<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good on a</font>

29
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,430
diet and you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like nine days</font>

30
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,570
straight of eating<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and then you</font>

31
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,770
finally like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna eat a good meal</font>

32
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,510
today can you prepare your meal<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

33
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">right oh ho</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you prepare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then</font>

34
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,310
right when it's ready to go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

35
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,930
spend an hour making at you trip and

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:15,390
fall into it and it's not eatable

37
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,740
because it is all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over your face and the</font>

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,909
ground and all that stuff it's like

39
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:19,259
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> really psyched during your prom</font>

40
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:20,490
date and accidentally punching her in

41
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,930
the face before you actually get to kiss

42
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,250
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the night like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had a</font>

43
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,290
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> time with you oops I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> punched</font>

44
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,490
you in the face you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to kiss</font>

45
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,650
me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> goes hey don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so</font>

46
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,750
essentially max Mayberry punches prom

47
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:32,310
date in the face instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of landing you</font>

48
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,479
know a better trick than a board slams

49
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,220
well the moral this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

50
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,720
even that good-looking of a fall I gotta

51
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,460
watch that and be like oh wow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

52
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,290
entertaining to watch it kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

53
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,880
like Max's got dizzy and then tried to

54
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,590
jump on his board and roll and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it didn't</font>

55
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">work you know everybody walking by I</font>

56
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,680
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually see him try the handrail</font>

57
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,399
okay they looked over and they saw this

58
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:51,720
just that and they were like well like a

59
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,700
really sucks a skateboard he is not good

60
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,259
at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just how life works okay</font>

61
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,880
so literally this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the worst fall that</font>

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,840
he could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done nothing productive</font>

63
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,600
from this fall we came except this video

64
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,159
this is the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that came out of</font>

65
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">this fall that is why that's why it</font>

66
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,189
sucks okay so feel bad your heart should

67
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:06,780
be beating for max maybe right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

68
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,910
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> he went there with grand plans</font>

69
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,889
and he just looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a big dumb</font>

70
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,110
guy is it he was a dumb guy on a

71
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,020
skateboard a dizzy skateboard<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not</font>

72
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,850
skating and so yeah kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sucked you</font>

73
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,350
did get hurt he twisted his foot or

74
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,000
ankle or whatever happened I don't know

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,080
because the board really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't give</font>

76
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,550
up on I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like fell and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was like</font>

77
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,569
all right I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk away and the</font>

78
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">board's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm coming with you and</font>

79
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,330
then he laid on the ground for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font>

80
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,900
while and we talked he might have made

81
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,260
fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday that was literally like let</font>

82
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">me get away from my board wasn't a good</font>

83
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">time in any way and your board was like</font>

84
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,440
no wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and he did walk it off</font>

85
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,390
eventually like 20 minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> later he did</font>

86
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,280
the handrail off camera of course so I

87
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,600
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> him do it one more time and here's</font>

88
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,260
that clip but just to prove that max can

89
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,459
do other tricks other than a boardslide

90
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,110
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 stair here are some clips from</font>

91
