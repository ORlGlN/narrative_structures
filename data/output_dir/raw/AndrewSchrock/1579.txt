73
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,239
a little commercially you know against

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,160

75
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,470
awesome escape awesomeness shoving your

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,319

77
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,819
i love the skaters escape in it so i

definitely I want to do a mini US tour

119
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,730
next year but I definitely am open to

120
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,709
the idea of touring internationally to

121
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,359
me I'm like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna freak out because</font>

122
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:52,260
I hate being<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from my family</font>

123
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,049
especially in another country but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you</font>

124
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:56,340
know what I'm gonna man up and do it and

125
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,170
I have a blast doing it so one day I

126
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,120
looked at or international watch out for

127
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,129
me guys Zach says when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were younger</font>

128
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,719
you didn't raise your skating why don't

129
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:04,980
you do that kind of stuff anymore well

130
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,620
first off if I do a crazy trick I'm not

131
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to just put it on YouTube okay I'm</font>

132
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:11,519
gonna put it away<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my video part so</font>

133
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,019
when my video part comes out you'll

134
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,970
probably like you know okay Andy is

135
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,250
doing some some better stuff that we

136
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,829
didn't know about but I am like I'm

137
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,418
older you know I'm in my late 20s and

138
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,970
it's not so easy especially when I only

139
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,680
get like two hours a week<font color="#CCCCCC"> to skate if</font>

140
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,259
I'm lucky so it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to jump</font>

141
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,940
down gaps but I'm definitely work on it

142
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,620
once i can do less of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do so much</font>

143
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,650
video<font color="#E5E5E5"> editing and revive work every day</font>

144
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,810
once i get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with it</font>

145
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,580

146
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,930
able to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and skate more and i'll</font>

147
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,280
probably be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get back into the</font>

148
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,110
swing of bigger things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

149
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,419
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm be saying like 16 stair drops or</font>

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,479

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:29,420
start we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm</font>

203
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,270
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take an approach to the video</font>

204
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,650
how I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it like it's not going</font>

205
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,720
to be just skateboarding it's going to

206
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,980
be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goofy stuff that we get</font>

207
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,080
into and we are avenges and just kind of

208
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,550
funny things so to be a very

209
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,250
light-hearted fun video and I'm already

210
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,660
kind of like getting ideas for the

211
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,000
second video so that one is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

212
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,410
the one we really get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put time and</font>

213
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,300
effort and film it correctly so I'm

214
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,830
really excited to get to work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

215
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,420
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is definitely gonna be</font>

216
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,730

00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,340
good skateboarding in it so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font>

218
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,420

was the last time you went a day without

221
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,910
wearing a red shirt and that was a long

222
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">time here that was 15 years ago actually</font>

223

motivated from movies I get motivator

226
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,030
for music from skate videos when I see

227
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,440
just people how they live their lives

228
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,450
like I take positive things from

229
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,340
everything in my life I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">world think you know like so I just</font>

234
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,950
anything that's really well done and has

235
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,420
some part in it like I get something

236
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">from that sorry to be cheesy but that's</font>

237
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,370
just me Alex asks did you start skating

238
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,930
out of personal interest or to impress

239
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,310
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I started skateboarding</font>

240
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,530
skateboard was not cool I was impressing

241
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,920
nobody I did it out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pure interest for</font>

242
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,220
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity and then I eventually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

243
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,220
to this day I still skate for myself I

244
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,840
feel like if you're trying to skate to

245
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,320
impress people you're doing the wrong

246
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,240
in anything don't do anything to impress

247
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,150
just to impress people do it because you

248
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">care I'm like a motivational like I</font>

249
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,980
should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a motivational speaker for</font>

life<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to turn gay and to search out</font>
