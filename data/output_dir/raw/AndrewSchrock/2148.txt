54
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,439
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to note that it took me over</font>

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,210
two years to hit a thousand subscribers

56
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,850
and five months after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thousand mark</font>

57
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,820
i'm almost at 2,700 so that shows you

two plus years in a thousand and then

60
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,700
within the last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> months i've gotten</font>

61
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,960
about 1700 and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just for me</font>

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,270
like putting my effort in and making new

63
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,459
creative original videos and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just want</font>

64
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:12,720
to point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took youtube a</font>

65
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,920
solid five months

66
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,510
you my application<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you're</font>

67
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,520
aiming for this I mean send it off and

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">then keep doing what you're doing and</font>

69
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,130
just forget about it because you can't

70
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,450
sit around waiting for that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

71

72
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,630
youtube partner here's my advice to you

73
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,790
other than be patient make sure you do

74
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,020
an original content that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

75
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,340
obvious but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know if you're making</font>

76
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,709
stuff that everyone else is putting out

77
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,340
not many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

78
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,440
