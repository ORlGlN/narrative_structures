68
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,119
even care about but like you're gonna

69
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">see me being an idiot in front of the</font>

70
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:07,170
camera it's what is what was what my

71
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,459
words are trying to portray right now

72
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:10,410
he's right man the bunt on a more<font color="#CCCCCC"> bumper</font>

73
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,800
note this thing right here if you

74
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,570
see it this thing sucks I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

75
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,670
what's wrong with my leg I've have a

76
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,870
feeling it might be from like walking

77
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,310
around the hard concrete floor of the

78
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,260
warehouse all day but like I'm freaking

79
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,600
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> older I am not 15 anymore and my</font>

80
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,310
knee hurts like when I skate it feels

81
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,480
kind of funky so I don't know I'm

82
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling yoga or take I don't know I need</font>

83
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,590
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do something I need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest up</font>

84
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,480
stretch do something but my knee kind of

85
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,010
sucks right now which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worries me</font>

86
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,420
cuz I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to California to film so I</font>

87
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,280
don't hopefully I don't hurt it because

88
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,200
you know as skateboarders you like have

89
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's at issue and you don't</font>

90
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,990
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you're like I'm she</font>

91
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,340
could skate anyway and then let's see

92
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,600
what happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> there now that I think</font>

93
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,220
about that's more like a male thing guys

94
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,480
are just stupid like that but uh

95
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,550
hopefully hopefully it's all right I

96
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,130
