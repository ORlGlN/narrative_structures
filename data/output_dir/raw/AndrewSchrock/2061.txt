<font color="#E5E5E5">a confession on one of the biggest</font>

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:32,729
reasons why i make youtube videos i have

16
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,980
sort of had a master plan for my life

17
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,410
these last few years and the youtube

18
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,450
videos have tied into it greatly so you

19
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,860
are about to learn something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me</font>

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,719
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might as well put on your knowledge</font>

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,550
jackets cuz it's about to get cold in

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,160
here gasps why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say some things</font>

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,210
really let's do this so my entire life<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:53,190
have always<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a dreamer even as a</font>

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,079
little kid I wanted to grow up to do

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">something grand with my life and I</font>

27
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:57,780
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up in some job I</font>

28
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,550
didn't care for or live a life that

29
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,320
wasn't affecting anyone essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,699
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a difference in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world</font>

31
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,040
and as I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> older you know late teens</font>

32
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,409
early 20s I started to really see life

33
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,840
you know you get you get screwed over by

34
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,150
people you love you lose friends like

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:14,760
it's not always a fun time and in the

36
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,530
last<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple years especially I have I</font>

37
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,610
just came to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see who I truly am and what</font>

38
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,350
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do with my life like I Know</font>

39
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,240
Who I am and I know what I want to do

40
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,549
and a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that so I</font>

41
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:28,350
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself lucky in that aspect um</font>

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,820
and bear with me I know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

43
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,710
little cheesy but actually it's gonna

44
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,420
continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get cheesy but bear with me</font>

45
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,090
so I simply I'm just gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it I want</font>

46
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,040
to change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world all right and I know</font>

47
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,479
that sounds crazy okay but I don't mean

48
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,950
I'm gonna put on a cape and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly up to a</font>

49
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,689
cliff that has a bus fallen off with a

50
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,549
bunch of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I mean you know I</font>

51
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">totally would save those people I could</font>

52
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you know I can only do what I can do</font>

53
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way I see it is the only way for</font>

54
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,020
me to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world is you know do</font>

55
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,700
all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my projects do exactly what I</font>

56
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,680
want to do with my life to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

57
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,540
have a positive effect on people through

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,100
those projects whether it be

59
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,619
skateboarding and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their skits my book</font>

60
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,439
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not published yet you know and</font>

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,538
lately I have really really really been

62
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,090
wanting to get into acting and I've

63
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,530
probably said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few times much</font>

64
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,830
but uh I really really have<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong urge</font>

65
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,390
you get into acting weathers television

66
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,130
or movies and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pursue it um but</font>

67
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube comes into is I want to use</font>

68
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,170
YouTube as a stepping stone if you may

69
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,989
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to larger projects to reach greater</font>

70
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,300
audiences to have a bigger impact on

71
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this world because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

72
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,220
what where you are in life you can

73
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,260
always turn yourself around return a

74
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,940
situation around and make a better

75
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,069
situation for yourself and be happier

76
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:45,870
and make you know those around you

77
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,750
happier so as is like I said this is

78
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,760
cheesy but that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> why I'm doing</font>

79
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">all this you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

80
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,780
videos as a stepping stone to get

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,489
further into the world and reach bigger

82
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:59,040
audiences and have a greater impact on

83
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,620
people's lives and I know that sounds

84
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a like a something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in like a</font>
