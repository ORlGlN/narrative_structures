I do like is from watching other

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,190
people's footage if sometimes makes me

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,410
realize how weird scape words talk oh

16
00:00:56,149 --> 00:01:00,329
look on pushing smoked on pushing okay

17
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:02,520

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,019
like what how would you explain that

19
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,850
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean I'm smoking on</font>

20
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,650
pushing I don't even know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,090
could mean but your grandpa would

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,409
probably think it has to do something

23
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,090
with drugs that's for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure smoke dope</font>

24
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,950
pushing I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying then there's the</font>

second fall okay which is horrible it's

26
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,850
way worse than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first one the first</font>

27
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,310
was just kind of funny the second one he

28
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,810
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and it's like it's like he</font>

phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

38
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,289
