32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,600
cooler back then when I was a kid we had

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,080
Ninja Turtles we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ghostbusters we had</font>

34
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,759
my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> toys were Dino riders okay</font>

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,200
there was like these dinosaurs that

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,659
these aliens thought that the humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

37
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,979
they had guns shooting each other and

38
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:25,049
it's like oh my gosh I just like it

39
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,240
honestly like even even the late 90s

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,710
when I was like a teenager I still feel

41
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">like things were a lot cooler than now</font>

42
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,009
like now like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem that made</font>

43
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:33,720
toys or like cartoons coming out then

44
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like oh that's a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea you know</font>

45

if anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just keep redoing I'm</font>

46
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,759
redoing all the stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was good when</font>

47
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,229
I was a little dude so I really hope

48
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,909
that the world steps up his game and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

49
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,250
creates cool stuff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know topping the</font>

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,850
kind of wanted to update you guys about

81
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:38,430
my book I'm working more on my book now

82
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,620
than I have in the last two years I'm

<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really good about it I have a</font>

84
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,960
query letter and a quarter letters

85
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,550
basically what you send two agents or

86
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,320
publisher is saying like hey this is who

87
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,700
I am this will have books about are you

88
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,010
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm sending some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

89
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,720
out to agents right now and I'm feeling

90
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,460
good about it so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get a bite back on</font>

91
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,190
that if I get an agent it like I'll tell

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,250
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun how we ecstatic because that</font>

96
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,170
basically raises my chances of getting

my mind published by a legit publisher

98
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,180

separate channel for just like long

166
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,950
stuff I would not change<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything at all</font>

167
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,090
on this channel I would keep this

168
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,710
channel exactly the same but if I do

169
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,810
