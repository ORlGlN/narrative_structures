I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have like a positive effect on</font>

140
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,800
the world so I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm never gonna</font>

feel that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I want to always be</font>

146
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,319
good ongoing thing so I'm always gonna

147
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,819

169
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:25,659
funny enough here's an awesome question

170
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,120
from Doug<font color="#CCCCCC"> desa tells my dude my shred</font>

171
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,919
cast brother he says if you could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

172
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,000
all over again what would you have done

173
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,560
differently and I have would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

174
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,449
harder at the very beginning I would

175
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:36,219
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to do and upload every single</font>

176
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,449
day and that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been really hard</font>

177
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,699
because I worked a lot of jobs back then

178
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,770
but I totally would have worked harder

179
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,930
so to anyone who is trying to like work

the best thing in the world it makes you

210
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,260
better Congress is how often you Jack

212
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,430
recognized in public by people you don't
