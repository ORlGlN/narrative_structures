1
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,340
whoa I did not see that one coming at

2
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,840
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I was the one filming him i</font>

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,820
was first try I had no idea what he's

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,750
trying I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> he wasn't gonna do</font>

5
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,760
nollie flip into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank or something</font>

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,140
or something because he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going a</font>

7
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,550
little slow and I was like Johnny you're

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,320
crazy if you're gonna try flip trick

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,399
right now you're like way too early

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,440
you're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast and then the</font>

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,820
Casper happened I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh I get it</font>

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,320
and it was a surprise because Johnny

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,420
does really good Casper thingies extols

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,040
hello to go home it isn't all the time

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
and usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> lanza or the very least he</font>

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,309
just misses them and doesn't fall

17
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:46,620
rolling down a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rugged bank and I said</font>

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,079
rugged because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground is super rough</font>

19
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and here in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Midwest you</font>

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,870
typically don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smooth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> skate spot</font>

21
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,270
they kind of make concrete to turn into

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,280
cheese graters over the years literally

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,570
like when Johnny was wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> down that</font>

24
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:59,340
Bank it probably felt like he was making

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,719
out with shredder from Ninja Turtles

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever seen anybody make</font>

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,280
out with shredder at all ever no I

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
haven't I definitely have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it hey there's</font>

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,970
a reason why<font color="#CCCCCC"> April O'Neil is on the good</font>

30
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,650

freaking shred you this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting way</font>

32
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,180
too weird but yeah totally surprised me

33
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,799
when Johnny fell down the bank I'm sure

34
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,450
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel good but he you know he</font>

35
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,650
laughed about he had the insights

36
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,970
realized that this was going to be a

37
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">fall</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday it's a full friday right</font>

38
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,150
there ah one thing I didn't notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

39
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,070
i was watching him before<font color="#E5E5E5"> i filmed this</font>

40
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,720
video is that he's making<font color="#E5E5E5"> these weird</font>

41
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,579
noises okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know Johnny does</font>

42
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,229
this all the time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it's</font>

43
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:39,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a ninja grunt okay in fact I don't</font>

44
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,040
know if it sounds ninja<font color="#E5E5E5"> II okay that's</font>

45
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,390
that's the word that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm using right now</font>

46
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,759
but i like to think that was the first

47
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,229
indicate of mine he was like me maybe a

48
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:48,180
swiss ninja maybe swish ninja scrunch or

49
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,960
something to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,070
weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and now it'll start paying</font>

51
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention to Johnny I'm even get a look</font>

52
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,080
at the tricks he doesn't might be like

53
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,430
hey man are you ninja grunting again

54
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,680
yeah you are that's that's weird Johnny

55
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,280
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> go what worries me oh the other thing</font>

56
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of weird that Johnny typically</font>

57
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,920
doesn't fall like I kind of realized

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,450
this I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done one other fall</font>

59
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,100
friday with him and watching him skate I

60
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,510
mean he lands a lot of tricks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok but he</font>

61
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,680
also misses them but he typically

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,540
doesn't fall especially face first on a

63
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,160
bank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know their shoulder first</font>

64
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,290
whatever whatever went first<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok that tip</font>

65
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,610
of it doesn't happen so sitting there

66
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,110
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like wait Johnny what are you</font>

67
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,820
doing dude you're not me that's what I

68
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,980
do I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fall down a bank and I roll</font>

69
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,209
down the bank and be in pain that's

70
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:33,310
totally what I do but Johnny typically

71
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,450
doesn't do it was kind of weird seeing

72
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,190
him it was coming you know kind of made

73
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,959
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like he was a little more human</font>

74
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:39,880
which gave me hope like maybe I can do

75
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,010
that kickflip for my video part public

76
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,390
am probably can't do it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

77
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,040
mindset I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like he should be like</font>

78
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,170
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suckier at taking pain but he</font>

79
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,400
wasn't you know he smiled<font color="#CCCCCC"> and laughed</font>

80
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,989
about and he was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok didn't complain</font>

81
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,670
at all which makes me think he went home

82
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,280
to his diary and wrote about it okay cuz

83
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,660

86
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,890
