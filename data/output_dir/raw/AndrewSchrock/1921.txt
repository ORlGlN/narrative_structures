00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,120
proposal when you have

67

nuts do you like you have no idea and I

95
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,370
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's as bad as people make</font>

96
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,810

sleep tonight if I really try<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

99
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,540
honestly with the times I've been awake

100
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,430
it's because I keep myself up like I'll

101
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,900
get up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bill the night to feed</font>
