15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,250
like I'm even up fall friday then I kept

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,809
watching and I just realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

17
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,489
is a terrible skate session I mean like

18
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:52,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fell like one thing and then you</font>

19
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,520
kicked the cameraman you kicked the

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,020
camera right in the face then there's

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kid then there's the kid that tries</font>

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a good good favor let's call him</font>

23
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,370
Kevin okay we're gonna call this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kid</font>

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:04,589
Kevin after the home alone dude Kevin

25
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:06,270
tries to get Doug's board all right it

26
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:10,920
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not go well at all I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of think</font>

27
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,390
he got hit in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> face I don't because</font>

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board kind of swings I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,450
it didn't happen because I want Kevin to

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,070
have a face I want him<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a perfect</font>

31
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,630
face but he knew another went right

32
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,549
nothing at all went right except Doug

33
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,900
didn't actually get hurt which usually

34
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,939
happens in a fall friday is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

35
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,650
thing that that probably would have made

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense at all this is Doug getting hurt</font>

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:29,579
I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't I hope Kevin's okay</font>

38
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:30,990
in the kid falling I definitely had to

39
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,890
play it<font color="#E5E5E5"> slow mo I didn't really</font>

40
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,299
understood what was going on because the

41
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,860
Cameron kind of flips out completely

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,090
justified do because he probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks</font>

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,320
Doug's got a kick in but if you play it

44
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">in slow mo you can kind of see what's</font>

45
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,680
happening with the kid flying down the

46
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,479
bank not picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the skateboard</font>

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,650
and that is what I saw it look up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

48
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,540
corner of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the frame boom do you see that</font>

49
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's zoom in Doug's face he's smiling</font>

50
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,600
he's absolutely smiling when that kid is

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,220
just falling down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bank what did</font>

52
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,260
Kevin do to doug is the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

53
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,360
what did Kevin do I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kidding Doug</font>

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,470
was probably laugh about something else

55
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,970
or uh I don't know just laughing that he

56
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,380
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> slipping here I didn't you know Doug</font>

57
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,760
did nice dude Doug doesn't laugh at

58
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,710
people in pain so but it's kind of funny

59
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">i freeze from then I was like look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

60
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,350
Doug face right here it's totally in the

61
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,610
corner to like it's like you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

62
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,280
like try to notice that but Doug you

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,930
didn't fool me buddy I saw that I saw

64
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,610
that smile we gotta give props to Doug

65
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,840
because he didn't quit I mean like he

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,640
fell and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then he kicked the camera and</font>

67
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,990
then other people were falling because

68
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,610
of him<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just like he stuck with</font>

69
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,200
it cuz he<font color="#CCCCCC"> landed up to the line he put a</font>

70
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,180
little line together that day but he got

71
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,500
through it was a terrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a</font>

72
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,940
terrible moment that 3-foot kind of

73
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,350
changed the skate park for a second

74
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,750
there and he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so props Doug for</font>

75
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,220
having integrity that is what the moral

76
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,410
this video is today actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I had</font>

77
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,820
no plans of saying that but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

78
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,930
who knows I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and the funny</font>

79
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is is that Doug lands switch three</font>

80
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,810
flips all the time it's kind of weird

81
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that he was missing that switch three</font>

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,570
flip like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I literally have seen him do</font>

83
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,790
it down like<font color="#CCCCCC"> decent sized gaps first try</font>

84
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,440
but either way I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you the</font>

85
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,330
lion Doug landed and some tricks from

86
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,459
his recent trip to shred quarters he

87
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:02,020
destroyed this place last time I was

88
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,510
