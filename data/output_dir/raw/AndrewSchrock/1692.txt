6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,680

i need to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with an intro and that</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,490
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i came up with so that's what i</font>

9
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,230
would like to point out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm alone</font>

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,939
right now and I totally threw that out

11
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:25,500
of frame by myself and it looks pretty

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">legit I'm proud of myself so what does</font>

13
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">my life been like lately that's how I</font>

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,180
normally start these things out right

15
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,860
well I know last week I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like hey</font>

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,420
life is little relaxing because I don't

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,430
have to do revenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wars well uh it's</font>

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,469
actually went on<font color="#E5E5E5"> pause for a second</font>

19
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,690
because it was finals week for my fiance

20
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,129
Brittany and I basically was just a

21
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:46,800
stay-at-home dad like 24 7 for three

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,020
days straight so I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like hey I'm</font>

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,940
hanging<font color="#CCCCCC"> out my little guy and that's it</font>

24
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,649
which is awesome because I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

25
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,239
get that opportunity just to stand home

26
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,190
because I'm working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I mean I</font>

27
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,600
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> see him every day but it was</font>

kinda nice but the same time is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

29
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,449
weird not working for<font color="#E5E5E5"> three days</font>

30
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:01,859
straight but now it's summer and I'm

31
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:03,270
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my normal swing of things and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">now that Brittany and ride in our house</font>

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,600
time for me and I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited for</font>

37
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the warmer weather to hopefully be here</font>

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,439
the same questions to you guys because

45
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,790

46
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,590
completely fine with but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes</font>

47
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,299
to the new name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font>

50
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,880
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the a-ok from the lawyers because</font>

51
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,650
they send me these emails which are

52
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,840
insane like a lawyer email<font color="#E5E5E5"> is written</font>

53
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,820
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lawyer like you know it's like law</font>

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,710
like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good sentence but</font>

57
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,240
wait I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a bad sentence and</font>

58
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,649
then this one right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like makes</font>

59
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:54,659
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like I'm getting adopted I have</font>

60
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,549
no idea but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm gonna get the a ok for</font>

61
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,079
my lawyer and when he says yes you can

62
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,430
announce it it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen and I</font>

63
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,840
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll happen in the beginning of</font>

64
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">next week which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just in a few days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,680
stay tuned I'll have a video and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

66
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,390

now when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to my book I'm still</font>

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,628
just waiting for the cover work I gotta

69
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,250
get the cover work and probably said

70
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,209
this before but I think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

71
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,220
quick process like

72
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,460
gotta put the pieces into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the publishers</font>

73
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,140
templates and then they'll publish it

74
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,940
and sell it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh like I think it's</font>

75
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,710
gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two weeks my book will</font>

77
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,850

79

120
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,110
kind of stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay water I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally saw</font>

121
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:50,299
iron man 3 last night I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a date we</font>

122
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,890
went to some restaurant cook naked

123
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,269
chopsticks we're the only people there

124
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,980
and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of weird but the salad</font>

125
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,239
was good on that matter but like I

126
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,620
walked in there was just like nobody

127
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,150
there it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like five thirty six</font>

128
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,680
o'clock at night like a time that normal

129
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,299
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be eating dinner I feel</font>

130
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not that we ever time</font>

131
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,080
no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but either way the food is</font>

132
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and the important part is that I</font>

133
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,010
saw iron man 3 it was so good it smacked

134
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,630
me in the face it smacked me in the nose

135
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,370
smack to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the gonad just left me in</font>

136
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the foot I don't know it just smacked me</font>

137
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,488
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly kind of thought it was gonna</font>

138
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,350
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a darker movie because the the</font>

139
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,418
trailer had a dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> night vibe to it</font>

140
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:21,738
where I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh man this is going to</font>

141
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:24,650
be some serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but now it totally</font>

142
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,830
is an iron man movie and it

143
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,680
very well done an awesome action story

144
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,689
was great it's better than number two

145
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:32,520
because I feel like number two was like

146
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,560
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit below one so I got to let</font>

147
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">number three sink in but it's definitely</font>

148
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,740
up here with one it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the best</font>

149
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">one might not but one two three boom</font>

150
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,539
