let's get this video started as always

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,170
I'm gonna give you a warning that this

15
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,729
is a talking video so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

16
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:34,350
to sit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and watch me talk don't</font>

17
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,120
want you go text your girlfriend<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">watch me so sit tight and let the</font>

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,450
rambling and goofing off begin actually

23
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking of girlfriends guess who</font>

34
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,200
I broke up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with her is because I was</font>

35

44
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,390
Andy what he what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's sitting here</font>

45
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,619
eating a sandwich for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to be</font>

what you're right especially about the

50
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,579
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and the third one so I was</font>

51
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,960
like all right I threw my sandwich down

52
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,990
and I broke up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> her I'm just kidding</font>

53
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:45,060
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's completely that was a</font>

54
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,890
that was a trick that wasn't real how it

55
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,479
happened at all the real reason is

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,560
personal and I'm not gonna talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

57
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,909
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> on youtube so once you just back</font>

00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that story was a little bit</font>

61
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,009
unnecessary but I'm okay with my breakup

67
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,830
reasons and the reason I'm telling you
