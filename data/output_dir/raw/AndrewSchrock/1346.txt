00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:09,420
Ezeli just likes to live life on the

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,820

00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,259
to that concrete ledge about he about

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:14,610

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,260

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,649
warrior<font color="#E5E5E5"> because he goes out there and he</font>
