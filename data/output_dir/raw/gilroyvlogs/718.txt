<font color="#E5E5E5">that you keep saying keep bitching about</font>

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,430
the fact that you can't gain weight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

32
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,070
yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've noticed different trends over</font>

33
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,039
this past week when we're here with the

34
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:52,390
type of food<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one chase eats um what</font>

35
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,969
I thought lays stax or Pringles or

36
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:57,579
doritos were staple food<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right I</font>

37
00:01:57,579 --> 00:01:59,770
mean they are a staple of America but

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,100
not a staple of building muscle mass or

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,369
anything like that and so yeah I know

40
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,410

61
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:54,739
just gets processed out of your body

62
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:57,260
really fast cuz you know essentially you

63
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,150
need you know building blocks something

64
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,859

right um and<font color="#E5E5E5"> weightlifting exactly wait</font>

72
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,730
so you're gonna tear apart some muscle

73
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,889
tissue I want to tear apart that muscle

74
00:03:21,889 --> 00:03:23,900
tissue you need good food to repair that

75
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,660
muscle tissue so it repairs the next

76
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,519
time you go it's just a hole in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

77

78
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,959
putting it back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> but anyways there's a</font>

79
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,639
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of science behind it and I think we</font>
