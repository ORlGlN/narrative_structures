10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,640
to go through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and pick the</font>

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,199
top 10 cuz they're all really good

12
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">without further ado let's get right to</font>

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,120
it all right first up comes from my

14
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,809
buddy andrew he sent us a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sweet</font>

15
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,230
looking to color illustration this could

16
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">be like the watermark for fan on Friday</font>

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,520
I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's the paintbrush and I</font>

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,200
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cursive lettering that's really</font>

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,969
cool Andrew I like what you've done

20
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,079
looks good next comes from Avery Avery I

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,289
took took the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that I put out there</font>

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,750
and ran with it with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camera lens and</font>

23
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,210
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a gill hawk he put on top its</font>

24
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,729
flames that would suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like Gilroy</font>

25
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,570
blogs is straight on fire right I'll go

26
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so the lens looks really good</font>

27
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,770
I like it the fire looks really good too

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,689
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you've implemented all of</font>

29
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:17,790
these elements together and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

30
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,970
works very well Caleb I thought this was

31
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the most creative submissions he</font>

32
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,610
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> really deep in there and did a</font>

33
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,150
close-up shot of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> camera this is a DSLR</font>

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,850
camera and had lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool little</font>

35
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:36,360
colors coming out of the lens and I

36
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,829
really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the font that you</font>

37
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,350
use fanart Friday starring chase Gilroy

38
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,720
nice touch but no I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

39
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,729
thought that the colors coming out of

40
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,710
the lens was a really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea very</font>

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,350
creative I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that next is from Cody</font>

42
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,189
Cody submitted a pretty simple AG

43
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:55,439
radiated shape blue dark blue to light

44
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,409
blue gilroy fanart Friday silhouette in

45
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,390
my face you can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more simple</font>

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,399
than that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it works it's</font>

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,229
really simple and I think I've stressed

48
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,830
it very very many time

49
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,199
that I like simplicity simplicity is key

50
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,750
what I ultimately want to do is use

51
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,850
these pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of artwork and kind of</font>

52
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,580
dissect them and then animate them so

53
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,280
they they become an intro this I could

54
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,770
see becoming an intro next up and this

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,780
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably one of my favorites our</font>

56
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,750
mirror feds for short for his<font color="#E5E5E5"> last name</font>

57
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,020
a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spacey blue sunburst in the</font>

58
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,210
back they put the winners artworks in

59
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,510
there too which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a nice touch</font>

60
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,610
so I could see this like the the

61
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,530
starburst I could see it rotating in the

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,140
background<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I could see fan art and</font>

63
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,910
Friday flying in it would be really cool

64
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">X comes from Ivan Ivan created kind of a</font>

65
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,360
cool that looks a hand-drawn which is

66
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,550
nice he's actually got a hand in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

67
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,350
drawing it so that further supports the

68
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,910
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a really</font>

69
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:57,850
awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece I can tell you it looks</font>

70
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:00,760
like it looks like you hand drew all of

71
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,950
these elements and then brought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>
