<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so we're going to go to a new</font>

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,880
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know we want it to be 25</font>

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,830
seconds because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already previewed</font>

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,779
the clip broadcast nada 29.97 frames per

5
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:25,830
second that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what we</font>

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,380
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do now is bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the clip that</font>

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use and you just drag it from your</font>

8
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,899
browser into your list of layers want to

9
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,410
fit it now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to trim the clip to</font>

10
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,930
where i'm going to use me because

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,559
Veronica didn't do very well so let's

12
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">just slide this</font>

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,870
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep sliding it</font>

14
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,030
this probably work better if you trim

15
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,640
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clip before you bring it in I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

20
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,230

21
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,560

26
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,540
area so now we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is copy this</font>

27
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:23,470
group so can command g-man G whoops I'm

sorry I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> its command D for</font>

29
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,450
duplicate and now so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> layers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

30
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:34,600
top and just for namesake let's put this

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,410
as freeze oh let me learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spell</font>

32
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,120
real quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so now we need</font>

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,060
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scrub forward to the frame that I</font>

34
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,500
want to freeze and use your forward and

35
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,920
back keys to find the best slipping

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,530
frame like that's the one

37
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:04,120
ah so that's that frame 441 so go to the

38
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">inspector properties go down to timing</font>

39
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,250
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that endpoint is at</font>

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:18,750
441<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you actually want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to select</font>

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:21,850
the actual footage instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the whole</font>

42
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:27,720
group change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the speed to zero and</font>

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,220
change the end condition to hold now

44
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,370
what we'll do is we'll drag this back to

45
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning so it shows up at the very</font>

46
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of our clip now we haven't</font>

47
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,670
mast anything yet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is essentially</font>

48
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to video layers on top of each other so</font>

49
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:56,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I hide the original layer there's</font>

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing below now if you see if I show</font>

51
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,010
the original layer then you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

52
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,660
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just basically two layers on top</font>

53
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,460
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so now what I want</font>

54
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,810
to do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure the play heads at</font>

55
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,380
frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a mask click</font>

56
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,290
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold and get the busy a mask tool</font>

57
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,350
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're going to mask out the</font>

58
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,240
figure where I'm frozen in the air and

59
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,400
going to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of roughly because</font>

60
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,750
it can take take a little bit of time if

61
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,100
you hit command + and then scroll you

62
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,360
can get a closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font>

63
00:04:43,969 --> 00:04:46,339
so just start masking don't go all the

64
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:48,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to the edge because we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

65
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,249
feather it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

66
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:56,799
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of roughly olives</font>

67
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have started good I messed up be</font>

68
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,720
careful not to double-click the points

69
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,780
because then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will close your path and</font>

70
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:13,640
that wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> damask the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path that we walk</font>

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,170
and you can see it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of blurry ah</font>

72
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,380
that's probably because I was in motion

73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,980
I was moving pretty fast and I'm pretty

74
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,260
sure the camera was set to film at 30

75
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,740
frames per second so with quick emotion

76
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,020
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of blur at 30</font>

77
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,850
frames per second I should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

78
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:44,050
changed it to 60

79
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go ahead and do this real</font>

80
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,040
quick and come back to you guys when I'm

81
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,340
finished

82
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,010
I wasn't

83
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:20,959
alright so now that we've went through

84
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,469
and we've added all the points for our

85
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:29,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">mask I pro should do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little area up</font>

86
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:35,209
here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

87
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:38,239
the original clip<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't pass over that</font>

88
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,369
and it's a still shot so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

89
00:06:40,369 --> 00:06:43,179
won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to tell the difference</font>

90
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:47,719
alright so let's fit that to the window

91
00:06:47,719 --> 00:06:55,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">and now if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scrub forward you can see</font>

92
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:59,299
the original clip underneath with my bad

93
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:04,039
acting you can see me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ha let's let that</font>

94
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:06,159
play

95
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">nope alright so now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go back</font>

96
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,250
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point where am i where I line up</font>

97
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,759
to that shot that we froze that frame

98
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,680
that we froze it to so that's it right

99
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,099
there and if you just hit make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure this</font>

100
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:33,669
group is selected hit<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 for the out</font>

101
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:39,060
point and then that layer will disappear

102
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">and one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I wanted to do too is add</font>

103
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:44,349
a feather to that mass so click the math

104
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:48,639
and get your heads up display and let's

105
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:54,460
feather<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a bit let's hide that group</font>

106
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,220
so we can see the effect better

107
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:04,190
alright that looks that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> good right</font>

108
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,820
there I like that

109
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,990
alright so let's show the whole group

110
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,880
and let's play it back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

111
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,210
beginning

112
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,750
yeah yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right one thing I noticed</font>

113
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">too is real quick I want to select this</font>

114
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,950
group and go to drop shadow let's give

115
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,060
it a drop shadow to help add to the

116
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,620
realism let's throw it way out there

117
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:03,560
there we go little blur

118
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,610
so it's really subtle but I think it

119
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:17,830
works well let's watch it again

120
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,880
all right awesome

121
00:09:50,710 --> 00:00:00,000
you
