19
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,750

<font color="#CCCCCC">shoot before we go to Collins</font>

23
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,260
parent-teacher conference so I'm gonna

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to carry my whole set up into the</font>

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,540
garage<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then shoot it when I come</font>

26
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,790
back most likely in the basement because

27
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,650
we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be out of light I don't know it</font>

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">might work but I'm gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

29
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,340
reconfigure my mic because I'm not happy

30
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,200
with the sound so

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,360
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to search everywhere for my</font>

32
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,170
little lapel clip but I've forgot that

33
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,680
it's broken this<font color="#E5E5E5"> little solder came off</font>

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,750
but I also remembered i have this epoxy

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should work if i mix together</font>

36
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,420
little epoxy put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DAB on there it</font>

37
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,510
should put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back together and then</font>

38
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:01,110
I'll be good to go for when i<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back</font>

39
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:07,180
probably way too much mix it dip it in

40
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:16,739
there get it nice and covered and just

41
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:23,610
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it where it goes no no you guys did</font>

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,720
but it's strong enough now to sit there

43
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,420
so i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dry we'll go to</font>
