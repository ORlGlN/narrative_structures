Wednesday look look it is very very

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,839
windy outside and look at those clouds

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:28,570
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool out there I had an</font>

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,040
idea I i got this kite it's windy you

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,100
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only fly kites when it's windy so I</font>

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,989
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can attach a camera to</font>

10
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,260
the kite I don't let's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go find it</font>

11
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,359
so we found a nice big open field this

12
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,640
actually happens to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> baseball</font>

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,420
diamond I will say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's strong enough</font>

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,969
maybe actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too strong see</font>

15
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:53,800
if this works we're gonna take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece</font>

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cardboard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got four holes in it</font>

17
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,629
right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out this was your</font>

18
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:01,449
name Joe Joe suggested we make a

19
00:01:01,449 --> 00:01:03,969
rectangle right opposite the way we're

20
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,860
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to orient the camera so we can</font>

21
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,810
insert this way and then flip<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up like</font>

22
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">this and duct tape it from the back side</font>

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,580
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tape it hard for two we</font>

24
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:21,550
don't want this thing come off this is

25
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,210
totally primitive to this is like

26
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,970
completely last-minute minimal

27
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:34,990
engineering just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wild guesses we're</font>

28
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:38,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fish it through this way</font>

29
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so I've got strange coming from</font>

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">both sides we've got the the camera</font>

31
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,569
mounted on the kite fishing line a

32
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,789
really flimsy cardboard piece that's

33
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:56,850
holding the camera and the will to make

34
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">it work let's see if this this should be</font>

35
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">good</font>

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:57,730
hot you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better method</font>

37
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,090
though because it was very very flimsy

38
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,610
but it worked hmm<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right we got a</font>

39
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,450
live stream to catch dude let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> go we</font>

40
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,209
tied<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with fishing string so it was</font>

41
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:20,100
kind of flimsy and see him he's happy

42
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,060
I'm proud I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool did that was wicked</font>

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,870
cool dude so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it doesn't make</font>

44
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,100
you dizzy you're strong that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean in</font>

45
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,020
theory it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good idea but the</font>

46
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,730
execution left a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little to be desired</font>

47
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,530
we'll have to revisit that but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

48
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,650
it's time to live stream well Veronica's

51
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,410

for a while so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you guys</font>

54
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,019

heart and nice against the best so the

58
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">next step is that you have to go into</font>

59
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,280
the dressing room and pick a costume for

60
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,730

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,930
is going into the dance studio where you

69
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,669
have to learn all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different moves</font>

70
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,650
right so there's six different spots

71
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,240
where you can string together all the

72
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,610
moves and look why don't we see if you

73
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,409
