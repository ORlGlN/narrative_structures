<font color="#E5E5E5">know I found</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be some kind of</font>

231
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">sticks with me was he said he doesn't</font>

232
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any other social media and that's</font>

233
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:02,930
because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> found himself addicted to</font>

234
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,910
Facebook and and he fell<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take away</font>

235
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,420
from his kids which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is so</font>

236
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:12,330
commendable<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I can't say that I'm fully</font>

237
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,610
guilty of neglecting my kids and whatnot

238
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,589
because I when I do social media at work

239
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,630
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all do it we're all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guilty</font>

00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:22,709
and I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like sometimes we should put</font>

241
00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:24,779
our phones down and pay more attention

242
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,240
to our families and the people around<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

243
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,810

254
00:15:03,089 --> 00:15:04,800
point of my story is to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

264
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,990
watch these videos and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if</font>

265
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:34,360
you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even more</font>

266
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,360
incredible to know that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

267
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,420
small as it may seem compared to others

268
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,980
twenty to thirty thousand of you every

lives and their successes and stuff so

274
