65
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,330

66
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,489
you really can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see especially on a</font>

67
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:44,209
little LCD like that focus peaking

68
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:46,530
shines up these bright little lights

69
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,350
when on a subject when it's fully in

70
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,510
focus so even if you can't really<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it</font>

71
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that well the focus peaking shows you</font>

72
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,989
visually that what you need to be in
