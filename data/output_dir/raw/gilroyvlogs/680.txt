easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> if went to lowes or home depot</font>

153
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:35,949
bought new lumber and built this thing

154
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,050
out of all brand-new wood it probably

155
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,399
would have saved a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time and</font>

156
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:43,360
effort but where's the fun in that when

157
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,740
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys want to see me sweat right</font>

158
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,990
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was definitely sweating</font>

159
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,569
pulling apart those two pounds but we're

160
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,310
almost there all we got to do is finish

161
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,009
prepping this this one's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

162
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,709
top surface so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just need to plane it</font>

163
00:09:56,709 --> 00:09:58,350
out

164
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,720
and then we'll probably wrap up this

165
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,760
vlog and start when we actually start

166
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,730
building with a new blog I think it's

167
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,070
gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool when it's all finished</font>

168
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,540
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty rough it's pretty dirty</font>

169
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,990
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is after some planing nice and</font>

170
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,810
smooth we're gonna get these as close to

171
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,200
uniform thickness as possible and I'll

172
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,630
take a belt sander all in blood though

173
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,780

174
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,790

181
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,280
sawdust this table saw that makes

182
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,430
sawdust he took<font color="#E5E5E5"> an old blower right and</font>

183
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,340
