<font color="#CCCCCC">this parking garage literally smack in</font>

4
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,480
the middle of downtown<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shauna my sister</font>

7
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:08,520
today very unfortunate but good that

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,600
she's able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have it taken care of so</font>

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,030
to kill time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this three-hour</font>

10
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,729
procedure I came up here to get some

11
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,060
cool drone shots as you just saw love

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,190
flying the drone around the city there's

13
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing though fair amount of</font>

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,180
interference when you're flying the

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,810
drone in in a downtown city atmosphere

16
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,590
but I think it turned out very

17
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,540
interesting thing just happened I was

18
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,330
walking back to the hospital here and

19
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,540
came across the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> James looking for</font>

20
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">some change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down on his luck and I was</font>

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">telling him the story had a minute to</font>

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,039
chat say what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing in town I</font>

23
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,740
told him my sister a situation I said I

24
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,740
hope she's gonna be okay he said

25
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,619
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that really just hit me</font>

26
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,530
he says man you can't hope you got to

27
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,420
speak it into existence don't hope that

28
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,540
it works believe it'll work and I feel

29
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">like James L was a those are powerful</font>

30
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,350
words<font color="#CCCCCC"> from person and unfortunate</font>

31
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,480
position and people man I just I don't

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what it is about being in the city</font>

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">and interacting with people there's so</font>

34
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,730
much there's so much goodness that you

35
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,790
can gain from just being open hearted

36
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,519
and talking to people I really

37
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,140

believe that you can make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change</font>

42
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,510
and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will happen he said speak it into</font>

43

it it's uncor graft it's not planned

124
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:53,779
like the fact that we've had to deal

125
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:59,180
with my mom's surgery the loss of a

126
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,479
friend's child my sister's surgery all

time is insane but that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

129
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,330
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind like life</font>

130
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,330
doesn't care of the inconveniences that

131
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:19,879
it holds life will take you a thousand

132
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:22,250
different direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you get to</font>

133
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,430
hit up hit that straight away so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just I</font>

134
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,580
guess I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not hold on what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

135
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,789
say is no matter how crazy things

136
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:37,669
how hectic life seems how horrible<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

137
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,710
may feel just know that everything

138
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:42,710
happens for a reason and there's always

139
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:46,010
