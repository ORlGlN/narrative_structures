like hot dogs hot dogs are great but you

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:44,910

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,700

00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,329
nights at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hospital that's quite</font>

18
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,769
appropriate and may I say a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> timing</font>

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,630
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was pretty quick actually</font>

20

21
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,200
Veronica wasn't working nights anymore

22
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,860
so nicely done and I really like the

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,200
representation of really burying that

24
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,060

banner ah let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me first point out that</font>

26
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:30,780
Veronica looks really really sexy with a

27
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,280
sword mmm and for some reason my head is

28
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,909
a lot bigger than it should be but

29
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:41,159
that's fine that's fine i still have a

30
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,829
sword which makes me badass next up we

the spoon so now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to wear this</font>

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,630

Kelsey venray Kelsey I've been waiting

55
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">for someone to do something like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

56
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,639
that if you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> closely um this</font>

57
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,900
entire picture is only the word

58
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,760
gladiators and smile more alternating

59
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,879

00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:20,790
clipping mask which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really cool it's</font>

61
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:23,519
it's kind of like a it's a typography

62
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,989
type of artwork and I like it but Kelsey

63
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,440
