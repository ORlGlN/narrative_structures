damn you can't have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yak about</font>

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,220
that's bad when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ride</font>

26
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,070
your bike stream tricks on these ramps

27
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,680
the smallest bit of moisture will ruin

28
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,979
your day here hold this I gotta pee the

29
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,229
reason we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get towels is because</font>

30
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,510
the skate light in the morning gets

31
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,250
really damp and wet and Kevin would be

32
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,229
visiting an early grave if you try to

33
00:01:23,229 --> 00:01:26,530
ride that walkway so we got everything

34
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">dried off it looks good and Mike</font>

cool we can still be cool together no

54
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,600
worries so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try and get a</font>

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:40,549
mixture of handheld gimbal shots drone

56
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:42,850
shots

57
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,130
and Kevin's Kevin's going to do some

58
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,930
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> very impressive gaps today we</font>

59
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,400
were going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this he does this line</font>

60
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,840
right here where he<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank all</font>

61
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way up and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he gaps that fence</font>

62
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,320
but someone took the fence down on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

63
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,580
section so now it's not cool enough not

64
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,520
hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> core enough I don't think we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

65
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,940
doing that so instead he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do</font>

66
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,590
what he did<font color="#E5E5E5"> before except we've got some</font>

67
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,410
cooler angle with this fly box over here

68
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,970
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there max height test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

69
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:25,750
this quarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so on this quarter</font>

70
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:30,490
we're gonna do a drone shot top down to

71
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,980
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he can come up at the camera but</font>

72
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,000
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we're high</font>

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,920
enough so that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> he reaches his peak</font>

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,470
I don't want to be close to it so it's

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,320
kind of sketchy but that's how I roll

76
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,350

getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really good shots of the</font>

79
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,650
drone uh a lot more difficult tracking

something than just flying around so

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,470
