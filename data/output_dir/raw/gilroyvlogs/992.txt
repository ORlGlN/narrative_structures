hey welcome back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to another edition of</font>

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,000
fanart<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday this week I wanted you</font>

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,120
guys to create a logo design something

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,230
that we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use unlike t-shirts or</font>

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,820
anything anything that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use to</font>

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,320
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand to get where I blogs</font>

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,560
channel and I gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you guys came up</font>

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">with some of the most creative stuff</font>

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,849
that that I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far when you're</font>

10
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,680
thinking about logo design you want to

11
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,529
keep things really clean basic simple of

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,360
course maybe you could draw it out but

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
then it would need to be vectorized and

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">I can definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the difference</font>

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,440
between original artwork and stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,030
was kind of compiled together from

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,710
different images on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet let's</font>

18
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started right away let's start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

the crystal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris sit in it's a</font>

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,090
really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> design and I haven't seen</font>

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,980
anything else like it on any of the

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,340
other submissions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris took the gill</font>

23
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hawk and put it on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the g4</font>

24
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,609
gilroy I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was really</font>

25
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,040
creative and a nice touch so kudos on

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,439
that the handle the sword is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I for</font>

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,930
Gilroy there's a grungy kind of

28
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,450
gladiators text on the blade sword the

29
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:15,299
grungy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tex I'm not crazy about think the</font>

30
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,150
idea behind this design very very strong

31
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,049
good work Chris this one's from Chris

32
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,180
Valenzuela this this is a really strong

33
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,330
design and I like it because it's very

34
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,670
simple the gladder your helmet isn't a

35
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,060
full helmet the lines imply that it's a

36
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,979
helmet I really like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you got some</font>

37
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,320
you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice detail on the plume</font>

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,420
of the top of the helmet and the sword

39
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,720
for the tea the lens for the oh and the

40
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,149
gilroy I really really like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font>

41
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:48,090
it's very very strong the only thing

42
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,899
that I would say is the font for Gilroy

43
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:54,630
gladiators it's kind of too ornamental

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,210
you want to keep it legible so the less

45
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,410
fancy the better you can

46
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,320
next is uh Lucas Lucas made a really

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,620
cool wing logo the only thing that I

48
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,240
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like about this design is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

49
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,600
helmet like the gladiator face<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind</font>

50
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
of evil I'm all about like positivity

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,820
and happiness uplifting and positive

52
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,250
energy so I really like the symmetry of

53
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,400
this design it looks cool so a very good

54
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
job Lucas well done<font color="#CCCCCC"> X up is Lucas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross</font>

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,460
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many double names here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

56
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,190
Lucas Ross made a really cool-looking

57
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:36,800
gladiator helmet it's a good shape I

58
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have something that's easy to</font>

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,070
sketch out if someone were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to draw it</font>

60
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,050
there like a gladiator fan they could

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,720
draw that very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not quite sure</font>

62
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,100
what the fans are behind the helmet but

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,230
if I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks cool and then</font>

64
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,030
gladiator<font color="#E5E5E5"> texel on the bottom that's</font>

65
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,070
really strong design I like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

66
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,310
magma magma made a shield with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helmet</font>

67
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,590
and then Gilbert gladiator on the bottom

68
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,510
I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are coming up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

69
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,060
different helmet ideas the helmet<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

70
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,190
probably going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number one</font>

71
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,130
element in the logo design this one's

72
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,560
really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what it is when</font>

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,390
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if it were all over</font>

74
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,310
everything you would know that's your

75
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,370
gladiator or gladiator or something like

76
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,769
that I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> how simple it is manga did a</font>

77
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,690
good job on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> another helmet design</font>

78
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:26,810
Michael Michael made a really cool look

79
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,510
at spike top helmet I kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

80
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,160
gladiators text on the bottom I like

81
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,680
that it's like AG radiated gold it makes

82
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,720
me think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a medieval type of bomb</font>

83
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,720
it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice the helmet alone I</font>

84
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,850
think like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said before the helmet</font>

85
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,730
alone is a strong element for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

86
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,800
bloodier design so you guys you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

87
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,750
right on track next up a text a

88
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">text-based logo Nathan Bennett built to</font>

89
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:55,730
gilroy gladiators text logo one thing

90
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I really like about this one is</font>

91
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,810
take a look at gladiators you can see

92
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,710
how the sword kind of pin

93
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,900
penetrates the letters in different ways

94
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,330
is kind of weaved in and out I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,840
that's that's creative and I know that

96
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,430
that can be difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it's time</font>

97
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,680
consuming it if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mask out the</font>

98
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,779
proportions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the letter the different</font>

99
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,450
markings inside the letters might be a

100
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,370
little too busy if this were a

101
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">full-color it would look like metal and</font>

102
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,480
that's cool but as it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of</font>

103
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,940
punched out and it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole</font>

104
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,920
lot of sense with all of that fill in

105
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,840
there I really like this one it made<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,880
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 so it's definitely a strong</font>

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,520
design oh my buddy ryan master<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

108
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,710
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could see this on a t-shirt I</font>

109
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,240
don't know maybe it stop me if I'm wrong

110
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,720
but the gill<font color="#CCCCCC"> hawk is a trademark Gilroy</font>

111
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,150
vlogs element and so we have that

112
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,640
represented here in Ryan's design<font color="#E5E5E5"> gilroy</font>

113
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">vlogs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose the text could probably</font>

114
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,010
be dressed up a little bit but the idea

115
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,940
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gill Hawk incorporated into like a</font>

116
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,110
standalone element is a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

117
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,750
like that law next up this is from sep

118
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Torah design this one's clever it's got</font>

119
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so gladiators follows the circular</font>

120
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,890
shape which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assume is a</font>

121
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,490
shield<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we have a gloved hand</font>

122
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,169
holding a sword I can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a</font>

123
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,630
breast placement<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the design it's</font>

124
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,090
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool it can be subtle really nice</font>

125
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:29,919
t-shirt with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right here by the</font>

126
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,860
shoulder this is well done alright the

127
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,960
last one and I'm on I'm on the fence

128
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,790
about this one if it's my favorite one

129
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,540
or not simplicity is key<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a</font>

130
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,910
gladiator helmet and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

131
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,570
basic its basic shapes the proximity

132
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,970
between the shapes is perfect I like

133
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:51,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you you're using basic shapes like</font>

134
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,050
the triangular shapes that go down the

135
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,590
top of the feather I guess you'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

136
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,600
kind of give it detail rather than keep

137
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,480
it a solid shape I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that was</font>

138
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,330
does a great idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then gladiator on</font>

139
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,700
the bottom the only thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

140
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,210
is

141
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,830
it it too closely resembles the Roman

142
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,319
soldier helmet if it weren't for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> my number one choice but I</font>

144
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,970
really appreciate the time that you took

145
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,520
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I think it's time is tennis</font>

146
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,150
tennis<font color="#CCCCCC"> tyn is tennis sorry if I said</font>

147
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">your name wrong there's there's people</font>

148
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,270
from all over the world so you have to

149
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,819
excuse me so yeah so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

150
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,630
and if you if you can recall we have to

151
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:40,650
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> a favorite of all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the submissions</font>

152
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is so tough they're all so good</font>

153
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,070
