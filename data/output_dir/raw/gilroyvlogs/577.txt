00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,480
every bit of six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had the</font>

don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're gonna get and I</font>

143
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it all comes down to like the bed</font>

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,770
frame the bed frame up there we have

145
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,190

147
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:07,010
beginning of beds nine years well so

148
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,160
I've been throwing back the idea of do

149
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,860
we just go buy one that's pre-made has

150
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,020
no you know no character to it at all or

151
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,390
do we make one and I've been like

152
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,570
perusing through Pinterest looking at

153
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,080
different like beds and how you know

154
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,740
like styles and stuff and I think I

155
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,049
don't know I think I kind of wanna try

156
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:36,229
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build my own bed like a platform bed</font>

157
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,240
so a platform bed is one such that

158
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,390
doesn't need box springs so a typical

159
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,390
bed configuration would be mattress box

160
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,690
springs and then your frame but I want

161
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,170
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a platform bed where it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

162
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:56,690
mattress I don't know I kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

163
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,160
build one I'm looking at these that's

164
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,920
kind of a really simplistic bed but I

165
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,780
don't like the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> legs I would like</font>

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,690
some bigger fat

167
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,680
and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like this that are</font>

168
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,480
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just something about that</font>

169
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,580
simplicity that really draws my

170
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,390
attention you know um I like this one

171
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,900

172
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we can compromise me we're gonna</font>

173
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,080
make some kind of simplistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed frame</font>

174
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,210
that has pullout drawers on either side
