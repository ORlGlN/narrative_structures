hi I'm Louie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Co I travel the world and</font>

25
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,900
make videos from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube channel fun</font>

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,750
for Louie and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my adventures I find</font>

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,330
this a lot of obstacles that come<font color="#CCCCCC"> across</font>

28
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,799
what's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest obstacle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

29
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,450
mission that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're on and how did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

30
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,020
overcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

31
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,810
well this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fourth time in space my</font>

32
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,750
second long-duration flight so I kind of

33
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,689
eased into this pretty easily if kind of

34
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:35,539
felt like I had really never left it's

35
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:37,850
really amazing how your body remembers

36
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:41,030
the environment I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think though the</font>

37
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,560
biggest obstacle or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest</font>

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,659
challenge will be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the duration of</font>

39
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:46,969
this flight you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> just being here for</font>

40
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:49,159
so long never being able to leave never

41
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:50,569
being able to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> your place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at work</font>

42
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:53,569
so you know so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been a pretty</font>

43
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:55,459
seamless transition but I you know I

44
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:57,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">expect as I'm here longer it'll be get</font>

45
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,679
more challenging<font color="#E5E5E5"> that regard doing what</font>

46
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:01,939
you're doing staying up on the

47
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:03,860
International Space Station is the

48
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,390
biggest adventure I could imagine and

49
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,429
I'm sure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been for you but if you</font>

50
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:09,378
could travel to anywhere else in space

51
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:12,349
any solar system or planet where would

52
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:19,129
it be no people normally ask you know if

53
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:21,680
you could travel to any other place<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,510
our solar system and then I generally

55
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,329
say Mars but the way you<font color="#CCCCCC"> pose the</font>

56
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:28,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">question I think if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could go anywhere</font>

57
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,950
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably be to a planet that</font>

58
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,180
astronomers and scientists have just

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,840
determined is most like Earth and you

60
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,849
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's really there you know</font>

61
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:43,730
if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are living creatures or you</font>

62
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,489
know just how that planet is evolved and

63
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:48,290
how similar it really is to our home

64
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,859
planet I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard that up in space stray</font>

65
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:54,590
cosmic rays can cause you to see flashes

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,660
of light has that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

67
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:02,060
and if so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look like you</font>

68
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,620
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time I saw those was on</font>

69
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,109
my Hubble Space Telescope mission in

70
00:03:06,109 --> 00:00:00,000
1999
