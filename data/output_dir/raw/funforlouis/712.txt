19
00:00:54,749 --> 00:00:59,489
disease<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of assumptions were</font>

20
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,949
made a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people misconceptions a</font>

21
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:04,290
lot of wrong ideas we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> thrown about</font>

22
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,649
and that confused everybody you don't

deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with people how do you walk how do</font>

26
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,320
you move around how all of those social

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,020
things were totally disrupted completely

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,590
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> was still especially when it hits</font>

29

30
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cope with this it at that time we are</font>

31
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,380
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> safe burial at a time</font>

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,749
people where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will call but then</font>

33
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:35,670
they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> touched the cops would</font>

34
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,259
have done a lot of things by the time

35
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,659
they call and we will not fight prepare

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,929
there were not enough burial teams or<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

37
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">assage to take ops to collect options so</font>

38
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,450
if it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> for more than a day or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

39
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,240
people there are instances where people

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,310
who are brought the copses out of the

41
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,320
homes and put them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way are they</font>

42
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,830
on the footpath which was very scary I

43
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,200
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> here throughout the Civil War I was</font>

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,710
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid as I was for Ebola because</font>

45
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:07,320
for the Civil War I knew where the

46
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">warfront was and I would avoid it but</font>

47
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,640
for Ebola you don't know where they were

48
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,530
from is everybody around you is a

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">suspect it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to you besides as</font>

50
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,120
mistake you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are gone what has been the</font>

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">main things that have helped ever stayed</font>

52
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,520
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped you come back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here and what</font>

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,050
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think needs to continue in order</font>

54
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,540
is very not to come back people we are

55
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,790
resisting calling for safe burial

56
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,250
because of certain traditional issue

57
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,890
certain cultural practices we were able

58
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the religious leaders to</font>

59
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:40,380
perform some religious rights without

60
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,840
going close without talking from a

61
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,239
distance before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coppices second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

62
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,870
week<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was a game changer burials</font>

63
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,300
we are the major source of transmission

64
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,019
and because we were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address it</font>

65
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,420
we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break that area of</font>

66
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,030
problem then that's brought the whole

67
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,519
thing under control could you share some

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:03,750
of the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you think it's</font>

69
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,170
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Ebola crisis well first</font>

70
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,130
of all it has it it has it's a sudden

71
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:15,630
awakening for us to appreciate how bad

72
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,890
our l-system walls so the communities

73
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,280
are more aware now of some of those

74
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,720
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were supposed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,700
that they go up they are now demanding

76
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,260
those things and they want those things

77
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,570
to be there<font color="#CCCCCC"> civilian we don't want to</font>

78
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,239
recover because we don't want to go back

79
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we are before Ebola we want to</font>

80
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,410
transform<font color="#CCCCCC"> our systems to make sure we</font>

81
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,230
can get our steps to the level that can

82
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,110
stand the test of time I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

83
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">sit to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the world first of all I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

84
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,920
say a big thank you to the world for the

85
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">support they gave during the outbreak</font>

86
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,380
and the supports they continue to give

87
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,480
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say that they should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

88
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,850
give up the war is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still on against</font>

89
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:02,060
Ebola and therefore together as a world

90
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,340
we should be together to solve it

91
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,340
therefore I'm asking all those in power

92
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,190
in ethology our world who can offer

93
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,709
support to come around the three

94
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,880
countries say Leone Liberia<font color="#E5E5E5"> keen to see</font>

95
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,060
how they can support them to establish a

96
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,710
system that will transform their health

97
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,710
education social food security wash

98
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,260
systems so that this sort of situation

99
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,230
will never happen again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will be able</font>

100
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,290
stand we will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stand the test</font>

hours from Paris I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get some</font>

158
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">sleep before a big day tomorrow I think</font>

159
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite ambitious of material but</font>

160
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,160
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to summer in the city</font>

162
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,000
it's the third day of it so we've missed

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,710
a couple of days but we thought let's

164
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,350
try making the last day despite probably

165
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,200
getting there with no sleep

166
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,790
but it's been a brilliant trip

167
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,180

168
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,910
