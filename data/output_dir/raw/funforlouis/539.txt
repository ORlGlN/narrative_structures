that's before I was vlogging so you

69
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,110
wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that before I go and</font>

70
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,110
he asked a question last week which was

71
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,669
what your biggest fears and how are you

72
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,449
gonna overcome them so I'm going to

73
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,879
cut to some of your Lance's my biggest

74
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">fear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is getting stuck in one place</font>

75
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,219
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a job um and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to overcome</font>

76
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:02,699
that I'm gonna hopefully save up money

77
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,449
one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> college and then be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

78
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:10,589
myself to hopefully New York or Los

79
00:05:10,589 --> 00:05:13,529
Angeles Seattle something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font>

80
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:16,770
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear is failure and by that I've</font>

81
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:18,300
overcome that you'd be the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> person</font>

82
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,120
and bed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person that was</font>

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,819
yesterday my biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear is of death</font>

84
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,050
and dying but really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not existing</font>

85
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,180
anymore and being forgotten I think

86
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,400
instead of being terrified and trying to

87
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,599
overcome this fear that's just

88
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,469
impossible I think the best thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

89
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:40,379
is to accept it and use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to better</font>

90
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:44,610
yourself my biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> fear is realizing 20</font>

91
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,469
years down the line that I'm not happy

92
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,710
with what I've chosen as a career my

93
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:52,949
plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that not to happen is by doing</font>

94
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:56,449
two things at once so right now I'm

95
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:58,889
handling my family business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at the</font>

96
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,889
same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pursuing photography which</font>

97
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,110
is my passion I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> my only big fear</font>

98
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,149
is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be stuck in a sinking ship in a</font>

99
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:09,060
storm at sea if that makes any sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

100
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">honestly I have no idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to conquer</font>

101
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,459
that fear and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest fear is leaving</font>

102
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,099
my house I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have panic disorder and mild</font>

103
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,849
agoraphobia and my plans to change that

104
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:24,620
this year is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept more invitations</font>

105
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,419
to do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things outside of the home</font>

106
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:30,389
and to say yes more to new adventures I

107
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,120
think my<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest fan has to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the fair</font>

108
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,430
theme known unfortunately the older I

109
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:38,610
get the more I realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> life is one</font>

110
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,039
big unknown you just have to step into

111
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,159
and hope the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest fear in</font>

112
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,770
life is wasting my time doing something

113
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,709
I'm not meant to do or becoming

114
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,050
something I'm not meant to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

115
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,060
overcome this not necessarily because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

116
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,639
practice any sort of religion but I do

117
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,039
believe that everything happens for a

118
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,159
reason and whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the universe wants</font>

119
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:05,129
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do will happen</font>

120
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:06,419
so thanks guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sending in those</font>

121
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,360
answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always enjoy learning a little</font>

122
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,360
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about who you guys are and I've</font>

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,339
realized I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer those questions</font>

124
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,050
myself so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try and answer it</font>

125
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:18,629
like an half answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I think my</font>

126
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:21,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">biggest fear is that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose</font>

127
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:26,489
this amazing part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my life at some</font>

128
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,789
point this ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to share</font>

129
00:07:29,789 --> 00:07:32,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> life</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with you guys and have a</font>

130
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:34,800
relatively successful YouTube channel I

131
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,979
think my fear is that somehow in this

132
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,339
ever compete in YouTube land where I'm

133
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:43,379
competing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> other youtubers for your</font>

134
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:45,360
attention that somehow I'm just gonna

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,409
you know if is allow or and not have

136
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,349
people watch my videos anymore so I

137
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:54,209
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how I'm going to</font>

138
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:56,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">overcome that fear so if you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got any</font>

139
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,999
suggestions let me know but yeah I guess

140
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,529
that is one of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fears and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a a</font>

141
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,339
question I've got for you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>
