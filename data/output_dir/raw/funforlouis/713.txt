51
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,479
cool so the importance of this youth

52
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,449
saving pub is that in these rural areas

53
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,940
they don't have banks right and they

54
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,380
also don't get to all about personal

55
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,860
finance and about saving money so what

56
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,900
this time do is the adults<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font>

57
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,130
these saving groups and they're like

58
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:39,520
mini banks where lots of people put in a

59
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,990
regular amount of money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can</font>

take lines and that group makes interest

61
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,259
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small interest in the lines and so</font>

62
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:50,220
what they've done is<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeled that and</font>

63
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,680
created a child version of it where

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,659

65
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,819

dressed up in the acrobats and the

158
00:13:09,369 --> 00:13:11,920
drumming and stuff it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so cool to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

159
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,600
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the timing just worked out</font>

160
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
amazingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we arrived just as they</font>

161
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,160
lifted the sanctions or they lifted

162
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,740
another level of sanctions literally

163
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,439
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week which meant that they can meet</font>

164
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,009
in public and have markets and have like

165
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:34,300
town gatherings so it was a real fear of

166
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,529
celebration and I guess defeating this

167
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:42,699
as a community and especially after this

168
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:46,209
last year of must have been really hard

169
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:48,009
like not for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the children not</font>

170
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:52,240
going to school and just life not being

171
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,350
what it was and then for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to slowly be</font>

172
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,970
getting back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to normal again it's just</font>

173
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,309
it was incredible to see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> firsthand</font>

174
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:05,769
to be part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yeah one amazing</font>

175
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:08,860
day what a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> time of that we're</font>

176
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,829
actually heading back to London via

177
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:13,660
Paris and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice somewhere else</font>

178
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,149
like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but we're leaving</font>

179
00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:17,589
at lunchtime tomorrow we're going to

180
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,179
hopefully go and check out our market in

181
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:23,379
the morning I'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you then peace out</font>

182
00:14:23,379 --> 00:00:00,000
enjoy life and live the adventure
