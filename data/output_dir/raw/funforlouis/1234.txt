towards staff and you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

of time hanging out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends and</font>

117
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,290
building on friendships but in terms of

118
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,570
achieving things or doing stuff and

119
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:30,540
passionate about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just been</font>

120
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,880
hangout time and it's it's been nice to

121
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,300
rest in some ways but i think i'm at a

122
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,400
phase now where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to be really</font>

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,320
getting in some in my teeth into

124
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,960
something or at least getting an idea of

125
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,790
what what direction I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font>

126
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,530
things at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuz there's so much</font>

127
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">buzzer on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my head there's like I've got</font>

128
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,600
my boss or buses I've actually got two

129
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,370
buses which I could be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font>

130
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,810
probably when i get back from Australia

131
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:59,430
I've got so many ideas but it's all just

132
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,729
bit of you know

133
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,650
a bit foggy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of want to focus</font>

134
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,849
on doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something exciting but</font>

135
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,520
meaningful that's not just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

136
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,949
skating around drinking coffee which is

137
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:14,319
nice but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's doing doing something a</font>

138
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,300
bit more maybe involving you guys all

139
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,999
that kind of stuff and I'm also aware

140
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:24,819
that my life isn't perfect and I do at

141
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,249
times live what can be seen as a bit of

142
00:07:27,249 --> 00:07:29,409
a shallow or indulge in existent well

143
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:31,900
existence where I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> here doing this</font>

144
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,669
thing you know eating out constantly and

145
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,949
and doing whatever I want and I don't

146
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if that's the best way to show you</font>

147
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,979
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to make the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most of life and</font>

148
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:42,999
I'm sure there's other things i'm doing

149
00:07:42,999 --> 00:07:44,860
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're inspiring but I sometimes</font>

150
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like there's more I could do for</font>

151
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:52,300
myself as well just like with my days

152
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,330
