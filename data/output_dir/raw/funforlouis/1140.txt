my dad's no work today so we're trying

39
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think of something fun to do is windy</font>

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,540
outside so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we came up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this plan to</font>

41
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,959
make a kite so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just watching</font>

42
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:23,920
YouTube tutorials at the moment so<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,409
off frame we're just measuring on this

44
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,959
bag to see we can use this is the main

45
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,780
kite fully luckily my dad had some tight

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:43,150
string looking all right I was looking

47
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">up all right so we got the frame down</font>

48
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,079
the string around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the outside now we</font>

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,739
just need to attach

50
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,620
so my dives attached a pretty tale upon

51
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,540
the koi and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out and</font>

52
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">experiment hopefully we can get this</font>

53
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:29,180
flying it's maybe a big failure how

54
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,990
confident you about this dad 5050 I I

55
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,550
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to just twist and do</font>

56
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,680
not knives coupon no it's all about

57
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,020
Justin things and sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like problem</font>

58
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,520
solving we if it doesn't go right first

59
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,500
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> Justin but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know right next time</font>

60
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:18,150
the town is weighing down so i'll take

61
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:36,870
my socks off so now Louie is putting his

62
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,320
wallet in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sock to create an wait</font>

63
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:48,270
well this is 90<font color="#E5E5E5"> well guys but stick an</font>

64
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,010
eye out sure we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to get us out</font>

65
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,840
kite making is hard

66
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,900
I think a combination of the winds dying

67
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,410
and our bad kite making skills then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

68
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,770
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a complete failure but no or</font>

69
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,620

71
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,490
