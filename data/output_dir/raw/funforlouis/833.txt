told you this story before guys but once

126
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,650
i was driving my double decker bus down

127
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,530
this way but it's a one-way system that

128
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,730
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> around to the left and as i was</font>

129
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,260
coming around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with his taxes as a car</font>

130
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,550
parked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the corner so I actually</font>

131
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,380
couldn't get my bus around so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stuck</font>

132
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,450
here for like 20 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

133
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,920
massive cure traffic behind me<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I can</font>

134
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,430
reverse so I ended up driving down this

135
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,830
way which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one-way system you're not</font>

136
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,990
allowed to drive both ways and when I

137
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,970
came around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this corner it was a Bentley</font>

138
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,080
part just there I had to like narrowly

139
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,280
