165
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,530

166
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,970

167
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,700
and I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to film some of it on my</font>

168
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,040
phone but it was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> pitch-black like</font>

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,210
we saw ducks we crashed<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a tree and</font>

175
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:45,720
the motor got clogged up so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was all</font>
