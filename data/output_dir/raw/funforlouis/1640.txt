00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,010
Day 1 of the road trip round the UK in the Boom Bus,

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,520
and I'm feeling pretty excited. Very tired, but pretty excited.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,820
Check out the 'tache.

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,660
Check how long a bus's oil dipstick is.

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,580
Okay, so we filled up, checked the oil, checked the water,

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,120
we're on our way to Brighton.

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:48,980
[music]

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,120
Okay, so it's 5pm,

11
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,140
but I've only been out like 5 hours.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:58,820
Uh...

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,800
and we've arrived in Brighton, and the meet up in the park is now happening.

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,860
Everyone's arrived.

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,200
[Cheering]

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,800
I feel a bit sorry for everyone because it's so dark and rainy outside and uh...

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,920
we've got a nice warm bus.

18
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,060
But we've put some lights on outside,

19
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,020
and uh...

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,580
we've got a few people coming to hang out.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,980
This lovely girl Paige

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:25,820
has, uh, given me this lovely, lovely drink.

23
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,860
"Inside this bottle there is honey,

24
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,560
raspberry squash, apple juice,

25
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,320
fish paste, ketchup, mayonnaise,

26
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,500
double cream, butter...

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,860
That is delicious. Delicious!

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,580
Uh... The, um, the gathering we had was great, um...

29
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,900
Pretty wet and cold.

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,620
So we're celebrating now - having a little, uh,

31
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,160
a little party down in Brighton [pause] here.

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,420
And it's pretty crazy at the bus, come and check this out.

33

[Silence]

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,960
So we've just finished the party.

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,480
Yoda's had a very busy night,

40
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,660
and uh, we're just dropping everyone off at the train station.

41
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,060
[Cheering]

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,720
[Louis laughs]

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,040
This is where Yoda chills when we're driving.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,320
Also acts as a... as a hat, a head warmer.

45
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,520
Gotta get my duvet back out,

46
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,860
turn these, uh, settees back into beds,

47
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,210
and uh...

48
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,140
have a...

49
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,500
a well-deserved rest, I think, after that manic day.

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
But it's been fun, it's been fun.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,820
Um...

52
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,060
Yeah...

53
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,520
Another crazy day tomorrow I guess.

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,580
Um, my hands are covered in oil...

55
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,620
and...

56
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,660
Yoda's just climbed up my leg,

57
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,840
because he's a ninja cat.

58
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,840
Basically,

59
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,360
A ninja Jedi.

60
00:03:18,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Aren't you, Yoda?
