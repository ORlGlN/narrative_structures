18
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:12,420
so just a rise in the middle of nowhere

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,720
near a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little village and the idea today</font>

20
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,299
is basically no I'm looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font>

21
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:19,979
land for Tupac's my playing on a

22
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,710
building Ewok village and Dave's also

23
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:25,140
looking for some land with a lake to

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,299
have a floating house on it was to build

25
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,220
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> wood cabin or something so</font>

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,220
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at options and</font>

27
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,630
obviously planning commission both their

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,610
locations and you know what's possible

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">though he's found this plot of land near</font>

30
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,590
this golf course and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

31
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,680
check out and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it's like I'm</font>

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,500
glad finally there's something in motion

33
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,600
and the fact that Dave's also looking

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,939
for a plot of land could mean that we

35
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,460
end up sharing sharing a an area I want

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,079
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> little patch of woodland though</font>

37
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,360
he can go and live in the lake I can

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,520
have my little tree houses and stuff it

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be pretty fun</font>

40
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it could be a long process but it's</font>

41
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,620
gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> start somewhere the only way I let</font>

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,540
no no running with fish I'm ruining my

43
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:27,740
fun keep trying to drive an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ifr we go</font>

44
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:45,030
cuz that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your late date sold in the</font>

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,470
summer this would be lovely this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

46
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,010
lovely yeah about the rivers make a very

47
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,090
clear boundary as to where the edges<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

48
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,060
OHP footage of a low blow just gonna

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:06,120
catch in case at all yeah yeah what you

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,400
reckon guys should we boy these islands

51
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,130
and the slake my only concern is is not

52
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,170
enough room to be plain on this land and

53
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,730
there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough room for a few</font>

54
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">treehouses but not like an Ewok village</font>

55
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,200
so either this isn't the place or it's

56
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,290
there it's the it's part of the journey

57
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,060
and then we do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> here for a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

58
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,480
maybe build a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of treehouses and</font>

59
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:34,550
give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a go and then we progress to a</font>

60
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,970
bigger plot I'm not convinced I'm not

61
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,590
convinced these<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys seem pretty</font>

62
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:48,360
convinced you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jump in though I</font>

63
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,010
was gonna go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a swim but I get naked</font>

64
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,290
