15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,710
stay tonight is pretty horrific so

16
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,340
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the plans</font>

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,380
I'd quite like to find like just a

18
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,640
mid-level hotel doesn't need to be

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,100
spanked fever the reviews in this hotel

20
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,969
tonight was saying this blaring music of

21
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:32,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">3 a.m. good job and a good job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel booking where new Africa</font>

23
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,909
got some pasta for lunch unlost lunch

24
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:49,170
together as a team I also think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

25
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,509
found a replacement and found a

26
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,939
replacement hotel like that so Nairobi

27
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,429
he's notoriously a bit dangerous a bit

28
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,670
sketchy so that I think this parked our

29
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,520
car inside the cool thing to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,840
safe because it's called our<font color="#E5E5E5"> bag stacked</font>

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,720
on the top check this place out looks

32
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:24,989
like the UN who's that dude yes Bob I

33
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:33,540
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go go we jumped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in some cabs and we</font>

34
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,970
head into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hotel we've cooked a</font>

35
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,980
slightly better one than and Ebert so I

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's right</font>

37
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,870
yeah listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this review the hotel is</font>

38
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,060
located in a dangerous part Nairobi you

39
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,970
cannot go into the street after 6pm I've

40
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,390
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt so threatened I think we</font>

41
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,390
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hotel the first one we tried was</font>

42
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,760
full but it turns out we're not in the

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,250
safest<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of Nairobi but I think</font>

00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,300
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the adventure isn't it</font>
