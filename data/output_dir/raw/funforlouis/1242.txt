working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with this guy jumping on my</font>

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,910
bed I found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good use for this Parkway</font>

5
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,220
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna put a bongo pug</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,390
we're now heading off to the emerald

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,400
creek falls and died the way they look

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:44,590
much better than yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> say so</font>

9
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,670
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the road and</font>

10
00:00:45,670 --> 00:01:12,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to drive through it so</font>

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,400
heading out to emerald creek falls and

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,440
we need to cross this little section of

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,420
river to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and we're just</font>

14
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to decide which is the safest</font>

15
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,650
placed across because it's quite fast

16
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:43,070
flowing water it turns out it's been so

17
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,350
much rainfall that the water levels much

18
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,590
higher and it's flowing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster and</font>

19
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a little bit dangerous actually and</font>

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,979
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are carrying on</font>

21
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,420
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of crossing some of these sections</font>

22
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they just look way too dangerous to</font>

23
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,150
cross

24
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,549
it's also water I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to look for a</font>

25
00:02:06,549 --> 00:02:09,540
way to cross but

26
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,510
yeah go check this out you can just

27
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,330
drink straight in the river with no risk

28
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting anything that was it through</font>

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,050
the straw as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're drinking</font>

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,670
we have to backtrack find a safer place

31
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,909
to cross

32
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,360
so we managed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make over the river we</font>

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,470
now need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to walk up from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fold</font>

34
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,170
through this rocky section and try not

35
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get swept away we got here we've</font>

36
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,890
arrived

37
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,400
well we were hoping we'd be able to swim

38
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,960
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the waterfall but the waters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

39
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,700
flowing too fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't get swept</font>

40
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:39,870
away and died the terrain out here is

41
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,230
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like Australian bush</font>
