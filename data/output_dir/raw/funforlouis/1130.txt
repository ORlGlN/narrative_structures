ideas of how we could be impacting at

154
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,940
the world for the better days like today

155
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,580
are good just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some chilled</font>

156
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,810
conversation time with you one other

157
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,250
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to bring up was</font>

158
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,229
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bugs me a little bit</font>

159
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone commented on one of the videos</font>

160
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,139
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do read your comments guys and I</font>

161
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't often reply mainly because but</font>

162
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:58,419
anyway the comment was that I don't

163
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,210
often reply to comments or tweet so ever

164
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,820
but the treat is I'm always on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the go</font>

165
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:09,699
and rarely have chill time I struggled

166
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:13,660
to reply even to my own friends now I'm

167
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,940
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know back and forth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font>

168
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,669
conversations with I've struggled to get

169
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:20,590
back to people<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I'm always on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

170
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,780
go and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending a few hours a day</font>

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,820
editing and it's often late into the

172
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,849
night and then I'll schedule a video you

173
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:29,410
know upload during the evening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

174
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,849
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have much time we're</font>

175
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:34,240
actually sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down on my computer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

176
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,710
to converse with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys other than now</font>

177
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,200
this is a better format for me to really

178
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,299
interact respond to you guys because I

179
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,400
can read things that I can verbalize my

180
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,600
response a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so it's not</font>

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,790
because i love you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys less it's just</font>

182
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,100
it's it's not a format that works well

183
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,890
with my lifestyle right now but and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

184
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:59,740
there's just thousands of people that do

185
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,840
ask me questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to interact</font>

186
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,150
and I can't respond and interact with

187
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:07,480
all of you so sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know where</font>

188
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,150
to start by I hope you guys understand

189
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,160
