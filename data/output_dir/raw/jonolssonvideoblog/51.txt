1
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,740
I organized so we got the keys a bit early

2
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,720
If you think that I've been a bit weird the last few days

3
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,040
That's because...

4
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,360
I want to ask you something

5
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,260
They say it's better late than never
- Yes, haha

6
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,760
Thanks for being so patient with me

7
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,040
Will you marry me?

8
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,920
Of course I want!

9
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,420
Are you sure?
- Yes!

10
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,300
Your dad asked me

11
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,360
Are you buying the ring before she said yes

12
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
Of course I was going to say yes

13
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,360
I've been laughing inside when we've been talking about it

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,320
How long did you plan this?

15
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,860
You know me

16
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,820
Wow you made it so pretty here

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,300
WOW!

18
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
How do you know my size? Do you know it?

19
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,960
Sorry for not crying but I'm shaking inside

20
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,380
At least my shirt says I love you, haha

21
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,980
Are we getting married now?

22
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,820
Yes, I though so
That was what I was hoping for

23
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,120
You're the best

24
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,500
So when are we getting married?

25
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
As soon as possible!

26
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,400
And now you say there's one more surprise
- Yes, let's do it all at once

27
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,600
I've never been that nervous

28
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,260
Noo, I haven't noticed that much
- I haven't been able to eat all day

29
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,080
I haven't noticed anything

30
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,840
You're not the one who gets nervous

31
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:40,260
This was a bit bigger than everything

32
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,660
I've always known that I don't want to live with anyone else than you

33
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,440
And I've been thinking a million thoughts about what to say to you

34
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,060
But I think I will have to tell you that later

35
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,820
Should we sit down?

36
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,460
What an incredible ring, love!

37
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,860
It's not easy with rings

38
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
It's amazing!

39
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
I thought it was pretty

40
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,640
I'm so happy you said yes
- But what did you think?

41
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,640
You couldn't have thought anything else

42
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,280
It was like your dad said, you never know with Janni

43
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,220
It's the only thing I've been able to think about for a month

44
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,380
There's no other girl in the world that can come close to you

45
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Do you want to take a photo?

46
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,800
I would love to!
- It would be fun to have a photo

47
00:06:16,060 --> 00:00:00,000
Do we have anyone here in the house? 
- Yes
- What, really?
