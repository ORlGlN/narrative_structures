1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,040
Okay are you there?

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:02,260
Yeah I'm here.

3
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:03,660
Okay guess what.

4
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,600
What?

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,480
Wait is the guy for the railing supposed to come tomorrow?

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:08,980
Saturday, yes.

7
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,420
What's he doing today cause I really need him today? ;)

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,320
I wanna get the mattress out of the garage

9
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,900
i wanna make the foam pit soft again

10
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,080
since we had to take those other mattresses out.

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,160
and uhhhh...

12
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,040
and i wanna do the 24 hour foam pit challenge since it's a Friday.

13
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,740
and Dylan and Quentin and them aren't gonna have school.

14
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,460
But i really want the railing out because then we can do

15
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,260
like standing double backflips and do like really good tricks

16
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,560
and actually have fun and not be bored for 24 hours.

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,940
So it'd be amazing if we could get like the railing taken out today.

18
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,200
Well even if he couldn't build it all and put it back together maybe he could at least take the pieces out so it would have an opening.

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:40,820
Yes. Awesome.

20
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,620
Thank you.

21
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,120
What is going on guys?

22
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,440
Today we are back and today...

23
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,380
Hold on lemme make sure this freakin microphone's on.

24
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,220
I think it is.

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,240
Okay still getting used to this new microphone.

26
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,940
But it's 11am right now.

27
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,100
Just watched some Netflix and edited my video.

28
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,460
My manager Max is still here, and a guy named Zack.

29
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,260
He owns a big clothing company and we've been talking to him about doing stuff.

30
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,320
I'll introduce you guys to them in a second, but yeah!

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,680
As you guys heard with me on the phone we're going to be doing the 24 hour foam pit challenge today.

32
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:07,220
I think, hopefully we can get that railing taken out, maybe even the fan today.

33
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,640
Not sure about the ceiling fan.

34
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,260
But that thing's not really in the way that much anymore,

35
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,700
'Cause we took out some of the blades.

36
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,820
I think Dylan is still grounded for something,

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,660
but Quentin can definitely be in this video.

38
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,080
Maybe we'll get someone else

39
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,580
I'm not sure yet

40
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,080
but i'm just super hype

41
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,660
and i wanna do another video in the foam pit

42
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,660
if you guys follow me on twitter i told you guys i'm gonna start going hard on youtube again like

43
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,780
i'm gonna be grinding ok i'm gonna be coming up with great video ideas

44
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,680
i already have so many video ideas for this summer

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,520
just have to wait for it to get a little bit warmer, have my friends get out school completely,

46
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,620
and it's gonna be insane! You guys remember last time, where we did so much fun stuff?

47
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:39,760
It's gonna be just like that. So, yeah I'm gonna go and take a shower in my weird shower. I'm gonna get ready, then we'll head upstairs and i'll see you guys in a minute so

48
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,300
Good morning! Thank you

49
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,780
So, that's Max, sitting in the chair - he's my manager - and then that's Zach behind him, clothing guy I talked about.

50
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,100
and my mom just brought me some Dairy Queen and we're waiting for Dylan to get here - What?

51
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,180
-Best mom ever.

52
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,380
-Yeah. (laughs)

53
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,460
We'll probably go to Walmart and get a bunch of snacks for this challenge as well,.

54
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,360
And then the guy's gonna come take out the railing in a few hours.

55
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,740
So, everything will be ready to go and I don't know if it's actually gonna be a 24 hour challenge because

56
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:08,560
In order for me to upload my video on time, it's gonna be like 23 hours and I'm gonna have to edit in the foam pit somehow

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,500
It's gonna be fun.

58
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,520
Alright, we're heading out to the trampoline right now. We'll see if Zach can still do a backflip

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,900
This trampoline is kind of wobbly because it's on like, halfway on the concrete, but it should stay still.

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
I'll try to hold it down.

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,480
(chuckles) Alright, you ready?

62
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,160
-Yeah.

63
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,080
-Alright.

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,100
(laughs)

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,720
Told you.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Did it, though.

67
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,020
Almost!

68
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,320
Yeah, it's slides all over the place right now.

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,180
Alright, so we're playing GTA!

70
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,160
Quentin is here, don't know if Dylan's coming. If he does, it'll be, uh, a little while.

71
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,080
We're about to go ahead and go to Walmart so we can get snacks for this overnight challenge.

72
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,120
And I'm putting on my Heely's for the first time since Philadelphia.

73
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,280
Haven't worn them. Haven't had a reason, really. And Zach and Max are coming with us.

74
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,580
Come on out, Quentin!

75
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,300
Alright, I don't know what to get, you help me decide.

76
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Chips first. We're hitting up chip aisle first.

77
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,260
wannna buy some chips as i am hungry

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,080
Oh, we got these last time! These are good. My grandma used to get these.

79
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,660
Where's the off brand? There they are. These are the better ones.

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,540
-Are they really?
-Yeah, I swear they're good.

81
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,160
Go long! Here, I'll go long.

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,700
Yeah!

83
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,980
Now, where the frick are the Chips Ahoy? I swear, they should be here.

84
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,440
(gasps) The cookie aisle.

85
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,520
S'mores? What? Are you kidding me?

86
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,460
-Yes?
-I've never had these before.

87
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,120
Oh, the mint ones are so good.

88
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,880
Y'know what, we're gonna...just...

89
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,840
To the checkout.

90
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,400
Hey! Don't crash us.

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
I'll race you!

92
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,820
No, he's gonna win!

93
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,820
Nooooo! (chuckles)

94
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,380
Does my trunk have fan mail? Moment of truth.

95
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,380
It shouldn't.

96
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,840
Uh, yeah. It definitely does.

97
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,900
-Uh, it'll fit.
-Ah, crap.

98
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:52,740
We got our snacks by the foam pit. Quentin and I are about to go get the mattress out of the shed. No no no, not shed

99
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,460
-Garage?
-Out of the second garage, yeah. It's on the floor.

100
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,040
And then we're gonna put it into the foam pit, right behind the bean bag in the middle.

101
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,740
We're gonna fluff the foam, put the pillows back on top, make it soft again so we can actually do some good stuff.

102
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,240
Heh heh heh. I have your camera.

103
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,320
Alright guys, it is 2:44 (WHAT!) p.m. right now. Oh, god almost died. Alright, we're in the foam pit right now.

104
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:12,580
We're gonna move this over so we can put that mattress in the middle like I already said, like 40 times. And uh

105
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,420
I think we have another mattress downstairs. We're gonna get softer and then the railing's coming out.

106
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,160
We're not making it a swinging gate today, we're just getting rid of it so we can do flips off it.

107
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,820
We're gonna make it a gate tomorrow, and then I think the fan comes out tomorrow too.

108
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,780
Perfect.

109
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,000
And the blanket. We're putting a blanket over this time so all the pillows don't fall into the foam and then get lost.

110
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,440
Heh, it looks like there's a little point.

111
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,580
And then, maybe triple front? I don't know, you ask me that later.

112
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Let me get a few Chips Ahoy cookies in there and we'll decide.

113
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,100
Look at that mountain. This should be soft.

114
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,560
Come on in.

115
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,460
I just realized, like, once the balcony is gone, they can just jump off into the foam pit if the wanted to.

116
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,400
Oh, that was amazing. I bounced!

117
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,880
-Why'd you do that?
-I don't know. I just did.

118
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,140
-If you jumped, she would definitely follow you.
-I know. She follows me everywhere. Watch.

119
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,560
-I'll run. She'll follow me.
-Where'd you go?

120
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,480
She actually found me! (laughs) You're so good at hide and seek.

121
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,300
Oh, and Dylan's on his way. by the way.

122
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,440
So, he actually is gonna show up.

123
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,400
guys we  just got a package, at our front door from the people who do our merchandise.

124
00:05:08,400 --> 00:00:00,000
I got to get down real quick
