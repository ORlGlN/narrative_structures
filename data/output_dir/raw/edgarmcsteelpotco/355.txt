we've been inside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot we got like</font>

84
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,620
all of our rooms and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's set up</font>

85
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,420
we were under contract with it and

86
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,650
whenever you buy a house you have to

87
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,480
have it inspected so we had a guy come

88
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,250
and inspect it like a day ago and then I

89
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,720
asked my mom how the inspection go<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

90
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">text her and then my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mom called me and</font>

91
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,470
she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like don't freak out but there's</font>

92
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,030
too many problems with the house that we

93
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,350
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I can</font>

94
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">legally say was wrong with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it but we'd</font>

95
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,980
also have to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a fence security</font>

96
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,420
stuff and a lot more stuff so we

97
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,130
cancelled the contract and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

98

103
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,209

251
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:20,059
house I told the guy was not very

252
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">inspection didn't goo boo yeah like it</font>

00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:26,279
house obviously it would look<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stephen</font>

255
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:29,279
got like it I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> poop put my feet up</font>

256
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,989
here I don't want to do like fight if

257
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:33,779
this was mine what I did it's crazy I'd

258
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,159
have to fill the stuff with some cool

259
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,659
let's go look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pool I haven't</font>

260
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,129
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the pool from the outside as</font>

261
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:39,808
cool as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on the inside whenever we</font>

262
00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:41,009
drove up I literally thought that was

263
00:08:41,009 --> 00:08:42,509
like a maintenance room for the pool

264
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,159
yeah I've a feeling no trampolines are

265
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,779
gonna be able to fit in here I be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

266
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fit it under here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

267
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,809
the front half of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> champ we have</font>

268
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:50,430
probably you can jump off of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto</font>

269
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,930
it and said jumping onto the roof true

270
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,029
except this pool super skinny I'd die

271
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:55,379
till we go to the barn I guess it looks

272
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:57,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right just I think it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> color it</font>

273
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,040
needs to look wooden like on the outside

274
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,809
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just cuz it's so flat in</font>

275
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,430
the front yeah let's find out we get
