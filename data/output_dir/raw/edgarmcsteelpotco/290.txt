really hard to get that back on the wall

174
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,930
in the video of us jumping off the

175
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,370
balcony onto the beanbags i said my

176
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,169

baby blanket that belongs to me

179
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:12,509
ok it's actually my sister's but it

180
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:14,340
belongs to me because it's rainbow and i

182
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,310
going to leave this on the beanbag just

183
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,320
