super good and if you are one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

65

people that made it sexual in your head

somehow you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the problem there are a</font>

67
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,870
lot of potential meanings in this video

68

all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them very deep and philosophical</font>

69

if you're one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the many people that's</font>

already seen this<font color="#E5E5E5"> video you likely</font>

71
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,260
already thought through what you think

72
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,940
it means I've taken it upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> myself to</font>

73
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,770
create a very short list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a few things</font>

74
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,570
that you as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> viewer could take away</font>

75
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,110
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> video that are not in any way</font>

76
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,220
artistic maybe there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> woman's</font>

77
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,510
clothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> sale going on in the other</font>

83
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,250

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,050
over who has to do the laundry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that week</font>

85
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,060
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new horror movie trailer that</font>

86
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,040
has been blowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up social media which</font>

87
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,690
makes sense because it is called

88
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:25,750
unfriended it's literally the worst fate

89
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,370
imaginable the trailer supposedly

90
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,710
instills a deep fear within you like

91
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,270
watching a youtuber you like do the

92
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:34,330
