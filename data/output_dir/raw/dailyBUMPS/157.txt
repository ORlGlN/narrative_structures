00:00:06,342 --> 00:00:08,186
Say, "You got it daddy! Get it, get it!"

6
00:00:08,186 --> 00:00:09,752

00:00:09,752 --> 00:00:10,942
We are family.

- We are a tribe!

11
00:00:14,898 --> 00:00:17,727
So Jack is gonna watch us
now, play our little game.

12
00:00:17,727 --> 00:00:21,426
We have a special game we've
been saving for the boys

13
00:00:21,426 --> 00:00:23,238
for Halloween time.

14
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:24,089

- Good morning!

27
00:00:53,031 --> 00:00:54,680
- We are getting breakfast this morning,

28
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,415
and the whole restaurant is
decked out in Halloween stuff.

29
00:00:58,415 --> 00:01:01,407
(Oliver yells)

30
00:01:01,407 --> 00:01:02,965
Whoa, it does?

31
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,066
- [Missy] Can you see it from there?

32
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,800
- [Bryan] Yeah, they have
these really freaky pictures

33
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,217
that are like changing faces,

34
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,880
and the boys are freaking out
- Kind of scary.

35
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,544
- [Bryan] Yeah, what do
you think about that Ollie?

36
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:15,368
- I'm not scared of anything.

37
00:01:15,368 --> 00:01:16,206
- You're not?

38
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,318
I would say that, yes, Ollie is not afraid

39
00:01:18,318 --> 00:01:21,695
of a lot of things, but
food is one of them.

40
00:01:21,695 --> 00:01:22,844
- Yeah, for sure.

41
00:01:22,844 --> 00:01:24,057
- It's almost like every time we go

42
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:25,123
to a restaurant it's like going to a

43
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,088
haunted maze.
- I'm not hungry.

44
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:26,921
- Yeah, "I'm not hungry.

45
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,087
"Nope, I don't need to go in there.

46
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:28,920
"No it's okay."

47
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,283
I'm like, "It's not a
haunted house, buddy."

48
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,374
(Missy laughs)

49
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,856
- [Bryan] Finn, are you stacking?

50
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:33,689
- Yeah.

51
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,522
- [Bryan] Here, keep stacking.

52
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:35,799
- Here Finn, I will help you stack.

53
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:38,270
- [Bryan] Yeah, Ollie will help you.

54
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,531
- [Missy] Can we get a couple ...

55
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:41,638
(groaning)

56
00:01:41,638 --> 00:01:44,221
(upbeat music)

57
00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,546
(Bryan laughs)

58
00:01:56,546 --> 00:01:58,407
- [Bryan] That's a cool pumpkin huh?

59
00:01:58,407 --> 00:01:59,240
- Yeah.

60
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,241
- [Bryan] Yeah, are you
excited to carve your pumpkin?

61
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:02,123
- Yeah.

62
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,771
- We just had an amazing
breakfast and now we are

63
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:07,936
actually gonna drop Finley
off at Mimi and Papa's.

64
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,570
And we are gonna do
some fun rock climbing.

65
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:12,185
(upbeat music)

66
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:14,960
Alright, we are now at the rock gym doing

67
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,644
some rock climbing, and
Ollie is joining us.

68
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:20,283
This is the little kid area.

69
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,268
We're kinda bummed cause he can't

70
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:22,388
do a harness and climb up.

71
00:02:22,388 --> 00:02:23,638
That's so cool.

72
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:25,966
Whoa!

73
00:02:25,966 --> 00:02:28,370
- Was like a superhero.

74
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,458
- Ollie, dude you're like a superhero.

75
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:34,853
- [Missy] Okay now do it but
only touch the yellow ones.

76
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:36,109
Only use the yellow ones.

77
00:02:36,109 --> 00:02:38,138
- [Bryan] Oh, its a good
color learning exercise.

78
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:40,856
Like, learn colors while rock climbing.

79
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:42,111
Only yellow, Ollie!

80
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:42,944
There you go.

81
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:45,527
(upbeat music)

82
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:49,279
He is such a cool kid.

83
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,525
He just has so much determination.

84
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:53,313
Can the people who own this gym just see

85
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:55,210
that our son is four years old

86
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,707
and this is not good enough for him.

87
00:02:56,707 --> 00:02:58,848
He has to wait two years
before he can climb on these.

88
00:02:58,848 --> 00:03:00,374
- I know, there's some really easy walls.

89
00:03:00,374 --> 00:03:01,275
- [Bryan] Oh, I know.

90
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,280
- You know what though?

91
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,401
I think I know what the problem is.

92
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,567
When we were at the other place,

93
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,346
when he went to jump,
it didn't even go down.

94
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,404
- [Bryan] Oh yeah.

95
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,237
(laughs)

96
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:10,472
- We basically had to pull him down.

97
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,801
- [Bryan] Yeah, 'cause
he doesn't weigh enough.

98
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,444
I love all the little
letters and stuff too.

99
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:16,027
(upbeat music)

100
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,224
Whoa!

101
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:22,667
- [Missy] God, that's scary.

102
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,203
- You're crazy, kiddo.

103
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,545
All right, we are gonna get,

104
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:28,388
I'm trying to see if I can
do a couple of runs here.

105
00:03:28,388 --> 00:03:31,148
I don't really rock climb, so.

106
00:03:31,148 --> 00:03:32,008
- It's hard the first time.

107
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,030
You really have to, I don't know.

108
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,454
Even one run will just
make your arms cramp.

109
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:37,430
- Yeah (laughs).

110
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,719
I'm excited though to get up there.

111
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:40,144
I did a little bit and then my heart

112
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:41,076
started beating really fast,

113
00:03:41,076 --> 00:03:42,016
'cause I was getting really high

114
00:03:42,016 --> 00:03:43,674
I was like, "Oh, I think
I'm afraid of heights."

115
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:44,866
- Yeah it's scary at first.

116
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:46,445
Especially when you have to jump.

117
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:47,751
- [Bryan] Yeah (laughs).

118
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:49,267
Look at this kid.

119
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,850
(upbeat music)

120
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:57,501
- Bryan's about to do his very first run.

121
00:04:00,427 --> 00:04:02,422
- I can probably go all
the way up physically,

122
00:04:02,422 --> 00:04:04,308
but mentally, I don't know if I can.

123
00:04:04,308 --> 00:04:05,141
- [Missy] I know.

124
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,163
- Might be jumping off right there.

125
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,892
- [Missy] No, you can
do it, you can do it.

126
00:04:08,892 --> 00:04:10,504
(Ollie murmuring)

127
00:04:10,504 --> 00:04:12,222
- [Missy] Yeah?

128
00:04:12,222 --> 00:04:13,071
Here goes daddy.

129
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:14,221
Say, "You got it daddy!

130
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,191
"Get it, get it!"

131

184
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:52,490
(laughs)

185
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,771
She's looking at shoes for some costumes

186
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,217
she's gotta wear this month.

187
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:58,748
We actually have a 1920s themed party

188
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:00,823
we're going to tomorrow night also.

189
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,037
So I had to get a couple of things at H&M

190
00:06:03,037 --> 00:06:07,233
like hats and jackets, and
we gotta go find a vest

191
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,229
and stuff for me also
so that I look the part.

192
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:11,095
So we've been trying to get
some shopping done at the mall,

193
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:13,373
and the boys are just beyond bored.

194
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,406
What are you guys doing?

195
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:18,084
(laughing)

196
00:06:18,084 --> 00:06:19,593
Are you bored?

197
00:06:19,593 --> 00:06:21,305
Tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle tickle!

198
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:22,959
- Alright, we just got home.

199
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,893
We have had a crazy day.

200
00:06:24,893 --> 00:06:25,932
We've been shopping.

201
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:26,765
We have--

202
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,130
- I told Missy I closed
all my activity rings

203
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,976
on my Apple watch just shopping today.

204
00:06:29,976 --> 00:06:31,636
- We're exhausted!

205
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:32,871
But we really were trying to catch up

206
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,049
on a few things that we needed

207
00:06:34,049 --> 00:06:36,709
because we have some fun upcoming parties

208
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:37,853
and things like that.

209
00:06:37,853 --> 00:06:39,002
I am super blue right now

210
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,330
because I'm standing in
front of the fish tank!

211
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:45,306
And we are feeding our fish
right now, and they are happy.

212
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:46,804
Look at him!

213
00:06:46,804 --> 00:06:47,977
Should we name him?

214
00:06:47,977 --> 00:06:50,264
- [Bryan] Should we name him?

215
00:06:50,264 --> 00:06:51,547
- [Missy] Look at our tank is green,

216
00:06:51,547 --> 00:06:53,143
and that's what it's supposed to be.

217
00:06:53,143 --> 00:06:55,387
- Yeah, it means that
it's cycling really good.

218
00:06:55,387 --> 00:06:56,717
And actually I get to scrape it all off,

219
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,350
and they eat it all and they love it.

220
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,183
- So neat.

221
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,748
You can see it over there.

222
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:02,605
That's so neat.

223
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:05,024
Look at, even Kai's coming out!

224
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,040
We had the other day, we
asked you guys for ideas

225
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,260
on what we should name this
big fish guy that we got.

226
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,194
He's really, really cool.

227
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,353
So if you can't tell
he got tons of colors.

228
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:17,432
He's got blue, orange, yellow.
- Look at, he's coming out.

229
00:07:17,432 --> 00:07:18,415
He's like, "Oh hey!"

230
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:19,273
- Black.

231
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,172
He's really cool-looking.

232
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,937
And a few people left the comment

233
00:07:21,937 --> 00:07:24,445
that they think we should name him Rafiki.

234
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:27,392
- So! We were thinking of
letting you guys decide

235
00:07:27,392 --> 00:07:30,238
if we should name him Rafiki or Dude.

236
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:32,270
'Cause I literally just
call him Dude all the time,

237
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,684
and I feel that he responds to it now.

238
00:07:33,684 --> 00:07:36,275
- [Missy] He's a very
surfer dude looking guy.

239
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:39,310
- So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna do an iCard poll,

240
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,795
which we've never done
on this channel yet.

241
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,484
So, when you're watching this video,

242
00:07:42,484 --> 00:07:43,845
click the iCard in the corner,

243
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:45,051
and there should be a little poll there.

244
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:46,666
And you can choose whether you think

245
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,087
we should name him Rafiki or Dude.

246
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:51,587
- [Missy] 'Kay! Are you Rafiki or Dude?

247
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:52,994
What's your name?

248
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,741
(laughs)

249
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,368
Look at that! Getting all clean!

250
00:07:57,368 --> 00:08:00,201
(whimsical music)

251
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:12,771
- I'm Jack!

252
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,354
(Bryan laughs)

253
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,292
- Hey Ollie, who's on the pumpkin?

254
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:21,266
- Jack Skellington!

255
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,099
- [Bryan] That's right!

256
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,923
We got our Jack Skellington
pumpkin complete!

257
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:27,744
Finn's favorite word
is Halloween right now.

258
00:08:27,744 --> 00:08:28,577
Right?

259
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:29,410
- Oh yeah.

260
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,930
- Yeah, so now that Jack
Skellington is complete,

261
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,066
which by the way, buying a white pumpkin

262
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:37,399
was way better than painting one, right?

263
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:39,244
- Oh yeah.

264
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:41,090
- Yeah, so Jack is gonna watch us now

265
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,238
play our little game.

266
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:45,118
We have a special game we've been saving

267
00:08:45,118 --> 00:08:47,614
for the boys for Halloween time.

268
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:48,840
I'm a leave Jack right there.

269
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,809
He's got a good view.

270
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:50,930
Alright boys!

271
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,833
The name of the game is

272
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:56,867
Operation Nightmare
Before Christmas Edition!

273
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,654
We've got your bad guy Oogie Boogie here,

274
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:02,058
and inside of him are all of these bugs.

275
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,137
No, don't touch, don't touch!

276
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:07,077
We're playing Operation, so
you're gonna draw a card.

277
00:09:07,077 --> 00:09:08,993
It's gonna tell you which one to grab,

278
00:09:08,993 --> 00:09:10,439
and then you gotta grab it out of here.

279
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:14,579
And if you touch the sides
Ollie, you get shocked.

280
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,894
- All right, the first
person who gets to go first

281
00:09:17,894 --> 00:09:21,445
is the biggest Nightmare
Before Christmas fan.

282
00:09:21,445 --> 00:09:22,996
Who's the biggest Nightmare
Before Christmas fan?

283
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,970
- Whose the biggest fan in the house?

284
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,257
- I kinda think it's Ollie!

285
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:28,871
Do you love The Nightmare Before
Christmas more than daddy?

286
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:29,704
Yeah?

287
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:31,617
- [Bryan] You wanna go first?

288
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:32,450
- Just did it.

289
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,283
(whimsical music)

290
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,950
- All right Ollie, you get to go first.

291
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,194
Draw a card and figure out
which one you have to pull out.

292
00:09:45,194 --> 00:09:47,021
All right it says, "Clubbed foot.

293
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:48,655
"Oogie's leg is shaking hard.

294
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:50,918
"Play your hand and remove the cards."

295
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:54,251
(gasps) Can you do it?

296
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,253
- [Bryan] Alright Ollie.

297
00:09:57,253 --> 00:09:59,845
Use the tweezers and try
to get the clubbed foot!

298
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,542
All right Dr. Ollie!

299
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,358
Let's get that clubbed
foot out of Oogie Boogie.

300
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:07,191
(whimsical music)

301
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:10,184
- [Bryan] Almost, almost!

302
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:13,434
(yelling and laughing)

303
00:10:14,381 --> 00:10:16,035
What happened?

304
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:17,468
- [Missy] He got it the second try!

305
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:18,584
- [Bryan] He got it!

306
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,002
- Good job Ollie, you did it!
- Good job, dude!

307
00:10:22,002 --> 00:10:24,092
- You get a thousand dollars!

308
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,689
- [Bryan] A thousand dollars?

309
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:28,029
How many toys can you buy with
a thousand dollars, Ollie?

310
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:31,253
- Maybe I can get two of them!

311
00:10:31,253 --> 00:10:32,086
(Missy laughs)

312
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:33,699
- [Bryan] Maybe two toys, yes.

313
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:34,825
- All right Finn, it says,

314
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:36,485
"In order to get Oogie's voice back,

315
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:39,708
"extract the creepy little bat."

316
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,413
It says, "Bat's got your tongue."

317
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:44,890
- [Bryan] Bat's got
your tongue right here.

318
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,978
We gotta get that bat outta there.

319
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,005
Can you use the tweezers?

320
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:51,184
- [Missy] Can you get the
bat out with the tweezers?

321
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,336
(Finn shrieks)

322
00:10:53,336 --> 00:10:54,450
Ah, you lost!

323
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,256
- [Bryan] You lost!

324
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,072
- You gotta get it out like that.

325
00:10:58,072 --> 00:10:59,066
You wanna try again?

326
00:10:59,066 --> 00:11:00,419
You gotta squeeze it like this.

327
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,385
- [Bryan] Go ahead, try again!

328
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,545
(Finn shrieks)

329
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,497
(Bryan laughs)

330
00:11:06,497 --> 00:11:07,606
- [Missy] Oh, wow!

331
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:09,300
(Bryan and Missy laugh)

332
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,681
- [Bryan] He's using alternative
medicine, this doctor.

333
00:11:11,681 --> 00:11:14,003
- [Oliver] Here Finn, I'll help you, Finn.

334
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:17,336
- [Bryan] All right Ollie, you help him.

335
00:11:18,408 --> 00:11:19,741
Good job, Ollie!

336
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:22,564
- Good job!

337
00:11:22,564 --> 00:11:24,296
- All right, next up, boys.

338
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:27,605
We're getting the scorpion
sting for 300 bucks.

339
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:29,741
Oogie's life is on the line for sure.

340
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:32,828
Prevent the sting to find the cure.

341
00:11:32,828 --> 00:11:34,161
Should I get it?

342
00:11:35,813 --> 00:11:37,416
Oh my gosh, this is so hard.

343
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:38,249
Okay.

344
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,124
Oh, I did it!
- Got it.

345
00:11:41,124 --> 00:11:42,565
- Here you go, see?

346
00:11:42,565 --> 00:11:43,806
That's a scorpion.

347
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,426
I just pulled it out of Oogie Boogie.

348
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:46,318
- Good job.

349
00:11:46,318 --> 00:11:47,151
(laughs)

350
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:48,081
He always puts them back.

351
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:50,555
It says, "To stop Oogie
from feeling antsy,

352
00:11:50,555 --> 00:11:53,208
"remove the worms to suit his fancy."

353
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,208
Crawling flesh for $300.

354
00:11:56,337 --> 00:11:58,235
- [Bryan] All right, crawling flesh!

355
00:11:58,235 --> 00:12:00,487
Let's get that out of him.

356
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,913
Careful, careful, Mama!

357
00:12:02,913 --> 00:12:04,591
(shrieks)

358
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,688
She did it!

359
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,308
A little sloppy.

360
00:12:07,308 --> 00:12:09,305
A little sloppy on the
exit, but that's okay.

361
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:10,233
Oogie's dead.

362
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:11,830
- [Missy] All right, Ollie's turn again!

363
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:14,497
(Oogie yelling)

364
00:12:16,554 --> 00:12:18,707
(Finn shrieks)

365
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:22,457
(Oogie laughing and yelling)

366
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:31,642
- [Bryan] His bugs! His bugs!

367
00:12:35,086 --> 00:12:36,157
- Got it!

368
00:12:36,157 --> 00:12:37,240
- She did it!

369
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:40,560
You ready?

370
00:12:41,706 --> 00:12:44,289
(Finn shrieks)

371
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,519
I just like seeing his reaction.

372
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:49,739
Okay, let's actually try to get it.

373
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:50,822
Spider veins!

374
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:58,388
(shrieking and laughing)

375
00:12:59,618 --> 00:13:00,474
He's bleeding out!

376
00:13:00,474 --> 00:13:01,724
Doctor, doctor!

377
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,475
All right Finn, get the
needle and thread right there.

378
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:12,160
(yelling)

379
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,993
(whimsical music)

380
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:25,967
And Dr. Ollie is the winner!

381
00:13:27,729 --> 00:13:28,870
Congratulations, dude.

382
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,477
He is actually a lot better at this game

383
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,489
than I thought he would be.

384
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:32,322
- I know. I'm glad.

385
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:33,226
'Cause I feel like we've tried

386
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,497
to play a game like this in the past,

387
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:35,849
and he was like, "I don't get it."

388
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:37,728
- And Operation is a classic.

389
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:38,804
I used to play this all the time

390
00:13:38,804 --> 00:13:40,494
when I was a kid with the actual doctor.

391
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,753
His nose would light up.

392
00:13:41,753 --> 00:13:42,781
It was super cute.

393
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,132
But if you guys wanna see more fun games

394
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:45,822

a family on this channel,

395

397
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:51,192
But that was cool, huh?

398
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:53,535
I love Halloween games.

399
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,798
Are you playing tug of war?

400
00:13:54,798 --> 00:13:55,631
Oh no!

401
00:13:56,923 --> 00:13:57,756
Karma won.

402
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,094
There we go.

403
00:14:00,094 --> 00:14:01,482
He's got it!

404
00:14:01,482 --> 00:14:03,625
Oh, both the boys got it.

405
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,133
Karma's got his work cut out for him.

406
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:09,550
(drum beats)

407
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,879
All right, we are putting the kids to bed,

408
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,070
