1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:02,860
Yo guy what's up and welcome to the ultimate shooting challenge.

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,800
We are going to find out who's the best finisher is.

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,480
Right foot, left foot and then volley,

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,900
but first JJ, you are going to finish that, go on.

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,560
FINISH!

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,060
OH!

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,820
Yeah, you guy said we don't have good goalies.

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,000
Right, round one.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,680
Paint me like one of your french men.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,800
Right foot, it's got to be within the D, alright.

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,420
Ooooooooohh.

12
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,960
Arghhhh damn it Ethan.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,560
Arghhhhhhhhhh.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,240
Alright imma, imma just pass it in.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,380
Imma just pass it.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,600
Arghhh no Ethan.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,540
It's a lot different when there's pressure on you.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,420
Go on!

19
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,220
Oh my...

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,340
Well that was the worst round ever.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,840
Hit me baby!

22
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,400
One more time.

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,280
FUS RO DAH!

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,940
Okay.......

25
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,520
What is that?

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,720
Oh?!

27
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,740
Arghhhh.

28
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,780
(Laughter)

29
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,560
Yes Ethan!

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,240
Last go is it?

31
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,920
Oh my god. Oh my god.

32
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,040
Oh my god.

33
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,660
Bye have a great time.

34
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:24,720
This is tough.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,460
Yeah Mill wall can do this, who is passing it to me.

36
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,220
Me.

37
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,960
One touch and?

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,180
Ah no!

39
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,860
Mill, MILL!

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,580
It's always in the middle, right, ok.

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,380
Right, honestly, how did we win a football match?

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,020
Callux.

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,960
(laughter)

44
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,520
The **** is this?!

45
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,580
Yeah we're better from like the halfway line aren't we.

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,380
**** off!

47
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,700
Easy

48
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,460
Oh my god, Oh my god!

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,320
Now we have the second most subscribed Manny on Youtube.

50
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,320
There's one touch and...

51
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh there we go.

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,040
Ethan come on!

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes Ethan!

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,920
Good save.

55
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,720
One touch, AND!

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,960
Go on Vikk!

57
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,460
The touch!

58
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,700
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

59
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,000
See that was part of my plan.

60
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,280
Maybe if I aim for the crossbar.

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,700
ARGHHHH.

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,500
OH. MY. GOD.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,040
Do not let that in!

64
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,860
Yes Ethan!

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,880
NOT IN MY HOUSE!

66
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,920
Alright, keeper vibes.

67
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,540
NO!

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,740
NOOOOOO!

69
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going back in there.

70
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,720
Round two, left foot.

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
This isn't gonna go too well.

72
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,940
Alright left foot.

73
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,240
He's got one already.

74
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,040
Oh, you so almost let that in!

75
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,560
Lovely.

76
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,740
Wind it up, wind it up.

77
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,660
Winding it up.

78
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,660
I don't know what this is.

79
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,160
Here we go.

80
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,120
Finish me.

81
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,700
Oh there's the touch.

82
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,080
This is so slow.

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,560
What happened to go slow?

84
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,140
Yo I have no left foot.

85
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,300
What the **** was that?!

86
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not a passing challenge!

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,360
The goalie's mugging you off.

88
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,360
He's passing the ball.

89
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,020
Yes yes.

90
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,720
Ohhhh

91
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,440
Can we vote for JJ to leave the sidemen?

92
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,760
Sidemen referendum.

93
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,440
Oh god.

94
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,740
Can we say he has a right foot if he didn't score?

95
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:19,179
That was alright.

96
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,700
NO come on!

97
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,560
Go on josh!

98
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,080
**** off get out of goal!

99
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,140
Not in my house!

100
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,240
Oh he's flicked it up!

101
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,840
It's in!

102
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,880
Arghhhh

103
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,880
Lets see Mannys' left foot.

104
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Oi that was quickness.

105
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,380
Oh I like this

106
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,600
I was predicting that he was going there.

107
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:54,340
Last go Manny, can he make it two?

108
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,400
HE, doesn't.

109
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm not entirely sure my left foot can actually kick that far.

110
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,880
Oh this is gonna be atrocious.

111
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,960
Hey, wait, that reached.

112
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,180
I don't have.

113
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,820
Come on Vikk.

114
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,040
I TAKE A NAP! You wanna take a nap? I TAKE A NAP HERE!

115
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,000
Final go Vikk.

116
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,280
GO ON VIKK!

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,180
FINISH IT!

118
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,740
It doesn't help that he is like Pantilimon in goal.

119
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,060
He's ******* huge.

120
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,520
Nothing in this.

121
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,840
I look like Vikk.

122
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,800
Number four Ethan!

123
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,500
Go on Ethan.

124
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,240
We are all doing pretty awful, Manny's on three, Vikk's on two.

125
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,700
Final round is volleys.

126
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,800
This is where I get ******.

127
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
Alright, five goes.

128
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,340
Here we go.

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,120
BAP BAP!

130
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,380
I'm drawing with Manny!

131
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:17,860
OH NO!

132
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,000
Yeah!

133
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,780
I think Ethan should just stand on the left side now.

134
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,820
Will JJ get a goal today?

135
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,800
Let's go!

136
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,280
Please miss.

137
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,580
I like that yeah. It's a good start, good start.

138
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Oh my god. This is so BAD!

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,700
Right last one.

140
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,660
Go on Josh.

141
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,420
Wait that could be in.

142
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,360
Oh. That's good hands.

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Ok. Ok now you are a defender.

144
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,640
I've got four goals, you've got three, you need one to draw.

145
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,720
Is Manny gonna be on the MAP?!

146
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,540
Yes Ethan!

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
I'm here for you bae.

148
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,720
Oh there it is!

149
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,600
If i score, i win. If i miss, i draw. Simple as that.

150
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,380
WHAT ABOUT ME?! What about good old, good old fashioned Vikk?

151
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,580
YES ETHAN!

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Can I get a half volley, cause i'm like half a person?

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,420
Vikk, you can do whatever you want.

154
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,280
I let it bounce, and then...

155
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,600
We'll allow him to do whatever he wants.

156
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
No Ethan.

157
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,460
You know, he's still beating us.

158
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,240
It doesn't matter.

159
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,700
I TAKE A NAP HERE!

160
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,180
Final go Vikk!

161
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,980
A goal keepers' strong point is to like volley isn't it?

162
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,140
Alright, out of the park.

163
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,920
Well that just proves how rubbish we are, so, yeah. JJ, go for it.

164
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,060
I wanna score one!

165
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,860
Go on JJ!

166
00:08:58,540 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh my god. It couldn't have gone worse.
