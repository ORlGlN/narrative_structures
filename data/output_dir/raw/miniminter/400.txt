1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Yo Guys

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,420
Whats going on

3
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,800
And welcome to another sidemen vines reaction

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Now this is the 7th part. OK

5
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,860
So I know you guys are all thinking;

6
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,320
Let's get all the Sidemen Together

7
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:09,820
And...

8
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,780
They're not here

9
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,620
Maybe

10
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,900
Just Maybe

11
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,900
We may do a part 8 if there is one

12
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,900
But that would mean the next sidemen channel

13
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,900
Instead of like a challenge it would be that

14
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,380
Which I know some of you wouldn't prefer

15
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:21,820
Some of you would prefer a challenge

16
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,900
Regardless, the rest of the sidemen say Hi

17
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,300
Oh , no they actually do. Look

18
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:26,940
Hi

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,820
Hello

20
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:28,320
Hello. Hi

21
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,820
Hi

22
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,320
Hi

23
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,820
Hi

24
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,800
Josh: Why are we filming this? Vikk: suh dude suh

25
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,119
Anyways. As you guys know how this works

26
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,120
This is the best sidemen vines part 7

27
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,120
I've done it with everyone else, it's time for me

28
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,300
Ow !!!

29
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:37,800
Let's just GO !

30
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,460
I don't get it I've seen this before

31
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,980
*Music plays* You just a motherf**king copy cat

32
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,760
I should just react to my own videos for cringe compilations.

33
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
What the f**k

34
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,740
What are they even running away from in the actual film

35
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,620
Oh okay, it was the train

36
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,240
Oh

37
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:07,940
My

38
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:08,440
God

39
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,460
That may be the best remake I've ever heard in my life

40
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Oh no I've seen this one

41
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,140
Oh my God

42
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,520
I got sent that the other day

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,260
I literally

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,340
I saw that on Twitter

45
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,440
And I died

46
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,820
Huh, what's this

47
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,120
*laughs*

48
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,760
*chokes*

49
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,640
*silence*

50
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,300
What the f**k

51
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,680
Right okay this is a normal one

52
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:45,740
This

53
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:46,660
Okay

54
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,240
Yeah

55
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,740
Not a normal one now

56
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,080
I said that

57
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,220
I made that exact comparison

58
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,200
I mean I think he looks better as a Mike rather than a Sully

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,780
But

60
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,140
Yeah it is, it's a very close comparison

61
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,100
That's

62
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,300
Are these just singing ones

63
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,960
See I feel weird dancing to these

64
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,460
Because

65
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,140
It, it's like i just shouldn't, I shouldn't enjoy this !

66
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,580
What the f**k who is that

67
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,640
I've seen this

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,480
Yeah, I've seen it, I've seen it

69
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:26,680
What

70
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,200
What

71
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,480
There was way too much to handle just then

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,540
What is happening

73
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,120
Oh JJ is waxing my legs

74
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,780
Okay

75
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,400
Okay now

76
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,960
*singing* Makes a man go

77
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,520
It's that bit

78
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,660
Didn't even

79
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,160
It was the next

80
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:51,940
Man

81
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,960
Whoever made that vine, shame on you

82
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,280
It was meant to be the *Woodpecker noise*

83
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,400
It's always Josh

84
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,540
It

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,900
Is

86
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,560
There, there was nothing to it

87
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
It's just literally showing Josh in his natural habitat

88
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,300
I feel like Josh belongs in a Zoo

89
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,880
Every time you see a clip of Josh it's always him just being weird

90
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,760
But it's him trying to be normal

91
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,340
Alright

92
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,840
Oh badmen

93
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,620
Badmen

94
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,440
Pokemon hunting leads to Police chases

95
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,540
Er what

96
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,060
That didn't fit at all

97
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,600
See, this is, this shows the true weirdness of the Sidemen

98
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,880
And again what's he going to be

99
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,380
Sheep

100
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:34,980
Yeti

101
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,840
Ah I was close

102
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,620
I don't even know what that animal was, what was that

103
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,500
Was that an Alpaca

104
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,560
I think it was I didn't even know what an Alpaca was until just now

105
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Oh the classic hi again it's me

106
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,040
Yeah

107
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,280
That has been around since the beginning of vines

108
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,800
*Singing* It's a simple equation fam you get bare p's if you get bare views

109
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,320
Yo I wasn't ready for that

110
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,500
You guys are so mean to his music

111
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,420
I like it

112
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,200
What just happened

113
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,360
I felt like I've just been fisted in my brain

114
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,420
There was so much commotion at the end

115
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,200
Okay Pixar

116
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:22,660
Where does this one, where does this one end

117
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,920
Okay

118
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,020
And

119
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,640
There ah okay there oh and then ow oww owww

120
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,540
Okay

121
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,480
Match

122
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,420
Start

123
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,880
That is best Sidemen vines part seven

124
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,420
I don't really know what to say right now so

125
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,880
Yeah

126
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,760
Thanks everyone who made vines

127
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,460
I can't believe I've done seven parts on this

128
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,040
Thank you guys for watching and see ya

129
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,000

You sound disappointed

134
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,320
*laughs* What did I say

135
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,660
It doesn't even matter what positions we're going for. Trust me

136
00:05:06,660 --> 00:00:00,000
Yeah, what are we going to get, what are we going to get. It's a two
