22
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,250
memorabilia from the video i guess like

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,690
I've got a load here i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,160
you through it it's such a weird video

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,539
because i've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> this song for like</font>

26
00:00:57,539 --> 00:00:59,039
three months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the fact that it's</font>

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,020
actually here like you can you can

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,460
actually listen to and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of you</font>

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,899
have been tweeting me all day saying how

30
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,610
much you love it so I'm really really

31
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,520
glad you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it but I want to see the</font>

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,920
power of you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so things are a</font>

33
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760
little bit different now because

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,710
streaming verse buying so I don't really

35
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how well this is going to work the</font>

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,170
last rap song i did got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to number 42 in</font>

37
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,270
the download charts just on one day like

38
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:23,970
got to 42 in itunes download chart then

39
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,420
fell back out as it would only do this

40
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,790
song I think you guys can beat that but

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,590
it all depends on obviously if you guys

42
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,299
want to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how a</font>

43
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,970
stream works versus buying so it's on

44
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,250
iTunes is on app music it's on Spotify

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,840
Apple music and Spotify obviously you

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,270
stream that iTunes you can buy the song

47
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,729
for 99p to the difference between this

48
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,040
video and the first video<font color="#CCCCCC"> did is this</font>

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,920
video<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to make it like a proper</font>

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,740
music video and I'm not with a label I

51
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,360
don't have anyone like funding this so

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,939
everything in that video<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost a lot of</font>

53
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,850
money to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like that and all of</font>

54
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> money came out of my pocket which</font>

55
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">is fine because I wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that so</font>

56
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,979
I'm not I'm not saying the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> God I</font>

57
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,600
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fight a song to</font>

58
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,950
like make up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me spending money on</font>

59
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,568
the video that's not what I'm doing it I

60
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:11,370
just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to be able to like see the</font>

61
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,370
difference in like

62
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,560
effort from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first video to the</font>

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,090
second video because it's a big

64
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:17,830
difference like to me and everyone

65
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,810
involved and hopefully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys watching</font>

66
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,670
will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

67
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,940
basically I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

68
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,129
absolutely hilarious if basically if

69
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,370
this song gets into the top 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> by Sunday</font>

70
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,920
they have to play<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the radio like</font>

71
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,379
