heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fair on paranormal activity</font>

52
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,850
the film has been released in italy this

53
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:56,530
weekend and they've been really clever

54
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,060
about it too<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what they've done</font>

55
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,030
is they've given it no restrictions so

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,620
anyone could go and see it so a

57
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,290
three-year-old no way Marcus is that

58
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,380
true at three look at that necklace a

59
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,090
three-year-old<font color="#CCCCCC"> go in there and watch it</font>

60

<font color="#E5E5E5">that is mental like that is bonkers</font>

61
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,730
really well so this of course force

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,079
loads of young people to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and watch</font>

63
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,829
the film and in turn they all died<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

64
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,720
what was a little bit morbid what's a

65
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,350
helper puff basically I didn't realize

66
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,450
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would when you sighed youtube</font>

67
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,190
so how YouTube works like you film video

68
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,810
see hit record when I saw video a hit

69
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,060
record and I leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> running and then</font>

70
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,829
you know if I'm having a moment where I

71
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,060
don't speak then I speak you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make a</font>

72
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,329
cut right when I used to film videos

73
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,430
every sentence<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd say I'd hit record</font>

74
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,670
say the sentence stop record like why

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,110
did I do that that's why you can always

76
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,820
