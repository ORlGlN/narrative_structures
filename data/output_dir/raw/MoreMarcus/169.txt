00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,289
nine-to-five job or what's a

9
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,210
nine-to-five job I think maybe they mean

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,510
just a regular career like 95 office job

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,059
maybe 95 office job yeah well I I've got

12
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:36,989
fifa<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think yes easy to film is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

13
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:38,640
film videos every day easy to build

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,739
audience have creative ideas be popular

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:42,930
no not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to surely that's very difficult</font>

16
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,270
you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pick up a camera and then</font>

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,120
overnight become a monk tube sensation

18
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,980
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and work like that yeah because</font>

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,280
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's so hard because in their</font>

20
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,559
question is is it easier to film youtube

21
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,020
youtube videos every day then<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 15</font>

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,940
you're right like actually filming a

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,890
video it's not hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's not hard</font>

24
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,019
to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> a camera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not hot creating</font>

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the content for it I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was coming up the</font>

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,170
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it of course that's hard what I</font>

27
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,479
would argue is that when you're a

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,890
youtuber there's so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much more of your it</font>

29
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,960
is your light it becomes your life every

30
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,420
single day is your job but you can't

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,610
really switch off you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really step</font>

32
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,439
away you can't once you're there once

33
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,240
you're in the spotlight<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like that's</font>

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,549
it every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single day get used to it if</font>

35
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:27,900
you go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> about if you go for a</font>

36
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">breakup that's in front of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audience</font>

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,770
everything you go for in life is in

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,869
front of millions of people and that's

39
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:35,430
what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> say is but if you're</font>

40
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,990
listening now think of your personalized

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,579
pretty much every not everything but

42
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,900
like the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> moments in your</font>

43
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">personalized happen being witnessed by</font>

44
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,939
millions of people and everyone putting

45
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,979
their own spin<font color="#E5E5E5"> on things and Mike yeah</font>

46
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,869
and obviously like this could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

47
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">different 9 25 janvier maybe you have to</font>

48
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,549
face up to people we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to like if</font>

49
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,170
you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in retail or something</font>

50
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,610
like that your deal with customers or

51
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,469
with that like<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yes it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to do</font>

52
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">youtube videos in actually filming them</font>

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can testify from working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,890
you is that if you're a big youtuber

55
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,869
it's normally you should isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you only</font>

56
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:08,190
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things there as</font>

57
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,949
well I was definitely say I've work

58
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:13,920
longer hours in working terms then

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,380
9-10 like 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours a week yeah yeah</font>

60
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,090
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> also like say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to add up</font>

61
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,610
the social<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that Twitter and</font>

62
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,770
snapchat Instagram all these different

63
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,510
it's weird because it's like people

64
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,069
would say oh when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're tweeting are</font>

65
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,810
you working and it's like wool that's

66
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:29,819
true I don't I don't see it like that

67
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:31,739
all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> snaps out I think snapchats</font>

68
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,440
almost like daily vlogging I can see it

69
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,840
being like working technically I guess

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,250
yet because it's like you're engaging

71
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,660
with an audience but that's when it's

72
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,030
like how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see it because I I see</font>

73
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,099
that as I'm just doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I enjoy</font>

74
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,010
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm not waking up thinking I</font>

75
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,330
need to snapchat<font color="#E5E5E5"> this today I need to do</font>

76
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,100
that all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff around YouTube of</font>

77
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">social media comes as kind of like</font>

78
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,480
unless its brand specific content but

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,890
it's a very allies fascinating

80
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,500
fascinating question very difficult one

81
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,150
to answer definitively really isn't it

82
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,769
yeah it's also one of those ones that's

83
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:03,989
hard because it's like imagine comparing

84
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:06,030
an actor to a nine-to-five job is it's

85
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,790
like footballer 295 us all these things

86
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,680
is it's hard as well because a lot of

87
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,750
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their heads have the</font>

88
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,980
impression might if you would say a

89
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,200
footballer a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people OTT of people</font>

90
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,489
would be like yeah best<font color="#CCCCCC"> job in the world</font>

91
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,380
they should kick a ball about but what

92
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,780
actually goes into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> job is a lot</font>

93
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,489
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what unless you're in there or</font>

94
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:25,380
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably know what</font>

95
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,390

96
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,850
footballers now but i am with you

97
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,170
there's probably a lot more to the eye

98
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,780
than we see ya being a footballer it's

99
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,700
just of something with a footballer it's

100
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,920
