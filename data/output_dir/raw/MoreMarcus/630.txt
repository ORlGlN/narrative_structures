I'm just so much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was filming all</font>

48
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,040
this myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I was lying in this bed</font>

49
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,990
with this doll was like trying to vlog

50
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,120

<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and library great a</font>

54
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,930
camera angles panning it oh my god

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,970
there's a good oil oil I actually

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,830
thought about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to rewatch</font>

57
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:50,320
that oh my god it's because in the

58
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,210
trailer this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Taylor law nuts</font>

59
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,880
obviously like buff shit and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> stands</font>

60
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,740
up and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like absolutely tank</font>

61
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,690
I'm obviously trying to recreate that

62
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,940
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening for me</font>

63
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,680
fella you don't have to change for me

64
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,549
again no response fell in love you it

65
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:14,400
all begins with a choice you has to

66
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,950
consider the idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need deposit I</font>

67
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:18,900
really really need to pause this because

68
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,840
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this I'm playing two people</font>

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,969
usually when you pay to people if you're

70
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,500
doing sketch you have two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,450
camera angles so one like this would be

72
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">on me here then you switch it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

73
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,480
the person in a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> location</font>

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">different background but there I lines</font>
