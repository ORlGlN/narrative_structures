00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,549
hello everybody welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> episode 11 /</font>

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:08,130
lower your expectation so another

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,940
topical<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube thing recently has been</font>

4
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the subject of vlogging and how it was</font>

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of first touched upon by PewDiePie</font>

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,240
and then Casey brought up and mentions

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,010
and Franco loads of people have talked

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">about vlogging and how the these people</font>

9
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,750
who daily vlog<font color="#E5E5E5"> force positivity kind of</font>

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:26,670
like sharing the best moments of their

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,099
day with everyone and then that can have

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,300
a negative effect on people because

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,980
people wouldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,969
impression they have their day and their

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:34,980
like their life is incredible what's my

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,290
life rather odd or as a viewer do you

17
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:39,450
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching someone if someone's</font>

18
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:41,850
like up today's a bit I'm a bit

19
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,040
down because<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube the escapism isn't</font>

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,200
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like the idea of spreading</font>

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,059
positivity you're sharing a part of your

22
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,430
day that's happy happy happy and you can

23
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,260
make someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else feel those happy vibes</font>

24
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,149
smile I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great I think the</font>

25
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,340
issue is if people especially young

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,410
people who assume that that's what

27
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,940
people's lives amenah be like it's an

28
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,010
idealistic life that isn't actually

29
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,510
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah you know it's not possible</font>

30
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,479
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-four seven positives yeah</font>

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,369
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not real it's not real</font>

32
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:10,049
life it but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a daily vlog</font>

33
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:11,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're so personal and it can see</font>

34
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,799
measure it's kind of a bit like how I

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,659
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Instagram where you look at</font>

36
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:17,580
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> his Instagram you're like their</font>

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,080
life is incredible but you've got to

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,340
think that's literally at the one

39
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,810
percent of their life they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">with you yeah and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like</font>

41
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,830
showcasing how could your life is I feel

42
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:27,450
like daily vlogging is like that but

43
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,070
well that's all I think it's so sad that

44
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,710
youtubers have to do a video if they've

45
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">had a breakup of thing is that's the one</font>

46
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,070
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to do videos and</font>

47
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,470
it's such a personal but sour of all

48
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,450
thing yeah that's what that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

49
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,979
of the drawbacks being a youtuber you're

50
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,689
sharing a life of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and if people</font>

51
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:44,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">get so used to seeing things in certain</font>

52
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,170
ways when they're not in those ways

53
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">anymore people realize and people start</font>

54
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:50,009
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and no use them feel</font>

55
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,960
like I need to let my only note I

56
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,340
guess when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about that</font>

57
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,619
rather than the content is going out and

58
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,420
when you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> until notice p</font>

59
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,009
daily vlogging you are showing your life

60
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,540
but if you're only showing the positive

61
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,790
side all the time why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

62
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,710
then show a negative like a breakup was

63
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,930
also hard because if you start showing

64
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,389
negative like in a relationship online

65
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:11,849
what you're actually sharing is a very

66
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:13,280
personal in

67
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,410
relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of outside</font>

68
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,690
opinion and you then have people

69
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,760
commenting on the things that you're

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,890
sharing and that could then worse in the

71
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,540
relationship because if you're sharing

72
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,370
those ups and downs like the Downs is

73
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,110
going to be you know you might people

74
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,450
start siding with each other it's just a

75
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,970
 is like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shift on that nice crazy</font>

76
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,590
man to beat me<font color="#E5E5E5"> up that's why I don't</font>

77
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">daily vlog I don't want that in pleasure</font>

78
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm I pressure and I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a year</font>
