00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,970
from London from Brighton to London has

109
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,890
hasn't seemed like a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal at all but</font>

110
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,700
it feels the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that we're so central</font>

111
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,350
and we can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop out for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our meetings</font>

112
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,820
rather than have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about getting</font>

113
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,710
a two-hour train up to brighten up to

114
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,800
London then spend the day there and then

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,650
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to our train back it's like nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

116
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:08,080
know we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop in a car or hop on</font>

117
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
the tube and we're like BAM central

118
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,150
London who is behind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly nobody</font>

119
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:17,590
or at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd hope so that there's</font>

120
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,140
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding behind there how do you</font>

121
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">say syrup Sarah what keeps you motivated</font>

122
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:29,110
love your videos ah that's a really

123
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,570
really good question so motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

124
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,010
something that everyone can<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve it's</font>

125
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,350
just how you go about achieving that

126
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:42,460
a lot of people the main thing that you

127
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,930
should have for motivation is yourself

128
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,700
so it's great that other people can

129
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,410
inspire you and you can have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

130
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,380
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivate you but at the end of the</font>

131
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,600
day the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who really can</font>

132
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,970
motivate you is yourself so it's how

133
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:00,640
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that myself and how I</font>

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,160
best motivate myself and it depends all

135
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,060
way to ignite for talking about

136
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,350
motivating yourself to go to the gym

137
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,930
motivating yourself to go out the house

138
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,470
like all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that I do</font>

139
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">will have different levels of motivation</font>

140
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,250
for them that sounded really he liked

141
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,010
science and technical but it's kind of

142
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,140
true you know like my motivation to go

143
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,230
to the gym is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I'm ever feeling</font>

144
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,350
unmotivated I will look at how I used to

145
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:31,540
look in a picture of my body and think

146
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,840
cool I don't want to look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yes</font>

147
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,760
it's combination of food and the gym so

148
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,670
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as a hair in my mouth if it's</font>

149
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about motivating myself for</font>

150
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,580
videos it's me thinking of a video<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

151
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:50,020
I've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun making and want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give</font>

152
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,850
myself that happiness and that joy of

153
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,720
putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> something out that I'm happy</font>

154
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,540
with as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as what you guys enjoy</font>

155
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:58,930

videos and do all the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

157

207
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:22,510

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,390
comes to the top of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rap game are you</font>

209
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,790
still thinking of getting a dog or not

210
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,820
now as you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> london if no must</font>

211
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,810
answer this question she would say yes

212
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,760
the answer is still we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are thinking of</font>

213
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,670
it definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also need to weigh up</font>

214
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,010
how much we travel what we can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

215
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:45,490
dog when we travel like can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

into dog hotels could be given to

217
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,550
friends for the day and obviously way up

218
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,980
having a dog because it's a huge

219
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,920
commitment but one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we would</font>

220
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,440
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> be capable of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and ready</font>

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,680
to take so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's definitely on the</font>

222
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,310
