46
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,210
leaving because he wasn't getting the

if I ever happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> like with the</font>

50
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,130

would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you quit it's hard like as a</font>

52
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,060
youtuber you've always thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about ups</font>

00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,219
and downs and like you have good mum

54
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,979
share bad months but and everyone always

55
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,450
other questions what you're going to do

56
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:05,100
after what you can do after and I feel

57
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it's got to a point with me where</font>

58
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,369
I've got so much other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

59
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:10,470
doing that if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel starts if</font>

60
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,270
people stop watching that we'd be doing

61
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,040
other stuff create

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,959
anyway like what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

63
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:17,219
moment like we'd still be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

64
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:19,799
podcast or it'd still be writing stuff

65
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:22,049
