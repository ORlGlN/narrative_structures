video asking your guys advice on

19

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,080
hair yes well<font color="#CCCCCC"> done you've got blonde</font>

25
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,330
hair now what's happening is when I dyed

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,000
my hair blonde how I wanted it to look

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,070
was how it looks now so like the roots

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,510
have come through and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top it</font>

29
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,330
looks like this and like I really really

30
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,610
like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks been nearly eight</font>

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,369
weeks since i first had it dyed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on</font>

32
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:23,939
the sides you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it is pretty much</font>

33
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:26,280
like growing out because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my sides are</font>

34
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">very short I've already had one haircut</font>

35
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,890
since then so you can see both<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides and</font>

36
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to give you a little like</font>

37
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,700
situation i'm at now is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get my</font>

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,310
hair cut or colored or ever it's do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,100
read I the whole thing because as<font color="#E5E5E5"> much i</font>

40
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,840
love this on the top I can't just leave

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this on the top like this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

42
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,140
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to completely go so</font>

43
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,750
then it will be like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing no blonde</font>

44
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,020
in it at all so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I want to</font>

45
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,610
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is what do you think I should do</font>

46
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when I first dyed it and had the</font>

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,020
whole thing bleached it was very intense

48
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,939
and everyone was like I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it</font>

49
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:02,549
why didn't love it when I first<font color="#E5E5E5"> I done</font>

50
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:05,549
because it's so in your face<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that is</font>

51
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,710
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only way to get your hair</font>

52
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,869
how you like it so that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font>

53
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:12,569
I'm asking do I would you think I should

54
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:13,890
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I read I the</font>

55
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,780
then and wait for it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

56
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">till starts go out and starts look</font>

57
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,040
