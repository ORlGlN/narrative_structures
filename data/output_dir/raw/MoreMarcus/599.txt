36
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,350

41
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,440
sound quality it basically is very

42
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,450
adaptive so it changes for each song and

43
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,280
it basically is not your back in the

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,220
studio making your beats and tracks like

45
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,440
