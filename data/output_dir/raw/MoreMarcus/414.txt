00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,630
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been holding it so long to share it</font>

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,359
because it's literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my pottery one</font>

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,250
emotion<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baris things I've ever done I'm</font>

10
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,869
this was back in the day this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 9th of</font>

11
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,520
april 2010 that's six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago literary</font>

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,170
six years ago when I was just starting

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:37,980
out I was messing about and Shane Dawson

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,500
was a massive inspiration to me he's one

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the people that inspired me to start</font>

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,219
YouTube and still is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

favorite channels just<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a heads</font>

18
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,750
up the concept was it's like I'm

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,460
collabing with Shane but i'm not

20
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,129
actually clapping with him because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

21
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,680
took his videos and found clips from his

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,440
videos and cut them and then made my own

23
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">videos to go in through so it looked</font>

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,129
like we were clapping from around the

25
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,409
world but really I was just stealing his

26
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,790
video clips here we go to smaller

27
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:15,000
bedroom I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the effort as well</font>
