14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,110
other day my drawer open the drawers

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,200
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big con I think</font>

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty sure i did and i never used it so</font>

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,579
i used it and it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing it's</font>

19
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:45,840
so cool i'm still trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,180
how to use it properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe what we</font>

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,280
should do is take picture mail and see

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,629
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's light at the end but i'm very</font>

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">much so figuring out how to use it it's</font>

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,920
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complex than the other</font>

25
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,199
ones but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel like once I've conquered</font>

26
00:00:58,199 --> 00:00:59,820
it it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be amazing I've only</font>

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,680
taken about five pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so far</font>

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,629
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is gonna be my sixth picture</font>

29
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:05,640
basically this way looks like this is

30
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,409
far away this is for anything that's

31
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:09,720
four feet or further and this is for

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,820
close-up so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a mix of flowers</font>

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,830
or if you're doing selfies which is what

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to be doing about this bar</font>

35
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:17,400
here I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out what one side</font>

36
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,860
is white one tights black I think it's

37
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,830
like if it's darker move it to the black

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,630
side if it's lighter to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light side</font>

39
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,210
but I honestly I'm pig that one out yet

40
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,520
let's try we're gonna try putting it

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,520
here just going to see see go on then

42
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,250
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheeky selfie</font>

43
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,010
and it shoots out the bottom so your

44
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,020
mana cover Polaroids in the dark for

45
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,490
them to for the film's come out this

46
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,650
puts a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> film over it the only</font>

47
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,790
thing that's doing with these these take

48
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,460
a little longer to come out and that is

49
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,650
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's better quality and</font>

50
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,750
better film and blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> blah yeah</font>

51
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,430
this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite things i've</font>

52
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,110
been using recently number two we're

53
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:58,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">moving on to is simple sweet and simple</font>

54
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,570
caps I if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you follow me on snapchat or</font>

55
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,250
if you follow me on various social media

60
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,930
massive head and not that many caps ever

61
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,870
fit my head been searching for months to

62
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,390
find other ones found these through some

63
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,670
random account on Instagram can t

64
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,470
remember where that from I will find out

65
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,780
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no label in them I think</font>

66
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,760
they're only like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pounds each maybe</font>

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,290
15 pounds each it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really cool because</font>

68
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,300
ones are me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got tears on it</font>

69
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">you've seen I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been wearing these</font>

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,810
recently so I mean it probably doesn't

71
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:37,060
go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pattern synchronization</font>

72
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,980
right now this is one they're exactly

73
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,780
the same hat so I don't know I'm trained

74
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,790
this is yellow and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to</font>

75
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,010
me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a hat that fits my massive</font>

76
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,620
fat head looks half decent as well okay

77
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">next I'm going to show you is this app</font>

78
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,820
called quidco now I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you</font>

79
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,400
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see but right here and quick code</font>

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,850
basically allows you to shop loads<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

81
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,440
your favorite stores that you'd normally

82
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,480
shop online but you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through this</font>

83
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,090
app and you can save money what's doing

84
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,579
it so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you like to shop on</font>

85
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,230
a sauce you can shop on a sauce through

86
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,230
this app and you pay the same amount

87
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,610
that you pay if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for a</font>

88
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">sauce but they'll give you ten percent</font>

89
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,660
cash back so for example if you were to

90
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,190
buy something<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty pounds on a</font>

91
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,500
sauce you get temp set back of that you

92
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,019
would get two pounds back so if you do a

93
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,790
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of online shopping and this isn't</font>

94
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,470
just shopping this is like loads of

95
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,130
different things from insurance to

96
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,380
fashion to bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bobs it covers so</font>

97
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,910
many things and if you do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

98
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,930
online shopping it kind of makes sense

99
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,340
use this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to be</font>

100
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,989
