every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day one minute look now places to</font>

61
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,950
live in London that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

62
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,090
Brighton

63
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,959
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't know and everyone I'm</font>

64
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,269
speaking to will either be able to

65
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:23,430
swayed me one persuade me one way to

66
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,319
London or sway my mind and switch over

67
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,599
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to brighten and it's just I just</font>

that I look I can't find anything like

73
00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:47,579
basically a problem is London is one of

74
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,709
the most expensive place to live in the

75
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:51,810
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> where its Bryton brighton still</font>

76
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,640
expensive to live but nowhere near

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">London so what I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my money in</font>

78
