46
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,579
like sometimes our fans get angry if

47
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,579
it's not a prank although this is kind

48
00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:07,319
of a prank<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun with</font>

49
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:11,489
helium and you know it's funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

50
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:15,200
funny to do but kids when you use helium

51
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,609
don't do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that much people have died</font>

52
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:20,190
before doing it so so make sure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

53
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,750
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do kill him maybe you do like</font>

54
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,280
one or two breasts and you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> break</font>

55
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,799
for a little while because helium a

56
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,880
science lesson for a helium replaces the

57
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,120
oxygen in your system so if you're

58
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting in all this helium and not</font>

59
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,859
taking in any oxygen the yolk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>
