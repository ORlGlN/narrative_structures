00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:27,500
I need to get a dog. Her dog's name is Rari aka Ferrari, and that's the Ferrari store.

22
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,900
So we're basically at the mall right now no one has caught or

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:32,900
Can you not see anything you just walked into the wall

24
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,500
But we're in the mall right now we're trying to stay lowkey because we're just trying to  be in and out

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,790
Look mono heads

26
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:46,019

27
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,019
Rice what does this say?

28
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:51,900
Okay, that's racist cuz I don't know this looks ridiculously good

29
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,900

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,800
You bought so much stuff is this like a hat

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,879
That dog is really lucky right now

00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,720
I like that laugh

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,300
I was just thinking that shirt that I just bought was like three hundred and fifty dollars whatever it was one shirt

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,310
That was like 30 items dawg

36
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,460
So why we in the boys boxer section Sommer

37
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,000
Because sometimes my underwear just doesn't fit my dick

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,340
I found you some underwear

39
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:28,259
Alright we decided to dip the mall and hit this what uh drug deal or sum why are we in this random uh

40
00:02:28,259 --> 00:02:31,700
Well I was thinking that it might be a little scary to go in the  dark ally

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,900
But since rice knows karate

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:42,030
We had to go through some sketchy area, but we came out alive he really does where boy boxers

43
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,030

47
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:02,339
Because I've been tough. I swear to God anyone comments. I wore this shirt like two vlogs go OK

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,689
I only work for half the fireworks like four hours that means that you wear this for like five more hours it

49
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,789
Let's take it off after don't think I wear the same thing every day

50
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:13,439
And you guys know how summers room is really messy. I really like how she's taking a step and trying to fix it
