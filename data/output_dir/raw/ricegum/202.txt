00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
amazing  video watch it

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
 

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,340
After sleepless nights, and nonstop researching.

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:04,840
I came to the conclusion that,

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,460
these kids are still on the loose.

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,380
and out there making Musical.lys

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,440
Theres so many kids out there

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
that must be stopped

9
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,440
and it is my duty to put an end to this

10
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,280
or at least try to

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,860
So many innocent lives are effected

12
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,860
by these videos

13
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,720
and one day, they will be stopped.

14
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,840
I'm back due to popular demand

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,980
everyone keeps askin'

16
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,300

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,780
So i'm bout to, do a part 4.

18
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,780
No explination,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,980
basically, these kids

20
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,500
must be stopped.

21
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,660
I'm just gonna hop right into it.

22
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,380

25
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,780

26
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,780

27
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,940

29
00:00:51,940 --> 00:01:03,800
*Music Playing* (Sorry by Justin Beiber)

30
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:06,100
Is it too late now to say sorry?!

31
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,980
Yes it is cuz i just saw this so

32
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,960

33
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,840

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,820
why is she making these Music.lys

35
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,060
when like her house is like extra, extra messy

36
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,060
like you can easliy just be just be cleaning up your house.

37
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,060
*music playing*

38
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,160
So before the video even starts

39
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,420
she already hands herself an L.

40
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,820
So we already know, this is about to be bad.

41
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:34,360
*music playing*

42
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,260

44
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,580

45
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,240

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:57,680

*Music Playing* (Young, Wild and Free by Snoop Dogg &Wiz Khalifa - ft Bruno Mars)
