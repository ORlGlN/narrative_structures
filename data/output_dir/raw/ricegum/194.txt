1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,800
hey

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,020
Yo what's up man ..ahh!

3
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,520
I've noticed that ever since I started my series

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,920
"THESE KIDS MUST BE STOPPED"

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,320
These kids have been actually behaving

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,320
and I think they are actually stopping.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,160
Like

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,780
It's crazy and..

9
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,480
and the streets have been so clean lately.

10
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,060
It's..it's amazing.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,340
And although these kids behaving is a good thing,

12
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,340
it's also a bad thing

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,240
'cause I have no videos to, like, talk about

14
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,560
or critique.

15
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,900
But that's not gonna stop me.

16
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,000
I've been staying up every night, researching.

17
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,680
Try'na find the last remaining kids

18
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,680
that must be stopped, right?

19
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
But with that being said,

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,100
this might be my last video

21
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
from this series.

22
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,800
Back due to popular demand

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,660
You guys kept asking

24
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,280
"RiceGum, do a part 5,

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,060
These kids must be stopped #5"

26
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,180
Relax, alright. Relax.

27
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,260
I'll do a part 5,

28
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,020
when I do a part 5

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,680
but today, I'm doing a part 5.

30
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,280
Do you guys know how these things work?

31
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,600
Lets just jump right into it

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,480
Roll the clip.

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,560
(Oh, it's just me, myself and I.
Solo ride until I die)

34
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,960
('Cause I got me for life)

35
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,680
(Oh I don't need a hand to hold.
Even when the night is cold)

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,120
Even when the night is cold?

37
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,380
No shit, the night is cold.

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,700
You're literally wearing nothing, alright?

39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,240
So not only, not only, is she not matching, right?

40
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,000
And she's, you know,

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,180
showing a lot of skin for her age.

42
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,480
She thought me, myself and I is three people.

43
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,740
*It's just me, myself and I*

44
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:36,320
She really thought me, myself and I is

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,080
three different people when, in reality, it's one person.

46
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,680
Me, myself and I, right?

47
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,700
And not to mention, whose toes are these?

48
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,980
Like...next video, man.

49
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,000
Where do I begin?

50
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,120
So first off, he tries to make a heart with his hand, right.

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,060
So this is how you do it.

52
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,300
And please don't screenshot that,

53
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,580
'cause you'll never catch me slipping.

54
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,180
But that's clearly a triangle, right?

55
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,200
And then he precedes to say

56
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,680
Let me buy you a drink, right?

57
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,360
Apparently hand soap or, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,320
So apparently this guy thinks that this is a drink.

59
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,320
Whatever you do,

60
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,800
if this guy comes to the club and buys you a drink,

61
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,240
I think this shit is poisonous.

62
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,460
Do not drink it.

63
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,920
Whatever you do, do not

64
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,660
Do not drink it.

65
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,980
The lyrics said "you can me my it girl"

66
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,980
baby you a shit girl

67
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,020
And she's literally, actually,

68
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,340
taking a shit.

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,920
I don't know how I feel about this,

70
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:21,000
'cause, like, part of me is like damn she's really dedicated,

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,460
and, and she's taken this to another level.

72
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,820
But then again that's just nasty,

73
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,640
and she's, yeah, no, this must stop right now.

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,840
That's not okay, this is not okay!

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,500
I don't know who this guy thinks he is,

76
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,300
but this has to stop.

77
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,520
What was that, what was this thing?

78
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,680
And like, you guys know me, right?

79
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,840
I'm not, I'm not mean. I just speak the truth.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,920
But he needs to change his haircut 'cause

81
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,320
I thought, I thought it was a lesbian.

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Uhm, yeah i just wanted to call to report

83
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
this killer on the loose

84
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
i can´t really describe her , i mean it´s like a

85
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,920
You know who the donkey from shrek is?

86
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,920
basically it that, or like a potato

87
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,080
She is crazy, and uhm

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,260
someone needs to play an end to this

89
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,900
as soon as possible

90
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,980
You guys are still seven.

91
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,340
Well, by the looks of my imaginary watch, this is a pretty short video

92
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,120
so I might as well just tell you guys this story.

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,060
I can't believe you.

94
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,020
No, no, no. I was just checking my myspace.

95
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,700
I saw what you were doing.

96
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,600
Why would you do that?

97
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,180
You know I hate that shit.

98
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,100
I mean, dude, the app is pretty fun, I mean

99
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,960
I've already gotten two fans.

100
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,920
I don't even know who you are anymore.

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,180
Please tell me you'll never do that again.

102
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,000
I mean, I just wanna be like Jacob one day.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 

104
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,880
I didn't want to do this,

105
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,680
but you left me no choice.

106
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,800
 

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,200
RIP AFROGUM guys he was a really good friend

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,120
but anyways, if you guys did enjoy the video and wast a part 6

109
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,280
you know what to do, like the video, comment

110
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,600
i read every single comment and subscribe to the channel

111
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,840
check out my other stuff.

112
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,320
But yeah, no it is true though ever since i´ve made

113
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,120
this little series, these kids actually been stopping

114
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,320
and i haven´t been noticing to much of these "bad musiclys"

115
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
so, it´s a good thing

116
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
though you know i´m trying to help out humanity

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,240
but it does kind of suck because like this is like my most popular series

118
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,960
and i won´t have any more videos to like talk about

119
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,400
and you know critique and if these kids stop

120
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,520
so hopefully they don´t stop but i do want them to stop

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,720
I-I dont know it´s weird but anyways

122
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
more videos to come

123
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,160
have so much disktractios saved up

124
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,440
got skits, got videos just ready

125
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,800
I just need to manage my time better and just drop these as soon as possible

126
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,520
but thank you so much for all the support

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
like the video, subscribe

128
00:08:27,520 --> 00:00:00,000
