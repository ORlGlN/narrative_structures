1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,260
Hey guys, it's me again!

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,260
And..  uhh  this is probably the craziest week of my life

3
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,120
right, not only am I about to hit one million subscribers

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,480
which is so crazy, but I was roasted again by a kid by a little kid right,

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,980
When will these kids learn to not mess with me, right!

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,520
But this time, I wasn't roasted by one kid

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,900
I was roasted by TWO kids

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
and I can sit here and talk about--

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,220
'Hey guys it's me again and now I'm mad and make two separate videos'

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,480
you know, trying to handle my business, right?

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,160
But I was like 'you know what? I want to test, test my roasting abilities'

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,440
and see if I am capable

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,700
of dissing two kids, in one video

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,280
so you guys are probably wondering:  Rice Gum, who is it this time?'

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,160
He goes by the name of Bruhitszach

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,700
15 years old, two million followers on musically

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,000
and almost a million on Instagram

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,340
he was live streaming one night and it had like 7000 current viewers

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,200
And they were watching him and he knows

20
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,520
he knows that I love making diss tracks

21
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,040
And he is gonna sit there and challenge me?

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,480
At my own game

23
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,560
*you know what? alright, hold one, I don't want you to see my face yall*

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,622
*I'm gonna be a hidden mask*

25
00:01:21,622 --> 00:01:23,860
*I'm sorry, but yall don't need to watch me when I do this*

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
yall just.... yall just look at the ceiling

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,800
*While I roast on Ricegum, I'm too scared*

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,440
*Alright, here we go, I'm gonna get on him*

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
*Show him whose real*

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,520
*rapping badly*

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,160
*I really didn't want to do this to you*

32
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,760
*Why you looking dirty at me doing Youtube*

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,620
Then you went and turned into a little fruity loop

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,320
*making friends with all the kids you dissed on Youtube*

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,820
*I have a question for you Mr RiceGum*

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,000
*How come everytime you smile, all I see is dumb*

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,480
That was fire yall!

38
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,060

39
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,220

00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,520

46
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,340

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
talking about fire, fire ten out of ten

48
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,720
and I was just sitting here like

49
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,720
that was average at best, like it was ok I guess

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,480
and I thought me and zach were cool like there were times when I caught him slipping , but I let it slide

51
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:41,880
But, this time he is gonna pay the price. But, before that another talentless kid famous for no reason

52
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,240

58
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,880

59
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
