47
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,680
There's Drona and Daniela broccoli also known as cash me outside girl. She basically got a dr.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,359
Phil from being mean to her mom and now she's someone has a career, and she's making music you just drop the song

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:45,079

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,660
These heaux

51
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:53,809
Official music video I have this deed and you know my first hit single every night sis is on the Billboard Top 100

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,540
This was the first official song I've ever done anyways

53
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,959
I just feel like I have a really good grasp on music ain't oh good music for bad music basically

54
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,859
I know what the F**k going on anyways enough chitter chatting check. Let's jump into it

55
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,669
Okay, she just gets dropped off the new uber. That's just walking towards my direction

56
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:20,129
Hello can I help you I mean why do you keep staring at me? It's kind of awkward making Eye con- What do you want?!

57
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,390
Guys I don't even know how to pronounce this word, I don't even know what it means I'm gonna just go with it

58
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,510
Wait a minute is That a gun

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,110
Yo, who is this guy

60
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,670
Okay what the song hasn't even   started yet out confused some dude has a gun I'm scared

61
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:10,350
Knowing and this is like the hook of the song right this should be the catchiest part of the song the lyrics really isn't anything

62
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,249
Too crazy the flow the melodies is not too. Catchy, but look it's okay

63
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,839
The song just started you can redeem yourself in the verse. I think her verses about the start now. Let's see if it's fire

64
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:36,239
Okay, okay, this girl has 13. She's over here cursing up a storm staying all these bad words

65
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,819
I don't like you, but I would not break down her verse a little bit

66
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,579
So she said these hoes be fake flossing fake jewlery

67
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,979
we got her neck rash these hoes be fake ball and tax money that shit won't last these hoes be dick right in and they

68
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,779
Say like these hoes be full of drug basically

69
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:49,589
She's talking about these hoes

70
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:54,779
And how they're all wack if she's better basically essentially what I'm trying to say is this is could be a song whatever you know

71
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,719
its her hit single or whatever, but this is a diss track. She's talking about these hoes

72
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:03,449
This is a diss and we all know who made the diss track trend that thing you know this guy right here because I got

73
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:09,808
A bag on a grand, maybe six legs these are they wake up they broke. They mattresses be on the floor

74
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:13,648
Okay, I don't know who she's talking about he's talking about these hoes

75
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:17,609
It's very vague, and I'm listening to the song and this could be talking about me for all I know

76
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,339
I don't know. She's calling me, broke. She said my mattress is on the ground

77
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,280
I'm obviously not broke my matress

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,769
is not on the ground

79
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,849
But I do remember when I was broke and when my mattress was on the ground. It wasn't too long ago

80
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,289
You guys know one of my old videos

81
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,318
You know I was reacting to whatever and my mattress was literally on their ground

82
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,169
I got closets it might have been like you know sometimes. You know in life

83
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,049
There's other important things to buy than a bed frame. I mean I don't know

84
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,050
I really don't like how she's come at us and and

85
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,148
Kind of roasting us for being broke ever you get roast us for really anything

86
00:06:42,148 --> 00:06:45,780
But you know money sometimes people can't control whatever. Let's keep it going

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,320
*tf is this bish saying?*

88
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,100
uh , you huys must subscribe to noonpick !

89
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,940
*is confusion* search on youtube!

90
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:00,140
Is that tanna  Mongoose, maybe she's doing lip injections by injection she doesn't have real life. That's a pretty good representation

91
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,140
I'm pretty sure that that's her x2

92
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,640
Who is this guy who is this guy I saw at the start of the video he was holding the gun

93
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,270
I was confused by a landslide now. I see linkit he's pulled out of the window

94
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,420
I won't get it what why was he representated into the video. He has to you know me and suddenly

95
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,640
I don't get it, and I'm confused I really

96
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,060
guys what is that noise guys?

97
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:33,220
How can I be the biggest YouTube in the world and and work towards my dream and one day have a fanbase?

98
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,549
If I can't even make videos in peace my house is so loud. I can't even work in peace

99
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,619
So that sommer rays birthday partie you had like four parties already, so there's a cake

100
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,869
Right there bro like I'll get them to be so mad

101
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,470
Oh

102
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,568
I'm chill upstairs look who I ran into

103
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,590
He ain't never get a nicer house to meet I was like I got to start hanging out this

104
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,760
Long does it take for food to travel down your neck

105
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
It's all good in the hood

106
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
This guy's seven five

107
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,900
Alright guys, I'm back. It's pretty popped upstairs, but this is

108
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,500
What is she say and I understand a word she's saying she's mumbling there's autotune

109
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,450
She's just she's really not that good at music

110
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,920
She'd really stop doing music and just stick to what she's good at She should just stick to

111
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,840
Wait, what is she even good at what is she even famous for?

112
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,340
Hold on she just said red cup no, it ain't cool aid

113
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,560
what's in the red cup is it orange juice is it water like you can't just say that and

114
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,280
Then not tell us what it is like instead of saying kool-aid

115
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:49,620
You should have just told us when it was what's in your cup you're only 14

116
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,020
I really hope you're not implying that you're drinking off something illegal

117
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,570
All right

118
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,229
wow
That was not appealing to the ears at all the lyrics werent the best

119
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,460
The video was all right though the video was dumped. It was shot in one shine looks smooth

120
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:12,359
That was sick, but I mean I had nothing to do with her. I'm actually really disappointed that dr.

121
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,570
Phil didn't have a verse on this side, and I feel like he's responsible for her career

122
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:20,960
He should have had a feature maybe  a few bars in there,i don't know net but overall I would never listen to this song again

123
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:25,000
She is 14 though right so that's really young and she could easily get better over time

124
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,970
So I want to see where this takes her

125
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,089
But I mean she should stick to what she's being good at and

126
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,300
I don't I don't even know but before you guys take off the video

127
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,050
