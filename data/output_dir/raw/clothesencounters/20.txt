1
00:00:05,389 --> 00:00:06,299
- Hey, everyone.

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,156
It's your girl Jenn and
today I have a fresh batch of

3
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:10,383
favorites for you.

4
00:00:10,383 --> 00:00:14,194
We are coming very very close
to the last month of 2017

5
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:17,489
and I'm so excited because
I love the holiday season.

6
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:19,906
It's about to get very very festive.

7
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:23,136
But, first I just want to
talk about all the best things

8
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:24,967
of November so let's get started.

9
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:26,947
My first favorite is a beauty product.

10
00:00:26,947 --> 00:00:29,622
This is Atomy's Rose Rain Mist.

11
00:00:29,622 --> 00:00:32,415
And this has been great to use as a toner.

12
00:00:32,415 --> 00:00:35,071
I actually got this from
a subscriber in New York,

13
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:37,546
her name is Michelle and
on the note she wrote that

14
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,752
this is one of her holy
grails and it's quickly

15
00:00:39,752 --> 00:00:41,561
becoming one of mine as well.

16
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,384
And I just love the way
the mist is distributed.

17
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:48,675
It's like a really fine
cooling mist and it just

18
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,760
does a really great job
toning and hydrating.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,348
Sometimes I'll use this just
as a setting spray as well.

20
00:00:55,348 --> 00:00:58,159
When I just want my
face to look more dewy.

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:00,896
You can also spray this
on your body as well.

22
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:03,554
Naturally my skin is a little
bit on the drier side so

23
00:01:03,554 --> 00:01:06,653
this just comes in handy
when I want a refresher.

24
00:01:06,653 --> 00:01:09,179
Next up I've got another beauty product.

25
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,699
I want to talk about falsies.

26
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:13,326
I have been a falsies
girl since I was 15 or 16

27
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:16,414
so there's been a lot of like
fake lashes on these eyelids.

28
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:20,427
And right now I'm kind of
in more of a natural subtle

29
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:22,388
makeup look right now.

30
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:25,398
So that's why I've been
loving these falsies by Kiss.

31
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:28,655
The two styles that I
love are Lily and Jasmine

32
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,645
and I have stocked up
on both these styles.

33
00:01:31,645 --> 00:01:34,487
These are really great if
you want more of a fresh

34
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:35,704
and innocent look.

35
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:38,546
The band is super thin so
you don't need eyeliner to

36
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:40,325
cover the band or anything.

37
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,874
It kind of reminds me of
the Ardell demi wispies

38
00:01:42,874 --> 00:01:44,076
but these are more perky.

39
00:01:44,076 --> 00:01:45,993
Sometimes with the demi wispies

40
00:01:45,993 --> 00:01:47,539
my eyes can look a little sleepy.

41
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,685
Not with these guys.

42
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:50,793
I'm wearing them on my eyes
right now and I just feel

43
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,575
just like very fresh.

44
00:01:52,575 --> 00:01:55,216
These have been great
to use when I want more

45
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,179
of like a natural look like this.

46
00:01:57,179 --> 00:01:58,425
But it's still glam.

47
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:00,874
For my book favorite I have

48
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:02,164
The War of Art by Steven Pressfield.

49
00:02:02,164 --> 00:02:04,522
This was one of the presents
that my brother got me

50
00:02:04,522 --> 00:02:05,782
for my birthday.

51
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:08,460
He said that this book
really helped him when he was

52
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:11,241
going through a creative
rut and I'm actually trying

53
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,764
to start this new creative
project and that's why

54
00:02:13,764 --> 00:02:14,843
I smashed this book out.

55
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,181
This is a very easy read.

56
00:02:16,181 --> 00:02:18,157
I finished this in a couple nights

57
00:02:18,157 --> 00:02:19,966
but I do feel re inspired.

58
00:02:19,966 --> 00:02:22,839
This book is really awesome
when you're going through

59
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:25,602
a creative block because
it just highlights the fact

60
00:02:25,602 --> 00:02:29,131
that the only thing that is
stopping you from doing a

61
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:30,709
creative project is you.

62
00:02:30,709 --> 00:02:32,187
And he calls that resistance.

63
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,646
And resistance is that
voice that tells you

64
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:36,212
to start tomorrow.

65
00:02:36,212 --> 00:02:37,933
It tells you that you're not good enough,

66
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,510
or your idea's stupid.

67
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,674
It just basically explains
that the most difficult thing

68
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:44,937
about starting a project is beginning it.

69
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,381
And it is so true.

70
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,470
I want to say that this book
wasn't like mind blowingly

71
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:52,235
good but there are definitely
parts of this book that

72
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:55,533
have me feeling inspired and
ready to start my next project.

73
00:02:55,533 --> 00:02:57,918
If you're looking for a quick
read that's gonna give you

74
00:02:57,918 --> 00:02:59,957
a kick in the butt, go check this out.

75
00:02:59,957 --> 00:03:01,779
My next favorite is a fitness one.

76
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:04,360
I recently purchased these
ankle weights on Amazon

77
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,768
and they've been incredible
for just helping me step up

78
00:03:07,768 --> 00:03:08,880
my fitness game.

79
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,204
Sometimes I just don't want
to go to the gym because

80
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:13,500
it's just kind of a hassle and
I just want to work from home

81
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,841
but I realized that I needed
to get just better equipment.

82
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:18,486
Right now I just have these
little dumbbells but they're

83
00:03:18,486 --> 00:03:20,173
just not good enough.

84
00:03:20,173 --> 00:03:22,711
I wanted to get something
where I can challenge my legs

85
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:26,360
and my butt so I got these
eight pound ankle weights.

86
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,441
I just Velcro them on to my
ankles and they have been

87
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:33,640
amazing for toning the legs
and I was using these elastic

88
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,709
bands before but these
are way more challenging.

89
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,709
I love that you can also put
them on your wrists as well

90
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,382
if you want to do some arm workouts.

91
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:44,386
You can do arm circles.

92
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:45,739
You can like punch the air like this.

93
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,930
I'm like already working
up a sweat right now but

94
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,180
these are incredible if you want to start

95
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,609
working out from home.

96
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,346
You can also just like leave
these on your ankles and

97
00:03:55,346 --> 00:03:57,974
just walk around the house
if you want just kind of like

98
00:03:57,974 --> 00:03:59,253
a no brainer workout.

99
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:01,944
I am always looking for things
that challenge my body more

100
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:03,706
and to stay fit.

101
00:04:03,706 --> 00:04:06,665
My last favorite is this green tea matcha.

102
00:04:06,665 --> 00:04:09,356
I recently got this as a
gift from my friend Regina.

103
00:04:09,356 --> 00:04:10,911
Thank you so much.

104
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,400
This has been life changing.

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,409
It's been such a great way to
get caffeine in your system.

106
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:16,945
Before with coffee,

107
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:19,612
I didn't realize how wired I get

108
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,013
and how bad the crash is from caffeine.

109
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,265
Like personally I do like the
feeling of feeling hyper awake

110
00:04:27,265 --> 00:04:28,877
and a little bit wired.

111
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,716
I don't know I just kind
of like being on edge.

112
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:33,434
But basically what
killed me was the crash.

113
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:36,246
Because after like an hour
of feeling like, I'm awake,

114
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,912
I would crash and I would
feel really really tired.

115
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,930
Um, not with this matcha.

116
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,559
It's definitely more of a gradual energy.

117
00:04:43,559 --> 00:04:45,232
Kind of like slow release.

118
00:04:45,232 --> 00:04:47,848
So it just comes up and
it gently comes down.

119
00:04:47,848 --> 00:04:49,548
It's just very nice.

120
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,522
I feel like this is just
better for your body.

121
00:04:51,522 --> 00:04:53,331
It's also very relaxing to make.

122
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:56,679
You get your little sifter,
you sift out all the

123
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:59,095
little clumps and then you add hot water.

124
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:01,890
Personally, I like to add
ice because I just like

125
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,160
iced drinks so I make like
a really delicious matcha

126
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,926
iced drink and it is just
so tasty and gives me

127
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:10,846
the energy that I need.

128
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:14,066
I know matcha is having a huge
moment in New York and LA so

129
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm so happy that it's in the
comfort of my own home now.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,432
Alright guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites.

131
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:22,488
If you'd like to share anything
that you were inspired by

132
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,162
or loved please write it
in the comments down below.

133
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:28,645
I'm trying to think if I
have any updates for you.

134
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,912
The wedding planning is going.

135
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:34,096
I'm not gonna lie it's
been pretty stressful.

136
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:38,054
It's just a lot of like
small like details but we are

137
00:05:38,054 --> 00:05:40,014
having our cake test tasting

138
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:41,927
this week which I'm really excited about.

139
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:46,504
There's still no like wedding
dress that I really like yet.

140
00:05:46,504 --> 00:05:50,274
It's kind of weird because
last time I went wedding dress

141
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:52,669
shopping it just felt like
very bizarre like a lot of the

142
00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:55,239
dresses it felt like someone
just copied and pasted my face

143
00:05:55,239 --> 00:05:57,675
on these dresses and I just
feel like that's a sign that

144
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:59,861
I haven't found the dress that I love yet.

145
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:01,625
But yes, the search continues.

146
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,029
Then my brother and I are also going to

147
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:05,594
New Orleans next week.

148
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:06,820
I am so excited.

149
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,897
If you guys have any
recommendations on what to do there

150
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:12,420
please write it in the
comments down below.

151
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,551
From food to drink to just entertainment.

152
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:16,675
I would love to know
like a local's thoughts.

153
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:19,490
But yeah, I want to thank
you guys so much for watching

154
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,203
and I'll see you guys in the next one.

155
00:06:21,203 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, muah.
