00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:05,430
- Hi, everyone!

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:06,371
It's your girl, Jenn.

3
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:08,761
And today, I am doing a
really fun styling video.

4
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:11,689
Since it's finally starting
to get cold around here,

5
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:13,871
I thought I would bust out
some of my outerwear pieces

6
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:16,140
and show you guys how I style them.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,270
I am so happy to announce that I have

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,099
partnered with Nordstrom Rack
who is sponsoring this video.

9
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:23,250
They have such a great
selection of outerwear,

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,888
so it was really fun
getting to make this video.

11
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:28,429
I also filmed a video on
their YouTube channel,

12
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,031
so make sure you check that
out after you watch mine.

13
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,514
But for this video, I
am styling three looks,

14
00:00:33,514 --> 00:00:34,954
so let's get started.

15
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:37,376
The first coat I'm styling
is the puffer coat.

16
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,464
Puffer coats are
notorious for being bulky,

17
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:41,477
but that's why I decided to choose one

18
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:43,094
that's more elongated.

19
00:00:43,094 --> 00:00:45,367
I love that this is in
a neutral olive shade,

20
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:48,373
so it's really easy to pair
with anything in my closet.

21
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,899
I went ahead and styled it
with a gray turtleneck sweater,

22
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,486
and then I streamlined with
some simple, black skinnies

23
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,542
for something chic and classic.

24
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,632
For shoes, I'm wearing
some classic black boots.

25
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:00,328
And then I wore a beanie
to cover up any bedhead.

26
00:01:00,328 --> 00:01:02,868
I think this is a really
great, everyday jacket

27
00:01:02,868 --> 00:01:05,960
that you can rock to school or
running errands around town.

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,470
Nordstrom Rock has a ton
of amazing puffer options,

29
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,255
so make sure you check it out.

30
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:13,372
This next outfit is how I
would rock a faux fur coat.

31
00:01:13,372 --> 00:01:15,447
I found this color one at Nordstrom Rack,

32
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:17,321
and I love that it's reversible.

33
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:19,592
So it's like you're
getting two coats in one.

34
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:22,586
Since the coat is on the
more extravagant side,

35
00:01:22,586 --> 00:01:24,306
I'm going to show you how I rock this baby

36
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:26,244
in the evening for a date night look.

37
00:01:26,244 --> 00:01:27,557
I popped on the coat, and I'm showing off

38
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:29,694
the white faux fur side.

39
00:01:29,694 --> 00:01:32,162
I feel like it gives off a more chic,

40
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,815
winter wonderland vibe.

41
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:35,828
Underneath, I'm wearing a cute, lace dress

42
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,691
and then paired it with
some over-the-knee boots

43
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:39,316
for a cozy winter feel.

44
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,614
This is a great look to wear to a concert

45
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,060
or even a nice dinner.

46
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,632
I also styled these boots over at

47
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:46,735
the Nordstrom Rack
channel, so if you'd like

48
00:01:46,735 --> 00:01:48,259
to get more ideas on how to style it,

49
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:49,656
definitely go check it out.

50
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,307
I'll leave it in the cards
and the description box.

51
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:53,664
The next coat is perfect for those

52
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,548
who are traveling for the holidays.

53
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,733
I highly recommend getting a bomber jacket

54
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,838
because they're so multifaceted

55
00:01:59,838 --> 00:02:02,157
and can be worn for so many occasions.

56
00:02:02,157 --> 00:02:04,146
Here I have this really
sick, black bomber.

57
00:02:04,146 --> 00:02:05,679
It's so comfortable, and it has

58
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,393
this cool graphic on the back.

59
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:08,792
So this is how I styled the bomber

60
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,084
to wear at the airport.

61
00:02:10,084 --> 00:02:12,549
I paired the jacket with a comfy hoodie

62
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,633
and some sweats.

63
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,385
This is like a really chilled out look,

64
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,576
and it's insanely comfortable.

65
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:18,794
So that way, you can travel in leisure.

66
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:21,862
Now here is how I wear the
bomber for the evening.

67
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:24,746
I paired it with a patterned,
over-the-shoulder top

68
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:26,328
and my navy disco pants.

69
00:02:26,328 --> 00:02:28,457
This is a flashy ensemble you can wear

70
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,953
to a house party or drinks with the girls.

71
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,862
So, yeah, that's why I
love bombers so much.

72
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,545
They're light-weight, easy to pack,

73
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,955
and really go with any occasion.

74
00:02:36,955 --> 00:02:38,582
All right, guys, those
are my three outfits

75
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:40,436
featuring outerwear pieces.

76
00:02:40,436 --> 00:02:41,993
If you'd like more fashion inspiration,

77
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:44,040
head on over to Nordstrom
Rack's YouTube channel.

78
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,500
I filmed something on there.

79
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,322
I will leave a link in
the description box,

80
00:02:47,322 --> 00:02:48,985
so please check it out.

81
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:51,593
You can also shop similar
styles on Nordstrom Rack.

82
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:54,247

86
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,876

00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,197
in the comments down below.

88
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:05,232
I love reading what you guys have to say.

89
00:03:05,232 --> 00:03:07,028

90
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:08,845

91

Bye!
