1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:03,466
(instrumental music)

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,296
- Happy November First, yay!

3
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:09,129
- Yeah.

4
00:00:10,334 --> 00:00:12,028
- I always love the first of the month.

5
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:14,778
It feels like a chance
to restart everything.

6
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:18,350
Ben and I are on our way to Catch LA.

7
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,081
We are going to the
Revolve nominee brunch,

8
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:22,725
and that's gonna be really
exciting because we're

9
00:00:22,725 --> 00:00:25,659
gonna be reunited with our Revolve family.

10
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:26,786
- That's perfect, isn't it?

11
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:29,758
We go to Catch LA, which is so so good.

12
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,762
We went there a couple of weeks ago,

13
00:00:31,762 --> 00:00:34,169
unbelievable, and we get
to see the Revolve crew,

14
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:35,437
so, good day.

15
00:00:35,437 --> 00:00:36,522
- It's gonna be cool.

16
00:00:36,522 --> 00:00:39,123
It's their first time
doing an awards show,

17
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,204
and I know it's gonna be good

18
00:00:40,204 --> 00:00:41,877
because they don't half-ass anything.

19
00:00:41,877 --> 00:00:42,890
- Nothing.

20
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,307
(soft music)

21
00:00:57,184 --> 00:00:59,235
- [Jenn] We have a very special delivery.

22
00:00:59,235 --> 00:01:01,322
- Yes, we got a nice new TV.

23
00:01:01,322 --> 00:01:02,437
It's pretty big.

24
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,441
- [Jenn] Yeah, it's fricking massive.

25
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:07,316
This has been a long time coming.

26
00:01:07,316 --> 00:01:09,649
We got a whomping 65 inches.

27
00:01:11,828 --> 00:01:13,102
Chipper, what do you think?

28
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:16,508
- [Ben] What do you think, Chips?

29
00:01:16,508 --> 00:01:19,883
- [Jenn] Well, the TV
had a big crack in it,

30
00:01:19,883 --> 00:01:21,563
so we had to put it back.

31
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:22,440
- It was really good actually.

32
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,676
We got it out, we set it up,

33
00:01:23,676 --> 00:01:26,561
I screwed everything really
tight into the stand.

34
00:01:26,561 --> 00:01:28,331
Got it up, put the other TV upstairs,

35
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:30,540
woo hoo, here we go, Stranger Things.

36
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,492
There's a crack on it, so,

37
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,484
it took me about an hour
trying to drill this out,

38
00:01:34,484 --> 00:01:36,554
because it's one of those that you can't

39
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,241
really reverse it very well.

40
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:40,350
So it's been really fun,
and the best thing about it,

41
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,786
they can't come pick it up and exchange it

42
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,118
because they don't have any more.

43
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:44,951
So, yeah, that's that.

44
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:49,305
- Oh my gosh, you can't
really see on camera,

45
00:01:49,305 --> 00:01:51,931
but the clouds are looking
very ominous right now,

46
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,903
but kinda hopeful as well.

47
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:55,247
Hello, everybody.

48
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,654
Please excuse the messy office.

49
00:01:57,654 --> 00:01:59,695
The reason why all
these trash bags are out

50
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,910
is because tomorrow I am shooting

51
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,371
the second drop for the Eggie Collection.

52
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:06,992
I'm so excited to be doing
that because, believe me,

53
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:09,370
it has been an entire process.

54
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,538
A lotta things go into it.

55
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:12,387
There's a lotta logistics.

56
00:02:12,387 --> 00:02:13,958
Samples weren't on time.

57
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,415
Some samples weren't like, acceptable,

58
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:18,341
so yeah, things just get pushed back,

59
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:19,928
but it's all right, I'm so happy that

60
00:02:19,928 --> 00:02:22,127
we're getting closer
and closer to the date.

61
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:23,916
The reason why I'm in such a fancy outfit

62
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,622
is because I am going to
the Revolve Awards tonight.

63
00:02:26,622 --> 00:02:29,347
Yesterday was the brunch, but
tonight is the actual thing.

64
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:30,844
I am wearing a Maijerel.

65
00:02:30,844 --> 00:02:33,803
It's this gorgeous, fleecy number.

66
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:36,812
And then, I'm gonna throw
a big faux fur coat on.

67
00:02:36,812 --> 00:02:39,716
(upbeat music)

68
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,361
- Let's go.

69
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,944
(upbeat music)

70
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:55,397
- Welcome to the
first-ever Revolve Awards.

71
00:02:55,397 --> 00:02:57,307
Give it up for yourselves.

72
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:58,753
(cheering)

73
00:02:58,753 --> 00:02:59,952
- I'm honored to be here to present

74
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,702
the best beauty influencer award.

75
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:07,627
And the award for best
beauty influencer goes to

76
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:08,520
Jenn Im.

77
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,770
(cheering)

78
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:15,057
- First off, I need to
thank my subscribers

79
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:18,352
for voting for me, and I really don't know

80
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:21,745
what I did to deserve such
loyalty from my Eggies,

81
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,009
and I wanna thank you so much.

82
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:26,091
It's crazy to win an award like this,

83
00:03:26,091 --> 00:03:29,247
because growing up, there
weren't that many people

84
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:31,898
that looked like me in traditional media.

85
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:34,256
I am a short Asian chick,

86
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:38,685
and you know, in the 1990s,
there was not that image

87
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:42,368
on the screen, and through
YouTube I was able to build

88
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:45,029
a platform and just showcase what I loved,

89
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:47,021
which was fashion, beauty, style,

90
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,961
just feeling good about yourself.

91
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:52,110
And I wanna thank,
obviously, my subscribers,

92
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,561
my frickin' manager.

93
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:55,394
Love you.

94
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,085
Ben, my fiancee.

95
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:02,692
You have seen me through thick and thin,

96
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:04,313
and I wanna thank Revolve.

97
00:04:04,313 --> 00:04:07,557
Like you guys believed in us,
and I wanna thank you guys

98
00:04:07,557 --> 00:04:10,955
for creating such surreal moments for us.

99
00:04:10,955 --> 00:04:13,410
It's all about having a
good time and celebrating,

100
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,141
and I'm down for that.

101
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,519
(cheering)

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,019
Thank you so much.

103
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:22,230
- [Man] Her speech was good.

104
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,470
Dude, that was so good.

105
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,967
- We're on our second award of the night,

106
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,704
and we're on three fucks already.

107
00:04:26,704 --> 00:04:27,719
(laughter)

108
00:04:27,719 --> 00:04:29,646
I had no idea that was
gonna come from her.

109
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:33,170
She's like, as a young
Asian woman in the industry,

110
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,431
I fuckin' love you all.

111
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:37,014
(upbeat music)

112
00:04:46,955 --> 00:04:48,699
- You know my beautiful manager,

113
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:52,371
and my best friend, the villa sisters.

114
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:55,705
- Congratulations, Influencer of the Year.

115
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:58,288
(upbeat music)

116
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:05,825
(soft music)

117
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,897
- Good morning, we are here

118
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:11,509
at the cabin.

119
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:12,766
I am getting ready right now.

120
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:15,410
I've got Amy right over there, hello.

121
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,993
We've got Jeff, hi.

122
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:20,298
It's behind the scenes of the Eggie team.

123
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:22,243
And then there's Ted, of course.

124
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:25,727
Yeah, so I'm just doing
my makeup right now.

125
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:28,453
And then Adam and Mitchell
should be here soon.

126
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,430
And yeah, trying to knock out

127
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,221
this whole shoot by four,

128
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,304
so really gotta hurry up.

129
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:38,680
All right, so the crew
is starting to roll in.

130
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,221
There's Adam, the
photographer, I love him.

131
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,555
There's Jen, another Jen, from the house.

132
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,390
Obviously Ben and Wa over there.

133
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,568
Wa is filming the editorial
look book, along with Ben.

134
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:51,496
And the makeup is done.

135
00:05:51,496 --> 00:05:53,030
I'm gonna take you downstairs with me.

136
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,737
It's a little dark, but I'll show you.

137
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,502
Here, got Mitchell, oh,

138
00:05:57,502 --> 00:06:00,333
also creating content, hello.

139
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,518
We have taken over the foosball room.

140
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:04,405
Gonna make some hair magic in here.

141
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,157
Amy, oh there you are.

142
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,038
- [Amy] Hello, hello.

143
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:11,893
- Steaming, organizing, she is incredible.

144
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,126
And, we are ready to go.

145
00:06:14,126 --> 00:06:15,304
Let's do this.

146
00:06:15,304 --> 00:06:17,887
(upbeat music)

147
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,220
- [Ben] Done, is that a wrap?

148
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,053
Yeah.

149
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,533
Yeah.

150
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,535
- Are you excited to
see your grandparents?

151
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,134
Chippo.

152
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:49,634
Okay, she's ready.

153
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,795
(car beeping)

154
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:09,612
Okay, now up.

155
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:12,524
Yay!

156
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:16,692
10 seconds, 10, nine,

157
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:18,135
eight,

158
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:19,110
seven.

159
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,457
(laughter)

160
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:24,040
(upbeat music)

161
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:38,801
- It's so perfect.

162
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:39,832
- [Jenn] I know, it looks so perfect.

163
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:40,823
It looks like a set.

164
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,622
- Oh my God, it does.

165
00:07:42,622 --> 00:07:44,618
- [Jenn] It's really dark,
but Emily has accepted

166
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:47,288
my bridesmaid proposal.

167
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,843
- I said yes.

168
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,276
- Thank God.

169
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:53,683
So it is Tuesday now, my hair is darker.

170
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:57,364
Pretty slightly, maybe
like two shades darker.

171
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:59,984
Anna just gave me a glossing and toned it

172
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:02,818
and did my base, and I am
obsessed with the way it looks.

173
00:08:02,818 --> 00:08:04,392
I mean, I just need to
brush it out right now.

174
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:05,663
I just woke up.

175
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:06,651
What is going on today?

176
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:08,622
Today is a day of editing.

177
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:11,277
I'm trying to get out
my October favorites,

178
00:08:11,277 --> 00:08:13,665
and then also finishing
up a bunch of videos

179
00:08:13,665 --> 00:08:16,220
for a deadline tomorrow.

180
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,460
And I'm also filming with,

181
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,515
To the Nines, Amy, Drew,
Scott and Karen today,

182
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:23,892
or I guess tonight.

183
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:25,861
We're gonna do like a night out look book,

184
00:08:25,861 --> 00:08:28,176
so that's gonna be really fun.

185
00:08:28,176 --> 00:08:30,505
It's really cool doing like
collaborative look books

186
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:32,198
because we only need to wear one outfit

187
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:33,655
and then we've got like six,

188
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:36,395
so I'm very very happy for that.

189
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:39,001
I'm just trying to get as
much stuff done as possible

190
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,924
before I go to Toronto on Thursday.

191
00:08:40,924 --> 00:08:43,613
I am so excited for that trip.

192
00:08:43,614 --> 00:08:46,110
I'm going for my friend Dani's birthday,

193
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,557
and I just got her
birthday gift right now.

194
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:50,521
I'm getting her a Kindle.

195
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,445
After I filmed my favorites,
and I was like raving

196
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,442
about my Kindle Light, I was like,

197
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,718
I should probably just like get people,

198
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,348
or get like my loved ones a Kindle,

199
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:02,618
because it just makes
reading so much more fun.

200
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:03,502
Yeah, I can see your screen.

201
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,669
- [Woman] Yeah, it says Eggie dot web.

202
00:09:08,084 --> 00:09:10,904
- [Jenn] Leo has cooked
his famous El Pastore.

203
00:09:10,904 --> 00:09:12,548
I'm at Karen and Leo's place.

204
00:09:12,548 --> 00:09:13,422
- Hi.

205
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,594
- [Jenn] Oh my gosh, look
at this bountiful feast.

206
00:09:15,594 --> 00:09:18,011
(chattering)

207
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,836
- [Leo] It's like this is your canvas.

208
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:25,086
These are the paint colors.

209
00:09:39,491 --> 00:09:41,674
(laughing)

210
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,030
- [Jenn] We got all this camera equipment.

211
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,783
Adrian came very prepared.

212
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,186
Thank you very much.

213
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:47,534
- I have two.

214
00:09:47,534 --> 00:09:49,028
- [Jenn] Do you wanna say something?

215
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:50,804
- Do I wanna say something?

216
00:09:50,804 --> 00:09:53,212
- [Jenn] Everyone's in their
beautiful night out outfits.

217
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,534
We should go somewhere after this.

218
00:09:55,534 --> 00:09:56,776
I can't believe we're just gonna do this

219
00:09:56,776 --> 00:09:58,311
and like go home after.

220
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,153
Everyone's looking really fly.

221
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:01,907
- Perhaps Drew's friend's birthday party.

222
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,742
- [Jenn] Oh yeah, Momma Shelter.

223
00:10:04,742 --> 00:10:06,659
- Momma Shelter, mommy.

224
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:11,531
- All right, doing my dress
fitting with my girls.

225
00:10:11,531 --> 00:10:12,863
Maid of honor and my bridesmaids.

226
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,593
Oh, before I forget,

227
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,760
oh wait, okay.

228
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:19,841
All right, this one is for

229
00:10:20,725 --> 00:10:21,558
Ashley.

230
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,203
- Wow, I love presents.

231
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:26,628
- [Jenn] And this one is for you.

232
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,795
I wonder what it could be.

233
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,839
- Oh, I love it.

234
00:10:35,557 --> 00:10:37,940
- [Jenn] Yeah, it's so minimal.

235
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,557
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

236
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,739
- Oh my gosh, my favorite
sisters in the world.

237
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,906
(gasping)

238
00:10:45,055 --> 00:10:46,027
Cute.

239
00:10:46,027 --> 00:10:47,281
- Actually, that's really gorgeous.

240
00:10:47,281 --> 00:10:48,948
- [Camerawoman] Wow.

241
00:10:50,013 --> 00:10:50,846
Ooh.

242
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,243
Oh my God.

243
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,487
So this is the separates one?

244
00:10:58,487 --> 00:10:59,688
- Yeah, it's a bodice.

245
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,355
- [Camerawoman] Wow.

246
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,903
That one is beautiful.

247
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,401
I love the little ties on the sleeves.

248
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:07,667
- [Saleswoman] The
little scallops on there

249
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,571
are made to measure,

250
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:10,629
so it would be your proportions,

251
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,677
which is really great
since you're so petite.

252
00:11:12,677 --> 00:11:14,591
- This is serious stuff, y'all.

253
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,508
- [Camerawoman] Yeah, look at that.

254
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:19,646
Wow.

255
00:11:22,155 --> 00:11:24,139
That one is beautiful.

256
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,497
I know we say that for every single one,

257
00:11:25,497 --> 00:11:26,580
but this one.

258
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:28,722
I love it.

259
00:11:29,758 --> 00:11:31,627
- It's very wow factor.

260
00:11:31,627 --> 00:11:32,669
- Yeah.

261
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:35,666
- This is hands-down my
favorite gown of hers.

262
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:37,137
I'm gonna layer a little bit.

263
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,370
- Long.

264
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,420
- [Camerawoman] Not the one.

265
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,438
- It's so big on her
that, even if I clip it.

266
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:46,108
Even clipped it's just like hanging off.

267
00:11:46,108 --> 00:11:47,991
- [Camerawoman] I totally understand

268
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:48,824
the sleeve thing now.

269
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:49,657
You have to be like

270
00:11:49,657 --> 00:11:50,602
six feet tall to wear that.

271
00:11:50,602 --> 00:11:51,441
- Yeah.

272
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,754
And like the arms, I feel like.

273
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:53,587
- [Camerawoman] Yeah, it's just heavy.

274
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,420
- [Saleswoman] It's like you're playing

275
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,253
dress-up or something.

276
00:11:55,253 --> 00:11:56,086
- Yeah.

277
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,336
(laughing)

278
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:01,753
(chattering)

279
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,126
(soft music)

280
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,268
- Hi, everybody, oh God.

281
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,590
Amy and Jenn here.

282
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,618
If you guys don't know
who Amy is, here she is.

283
00:12:41,618 --> 00:12:43,998
I talk about her in my favorites a lot.

284
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:45,545
- Yes, the one and only.

285
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:47,536
I'm holding the camera for Jenn,

286
00:12:47,536 --> 00:12:48,993
because no tripod.

287
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:49,987
- Yeah, it keeps falling.

288
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,820
We are on our way to Sherman Oaks.

289
00:12:54,115 --> 00:12:58,084
But we just got back
from the Eggie spring,

290
00:12:58,084 --> 00:13:00,611
I guess that would be
like drop three meeting.

291
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:02,351
Or drop four actually.

292
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,896
There's a lotta stuff
in store for you guys.

293
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:06,058
There's the winter,
spring and also summer.

294
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:08,041
It just never stops, but I'm so excited

295
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,523
to show it to you guys when it's ready.

296
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,459
Oh my gosh, I look like a hot mess.

297
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,238
Because I feel like a hot mess.

298
00:13:15,238 --> 00:13:16,655
Today's been one of those days

299
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:20,355
where it feels so
rewarding just to sit down

300
00:13:20,355 --> 00:13:22,540
and not have to do anything.

301
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,040
Definitely did the most today.

302
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,468
I've got my kimchi-jiigae here.

303
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:33,673
This is the best kimchi-jiigae
of all time, I must say.

304
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:35,946
I wish I could just learn how
to make it exactly like this.

305
00:13:35,946 --> 00:13:39,283
I went them to tell me like,
where they buy their kimchi.

306
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:41,330
Like what the measurements are,

307
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,189
because this would be phenomenal to cook

308
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,755
and I'd probably save a lot of money

309
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,553
if I just made it myself.

310
00:13:47,553 --> 00:13:51,020
But yeah, today was so
amazing and productive,

311
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,406
and just exhausting.

312
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,215
Yeah, I feel like I
haven't even gotten to chat

313
00:13:54,215 --> 00:13:56,212
about like my Toronto trip.

314
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,417
When I was out there, I didn't vlog.

315
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,055
I started to, and then,

316
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:02,949
first of all, it was
just too cold to vlog.

317
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,557
When it's freezing, it's
just like, not ideal to like,

318
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,617
take something out and have, you know,

319
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:09,101
equipment to fumble around with,

320
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:10,937
so I wasn't able to vlog there.

321
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,093
But it was actually good
that I got three days

322
00:14:13,093 --> 00:14:16,659
just to myself, I was still
working but not filming.

323
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,991
So I'm really happy
that it was productive,

324
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,575
but also restful as well.

325
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:22,359
Sophie's gonna come later.

326
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,872
I haven't seen her in like a couple weeks.

327
00:14:23,872 --> 00:14:26,126
But, yeah, we've both been frickin' busy,

328
00:14:26,126 --> 00:14:27,410
so it's gonna be awesome to get some

329
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,734
one-on-one time with her.

330
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,371
You guys, how funny is this?

331
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:33,465
I'm in like the exact
same spot as last night.

332
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:36,059
But yeah, it's the next morning,

333
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:39,380
and it is the day of Eggie drop two.

334
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,850
It is one p.m., and it's
been a couple hours,

335
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,066
and the support has been incredible.

336
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:47,842
Can't wait to see how all the
pieces look like on you guys.

337
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:50,968
If you happen to support,
and you receive your items

338
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,581
and you love it, and you take a photo,

339
00:14:52,581 --> 00:14:54,831
please tag us at EggieShop.

340
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:57,743
I love seeing you guys rock Eggie,

341
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,334
and it makes me so happy.

342
00:14:59,334 --> 00:15:01,278
That is probably the
most like rewarding thing

343
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:03,593
that can possibly happen.

344
00:15:03,593 --> 00:15:08,538
But yeah, unfortunately, I
think I'm getting a cold.

345
00:15:08,538 --> 00:15:10,185
I feel like I've been
fighting off this cold

346
00:15:10,185 --> 00:15:11,844
for the past like two weeks,

347
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,157
but I feel like my immune
system's pretty strong,

348
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:15,655
but yesterday when Sophie came over,

349
00:15:15,655 --> 00:15:17,710
and we literally talked
for like five hours.

350
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,972
So my throat feels so hoarse right now.

351
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:23,544
I think I'm just gonna
probably end the vlog here,

352
00:15:23,544 --> 00:15:27,701
and then start part two of
November later on today.

353
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,574
So yeah, I just wanted to thank you guys

354
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:33,358
so much for watching and
supporting my channel.

355
00:15:33,358 --> 00:15:34,573
I feel like,

356
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:36,171
I feel like November has already been

357
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:38,107
such an amazing month.

358
00:15:38,107 --> 00:15:41,390
And I can't believe that
next week is Thanksgiving,

359
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,377
so we're really plowing through this year.

360
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,839
So yeah, I wanna thank you
guys so much for watching.

361
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,255
And I'll see you guys
in the next one, bye.
