1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,793
(lively music)

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:05,970
- Hi everyone.

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:07,060
Happy New Year!

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,490
It's your girl Jenn.

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,030
And today I am just finishing up

6
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,060
some loose ends from 2017.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,930
I'm going to be talking
about my December favorites.

8
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,910
I'm really happy to do this because once

9
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:19,470
I film this and edit this,

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,910
that means I have done every monthly

11
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,430
favorite of 2017 and that
makes me feel really good.

12
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,940
I like to complete things.

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:29,340
So, yeah even though this
video is a little late,

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,070
I thought I'd do it anyway.

15
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,860
This month we've got a
lot of film favorites.

16
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:36,430
We've got a book, we've
got a fashion and a beauty.

17
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,090
So let's just dive right in.

18
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,090
I want to start with a
fashion favorite first,

19
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:43,630
here I have these mismatched
earrings from Pomelo.

20
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,000
I believe I first showed
them to you guys in

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,720
my first and only episode of jungle bells.

22
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,560
I rocked them in New
Orleans and I got a ton

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,780
of comments asking where they were from,

24
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:54,460
so I had to put them in this video.

25
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,970
One of the earrings has this cool

26
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,840
silver bar and the other has a pearl.

27
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,490
And I love pairing
these with really simple

28
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,960
and basic outfits because
it instantly gives

29
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,470
that outfit a quirk.

30
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,750
I'm a huge fan of dangly
earrings, as you can tell

31
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:09,890
and these guys are no exception.

32
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,660
Moving on straight into a book favorite.

33
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,580
I have The Four Agreements
by Don Miguel Ruiz.

34
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,230
And this book came to me at such a

35
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,490
perfect time in my life.

36
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,750
It was actually recommended to me

37
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,820
by two of my friends,
Amy Lee and Anna Lee,

38
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,430
no they're not related.

39
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:27,350
But this book just really changed the way

40
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,720
I look at life and I feel like these

41
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,300
days I've been really reading a lot of

42
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,070
self-improvement books, but I feel like

43
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,968
they've really helped me
develop who I am today.

44
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:39,870
So this book teaches you
four agreements, or rules,

45
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,690
that you should always apply in your life

46
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,900
in order for you to
have just like a fuller

47
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,920
and more peaceful life.

48
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,930
So the first rule is to be
impeccable with your word.

49
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,891
It basically says that what you say

50
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:54,320
actually means a lot.

51
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,130
So be mindful of it.

52
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,960
The second agreement is to
never take anything personally.

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,150
And this rule really
resonated with me because

54
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,210
I am a very sensitive person and I take a

55
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,280
lot of things to heart.

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,940
And so when you retrain
your mind to realize

57
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,729
that nothing anyone
does is because of you.

58
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,870
It's because of themselves.

59
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,620
Even if someone insults
you or is rude to you,

60
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,030
know that it's not because of you,

61
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,510
it's because of themselves

62
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,490
and the rules that they've
made in their own head.

63
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,410
And I know it kinda doesn't
make sense right now,

64
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,320
but I swear when you read that chapter,

65
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,460
it will be crystal clear.

66
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,290
The third rule is to
never make assumptions.

67
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,700
Because when you assume,
it creates complicated

68
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,250
situations and it says to never be

69
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,690
afraid to ask questions.

70
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,400
If you're confused, don't assume.

71
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,530
Just ask directly.

72
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,170
And I feel like that's something that

73
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:43,770
I struggled with because sometimes

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,460
I don't wanna bother
anyone with my questions,

75
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,410
but when you ask someone
directly what they mean,

76
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,920
or to clarify something, it removes the

77
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,880
possibility of a disagreement.

78
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,230
And so yeah, it says
to always ask questions

79
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,380
and to never assume.

80
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,960
And the last agreement is
to always try your best.

81
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,350
And I love this agreement so much because

82
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:04,490
I don't really like to half-ass anything,

83
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,680
I like to put everything
into whatever I'm doing.

84
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,940
Whether I'm washing the dishes,

85
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,020
whether I am working on a video.

86
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,300
I feel like this is something
that everyone can apply.

87
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,830
And I know that even if I
mess up or I don't follow

88
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,470
the rest of the agreement as perfectly,

89
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,060
as long as I know I'm trying my best

90
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,500
and I'm improving a little
bit by bit everyday,

91
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,740
that shows for something
at the end of the road.

92
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,150
So yeah that was a little
skeleton of the book.

93
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,240
I highly recommend you
actually go read it though,

94
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,440
because I find that the agreements sink in

95
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,550
much more that way.

96
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,420
And also the way he writes isn't like

97
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,210
flowery and confusing, he writes in a very

98
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,020
crystal clear direct way.

99
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,730
So it can really hit home for anybody.

100
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,650
So I saw multiple movies this month

101
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,140
and to my surprise I have loved every one

102
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,300
single one that I saw.

103
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,808
So the first one I want to talk about

104
00:03:53,808 --> 00:03:56,260
is The Disaster Artist
and it has James Franco,

105
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,220
Dave Franco and Seth
Rogan and like a bunch

106
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,140
of other people, but it's essentially

107
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,760
a movie based on a movie.

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,610
And it shows you how
they created The Room,

109
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:10,030
which is notoriously
known for the greatest

110
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,450
worst film of all time.

111
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,500
The movie was incredible and it actually

112
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,740
propelled me to watch The Room.

113
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,990
And I think they're an
amazing pairing together.

114
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,660
You've got to watch both of them.

115
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,170
And if you actually enjoy The Room,

116
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,770
you and I will have
some sort of connection

117
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,530
because it's one of those movies where you

118
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,740
freaking love it or you're just confused

119
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,410
and you just want to stop it.

120
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,980
But The Disaster Artist,

121
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,679
it really helps you see how bizarre

122
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:41,050
and passionate Tommy Wiseau is.

123
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,350
He is a character for sure.

124
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,470
And I feel like James Franco

125
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,000
really did an amazing,
like representation of him.

126
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,233
It's incredible.

127
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:52,990
And it just shows you that you know,

128
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,440
even if you're a little crazy,

129
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,080
as long as you like believe in something

130
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,780
and you put your all in something,

131
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,580
you may get recognized for it

132
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,750
and it's really inspiring
at the end of the day.

133
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,017
I love both movies and
I feel like you should

134
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:07,290
watch The Disaster Artist first

135
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,820
and then The Room because it will just

136
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,218
make The Room even funnier,
so go check it out.

137
00:05:11,218 --> 00:05:13,980
My next film favorite is called Ladybird

138
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,750
and I also saw this in theaters

139
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,130
and I freaking loved it.

140
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,690
So this is about a teenage
girl named Christine

141
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,490
and she's a senior in high school,

142
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,190
it's her last year so you just kind of

143
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,920
see what she gets into.

144
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,650
This movie is really
about her relationships

145
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,910
with everyone in her life,

146
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,860
like her mom, her best friend,

147
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,990
the guys that she dates, like the way she

148
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,620
feels about college applications.

149
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:38,030
And I cried twice during this movie,

150
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,099
like one because of sadness

151
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:41,580
and one 'cause of happiness.

152
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,170
And I love movies that really

153
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,280
take you on a roller coaster.

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,450
Like it's not like an action film,

155
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,210
it's like more of a hyper realistic film

156
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,230
where you can truly see
yourself as Christine.

157
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:54,450
And I feel like it really hit home for me

158
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,110
because, like she and I kind of had like

159
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,870
a very similar high school experience

160
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,280
and so it really resurfaced all these

161
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,330
like old memories and feelings and after

162
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,560
I left, I felt very reflective and

163
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,990
I also felt like a sense of pride

164
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:13,180
because I've come such a long ways

165
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,280
since my awkward days.

166
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,290
I highly recommend it.

167
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,480
If you kind of grew up
around the early 2000s,

168
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,850
because it is so nostalgic.

169
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,760
And it's one of those films where you

170
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,010
forget you're watching a film

171
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,100
because you're so
invested in the characters

172
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,650
and you really see
yourself in all of them.

173
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,079
So yeah, go check it out.

174
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,820
In December, I colored my hair darker

175
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,490
and I freaking love it.

176
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,110
I feel like a new woman.

177
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,720
But with darker hair comes like the

178
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,960
visibility of dandruff,

179
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,910
so I knew I had to you know take

180
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,140
matters into my own hands.

181
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,690
So I got this shampoo by Briogeo.

182
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,970
It is their scalp revival one.

183
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,980
It comes in a tub, which
kind of tripped me out,

184
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,280
but yeah you just basically scoop

185
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,860
up the shampoo, you rub it in your head

186
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,430
and the little exfoliants
inside the shampoo,

187
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,440
it like exfoliates your
scalp and because of that,

188
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,460
you have no dandruff.

189
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,300
And it has been amazing to use.

190
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,220
I love the way it smells.

191
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,400
It smells like Lush's mask of magnaminty.

192
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,620
So yeah it smells good,
it cleanses my hair

193
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,610
and I am dandruff free.

194
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,810
Lastly, I wanted to show
Ben's Christmas present to me.

195
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,500
He got me this gorgeous plant from Sanso

196
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,350
and I'm obsessed with it.

197
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,330
I feel like it really breeds in life

198
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,820
to the living room, it
really grounds the space.

199
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,670
I love the colors, I love
the way it branches out,

200
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,770
I love the pot, it's stunning.

201
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:36,020
And right now, I don't
know what to name her,

202
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,350
so if you guys can tell
me what kind of names

203
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,740
you think I could give
her, please write it

204
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,306
in the comments down below,
I would love to hear.

205
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:46,750
All right guys, that is a
wrap on my December favorites,

206
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,060
it would mean the world to me if you

207
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,920
wrote down what you were inspired by

208
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,810
or what you loved or something good

209
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,530
that happened to you in
the comments down below,

210
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,720
I truly love reading what you guys

211
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,730
have to say and I try my best to answer

212
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,490
as many as I can.

213
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,230
So yeah, feel free to drop some love down.

214
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,700
By the time you're watching this,

215
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,560
I will be in Thailand with Ben

216
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,220
and I am so excited.

217
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,660
I've never traveled there with him

218
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,450
so it will be an adventure for us.

219
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,450
We will definitely be vlogging.

220
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm gonna try my best
to vlog all of January

221
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,530
because December I just kind of fell off,

222
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,520
like I was supposed to
have two jungle bells

223
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,080
episodes, but by the
second half of December I

224
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,610
just kind of wanted to take a little break

225
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,360
from vlogging, I was still uploading,

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,530
but I just didn't feel
it necessary to vlog,

227
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,270
you know everything like that.

228
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:35,179
But, I don't know why I'm
like trying to justify this.

229
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:38,509
Regardless, prepare for
more vlogs this January.

230
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,179
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching

231
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,317
and I'll see you guys in the next one.

232
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:44,804
Bye (kisses).

233
00:08:44,804 --> 00:00:00,000
(lively music)
