1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:02,718
(jazz music)

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:05,322
- Hey, everyone!

3
00:00:05,322 --> 00:00:06,425
It's your girl, Jen,

4
00:00:06,425 --> 00:00:08,675
and I have a very
special guest here today!

5
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,074
- Hi, it's Aimee!

6
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:11,920
- It's Aimee, of Song of Style.

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,489
Today, Aimee is going to be
styling me in her clothes,

8
00:00:15,489 --> 00:00:18,125
and I am so excited because
you have so much range

9
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,477
in your fashion.

10
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,207
- Being a Californian girl,

11
00:00:21,207 --> 00:00:23,383
it's definitely like casual-cool,

12
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:25,615
but overall it has like
this polished sense.

13
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:27,383
- We're doing three outfits today.

14
00:00:27,383 --> 00:00:29,351
One is an Everyday Aimee,

15
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:31,763
the second is Business Aimee,

16
00:00:31,763 --> 00:00:33,701
and the third one is Girls Night Out.

17
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,534
- Turn up Aimee.

18
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,367
- Exactly.
- Like turn up, turn up.

19
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:36,569
(laughter)

20
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,666
- No, she goes all night, which is crazy.

21
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,666
But yeah, let's go head
into her closet now.

22
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,583
- Holy cow!

23
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,156
- You can have whatever you want!

24
00:00:45,156 --> 00:00:46,714
- Oh my God, anything?

25
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,131
(jazz music)

26
00:01:00,738 --> 00:01:02,655
- Do I look okay, guys?

27
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,007
- Yeah!
- Here we are, everyday Aimee.

28
00:01:08,007 --> 00:01:10,254
- So, obviously, as you can see,

29
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:12,178
I'm a fan of high-waisted denim,

30
00:01:12,178 --> 00:01:13,560
and anything that has, like,

31
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,174
some kind of distressed detailing,

32
00:01:15,174 --> 00:01:16,529
that's like my thing.

33
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:20,408
I love pairing denim with
like pretty, flowy blouses,

34
00:01:20,408 --> 00:01:23,224
because I feel like it's a
very easy way to dress it up.

35
00:01:23,224 --> 00:01:25,093
I would either wear this entire ensemble

36
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:27,352
with like flats, pointy flats.

37
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:28,900
I love anything that's pointy.

38
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,476
And what's special about this outfit is

39
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:33,144
the see-through details, the ruffles,

40
00:01:33,144 --> 00:01:36,293
the asymmetrical, and all
these, like, little buttons.

41
00:01:36,293 --> 00:01:37,560
I love accessories.

42
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,738
So, like, I'll always a pair of earrings,

43
00:01:39,738 --> 00:01:41,093
or at least one earring.

44
00:01:41,093 --> 00:01:42,569
- I don't think I would actually, like,

45
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,241
naturally pick an outfit like this,

46
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,963
but seeing it on my body,
I absolutely love it.

47
00:01:46,963 --> 00:01:48,425
- You love it?
- I feel so refined!

48
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:49,630
- Especially with this purse, man.

49
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,497
(laughter)

50
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:52,238
I think this is for an occasion

51
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,246
where I wanna look a
little bit more spruced up,

52
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,823
but I can still see the casual elements,

53
00:01:55,823 --> 00:01:57,149
especially with the denim.

54
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:58,532
I think that really grounds it.

55
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:01,707
Alright, so let's get
into look number two.

56
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,280
Alrighty.

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,322
Here's outfit number two, Girls Night Out.

58
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:09,390
I feel very, like, sexy in this.

59
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,518
- [Aimee] For my Girls Night Out,

60
00:02:10,519 --> 00:02:11,885
I love to go dancing,

61
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,713
and I'm all about,
like, being comfortable,

62
00:02:13,713 --> 00:02:15,301
but still sexy.

63
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,500
I feel like this outfit makes
you look super slim and tall,

64
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,410
and really sexy, too.
(laughter)

65
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,166
I have, like, these sparking elements, so

66
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:24,371
I'm all about that one
earring, as I said before,

67
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,182
plus I don't know where the other one is.

68
00:02:26,182 --> 00:02:27,201
(laughter)

69
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:29,166
And then I put you in this, like,

70
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:30,912
metallic Louis Vuitton skirt,

71
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:34,859
and I feel like it plays along
nicely with the sparkles.

72
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,173
And then also I think
this outfit is really sexy

73
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:38,846
because it shows a shoulder,

74
00:02:38,846 --> 00:02:40,352
which is sexy but still, like,

75
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:41,899
polished at the same time.

76
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,769
I like to tone it down with the heels.

77
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:46,030
Since the sleeve is too big,

78
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,429
this is like my little
styling trick that I do.

79
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,802
I put in a hair tie that
like keeps the sleeves up.

80
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:51,930
- Oh my gosh, that's brilliant!

81
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,625
- Some sleeves are really big on you.

82
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,345
- I love this look.

83
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,030
It's also very like refined,

84
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,965
I feel elegant,

85
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:00,809
I feel like this is a good
after-party outfit, you know?

86
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:03,781
When you wanna go dancing,
but still look really chic.

87
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:06,183
Alright, so now I'm gonna
head onto the last outfit,

88
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:10,370
so I'm gonna shimmy on there.
(laughter)

89
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,537
Alright, the grand finale!

90
00:03:13,456 --> 00:03:16,828
This is Boss Aimee, going to meetings.

91
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:18,309
- Oh my god, this is so crazy,

92
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:20,374
'cause it's like something
that I wear every day.

93
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:21,805
To see it on you...
(laughter)

94
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,101
- I know.
- It's so weird!

95
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,375
- [Aimee] I love wearing blazers.

96
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,576
I feel like as soon as
you put a blazer on,

97
00:03:26,576 --> 00:03:29,755
you're kinda more like in
that serious mood, you know?

98
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:31,438
And also polishes the outfit.

99
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:32,311
It cleans the outfit.

100
00:03:32,311 --> 00:03:33,144
- [Jen] Definitely.

101
00:03:33,144 --> 00:03:34,975
- [Aimee] Because that's going on,

102
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:36,897
I like to keep the rest of the outfit

103
00:03:36,897 --> 00:03:38,644
a little bit more fitted.

104
00:03:38,644 --> 00:03:41,288
So like I like the ruffle
in here, I like the leather.

105
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,403
And normally I wouldn't like
mix too many different trends,

106
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:48,041
but I think it makes it fun
to carry on the ruffle theme

107
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:48,990
with the boots.

108
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,897
- Oh my gosh, yeah, these boots are fire.

109
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,508
Like I've never worn just
like under-the-knee boots,

110
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:54,626
I always go over.

111
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:57,556
But this is actually a really
refreshing silhouette on me.

112
00:03:57,556 --> 00:04:01,012
- Then if I were to wear like
a button-up or something,

113
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:02,128
it would be too stuffy.

114
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,487
So I just like dressing
up my T-shirts, so.

115
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:06,787
This T-shirt's from my line, Two Songs.

116
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:08,572
- [Jen] It's so soft, by the way.

117
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:10,389
- [Aimee] And then I finish the outfit off

118
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,841
with my Chanel bag,
it's the Gabrielle bag.

119
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,144
And then I'm all about
stacking rings during work.

120
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:18,530
So like a lot of these are like from Dior.

121
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:20,273
I just also love mixing metals.

122
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:23,124
And then back to the one earring trend.

123
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:24,883
- This beautiful earring over here.

124
00:04:24,883 --> 00:04:25,801
I love this.

125
00:04:25,801 --> 00:04:28,077
It's got a really great contrast to it,

126
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:29,276
'cause you've got the menswear,

127
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:32,604
but you got the femininity
of the ruffle skirt.

128
00:04:32,604 --> 00:04:35,432
It's really cute, I
absolutely love this look.

129
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:37,665
Alright guys, that is a wrap on the video.

130
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:40,234
Please let me know which
outfit was your favorite,

131
00:04:40,234 --> 00:04:43,494
or which Jen-Aimee
version was your favorite.

132
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:44,346
(laughter)

133
00:04:44,346 --> 00:04:46,339
And, yeah, if you guys are
not subscribed to Aimee yet,

134
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,833
please head on over to her channel.

135
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:49,409
She uploads very frequently.

136
00:04:49,409 --> 00:04:50,242
- I'm trying.

137
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:52,213
- We also filmed a video on her channel,

138
00:04:52,213 --> 00:04:54,962
where I style her in my outfits.

139
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:56,592
That one's gonna be really fun.

140
00:04:56,592 --> 00:04:58,085
So, yeah, thank you so much for watching,

141
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,549
and I'll see you in the next one.

142
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,382
Bye!

143
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:03,112
- Ciao!
- Mwah!

144
00:05:03,112 --> 00:00:00,000
(jazz music)
