00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:09,240
Hi, everyone! Happy Sunday. Today, I
am filming a What Would Jenn Wear.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,300
Earlier this week, I asked you guys on Twitter what
kind of video you guys wanted to see today,

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,700
and What Would Jenn Wear won by a landslide, so here it is.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,240
For those who are just tuning in, this is a segment

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,760
where you tweet me your fashion
dilemmas, and I answer them.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,500
And since it is officially winter time,

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,580
I thought that I would specifically choose like
winter-related questions, so let's get started.

8
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:38,180
The first tweet comes from Hannah, and she asks, "What
outfit can you wear to stand out during the holiday party?"

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,720
This question is perfect because New
Year's Eve is right around the corner

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,900
and everyone is going to be dressing to the nines,
and this would be a great opportunity for

11
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:50,600
you to get gussied up to. This is what I'd
rock if I wanted to turn some heads.

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,420
One quick and easy way to stand out
is to have a faux fur moment.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,740
Something about this fun texture just
screams glamour and luxury.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,980
This one is from Storets and I absolutely love
the pleather lapels on the coat.

15
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,020
Underneath, I'm wearing a fitted stripe turtleneck top,

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,440
and then I tuck that into this
black leather skirt with ruffles.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,520
For shoes, I'm wearing these sexy thigh-high soft
boots that are perfectly fitted,

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,560
and there you have it. A fun, flirty look for the season.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,700
So, let's move on to the second
dilemma. This one says,

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,900
"How to look cute for a date while trying to layer up
for the cold at the same time?

21
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,640
"I just started dating this guy, but it's winter in Chicago,
so I feel like I can never dress up."

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,020
It appears we have a little visitor.

23
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,020
Are you gonna stay here?

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,260
By now, I know Chicago is absolutely freezing, and I
know when temperatures are that brutal

25
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,740
it's hard to feel cute, but I feel like it is still possible.

26
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,780
This is my cute winter date outfit for you.

27
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,080
I think the color blush is very flattering on any complexion,

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,300
so I'm rocking this really fun, dusty blush jacket
in this thick shearling material.

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,780
I think it really complements my sweater
underneath. This one is a salmon shade

30
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,840
and it's got these fun stripes all around it.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,680
Also, if you want to stay warm,
wear a thermal underneath.

32
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,320
For my bottoms, I'm rocking these light colored denim

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,340
in this kind of like, badger silhouette, so you can
wear some tights underneath to keep warm.

34
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,280
For shoes, I'm wearing these white heels
from Aldo to streamline my legs,

35
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,520
and lastly, I threw on some blush earmuffs because
honestly, my ears get super cold,

36
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,940
and I feel like having this protection 
would really keep you warm.

37
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:25,400
Regardless of what you're wearing,
if the guy's diggin' you,

38
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,880
he's not gonna care what you're wearing
on the outside; it's about your character.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,980
Good luck with your day and I hope
you guys have a great time!

40
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,240
The third tweet comes from Reese.

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,880
"What would Jenn wear for a casual Christmas look?"

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,920
By the time you're watching this,
Christmas will be tomorrow,

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,140
and chances are I'm definitely gonna keep it casual.

44
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,500
So, this is one of my options that I might wear. Starting
from the top, I'm wearing this polo from Guess.

45
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,240
There's green and red in it, so I feel
like it kind of gives off Christmas vibe

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:56,300
but in a very subtle way. I tucked the top into
these black trousers from Eggie.

47
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,880
I took off the chain in the pants just to make them look
less street style and more like a lounge pant.

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,700
And for shoes, I'm wearing these cute lace-up boots
from Vagabond, and yeah, I called it a day.

49
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,620
I think this is a really cool effortless outfit that
anyone can rock on a Christmas Day.

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,640
Moving on to dilemma four,

51
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,780
"What would you wear with an
oversized fur teddy coat?

52
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,960
I picked this question up because I
have so many fur teddy coats,

53
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,700
and it was really hard to narrow down my favorite one,

54
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,620
but this is the one I chose to showcase. This is
my tan teddy coat from Storets.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,440
This one is pretty oversized and I love it
because I can layer anything with it,

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,020
and it keeps me super warm. Since I live in LA, I
rocked it with a thin, white long sleeve

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,200
But if you live somewhere colder, a white or beige
knit turtleneck would look amazing.

58
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,620
I love the way brown and white looks and it's just a foolproof color combo.

59
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,380
For my jeans, I'm wearing some
high-waisted black skinnies

60
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,280
just because I needed something fitted to
offset the bulkiness of the coat.

61
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,180
I'm wearing my chunky black
platforms to add some height,

62
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,650
and lastly, accessorize with a pair
of asymmetrical earrings.

63
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,620
I think this is a really effortless outfit. You can wear for
grabbing coffee with a friend or just having lunch.

64
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,800
So the last question comes from Feiby.

65
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:13,080
"How would you style crushed velvet jogger-style pants
so it looks fashionable and less like loungewear?"

66
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,300
Jogger pants can be a little tricky because
they are a type of loungewear

67
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,600
and honestly there's nothing
wrong with looking comfortable,

68
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,980
but there are slight modifications you can do with your
outfit to make it look more elevated.

69
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,020
So this is how I styled my crushed velvet joggers.

70
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,480
These are in a festive red color, and I love that they have
black stripes running down both the sides.

71
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,340
I wore them with a black bodysuit from Are You Am I,

72
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,080
but I think any black top would look
killer with a pair of joggers like these.

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,760
For outerwear, I wore a long black tuxedo blazer to
elongate and to give the outfit more structure.

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,680
I really loved how flowy the fabric is and I think
it adds a fashion-forward element to the look.

75
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,220
For shoes, I'm wearing some pointed black boots,
and I feel like these finish off the outfit nicely.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,060
All right guys, that is a wrap on this
episode of What Would Jenn Wear.

77
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,780
If you guys would like to be
featured in the next episode,

78
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,320
feel free to write your fashion
dilemma down in the comments,

79
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,860
or you can tweet me @imjennim and just send
me your fashion dilemma there.

80
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,680
I would love to know how you guys
are celebrating this holiday season.

81
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,520
Tomorrow, by the time I'm watching
this, tomorrow will be Christmas

82
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,360
and so, Ben and I are having my family over.

83
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,220
Ben is gonna be cooking a delicious Christmas roast,

84
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,000
and so I'm super excited to be hosting my family.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,200
Normally, we always have it at my parents' house,

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,420
but this year, we thought we'd switch
it up and we thought we would host it.

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,820
So yeah, I would love to know how you guys are celebrating

88
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,020
Thank you guys so much for the support and the
love, and I'll see you guys in the next one.

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,700
Byeee!

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:00:00,000
Mwah.
