1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:02,876
(groovy music)

2
00:00:11,823 --> 00:00:13,520
- Hey everyone it's your girl Jenn

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,860
and here I am in the
beautiful lovely Phuket.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,070
I am here through through Evolve.

5
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,010
And I had a couple of
extra hours to get ready

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,860
so I brought the camera down

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,970
and filmed a Get Ready With Me.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm gonna show you how
I did this really fresh

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,420
glowy natural look that is
perfect for humid weather.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,720
I know it is winter in most places,

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,430
but in case you are traveling

12
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,670
or you live in South East Asia

13
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,550
or any environment
where it's hot and humid

14
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,160
I thought that this look would be perfect

15
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,470
and without further ado let's get started.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,500
Hello everybody here is my bare face.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,610
Since it is quite sunny out here

18
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,430
I'm gonna start with sunscreen first.

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,030
This is by Murad, it is
their Anti-Aging Moisturizer.

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,080
It's got SPF 30.

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,800
And normally this is Ben's sunscreen,

22
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,140
but we thought we would
consolidate, just bring one.

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,250
No need to bring so many sunscreens.

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,090
I can't forget my neck,
I always forget my neck.

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,840
Alright so now that the sunscreen is on

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,690
I'm gonna move on to foundation.

27
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,110
I'm using this one by Nars

28
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,480
and I've been seeing
this all over YouTube.

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,420
Everyone is raving about
it, including myself.

30
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,720
This has been incredible.

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,230
I put maybe like a pump or
two on the back of my hand

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,820
and I'm just going to dot it.

33
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,440
I've been using this foundation all week

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,430
and it's been great
because it is high coverage

35
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,160
but it doesn't cake up.

36
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,600
This foundation blends so well.

37
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,880
I'm in the color Punjab and
it is a great color match,

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,040
but we've been doing
so many different types

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,030
of activities here all day

40
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,940
and this foundation hasn't
been an issue at all.

41
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,490
Okay so that looks blended to perfection.

42
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,980
I'm just gonna skip concealer

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,360
because I feel like the foundation's

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,160
doing a pretty great job already.

45
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,760
Also whenever I'm traveling
to like a humid country

46
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,550
or climate I just want to
reduce the amount of product

47
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,130
I put on my face because
whenever I do like a full beat

48
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,100
in humidity it just doesn't
translate very well for me

49
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,780
so I'm just gonna move
straight into powder.

50
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,690
This is my favorite
one from Laura Mercier.

51
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:11,930
I have a cute travel
sized one, it is adorable.

52
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,220
So a few of you guys noticed

53
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,320
that I am no longer Close Encounters

54
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,680
on my YouTube channel anymore.

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,528
It just says Jenn Im now.

56
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:21,110
I just thought it was time for a change.

57
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,030
I changed it last week and I just thought

58
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,760
it would be smart for me to
just streamline everything

59
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,360
because whenever you guys come up to me

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,210
like 99% of you guys says I'm Jenn Im

61
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,560
as opposed to Close Encounters.

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,290
I feel like only the OG subscribers

63
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,560
call me Close Encounters anymore

64
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
and I feel like if you're OG

65
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
then you would understand
why I changed it.

66
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,000
Like also with the amount
of saturation in the space

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,358
I just wanted to make my channel

68
00:02:47,358 --> 00:02:49,890
as easy to find as possible

69
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,380
and since the rest of my
social media accounts,

70
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,180
they're all I'm Jenn Im, I thought thatA

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,920
it would just make sense
to call my channel Jenn Im,

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,790
but luckily my URL is
still Close Encounters

73
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:02,370
so that will always be a part of me.

74
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,200
So now I'm gonna use this
mattifying powder by Catrice

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,000
and this is kind of
like a insurance for me

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,270
because I know I'm gonna get oily

77
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,740
so I'm just gonna hit this on my key zone

78
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,510
which is where I get the oiliest.

79
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,590
And I've already tested
this for flash photography.

80
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,040
It has no flash back, thank god.

81
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,560
So now let's move on to the brows.

82
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,450
I'm using Benefit's
Goof Proof Brow Pencil.

83
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,430
And I'm just gonna start
drawing in my brows.

84
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,760
Since it's the new year it is the time

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,175
for new year's resolutions
and I am no exception.

86
00:03:32,175 --> 00:03:35,000
If you know me I am such a freak

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,360
for self improvement and self growth

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,180
and so for my goals for 2018

89
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,840
I would say I just want to focus

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,400
on improving my mental health.

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,490
So I want to continue working out

92
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,310
maybe three to four times a week.

93
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,270
I want to continue going to therapy.

94
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:53,530
I want to meditate at
least four times a week.

95
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,350
Before I was really gung ho

96
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,210
about meditating every single day

97
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,400
but then I started to notice

98
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,250
if I was struggling to
find time to meditate

99
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,540
I would kind of stress myself out

100
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,160
which kind of defeats the purpose.

101
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,900
So I'm gonna have, I'm just gonna try

102
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,700
and meditate as often as I can.

103
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,290
Maybe a goal would be four times a week,

104
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,850
but if I miss a day I'm not gonna

105
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,360
you know beat myself over it

106
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,810
because it is not supposed
to make you feel that way.

107
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,480
I also want to try my best
to eat as healthy as I can.

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,130
So I'm trying, or I'm gonna try my best

109
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,250
to have more of a plant based diet,

110
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,590
but I'm never going to fully announce it

111
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,670
because I think it's gonna
be like a slow transition.

112
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,690
I'm gonna start cutting out red meat

113
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,000
and then eventually white
meat and then all meat.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,730
Just know that I will be trying my best.

115
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,130
Luckily in Thailand it's been quite easy

116
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,460
to eat plant based meals here,

117
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,010
or at least with no meat

118
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,100
because the way they cook
their food is so incredible.

119
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,780
The spices and the way
they saute their veggies.

120
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,570
It just really makes you forget meat

121
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,330
and also a lot of the
girls here are vegetarians

122
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,940
so it's quite inspiring.

123
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,630
So I'm gonna try and take the
habits that I'm getting here

124
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,120
from food and bring that back to LA.

125
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,720
So the brows are done and I'm gonna move

126
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,670
straight into the eyes.

127
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,110
I'm using Colourpop's Birthday Girl

128
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:13,240
and this is like an ultra
shimmery champagne shade

129
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,060
and I'm gonna just pop
that all over my lids.

130
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,350
I love the way this looks on the eyes

131
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,030
because it kind of makes your eyes

132
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,050
look a little wet if you know what I mean?

133
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,900
I think that really
works with this weather.

134
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,560
Oh yeah.

135
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,320
I wish you guys could just
see how glittery this is.

136
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,350
And of course if you've never
used Colourpop eyeshadow

137
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,560
I highly recommend you use your finger

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,570
because you just get the
most color payoff that way.

139
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,590
For the blending shade I'm gonna go in

140
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,670
with this eyeshadow palette by Too Faced.

141
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,420
I'm gonna use Fur Baby

142
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:48,460
which is just like your standard brown

143
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:52,450
and I'm gonna use that for
the outer corners of my eye.

144
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,540
For my channel goals I want
to try and figure out a way

145
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,770
to just kind of amp up my page.

146
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,870
I want to make more fun content

147
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,040
like my party for one look book.

148
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,380
If you guys haven't seen that video

149
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,460
please go check it out.

150
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,030
I'll put it in the cards.

151
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,480
Me and the LR creative
team worked so hard on it

152
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,850
and I feel like fashion videos

153
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:15,440
just don't do as well as they used to

154
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,290
or maybe there needs to be like a new

155
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,890
like format for them because
I feel like with YouTube

156
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,630
it's a little scary to try out new stuff

157
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,500
because if it's too different

158
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,580
people don't like it,

159
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,950
but if it's not different enough

160
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,150
than you don't feel excited
about that if that makes sense.

161
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,440
But I don't know, I'm
gonna try and continue

162
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,500
to figure out how to make fashion videos

163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,300
more interesting and more clickable.

164
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
But yeah I would love to
know what kind of videos

165
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,470
you would like to see.

166
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,960
If you guys can be as specific as possible

167
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
that would be amazing.

168
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,830
Do you guys want to
see more beauty videos,

169
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,920
do you want to see more vlogs?

170
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah just let me know in
the comments down below.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,920
Now I'm gonna use I Rough
You as my inner corner

172
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,640
and brow bowl highlight.

173
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,830
So now that the eyes are done

174
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,210
I'm just gonna give my lashes

175
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,170
a little squeeze with my lash curler.

176
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,210
And then I'll be ready to be primed

177
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,660
by the lovely Lancome Cils Booster.

178
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,870
I am so loyal to this guy.

179
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm kind of running really low.

180
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,690
I'm gonna have to make Sephora order soon.

181
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,930
I packed so many false lashes on this trip

182
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,370
but I haven't worn them at all

183
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,270
because I just haven't
been in the mood really.

184
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,560
I feel like because it's so hot

185
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,930
I just don't want anything else on my face

186
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,120
that is extra so I've just been working

187
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,550
with my natural lashes and they're fine.

188
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,310
So while I wait for my lashes to dry

189
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,430
I'm gonna go in with this blush by Nars.

190
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,504
It is called Intensely
and it looks intimidating

191
00:07:35,504 --> 00:07:39,020
in the package but I swear when it's on

192
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,730
I think it looks quite natural.

193
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,690
I feel like orange really
compliments my skin tone

194
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,316
and I feel like it's gonna really work

195
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:46,530
with this look that we've got here.

196
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:49,110
So I just applied this blush
onto the apples of my cheeks

197
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,380
and I feel like it
gives like a really soft

198
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,020
innocent flush of color.

199
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,630
You can skip highlighter,
but I am definitely not.

200
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,110
I'm using this Tarte Pro Glow palette.

201
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,810
I'm gonna go in with strobe

202
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,350
and I'm going to dust this
onto the tops of my cheeks

203
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:08,300
and then my nose and then
of course the cupid's bow.

204
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,770
And as the day goes on this
is just gonna look dewier

205
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:15,800
and dewier and it's gonna
look very fresh faced.

206
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,500
So the lashes are dry so I'm gonna go in

207
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,350
with this mascara by Lancome.

208
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,390
This is their Definicils.

209
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,680
A lot of you guys are asking about

210
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,400
how the wedding planning is going

211
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
and girls it is going, it is fun,

212
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,958
but it's also very stressful as well.

213
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,320
I think after our wedding I'll do

214
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,030
kind of like a video on
where we got everything

215
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,330
so it can give you guys
a good reference point

216
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,390
on where to get started.

217
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,695
We already got the venue of course.

218
00:08:40,695 --> 00:08:44,330
We got the cake, the
flowers, the videographer,

219
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,730
the photographer, the linens, the tables.

220
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,770
And yeah it's been a lot.

221
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,810
I feel like wedding planning is all about

222
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:55,500
tiny little decisions.

223
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,490
It's kind of like when
you go to the optometrist

224
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,870
and they have that machine

225
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,880
and they go A or B, B or C

226
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,090
and they all kind of look similar

227
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,840
but you know you have to
make the correct decision.

228
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,030
So it's kind of like that.

229
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,180
And as for my wedding dress

230
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,700
I'm getting it custom designed by Mika.

231
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,150
We had a meeting earlier in December

232
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,310
and that was just kind of like, you know,

233
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,330
a get to know you meeting.

234
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,550
I showed him my Pinterest board

235
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,790
and so we're gonna collaborate together

236
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,100
and create the perfect wedding dress.

237
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,780
I am so excited for that.

238
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:28,260
We're gonna meet again after
I come back from Thailand

239
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,520
and so then he'll have some sketches.

240
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,880
And obviously I will be showing
you guys the whole process.

241
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,500
I think I'm gonna do like a wedding series

242
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,470
of how we created our dress.

243
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,560
So stay tuned for that.

244
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,610
So I'm gonna finish off
the look with a lip.

245
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm using this one by
Hourglass, it is called Leader.

246
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,225
And it's just like a really
fun vibrant magenta shade.

247
00:09:49,225 --> 00:09:51,270
I'm obsessed with this color.

248
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,567
I love the way it looks
with a minimal eye.

249
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,591
So now we're gonna seal--

250
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:55,760
(dramatic music)

251
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh my god, oh god.

252
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,760
So now we're gonna seal in
everything with a setting spray.

253
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,780
I'm using Too Faced
Hangover three in one spray

254
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,240
and I really wish I brought my
Urban Decay Anti-Slick spray,

255
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,480
but I forgot it so this will have to do.

256
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:12,420
Mmm, mmm.

257
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,230
Oh it feels so good.

258
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,150
I just want it all over my body.

259
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,310
Alright guys this is the finished face.

260
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,960
I have been pretty much rocking this look

261
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,800
my entire time in Thailand

262
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,700
and I feel like it really suits
this beautiful environment.

263
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,870
I have been having the
time of my life here.

264
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,040
It's been so incredible seeing the sights,

265
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,160
eating the delicious food.

266
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,390
It's gonna be hard for me
and Ben to leave honestly,

267
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,870
but we've been vlogging
our entire time here.

268
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,560
Obviously gonna upload it to the channel

269
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,110
so stay tuned for that vlog.

270
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,860
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching

271
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,810
and I'll see you guys the next one.

272
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:44,643
Bye.

273
00:10:45,487 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
