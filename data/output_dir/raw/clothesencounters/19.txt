00:00:00,237 --> 00:00:01,838
(jazzy hip hop music)

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,877
- Okay, hi, guys.

3
00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:06,716
Welcome to part two of the November vlog.

4
00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:09,650
I am all spruced up
because I'm heading out.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,202
I'm heading out to two events tonight.

6
00:00:11,202 --> 00:00:13,672
I'm going to Raye's makeup launch.

7
00:00:13,672 --> 00:00:16,325
She did a collaboration with BH Cosmetics.

8
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,745
And then after, going
to the Too Faced event.

9
00:00:18,745 --> 00:00:21,243
So yeah, got a full night ahead.

10
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:23,605
I'm gonna give Chippo
her little bully stick,

11
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,522
and then I'm on my way.

12
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,309
Here is Raye's palette.

13
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:33,112
It's actually the exact
same color as my robe.

14
00:00:33,112 --> 00:00:33,945
Wow.

15
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:35,648
I really coordinated well with this, geez.

16
00:00:35,648 --> 00:00:37,898
Dang, this looks delicious.

17
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:48,639
We are at Too Faced event.

18
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:52,472
And they have McDonald fries!
- McDonald fries!

19
00:00:58,983 --> 00:01:01,983
- [Man] Have you seen the dachshund?

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,471
- [Woman] Oh, my God.

21
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:09,358
It's like throttling the floor, okay?

22
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:13,543
- I am halfway being ready,
but I just made some lunch.

23
00:01:13,543 --> 00:01:15,784
This is dak-bokkeum-tang.

24
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,083
It's one of my favorite Korean dishes.

25
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,749
But yeah, I'm about to dig in.

26
00:01:19,749 --> 00:01:21,578
Also, I forgot to mention that Ben

27
00:01:21,578 --> 00:01:24,139
is out of town for a total of 10 days.

28
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:25,670
He is in England.

29
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,692
He hasn't visited in two years.

30
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:30,267
And so it's been just really amazing

31
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:32,275
and surreal for him to be back.

32
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:35,123
But yeah, that means that
I have the house to myself.

33
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:36,709
I'm home alone.

34
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:39,070
Yeah, I haven't been
home alone in this long.

35
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,946
And part of me feels good,

36
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:45,423
because it just really
tests my independence.

37
00:01:45,423 --> 00:01:47,370
And it also makes me realize

38
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,544
how much Ben actually does for me.

39
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:50,920
For example, cooking,

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,044
he pretty much takes care of all of that.

41
00:01:53,044 --> 00:01:54,205
And then filming.

42
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:57,700
And so, yeah, it's been a good transition

43
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,717
because it makes me appreciate
all the things that Ben does.

44
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,028
And yeah, I really do miss him.

45
00:02:03,028 --> 00:02:05,990
But it's good to get some
time away from each other.

46
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,716
When you are in such a long relationship,

47
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:12,158
sometimes distance makes
the heart go fonder.

48
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,462
But yeah, I'm gonna eat this.

49
00:02:13,462 --> 00:02:15,668
I'm frickin' starving.

50
00:02:15,668 --> 00:02:16,535
Oh, my God.

51
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:21,004
I decided to throw in some
broccoli just so I feel better.

52
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:21,908
(jazzy hip hop music)

53
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,741
Mm.

54
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:28,939
- The bad Christmas?

55
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:32,106
- I don't know, it's like Willy Wonka.

56
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:44,185
(gasps) Wow.

57
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,742
Oh, my gosh, look at our dinner

58
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:04,075
for four for two with Aimee.

59
00:03:05,304 --> 00:03:06,137
My God.

60
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,477
(sighs) This feels so nice.

61
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:12,182
Isn't that right, Chippo?

62
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:14,486
Hi. (laughs)

63
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:18,545
It feels so rewarding to
just lay down and do nothing.

64
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,448
But yeah, I just got back home.

65
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,154
Today we went to the
Happy Place exhibition

66
00:03:23,154 --> 00:03:24,779
as you saw in the previous clips.

67
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,913
It was really cool.

68
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:29,799
A really fun, bright,
positive installation.

69
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,065
It is temporary, though.

70
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:33,745
It ends on January 7th,
so if you happen to be

71
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:35,640
in the Arts District and you have tickets,

72
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,085
I definitely recommend you go.

73
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:40,037
Right now I just got back
from dinner with Aimee.

74
00:03:40,037 --> 00:03:43,198
It was so amazing, again,
to meet up with her.

75
00:03:43,198 --> 00:03:45,994
We have been trying to have
dinner for the longest time,

76
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,566
but with both our crazy schedules,

77
00:03:47,566 --> 00:03:50,315
it's been like a mission to plan.

78
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:54,617
But the stars aligned, and we
met, and it was so awesome.

79
00:03:54,617 --> 00:03:57,941
We talked for a good three
hours in that restaurant.

80
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:59,383
Even though Ben's not here,

81
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:01,631
I still love just sleeping
on my side of the bed,

82
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:03,793
because it feels weird
being in the middle.

83
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,337
Chippo's taking his spot.

84
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:06,588
Before I go to bed, I think I'm gonna read

85
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,989
a couple chapters of The War of Art.

86
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:11,269
My brother gave this to me
for my birthday present.

87
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:13,719
Or it was one of his
birthday presents to me,

88
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,628
and I'm excited to continue with it.

89
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,072
Definitely going in my faves.

Hello, happy Saturday.

94
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm shooting with Jami and Kaile.

95
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,051
Can you see 'em?
- Hi.

96
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:27,884
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:04:28,752 --> 00:04:31,771
- There you are, and then Keith

98
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,828
is our lovely photographer.

99
00:04:32,828 --> 00:04:33,661
- Hey.

100
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,494
- Hello.

101
00:04:34,494 --> 00:04:35,327
And then here's Janice

102
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:36,160
helping out.
- Hi.

103
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,770
- But yeah, we are at our second location.

104
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,603
Check it out.

105
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:41,223
I know it looks very
decrepit, but trust me,

106
00:04:41,223 --> 00:04:43,307
we're gonna make it look very chic.

107
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:46,054
We are at our third location.

108
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:50,517
Keith has found this
really cool tangerine wall.

109
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:52,795
And I'm wearing my little
country bumpkin outfit.

110
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:55,962
(jazzy hip hop music)

111
00:05:14,626 --> 00:05:15,960
Happy anniversary.

112
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,793
- Thank you.

113
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:21,511
- [Jenn] Here we are at Dae
Bok Jung about to have some,

114
00:05:21,511 --> 00:05:23,011
I don't even know what this is called.

115
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:23,844
- [Dad] Huh?

116
00:05:23,844 --> 00:05:25,332
(speaking foreign language)

117
00:05:25,332 --> 00:05:26,165
Nakji.

118
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:26,998
Nakji?

119
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:28,194
- Nakji jeol pan.
- Nakji jeol pan.

120
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:30,425
- Celebrating my parents' anniversary.

121
00:05:30,425 --> 00:05:31,719
Hi.

122
00:05:31,719 --> 00:05:32,891
Welcome to our trunk.

123
00:05:32,891 --> 00:05:33,842
- Hi.
- This is Vincent.

124
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:34,685
Katie.
- Hi, I'm Vincent.

125
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:35,518
- Hello.

126
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,683
- You guys have seen
them in my vlogs before.

127
00:05:37,683 --> 00:05:40,051
But basically, we're doing
a little shoot today,

128
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:42,366
shooting Eggie, and then Katie has put

129
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:44,943
her little flair in with her wardrobe.

130
00:05:44,943 --> 00:05:46,982
(Katie giggles)
Yeah, it's been awesome.

131
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,269
But yeah, we're on our third look now.

132
00:05:49,269 --> 00:05:50,102
We're all hunched over.

133
00:05:50,102 --> 00:05:50,935
- We're all like, hey.

134
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:51,768
- I'm wearing Eggie, too.

135
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,538
- I know, Vince season one.
- Yass!

136
00:05:53,538 --> 00:05:54,371
- I love it.

137
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,538
(jazzy hip hop music)

138
00:06:01,302 --> 00:06:02,949
- Cut that you need to listen to,

139
00:06:02,949 --> 00:06:04,102
and then you would be like,

140
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,290
and then you could like, oh, actually,

141
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,484
I don't really like that, and you're like,

142
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:07,317
oh, I'm okay with that.

143
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:08,150
- Okay, cool.

144
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,983
Hey, guys.

145
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:10,991
Today has been a very full one.

146
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:12,554
I didn't get to vlog too much.

147
00:06:12,554 --> 00:06:14,887
But in the morning, Amy came over

148
00:06:14,887 --> 00:06:17,857
and we filmed The AM with Amy.

149
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:20,118
By the time you're watching
this, maybe it's already out.

150
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:23,081
But we basically talked
about negative emotions

151
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,444
and how we deal with them.

152
00:06:24,444 --> 00:06:26,464
I felt really good to talk about a subject

153
00:06:26,464 --> 00:06:28,939
that I don't really talk
about on my channel.

154
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:33,034
I'm practicing being more
vulnerable on my YouTube channel.

155
00:06:33,034 --> 00:06:35,200
And I think it's just hard,

156
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,879
because I don't wanna come off

157
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,330
like I'm just one-dimensional
and I'm happy all the time.

158
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,183
Obviously, I only like
to vlog when I'm happy,

159
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,296
because I'm feeling
good and I wanna share.

160
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:46,645
And I don't know.

161
00:06:46,645 --> 00:06:49,045
So it was good for us to talk

162
00:06:49,045 --> 00:06:51,517
about negative emotions that we deal with.

163
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:56,458
And for me, it was mostly about
stress, anger, and jealousy.

164
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,771
Jealousy is something that
I don't really feel anymore,

165
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:03,682
which is something that
I'm really proud of.

166
00:07:03,682 --> 00:07:07,399
Because growing up, I was
just so envious of everybody,

167
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,719
whether it was their style, or their body,

168
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:11,243
or whether they were funny, or smart.

169
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:12,076
It was a lot.

170
00:07:12,076 --> 00:07:13,282
So I feel happy that I was able

171
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,230
to conquer that negative emotion.

172
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:19,205
But the two that I wrestle
with are stress and anger.

173
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,516
And anger doesn't happen all the time,

174
00:07:21,516 --> 00:07:24,759
but when it happens, it ain't pretty.

175
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:28,353
After that, Amy helped
me shoot so many things.

176
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:31,004
I had a lot of campaign photos due today,

177
00:07:31,004 --> 00:07:33,737
so it was good to get that done.

178
00:07:33,737 --> 00:07:35,755
Then I did some errands.

179
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:39,134
And then the last clip you
saw was me doing a podcast.

180
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:42,779
So I did a podcast called
Perfectly Imperfect

181
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,153
with Christine and Regina.

182
00:07:45,153 --> 00:07:48,799
And it was also something
very cathartic for me.

183
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:51,554
And it's basically as a subject
about connecting the dots,

184
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,502
how we were able to get
to where we are today.

185
00:07:54,502 --> 00:07:56,373
And I didn't expect to get so emotional,

186
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:58,609
but you know, that's
another thing I wanna share.

187
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,138
I'm a very emotional person.

188
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:05,428
Any emotion that I'm
feeling, it's just raw.

189
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:06,364
And I can't control it,

190
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:09,718
and I feel like I've always struggled with

191
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:11,145
hiding my emotions.

192
00:08:11,145 --> 00:08:11,978
Maybe it's a good thing,

193
00:08:11,978 --> 00:08:13,936
because what you see is what you get.

194
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,546
I can't fake anything.

195
00:08:15,546 --> 00:08:17,890
And sometimes I wish I could fake it

196
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,849
when I am about to get really emotional.

197
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:24,016
I had a really difficult call earlier,

198
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:27,192
and I started crying on the phone,

199
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:29,644
and I was like, Jesus, get it together.

200
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,036
And then on podcast, I was crying.

201
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:34,613
I think I'm just going
through a growing pain phase.

202
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,841
I am juggling a lot.

203
00:08:36,841 --> 00:08:40,799
Whenever I feel stressed
or anxious about work,

204
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,098
there's a part of my
brain that's telling me,

205
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:45,139
no, stop feeling this way.

206
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:47,899
You should be grateful,
and you should be happy

207
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,917
that you even have this set of problems.

208
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,583
And I think that's what
I'm just trying to deal

209
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:56,952
with right now, because I
am so grateful for my life.

210
00:08:56,952 --> 00:09:00,452
Even though I, quote unquote, have it all,

211
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,653
emotions are always gonna come.

212
00:09:03,653 --> 00:09:04,815
It's like the weather.

213
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:06,791
Some days it's cloudy,
some days the sun's out,

214
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,784
some days it's a little foggy.

215
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:09,977
And you can't control it,

216
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:11,774
but you just have to
roll with the punches.

217
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,699
For that podcast, I think I got emotional

218
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,717
because I was just really
connecting the dots,

219
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:19,434
and every dot that I made,

220
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,267
it all kinda stemmed from where I,

221
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:24,799
what my childhood was like.

222
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,228
I don't know, I think growing up,

223
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:29,525
I've always had really low self-esteem.

224
00:09:29,525 --> 00:09:32,062
It's crazy how much I
still carry that today.

225
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:35,196
I'm realizing I really can't
control what you think of me.

226
00:09:35,196 --> 00:09:37,524
All I can do is find
inner peace with myself,

227
00:09:37,524 --> 00:09:41,851
and that's what this year has been for me.

228
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:44,813
I'm trying to figure out
the core of who I am,

229
00:09:44,813 --> 00:09:46,613
and just being happy with myself.

230
00:09:46,613 --> 00:09:49,621
I am confident in certain things,

231
00:09:49,621 --> 00:09:53,050
but there is still so
much growth to happen.

232
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,118
Talking about my insecurities
and being more vulnerable

233
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,738
is something that's really good for me.

234
00:09:58,738 --> 00:10:00,490
And so yeah, I think by
the time you watch this,

235
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,054
that podcast might be out.

236
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,472
It is a long one, I must say.

237
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:06,038
So stay tuned.

238
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:08,929
It feels really good being
home alone, actually.

239
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:12,730
It's reminding me of how
I used to feel in Oakland

240
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,244
when I had my own space,

241
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:18,893
and everything I left
it is the way I left it.

242
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:21,042
And I can't blame anyone
if things are dirty,

243
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,290
because it's my mess.

244
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,751
I freaking miss Ben,

245
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:27,696
but it's also been really
nice to have my own space.

246
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:30,628
It's like the first time
I've been alone in two years.

247
00:10:30,628 --> 00:10:33,204
It feels refreshing, but I
think by the time he comes back,

248
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,294
I'll definitely be ready for him to.

249
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,960
But this has been some good
time to reflect on myself.

250
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,807
- [Woman] I injured my
shoulder, this is bad.

251
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:43,568
- You wanna be in it,
even though we're so dark?

252
00:10:43,568 --> 00:10:44,535
- We did it.
- We did it.

253
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:45,565
We're so sweaty.

254
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,504
- Our first time actually
hanging out, and we just

255
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:48,337
sweat next to each other.
- I know, right?

256
00:10:48,337 --> 00:10:49,678
Of course.

257
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:51,110
- [Blonde Woman] That's
the best way, right?

258
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,089
- It really is.

259
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:54,848
- Keon, is this where?
- Yeah.

260
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:57,098
(thumping)

261
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,123
(coughs)

262
00:11:00,123 --> 00:11:00,956
- Morning.

263
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:07,189
Good morning, Happy Thanksgiving.

264
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:12,179
I just made myself a delicious
green tea matcha iced drink.

265
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,017
I'm not sure if you're
supposed to have it iced,

266
00:11:14,017 --> 00:11:15,377
but I don't care.

267
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:17,619
It is hot, and I love iced drinks,

268
00:11:17,619 --> 00:11:20,994
and I think it tastes delicious.

269
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:23,724
Anyway, since it is Thanksgiving,

270
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:26,138
I thought that I would tell you guys

271
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:28,474
some things that I am grateful for.

272
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:30,551
So the first thing that I'm grateful for

273
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:32,447
is definitely my health.

274
00:11:32,447 --> 00:11:35,139
I would say that my body
is in fine condition.

275
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,887
I can exercise, I can dance,

276
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:39,967
I can eat pretty much whatever I want.

277
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,244
When I hear my friends
who have health issues,

278
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,453
whether it is tonsillitis, or arthritis,

279
00:11:46,453 --> 00:11:49,157
or just any sort of chronic pain,

280
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:51,146
it makes me really feel for them.

281
00:11:51,146 --> 00:11:53,537
It makes me check myself,

282
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:55,438
and to never take my health for granted.

283
00:11:55,438 --> 00:11:58,231
The second thing I'm
thankful for is my family.

284
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:00,485
I love that we are finally at a place

285
00:12:00,485 --> 00:12:03,331
where we could all just be
so open with each other.

286
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:05,025
Even though there is a language barrier,

287
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,280
we're still able to communicate.

288
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,924
That's what I want to express to you guys.

289
00:12:07,924 --> 00:12:09,120
'Cause some of you guys are like,

290
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,497
well, if there's a language
barrier, how do you guys talk?

291
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,964
I mix in Korean with English,

292
00:12:13,964 --> 00:12:16,565
and so they understand more English words,

293
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:17,706
but they can't speak it,

294
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:21,133
just like I can understand more
Korean than I can speak it.

295
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:25,169
I am also so thankful for the
relationship I have with Ben.

296
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:28,456
Before I met Ben, I didn't really think

297
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,731
that marriage was for me, honestly.

298
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,419
Kinda weird, but I really thought that

299
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,485
love was just kinda about settling,

300
00:12:35,485 --> 00:12:37,847
'cause no one could be perfect.

301
00:12:37,847 --> 00:12:39,264
And I have never,

302
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,688
I've always been a realist,
and never romantic.

303
00:12:42,688 --> 00:12:45,983
And so I thought maybe, I don't know,

304
00:12:45,983 --> 00:12:48,470
like when I was younger, I
was like, maybe I'll marry

305
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,592
if I want to eventually
reproduce or something,

306
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:54,032
and I would settle for the best companion.

307
00:12:54,032 --> 00:12:55,991
Ben just completely
changed my mind about that.

308
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,907
It's weird, whenever I get
those comments being like,

309
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,574
wow, Ben's so lucky,

310
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,610
I'm like, no, I am the lucky one.

311
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,331
And lastly, I am so grateful for you guys.

312
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:10,889
I couldn't have asked for
a more loving, dedicated,

313
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,849
supportive group of
people to watch my videos.

314
00:13:13,849 --> 00:13:14,939
Thank you, guys, so much.

315
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:18,283
Honestly, you guys have helped
with my self-esteem so much.

316
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:21,133
And sometimes when I don't
even believe in myself,

317
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,690
I look at your guys' comments,

318
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,143
and it truly, truly does heal me.

319
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,732
And I wanna thank you
guys so, so much for that,

320
00:13:28,732 --> 00:13:30,435
and I'm so grateful.

321
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:33,852
Lastly, I am very grateful for my Chippo.

322
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:37,138
Alright, I am at my old childhood room.

323
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,646
Got James playing Zelda.

324
00:13:38,646 --> 00:13:39,512
- Hi.

325
00:13:39,512 --> 00:13:43,638
- And I also went to the gas
station to get some chips.

326
00:13:43,638 --> 00:13:45,740
We've got Chester's Fries,

327
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,462
they're a constant favorite,

328
00:13:47,462 --> 00:13:49,969
these Munchies Flamin' Hot,

329
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:52,771
Snyder's as per James' request,

330
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:55,107
and Hot Cheetos Oven Baked.

331
00:13:55,107 --> 00:13:56,051
These are slightly healthy,

332
00:13:56,051 --> 00:13:58,884
so I thought that I would get 'em.

333
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:01,355
But yeah, here's my old childhood room.

334
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:02,939
There's so much stuff in here.

335
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:03,967
- [James] Yeah, it's
like all my old stuff.

336
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,566
- [Jenn] Yeah.
(both laughing)

337
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:08,965
Yeah, and all my old paintings.

338
00:14:08,965 --> 00:14:12,983
Just eat it, just eat it. (chuckles)

339
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,461
- [James] Mm, it's good.

340
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:16,862
(laughing)

341
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:17,767
- I made it.

342
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,250
- [Jenn] Yeah, papa made some weird,

343
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,515
oh, no, I mean delicious

344
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,649
avocado puree.
- Thank you.

345
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:24,635
- It's weird.
(laughing)

346
00:14:24,635 --> 00:14:26,500
(speaking foreign language)

347
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,883
- Yum, here is my plate for Thanksgiving.

348
00:14:29,883 --> 00:14:33,286
There is no turkey or the
traditional Thanksgiving food.

349
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:37,810
We have a nice Korean-style
Thanksgiving every year.

350
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,477
(speaking foreign language)

351
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,761
Mm.

352
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,536
(speaking foreign language)

353
00:14:46,536 --> 00:14:48,005
(woman laughing)

354
00:14:48,005 --> 00:14:49,296
(game pieces jingling)

355
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,766
- 35.

356
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:52,018
- 35?
- 35?

357
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:53,166
No.

358
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:56,642
(game pieces jingling)

359
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,512
Alright, what could it possibly be?

360
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:01,170
- It's a size small. (laughs)

361
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,251
- [Jenn] Does it mean small?

362
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,500
- Oh.

363
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,689
- [Jenn] Will you be my bridesmaid?

364
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,140
- Oh, yeah.
(Jenn laughs)

365
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,373
Hey, can you be my bridesmaid, too?

366
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:10,019
- [Jenn] Yeah, of course. (laughs)

367
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:10,852
(high-fiving)

368
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,922
Aw. (laughs)
- Aw.

369
00:15:12,922 --> 00:15:15,520
♪ They cover their heads ♪

370
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,571
♪ I can't see their faces ♪

371
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,503
- What's up, guys.

372
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:20,943
I am on my way back from the airport.

373
00:15:20,943 --> 00:15:24,610
I just got qualified
for Global Entry, whoo.

374
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,405
If you don't know what global entry is,

375
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:29,693
it's something that you can apply for,

376
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,043
and then you don't have
to wait in any lines.

377
00:15:32,043 --> 00:15:34,434
You have TSA Precheck-in,

378
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,478
and then when you come back
from a foreign country,

379
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,547
you don't have to wait
in customs in America.

380
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,602
So I am stoked about that.

381
00:15:41,602 --> 00:15:44,672
As long as you have a clean
record, you're pretty much good.

382
00:15:44,672 --> 00:15:47,096
But yeah, yesterday's
Thanksgiving was so much fun.

383
00:15:47,096 --> 00:15:49,147
It was awesome just getting
to hang with the family.

384
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:50,730
I ate so much food,

385
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,798
and I brought back leftovers, too.

386
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:58,248
So I had that for breakfast and lunch.

387
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:02,415
But yeah, I'm gonna go home
now, and just continue to edit.

388
00:16:07,017 --> 00:16:08,324
He's back.

389
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:09,427
- I'm home.

390
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,260
- [Jenn] Yay.

391
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,983
- [Ben] I did miss my girls.

392
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:13,523
- [Jenn] Do you like, (coughs)

393
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:15,315
do you like Chippo's new haircut?

394
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:16,645
- It looks cuter than what I thought.

395
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,421
It looks cuter than it usually does.

396
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:19,254
- [Jenn] Yeah, uh-huh.

397
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:20,425
- 'Cause it's usually a
bit like a rat, don't you?

398
00:16:20,425 --> 00:16:21,790
- [Jenn] 'Cause her face is cute, though.

399
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,396
- Her face is cute, isn't it, Chippo?

400
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,246
- Oh, my gosh, Ben brought back so much.

401
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:27,479
Holy cow.

402
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:30,257
Wow, okay, first we have some chocolates.

403
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,933
This is my dream.

404
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,843
We got Monster Munch.

405
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:34,843
Wotsits, ah!

406
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,472
- [Ben] Chocolate Digestives.

407
00:16:37,472 --> 00:16:38,684
- Oh, my God.

408
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:39,820
That is so big.

409
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,138
(Ben laughs)

410
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,345
This is amazing.

411
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:43,178
- [Ben] Look, it's massive.

412
00:16:43,178 --> 00:16:44,682
I got some things for the guys as well.

413
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:45,867
- What are these?

414
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,041
- [Ben] English choccies, you know?

415
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,120
- What's this?

416
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,136
Jammie Dodgers.
- Jammie Dodgers.

417
00:16:49,136 --> 00:16:50,222
I'm not sure if you've ever had them.

418
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,513
- I've never had them.

419
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:52,802
- Bloody lovely.

420
00:16:52,802 --> 00:16:55,377
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Some Skips.

421
00:16:55,377 --> 00:16:57,127
- Some Quavers.
- Yes.

422
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,313
- Some Monster Munch.
- Oh, my God.

423
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:00,246
- Oh, one of the,

424
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:02,422
I noticed there's a
Wotsit hanging out free.

425
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,862
Some choccy as well.

426
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:05,165
There's a Wotsit gone loose,

427
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,449
so obviously, one of the boxes--

428
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:07,396
- Popped?

429
00:17:07,396 --> 00:17:08,974
- They've popped.
- Ooh.

430
00:17:08,974 --> 00:17:09,970
- 'Kay, so we've got to eat them, then.

431
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:10,888
- Hmm.
- Mm.

432
00:17:11,788 --> 00:17:14,348
- So these are basically like,

433
00:17:14,348 --> 00:17:16,088
like smaller Cheeto Puffs.

434
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:18,781
But they have like a
lovely, fluffly texture.

435
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:20,732
- They're delicious, very similar.

436
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:22,464
I missed you, mm.

437
00:17:22,464 --> 00:17:25,031
- [Jenn] The final one.

438
00:17:25,031 --> 00:17:27,282
- Oh, my goodness.

439
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:28,970
- [Jenn] I wonder what it could be.

440
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,039
- What could this be, huh?

441
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,160
(Jenn laughs)

442
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,493
Oh, my goodness.

443
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:35,812
Ah!

444
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,066
- [Jenn] Will you be my bridesmaid?

445
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:38,899
- I do.

446
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:41,945
- (laughs) Yay.
- Thank you.

447
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,895
- Aw.
- Aw, thanks, Jenn.

448
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:46,282
- Okay, so I'm at Steph's place.

449
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:47,115
- Heyo.
- We just finished

450
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,240
filming a SippingSista.

451
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,728
- I still have some of the first one.

452
00:17:50,728 --> 00:17:51,561
- Oh, really?

453
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:52,967
Okay, bring it over.

454
00:17:52,967 --> 00:17:53,800
- [Steph] Bring it out,

455
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,840
bring it out.
- Oh, my gosh.

456
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,119
This one was the crowd favorite, though.

457
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:58,431
- It's beautiful, too.

458
00:17:58,431 --> 00:17:59,841
It's very aesthetically pleasing.

459
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:00,674
Cheers again.
- I know.

460
00:18:00,674 --> 00:18:01,722
Cheers.

461
00:18:01,722 --> 00:18:04,038
Mm, it's good cold, too.

462
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:06,843
- Yeah, it's pretty much just apple cider.

463
00:18:06,843 --> 00:18:08,884
It was hot apple cider and whiskey.

464
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:11,439
I mean, you really can't
go wrong with that combo.

465
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,504
- No, no.

466
00:18:12,504 --> 00:18:13,913
- Apples and whiskey, come on.

467
00:18:13,913 --> 00:18:15,671
- When you used to make us hot toddies,

468
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:18,179
it was just whiskey and
black tea and honey.

469
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,052
- It was raspberry tea, which is random,

470
00:18:21,052 --> 00:18:21,885
but that's all I had at the time.

471
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:22,767
- Uh huh.

472
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,248
- Bulleit bourbon.

473
00:18:24,248 --> 00:18:25,412
- And agave.

474
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:28,796
- A little bit of agave,
and then I had kumquats.

475
00:18:28,796 --> 00:18:31,625
Remember, and I muddled
kumquats at the bottom?

476
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,458
- What?

477
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,785
- That was in San Francisco.

478
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:34,618
I made that for you one time.

479
00:18:34,618 --> 00:18:35,451
- In your apartment?

480
00:18:35,451 --> 00:18:36,284
- Yeah.

481
00:18:36,284 --> 00:18:37,137
- Oh, my gosh.
- Yeah.

482
00:18:37,137 --> 00:18:38,054
- Dang.
- That was really good.

483
00:18:38,054 --> 00:18:40,470
I love kumquats, 'cause
the insides are super sour,

484
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,813
but then the skin is really sweet.

485
00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:44,248
- And yeah, we filmed a SippingSista.

486
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,199
We made three holiday
cocktails featuring apples.

487
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:48,032
- Yeah.
- So

488
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:49,377
by the time you watch
this, it'll already be out.

489
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:51,712
So hit the card to check it out.

490
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:55,053
- Thank you, thank you. (laughs)

491
00:18:55,053 --> 00:18:56,379
- [Woman] Oh, my gosh,
that's so pretty, girl.

492
00:18:56,379 --> 00:18:58,363
- Hello, happy Tuesday.

493
00:18:58,363 --> 00:19:01,096
I am at Aimee's house.
- (laughs) Hi, guys.

494
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:03,199
- We're filming our collab video today.

495
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:04,916
I just got some nice slippers.

496
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:07,921
She is styling me in her closet today.

497
00:19:07,921 --> 00:19:09,334
I'm so excited.

498
00:19:09,334 --> 00:19:11,999
We've got a little set-up over here.

499
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,375
We may build it.

500
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:14,762
But yeah, let's get started.

501
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,929
(jazzy hip hop music)

502
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,217
Cool.

503
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,050
Yes!

504
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:28,009
Ooh, oh, it looks amazing.

505
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:32,346
- [Woman] Actually, I think it's like a--

506
00:19:32,346 --> 00:19:33,238
- Fudge.
- Okay, so this is

507
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,171
the sponge cake, right?

508
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:36,553
- No, that's the butter cake.
- No?

509
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:37,386
- Butter cake.
- This is the butter cake.

510
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,663
Okay.
- That's the vanilla bean cake

511
00:19:38,663 --> 00:19:39,997
with vanilla bean butter cream.

512
00:19:39,997 --> 00:19:41,337
- Okay, you ready?
- Very excited about this.

513
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:43,035
Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.

514
00:19:43,035 --> 00:19:44,592
(woman laughs)

515
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:45,481
- [Ben] Mm.

516
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:46,814
- Whoa, mm.
- Mm.

517
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:49,002
Wow.

518
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:49,835
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

519
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:50,668
- [Woman] What do you like best?

520
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:53,835
(jazzy hip hop music)

521
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,820
- We're at the Laker game.

522
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,816
I'm with Lauren.

523
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:05,649
- Sports.

524
00:20:05,649 --> 00:20:06,631
- Sports.
- Sports.

525
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:07,849
- Action. (laughs)

526
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:08,682
Drinks.

527
00:20:08,682 --> 00:20:09,623
- Whoo.

528
00:20:09,623 --> 00:20:11,726
- It's the biggest game
of the season, I think.

529
00:20:11,726 --> 00:20:13,487
It's the Lakers and Warriors.

530
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,124
I'm rooting for the Warriors.

531
00:20:15,124 --> 00:20:16,356
Who are you rooting for?

532
00:20:16,356 --> 00:20:18,243
- I'm just here for the Ryu.

533
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:20,363
- (laughs) For the energy.

534
00:20:20,363 --> 00:20:21,287
- For the energy.

535
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,869
- And then James, who
are you you rooting for?

536
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:25,580
- I'm gonna commit to the
Lakers, since it's where I live.

537
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,747
(jazzy hip hop music)

538
00:20:39,402 --> 00:20:40,723
- Good morning, everybody.

539
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:42,939
We are shooting Eggie Drop number three,

540
00:20:42,939 --> 00:20:44,528
the holiday collection.

541
00:20:44,528 --> 00:20:45,665
I've got my glam squad here.

542
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:47,083
We've got the lovely Mitchell.

543
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,590
- What's up.
- Hello.

544
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,926
And then David, of course.

545
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:50,759
- What up.

546
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:52,316
We're reunited.
- I know.

547
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:53,349
So excited.

548
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:54,578
- Super excited.

549
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:56,476
- And lastly,

550
00:20:56,476 --> 00:20:58,153
here she is, yay.
- Oh, hi.

551
00:20:58,153 --> 00:21:01,320
(jazzy hip hop music)

552
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:12,952
- Outfit number one.
- Sultry.

553
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:23,844
- Alright, guys.

554
00:21:23,844 --> 00:21:26,673
That is a wrap on this November vlog.

555
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:27,994
I am obviously in a different place,

556
00:21:27,994 --> 00:21:31,203
because I'm currently in
New Orleans right now.

557
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:32,579
I'm just gonna sign off here.

558
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,296
Thank you so much for watching,

559
00:21:34,296 --> 00:21:36,428
and I'll see you guys on the next one.

560
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:37,771
Bye.

561
00:21:37,771 --> 00:00:00,000
