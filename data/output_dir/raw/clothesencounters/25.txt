1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,417
(calm music)

2
00:00:05,128 --> 00:00:06,779
- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,289
and today is the final
episode of my series

4
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:11,579
with Simple Skincare who
is collaborating with me

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,072
and sponsoring this video.

6
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:15,163
We live in a day and
age where we barely have

7
00:00:15,163 --> 00:00:17,565
any time for ourselves,
and I'm definitely guilty

8
00:00:17,565 --> 00:00:19,754
of not getting enough me time.

9
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:21,606
So today I'm gonna bring
my friend Lauren in

10
00:00:21,606 --> 00:00:24,640
and we're gonna show you
three self care DIYs.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,432
So here we have Lauren.

12
00:00:26,432 --> 00:00:27,938
Yay.
- Yay.

13
00:00:27,938 --> 00:00:30,339
Thanks for having me.
- Yeah thanks for coming over.

14
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,963
- Yeah.
- This is like the first time

15
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:33,138
you've been to my place.

16
00:00:33,138 --> 00:00:34,455
- Mmhmm.
- Oh my God,

17
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:35,844
we're finally doing it.
- I know.

18
00:00:35,844 --> 00:00:36,677
Finally.
- Yeah.

19
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:39,446
So we have the DIY queen herself.

20
00:00:39,446 --> 00:00:42,013
We're doing self care DIYs today.

21
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:44,829
So I just wanted to ask how
do you deal with stress?

22
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:45,719
Do you get stressed easily?

23
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,261
- Oh my gosh, I am the most
easily stressed out person

24
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:50,090
in the entire world,
I'm like super type A,

25
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,405
I'm a list maker.

26
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,313
And I feel like massages
are like my number one go-to

27
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:56,664
for de-stressing when I have time,

28
00:00:56,664 --> 00:00:58,316
and then also meditation.

29
00:00:58,316 --> 00:00:59,149
- Yeah, right.

30
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:01,041
I think lists and
definitely the meditations

31
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,874
are my way to go.

32
00:01:01,874 --> 00:01:03,691
I wish I could enjoy massages more,

33
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:04,806
but I'm just so ticklish

34
00:01:04,806 --> 00:01:07,273
that the first 20
minutes I'm like in pain.

35
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:08,277
(Lauren laughs)

36
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,917
Yeah, but I'm getting there slowly.

37
00:01:09,917 --> 00:01:11,301
I need to chill a little more.
- Working on it.

38
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:15,570
- Yeah, so the first DIY we'll
be doing today is the mask,

39
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,265
these are ingredients that you
can easily find in your home.

40
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:19,578
I notice that when I get stressed out

41
00:01:19,578 --> 00:01:22,315
my skin is the first sign to
show me that I'm stressed,

42
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:24,258
so it'll, like, get really dry,

43
00:01:24,258 --> 00:01:25,713
it'll start breaking out.
- Yeah.

44
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:27,147
- So, yeah, these are the ingredients

45
00:01:27,147 --> 00:01:29,149
for our masks we're making today.

46
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,753
Avocado, Simple's Hydrating Booster,

47
00:01:31,753 --> 00:01:33,657
coconut oil, and honey.

48
00:01:33,657 --> 00:01:35,839
Okay, so should we just
start mixing everything in?

49
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:39,019
- Yes, add it in.
- Yes, okay.

50
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,933
- I feel like these are
all really easy ingredients

51
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,333
I like, already have as well.

52
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:44,683
- For the hydrating
booster you're gonna add

53
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:46,883
like a teaspoon of that, so.

54
00:01:46,883 --> 00:01:49,921
- Hit me with a little
bit of booster. (laughs)

55
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,548
- What kind of skin do you have?

56
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,204
- I have, like, combination skin.

57
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:55,930
I'm dry in some spots,
and then an oily T-zone,

58
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,137
which I feel like is really common.

59
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:57,970
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah.

60
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,563
But I've got like, like
prepubescent skin I feel like.

61
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:01,444
(both laugh)

62
00:02:01,444 --> 00:02:04,840
I'm like oh, I'm 24, I'm ready
to get out of puberty now.

63
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,851
That smells good.

64
00:02:06,851 --> 00:02:07,684
- Oh my gosh,

65
00:02:07,684 --> 00:02:09,550
it does smell really good.
- It smells really good.

66
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,013
- [Jen] Alright, so
this looks pretty, all--

67
00:02:12,013 --> 00:02:14,410
- It looks face-maskable. (both laugh)

68
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,243
Right?

69
00:02:15,243 --> 00:02:16,160
- Yeah it does.
- It looks face-maskable

70
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,090
right now.
- Yes it is pretty much ready.

71
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,986
- Yeah, it's good to go.

72
00:02:18,986 --> 00:02:20,595
- Yeah, so the booster is in here,

73
00:02:20,595 --> 00:02:23,156
can mix it into your
foundation, your moisturizer,

74
00:02:23,156 --> 00:02:25,644
or you can just use it all over your face.

75
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:28,109
- A three in one.
- It is.

76
00:02:28,109 --> 00:02:29,406
- I feel like I look like a '90s child

77
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,183
when I split my hair
like this behind my ears.

78
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:32,578
- Really? (laughs)

79
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:33,883
- I look like a Spice Girl now.

80
00:02:33,883 --> 00:02:35,525
- It's cute, I like it.

81
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:36,358
- Okay, here we go.

82
00:02:36,358 --> 00:02:37,940
What's your method of attack here?

83
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,232
- I'm gonna just plop it on,

84
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,537
- Just go for it.
- I'm just going for it.

85
00:02:40,537 --> 00:02:41,697
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

86
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:42,614
Here we go.

87
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,385
Oh, oh my gosh, it's very cooling.

88
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,017
- I think I have too much,
think I have too much.

89
00:02:48,017 --> 00:02:50,836
- Really? (Lauren squeals)

90
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:52,117
- Oh yeah, you're right, it is cooling.

91
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:52,992
- Yeah.
- I'm like ready

92
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:54,474
for someone to take a chip to my face.

93
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,556
(Jen laughs)

94
00:02:56,556 --> 00:02:59,926
- Yeah this is a very light, thin mask.

95
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,319
I think you just need a really thin layer

96
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,186
'cause you don't want
too much chunks on it.

97
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:05,687
How often do you do face masks?

98
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:06,853
- I probably do a mask, like,

99
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,276
I really like sheet masks as well.

100
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,806
I do these ones maybe like,
I don't know, once a week?

101
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:11,775
How often do you mask?

102
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:13,387
- I do around once a week too.

103
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:14,733
- I'm having more issues than you are,

104
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,188
you were like, you just finessed this,

105
00:03:16,188 --> 00:03:17,282
I'm not so--

106
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,762
- I just kinda winged it,
like, I think you're good.

107
00:03:19,762 --> 00:03:21,428
It looks the same, yeah.

108
00:03:21,428 --> 00:03:24,352
- Girl, it does not look
the same. (both laugh)

109
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:27,846
- So you just leave this on
for 10 minutes, and that's it.

110
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:29,219
- So we just washed our faces,

111
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:31,125
and my face is feeling good.

112
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:32,223
- Yeah, right?
- Right?

113
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:33,549
- I feel like we got most of it off,

114
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:36,760
but just to make 100% sure
that everything's gonna

115
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,066
we're gonna go in with the
Simple Micellar Cleansing Water.

116
00:03:40,066 --> 00:03:41,575
I'll squirt some on.

117
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,223
Yeah, this is my favorite Micellar water

118
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,944
because it's so gentle,
great for sensitive skin,

119
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:49,717
and it makes sure that
everything comes off.

120
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:50,561
- Which I love.

121
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,554
This is like when I find
out that I do a terrible job

122
00:03:52,554 --> 00:03:54,564
of washing my face, it's
like, this is the proof,

123
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:57,618
that's like wow, I did not
put enough effort into that.

124
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:58,451
Already!
- It's like judgment day.

125
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:59,284
Yeah.
- I know,

126
00:03:59,284 --> 00:04:00,580
and there's already makeup on it.

127
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:02,850
- Yeah mine's like, I've
got like debris on mine.

128
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,682
- Debris. (both laugh)

129
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:05,599
- Human debris.

130
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,161
- I just like wanna wash
off this whole pimple,

131
00:04:07,161 --> 00:04:07,994
that'd be great.

132
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:09,873
- I just wanna wash my
whole entire body with this,

133
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,760
you know, just do like an entire cleanse.

134
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,074
- You know, the collar bones.

135
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,950
- Okay, now some stuff really came off.

136
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,618
Since winter is coming as well,

137
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,999
if you've got really dry skin

138
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:20,612
I highly recommend the
Micellar facial gel wash.

139
00:04:20,612 --> 00:04:23,302
This is very hydrating
and good at removing

140
00:04:23,302 --> 00:04:24,254
all your makeup off.

141
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,123
- Oh my gosh, that's like
such a must have for winter.

142
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:27,457
I feel like when the air dries up,

143
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:28,916
I'm like, my skins like
(makes slurping sound)

144
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,330
I need moisture.
- Yeah. (laughs)

145
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:35,592
So our second DIY is creating
your own meditation corner.

146
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:39,720
So here we are in a nice
little corner on the sofa.

147
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,981
- Literal corner.
- Literal corner.

148
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,281
So I think the best corners for meditation

149
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:47,874
are somewhere that's comfortable,

150
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:50,254
somewhere that there's lots
of light and it's serene,

151
00:04:50,254 --> 00:04:53,739
basically anywhere you feel calm.

152
00:04:53,739 --> 00:04:55,419
- No distractions, that's
my number one thing

153
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,371
is like if there's a
distraction anywhere nearby,

154
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:58,516
like, it's over for me.

155
00:04:58,516 --> 00:04:59,511
- Right?
- It's over.

156
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:00,487
- This is what you're gonna need

157
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:01,882
for the meditation corner.

158
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:04,715
A candle, sage, and some crystals.

159
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:07,752
But yeah, so for our meditation corner

160
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,577
we've got some crystals,

161
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:12,605
these are, I mean, they're
apparently supposed to have,

162
00:05:12,605 --> 00:05:14,339
like, power, you know.

163
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:15,721
- I feel like I'm so new to this world.

164
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:16,985
Everyone's like, ooh, crystals,

165
00:05:16,985 --> 00:05:18,981
and I'm like tell me about the crystals.

166
00:05:18,981 --> 00:05:21,610
- I feel like they're supposed
to produce negative ions,

167
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,769
so they're supposed to have
(mumbles), I don't really know,

168
00:05:23,769 --> 00:05:26,953
but basically for me it's kinda
just like holding something

169
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:28,603
and putting intention in it.

170
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:29,844
- Oh my God
- Yeah.

171
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:30,795
- Wait, I kinda love that.

172
00:05:30,795 --> 00:05:31,881
- Right, yeah.
- Yeah.

173
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,452
- So it's just something physical.

174
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,607
And then obviously we
gotta get the smells right.

175
00:05:35,607 --> 00:05:37,603
We've got a big ol' candle

176
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,840
and we've also got some sage.

177
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,053
I've never actually lit sage--

178
00:05:42,053 --> 00:05:43,592
- Neither have I.
- In this house before.

179
00:05:43,592 --> 00:05:45,056
- Woah, are we saging
your house right now?

180
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:45,889
- Yeah, we could,

181
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:47,154
you're supposed to when you first move.

182
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:48,935
- All the bad spirits.
- Exactly.

183
00:05:48,935 --> 00:05:51,769
This is like get rid of all the bad juju,

184
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,484
so yeah, we're going to
probably light this up

185
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:56,646
in a little bit, and then
we also have this app

186
00:05:56,646 --> 00:05:59,857
called Headspace, this is
my favorite meditation app.

187
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:03,001
I have logged in over 100 sessions,

188
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,993
so I'm so excited to do this one with you.

189
00:06:04,993 --> 00:06:06,615
- I know, I'm a newbie to meditation,

190
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:08,812
so today will be my guided, by Jen,

191
00:06:08,812 --> 00:06:10,472
meditation session. (both laugh)

192
00:06:10,472 --> 00:06:13,139
- Alright, I'm gonna light this baby up.

193
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,428
Lauren's got the crystals.
- I'm on crystal duty.

194
00:06:15,428 --> 00:06:16,590
This is my first saging,

195
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,695
I'm so interested to see how this goes.

196
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:19,528
- Oh my gosh.

197
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,176
- Oh, oh yeah she's smokin'.
- She's smokin'.

198
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:23,759
- Be gone bad juju.

199
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:26,288
Oh yeah, that smells like, it smells like

200
00:06:26,288 --> 00:06:28,498
when you go into any kind
of like mystic store.

201
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:31,503
- Yeah, right, it's like
coated in this scent.

202
00:06:31,503 --> 00:06:32,922
Alright, so now we're gonna get

203
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,392
straight into the meditation.

204
00:06:35,392 --> 00:06:37,213
- Your crystal.
- Oh thank you.

205
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:38,968
Thank you. (both laugh)

206
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:41,459
Alright, so I'm gonna
pick a 10 minute one.

207
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,531
- [Man] So either sitting
down or lying down.

208
00:06:44,531 --> 00:06:48,698
And the muscles are softening,
giving way, switching off.

209
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,306
I'll see you back here
tomorrow for day seven.

210
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:53,355
- That was good.

211
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,499
I feel calm and relaxed.

212
00:06:55,499 --> 00:06:56,498
- Yeah, me too.

213
00:06:56,498 --> 00:06:59,642
It just really helps
you catch your thoughts,

214
00:06:59,642 --> 00:07:02,297
because I feel like my
mind's always racing

215
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,049
so whenever I meditate it just helps me

216
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,737
like slow and dial things back.

217
00:07:06,737 --> 00:07:07,570
- Oh my God, for sure,

218
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,643
I feel like there's never not a time

219
00:07:08,643 --> 00:07:09,767
where I'm like okay, what's next,

220
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,902
what's next on my to-do list,
like, what am I doing now?

221
00:07:12,902 --> 00:07:15,394
- Well, what next-- (laughs)
- Well.

222
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:18,549
- Next up we are doing our acai bowls.

223
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:20,438
- Great transition. (both laugh)

224
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,470
- Alright, so for our last DIY

225
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,038
we have the yummy acai
bowl. (Lauren cheers)

226
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:26,663
These are my favorite.
- Me too.

227
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,000
- Yeah, they're very energizing

228
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,505
and they've got a lot of antioxidants,

229
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,940
so great for your skin.

230
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,326
So here's what you're gonna need.

231
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,887
Almond butter, that's optional,

232
00:07:34,887 --> 00:07:38,543
bananas, fresh berries, frozen berries,

233
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:43,346
acai powder, chia seeds, cashew
milk, and coconut flakes.

234
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,747
Okay, so we've got our blender here.

235
00:07:45,747 --> 00:07:47,715
Gonna put all the ingredients in.

236
00:07:47,715 --> 00:07:48,636
- Okay.
- Would you like to start?

237
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,469
- Let's do it, let's do it.

238
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,307
Okay, cashew milk.

239
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:52,816
- I used to work at a
smoothie shop actually.

240
00:07:52,816 --> 00:07:53,666
- Really?

241
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:55,377
Oh my gosh, I worked at a grocery store,

242
00:07:55,377 --> 00:07:56,692
I scooped ice cream.

243
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:57,848
- Me too.
- Really?

244
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,038
- Yeah, wait, which ice
cream store did you work at?

245
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:00,932
- Oh it was a Canadian,

246
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:03,624
like a little mom and pop Canadian place.

247
00:08:03,624 --> 00:08:05,436
- Did your forearm get bigger?

248
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:07,634
Yeah, right, my right
forearm got bigger too,

249
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:09,045
I was like--
- This muscle right here

250
00:08:09,045 --> 00:08:10,495
gets so big.

251
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,531
- Yeah, I worked at Baskin Robbins

252
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:15,027
and one of the test
questions was to memorize

253
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,860
all 31 flavors, yeah.
- Oh my gosh.

254
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,942
- It was nuts, but it was a good job.

255
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,535
I gained like 10 pounds. (laughs)

256
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,208
- Oh my gosh, okay, ready?

257
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,041
- Okay.

258
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,057
- Lid, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

259
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:28,989
- Okay, is it secure?

260
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:30,557
- No, I feel like it's not
on right, is that right?

261
00:08:30,557 --> 00:08:33,557
- Okay yeah, it's on, it's on, okay.

262
00:08:34,407 --> 00:08:37,657
(both cheer and laugh)

263
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:41,934
So then now we just add our toppings.

264
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:45,435
That's strawberries, blueberries, coconut,

265
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,052
- I feel like there's always the pressure

266
00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:49,460
to make it look so pretty.

267
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,889
- Yeah, right?

268
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:53,529
- To just like demolish
it two minutes later.

269
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,859
- Well presentation just
makes food taste better

270
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,424
for some reason.
- I agree.

271
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:58,756
- [Jen] It's like a form of art.

272
00:08:58,756 --> 00:09:01,457
Ooh, I like yours too.
- Eh.

273
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,491
It's like the face mask, I'm like,

274
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:04,473
you finessed it, I didn't.

275
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:06,091
- I've been practicing.

276
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:06,924
Wow.
- Yay.

277
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,947
- Alright, let's have a bite.

278
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:11,614
- Oh my gosh.
- Oooh.

279
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,149
- Mmmh.
- Mmh!

280
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,450
- It's like healthy ice cream.

281
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,725
Okay, I think we nailed it.

282
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,721
This is such a refreshing,
guilt-free snack,

283
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:24,364
I love having it on, like, healthy days.

284
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,254
- It's so re-energizing,
like a little pick me up.

285
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:27,204
- Exactly.

286
00:09:27,204 --> 00:09:29,689
Alright guys, that is a wrap on the DIYs.

287
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:30,804
