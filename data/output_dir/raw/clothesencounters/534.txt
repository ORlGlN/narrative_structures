27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,989
ring and it's just as big black stone

28
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,980
with a dull brass ring and it's really

29
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">nice because the doll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ross is like</font>

31
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's a big statement ring so you</font>

32
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:08,340
could wear it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at night and look really</font>

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:37,829
sophisticated nice what Jolie matched me

34
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:40,530
up with were these Bermuda earrings and

35
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,450
they're so cool because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

36
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,250
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little triangles creating one</font>

37
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,280
big triangle and there's little triangle

38
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,439
spreads on the bottom so it's really

39
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,479
elegant because it's a dangly earring

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,490
but also very funky too because the

41
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,520
color scheme is super cool because the

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,170
yellow really pops out and I also don't

43
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,520
really have that much yellow in my

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,649
wardrobe anyway so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd be</font>

45
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:03,800
really fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try out</font>

46
00:02:03,800 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh
