1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,773
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,430
- [Jenn] Oh my gosh,
look what we have here.

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,900
They have the Canon Rebel T7i.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,400
I am filming this with a Canon T3i,

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,860
so you've come a long way Canon.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,785
Great job.

7
00:00:14,785 --> 00:00:17,368
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,170
This is the Canon M6.

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,404
This might be my new vlogging camera.

10
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:27,030
- [Ben] Flip out screens are important.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,530
- And it's also so light.

12
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,000
Wish I could do like a side
by side comparison, I know.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So I'm back at home with the
new Canon EOS M6, I believe.

14
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,730
This was recommended to
me by my friend Jesse.

15
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,730
Thank you so much.

16
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:44,700
So far, I don't really
know what to think about it

17
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,950
other than that it's a lot lighter.

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,590
I don't know how the sound is,

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,450
or what the quality difference is

20
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,450
so I guess this is just a test.

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,700
This is using the new camera.

22
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,670
I am currently on my way to the West side.

23
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,070
Doing a couple of things out there.

24
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,140
First, we are going to
the Hourglass event.

25
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,660
They came out with a new highlighter.

26
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,240
I'm really excited to try them out.

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,620
They are cream.

28
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,510
And then after, we are
gonna have dinner with

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,343
Ashley and Vanan.

30
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:13,890
We are going to talk
about our goals for 2018.

31
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,750
So yeah, it's going to
be a very full night

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,150
and then when I get back
home, we are celebrating

33
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,910
Robin's belated birthday.

34
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,870
It's been a really long time
since we've all been together.

35
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,362
So it's going to be nice.

36
00:01:23,362 --> 00:01:25,945
(upbeat music)

37
00:01:27,578 --> 00:01:28,495
- Hi!
- Hey!

38
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,230
- Wow!

39
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,960
- Hello, everybody!

40
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,480
It is 5:30 p.m.

41
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,960
I'm about to have a shot of coffee.

42
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,350
And then head off to dinner.

43
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,740
Having a belated birthday
dinner with this one!

44
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,750
We've got a little gem salad and hamachi!

45
00:02:32,727 --> 00:02:33,560
Yum!

46
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:39,864
(gentle rock music)

47
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:42,447
(upbeat music)

48
00:02:46,883 --> 00:02:48,599
(speaking foreign language)

49
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:51,041
(speaking foreign language)

50
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,424
(laughing)

51
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:55,880
This is one of my guilty pleasures.

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,520
Oh, yeah.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,682
Oh and another one of my guilty pleasures.

54
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,072
- California roll.
- California roll.

55
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:04,133
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

56
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:06,844
- Thank you.
- Make a wish!

57
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:07,981
♪ Make a wish ♪

58
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:11,648
(speaking foreign language)

59
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:14,940
- I love you, umma.

60
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:22,620
(speaking foreign language)

61
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,490
Hello everybody!

62
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:25,040
I am back in the office.

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,110
Today was a very, very productive day.

64
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,520
Filmed the B roll for
the thrift haul video

65
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,980
and the speaking portion.

66
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,840
And that's why my office is a mess again.

67
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm so sad, I feel like I just cleaned it.

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,320
Right now, I'm gonna start editing my vlog

69
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,720
for you guys for the Sunday video.

70
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,030
It is my goal to start
uploading two times on YouTube.

71
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,760
Later on, I'm going to
my friend Kelly's house

72
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,620
to help her clean her house.

73
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,810
I think if I wasn't doing YouTube,

74
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,550
I would definitely be doing something

75
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,150
in like the service industry,

76
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,930
or even like cleaning houses.

77
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,340
I freaking love to organize,

78
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,710
especially when it's not my stuff.

79
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,480
I would love to be a part
of the Hoarders cast,

80
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,950
just to excavate an entire property

81
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,640
and just redecorate it and reorganize.

82
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,473
That's what I'm doing today

83
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:10,450
and then we're gonna have dinner

84
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,500
with Anna, Jesse, and Claire, and Ben.

85
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,350
So, it's gonna be good
to have a little reunion,

86
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,531
see some familiar faces.

87
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,114
(upbeat music)

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,680
Oh my goodness.

89
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm about to just gain back
what we just worked out.

90
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,170
We got a little breakfast burrito.

91
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,665
Let's dig in.

92
00:04:35,665 --> 00:04:38,248
(upbeat music)

93
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,520
At Sophie's!

94
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,410
- Hi!

95
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,250
- She's amazed with my
new vlogging camera!

96
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,083
- It's amazing.

97
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,140
- It's so light, feel it.

98
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,520
- Wow!

99
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
Taking over!

100
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,560
I will show you the spread.

101
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,780
We are having a house meeting at my house,

102
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,000
so we have a cheese plate.

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,050
We have chips and salsa.

104
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,030
Annie's, so good!

105
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,170
- [Jenn] These are amazing.

106
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,771
- And Greek yogurt dip and some veggies.

107
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:16,848
Healthy snack.
- Healthy snack.

108
00:05:16,848 --> 00:05:20,810
If there's a heaven on
earth, it is this place.

109
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,643
Oh, yes.

110
00:05:26,276 --> 00:05:28,530
And look at their plates, they are rammed!

111
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,840
Two full plates of salad!

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,980
Meanwhile.

113
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,530
- Us.
- Us.

114
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,799
We're pacing ourselves, you know?

115
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,632
- We're pacing ourselves.

116
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:37,465
- [Jenn] Yes.

117
00:05:37,465 --> 00:05:39,190
You gotta eat this all.

118
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,530
- I'm about to.
- You better.

119
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,096
Ben, that looks pretty ambitious as well.

120
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:46,250
- Yeah.

121
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,330
- Andy's plate, very reasonable.

122
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,290
It's a feast!

123
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,490
They make the best
salads in the world here.

124
00:05:56,906 --> 00:05:58,989
- [Andy] It's very homey.

125
00:06:00,772 --> 00:06:02,689
- Well done, well done.

126
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,660
Huh, this'll do.

127
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,670
Hi, guys, I am in the car.

128
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,380
I am currently on my way

129
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,690
to go shoot with my friend, Rebekkah.

130
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,780
If you guys have been watching
my channel for a long time,

131
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,370
then you know who she is.

132
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,900
She is one of my friends that
I met at community college.

133
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,740
It's actually really so pure how we met.

134
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,080
I remember it was during one
of our really long breaks

135
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,100
and I just saw her sitting down

136
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,150
on one of the planters

137
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:31,540
and she had really cool style

138
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,920
and I was like I'm just gonna go up to her

139
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,330
and say that I like her outfit

140
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,280
and become friends with her.

141
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,610
That was my objective
because when I got out

142
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,160
of high school, I was like, you know what

143
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,120
a lot of my high school friends have left

144
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,700
but I'm gonna try and
create a new community.

145
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,720
She became my friend
and we just hit it off.

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,840
We had a lot of the same interests.

147
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,710
I am obsessed with this bookshelf.

148
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,280
You've got little knick knacks.

149
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,620
Oh my gosh, I'm getting
a lot of inspiration

150
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,810
for my bookshelf, honestly.

151
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,490
And there's the woman
of the hour, Rebekkah!

152
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:07,120
- Can't forget Stella, though.

153
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,910
- [Jenn] Hi Stella!

154
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:09,900
Hey baby!

155
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,600
How cute the living room is!

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,613
It's like a spread in
Kinfolk or something.

157
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:18,196
(upbeat music)

158
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,800
We've made our selects
and now Rebekkah is gonna

159
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,100
do her thing on Lightroom.

160
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,700
Do you remember the first
time we met, Bekkah?

161
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,740
- Yeah, I was sitting--

162
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,160
- On a planter, right?

163
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,760
- I was sitting on a
planter and you were like,

164
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,880
"Hi, you look lonely.

165
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,960
"Do you wanna hang out with me?"

166
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,500
And I was like "Oh, I
am lonely, yeah, sure."

167
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:48,963
- Oh my god.

168
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:52,107
See, I stone-cold went up to her.

169
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:53,780
- You were like, "You look
like you want some friends."

170
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,630
- Did I say that?

171
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,410
- Something like that.

172
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,970
That is a miracle in someone's life.

173
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,310
Like, their first year in college,

174
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,430
someone comes up to them and is like,

175
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,690
"Do you want to be my friend?"

176
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,980
And I was like, "Yeah,
sure, is this happening?"

177
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:09,280
Do not second-guess whether
or not they're gonna

178
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,160
think you're weird because

179
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,910
you're actually gonna make their day.

180
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,640
And you might be friends
with them for as long

181
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,100
as we've been friends.
- I know.

182
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,000
Here is my Green Goddess smoothie,

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,760
and Alexa got the Peanut Butter.

184
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,659
You guys, this is truly a miracle.

185
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,950
I am going away to San
Francisco for a couple of days

186
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,860
and I am only flying with a carry-on!

187
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:54,710
I can't even think of the last
time I traveled like this.

188
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,080
But yeah, Amy inspired me
to travel light and so I am!

189
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,690
Normally, I always have like two bags,

190
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,170
no matter how long a trip is.

191
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,400
I will always have a carry-on

192
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,625
and then I'll have a big one.

193
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm so excited to just breeze by.

194
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,360
Oh, I also can bring my Global Entry card

195
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,970
because I'm traveling alone,

196
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,450
so let me go grab that.

197
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:18,250
Yes, I am heading to San
Jose slash San Francisco

198
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,320
to go visit Sarah.

199
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,190
I haven't seen her since the holidays

200
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,620
and so we thought we would do kinda

201
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
like a trip together

202
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,000
because I haven't seen
her in such a long time.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,530
Check this Global Entry out.

204
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,940
I am flying into San Jose,

205
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,010
which is where she lives.

206
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,580
And then she is going to show me

207
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,220
where she works, where she lives.

208
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,070
And so I can finally see what her side

209
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,070
of the world looks like.

210
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,920
And then we are traveling
all the way to Oakland.

211
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,160
I think it's like an hour drive.

212
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,430
And then we are gonna stay at an Air BnB.

213
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,740
But yeah, this weekend
should be super fun.

214
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm so excited.

215
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,910
So, yeah, I gotta go get an Uber right now

216
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,412
because I'm about to be late.

217
00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:04,283
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪

218
00:10:04,283 --> 00:10:06,280
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪

219
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,070
- So I just landed in San Jose

220
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,630
and I saw Sarah's lovely little home,

221
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,370
and she packed her bag and now we are here

222
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,520
in San Francisco.

223
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:18,810
And we are at our lovely
Air BnB here in Rockridge.

224
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:21,410
It is perfect for two people.

225
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,600
Here is the bed we'll be sleeping on.

226
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,090
A little desk area, which
will be nice in the daytime.

227
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,260
A cute little kitchen space.

228
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,460
We've got a kettle.

229
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,780
We can make some tea, perhaps.

230
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:40,270
And, we've got a full
fridge with a microwave.

231
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,550
So, yeah, Sarah is just
gonna finish getting ready

232
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,470
and then we're gonna do
a night out on the town.

233
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,280
Oh, man, last night was so much fun.

234
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,670
We had dinner, oh, that's cute, I like it.

235
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,110
- [Sarah] It's super chill, I do too.

236
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,630
- Last night was so much fun.

237
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,030
We started off,

238
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,190
where did we start off?

239
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:03,770
Oh, we went to the Golden
Squirrel in Oakland.

240
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:04,603
- Oh, that's what it's called.

241
00:11:04,603 --> 00:11:05,610
- Yeah!
(laughs)

242
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,040
I only remember the
name because there were

243
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,030
squirrels everywhere.

244
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:10,530
I was like, wow, they're
really going for the theme.

245
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,322
We danced so much.

246
00:11:13,322 --> 00:11:14,347
- That was so fun.

247
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:15,190
- Yeah, it was really fun.

248
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,770
- The first ten minutes
was just our high school.

249
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,820
- Yes, literally, they were playing

250
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,120
hip-hop songs from our
era, from like 2005.

251
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,970
- I didn't even know that was a thing.

252
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:25,970
- Yeah, right?

253
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,850
But we literally knew every
single song that came out.

254
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,094
We were like, "We know this song!"

255
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:30,390
- Every song
- "Oh!"

256
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,440
- "We know this song!"

257
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,820
I loved 1015 because
there's so many rooms.

258
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,879
There was like three different stages.

259
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,524
- [Sarah] Yeah, that was cool.

260
00:11:38,524 --> 00:11:40,940
- And they were all distinct as well.

261
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,430
And then our friend, Segundo,
was deejaying the mainstage.

262
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:47,160
And then we saw the Ying Yang Twins.

263
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,850
I woke up and I was like.

264
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,290
- Took a nice walk to Trade Joe's.

265
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,570
- She got me oranges.

266
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:52,727
She's like, "What do you
want from Trader Joe's?"

267
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:53,560
I was like,

268
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,910
"Advil and oranges."
- I was gonna ask

269
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,260
what kind of eye drops you wanted--

270
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,046
- Aww, that's so nice!
- But I didn't want to

271
00:11:58,046 --> 00:11:59,596
get you out of your half sleep.

272
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,760
That place is promising
for the eye drops you need.

273
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,520
They might be overpriced though.

274
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,353
What are we doing today?

275
00:12:05,353 --> 00:12:08,788
We're gonna go get chicken sandwiches at

276
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:11,580
Bake?
- Bakesale Betty.

277
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,560
- And strawberry shortcake and then,

278
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,360
we're gonna go, what cemetery is it?

279
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,080
- Oakland Cemetery.

280
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,756
- Oakland Cemetery, yeah.

281
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,250
(upbeat music)

282
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,360
- [Jenn] Here we have the
famous fried chicken sandwich

283
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,500
at Bakesale Betty.

284
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,250
I love this sandwich!

285
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,150
Gotta have some hot sauce on the side.

286
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:31,672
- [Sarah] I can't believe we're eating.

287
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:33,380
We walked for like, years.

288
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,590
- I know, we went the wrong way.

289
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,140
I directed us the opposite way,

290
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,170
so I added an extra mile to our trip.

291
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:43,662
(upbeat music)

292
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,340
Here we are!

293
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,950
We walked all the way to the cemetery.

294
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,621
How are you feeling?

295
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:53,454
- Warm.

296
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,300
- So, we have our apple
pie from Bakesale Betty

297
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,031
and we're gonna have it on a bench here.

298
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,151
(upbeat music)

299
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:08,031
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪

300
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:11,198
♪ Hello, hello, hello ♪

301
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,253
- Good?

302
00:13:31,147 --> 00:13:33,730
(upbeat music)

303
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:40,980
- Hello, everybody!

304
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,220
It is Monday afternoon.

305
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,010
I am back from the Bay Area

306
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,770
and it feels good to be back home.

307
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,000
But honestly, I could have
used one extra day in the Bay.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,210
That would have been nice.

309
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,630
I think I was just really
enjoying my time over there.

310
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,100
Sarah is one of those friends where

311
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,780
even if I don't speak
to her in like months,

312
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,940
when we do see each other,

313
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,690
it's like no time has passed.

314
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,660
I'm really happy that I made an effort

315
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,710
to go out and see her because

316
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,400
we took a love language
test during Thanksgiving

317
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,060
and her number one was quality time.

318
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,760
And I believe mine was
quality time as well.

319
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,960
I just knew if I want to
fulfill this love language,

320
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,120
I have to go make an
effort to fly out more.

321
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,080
Today is just a day of just getting

322
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,830
my life back together.

323
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,350
I've cleaned the house.

324
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:33,350
I have put all of my luggage away.

325
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,020
Just basically my normal routine

326
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,500
that I do when I get back from a big trip.

327
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,100
I'm gonna go see my therapist today

328
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,340
and I'm really excited
because I try and see her

329
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,840
at least two or three times a month.

330
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,630
If you have quite a
cluttered mind like I do,

331
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,930
it feels really good
to just release it out

332
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,020
to a professional.

333
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,590
I mean, I recommend therapy to everybody.

334
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,490
If you have the time
and you have the funds

335
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,160
to save up and go to therapy,

336
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,030
I highly recommend it.

337
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,220
I even asked my therapist
if she had a therapist.

338
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,550
And she told me that she has one.

339
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,120
So, I mean, that speaks volumes.

340
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,830
Also, there are definitely
cheaper alternatives

341
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,060
for a therapist.

342
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,460
I remember my first one
I got with my healthcare

343
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,850
and it was only $40 per session.

344
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,460
I know it's still like $40,

345
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,630
but you can't put a
price on mental health.

346
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,002
Even though technically, you already did.

347
00:15:26,002 --> 00:15:26,835
- [Flight Attendent] Ladies and gentlemen,

348
00:15:26,835 --> 00:15:28,610
it is our pleasure to
welcome you to Vancouver

349
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:32,270
where the local time is
approximately 12:30 p.m.

350
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,600
- Hello from Vancouver!

351
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,460
I literally just landed like an hour ago

352
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,740
and I just got to my hotel room.

353
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,040
Staying at the Shangri-La.

354
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,420
It is so swanky up in here.

355
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,750
I am here in Vancouver
with Ashley and Stephanie.

356
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:52,110
We're gonna see the
Takashi Murakami exhibition

357
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,260
at this museum that's a
couple of roads that way.

358
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,080
But I'm so stoked because we actually

359
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,582
get to meet him, which is insane.

360
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,950
I don't really know what kind
of look I want to do today

361
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,190
because it's kinda rainy and dreary

362
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:08,460
so maybe I'll do something more exciting

363
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,740
to contrast the weather.

364
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,420
I brought this violet
glitter eyeshadow from Stila.

365
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,440
This is called Violet Vixen.

366
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,610
I mean maybe I'll feel
motivated to use this

367
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,010
because it's been a long
time since I've used color.

368
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,540
Maybe I could use this
tomorrow for the exhibition.

369
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,480
But we'll see.

370
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,720
Either way, we're here until Saturday

371
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,920
so I'm so excited to explore.

372
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,550
I hear that the Asian
food here is so delicious

373
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,064
so I'm ready to get some gains.

374
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:40,114
(muffled television chattering)

375
00:16:40,114 --> 00:16:40,947
- Cheers!

376
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:43,310
- To Vancouver.

377
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,400
- Ashley literally went for the fry

378
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,530
I was stabbing and you
took it off of my fork.

379
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,880
- [Jenn] Sisters.

380
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,080
- And then you went for the
fry that I was stabbing.

381
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,280
- Back in the hotel room.

382
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,930
They gave us this really beautiful dessert

383
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,980
inspired by Murakami.

384
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,390
It is kinda like a mushroom structure,

385
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,640
a macaroon,

386
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,009
some chocolates,

387
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,750
and a chocolate brownie.

388
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,240
We're gonna have dinner later.

389
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,849
- You're going to the
spa in like half an hour.

390
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,839
- I'm getting a massage!

391
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,672
- Yeah, dude.

392
00:17:16,673 --> 00:17:17,506
- I'm so excited.

393
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:19,099
So what can I expect in this massage?

394
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,609
- Just a lot of slippery,
slippery stuff going on.

395
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:22,621
You know, where are the arms?

396
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,079
You don't know where the limbs are.

397
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,119
You don't know where she's standing.

398
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,569
Just a lot of smooth motion.

399
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,566
- That was the best massage ever.

400
00:17:40,566 --> 00:17:43,149
(smooth music)

401
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,550
All right guys, that is the end of

402
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,790
the Jennuary vlog.

403
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,060
I hope you guys enjoyed.

404
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,540
Be prepared for our Vancouver trip.

405
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:55,210
Or be prepared for more Vancouver clips

406
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,530
in the February vlog.

407
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,040
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching

408
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,820
and I'll see you guys in the next one.

409
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,799
Bye!

410
00:18:00,799 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
