00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:02,996
(electronic music)

2
00:00:22,678 --> 00:00:23,732
- Hello there.

3
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,404
Welcome to our hotel room!

4
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:26,781
- [Ben] Woo!

5
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:28,281
First of all, Ben,

6
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:31,243
and Jenn robes,

7
00:00:31,243 --> 00:00:33,439
and they're lovely and thin.
- I know!

8
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:34,272
- This is like the dream.

9
00:00:34,272 --> 00:00:37,109
I've always wanted a nice
robe with my name on it.

10
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:39,119
A nice shower there.

11
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:39,952
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:40,891
- Sit and think.

13
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:43,660
You know, about life as the
water's coming down on you.

14
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,869
(Ben laughing)

15
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:48,319
(electronic music)

16
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:49,400
What's up, guys?

17
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,469
Today is the first day of Coachella.

18
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,389
(cheers)

19
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,109
Oh, I'm so excited.

20
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:57,869
As you can see I'm just doing my hair.

21
00:00:57,869 --> 00:00:58,949
I'm just gonna do what I always do,

22
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:00,866
which is a smooth wave.

23
00:01:01,919 --> 00:01:05,809
For those who are
wondering, I use this by T3.

24
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:07,529
I don't know the name of
this, but it looks like this.

25
00:01:07,529 --> 00:01:08,829
It's got rose gold hardware

26
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:10,809
and I really like the big barrel.

27
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:14,651
That's what gives your
curls that fluffy look.

28
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:16,729
This morning, went to a little bruch

29
00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:20,139
for House of Harlow, which
is Nicole Richie's brand.

30
00:01:20,139 --> 00:01:22,590
Had some food and then I uploaded

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:25,009
my spring make up tutorial.

32
00:01:25,009 --> 00:01:28,290
If you haven't seen it, I'll
leave a card right over there.

33
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,842
It's inspired by the Pirates
of the Caribbean movie

34
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:34,459
and I used the Le Roc's
new palette for that, so.

35
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:36,490
I really had a fun time
creating that look.

36
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,170
The agenda's quite packed already.

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,189
We've got pool party from one to five.

38
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:43,259
John Boy's doing tattoos.

39
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,111
A$AP Ferg is playing at three,

40
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:47,179
and then by five we're hoping that we can,

41
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,370
we're just gonna be at the festival

42
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:51,050
and we can meet up with
everybody, so excited.

43
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,967
(electronic music)

44
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,530
Men shaving men.

45
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,197
(hip hop music)

46
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:23,651
Here we are about to
have a nice little lunch.

47
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:24,671
How's your tattoo?

48
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:26,392
- Yeah, I said all right.

49
00:02:26,392 --> 00:02:27,225
- [Jenn] You gonna show?

50
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:28,181
- It's a nice little chile pepper.

51
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,331
- Oh.
- You know?

52
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,164
- [Jenn] It's so cute.

53
00:02:30,164 --> 00:02:31,891
I was so tempted to get one myself,

54
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:35,041
but oh my gosh, my mother texted me.

55
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,451
She says (speaks foreign language)

56
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:39,212
"No more tattoo."

57
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,661
And I said, "Only Ben is getting a tattoo.

58
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,391
"I am not getting a tattoo."

59
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:45,308
(electronic music)

60
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:52,033
("Shaba" by A$AP Ferg)

61
00:02:54,964 --> 00:02:57,674
Way to the festival now on the shuttle.

62
00:02:57,674 --> 00:02:59,431
Excited, we're gonna
meet up with everybody.

63
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,264
- Yes.
- Yes.

64
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,131
- [Ben] I love Rocky.

65
00:03:01,131 --> 00:03:04,048
(electronic music)

66
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:17,234
- Good morning, guys.

67
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:19,484
It is day two of Coachella.

68
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:25,634
Yesterday, Friday was definitely needed.

69
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:29,394
If I had one word describe
last night was overstimulating.

70
00:03:29,394 --> 00:03:32,514
I truly forget how crowded
and intense the festival is.

71
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:33,805
You've got all these lights,

72
00:03:33,805 --> 00:03:35,764
all these acts, all
your friends are there.

73
00:03:35,764 --> 00:03:37,181
Wrangling people.

74
00:03:38,382 --> 00:03:41,393
I think Friday was to just break us in.

75
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:44,113
We saw Steve Angello last
night, Dillon Francis,

76
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:46,363
Travis Scott and DJ Shadow.

77
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:48,690
DJ Shadow was sick, though.

78
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,451
I didn't know he was a fellow Aggie.

79
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:51,561
He went to UC Davis, too.

80
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:53,291
It's so sick, Stephanie told me.

81
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:56,271
Right now I'm putting on some
of this body glow by Kopari.

82
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:58,242
This is just a body shimmer.

83
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,492
It gives your skin some nice gold flecks

84
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,331
and it looks really great in the sun.

85
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:04,521
I'm obsessed with it and
it smells like coconut.

86
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:07,901
All right, now we are
heading to the guy's house.

87
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,091
We're gonna just settle in there.

88
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:12,030
- Barbecue.
- Doing a barbecue, perhaps.

89
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,081
- Catch up.
- Head out the festival.

90
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,901
- It'd be nice to have a relaxing time

91
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,911
and actually talk without having to shout

92
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,051
while we squeeze--
- Yeah, all right.

93
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,591
- Through people.
- I know, I know.

94
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,730
The group we are going with
go together to the festival.

95
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,211
It's too hectic to meet with
your friends at the festival.

96
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:27,570
- The rose garden.
- The rose garden,

97
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,761
the Sahara tent.

98
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,871
We're at the house, we are prepared.

99
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,670
We've eaten, go rally up the troops.

100
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,451
This is the house that they're staying at.

101
00:04:35,451 --> 00:04:36,961
It is in Palm Desert.

102
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:38,191
The lovely Hannah.

103
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:40,602
Oh, my God, dang, Sophie.

104
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:43,181
Hannah, Sophie, you guys look so good.

105
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,141
- Thanks, Jenn.

106
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,451
- Coachella ready.
- Ready.

107
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:48,368
(electronic music)

108
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,329
- So we just made it to the festival.

109
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,449
Oh my God.

110
00:05:04,449 --> 00:05:05,539
- We have made it.

111
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:07,269
It was so easy to get in today.

112
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:08,919
- I know.
- And it's still light.

113
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,059
Look at this, lovely.

114
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,359
- It's daylight.

115
00:05:11,359 --> 00:05:14,109
(tranquil music)

116
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:23,802
♫ Had to go to LA for the winter

00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:26,302

- What's up day three.
- Final day.

146
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,304

147
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:32,278
♫ And I'm free

(laughing)

150
00:06:35,298 --> 00:06:36,388
- Oh my God, we are delusional.

151
00:06:36,388 --> 00:06:37,458
- We don't feel as good as we--

152
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:38,788
- No.
- Supposedly look.

153
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:42,328
- We look fresh but we do
not feel that way at all.

154
00:06:42,328 --> 00:06:44,498
- First time we're actually
really hanging out.

155
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:45,528
- I know.
- To be honest.

156
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:46,498
- Yeah, it's been--
- Yeah.

157
00:06:46,498 --> 00:06:48,211
- A very hectic weekend.
- I know.

158
00:06:48,211 --> 00:06:49,983
- Today is about Steph and bloody Mary's.

159
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,616
- Yes.

160
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:52,664
- Thank you.

161
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,581
(electronic music)

162
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,126
- So delicious.
- Very delicious.

163
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,097
- [Ben] Changing.

164
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:09,014
(electronic music)

165
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,178
- Bye.

166
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:45,535
Bye.

167
00:07:45,535 --> 00:00:00,000
