1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:04,475
(upbeat guitar music)

2
00:00:04,475 --> 00:00:05,308
- Hey everyone!

3
00:00:05,308 --> 00:00:07,001
It's your girl, Jenn, and here I am

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,173
in my kitchen slash living room.

5
00:00:09,173 --> 00:00:11,212
I thought I would just
switch up the background

6
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:13,172
to keep you guys on your toes.

7
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:16,041
Let me know if you like
it, don't like it, neutral,

8
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:16,877
let me know!

9
00:00:16,877 --> 00:00:19,784
I have gathered all my
favorite things of August.

10
00:00:19,784 --> 00:00:21,590
I can't believe it's over.

11
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:23,245
Summer is gone, y'all.

12
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:24,172
It doesn't feel like it's gone.

13
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,731
We're going through this
crazy heat wave in LA,

14
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:29,292
but regardless I've gathered
all my favorite things

15
00:00:29,292 --> 00:00:30,503
and I'm going to present them to you

16
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:31,934
like we do every, single month.

17
00:00:31,934 --> 00:00:33,247
If you enjoy videos like this

18
00:00:33,247 --> 00:00:34,878
make sure you're subscribed.

19
00:00:34,878 --> 00:00:36,833
Buttons down below, and let's start.

20
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,600
So let's talk about shoes first.

21
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,339
Here I have my white
sneakers from Superga.

22
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:43,787
I actually got this last month

23
00:00:43,787 --> 00:00:46,321
when I was in the Hamptons with Revolve,

24
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:48,399
and they have just been
my favorite sneaker,

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,587
other than my Vans, I love my Vans.

26
00:00:50,587 --> 00:00:52,351
But these are a close second.

27
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,971
These are the shoes that I also styled

28
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,290
in my Eggie look-book,

29
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,457
while I was in Toronto.

30
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:58,732
They just went with every, single outfit

31
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:00,974
and I feel like a pair
of crisp, white sneakers

32
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,649
just adds a nice casual elements

33
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:04,955
to any ensemble.

34
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:06,853
Since I am five foot one,

35
00:01:06,853 --> 00:01:09,008
the one inch platform is very nice

36
00:01:09,008 --> 00:01:10,679
because when you're this short,

37
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:12,098
every inch counts.

38
00:01:12,098 --> 00:01:14,522
And yeah, I really enjoy these shoes

39
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:16,889
and I thought I would give
them a little shout out.

40
00:01:16,889 --> 00:01:18,582
So let's move on to some beauty products.

41
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:21,520
Here is a concealer that I've been loving.

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,190
This is by Hourglass and
I am the shade natural.

43
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,441
I know there's this trend on YouTube

44
00:01:27,441 --> 00:01:29,248
where people are just skipping foundation

45
00:01:29,248 --> 00:01:31,899
and just concealing where they need to

46
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:33,708
and I just jumped on the wagon

47
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,359
because my skin behaves most of the time,

48
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,444
it's a combination of genetics

49
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:41,532
and my skincare, and just the
amount of water that I drink.

50
00:01:41,532 --> 00:01:42,867
I drink a lot of water.

51
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:45,744
I mean my sippy-cup is
always being refilled.

52
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:48,621
But regardless, this have been
my favorite concealer to use

53
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:49,734
because it's very precise

54
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,258
and I like the consistency.

55
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:53,510
Like most people, I have dark under eyes

56
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:56,238
and this guy just conceals everything

57
00:01:56,238 --> 00:01:58,855
and so I just do it underneath my eyes,

58
00:01:58,855 --> 00:02:00,027
around my nose,

59
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:02,070
a little bit on my forehead and chin,

60
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,552
and I just blend that baby out.

61
00:02:03,552 --> 00:02:06,306
For example, I'm not
wearing any foundation now,

62
00:02:06,306 --> 00:02:07,206
just this concealer,

63
00:02:07,206 --> 00:02:09,390
and I think it's doing
a pretty bangin' job.

64
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,973
Another beauty product
that I want to talk about

65
00:02:10,973 --> 00:02:13,335
is this spray from Too Faced.

66
00:02:13,335 --> 00:02:15,314
It is their Hangover three in one

67
00:02:15,314 --> 00:02:16,874
replenishing primer and setting spray.

68
00:02:16,874 --> 00:02:19,229
I first heard about this
from my girl Jackie.

69
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:22,447
She actually showed it
to me right over there.

70
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:23,830
We did a collab video,

71
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:26,222
so if you haven't seen
that also hit the cards.

72
00:02:26,222 --> 00:02:28,303
But, yeah, ever since
she's told me about it

73
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:29,864
I have been hooked on it.

74
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:32,183
I have only used this as a setting spray

75
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:34,862
and it just keeps my face
looking fresh and glowy.

76
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:36,754
It's just been really interesting

77
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:38,676
to see all these different
types of make up trends,

78
00:02:38,676 --> 00:02:39,902
because a couple of years ago

79
00:02:39,902 --> 00:02:42,523
it was all about that
matte, glamorous look,

80
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:46,690
and now it's all about dewey,
highlighted, fresh skin

81
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,175
and I feel like this spray

82
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:51,214
really helps me achieve that look.

83
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:54,043
Alright folks, let's move
on to the book favorites.

84
00:02:54,043 --> 00:02:55,574
I actually have two this time

85
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:56,443
which is really exciting.

86
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,453
I was traveling a lot this month

87
00:02:58,453 --> 00:03:00,837
so I had a lot of time
to kill on the plane.

88
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,974
So the first one is
called The Untethered Soul

89
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,097
by Michael Singer.

90
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:05,994
And this was recommended
by one of you guys,

91
00:03:05,994 --> 00:03:07,112
so thank you so much

92
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:10,394
because this book has
been just life changing.

93
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,498
I feel like just the past few months,

94
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:14,156
my journey with spirituality

95
00:03:14,156 --> 00:03:16,754
and self-awareness has just skyrocketed.

96
00:03:16,754 --> 00:03:17,737
I still have a long way to go

97
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:22,219
but I just feel so much
more connected with myself.

98
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,436
And this book in particular,

99
00:03:23,436 --> 00:03:27,338
it made me just reevaluate my
relationship with my thoughts.

100
00:03:27,338 --> 00:03:28,492
I don't know about you

101
00:03:28,492 --> 00:03:31,452
but my thoughts are constantly racing

102
00:03:31,452 --> 00:03:34,329
and when I'm feeling sad, anxious, or mad,

103
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:37,222
my thoughts can distort
and sometimes I'll think

104
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:39,064
some really crazy things.

105
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:42,564
And this book has made me reevaluate that,

106
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:47,202
made me step back and see
my thoughts as an observer.

107
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:49,541
It's made me just more calm

108
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,982
and more at peace with myself

109
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:53,890
and I feel like with the
combination of meditating,

110
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,299
reading books like this,

111
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:56,183
going to the gym,

112
00:03:56,183 --> 00:04:00,128
I just feel a huge improvement
with my mental health.

113
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,188
And I just highly recommend this book

114
00:04:02,188 --> 00:04:05,368
if you want to just see your
thoughts in a different way

115
00:04:05,368 --> 00:04:07,956
and be more at peace with yourself.

116
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,202
My next book favorite is
called Rich Dad Poor Dad

117
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:11,721
and this was actually recommended to me

118
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:15,444
by my friend, Amy, aka
VagabondYouth here on YouTube.

119
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:16,692
If you don't know her channel

120
00:04:16,692 --> 00:04:17,706
please subscribe to her.

121
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:19,113
She's got a really fun spirit

122
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,715
and a great perspective on life.

123
00:04:20,716 --> 00:04:22,345
So check her out, if you haven't already.

124
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,553
Anyway, so this book is
about financial education.

125
00:04:25,553 --> 00:04:28,263
At school we really
learned nothing about this.

126
00:04:28,263 --> 00:04:30,650
Like, we have econ class, but
that's about the government.

127
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:33,105
And a lot of us learned
to manage our money

128
00:04:33,105 --> 00:04:35,326
through our parents or our friends,

129
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:37,063
and still I feel like that's not enough.

130
00:04:37,063 --> 00:04:39,459
And I feel like this book
has just really changed

131
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:41,563
my whole perspective on my finances.

132
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:43,579
Now whenever I purchase something

133
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,765
I ask myself, is this an
asset or is this a liability?

134
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:50,111
And obviously there are
things I want to purchase

135
00:04:50,111 --> 00:04:51,359
because I want to treat myself,

136
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:53,073
so it's all about a balance.

137
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:55,026
But in the grand scheme of things

138
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:57,669
you want to have more
assets than liabilities.

139
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:00,832
Once you're more conscious
of saving your money,

140
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:02,577
absolutely start investing.

141
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:06,032
So whether that's in a
stock or a municipal bond,

142
00:05:06,032 --> 00:05:08,953
you gotta start a 401K, etc.

143
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:11,081
It's all in this book,
so please check it out.

144
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,832
I feel like if you want to start learning

145
00:05:12,832 --> 00:05:15,019
how to make your money work for you

146
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,757
rather than the other way around,

147
00:05:16,757 --> 00:05:18,220
start reading this.

148
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,753
A lot of you guys know this by now,

149
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:22,743
but I launched my clothing
line, Eggie in August

150
00:05:22,743 --> 00:05:26,313
and it's just been such
an incredible experience.

151
00:05:26,313 --> 00:05:29,850
Thank you so much for the
overwhelming amount of support.

152
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,762
I had to put it in my favorites

153
00:05:31,762 --> 00:05:34,390
because this is such a
huge milestone for me.

154
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,480
And I also wanted to talk about

155
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,900
my favorite piece in the line.

156
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,884
It was very tough to narrow down

157
00:05:38,884 --> 00:05:41,882
but I gotta talk about
the Truck Along Jacket.

158
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,818
I feel like I've always been

159
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:45,736
attracted to really shiny things

160
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,375
and so that's why this patent

161
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,513
has just been catching my eye.

162
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:54,263
Fall is just the time to be
super bold with your layering.

163
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,112
This is also a really insulating fabric

164
00:05:56,112 --> 00:05:58,257
because this material is so dense

165
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:01,596
and unfortunately I haven't
been able to wear it in LA

166
00:06:01,596 --> 00:06:03,976
because it's just been so incredibly hot

167
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:05,758
but once the temperature starts to drop

168
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:07,791
I am definitely going to be rocking this.

169
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,881
I also can't wait to show you guys

170
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:11,610
the new styles that are
going to be dropping

171
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,488
at the end of September
and also in November

172
00:06:14,488 --> 00:06:15,690
and then beyond.

173
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,435
This is only the beginning,

174
00:06:17,435 --> 00:06:20,414
so be prepared for a lot
more Eggie in the future.

175
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,149
So my last favorite is going to be an app

176
00:06:22,149 --> 00:06:23,936
that I've been using the entire year.

177
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:27,589
I have kind of become a
gym rat the past year,

178
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:30,422
I lost 15 pounds since 2016

179
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,192
and I'm gonna do a whole new video

180
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:34,198
on how I lost that weight.

181
00:06:34,198 --> 00:06:35,663
But one of the reasons why

182
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,946
is because I've been using
this app called Seconds.

183
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:41,564
This is basically like, not
like a personal trainer,

184
00:06:41,564 --> 00:06:43,214
but I've made it my personal trainer

185
00:06:43,214 --> 00:06:46,378
because I have created all
these personal timers for me.

186
00:06:46,378 --> 00:06:49,745
So I go on the StairMaster for 20 minutes

187
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,706
and I don't just go on it

188
00:06:51,706 --> 00:06:52,980
without having this timer,

189
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,478
because this really breaks
it down into sections for me.

190
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,227
So I'll used the advanced hit timer,

191
00:06:59,227 --> 00:07:00,944
so for five minutes I'll just be

192
00:07:00,944 --> 00:07:04,565
walking on the StairMaster
at like a good 11,

193
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:06,734
and then for 30 seconds
I'll just be running

194
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,216
on the StairMaster,

195
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,673
and then for a minute and 30 seconds,

196
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:12,296
I'll just be walking and
then running for 30 seconds.

197
00:07:12,296 --> 00:07:14,036
So I do this six times

198
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,024
and by the end of it

199
00:07:15,024 --> 00:07:16,866
I'm literally drenched in sweat

200
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:17,759
and after that,

201
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,714
that's when the real workout begins.

202
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,584
I'll do my strength training.

203
00:07:21,584 --> 00:07:23,984
So I'll go on one of my workout playlists,

204
00:07:23,984 --> 00:07:27,016
and this one has like
13 different exercises,

205
00:07:27,016 --> 00:07:28,296
and I'll do this three times.

206
00:07:28,296 --> 00:07:30,222
And so that's why it's
become my personal trainer

207
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,013
because I'll just put my headphones on

208
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:33,436
and I'll just let the timer run

209
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:34,892
and then I'll just listen to it.

210
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:36,084
I'm gonna do a separate video

211
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:37,961
where I go more in depth
with my workout routine

212
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:38,900
and also what I eat

213
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,661
and just how I lost the weight.

214
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:44,192
Because my past video
on how I lost 10 pounds,

215
00:07:44,192 --> 00:07:45,336
things have changed,

216
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:47,198
and I have definitely worked my butt off

217
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:48,487
to lose the weight

218
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,507
and I can't wait to share
those tips with you.

219
00:07:50,507 --> 00:07:53,179
Alright guys, that is
a wrap on my favorites.

220
00:07:53,179 --> 00:07:55,172
As usual, please write down your favorites

221
00:07:55,172 --> 00:07:56,520
in the comments down below,

222
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,857
also I'm looking for like a film favorite.

223
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,209
I'm looking for like a good,
psychological thriller,

224
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,819
or like a Sci-fi fantasy adventure film.

225
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,333
Write it in the comments down below,

226
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,476

227
00:08:06,476 --> 00:08:07,766
Lastly I just want to thank you guys

228
00:08:07,766 --> 00:08:09,392
for the love and the support.

229
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:12,372
I feel like, I've been
feeling it extra this month.

230
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,998
So I just want to be able to
send that right back to you.

231

235
00:08:21,764 --> 00:00:00,000
