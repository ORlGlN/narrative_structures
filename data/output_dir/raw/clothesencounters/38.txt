1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:02,920
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,275
- [Announcer] We're gonna
make sure you have a safe

3
00:00:19,275 --> 00:00:21,192
and comfortable flight.

4
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,490
- Hi, everybody!

5
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,656
I've made it to New York in one piece.

6
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:34,499
It is currently 9:00 p.m.
and your girl is starving.

7
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:37,799
I am actually here because
I partnered with Innisfree.

8
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,984
I am doing a meetup at
their grand opening store

9
00:00:40,984 --> 00:00:41,857
in New York.

10
00:00:41,857 --> 00:00:44,923
I only brought one suitcase
which is a big feat for me

11
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:47,765
because normally like
no matter where I go,

12
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:51,348
no matter how long I'm staying,
I always take two bags.

13
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,534
I'm just such an overpacker.

14
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:54,470
But this trip it just didn't feel right

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,536
to have like two big suitcases.

16
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:58,365
So yeah, I minimized.

17
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,243
I'm actually going to
head on out to dinner

18
00:01:01,243 --> 00:01:03,703
so I'm gonna put some
makeup on, get freshened up.

19
00:01:03,703 --> 00:01:06,180
I also forgot to pack fake eyelashes

20
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,637
so I'm gonna go to the
corner store and grab them.

21
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:10,086
I'm here with Vanan.

22
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,752
If you guys don't know who she is.

23
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:13,580
I don't think I've actually
ever like introduced you guys

24
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,693
to her, but Vanan is the junior manager

25
00:01:16,693 --> 00:01:20,036
at the management company
that I am with, Rare Global.

26
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:22,001
So yeah, I speak to her every single day

27
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,590
and so this is like our
first trip out together

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,550
so it's been really nice to
like hang out and catch up.

29
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,165
I gotta get ready because I've got...

30
00:01:30,165 --> 00:01:31,319
Wow, it's already 9:19.

31
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:33,875
Wow, time is flying by right now, guys.

32
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,069
- [Podcaster] Only
bringing what I could carry

33
00:01:35,069 --> 00:01:36,418
in my backpack.

34
00:01:36,418 --> 00:01:39,946
Once again, I felt the lightness
of having so few things...

35
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:42,363
(calm music)

36
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:51,742
- Hello!

37
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:52,919
I am back from dinner.

38
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:55,851
Vanan and I had food at the NOMO.

39
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:57,760
It's just like right across
the street from here.

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,811
And it was just really nice

41
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:01,474
and I really, really enjoyed
having the little one on one

42
00:02:01,474 --> 00:02:02,307
with her.

43
00:02:02,307 --> 00:02:05,261
I don't know, I feel like
whenever you have settings

44
00:02:05,261 --> 00:02:09,017
with a lot of people,
it's just easy for things

45
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:10,598
to just be very surface level,

46
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:11,780
so I'm just really happy

47
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,706
that I got to have some
one on one time with her.

48
00:02:13,706 --> 00:02:16,175
I also got a couple of
things that I needed

49
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,377
from the drugstore.

50
00:02:17,377 --> 00:02:20,501
First up, I got this top
coat from Sally Hansen.

51
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:22,148
I think I'm gonna repaint my nails.

52
00:02:22,148 --> 00:02:24,217
I actually got them done at the airport.

53
00:02:24,217 --> 00:02:26,977
They had this really quick
20 minute gel system.

54
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:31,078
But I'm just not digging
like this translucent look.

55
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:34,775
And luckily I packed in one
of my Oribe nail polishes

56
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:35,850
that I wanted to try.

57
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,980
So I'm just gonna paint that

58
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,320
and then put this layer over it.

59
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,196
I grabbed a pack of Simple wipes.

60
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,304
Fake eyelashes.

61
00:02:43,304 --> 00:02:44,884
First, I've got these ones by Ardell,

62
00:02:44,884 --> 00:02:46,963
these are just the Demi Wispies.

63
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:50,144
I also saw this brand, it's called Eylure

64
00:02:50,144 --> 00:02:53,015
and I saw Nikki Phillippi
so I was like holy crap,

65
00:02:53,015 --> 00:02:54,574
I gotta support.

66
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:57,587
So I got these ones which
are the wispier ones,

67
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:59,811
more spaced out, so I
thought these would just be

68
00:02:59,811 --> 00:03:01,949
a really nice, like natural fluttery lash

69
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,844
for, you know, the future.

70
00:03:04,844 --> 00:03:06,779
And then I had to get these.

71
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,421
I cannot escape the chips.

72
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:13,645
I'm probably gonna eat these
in like 15 minutes or so.

73
00:03:13,645 --> 00:03:15,431
I'm gonna just take my makeup off,

74
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,764
watch some hotel TV, and munch on these.

75
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,163
Alright, so now I'm just
gonna take off all my makeup

76
00:03:23,163 --> 00:03:26,080
because I hate having my makeup on,

77
00:03:27,435 --> 00:03:29,490
especially when I'm just lounging.

78
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,907
So I'm gonna remove all that.

79
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:37,612
Now that I have bangs, I have
to have this little headband

80
00:03:37,612 --> 00:03:41,231
because it just, you know,
tucks everything away.

81
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,190
Think I might go shopping tomorrow.

82
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,158
There's like a Reformation
right over there,

83
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,704
the Top Shop, opening ceremony.

84
00:03:47,704 --> 00:03:52,265
So (gasps) I've got like
the shopping itch right now.

85
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:53,569
So I just cleansed my face

86
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,479
and I'm just gonna try
out this Innisfree mask.

87
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,440
They sent me a ton of
masks so I'm really excited

88
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
to try this out.

89
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,471
This is the It's Real Squeeze Mask.

90
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:05,890
Whenever I travel, I love
to put on sheet masks

91
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,095
because my skin can get
a little temperamental

92
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:11,271
after the plane, so I
want to really make sure

93
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:14,604
that it's in tip top shape for tomorrow.

94
00:04:16,658 --> 00:04:19,267
Oh, this one's nice, it
just sticks right on.

95
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:20,615
There's a lot of face masks that I use

96
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:25,263
where it's like so thick that
it just refuses to stay on.

97
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:29,062
So you leave this on for 10 to 20 minutes.

98
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:29,895
Nice.

99
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:37,105
(groans)

100
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:37,938
My knee.

101
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:42,783
Good night.

102
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:46,249
(calm music)

103
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:58,215
Just ordered the avocado toast

104
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,080
and also I got a cappuccino

105
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,602
but clearly I don't get
cappuccinos very often

106
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:05,131
because I had no idea there
would be so much milk.

107
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:08,410
I think I mistook this for Americano.

108
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,604
Whoopsie daisy.

109
00:05:09,604 --> 00:05:11,030
Good morning!

110
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,310
You guys, lighting is so nice.

111
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,640
I'm blessed because this
room has these huge windows

112
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,234
and it makes it just perfect for filming.

113
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,581
So I just cleansed my face,
there's nothing on it,

114
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,315
and now I'm gonna apply
this serum from Innisfree.

115
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:27,628
It's their intensive hydrating
serum with green tea seed.

116
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,179
So this is the first
product I'm gonna apply

117
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,151
after cleansing.

118
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:32,784
Kind of like wash off, tea on.

119
00:05:32,784 --> 00:05:35,354
This formula really helps
reduce your skin's tightness

120
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:39,293
after you wash and it just
really adds a great balance

121
00:05:39,293 --> 00:05:41,223
of moisture back into your skin.

122
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:43,797
And I believe it's a blend of green tea

123
00:05:43,797 --> 00:05:45,789
and green tea seed oil.

124
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,337
So now that my serum is on, I'm
going to put some sunscreen.

125
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:53,274
Even though it's cloudy,
there's still UV rays out there.

126
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:56,087
This sunscreen also feels very serum-like.

127
00:05:56,087 --> 00:05:57,701
Smells kind of citrusy as well.

128
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:00,445
I genuinely forgot how good milk tasted

129
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,516
because I only drink my coffee black.

130
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:04,418
But today I decided to be adventurous

131
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,970
and order a cappuccino, thinking
that it was an Americano.

132
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,911
And then I took a sip
and I was like holy crap,

133
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,681
this is just frothy milk
with a splash of coffee.

134
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:15,223
I'm just gonna go straight
into concealer now.

135
00:06:15,223 --> 00:06:16,730
I'm using this one from Colourpop.

136
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,653
It is their no filter concealer.

137
00:06:18,653 --> 00:06:21,436
I think it's so funny how I came here

138
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:23,375
right as Fashion Week ended.

139
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,042
I've actually been really
enjoying watching Fashion Week

140
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,861
just on social media.

141
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,699
I had zero FOMO and I
think I'm finally at an age

142
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,687
where I don't really get
affected by FOMO anymore.

143
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:36,665
I'm just genuinely happy for
the people that got to go

144
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:39,499
and I like watching the shows on my phone

145
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,408
in the comfort of my own bed.

146
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:42,453
It's just nice.

147
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:46,116
The last Fashion Week I went
to was last year in February

148
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:50,282
and, guys, winter in New
York is so miserable.

149
00:06:50,282 --> 00:06:51,845
Especially for an LA girl.

150
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,655
It's really hard for me
to dress for the weather

151
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,519
because it's just so painfully cold.

152
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,606
I remember last time, me and
Ben, we were trying to go

153
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:01,566
to this restaurant that
was only like a block away

154
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:04,585
from our hotel and it was a
struggle getting out there.

155
00:07:04,585 --> 00:07:06,775
The wind just felt like shards on our face

156
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:09,415
and I wanted to just have like a ski mask

157
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,536
and just a bunch of puffers on me.

158
00:07:11,536 --> 00:07:14,002
And the last thing I was
thinking about was, like,

159
00:07:14,002 --> 00:07:15,003
is my outfit cute?

160
00:07:15,003 --> 00:07:17,257
Because it was just way too cold.

161
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:18,293
Now that this is done,

162
00:07:18,293 --> 00:07:20,141
I'm gonna set everything with a powder.

163
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,652
I'm using Laura Mercier
translucent powder.

164
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:26,013
Turns out my friend Danny is
also gonna be in New York,

165
00:07:26,013 --> 00:07:28,726
or is also in New York
right now, she just landed.

166
00:07:28,726 --> 00:07:30,975
If I had known she was
gonna be in New York,

167
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:33,177
then I would have extended
my trip a little bit.

168
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:35,010
My flight is at 10:34.

169
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,419
It's like a 24 hour trip pretty much.

170
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:39,985
But if I had known she was gonna be here,

171
00:07:39,985 --> 00:07:42,482
I would have like at
least stayed the night.

172
00:07:42,482 --> 00:07:43,815
So if you guys don't know who Danny is,

173
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:46,518
she's the one who lives in Toronto

174
00:07:46,518 --> 00:07:48,386
and she's the one who creative directed

175
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,262
my Eggie editorial lookbook.

176
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,094
She's a Scorpio, so we
just get along so well.

177
00:07:53,094 --> 00:07:56,264
I don't fully really care
about horoscopes that much

178
00:07:56,264 --> 00:07:58,803
but I don't know, why
is it that I get along

179
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:00,450
with every Scorpio that I meet?

180
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,535
Maybe because my moon sign is a Scorpio.

181
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:05,035
Now I'm gonna go in with brows.

182
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:08,344
I've been using this stay
all day waterproof brow color

183
00:08:08,344 --> 00:08:09,202
from Stila.

184
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:13,823
So what I do is I'll only use
it for the meat of my brows.

185
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,132
This is just a really great product

186
00:08:15,132 --> 00:08:17,388
that does a nice gradient.

187
00:08:17,388 --> 00:08:18,864
Now that's done, I'll go in

188
00:08:18,864 --> 00:08:21,850
with Benefit's Goof Proof brow pencil

189
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,017
and then I'll just start
drawing the rest of my brows.

190
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:29,197
Okay.

191
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:31,592
I don't really fuss over
them too much these days

192
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:34,025
because now that I have
bangs, it just covers them.

193
00:08:34,025 --> 00:08:35,383
But I still like to draw them in

194
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:37,413
because you never know if
like the wind's gonna blow

195
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:38,278
or something.

196
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:40,778
I wanna make sure that
something's still there.

197
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:42,448
It's time for eye shadow.

198
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:44,457
I'm using this palette from Colourpop,

199
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:46,560
it is their I Think I Love You.

200
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,923
So I think I'm gonna go in
with this rose gold color.

201
00:08:50,923 --> 00:08:52,776
Yeah, I'm not sure what
Danny and I are gonna do.

202
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:53,843
I think we're just gonna catch up.

203
00:08:53,843 --> 00:08:55,809
I just kinda want to go
shopping for an outfit

204
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:58,163
because of course
everything that I packed,

205
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,024
I suddenly don't want to wear anymore.

206
00:09:00,024 --> 00:09:01,555
I'm reading this book called Wild.

207
00:09:01,555 --> 00:09:05,722
It's about this girl who goes
on this backpacking adventure

208
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:09,072
on the Pacific Crest Trail

209
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:13,217
and she only packed the things
that she genuinely needs,

210
00:09:13,217 --> 00:09:17,081
like fleece socks, a
whistle, water purifier.

211
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,889
I would love to do
something like that one day

212
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,964
because, you know, I really
enjoy being around nature

213
00:09:21,964 --> 00:09:23,835
and I like hiking and stuff

214
00:09:23,835 --> 00:09:26,489
but I've never actually
done anything intense

215
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:27,786
like that before.

216
00:09:27,786 --> 00:09:31,869
Okay, so now I'm getting
Level Up, let's do this.

217
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,393
Okay.

218
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:36,774
Here we go.

219
00:09:36,774 --> 00:09:39,175
Okay, so I'm gonna go
back into Rule Breaker.

220
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:42,519
And then getting a dense
brush, I'm gonna pop that

221
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:46,602
kind of like here in the
inner corner of the eye.

222
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:52,095
So now using this flat brush,

223
00:09:52,095 --> 00:09:54,571
I'm gonna go in with that brown shade

224
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:57,760
and I'm just gonna smoke it out.

225
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,896
So I'm pretty happy with the eye shadow.

226
00:09:59,896 --> 00:10:01,405
I think it's really gonna come together

227
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,431
when I apply these falsies.

228
00:10:03,431 --> 00:10:05,969
But right now, I'm gonna
do a little cat eye

229
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:08,552
using Kat Von D's tattoo liner.

230
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:17,734
Can't believe it's already my
birthday month, it's insane.

231
00:10:17,734 --> 00:10:18,817
Virgo season!

232
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,148
I actually rented a cabin in Big Bear.

233
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:25,760
I'm not the type of person
who waits for someone

234
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,996
to surprise me or plan
something out for me.

235
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,336
I am, I'm like very much a Virgo.

236
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,946
I just like to get shit done

237
00:10:32,946 --> 00:10:34,418
and if I want something to happen,

238
00:10:34,418 --> 00:10:36,093
I'm gonna do everything in my power

239
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,448
to make sure that it does.

240
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:40,718
I got this huge cabin in Big
Bear and it's gonna be so nice

241
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:42,152
to have all my friends there

242
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:44,652
and it's gonna be just
like a big sleepover!

243
00:10:44,652 --> 00:10:46,829
There's gonna be games,
there's gonna be food,

244
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,329
and there's like a hot
tub in the living room,

245
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:51,761
so I think that's gonna be really fun.

246
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:54,511
Okay, so I just applied
Lancome's cils booster

247
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:57,466
and while that's drying, gonna contour.

248
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:00,020
This is Tarte's Pro Glow palette.

249
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,701
I'm gonna go in with Sculpt.

250
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,585
I'm just gonna chisel away.

251
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:06,916
Since I'm born on the 22nd,
I'm a Virgo-Libra cusp

252
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,483
and I really identify with both signs.

253
00:11:10,483 --> 00:11:13,188
I know a lot of people just
like to like brush zodiacs off

254
00:11:13,188 --> 00:11:14,701
but I feel like they're fun to read

255
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,990
because you're just more aware

256
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,234
of all the different
personality traits out there.

257
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:22,857
So Virgos are really meticulous
and they love structure,

258
00:11:22,857 --> 00:11:25,010
they love scheduling, and I feel like

259
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:27,748
that's where I get my organization side.

260
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:31,298
And Libras, they're very social creatures.

261
00:11:31,298 --> 00:11:34,640
They love making sure that
everyone's taken care of

262
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,614
and I definitely identify with that.

263
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:40,298
Ben is also a Libra and
he's just like Libra to a T.

264
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:42,666
For blush, I'm using this one by Tarte.

265
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:43,764
I've already hit pan.

266
00:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,074
Just gonna pop that apples in my cheeks.

267
00:11:46,074 --> 00:11:48,135
And then for highlighter,
I'm using Strobe.

268
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:49,468
Around the nose.

269
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:54,088
For lashes, I'm using
Urban Decay's Trouble Maker

270
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,855
and I'm gonna use this for the bottoms

271
00:11:55,855 --> 00:11:57,622
and a little bit on the tops.

272
00:11:57,622 --> 00:11:59,464
I'm not like a die hard zodiac fan

273
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,739
and it's not like
everything's set into stone.

274
00:12:01,739 --> 00:12:03,982
And I truly do feel like
whatever sign you are,

275
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:06,113
there's something that you can relate to.

276
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:10,362
So whether I was a Leo or
a Taurus or a Sagittarius,

277
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:12,740
there's all something
that we can relate to

278
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,950
and that's the beauty of it.

279
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,395
Alright, lashes are on.

280
00:12:15,395 --> 00:12:16,615
I guess we're done.

281
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:18,070
I'm gonna do my lipstick...

282
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,234
Oh, I guess I should do my lipstick now.

283
00:12:20,234 --> 00:12:21,859
I've just applied the lip color

284
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:26,421
and it's just kind of like
my lips but better shade.

285
00:12:26,421 --> 00:12:28,367
It's like kind of like a glamorous look.

286
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:29,817
I enjoy it.

287
00:12:29,817 --> 00:12:31,398
Just gotta work on my bangs

288
00:12:31,398 --> 00:12:34,680
and then we'll be off to go see Danny!

289
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,751
And also Kristen.

290
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:38,932
Everyone's telling me to do
like Korean see through bangs

291
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:41,716
but I feel like I have
too much bang to do that.

292
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:43,358
Or I guess, I feel like this is

293
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,768
like the Korean see through bangs.

294
00:12:44,768 --> 00:12:48,843
It's like a couple of strands and then...

295
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:50,779
I feel like I look so weird, okay?

296
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:53,650
I would rather just have
a full bang, you know?

297
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,366
Before I forgot, I had
to do a little room tour

298
00:12:56,366 --> 00:12:57,580
of the hotel.

299
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,827
I'm staying at the 11 Howard.

300
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:03,450
So over here is the hallway,
you enter right over there.

301
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,486
Check out this beautiful room.

302
00:13:05,486 --> 00:13:07,070
Little workstation.

303
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:09,527
The most comfortable
bed in the entire world.

304
00:13:09,527 --> 00:13:11,601
View of New York from here.

305
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:14,000
Over here, you've got the bathroom.

306
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,083
So beautiful.

307
00:13:17,668 --> 00:13:18,752
Oh my god.

308
00:13:18,752 --> 00:13:21,409
You guys, it is so hot.

309
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,826
(calm music)

310
00:13:36,257 --> 00:13:38,125
Three Musketeers!

311
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:40,124
A little reunion.

312
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,684
We had like a little
frantic shopping session

313
00:13:42,684 --> 00:13:43,792
at Reformation.

314
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,267
- But isn't it always frantic?

315
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:48,563
I feel like whatever, you're
like I got this, that, that.

316
00:13:48,563 --> 00:13:50,462
But yo, you look--

317
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:51,295
- I know.

318
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:53,462
Got all Reformationed out.

319
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:58,024
(calm music)

320
00:14:11,968 --> 00:14:15,319
You guys, the entire wall
is made out of real plants.

321
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:18,948
They put in an irrigation
system to water it as well.

322
00:14:18,948 --> 00:14:19,865
The future.

323
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:31,268
Alright, guys, here I am
at the Innisfree store

324
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:34,679
in Union Square and the
meetup is about to begin!

325
00:14:34,679 --> 00:00:00,000
(calm music)
