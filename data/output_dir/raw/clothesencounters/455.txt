3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">year-round because I think if I'm</font>

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,230
wearing something really feminine and

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,059
girly and I just feel a little bit too

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,390
like I know proper I guess I just like

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,980
to toughen it up with something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,840
leather in this video<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be selling</font>

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">this white cream leather vest in three</font>

10
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:26,849
different ways and if you stay tuned

11
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:28,230
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a giveaway at the</font>

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,820
end of the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right image</font>

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,620
the first outfit and I'm be talking

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,200
about the leather vest for a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,420
loving the studs on the lapels I think

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,520
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great little detail I think the</font>

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,040
chunky zipper is a really cool touch and

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,080
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really digging that and I decided to</font>

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,110
pair it with my<font color="#E5E5E5"> little jaguar top I love</font>

20
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:54,570
love the collar I just think it's a

21
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,550
really fancy detail and I just think

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,740
looks really sick and to kind of fall

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,320
along with spotted theme I paired it

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,090
with my leopard shorts and they're

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,280
really breezy and I don't know it's

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">really perfect for the summer I went</font>

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,420
with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> gold jewelry to match with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

28
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,910
hardware on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the collar and I don't know</font>

29
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,350
I just think it just ties in really

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,040
nicely and for my lips I'm with a nice

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,030
raspberry color

32
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:27,390
so my second outfit is more of my edgy

33
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,610
tough bad gal outfit and I think the

34
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,560
vest works really well with my cramps t

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,270
if you don't know the cramps are it's

36
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,460
amazing punk band that was forming the

37
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,590
late 70s<font color="#E5E5E5"> so check about I got the</font>

38
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,630
studying on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shirt but really well</font>

39
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,310
with studying on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vesta just thought</font>

40
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,659
I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of cute too</font>

41
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:44,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of correlate them both to soften up</font>

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,049
the entire look I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

43
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,090
very girly which are these lace tiered

44
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,890
shorts I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it adds a nice</font>

45
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,229
feminine touch to my look but not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

46
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,539
girly girl and for jewelry I kind of

47
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,640
went with more of an eclectic mix I went

48
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,069
with this skull turquoise bracelet along

49
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,920

don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know more accessories on the</font>

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,009
bottom i went with these sheer socks and

52
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">i really like the thick band on the knee</font>
