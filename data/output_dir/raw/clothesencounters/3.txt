1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,817
(mellow music)

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,930
- [Jenn] Good morning, this
is our breakfast for today.

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,530
Wow, we definitely got a feast.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,140
I got the egg white omelet
with spinach and mushroom.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,380
The weather's now clearing up.

6
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:20,620
I looked up the weather forecast.

7
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,831
Raining all week.

8
00:00:22,831 --> 00:00:25,184
♪ A tiny little Tabasco. ♪

9
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:26,430
My favorite is actually Tapatio,

10
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,760
but they never have it at hotels.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,332
But it's okay, Tabasco's really good too.

12
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:33,260
- [Stephanie] Tapatio,
they don't do mini's.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,093
I've never seen a mini.

14
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:35,490
- Yeah, me neither.

15
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:36,890
There's a hole in the market.

16
00:00:37,856 --> 00:00:40,439
(mellow music)

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,370
- [Jenn] This is my favorite album

18
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,240
by Kanye West, "Graduation"

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,100
and this is the famous Kanye Bear.

20
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:06,672
(mellow music)

21
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,452
- [Woman] I want one of these flower bags.

22
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,343
Buy me.

23
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,774
(woman laughs)

24
00:01:17,774 --> 00:01:19,017
- [Jenn] Okay, what do you guys think?

25
00:01:19,017 --> 00:01:21,316
Does it go with my outfit?

26
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,899
(mellow music)

27
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,970
- Your Murakami inspired luncheon.

28
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:34,838
(mellow music)

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,560
- [Jenn] There's Ashley
with all her friends.

30
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,780
Here we are at The Botanist.

31
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,440
So, I'm here with Ashley
and Stephanie of course.

32
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,390
- Just Botanist (laughs).

33
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,800
- Just Botanist.

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,022
- Botanist, no "The," no "The."

35
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:53,110
This was actually
recommended by Mike Africa

36
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,530
of Oak and Fort, so thank you so much

37
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,560
for the recommendation.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,884
This is, the aesthetic is
already like, too much.

39
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:00,426
I want my whole house to look like this.

40
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:03,009
(mellow music)

41
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,591
- So we just finished our delicious lunch

42
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:12,370
and know we are at Canada Place.

43
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,233
[Stephanie] I love when there's a Chevron.

44
00:02:14,233 --> 00:02:15,350
[Jenn] It's so cute.

45
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,800
[Stephanie] That's the
one thing I comment on

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,633
and the beautiful view.

47
00:02:20,175 --> 00:02:22,758
(mellow music)

48
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,360
- [Ashley] So, we're shooting
a look book right now

49
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,960
for Jenn's channel.

50
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,720
Robert's the videographer, @roberthill.

51
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,070
It's supposed to be a rainy day look book,

52
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,380
but it's not raining.

53
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:38,031
(mellow music)

54
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,980
- Today we are leaving Vancouver.

55
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,570
We are pretty much all packed up.

56
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,580
I took a nice bath this morning

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,840
and I feel so fresh and so clean.

58
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,040
I love it.

59
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,270
There Stephanie is, she is
just packing her belongings.

60
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,480
I feel like my whole body is so dry here.

61
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,680
I don't know why.

62
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,730
I think it's just because
it's a lot colder here,

63
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,830
but, yeah, today, or I guess
last night was a lot of fun.

64
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,070
I didn't take my camera out.

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:27,080
We went to the Murakami
after party birthday bash

66
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,550
and it was a lot of fun.

67
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,880
There was great music,

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,800
but now we are just
getting ready to go home.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,450
But before, we are grabbing dim sum.

70
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,283
- [Stephanie] Yes.

71
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,116
- [Jenn] Before we left,

72
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,470
I wanted to do a little room tour.

73
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,730
These were are beds that we slept in.

74
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,680
This was Stephanie's
side, this was my side.

75
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,460
Over here, we've got the bathroom.

76
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,020
Very comfortable, spacious, well-lit.

77
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,950
Over here, I've got a bottle
of wine from last night.

78
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,783
- [Stephanie] Half drunk.

79
00:03:53,783 --> 00:03:54,770
- [Jenn] Half drunk.

80
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,120
This is our little living area.

81
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,850
Got some work done here

82
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,850
and then we've got a view of
this hardworking building.

83
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,440
- [Stephanie] Not there
today, though, it's Saturday.

84
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,450
- [Jenn] Yeah, not there today,

85
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,710
but it was interesting to see

86
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,750
corporate life right across us.

87
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,370
Got a very large TV screen.

88
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,050
And, honestly, that's about it.

89
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,380
Yeah, that was our room.

90
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,680
- [Stephanie] Go show
them the, show them the...

91
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,130
- [Jenn] The bar area? Oh, yeah, okay.

92
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,200
Alright, this is the last,
this is the grand finale.

93
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,330
We've got the bar area.

94
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,990
We used this every single
day, the espresso machine.

95
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,450
Oh, and she didn't tell
me about these chips.

96
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,360
A couple nights ago, I was
like I'm really craving chips

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,090
and she was like, oh,
well, there's nothing.

98
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,020
But there was.

99
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,290
- [Stephanie] For your
health, Jenn, for your health.

100
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,190
- [Jenn] I love sour cream and onion.

101
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,550
That's our hotel room tour.

102
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,570
We look like witches (laughs).

103
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,634
(mellow music)

104
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:01,099
(mellow music)

105
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:09,858
(mellow music)

106
00:05:11,498 --> 00:05:14,215
- We used the one that has more move

107
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,715
rather than these.

108
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,363
(mellow music)

109
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,341
- [Ashley] Are we changing the hair now?

110
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,333
- Yes.

111
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,543
- [Ashley] Okay, 'cause I need to do a

112
00:05:29,543 --> 00:05:30,420
tighter curl for that look.

113
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,541
- For the Gigi look?

114
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:35,340
Hi, everybody, it is Thursday

115
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,400
and today is actually
a really exciting day

116
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,690
because we're shooting for
the Coachella drop for Eggie.

117
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,523
I am so stoked.

118
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:44,940
We are at my friend
Honor and Brandon's house

119
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,470
and their home is literally
like a 70s wonderland.

120
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,490
And so, yeah, I can't show
you too much of the clothes,

121
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:54,000
'cause I want it to have
some sort of suspense,

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,370
so I'm sorry if don't get too many clips.

123
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,930
I just finished hair and makeup.

124
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,040
My hair is by Ashley and the
glam is by Daniel Chinchilla.

125
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,793
It's such an incredible job

126
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:07,610
and I am so blessed to
have a team like this.

127
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,070
- Do you want anybody?
- We earned this one guys.

128
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,940
- Oh, definitely.

129
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,410
They only gave me two California rolls.

130
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,243
Excuse me?

131
00:06:14,243 --> 00:06:15,350
- [Woman] Two pieces?
- What?

132
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,590
- [Woman] How much are
you supposed to have?

133
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,658
- At least four, at least four.

134
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:23,658
♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪

135
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:28,305
♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪

136
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:32,161
- [Jenn] Congratulations Laylee.

137
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:33,196
- Thank you.

138
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:35,820
- [Jenn] I'm so proud of you, my baby.

139
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,490
Currently at the Eggie headquarters

140
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:39,454
planning for the summer drop.

141
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:42,310
- It's not really velvety, but kind of,

142
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,086
but it's like sparkly.

143
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:44,919
- Ooh.

144
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:50,932
♪ Summer snow, summer snow ♪

145
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:58,530
- Look how pretty this wrapping paper is.

146
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,980
Hey, baby girl.

147
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,330
These presents are for Amy.

148
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:11,300
Today is Amy's 24th birthday, I believe.

149
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,340
And I'm gonna see her in a couple hours.

150
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,520
I'm gonna take her out to dinner

151
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,590
and then we're all gonna go out bowling

152
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,740
which should be fun.

153
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:20,090
I know I already went bowling,

154
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,260
like, a couple nights ago,

155
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,700
but I think that was meant for practice.

156
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,370
And although I'm not the best bowler,

157
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,400
I just really like the
atmosphere bowling alleys have.

158
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,890
There's like food, there's
drinks, there's music,

159
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,890
there's competition and
it's just really fun.

160
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,570
But yeah, I'm so excited to
be spending Amy's birthday

161
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:43,910
because Amy has been
such a gift in my life.

162
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,700
It's so crazy how close we've gotten

163
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,970
within the past six or seven months.

164
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,270
She also has a YouTube channel,

165
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,240
so please go check her out.

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,930
I'll leave her link in
the description box,

167
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,300
but she's incredible for advice

168
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,890
and for recommendations for books

169
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,450
and she's just an all
around amazing person.

170
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,910
So, please go check her
out if you have some time.

171
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,140
So, I just finished writing
my birthday card for Amy.

172
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,320
Whenever it's someone's birthday,

173
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,090
I really like to write out a card.

174
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,830
And not just like a, "Happy
Birthday, Love, Jenn."

175
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,940
I like to really go in and talk

176
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,000
about what I love about that person,

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,730
how far we've come, or
something I'm proud of them for.

178
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,810
I think I'm just a very vocal person

179
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,600
and if I have a lot on my mind,

180
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,410
I want to tell them because
I feel like life is so short.

181
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,850
I mean, God forbid something happens.

182
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,220
Like I, if this is the last
time we are able to speak,

183
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,409
I would want them to know
everything that I feel about them

184
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,709
and I know there's that saying like,

185
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:40,669
"Oh, some things are just known"

186
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,390
or "Some things are unspoken,"

187
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,500
I forget what that phrase is.

188
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,560
But, basically, I don't believe in that.

189
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,780
I think you should say how you feel

190
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,560
especially if you love someone so much.

191
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,980
And so, whenever I write
like a Valentine's Day card

192
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,280
or a birthday card or a
Christmas card, I try and go in

193
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,050
and when people do that
to me, it means so much.

194
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,620
And I think it's because
words of appreciation

195
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,440
is pretty high on my love languages test.

196
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,870
I feel like this world
needs so much more love.

197
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:14,370
So much more, so if you love
someone, tell them, right now.

198
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,610
Text them, call them, email them.

199
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,590
- [Jenn] Happy Birthday, Amy.

200
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,033
You're an adult now.

201
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:22,120
- Yay, thanks Jenn.

202
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,770
- [Jenn] We just had (speaks
in foreign language).

203
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,900
I asked Amy what she wanted
and she said she wanted this.

204
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,210
- This is always a favorite.

205
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,043
- [Jenn] Yes.

206
00:09:35,222 --> 00:09:37,972
(Mariachi music)

207
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,690
- [Jenn] Bowling right now
and this is honestly the best

208
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,785
I've ever done, you guys.

209
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:44,785
- [Amy] Wow.

210
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:52,392
(tick tocking music)

211
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,710
- [Woman In Green] Okay,
sorry, that was me then.

212
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,900
- [Jenn] You guys, check
out this stunning floral

213
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,720
arrangement by The Empty Vase.

214
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,680
They are my favorite florist
in Los Angeles, hands down.

215
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,020
And this is just breathtaking.

216
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,730
It is a very large floral structure

217
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,810
and it almost doesn't really,
I mean it looks so crazy.

218
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,250
It's almost like it's been copied

219
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,700
and pasted onto my kitchen.

220
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,100
I just got back from Sophia's house.

221
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,450
We filmed something for her channel

222
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,300
and I'm really excited
to see how it comes out

223
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,550
because there was choreography involved

224
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:28,530
and it's just gonna be a really
cool, colorful, quirky video

225
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,170
and I'm excited to see it come together.

226
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,410
But now I'm at home and I'm

227
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,520
dealing with a lot of adult stuff.

228
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,280
Like, I opened my mailbox and literally,

229
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,190
anything that I get in the
mailbox is either stuff

230
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,680
that I need to pay for or spam.

231
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,300
Like, I don't even know how I got

232
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:53,300
onto this random list for Grandin Road.

233
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:57,140
I think January or January,
February's a weird time of year

234
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:01,370
where all mail just gives me
anxiety because it's either

235
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,650
the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.

236
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,340
That's my dealio right now,
so I'm just dealing with this

237
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,080
so I don't have to think about it anymore.

238
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,670
I'm not a person that puts things off.

239
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,200
If something makes me uncomfortable,

240
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,450
like, I have to deal with it

241
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:20,250
and confront it because
my worst nightmare is

242
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,070
putting it off and then
forgetting about it

243
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,480
and then getting in trouble.

244
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,680
It is Monday today and I actually have

245
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,340
like a really chill day
and it feels so good.

246
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,340
This past week has been
so nuts and I feel like,

247
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,970
I feel like I was on
the edge of burning out,

248
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,370
but for some reason, I wasn't.

249
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,210
I think it's because
I feel pretty balanced

250
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,130
and I must say this meditation,
therapy, working out

251
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:51,130
bundle is working out for me pretty well.

252
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,930
I just cross my fingers
and hope to stay stable.

253
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,560
But yes, yesterday, I uploaded
my Q&A video with Ben.

254
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,240
It's going down really well.

255
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,670
I think a lot of you guys are

256
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,880
enjoying it which makes me super happy.

257
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,149
Later on tonight, I'm going
to Emily's house for a

258
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,380
Galentine's Day and that's
gonna be really fun.

259
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:15,260
I love my girlfriends so
much and I really prioritize

260
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,210
the friendships in my life.

261
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,985
- [Jenn] Oh, my God,
Happy Galentine's Day.

262
00:12:19,985 --> 00:12:20,818
- Happy Galentine's Day.

263
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:24,300
- [Jenn] Oh, my God, Revela
is cookin' up a feast.

264
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,750
A vegan feast.

265
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,460
Sherry's pourin' the wine.

266
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:31,360
Wow, we're gonna drink this all tonight.

267
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,330
- [Woman] All of it.

268
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,310
- [Jenn] This looks freaking delicious.

269
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,099
Damn, Sophie, are you gonna eat all that?

270
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,270
- [Sophie] I'll let you know.

271
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,620
- [Jenn] And there's salad.

272
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,027
- [Woman] I'm gonna sit right
next to the everything bagel.

273
00:12:47,027 --> 00:12:50,628
(group speaks in foreign language)

274
00:12:50,628 --> 00:12:51,600
- [Jenn] (speaks in
foreign language) everyone,

275
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,910
it is Tuesday.

276
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,860
I am currently in the car
driving to a couple of meetings.

277
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,600
First is with Fresh and
I'm really stoked because

278
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,040
I love their black tea line,

279
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,750
so I'm excited to see the rest of

280
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,440
the range of the products that they have.

281
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
And then I'm doing an interview

282
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,380
which would be really thrilling.

283
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,380
I was gonna say exciting,

284
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,180
but I'm trying to do a different
adjective besides that.

285
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,120
I think I'm kind of finally
getting in the swing of things

286
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,490
with interviews because most interviews,

287
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,830
they kind of ask you the same thing,

288
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,800
they're like how'd you get started,

289
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,380
what kind of videos do you do,

290
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,370
so I can easily talk
about that all day now.

291
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,880
But, it's so crazy,
even like two years ago,

292
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,280
I wouldn't even know how to answer

293
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,310
that question without stuttering.

294
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,910
Last night was so much fun.

295
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,040
We had a Galentine's Day at Emily's

296
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,520
and it was just so sweet that
she cooked for all of us.

297
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,096
I definitely want to return the favor.

298
00:13:42,096 --> 00:13:44,470
I feel like most of the times
when my girlfriends come over,

299
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:47,520
we just like PostMates
something or we eat out,

300
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,870
but there's nothing like
a home cooked dinner

301
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,710
and she's like inspiring
me to try new recipes

302
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:56,600
because I only know how
to make like four things

303
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,020
and I would like to expand that

304
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,390
to at least six things, you know?

305
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:04,140
I think I'm just really spoiled
because Ben does pretty much

306
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,080
all the cooking in the house,

307
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,372
so my cooking skills have
definitely deteriorated.

308
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:11,070
But I think I'm gonna cook dinner tonight.

309
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,270
I think I'm gonna make kimchi jjigae

310
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:15,250
because my (speaks in
foreign language), my aunt,

311
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,020
she made this delicious kimchi

312
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,170
I think it's ready to
be turned into a soup.

313
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,780
Kimchi jjigae is best when
the kimchi is a little older

314
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,050
and more fermented, I guess?

315
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,060
I don't know what the word is,

316
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,860
but it's better when it's more dank.

317
00:14:30,915 --> 00:14:33,498
(mellow music)

318
00:14:37,665 --> 00:14:40,248
(mellow music)

319
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,120
- Alright, it is time for dinner

320
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,010
and tonight I am making
kimchi jjigae with tuna.

321
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,950
I bought this can, I wanna
say, a couple months ago

322
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,740
and I know I should use it.

323
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,200
Normally, you're supposed
to make kimchi jjigae

324
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,660
with pork, but since I am
not eating pork anymore,

325
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,070
I am gonna go with good
old fashioned tuna.

326
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,020
And yeah, this tuna is
specifically made for kimchi jjigae

327
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,240
so I'm super excited to try it out.

328
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,290
So, I just grabbed this recipe online

329
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,660
and the first instruction is
to sauté this can of tuna.

330
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,700
Wow, woo, that's red.

331
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,480
And here I have this homemade
kimchi that my aunt made.

332
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,920
Oh my God, this is so
beautiful, look at this.

333
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,040
I haven't even touched this yet.

334
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,300
I've only had maybe like a portion or two

335
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,210
so I'm gonna put this in the stew.

336
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,990
It's gonna be delicious.

337
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,280
Oh my goodness, there is the
finished kimchi jjigae, yum!

338
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,860
And Ben is making fries.

339
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,180
- Chips. Crispy chips tonight.

340
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,200
So English and so Korean.

341
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,872
- [Jenn] I can't wait to
have a little bit of that.

342
00:15:52,872 --> 00:15:54,492
He's gonna have a little bit of this.

343
00:15:54,492 --> 00:15:55,325
- [Ben] Yeah.

344
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,620
- Today is Valentine's Day

345
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:01,330
and I woke up with this on my bedside.

346
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,240
Ben was off to a early gig today,

347
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,700
so he left me this note.

348
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,750
So, we'll see what's inside.

349
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:13,000
Aw, this is so cute.

350
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,830
It says "Good morning."

351
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:23,370
(laughs) Oh my God, this is
off to a great start already.

352
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:38,043
Oh my God, what is this (laughs)?

353
00:16:40,356 --> 00:16:43,000
(mellow music)

354
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,420
With (mumbles) again.

355
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,740
We've got a glass of champagne.

356
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,950
- [Ben] Sort of like a prosecco
vodka and blueberry mix.

357
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:56,310
We tried to copy what Steph
did with our sipping sister.

358
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,880
We didn't have some of the
ingredients, but we did this.

359
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,340
- [Jenn] Yeah, I think it's pretty close.

360
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,519
- It's nice.

361
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,990
Happy Valentine's Day, babe.
- Happy Valentine's Day.

362
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,680
- I love you.
- I love you.

363
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,930
- Oh, wow, that's great, that's fantastic.

364
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,630
I really get some awesome
notes of the vodka.

365
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:16,113
- I really taste the alcohol.

366
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:16,970
(Jenn laughs)

367
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,180
- [Jenn] Alright, so, another dish came.

368
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,460
This is the Kale Caesar Salad.

369
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,119
We've got the deviled eggs and a lasagna.

370
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,279
But Ben's in the restroom
right now, somewhere,

371
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,680
so I gotta refrain myself
from eating all this.

372
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:38,464
- [Man] So, if we want
somewhere in Orange County,

373
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:41,635
that is kinda like the new hotspot.

374
00:17:41,635 --> 00:17:45,385
- [Cell Phone] Welcome
to day nine of change.

375
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,160
- Hello, I'm shooting with Silas today.

376
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,490
We're doing a little Team Cozy shoot.

377
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:58,579
- [Silas] You look just
miserable (laughs).

378
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,329
- (laughs) Stop!

379
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:04,942
(mellow music)

380
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:11,521
(mellow music)

381
00:18:11,521 --> 00:18:14,050
I think this one is for me.

382
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,340
Look what we have here.

383
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,540
- It's a really sharp box.

384
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,390
- It is (laughs).

385
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:19,964
- Cute.
- Cute.

386
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:22,550
- Oh, my god, these are sick.

387
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,500
- They're so platformed.

388
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,388
- I know, I love a little bit of height.

389
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,956
- I love that too, actually.

390
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:29,531
- This is sick, thank you.

391
00:18:29,531 --> 00:18:31,710
Wow, check these out.

392
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:34,052
This is Stephanie's seat.

393
00:18:34,052 --> 00:18:35,452
And over here we've got moi.

394
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:38,500
It's a very recent photo.

395
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,626
I love it.

396
00:18:39,626 --> 00:18:42,209

(mellow music)

399
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,280
- [Jenn] At the park I brought Cheeky.

400
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,630
I'm hanging out with Julia.

401
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:03,880
She brought some snacks for us to eat.

402
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,713
This is her loot.

403
00:19:04,713 --> 00:19:08,650
We've got the roasted
garlic, some hummus, ooh.

404
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,483
- [Julia] Kale pesto.

405
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,120

406
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,030

- [Jenn] Oh, my God, so it works out.

408
00:19:13,634 --> 00:19:14,475
- [Julia] This is great.

409
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:15,649
I had it the other day.

410
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,214
- [Jenn] We're about to paint.

411
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:20,370
We're at a paint and sip event.

412
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,920
James is ready to get his paint on.

413
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:25,420
We've got some colors here.

414
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,003

I am going to lunch with The OG Crew,

It's like 75 degrees
