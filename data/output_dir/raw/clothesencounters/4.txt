1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,100
- You want me to powder you?

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,950
- I do look a bit shiny.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,560
- Okay, I'm just gonna
bring the powder down.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,650
- All right, we getting the powder.

5
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,379
Sort me out, make sure
we don't use this bit.

6
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:13,050
(pop music)

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,380
- Hi everyone!
- Hello.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,550
- And welcome back to my channel.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,326
Today, we have a very special guest, Ben.

10
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:21,660
If you somehow do not know
who he is, this is my man.

11
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,730
- Yeah, sorry about that, guys.

12
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,910
You're probably sick of me
by now, but here I am again.

13
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:26,430
- I thought it would be a really good time

14
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,050
to bring him in because Valentine's Day

15
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,290
is right around the corner.

16
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:31,450
So, we're doing a very fun,

17
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,440
relaxed Love and Relationship Q&A.

18
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,930
I went on Twitter and asked you guys

19
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,130
if you guys had any questions,

20
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,670
and we picked our favorite ones.

21
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,900
- There was some good questions.

22
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,186
- So, let's dive right in.

23
00:00:41,186 --> 00:00:44,600
- What are your respective love languages?

24
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,660
- Yeah, we picked this question out

25
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,320
because I literally had Ben take this test

26
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,600
maybe two months ago.
- Yeah, about two months ago.

27
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,200
- Yeah, so I thought the
results were really interesting.

28
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,780
I've always known my love language test

29
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,370
because I love quizzes.

30
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,280
I love the Meyers-Briggs test.

31
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,170
- I've never even heard of this test.

32
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,100
So it was quite fun to do.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,430
- Some of the questions were a bit odd.

34
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,346
It was like,

35
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,310
would you like a hug or get
a really expensive gift?

36
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,410
It feels like a trick question.

37
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:07,243
- Yeah, right?

38
00:01:07,243 --> 00:01:11,440
So, Ben's results were
quality time as number one.

39
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,790
Then, touch.

40
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,370
Words of affirmation.

41
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,717
Then, it was acts of service.

42
00:01:16,717 --> 00:01:18,850
Very last was gifts.

43
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:20,680
- Yeah, yours were?

44
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,650
- Quality time, number one.

45
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,060
So it's really important
to spend time with me.

46
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,010
Then it was acts of service.

47
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,060
So it really means a lot
when Ben does things for me.

48
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,060
Like cooking, opening the
packages, watering the grass.

49
00:01:33,447 --> 00:01:34,736
- You keep reeling off the list.

50
00:01:34,736 --> 00:01:35,820
- Yeah, I know.

51
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,670
Number three for me was
words of affirmation,

52
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,290
so we're both equal on that.

53
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,840
Fourth one is gifts,
and the last is touch.

54
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,740
I had no idea that this
meant so much to him.

55
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,710
Who would have thought?

56
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,060
- This means a lot right now.
(laughing)

57
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,023
- Second question comes
from Brittany Yann.

58
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:54,310
At first, did your
parents have a hard time

59
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,420
accepting your interracial relationships

60
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,160
or were they happy you were happy?

61
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,993
For the longest time,

62
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:01,120
my parents wanted me to
be with an Asian guy.

63
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,230
Love you two.

64
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,060
Thanks, Brittany.
- Good question.

65
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,910
- It's a very good question actually.

66
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,320
Honestly, Ben didn't meet
my parents until like a year

67
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,540
of us dating.
- It's been a year, yeah.

68
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,770
- Yeah, for me and my parents,

69
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,500
I was never the type to be
like this is who I'm dating.

70
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,960
It was always very separate.

71
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:22,160
With Ben, it felt like
something very serious.

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,840
So, after a year of dating,

73
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,470
Ben came over to my parents' house.

74
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,380
Everybody was there.

75
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,950
My mom, dad, and James.

76
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,460
- You have to remember as well,

77
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,300
for Jenn's parents to find
out their daughter is dating

78
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,370
a guy who's in a band with tattoos.

79
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,740
How far, five thousand
miles away does he live?

80
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,190
Great, yeah, date him.

81
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,690
So, there's a lot of things

82
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,160
that weren't really going in my favor.

83
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,400
- At first, they were like,
okay if he makes you happy,

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,930
because they couldn't get too mad

85
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,840
because we were already dating for a year.

86
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,270
So clearly he wasn't
just about to run away.

87
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,070
So, he knew that we were committed.

88
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,100
And I think it's just Ben's efforts

89
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,170
on always trying to impress my parents.

90
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,950
You'd always chat to my
dad about soccer or golf,

91
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,167
or pretty much anything.

92
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,000
- Eats all that food.

93
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,704
- Yeah, and eat all of my mom's food.

94
00:03:06,704 --> 00:03:07,537
- That's a problem.

95
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,050
- That's the way to my mom's heart,

96
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,130
is to eat her cooking.

97
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,300
I think it's really important

98
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,282
to just show your parents how much.

99
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:16,164
How do I say it?
- How happy you are.

100
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:16,997
- How happy you are.

101
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,380
- Because I think the main thing,

102
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,710
no matter what, every parents,

103
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,890
every family want you to be happy,

104
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,514
and if you can really show that.

105
00:03:24,514 --> 00:03:25,818
Then, I think that goes a long way.

106
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:26,940
- Yeah.
- I guess we're lucky

107
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,430
'cause your parents were more accepting

108
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,000
than maybe other parents might be.

109
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,950
- They see the person,

110
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,910
and beyond just the ethnicity.

111
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,440
- Tiffany asks,

112
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,390
would you and Ben have fallen in love

113
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:41,760
with each other if you
guys met as teenagers?

114
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,220
I like that question.
- I know, me too.

115
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,390
This is how I envision it.

116
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,270
We would be at a show, or
something, like a rock show,

117
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,240
and you would be playing
the drums, or you're,

118
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,840
the crowd or something.
- Yeah.

119
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,297
- Like, we just ran into each other.

120
00:03:53,297 --> 00:03:54,280
- I think because we were into

121
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,740
the same kind of music growing up,

122
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,510
like that kind of angst-y punk rock,

123
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,260
so probably like that.

124
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,189
And I was in bands when
I was 14 or something.

125
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:05,390
- It's just crazy 'cause
when we started dating,

126
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,337
it was insane to see our paths so similar.

127
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:09,170
- Yeah.

128
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,650
- Even though we lived in
complete different countries.

129
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,680
We had kind of like a similar adolescence.

130
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,644
- Yeah, we did.
- Yeah.

131
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:14,680
- But at the same time,

132
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,750
I'm happy we met

133
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,570
at this time in our lives.
- Now, yeah.

134
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,959
- If we would have been teenagers,
we might not be here now.

135
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,529
- Yeah, 'cause I feel like
when you're a teenager,

136
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,160
you're still kind of
figuring yourself out.

137
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,040
So I'm glad that we met now.

138
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,258
- We waited, yeah.
- Yeah.

139
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,660
So this next question is from Hafu.

140
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,960
If it's not too personal, how
do you guys settle conflict?

141
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,285
P.S. You two are goals.

142
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:34,270
Thank you.
- Thank you.

143
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,620
How do you settle conflict?

144
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,625
We're pretty good with the fact

145
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,459
that we always talk things through.

146
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:39,292
- Yeah.

147
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:41,210
- And make sure we never go to bed.

148
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,784
Very rarely did we go to bed angry.

149
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:44,848
- I think just one time
we went to bed angry.

150
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:45,681
- Yeah.

151
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:46,530
- It was not a good
morning the next morning

152
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,900
'cause it just transferred over.

153
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,733
- Yeah.

154
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,420
- So, it's good to always talk
it out before you go to bed.

155
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,640
- Yeah, and it's something we're learning

156
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,530
to kind of even make each
other feel validated,

157
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,840
and it's something that can be very easy.

158
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,250
If you're very opinionated or
you're annoyed with something,

159
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,590
it's very hard to see the
other person's perspective.

160
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,740
It's something where we're
definitely learning a lot.

161
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,810
- When an argument gets quite heated,

162
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,586
I'm not gonna lie, I'm
definitely a hot head.

163
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:13,419
- You can be.

164
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:16,240
- I know, I can be, but
I'm working on it so hard.

165
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,980
So we have this system

166
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,650
where it's kind of like
my happiness spectrum.

167
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,480
So, right now I'm green,
so everything's good.

168
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,599
Then, when it turns yellow,

169
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:27,880
I don't feel too good.
- On the edge.

170
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,713
- I'm on the edge.

171
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:29,546
If it's orange,

172
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,386
I'm already kind of
snapping back a little bit.

173
00:05:33,386 --> 00:05:36,250
I'm not angry, but I'm very close.

174
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,640
When I become orange,
I'll tell Ben I'm orange

175
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,840
'cause I've noticed that
when I get to orange,

176
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,650
I'm just looking for
a fight to get to red.

177
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,950
I think recognizing the
different spectrums of my mood

178
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,410
helps me catch myself.

179
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,557
Before we get to the arguing part,

180
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:53,080
it's good that Ben or
I just leave the room,

181
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,970
and we let it just cool off
for even like 30 minutes.

182
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,150
It really, really helps

183
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,960
because it helps you get
back to how you normally are.

184
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,210
- Well, you speak honestly as well

185
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,630
because when you're
hot-headed like anyone,

186
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,270
if you're angry, you have your walls up,

187
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,130
you feel defensive, you
don't listen as much.

188
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,820
Sometimes space is good,

189
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,653
you need time.
- Space is good.

190
00:06:13,653 --> 00:06:15,190
- Sometimes, me listening is good.

191
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,023
So me being there.

192
00:06:16,023 --> 00:06:17,530
It's about sort of judging it.

193
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,590
Obviously every situation,
everyone's different.

194
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,260
- I think at the end of the day,

195
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,360
I think once we're both
normalized, especially for me,

196
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,760
I can really hear Ben out.

197
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,910
That's what we all need.

198
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:28,820
We just need to be heard and validated,

199
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,140
even if we don't
necessarily agree with it,

200
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,540
as long as you hear the other person,

201
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,110
and you come to a compromise.

202
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,340
Then you're good.

203
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,630
- So the next question.

204
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,710
Did it intimidate you guys the
idea of going long distance

205
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,320
in the beginning of your relationship?

206
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,790
We get this question a lot.

207
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:49,218
It's amazing how many
people in the same position.

208
00:06:49,218 --> 00:06:50,680
Especially this day and age,

209
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,810
doing long distance, it's
happening a lot more, isn't it?

210
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,930
- Yeah, definitely, I think
we're the age of technology.

211
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,615
You can truly find a
suitable partner overseas.

212
00:06:58,615 --> 00:06:59,448
- Here I am.

213
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:01,520
It's never easy.

214
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,693
Long distance is something
that you live in limbo.

215
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,660
You don't know when you're
gonna see each other next.

216
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,990
You're so far away, so it's
very hard to feel connected.

217
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,340
- It's such a high and a low.

218
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,173
- Yeah.

219
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:13,221
- Because when you see
each other you're like.

220
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:14,571
- [Both] Ah!

221
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:16,550
- The last two days, it's like.

222
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,860
- Then you go home, and
you're literally so depressed.

223
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,860
So, it's cool to see love
in such an intense spectrum

224
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,160
'cause you get the highest high.

225
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,190
Like when I would see you at the airport

226
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,580
after not seeing you for like a month.

227
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,440
Just like packing up my things
and going to the airport.

228
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,930
That was the best, most
exciting plane rides of my life

229
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,197
was going to see you.

230
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:40,030
- Absolutely.

231
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,840
Long distance you have to
make that extra effort.

232
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,010
You have to really want to make it work

233
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,280
because it can vary.

234
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,710
If you don't feel connected
for even a few days,

235
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,360
it's very important to make
sure you go far and beyond

236
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,520
for each other to make
yourself feel connected.

237
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,790
Trying to Skype as often as you can.

238
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,900
Especially England to L.A.,

239
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,090
it's like an eight-hour difference,

240
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,910
so a matter of like four,
five a.m. calls would do.

241
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,754
One of us would be drunk, one
would be going to the gym.

242
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:04,790
(laughing)

243
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,623
- Our clocks were a little bit off,

244
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:07,670
but we always made time for each other,

245
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,950
and I think your trust needs to be there.

246
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,430
I feel like trust is built
by feeling connected.

247
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,692
Send a little text of what
we were eating that day.

248
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:18,210
- Even in the morning.
- Or a voicemail, yeah!

249
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,390
- Waking up to a message
saying I'm thinking of you.

250
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,980
Simple as that.
- Something like that.

251
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,260
- It's the little things
like that that go a long way.

252
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,410
- I think the thing with
long distance relationships

253
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,090
is that there needs to be a time

254
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,760
when you guys finally settle in together.

255
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,190
Whether it's a three-year
mark, a five-year mark.

256
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,590
- You won't always see that
end goal straight away.

257
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,840
Even for me, I was in
England, I was in a band.

258
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,325
I left the band and moved to L.A.

259
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:44,960
It's so much change and
it's very easy to think,

260
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,793
I can't do that,

261
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:47,260
I'm doing this, I'm
doing that, I live here.

262
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,600
You're always gonna have those walls

263
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
and the things you can't do,

264
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,960
but at the end of the day,

265
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,170
if you're in love and you
wanna be with that person,

266
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,670
that's the main thing.

267
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,570
Your family and friends,
everyone will support you

268
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,970
because it's about happiness
at the end of the day.

269
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,180
So I think that's important.

270
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,490
Very good question.

271
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,520
- So, this one is from Valencia.

272
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,354
Ben, please say something
to Jenn in Korean.

273
00:09:09,354 --> 00:09:11,790
(Ben speaks in foreign language)

274
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,330
- If it's someone's birthday
as well, I'm all about that.

275
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,840
(Ben speaks in foreign language)

276
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,090
There's not much more than that.

277
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,146
It's very hard.
- Pretty impressive.

278
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:22,041
(Ben speaks in foreign language)

279
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:23,061
- That's about it really.

280
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:24,268
- Do you know how to say goodbye?

281
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:28,170
(Ben speaks in foreign language)

282
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,301
Which is the difference?

283
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:30,134
(Ben speaks in foreign language)

284
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,787
- Someone is leaving your house.

285
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:32,690
(Ben speaks in foreign language)

286
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,810
Means when you're leaving their house.

287
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:35,930
By the time I've realized,

288
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,960
as we're leaving someone's house,

289
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,509
I'm like, oh, wait.

290
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,980
See you later.
(laughing)

291
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,110
- So this next question comes from Saska.

292
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,130
If you guys swapped bodies for a day,

293
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,821
Freaky Friday style, what would you do?

294
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:50,654
- That is a very good question.

295
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,040
- I already know what I'm gonna do.

296
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,550
I would love to finally have
rhythm, and be able to drum.

297
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,376
That would be so cool.

298
00:09:58,376 --> 00:10:00,470
To do that thing with the sticks.

299
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,410
- Yeah, you've tried even my kit before.

300
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,950
- Really hard, I know, it's really hard.

301
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,330
- So you would drum.
- Yes, I would drum.

302
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,163
- That's good.

303
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:08,160
What would I?

304
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,070
It would nice to kind of

305
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,500
just be pretty for the day, you know?

306
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,640
Got the hair going on, you know?

307
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,473
Dress on.

308
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:15,306
(laughing)

309
00:10:15,306 --> 00:10:16,690
So, Jean asks.

310
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,920
What's the thing, joke
that only both of you gets?

311
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,881
We got so many.

312
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:24,002
- I know, we really have so many.

313
00:10:24,002 --> 00:10:25,350
I don't know where to get started.

314
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,650
- And then, most of them are just so weird

315
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:27,650
or don't make any sense,

316
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,150
so you can't even explain it.
- I know.

317
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,230
- [Both] Psst, psst, psst.

318
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,130
- We've got a little name for our.

319
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,963
- We have a theme song.

320
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:34,972
- A theme song.
- Yeah.

321
00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:36,440
- We are the Ruse.
- You wanna sing it?

322
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,010
Here, this is your mic.

323
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,032
All right.

324
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,193
♪ We are the ruse ♪

325
00:10:40,193 --> 00:10:41,050

(laughing)

331
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,420
- Nickel asks, can you guys
read each other's minds?

332
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,047
Love you long time Jenns and Bens.

333
00:10:59,047 --> 00:10:59,880
- Nice.
- Thank you.

334
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,950
- We can a little bit, can't we?

335
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,820
- Yeah, 100%.

336
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,520
The instant Ben is feeling something,

337
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,980
especially negatively, I know.

338
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,813
I'm like, what's wrong?

339
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:09,330
What can I do to help?

340
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,180
Always.
- Yeah.

341
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,270
It's definitely the same
the other way around.

342
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,750
Even with board games when
we play with our friends.

343
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,770
- The Werewolves game.

344
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,140
- Yeah.
- Where someone is the killer,

345
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,528
and you're supposed to have a poker face,

346
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:20,990
- Yeah.
- And lie to everybody.

347
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,034
- I'd be like, Jenn are you the killer?

348
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:23,410
She'd be like, no.

349
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,243
I'm like, she's the killer,

350
00:11:24,243 --> 00:11:25,600
and vice versa.
- Well, yeah!

351
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,610
When you were the killer,

352
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,990
I held your hand and I was like,

353
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,170
babe, are you the killer?

354
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,456
- Everyone was accusing me of
being the killer, and I was.

355
00:11:31,456 --> 00:11:32,500
- He was the killer.

356
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,558
- So I squeezed her hand because.

357
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,917
- Yeah, why would you
squeeze my hand so tight?

358
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,444
- I didn't mean to the tension,

359
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:38,210
I was angry that everyone was accusing me

360
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,440
of being the killer.
- You can't lie to me.

361
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,940
- They were right, so.

362
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,580
- The last question comes from Victoria.

363
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,050
What has been a challenge
that you two have overcome

364
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,778
in your relationship and
how did you get through it?

365
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:51,270
- Probably the long distance to moving in.

366
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,710
- Yeah!

367
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,750
That transition was kinda tricky

368
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,080
'cause we went from not seeing each other

369
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,410
for most of the time to all of the time.

370
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,880
I feel like the first
three weeks were awesome

371
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,260
'cause we were like, this is amazing.

372
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,460
We get to hang out all the time.

373
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,680
- When you move in with someone,

374
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,150
regardless if it was long distance or not,

375
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:14,110
it's about knowing your
roles and your boundaries.

376
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,770
- Yeah, I think it's really
important to establish rules.

377
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,120
So, for example, in the house,

378
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,040
Ben will cook our meals

379
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,330
and I will always wash up the dishes.

380
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,530
Then, I will always do
laundry and fold it,

381
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,600
and Ben will always do garden work.

382
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,323
Yeah.
- Little things like that.

383
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:31,156
- And we have a whole list.

384
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:33,050
That way, we never fight about like,

385
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,070
why didn't you do this?

386
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,903
Why didn't you do that?

387
00:12:34,903 --> 00:12:35,736
Because we know

388
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:38,036
as long as you fulfill
your roles and your tasks,

389
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:39,080
then you're good.

390
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,510
- These little things that can build up.

391
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,100
You don't say, and you think in your mind.

392
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,840
It's okay, he's done it again, has he?

393
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,430
Yeah, okay, oh, he's done it again.

394
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,830
And then it builds up and you're screaming

395
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,970
about something so small and insignificant

396
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,250
when you could have just talked
about it in the first place.

397
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,768
It's about being compatible.

398
00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:55,930
- And sane boundaries

399
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:58,850
when we're both at a good green level.

400
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,630
- You don't wanna scream like, do this!

401
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,840
Okay I agree with you.

402
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,970
That doesn't happen.
- No.

403
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,305
- That has not happened.

404
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:05,373
- It completely makes sense.

405
00:13:05,373 --> 00:13:06,460
I'm sorry for what I did!

406
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,240
- You're the best person I've ever met!

407
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,620
No one has ever had that argument.

408
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,453
- All right guys,

409
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:13,910
that is a wrap on our
Love and Relationship Q&A.

410
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,960
If you guys have any
other questions for us,

411
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,660
please write it in the
comments down below.

412
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,910
We would love to answer them.

413
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,900
Perhaps, Ben will join us again.

414
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,733
- This was fun.

415
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,810
It was easy and it was nice

416
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,992
to have some almost back and forth.

417
00:13:25,992 --> 00:13:28,240
- Yeah, this was so easy to film.

418
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,020
We're just filming on a Friday night,

419
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,000
with some drinks.

420
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,249
It's been a great bonding activity.

421
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:35,320
- It's nice to spend
Friday night with you all.

422
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,350
- If you want more of Ben,

423
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,830
please check out his YouTube channel.

424
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,570
I will leave it in the description box.

425
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,880
It is so good, and he's
worked so hard on it.

426
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,040
I'm so proud of him.
- That's right.

427
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,100
- Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching,

428
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,888
and we'll see you guys in the next one.

429
00:13:46,888 --> 00:13:47,721
Bye!

430
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,830
- Bye guys, I wanna do it.

431
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,040
Thumbnail photo.

432
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,290
- This is too much.

433
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,510
Complete my heart.

434
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:57,722
- Like that, no, I'm not using this.

435
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:59,222
- We need options.

436
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:01,612
Good job!

437
00:14:02,929 --> 00:00:00,000
(pop music)
