1
00:00:00,186 --> 00:00:02,769
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,190
- Hey everybody!

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,240
It's your girl Jenn and welcome back.

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:10,530
Today I have a very large
thrift haul for you.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,180
Because in my previous
video, where I get ready,

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,700
I asked you guys what types
of videos you like to see

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,020
and a ton of y'all were like,

8
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,770
"Bring back the thrifting videos!"

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,990
So, I went to my Goodwill
Outlet Center and it was

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,070
actually my first time at the outlet.

11
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:27,430
And an outlet and a normal
Goodwill store is different

12
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,260
because when you go to the outlet,

13
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,390
there are no price tags on anything.

14
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:33,720
Everything just comes in a
big blue bin and you just

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,330
kinda have to fend for yourself
and at the end when you

16
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:40,090
checkout they just weigh
everything and roughly every item

17
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,960
comes out to like a dollar or two dollars.

18
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,090
But if you get like a heavy
jacket maybe it'll be like

19
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,090
five bucks but regardless you get a deal.

20
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,560
But it's definitely intense.

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,750
I wanna show you guys
all the goodies I got,

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,010
so let me know you my loot.

23
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,050
First up, I want to talk about this white

24
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,490
sweater I purchased, this
is by Zara Man and I love

25
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,080
that it's oversized and super comfy.

26
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:03,610
It's kind of got like
an athletic feel to it

27
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:06,260
because of the two thick
black stripes in the arms

28
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,060
and it just sits really
comfortably on the body.

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,260
I was debating whether I
wanted to crop it or not

30
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,450
but I decided against it
because I like the length.

31
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,230
It hits mid-thigh and it
looks so cute with some

32
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,880
thigh high socks and a beanie.

33
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,470
All in all this a really
casual comfortable piece

34
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,180
to add to my wardrobe.

35
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:26,140
Coming up next, I've got
this lovely red jacket.

36
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,790
This is very boxy and cropped
and I love the silhouette.

37
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,540
It's got kind of like a denim jacket but

38
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,220
instead of denim its in
like a wool material.

39
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:37,740
I absolutely love the color red and I love

40
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,380
pairing it with outfits that I think are

41
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,160
too plain or need a little extra oomph.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,170
See here we have a very
large striped polo.

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,300
This is definitely
something my dad might wear.

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,490
Maybe that's why I like it.

45
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,340
It's got kind of like
a familiar feel to it

46
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,080
and it's also something that
I feel like Unif might carry.

47
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,550
This print is very like teenage skater boy

48
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,650
from the 90s and I love it.

49
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,120
I would rock it with the
buttons all the way up

50
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,740
and untucked with some trousers.

51
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,600
I feel like it would give off
some cool androgynous vibes.

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,850
Moving on to something
more feminine and flowy,

53
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,270
here I have this floral blouse that is

54
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,410
definitely channeling OG Sarah vibes.

55
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,710
I feel like she would have thrifted

56
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,360
a shirt like this and I love this print.

57
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,860
It's got pops of red, it's got polka dots,

58
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,030
and it's a little gody but I love it.

59
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,870
I noticed that a couple of
the buttons were missing

60
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,176
and so I decided to knot it
and I feel like it really

61
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:30,730
just elevates the whole look
and makes it more modern.

62
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,870
So I've got another flowy item.

63
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:36,670
This is a beautiful black
floral dress and I'm just gonna

64
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,110
call this my dinner date dress
because it's sleek and sexy.

65
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,610
And definitely something
I would rock on a night

66
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,070
that I wanna be more dolled up.

67
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,100
I love maxi dresses that have an

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,510
asymmetrical hemline
because generally I just

69
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,500
think its more flattering on petite girls.

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,420
That way you're not
drowning in the fabric.

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,130
I also love the subtle white floral

72
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,930
embroidery on the bottom of the hem.

73
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,880
I feel like if I wore it with
like a white baby doll tshirt,

74
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,810
it would work really really well.

75
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,100
My next item is this sick wind breaker.

76
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,300
I love the pattern because it
reminds me of an oil slick.

77
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,010
It's got all the colors in one,

78
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:11,230
like the moss green, the
purple, the burnt sienna,

79
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,440
and I just think it looks very retro.

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,190
It's kind of in the silhouette
of a member's only jacket,

81
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,330
but this is a lot more light weight.

82
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,590
In fact, this a really great
like summer night jacket

83
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,170
because you can just kind
of scrunch it up like this

84
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,720
and just stuff it in your purse.

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,400
And when it gets cold at
night you can unravel it

86
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,620
and be warm, and look stylin'.

87
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,630
So I'm pretty sure that
this next item is from

88
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,800
the children's section.

89
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,760
This a tiny graphic tee for
a soccer league and the shirt

90
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,910
fits like a baby doll tee
and I think it's so cute.

91
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,270
It's in that thick material cotton turns

92
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,580
when it's been washed so many times.

93
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,870
I love the tiny graphic on the side and

94
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,950
the large statement image on the back.

95
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,790
And I'm just a sucker for athletic wear

96
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,970
even though I wasn't very sporty as a kid.

97
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,020
I was in track for like a
year, but that's about it.

98
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,210
So yeah, I'll spend the
rest of my adulthood

99
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,070
collecting little athletic tees like this.

100
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,930
So I've got a couple
of bottoms at the store

101
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,620
and the first pair I wanna talk about

102
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,160
are these black chino pants.

103
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,880
These are also children's/tween clothes.

104
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,130
Yeah it says the size 10 in husky.

105
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,610
They remind me of Dickies,
but I like how they're cropped

106
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,220
and I just generally think
that these are a better fit.

107
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,060
These are great for me when I want

108
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,800
to take a break from jeans.

109
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
This next item, I'm
super stoked on because

110
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,840
I found American Apparel denim pants.

111
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,450
These fit pretty similar
to me as the disco pant,

112
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,290
but these actually work better on me

113
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:38,730
because they're more cropped.

114
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:42,140
They fit right at the
ankle and I just love this.

115
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,810
This is just really exciting
for me because I remember

116
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,650
when American Apparel was poppin'.

117
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:49,470
I used to wake up super early
for their warehouse sales

118
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,230
and wait in line with all my friends.

119
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:54,940
Just to get like defective
American Apparel clothing.

120
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,330
I am very happy that I now found
the jeans for a dollar now,

121
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,350
so we've come a long way.

122
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,630
So this next item I scooped
up for Ben actually,

123
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,770
in hopes that he'd like it.

124
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,600
I love this type of tartan.

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,000
It's very like true to
the lumberjack style.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,540
It's thick, I just think
it looks really worn in.

127
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,280
It looks very vintage but it's actually

128
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,680
from Abercrombie & Fitch.

129
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,920
I think this is a really
great layering device.

130
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,010
I feel like flannel will
never go out of style

131
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:21,730
and so that's why I wanted
to add this to my collection.

132
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,380
So the last item I have
is this floral robe.

133
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,700
It's in a very clean, cream color.

134
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,840
It's got this vibrant,
yellow floral embroidery

135
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,790
on the lapels and the sleeves and

136
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,850
overall looks very very regal.

137
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,530
I know that this is going to
be an amazing beach cover up

138
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,200
or just a shawl to put
over summer dresses.

139
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,030
It used to have shoulder pads
but I just snipped them off

140
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,710
to make it look more modern.

141
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,350
Alright everyone that
concludes my one dollar haul.

I'm also gonna be styling
all these items in like

145
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,950
a $40 outfit challenge video because

146
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:58,640
I can easily make outfits out of these.

147
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,350
They're all gonna be under 40
bucks, so stay tuned for that.

148
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,190
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching

149
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,894

Bye!

151
00:06:06,686 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
