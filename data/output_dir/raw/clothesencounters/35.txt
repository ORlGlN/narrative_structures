1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,697
(calm music)

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:07,430
- Hi, guys!

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,416
It is Monday.

4
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:11,974
Welcome to the first day of
the September Part Two vlog.

5
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:15,405
It's 5:42 p.m. and things
have finally calmed down

6
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,583
but I've just had so much work to do.

7
00:00:17,583 --> 00:00:21,750
I turned in my rough cut for
my 24 hours in New York video

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,887
and then I filmed this fall makeup look

9
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:26,552
which I am rocking right now.

10
00:00:26,552 --> 00:00:27,709
I love it.

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:30,230
I just feel like it really
goes well with the bangs.

12
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,329
This fall makeup look is due tomorrow

13
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:34,941
so I'm gonna spend pretty
much the entire evening

14
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:36,071
editing this guy.

15
00:00:36,071 --> 00:00:39,395
Also I got metal straws finally!

16
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:41,218
You guys proud of me?

17
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,145
It's something I've been wanting
to get for the longest time

18
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:45,064
because I like drinking out of straws

19
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:47,482
because I don't want to stain my teeth

20
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:49,789
and I drink a lot of coffee, a lot of tea,

21
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:52,308
so the straw really helps.

22
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:54,022
But anyway, I'm gonna
continue to chug along

23
00:00:54,022 --> 00:00:55,489
and I'll talk to you guys in a bit.

24
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,379
So I'm just taking a
little break from editing

25
00:00:57,379 --> 00:00:59,926
and I wanted to show you
guys the gifts that I got

26
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:02,374
at the housewarming party Ben and I threw

27
00:01:02,374 --> 00:01:04,207
on last week, I think?

28
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:06,597
Yeah.

29
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:09,382
And everyone like brought
gifts and it was so nice.

30
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:11,056
I like really wasn't expecting it.

31
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:13,113
We had never seen our house that full.

32
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,332
There was over 50 people in our house

33
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:18,169
and it was cool going to like
every story of our place,

34
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:20,373
seeing everybody get along and hanging out

35
00:01:20,373 --> 00:01:22,429
and just having a good time.

36
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:24,972
And I just wanted to
showcase the gifts that I got

37
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:27,171
because they were just so thoughtful.

38
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,615
The first item is this.

39
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:30,896
This is a picture frame that
my friend Jonathan gave me.

40
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:32,785
I think this is my 25th birthday

41
00:01:32,785 --> 00:01:34,029
and these are all my high school friends.

42
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:37,312
I've known Brianne
since I was five though.

43
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:38,145
Or six?

44
00:01:38,145 --> 00:01:39,627
I met her in the first grade

45
00:01:39,627 --> 00:01:41,327
and we're still friends today.

46
00:01:41,327 --> 00:01:43,556
But it's so cute, I love it.

47
00:01:43,556 --> 00:01:47,338
The second gift I have is this Palo Santo.

48
00:01:47,338 --> 00:01:49,492
I believe this is kind of like sage

49
00:01:49,492 --> 00:01:51,239
and you're supposed to like light it up

50
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,128
and you're supposed to,
I don't know, get rid

51
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:57,599
of any demons or bad juju in the house?

52
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:00,289
Palo Santo literally means holy wood.

53
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:02,213
Shamans and healers traditionally burn it

54
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:05,153
for its energetic purification
and healing attributes

55
00:02:05,153 --> 00:02:06,889
much like sage.

56
00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:08,395
Bingo.

57
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,674
This is from Teresa.

58
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:12,226
She couldn't physically
be here but Voo made sure

59
00:02:12,226 --> 00:02:13,172
to give this to us.

60
00:02:13,172 --> 00:02:14,252
So thanks, Teresa!

61
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:15,767
This next gift is from Sophia.

62
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:18,426
She got us this beautiful chip bowl.

63
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,340
Me and Ben are always hosting parties

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,402
so this is gonna be great
to, you know, put the chips

65
00:02:23,402 --> 00:02:25,061
and then put the guac in here.

66
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,478
This is gorgeous.

67
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:29,755
Looks like a hat.

68
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,600
Okay, and then she also
got Ben this apron.

69
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,348
Ben's always cooking and splattering stuff

70
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:40,932
so this is gonna be perfect
for him when he cooks.

71
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:45,112
It also looks like a
really cute dress (laughs).

72
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:47,195
Now for Stephanie's gift.

73
00:02:48,278 --> 00:02:51,253
She got us this beautiful aloe vera plant.

74
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:54,488
Unfortunately this is the
only pot we have to fit it

75
00:02:54,488 --> 00:02:57,401
and I feel like it's gonna
outgrow this pot pretty soon

76
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,990
but it looks awesome.

77
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:01,323
If we ever get sunburn or...

78
00:03:02,542 --> 00:03:04,705
Yeah, if we ever get
sunburned, we can chop it off

79
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,753
and put the aloe vera all over the wound.

80
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,180
So this is awesome.

81
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,731
And it just looks like a work of art.

82
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,908
It kind of looks like something
from Beetlejuice, huh?

83
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:13,845
The next gift is from Waylee and Wa.

84
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:17,496
They got me this beautiful diffuser.

85
00:03:17,496 --> 00:03:19,018
I'm gonna open it actually.

86
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,219
I'm so excited.

87
00:03:20,219 --> 00:03:23,170
I love things that just make
the house smell nice, you know?

88
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,482
They got me this beautiful diffuser.

89
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:28,602
They got me this soy candle,
it's called Dawn Cube.

90
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:29,760
Thank you guys!

91
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,393
I might as well just feature
all the other candles

92
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:34,507
but this is a candle that
Emily got me and Ben.

93
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,955
This one is for Ben actually

94
00:03:35,955 --> 00:03:39,738
because she chose the more
masculine scent for him.

95
00:03:39,738 --> 00:03:43,504
This one is vanilla husk and sandalwood

96
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:47,384
and it definitely smells,
it just smells like a man

97
00:03:47,384 --> 00:03:49,447
but a good man.

98
00:03:49,447 --> 00:03:51,458
This next candle I do
not know who got for me

99
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,946
because it didn't have a card.

100
00:03:52,946 --> 00:03:57,057
But this is a Kush candle,
so there's cannibis in here.

101
00:03:57,057 --> 00:03:58,616
But (coughs).

102
00:03:58,616 --> 00:03:59,965
Doesn't smell like it at all.

103
00:03:59,965 --> 00:04:04,571
It just smells more like tulip
actually, tulip and amber.

104
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,820
Next up, I have these
coasters from Jolene.

105
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,069
Thank you so much.

106
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:11,880
These are just beautiful marble coasters

107
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,015
in this one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

108
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:17,526
Octagon shape, and I've got four of them

109
00:04:17,526 --> 00:04:20,846
so this is gonna be great
for saving my countertops.

110
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,758
Then from Andrea, she gave me
this gorgeous orchid plant.

111
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:26,492
It's holding up pretty
well, I'm very surprised.

112
00:04:26,492 --> 00:04:28,934
And my battery's about to
die so let me go change that.

113
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:30,842
I believe this is also from Andrea

114
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:32,769
but I haven't opened it yet.

115
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,088
Oh, okay, oops, I forgot to
show you guys the packaging.

116
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:38,635
She taped a little
sprig of lavender on it.

117
00:04:38,635 --> 00:04:39,468
Oh, nice!

118
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:41,570
Okay.

119
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,531
And she got me this huge torpedo of sage.

120
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:47,252
But yeah, I believe you're
supposed to burn this

121
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:50,354
and it's supposed to
purify the space as well.

122
00:04:50,354 --> 00:04:51,950
Thank you, Andrea!

123
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,442
Alright, so this gift
is from Aaron and Jamie

124
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:57,592
and I believe it's one of his prints.

125
00:04:57,592 --> 00:04:59,755
So excited to see this.

126
00:04:59,755 --> 00:05:00,848
Wow.

127
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:01,765
Whoa, cool!

128
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,372
Oh my god, this is so freaking sick.

129
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:08,883
I love Aaron Kai's work.

130
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:12,720
It's very colorful,
psychedelic, and shroomy.

131
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,091
Can't wait to hang this up somewhere.

132
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,919
This is so beautiful.

133
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,691
Thank you so much, you guys.

134
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,999
And I also have one last gift.

135
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:20,523
This is from Rebecca.

136
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,184
We already framed it on the wall

137
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:25,827
but it is a photo that she
took at our engagement party

138
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:27,330
and it is amazing.

139
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:30,412
It finally replaced the Flying Lotus flyer

140
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:32,557
that I've had since college.

141
00:05:32,557 --> 00:05:34,484
So this is a lot more sentimental.

142
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:36,183
So thank you so much, Becca!

143
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,034
And then we also got a ton of alcohol

144
00:05:38,034 --> 00:05:41,550
so we're pretty much
stashed for, you know,

145
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,874
probably end of the year (laughs).

146
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:44,626
So Ben went grocery shopping today

147
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:47,588
and he brought back something
that we normally don't have

148
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:49,492
in the cabinet.

149
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:51,204
He got a wild card item

150
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:53,472
which are Everything Bagels.

151
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:56,391
And I haven't had a bagel, well,

152
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:59,312
I haven't had bagels in the
house since I was like a kid.

153
00:05:59,312 --> 00:06:03,140
Actually like got too
excited and I ate half of it

154
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
while it was still cold.

155
00:06:09,358 --> 00:06:13,909
For tonight's menu, Ben
is making shrimp tacos!

156
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:15,195
- Very excited about this.

157
00:06:15,195 --> 00:06:17,845
Usually we do it with tilapia fish.

158
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,232
Shrimp today.

159
00:06:19,232 --> 00:06:23,906
We got some guac, we got
some yogurts and sriracha.

160
00:06:23,906 --> 00:06:25,656
Cabbage and cilantro.

161
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,320
- And a glass of white wine.

162
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,521
How many avocados did
you use for the guac?

163
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,356
- One.

164
00:06:32,356 --> 00:06:33,287
- Wow.

165
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:34,481
Bang for your buck, huh?

166
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,162
- Bang for your buck.

167
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,026
(mumbles) like the yogurt but let's see.

168
00:06:38,026 --> 00:06:41,301
We got so many sauces so
there's some sriracha here.

169
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,801
I put it in the sauce as well.

170
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,978
- I'm pretty sure this
is the perfect amount.

171
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:52,481
This is the finished shrimp taco.

172
00:06:52,481 --> 00:06:54,697
(laughs)

173
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:56,864
(mumbles)

174
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,956
(calm music)

175
00:07:09,575 --> 00:07:10,408
Okay.

176
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:18,279
(audio fast-forwarding)

177
00:07:29,186 --> 00:07:30,103
Hi, Cheeki.

178
00:07:31,377 --> 00:07:32,607
Oh my god.

179
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,505
Look what just came in the mail.

180
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:37,572
This is from Ashley and Vanan.

181
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:39,974
And this is the biggest bouquet
of flowers I've ever seen

182
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:41,154
in my entire life.

183
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:41,987
Jesus.

184
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,494
It's so big!

185
00:07:44,494 --> 00:07:46,555
So on top, there's a giant bouquet

186
00:07:46,555 --> 00:07:49,936
and underneath there's
like this water tank

187
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:54,429
with orchids inside and
then there's rocks and sand.

188
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:57,552
And this is from my favorite
flower shop, The Empty Vase.

189
00:07:57,552 --> 00:07:58,441
It's Wednesday.

190
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:01,199
I'm doing the exact same
thing as I did yesterday.

191
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,254
Working.

192
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:06,152
And yesterday Ben and I filmed
our Google Assistant video.

193
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:10,642
I tried to vlog but that whole
video is a vlog in itself

194
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,651
so that's why there's just a gap.

195
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:17,266
Today I am just finishing
up the last touches.

196
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,189
I am feeling good though

197
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:22,268
because I am checking off
everything off my list.

198
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:26,960
There's nothing more satisfying
than checking boxes off.

199
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,007
I haven't been to the gym in a little bit

200
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:32,703
so I'm kind of feeling
a little cabin fevery.

201
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:36,092
Later on, I'm gonna go
get dinner with my family

202
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:38,691
for my early birthday dinner.

203
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:40,125
We're gonna have Korean food.

204
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,197
What a shock!

205
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,895
Honestly, my mom genuinely
doesn't like any other food

206
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:47,467
besides Korean and that
just mind boggles me.

207
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:49,299
She doesn't even like pizza.

208
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:51,816
She likes spaghetti and steak.

209
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,629
I took her to Boiling Point one time,

210
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,616
which is like my favorite hot pot place.

211
00:08:56,616 --> 00:08:57,910
I was watching her eat the soup

212
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,634
and it was just so underwhelming for her.

213
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:02,768
And it's just freaking bizarre, man.

214
00:09:02,768 --> 00:09:04,213
I think it's because when she was a kid,

215
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,505
she really didn't have anything
other than Korean food.

216
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,241
But the thing is, even food
that I didn't eat growing up,

217
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,434
I still like.

218
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:13,499
For example, I didn't have Indian food

219
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,249
until I was maybe 18.

220
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:19,040
I didn't have dim sum until I was 19

221
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,710
and you know, that's obviously
one of my favorite foods.

222
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,543
So I don't know.

223
00:09:22,543 --> 00:09:23,719
Maybe it's like a preference thing.

224
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:24,838
What do you guys think?

225
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,783
Is your favorite food
something that you grew up with

226
00:09:27,783 --> 00:09:31,063
or is it something that you
just had later on in your life?

227
00:09:31,063 --> 00:09:32,278
Alright, a little update.

228
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:33,711
It is 2:00.

229
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,544
I am going to the gym.

230
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,915
It is the last thing I want to do.

231
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:43,235
But I haven't been to
the gym in like five days

232
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:46,996
and my brain could really
use some endorphins.

233
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:48,753
And I know I really don't want to go

234
00:09:48,753 --> 00:09:52,564
but I know after I'm gonna feel amazing

235
00:09:52,564 --> 00:09:54,537
and I'm gonna wash my hair

236
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,242
and I'm gonna have fresh hair for today.

237
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,347
So let's go.

238
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,685
I'm gonna bring this
little vlogging camera.

239
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:00,809
Okay, I'm off.

240
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,226
(calm music)

241
00:10:11,838 --> 00:10:14,505
(water running)

242
00:10:15,493 --> 00:10:16,467
Yeah.

243
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,732
(sighs) I feel like a new woman.

244
00:10:18,732 --> 00:10:21,997
Oh my gosh, this is literally
the best feeling ever,

245
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,695
how you feel after you take a shower.

246
00:10:23,695 --> 00:10:24,876
I'm just gonna get a wide tooth comb

247
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:29,773
and I'm just gonna start brushing
my hair out a little bit.

248
00:10:29,773 --> 00:10:31,713
Just so it's not too tangled.

249
00:10:31,713 --> 00:10:35,467
Then I'm just gonna get It's
a 10 Miracle Leave In product.

250
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,717
And I'm just gonna spray this all over.

251
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,235
I just like this because it
doesn't get all over my hands

252
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,902
and it's just super easy to use.

253
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:50,434
I'm just gonna show you guys
what I do with my bangs.

254
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:57,293
They're already so long.

255
00:10:57,293 --> 00:10:58,698
Don't kill me, Anna.

256
00:10:58,698 --> 00:11:01,865
My bangs are still a mystery to style.

257
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,012
I'm just gonna let that calm down.

258
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:11,179
The best drink in the world, La Croix.

259
00:11:14,281 --> 00:11:15,527
Oh my god, it's so good.

260
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:18,602
I just got this new Charlotte
Tilbury eye shadow palette

261
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:20,898
and it is gorgeous!

262
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:22,944
It kind of just looks like--

263
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,228
Okay, thank god.

264
00:11:24,228 --> 00:11:26,602
I didn't want to dig my
nail into the shadows

265
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,700
like I did with the
Fenty Beauty highlighter.

266
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,533
I didn't.

267
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,848
They even categorized the
different eye shadow looks

268
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,966
that you can do, so this
one is day eye, dusk eye,

269
00:11:34,966 --> 00:11:37,740
date eye, and disco eye.

270
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,850
I don't know what is
calling my name though.

271
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,799
I think I'm just gonna hop
around and see what happens.

272
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,736
- [Cal] Does being exceptional require

273
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:46,390
an exceptional amount of work?

274
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:49,140
By Cal Newport of calnewport.com.

275
00:11:53,603 --> 00:11:55,318
- [Jenn] We are at Mr. Bossam.

276
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:57,180
There's my brother James.

277
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,263
Virgo season!

278
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:00,383
Hi, Appa!

279
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,216
- Hi.

280
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,016
- [Jenn] There's Eomma.

281
00:12:03,016 --> 00:12:03,914
- Hi.

282
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:05,561
- And then yours truly.

283
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:06,883
- Hi, guys.

284
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:08,193
Very happy.

285
00:12:08,193 --> 00:12:10,251
- We are here for my
early birthday dinner.

286
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:14,085
This is the only time we
all had a space to meet up

287
00:12:14,085 --> 00:12:16,508
so we did, and we're here at Mr. Bossam,

288
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:19,295
which is one of my favorite
restaurants in Koreatown.

289
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:20,397
Service is kinda eh.

290
00:12:20,397 --> 00:12:22,755
But the food is immaculate.

291
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,201
- The cheese and the pork,
oh god, I'm so excited.

292
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,504
- Delicious.

293
00:12:26,504 --> 00:12:30,004
♫ My heart belongs to you

294
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,779
♫ My heart belongs to you

295
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:41,881
♫ I'm telling you, yeah

296
00:12:41,881 --> 00:12:43,268
- [Jenn] Hi, are you full?

297
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:45,385
- Yeah, we're two very full boys.

298
00:12:45,385 --> 00:12:46,407
(laughs)

299
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:49,664
- The happy birthday with a clap.

300
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,593
One, two, three, four.

301
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:54,913
♫ Happy birthday to you

302
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:58,132

- Yeah!

307
00:13:19,979 --> 00:13:21,180
- Fetch!

308
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,013
Down.

309
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:24,721
Good.

310
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,013
(laughs)

311
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:29,506
- [Jenn] We're at Church & State.

312
00:13:29,506 --> 00:13:32,598
The (mumbles) salad has come.

313
00:13:32,598 --> 00:13:35,391
We got a side of green beans.

314
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:37,069
And there's my love.

315
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:39,326
- It's the eve before Jenn's birthday

316
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:40,945
so we're going to go for
some drinks after this

317
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,915
with some friends, then
go away for the weekend.

318
00:13:43,915 --> 00:13:45,082
So lovely day.

319
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:48,581
(calm music)

320
00:13:57,077 --> 00:13:58,682
(laughs)

321
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:02,157
♫ Happy birthday to you

322
00:14:02,157 --> 00:14:04,407
(cheering)

323
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,608
- Okay, so this present is from (mumbles).

324
00:14:10,608 --> 00:14:12,783
- Cheeki got this one for Mummy.

325
00:14:12,783 --> 00:14:14,610
- Oh, you wrapped it so well, Cheeki.

326
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,610
- Well done.

327
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:20,489
(mumbles) the tape.

328
00:14:20,489 --> 00:14:22,986
(gasps)

329
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:24,094
It's another Chippo.

330
00:14:24,094 --> 00:14:26,102
- It's another Chippo!

331
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:26,935
Oh my god!

332
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,259
She loves her.

333
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:33,127
- [Ben] Chippo, right for the neck.

334
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:34,221
Right for the neck.

335
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:35,077
(laughs)

336
00:14:35,077 --> 00:14:36,329
- Hello, everybody!

337
00:14:36,329 --> 00:14:37,162
- Hey, everybody.

338
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:38,537
- We're in the car!

339
00:14:38,537 --> 00:14:41,423
- On our way to Big Bear
for this one's birthday.

340
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:42,816
Happy birthday.

341
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,017
- Thank you.

342
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:45,725
- Oh my gosh.

343
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,376
- But yeah, we're on our
way to Big Bear right now.

344
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:50,437
I've got Grem in the back, Ben driving,

345
00:14:50,437 --> 00:14:51,770
and then Chippo!

346
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,238
I'm dropping her off at my parents' house

347
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:55,904
because they're watching
her for the weekend

348
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,833
while we're gone, and I'm so excited!

349
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,216

350
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:02,549

00:15:20,347 --> 00:15:21,764
- Happy birthday!

359
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,448
- So much food.

360
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,781
Two of these in like a week.

361
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:32,197
- Dude, In-N-Out is always a
must when you drive out of LA.

362
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,318
- Pretty much every time we leave LA.

363
00:15:34,318 --> 00:15:35,198
- Always.

364
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,115
- When you go in and out
of LA, go to In-N-Out.

365
00:15:40,015 --> 00:15:42,432
(calm music)

366
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:54,253
- Alright, we made it to the
cabin, we're in Big Bear!

367
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,102
And obviously this is even
better than the photos.

368
00:15:57,102 --> 00:16:00,041
It has such a nice rustic cabin vibe.

369
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:03,750
It's crazy that this is
only two hours away from LA.

370
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,621
It's insane.

371
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:05,965
But I'm so excited!

372
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,183
Let me show you around
before everybody gets here.

373
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:09,016
This is the kitchen area,

374
00:16:09,016 --> 00:16:11,656
lots of seating options for people.

375
00:16:11,656 --> 00:16:13,038
Let's head outside.

376
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,434
What do we got here?

377
00:16:14,434 --> 00:16:16,265
- I made it in my very first try.

378
00:16:16,265 --> 00:16:17,384
- [Jenn] Really?

379
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:19,497
- Yeah, I was like "Oh, shit!"

380
00:16:19,497 --> 00:16:20,830
Nobody saw that.

381
00:16:22,286 --> 00:16:23,119
- [Ben] Get it.

382
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,202
- [Jenn] Aww.

383
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,018
Aww.

384
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:32,099
- And then the creepy...

385
00:16:32,099 --> 00:16:32,932
- [Jenn] Oh, shed?

386
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:33,989
That's Stephanie's room.

387
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,273
(laughs) Just kidding.

388
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:36,106
What's in it?

389
00:16:36,106 --> 00:16:36,939
- I didn't even walk in.

390
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:38,596
- [Jenn] I bet it's floaties.

391
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:39,452
(growls)

392
00:16:39,452 --> 00:16:40,285
(shrieks)

393
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:41,210
- Oh god!

394
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:42,043
Oh my god.

395
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,826
- So everyone finally made it.

396
00:16:45,826 --> 00:16:47,016
- Cheers, everybody.

397
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:49,266
(cheering)

398
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:53,320
♫ Get your hands up, get your hands up

399
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,001
♫ Get your hands up

400
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:58,053
♫ Put your hands up, put your hands up

401
00:16:58,053 --> 00:17:00,303
(cheering)

402
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:03,735
(laughs)

403
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:07,613
♫ Happy birthday to you

404
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:11,196
♫ Happy birthday dear Jenn

405
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:19,021
♫ Happy birthday to you

406
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:22,137
♫ Blow it out, blow it out

407
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:24,840
♫ Blow it out, blow away

408
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,231
♫ Blow it out

409
00:17:26,232 --> 00:17:28,482
(cheering)

410
00:17:29,568 --> 00:17:31,985
(calm music)

411
00:17:44,308 --> 00:17:46,558
(cheering)

412
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,486
♫ It's your birthday, it's your birthday

413
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:54,653
♫ It's your birthday, it's your birthday

414
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,678
- We're on the Castle Rock hike right now.

415
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:17,158
It said it was intermediate to extreme

416
00:18:17,158 --> 00:18:18,732
and this is...

417
00:18:18,732 --> 00:18:20,126
- [Ben] Straight, straight uphill.

418
00:18:20,126 --> 00:18:21,121
- Yeah, straight up.

419
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:23,490
- [Ben] Nothing but up.

420
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,907
(calm music)

421
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:43,338
- Ah, the fresh air.

422
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,907
Yes.

423
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:47,228
- Feels good out here.

424
00:18:47,228 --> 00:18:48,560
Yeah, it's really nice.

425
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,955
- So we just finished our hike.

426
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:51,583
We climbed on so many rocks today.

427
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:52,416
- Yeah.

428
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,963
- Good job, good job, good job.

429
00:18:54,963 --> 00:18:56,015
Hi, everybody!

430
00:18:56,015 --> 00:18:57,308
It is Wednesday.

431
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:00,561
It has been several days since
I last picked up the camera.

432
00:19:00,561 --> 00:19:05,123
I came back from Big
Bear, I guess on Sunday,

433
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:07,864
and I had such an incredible time there.

434
00:19:07,864 --> 00:19:09,345
I didn't vlog too much.

435
00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,234
I think some people got
like bits and pieces

436
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,611
but I wasn't doing like my normal vlogging

437
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,483
because I just wanted to go
over there, unplug, unwind,

438
00:19:16,483 --> 00:19:18,917
and just be with the
closest people in my life.

439
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,513
When I came back from the mountain,

440
00:19:21,513 --> 00:19:23,466
I was just, I don't know about you guys,

441
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,688
but after like a big, big fun trip,

442
00:19:25,688 --> 00:19:28,336
when you come home you're
just kind of like (sighs).

443
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:29,886
Like you're just sad that it's all over.

444
00:19:29,886 --> 00:19:32,081
So I think I was just
kind of decompressing

445
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:35,414
and just coming to terms that it's over.

446
00:19:36,381 --> 00:19:39,783
I was looking forward to
this trip this entire month.

447
00:19:39,783 --> 00:19:42,427
But yeah, that was one of
the best birthdays of my life

448
00:19:42,427 --> 00:19:44,369
and it was nice.

449
00:19:44,369 --> 00:19:47,506
It was very intimate and it
was nice to just get away

450
00:19:47,506 --> 00:19:48,585
from the city.

451
00:19:48,585 --> 00:19:50,349
Today, Ben and I are heading to the beach.

452
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,213
I just wanted to have
like a really chill day

453
00:19:52,213 --> 00:19:55,046
because I feel like the past year,

454
00:19:56,115 --> 00:19:58,704
I have been constantly on the go.

455
00:19:58,704 --> 00:20:02,291
And so I just kind of wanted
something fun and relaxing

456
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:03,301
and serene.

457
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,324
I haven't been to an LA
beach this entire summer

458
00:20:05,324 --> 00:20:09,121
so I thought that, I don't know,
might as well squeeze it in

459
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:11,306
during this month before it gets too cold.

460
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:14,610
We are taking Cheeki and it's
gonna be really exciting.

461
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:16,370
I just cut up some Korean pears

462
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,485
and I'm just gonna get ready.

463
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,902
(calm music)

464
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:27,498
We are at the dog beach.

465
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:30,352
- Rosie's Dog Beach in Long Beach.

466
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:32,169
- [Jenn] (laughs) Rosie's
Dog Beach in Long Beach.

467
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:33,595
- It's our first time here.

468
00:20:33,595 --> 00:20:34,428
It's really nice.

469
00:20:34,428 --> 00:20:38,075
We wanted to have a nice
date day, go to the beach,

470
00:20:38,075 --> 00:20:39,907
and this is the closest one to us

471
00:20:39,907 --> 00:20:41,355
that dogs are allowed.

472
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:43,772
(calm music)

473
00:20:49,702 --> 00:20:52,535
(waves splashing)

474
00:21:09,913 --> 00:21:11,526
- Brought this book to the beach.

475
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:12,957
It's called Death Note.

476
00:21:12,957 --> 00:21:13,831
Hey, everybody.

477
00:21:13,831 --> 00:21:15,600
This is as recent as you'll see me.

478
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,764
I'm about to add this clip
in and then export the video.

479
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:21,492
So I just wanted to pop in
and thank you guys so much

480
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:22,411
for watching.

481
00:21:22,411 --> 00:21:24,985
I hope you guys have a
wonderful rest of your Sunday

482
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:27,314
and I'll see you guys
in the comments section.

483
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:28,147
Bye!

484
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:29,141
(kisses)

485
00:21:29,141 --> 00:00:00,000
(calm music)
