1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,283
- Hey everyone!

2
00:00:12,283 --> 00:00:14,204
It's your girl Jen, and for
today's face of the month

3
00:00:14,204 --> 00:00:18,039
I'm giving you this very
wearable fall autumnal look.

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:20,869
I have partnered with Clinique
again and I'm so happy

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:22,847
because they're literally
one of my favorite brands.

6
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,058
They came up with a new
foundation, which is their

7
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,077
Even Better Glow Light
Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum,

8
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:30,021
and obviously I'm wearing
this on my face today.

9
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:32,502
It gives you a nice radiant glow,

10
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,732
and I've paired it with
some nice coppery eyes.

11
00:00:34,732 --> 00:00:36,291
So if you'd like to see how I did this,

12
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,967
then let's roll to the next clip!

13
00:00:37,967 --> 00:00:40,191
So here's my face with no makeup,

14
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:41,752
and I'm just gonna start with primer.

15
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:44,132
I'm using this one from Laura Mercier.

16
00:00:44,132 --> 00:00:46,278
This is just going to
create a nice smooth base

17
00:00:46,278 --> 00:00:48,469
for the foundation we're about to put on.

18
00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:49,844
So let's move on over to the foundation.

19
00:00:49,844 --> 00:00:52,058
I'm using Clinique's Even Better Glow

20
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:54,137
Light Reflecting Makeup Broad Spectrum.

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,517
I am in the shade Meringue.

22
00:00:56,517 --> 00:00:58,961
This actually improves your
skin's radiance instantly

23
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:01,814
and over time, because it has
like luminizing properties

24
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:04,783
and vitamins C and A, so,
I'm very excited to see

25
00:01:04,783 --> 00:01:06,909
what my skin looks like
by the end of the month,

26
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:08,972
as I continue using this.

27
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,899
Gosh, it's given me like
a nice glowy look already.

28
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:13,882
I would say the coverage
is sheer to moderate.

29
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:16,795
My skin is still peeking
through, which I like,

30
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,192
because I don't want to cover anything up

31
00:01:18,192 --> 00:01:20,841
because it's just nice
when skin looks like skin.

32
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,579
So the foundation's all blended in,

33
00:01:22,579 --> 00:01:24,107
and I love the way it looks.

34
00:01:24,107 --> 00:01:26,974
This is only $28, and you
can grab it at any Clinique

35
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:30,192
counter nationwide, or just
get it online at Clinique.com.

36
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:32,890
I literally purchase everything online,

37
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:34,682
or on my phone, so if you're lazy like me,

38
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:35,792
that's always an option.

39
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,102
I want a little bit more
coverage under my eyes,

40
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:40,567
so I'm going to use this
concealer from ColourPop.

41
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,564
It is their No Filter Concealer,

42
00:01:42,564 --> 00:01:45,519
and I'm just going to pop
that right underneath my eyes

43
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,641
just to brighten up this area.

44
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:49,451
Might as well do a little bit on my nose

45
00:01:49,451 --> 00:01:51,630
and forehead and chin.

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,876
I'm going to blend this out
and answer the first question,

47
00:01:53,876 --> 00:01:55,838
this is from Sherilyn.

48
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:57,421
What are the first three things

49
00:01:57,421 --> 00:01:58,815
you think of when you wake up?

50
00:01:58,815 --> 00:02:00,692
By the way, I love you,
congrats on Eggie Shop,

51
00:02:00,692 --> 00:02:02,234
I can't wait to see what's next!

52
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:03,715
Aw, thank you!

53
00:02:03,715 --> 00:02:05,391
So the first thing I think about is,

54
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:07,101
what did I dream last night?

55
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:09,466
I've always loved to log my dreams.

56
00:02:09,466 --> 00:02:11,143
I really should journal them more,

57
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:14,827
but if a dream is really
unusual or interesting,

58
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:17,109
I'll try and like write a little

59
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:19,725
two or three sentence
synopsis on my phone.

60
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,703
Number two, I just check my Instagram.

61
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:24,366
It's just a really easy
way for me to you know,

62
00:02:24,366 --> 00:02:26,813
keep up with my friends,
see what they're up to,

63
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:28,496
and just stay connected,
and the third thing

64
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,453
is just taking Cheeki out to go pee.

65
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:33,770
She needs to go, so, I let her out.

66
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,395
So now I'm just going to set
everything with a powder.

67
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:39,035
I'm using Too Faced, Born This
Way Ethereal Setting Powder,

68
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:42,450
and honestly this is one
of the finest powders

69
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,829
I've ever used in my life.

70
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,552
I'm just going to dust some off and then,

71
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:49,173
I'm going to pack it
underneath my eyes, forehead,

72
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:52,803
smile lines, ooh. (coughs)

73
00:02:52,803 --> 00:02:54,175
I always try my best not to like

74
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,747
inhale any of it when this is out.

75
00:02:56,747 --> 00:02:58,054
So now the base is all done.

76
00:02:58,054 --> 00:02:59,424
I'm going to move on to brows.

77
00:02:59,424 --> 00:03:02,661
I'm using Diorshow's brow styler,

78
00:03:02,661 --> 00:03:04,524
and I'm just doing what I normally do.

79
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:06,301
I'm going to go in to the meat of my brows

80
00:03:06,301 --> 00:03:07,440
and just fill that in.

81
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,495
What was your favorite part

82
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:10,274
in creating your brand Eggie Shop?

83
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:11,438
By the way I love you.

84
00:03:11,438 --> 00:03:12,552
Aw, thank you!

85
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:14,723
My favorite part was
definitely seeing the samples

86
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:18,119
for the first time, and
it was just so crazy

87
00:03:18,119 --> 00:03:19,953
to see something just in theory,

88
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:22,868
into like concrete, tangible things.

89
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:24,628
As you guys know, I didn't
go to fashion school

90
00:03:24,628 --> 00:03:27,099
or design school, so it
was really important for me

91
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:29,640
to build a team around me
that knew how to do it,

92
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,570
so I worked really closely
with the design team

93
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:34,186
at Eggie, and I just
feel so lucky and blessed

94
00:03:34,186 --> 00:03:35,425
to have them on my team.

95
00:03:35,425 --> 00:03:37,189
They have been amazing to work with,

96
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:40,789
and it's just been awesome
to put whatever idea

97
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:43,559
that's in my head, into
just concrete pieces.

98
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:46,362
I love going on my Instagram
and Eggie's Instagram

99
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:48,608
and just seeing who's tagged the clothes.

100
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,986
It means so much to me that
you guys are supporting

101
00:03:50,986 --> 00:03:53,254
the brand, and I just
can't wait to show you guys

102
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:55,299
the next drop, it's going to be insane.

103
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:58,833
And now let's move on
over to the eyeshadow.

104
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:03,008
I am gonna use this huge
palette from Lorac Pro.

105
00:04:03,008 --> 00:04:06,395
It's their Mega 2 Palette, and
it's just got so many colors.

106
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:10,768
I think I'm just going to go
in with this shade over here,

107
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:12,712
called Burlap, and I'm
just going to use that

108
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:15,045
for the outer corners of my eyes.

109
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:17,403
(light jazz)

110
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,442
So now I'm going to go in with Goji,

111
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:21,264
which is kind of like a soft plum color,

112
00:04:21,265 --> 00:04:23,815
and I'm just gonna put
that in the crease again,

113
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:26,066
but closer to the eye.

114
00:04:26,066 --> 00:04:27,567
I'm just going to intensify
this a little bit more,

115
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,003
and I'm going to go in to Cabernet,

116
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:34,006
and I'm just going to start
putting on the outer corner,

117
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,923
again, like even closer to the lid.

118
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,868
I'm also going to try and
like feather a little bit

119
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:43,063
of this outward, so it just looks

120
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:45,563
like nice and soft and sultry.

121
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,989
So now I'm going to go in
with ColourPop So Quiche,

122
00:04:47,989 --> 00:04:52,983
and this is kind of like
a metallicy copper shade,

123
00:04:52,983 --> 00:04:55,295
but it has like purple reflects in it.

124
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,449
I'm not sure if they'll be shown,

125
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,587
but I'm gonna just pop it
on my lid with my finger.

126
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:01,875
Here goes nothing.

127
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:06,042
(light jazz music)
â™« Ooh

128
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:10,179
- Looks pretty good!

129
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:11,609
Now I'm going to go back into burlap,

130
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:14,611
and I'm just going to apply
this all over the underlid,

131
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,981
so it can balance the entire eye out.

132
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,769
I can't forget the inner corner highlight,

133
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,399
so I'm going to go in with seashell.

134
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,699
I'm going to pop that
in the inner corners.

135
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,965
- [Woman] Ooh!

136
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:27,590
- And all over the browbone.

137
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,998
I'm going to intensify
this a little bit more

138
00:05:28,998 --> 00:05:32,351
with Smashbox's Always
On Gel Liner in Moody,

139
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,331
and I'm gonna line the upper eyelid.

140
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:37,323
I'm trying to skip liquid
liner for this look,

141
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:39,239
so I want it to be really soft.

142
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,902
Gonna give my lashes
a nice little squeeze,

143
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:44,818
and then I'm going to use
this mascara from Innisfree,

144
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:48,985
it's their Skinny Microcara,
and look how tiny the brush is.

145
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:52,474
It's literally like a little stick,

146
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:54,540
but apparently they're
supposed to be really good

147
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,309
for tiny lashes like mine,
so we'll see how it goes.

148
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,078
Hey Jen, what has been your motivation

149
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:02,172
to continue filming slash
working through a creative block?

150
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:04,329
I'm going through one
now and I need advice.

151
00:06:04,329 --> 00:06:07,025
Honestly, I go through
creative blocks all the time,

152
00:06:07,025 --> 00:06:11,752
and the way I deal with it is
just by powering through it.

153
00:06:11,752 --> 00:06:13,960
I feel like, as an artist,
it's important for me

154
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,330
to have my practice as a daily thing,

155
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,993
and my practice is to create videos.

156
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:21,926
I was watching this interview
by this incredible artist

157
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:25,492
named James Jean, and
he is one of the most

158
00:06:25,492 --> 00:06:27,374
like prolific artists out there,

159
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,606
he has so much work, and
it's because he paints

160
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:32,589
every single day, even if
he doesn't feel like it.

161
00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:35,386
And he was explaining
how our bodies are just

162
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:37,361
mechanical vessels for our mind,

163
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:39,261
so there are going to
be times where our mind

164
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:42,378
just isn't all there, but
your body's still functioning,

165
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,266
so you might as well just carry on.

166
00:06:44,266 --> 00:06:46,212
Like I've noticed that once I'm on a roll,

167
00:06:46,212 --> 00:06:48,997
I just like to stay on that
roll as long as possible.

168
00:06:48,997 --> 00:06:51,497
For me it's all about having a streak,

169
00:06:51,497 --> 00:06:53,290
and even if I don't feel like doing it,

170
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:55,050
I just suck it up and do it.

171
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:58,099
It's impossible to feel
creative all the time,

172
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,367
but it's important to make
sure that you're prepared,

173
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,397
so when that spark of
creativity does come,

174
00:07:03,397 --> 00:07:05,443
that way you can ride the wave.

175
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:07,164
So now I'm going to just
put on some falsies.

176
00:07:07,164 --> 00:07:10,385
These are by Velour, they're
called Girl You Crazy!

177
00:07:10,385 --> 00:07:13,802
And I'm just going to pop 'em on my eyes.

178
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:18,171
So now that the falsies are on,

179
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:19,863
I'm going to move on to bronzer.

180
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:21,654
I'm using this one by It Cosmetics.

181
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:25,278
It has like a spectrum of
different products you can use.

182
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,577
You have a bronzer, a
blush, and a highlight,

183
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:29,684
but I'm just going to go
into the bronzing section,

184
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:33,131
tap some excess off, and
I'm just going to start

185
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,573
warming up my cheekbones.

186
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,875
What is the most important
relationship advice

187
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:39,553
you would give on how to keep
a strong lasting relationship?

188
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:41,382
That is a very good question.

189
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:45,088
I would say communication,
and delivery is key.

190
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:48,019
I feel like when you're open
and honest about everything,

191
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,204
then there's no room for
distortion or secrets.

192
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,087
If I ever have an issue or
if Ben every has an issue,

193
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:57,625
we talk about it, and
the way you communicate

194
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,604
is a huge thing as well.

195
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,486
Make sure that you're not
coming off like too naggy

196
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:06,912
or your tone is right, also,
make sure it's an environment

197
00:08:06,912 --> 00:08:08,654
where you guys are ready to have

198
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,151
like a long open
conversation, 'cause sometimes

199
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,034
when you don't plan or time things right,

200
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:15,491
it can just kind of blow up in your face.

201
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,660
My relationship is definitely
not perfect and it's something

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,385
that I'm working on as
well, especially the tone.

203
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,722
Sometimes when you're upset,
it's hard to control it,

204
00:08:23,722 --> 00:08:25,607
so this is advice for both of us really.

205
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:28,032
For blush I'm just going
to use the middle strip,

206
00:08:28,032 --> 00:08:30,863
going to dust that onto
the apples of my cheeks.

207
00:08:30,863 --> 00:08:33,678
- [Woman] Oh that's nice!

208
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:35,668
- For highlighter, I'm using Fenty Beauty.

209
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:38,566
I just got this, and look what I did.

210
00:08:38,566 --> 00:08:41,244
I literally dug my nail into
it as I was trying to open it

211
00:08:41,244 --> 00:08:44,082
and (sighs) I was so devastated you guys,

212
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:46,726
'cause now it just looks so morphed.

213
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,690
I'm going to put a little bit on my nose,

214
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,962
and on the cupid bow.

215
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:51,927
For the lip color, I'm just
going to go with a nude.

216
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:54,623
This is Dior's Rolling, and it's just like

217
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:57,052
a really gorgeous
moisturizing salmon shade.

218
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,753
All right guys, this is
the finished makeup look.

219
00:08:59,753 --> 00:09:02,066
I wanted something that
was still very everyday,

220
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,397
but just something that popped too.

221
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:06,711

229
00:09:20,723 --> 00:00:00,000
(light jazz)
