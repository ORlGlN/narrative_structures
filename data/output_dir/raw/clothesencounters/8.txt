1
00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:03,072
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:11,313
- Happy new year.

3
00:00:11,313 --> 00:00:12,418
- Happy new year, guys.

4
00:00:12,418 --> 00:00:13,270
- Happy 2018.

5
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:14,770
- Yeah, we did it.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:15,870
- We did it.

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,654
- Feeling a little bit delicate today.

8
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:18,487
- Oh yeah.

9
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,520
- Off to the family's place today.

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,850
Have some nice food.

11
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:24,947
We have a special guest, Angel.

12
00:00:24,947 --> 00:00:26,370
- Cheeky.

13
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,372
This is gonna be really fun.

14
00:00:27,372 --> 00:00:29,220
We play a lot of games like bingo

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,290
and yunnori (korean new years game).

16
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,140
- Yeah.

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,394
- My mom and Ben were in the champions--

18
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:34,227
- The finals.

19
00:00:34,227 --> 00:00:35,716
- Yeah, the finals.

20
00:00:35,716 --> 00:00:37,060
- I had no idea how to play the game.

21
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,520
Completely beginner's luck,

22
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,802
but I'm gonna try to do the same today

23
00:00:40,802 --> 00:00:41,804
and actually win it.

24
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:42,640
- What's your tactic this year?

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,130
- Just to try and remember how to play it

26
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,178
and then that's about it.

27
00:00:46,178 --> 00:00:47,350
- Honestly I don't know
how to play either.

28
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,340
My dad re-explains how to
play the game every year

29
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,300
and that's how it works.

30
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,280
- Yep.

31
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,860
(upbeat music)

32
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,420
- [Jennifer] So here is ddeok-kuk.

33
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,690
This is my favorite soup.

34
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:06,660
This is basically just a rice cake soup

35
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,000
with dumplings, some meat, seaweed, egg

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,100
My aunt

37
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,730
did an amazing job with the spread.

38
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,180
We've got some egg, some sausage,

39
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,230
some kimchi,  japchae.

40
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:21,452
- This is all mine.

41
00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:22,285
- [Jennifer] This is all yours.

42
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:23,130
This is your portion.

43
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:26,078
Happy new year, appa (Korean for dad).

44
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:27,079
- Happy new year.

45
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,240
(Best wishes for a Happy New Year!)

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,230
Same to you.

47
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,300
- [Jennifer] Thank you. )

48
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,920
thanks for the meal!

49
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,138
- Oh my god.

50
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:36,971
So tasty.

51
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:41,010
 

52
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,843
- So good.

53
00:01:50,074 --> 00:01:51,574
- One, two, three.

54
00:01:54,293 --> 00:01:57,130
(Best wishes for a New Year!)

55
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,050
- You guys, look at this
old photo of all of us.

56
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,220
I think this was my grandpa's birthday.

57
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,143
Grandfather looks great.

58
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:06,630
He's wearing the same hanbok (traditional Korean garments) today.

59
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:08,782
Wow.

60
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:10,399
I can't do any of these.

61
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,800
Oh, wait.

62
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,804
- Ooh.
- Oh.

63
00:02:12,804 --> 00:02:13,721
Oh my god.

64
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,975
Easy.

65
00:02:15,975 --> 00:02:17,531
- [Group] Oh.

66
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,781
(laughing)

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
(cheering)

68
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:31,339
- Oh my goodness.

69
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,907
Oh my god.

70
00:02:32,907 --> 00:02:33,824
You did it.

71
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,680
- [Jennifer] You did it, oh my god.

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,970
Yeah, you got it.

73
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:40,683
- [Dad] Oh my god.

74
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:42,347
(cheering)

75
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:45,264
- [Jennifer] Wow, this is strategy.

76
00:02:46,747 --> 00:02:48,043
Wow.

77
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,293
(cheering)

78
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,178
And of course, you can't
forget about dinner.

79
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,840
(Thanks for the meal!)

80
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,480
Thank you.

81
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,940
I (Dad) made it.

82
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,540
[Jenn] Dad, you made it?

83
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,320
Wow.

84
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,810
Chef (Dad).

85
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,147
- I (Dad) chef,

86
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:06,971
good chef, though.

87
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,803
(random Korean)

88
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,386
(upbeat music)

89
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,770
- Hello everybody.

90
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,950
It is Tuesday and I am freshly showered.

91
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,120
I feel so amazing.

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,180
This is probably one of my favorite things

93
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,080
is clean hair, clean body
after a hard workout.

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,866
The comfort and joy you seek is waiting

95
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,480
and all you need to do
is pay attention to it.

96
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:41,030
(chimes)

97
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,863
Wow.

98
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,850
- [Man] You just listened to the post

99
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,840
titled A Little Guide
For More Comfort and Joy

100
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,380
by Courtney Carver of bemarvelous.com,

101
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,640
narrated by Jenn Im.

102
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,910
(upbeat music)

103
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,541
- [Friends] Yay.

104
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,124
Happy new year, happy new year.

105
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:00,235
Yay.

106
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:01,237
- How was Redbird?

107
00:04:01,237 --> 00:04:02,480
- [Friend] It was so chill, guys.

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,490
- What kind of music did they play?

109
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,210
- [Friend] They were playing hip hop.

110
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,845
- [Jennifer] Dressy ass shoes, I know.

111
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:08,847
(laughing)

112
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:09,680
That must feel so weird

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,513
- [Amy] It is weird.

114
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,346
- [Jennifer] Have your toes out.

115
00:04:11,346 --> 00:04:12,640
- [Amy] Yeah.

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,473
- Oh my gosh.

117
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:16,910
Good morning, it is Wednesday.

118
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:19,411
Amy and I are heading into Pilates.

119
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:21,158
It's gonna be really cold in the studio

120
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,000
and it's locked.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,833
- [Amy] Go ahead.

122
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:24,666
- [Jennifer] Thanks.

123
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,550
- [Instructor] Punch punch punch punch,

124
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,459
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10.

125
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:34,959
Nine, eight, seven, six, five.

126
00:04:41,454 --> 00:04:45,730
- I would rather have this
be tighter and fitted.

127
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,260
Cheeky has a visitor.

128
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,020
They're so happy.

129
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,170
As you saw, I had the Eggie team

130
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,850
come over to my house for a fitting.

131
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,370
This is for our fourth drop

132
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,490
which is gonna happen around
music festival season,

133
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,680
so I am so excited to
show you guys the pieces.

134
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,370
A lot of the stuff needs some work,

135
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,640
so I can't for everything to be perfect.

136
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,100
I didn't get the vlog Angela and Leona

137
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,560
but I work with them all the time,

138
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,070
Angela especially, so...

139
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,910
Leona is the lovely lady at Eggie

140
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,420
who makes sure all the
measurements are correct

141
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,190
and she sends it over to the manufacturers

142
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,740
so that they can produce a
correct fitting prototype,

143
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,730
and then we have Angela, of course,

144
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:32,140
and she is my right hand woman.

145
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,080
She helps me design everything for Eggie,

146
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,790
and I freaking love her.

147
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,860
She just gets me.

148
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,230
As you guys know, I didn't
go to fashion school

149
00:05:40,238 --> 00:05:41,071
or I don't know how to sew or anything,

150
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,080
so we work really closely together

151
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,910
to create these designs for you guys.

152
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,450
I'm heading out to Thailand tomorrow,

153
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,750
so I'm gonna start packing.

154
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,890
I don't have anything done,

155
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,950
and then I'm gonna have
dinner with my friend Crystal

156
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,980
and then we're gonna watch
our friend Kelly perform

157
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,750
so quite a jam packed night.

158
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,710
I'm gonna get some water.

159
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,694
But first, I'm gonna pack.

160
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:02,277
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,110
Hello everybody, happy Monday.

162
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,410
I am back in LA and it feels so amazing.

163
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:24,200
I just got back from Thailand

164
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,800
and I was gone for nine days,

165
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,430
so it feels just, I don't know.

166
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,780
I love traveling and I love being out

167
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,494
but nothing feels as good as coming home.

168
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:40,280
Right now I am on my way to the dentist.

169
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,860
I'm gonna get my teeth cleaned.

170
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,730
It has officially been six months

171
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,830
since my last teeth cleaning so going back

172
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:49,320
and hopefully there's nothing wrong.

173
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,490
Last time I got x-rays and
I didn't have any cavities,

174
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:54,950
so the Sonicare is really
working out for me.

175
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,040
If you guys don't have an
electric toothbrush by now,

176
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,420
I highly recommend it.

177
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,990
I haven't had a cavity since that.

178
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,870
Before, every time, I would
always go in to the dentist

179
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,360
with at least something
that they had to fix,

180
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,010
so yeah, after lunch.

181
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,650
My mom is coming over with me.

182
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,690
She volunteered to clean my house,

183
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,134
and I'm gonna help her, obviously.

184
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:16,610
I don't know if this is
just an Asian parent thing,

185
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,980
but every time my parents come over,

186
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,960
they are dying to vacuum, mop the floors,

187
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,220
and all that stuff and it's
one of the perks, you know?

188
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,230
Let me know in the comments down below

189
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,950
if that's what your parents
do when they come visit you?

190
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,250
But yeah, she has the day off.

191
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,900
Today is Martin Luther King day,

192
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,220
and I'm so happy it's being recognized.

193
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,320
Martin Luther King did
so much for America,

194
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,620
especially for freedom.

195
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,700
He really paved the
way for all minorities,

196
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,040
and if he didn't speak up or if he didn't

197
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,550
have that dream and he didn't speak up,

198
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,878
then we definitely would not
be here where we are now.

199
00:07:46,878 --> 00:07:49,795
(crowd chattering)

200
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,822
Hi, Emma.

201
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:56,340
Hi, Belle.

202
00:07:57,358 --> 00:07:58,275
I know, hi.

203
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,390
Having lunch with
eomma (mom)

204
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,600
and imo! (aunt)

205
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,320
All right, so we just got back from lunch.

206
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,085
My mom is over, helping
me clean the entire house.

207
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:16,210
What did I do to deserve
such an amazing mom?

208
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:18,637
Right now, Sam and Ben
are at a cafe working.

209
00:08:18,637 --> 00:08:22,290
Ben is currently working on
my Jenn goes to Phuket vlog

210
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,908
and I'm so grateful because that day

211
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:27,230
or that trip was a lot of footage,

212
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,740
so there's a lot to get started on that,

213
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,010
and I wanna have that
done as soon as possible.

214
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,110
So yeah, while he's working on that,

215
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,830
I'm gonna work on the house.

216
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,809
I normally don't like
to call out the state

217
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:38,459
of my office, but I
wanted to show you guys

218
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,620
the before so...

219
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,039
Here it is.

220
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,765
It has not been this
messy in such a long time.

221
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,730
But yeah, my luggage is still here.

222
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,920
I gotta put everything away.

223
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,030
I gotta open some packages,

224
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,560
clean this desk up,

225
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,393
and right now I'm waiting

226
00:08:53,393 --> 00:08:55,290
for my vacuum to finish recharging,

227
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,720
but yeah, cleaning day!

228
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,920
So the first rule that my
mom has when she's cleaning

229
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,600
the house is that she likes
to open all the windows

230
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,340
to get a good circulation in the house,

231
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,090
so that is what I'm gonna do first.

232
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,840
So I like to just take out all the stuff

233
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,420
out of my luggage first and
then put my luggage away,

234
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,890
so that way I have no
choice but to clean up

235
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,870
everything on my floor

236
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,620
or else it'll bother me like crazy.

237
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,410
So now I like to put everything
in their little piles,

238
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,040
so right now I've got products.

239
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,680
We've got dirty clothes.

240
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,540
I don't know why I put this
right in front of you guys.

241
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,780
I got shoes.

242
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,040
Clothes I wanna hang.

243
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,890
Bathing suits

244
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,010
and it just helps me keep organized

245
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,150
when I put everything away,

246
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:48,370
'cause then I'll know
exactly where everything is.

247
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:59,010
(speaking foreign language)

248
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,760
(vacuum running)

249
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:12,230
I love this salad.

250
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,770
Hello.

251
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,340
It is the next day.

252
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,790
My office and the entire
house are completely clean.

253
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,560
I wanted to show you guys the space.

254
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,420
Look at all this floor.

255
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,130
I love it.

256
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,320
Oh yeah.

257
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,460
I just feel so much more amazing

258
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,970
when my place is clean

259
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,010
because when my place is clean,

260
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:39,384
my mind is clean.

261
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,840
Who would have thought?

262
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,870
But anyway, last night was so much fun.

263
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,440
It was some good family bonding time.

264
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,080
We had dinner at Fig At 7th,

265
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,860
which is one of my
favorite shopping places

266
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,950
in downtown LA.

267
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,465
They've got an H&M, a Zara.

268
00:10:52,465 --> 00:10:56,220
They got a Bath and Body
Works, Victoria Secret, Target,

269
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,800
but anyway, needless to
say, I went shopping.

270
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,450
I got my mom a couple sweaters,

271
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,620
and I got myself a couple of things,

272
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,730
because it's been a minute

273
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,550
since I feel like I've shopped, but...

274
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,440
They had this crazy sale everywhere,

275
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,780
so first up at Nordstrom Rack,

276
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,680
I got this black back pack.

277
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,750
It is by Madden Girl,

278
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,820
so I guess Steve Madden makes accessories.

279
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:22,520
It looks like that other
brand that has this logo,

280
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,010
but either way, I love it.

281
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,160
It fits my Canon T3I, which is pretty much

282
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,180
the only reason why I got this backpack.

283
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,710
All my backpacks are breaking

284
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,320
because my vlogging camera
is an unnecessary weight.

285
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,740
It's around seven pounds.

286
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,540
I don't know why I am so loyal to things,

287
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,010
but anyway, I got a new backpack

288
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,660
because my velvet one broke,

289
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,530
so this is the new backpack for now.

290
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,290
I like that it's in this ski pants,

291
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,957
or snow material,

292
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,930
because when it rains or something

293
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,630
or if I'm in a different
climate or something,

294
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,150
it's gonna protect all the goodies inside,

295
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,920
and this was $30.

296
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,600
All right, next up, we have Zara.

297
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,650
They're having an insane
sale on everything,

298
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,540
and the only thing I got were shoes.

299
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,140
So the first pair of shoes I
got were these pointed mules.

300
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,810
They've got a ruched center

301
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:18,830
and I just feel like
they look very elegant,

302
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:21,010
and then I got another pointed mule.

303
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,350
I guess these aren't really mules.

304
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,420
They're pointed slip ons,

305
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,550
and the last pair of shoes
I got were these mules,

306
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,860
another pair of mules, jeez.

307
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:34,080
But these have a nice
teddy material in the front

308
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,760
and these are very, very comfortable.

309
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,346
All these pairs of shoes were 20 bucks,

310
00:12:38,346 --> 00:12:41,980
so I got everything for 60 bucks,

311
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:42,813
which is insane.

312
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,000
That's like the cost of one shoe at Zara,

313
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,710
and then at H&M I got these two beanies.

314
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,190
This one was 13 bucks

315
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:52,610
and then, this one, I don't
know how much this one was,

316
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,140
but probably less than that,

317
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,980
because this is just a
plain, black ribbed beanie,

318
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,160
a little slouchy,

319
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,010
and then, this one has a
cute little pom pom on it.

320
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,930
Since I'm already showing
you guys all these things,

321
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,580
I thought I would throw in
Stephanie's Christmas present.

322
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,470
She made us coasters of all the girls,

323
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,380
and they are so cute.

324
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,550
She got my hair color so perfectly.

325
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,830
It really looked like this at the time.

326
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,280
The whole squad protecting
the surfaces of my home now,

327
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,070
and the last thing I
wanted to show you guys

328
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,270
was some jewelry by a subscriber.

329
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,710
Her name is Eugenia.

330
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,950
She is from Toronto

331
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,910
and she just sent me the
most beautiful pieces,

332
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,810
so I had to shout her out.

333
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,810
First up we have these really
beautiful drop down earrings.

334
00:13:36,212 --> 00:13:38,310
They're very statement,

335
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,150
and then she has these abstract
squiggle statement earrings.

336
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,760
The third is a modern
day contemporary hoop,

337
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,950
and the last pair of earrings,

338
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,240
and the ones that I'm
the most excited about

339
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,440
are these adorable egg earring.

340
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,320
I love the fact that
she made the yolk gold

341
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,010
and the rest is this beautiful chrome.

342
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,240
I love these earrings.

343
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,210
Thank you so much for
sending these to me, Eugenia.

344
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,880
You're so talented.

345
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,470
I'll leave her info in the description box

346
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,880
so please check her out.

347
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,130
But yeah, that is the end of the haul.

348
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm gonna get started with my day.

349
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I already went to Pilates earlier,

350
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,120
but this class was just
weak for some reason.

351
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,400
I feel like I didn't really get

352
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,500
that full of a workout.

353
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,290
I feel like Pilates is 50 50.

354
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:24,820
Some classes I'm in excruciating pain

355
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,649
and I'm so sore, but other classes,

356
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:27,657
I'm just kind of like...

357
00:14:27,657 --> 00:14:32,138
Like I'm not even breaking a sweat.

358
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,888
(relaxing music)

359
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:46,969
Hello everybody.

360
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,490
- Hello, everybody.

361
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,266
- It's Ben Jenn here.

362
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:51,802
- That's me, there we go.

363
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:55,434
- We are going to the Goodwill outlet.

364
00:14:55,434 --> 00:14:57,240
We're gonna film a video.

365
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,578
Ben is gonna help me shoot
it as he always does.

366
00:14:59,578 --> 00:15:01,700
- Give my best shot.

367
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,642
- Honestly, it's been a long
time since I've been here.

368
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:06,170
Instead of going to the
normal Goodwill store,

369
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,120
I'm gonna go to the outlet,

370
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,250
so I've actually never stepped in there

371
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,950
because even that's really
overwhelming for me,

372
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:17,370
'cause everything is just
in a big giant bucket.

373
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,830
Yeah, yeah.

374
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,663
- Everything's like a dollar.

375
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:21,100
- That's what they say.

376
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,310
I hear that.

377
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,250
You just pick whatever you wanna buy

378
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,580
and then they weigh it

379
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,260
and then, that's how you pay.

380
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,130
I've never seen this Goodwill so full.

381
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,906
The parking lot is rammed.

382
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,106
- [Ben] Everyone's got
the same idea as us.

383
00:15:34,106 --> 00:15:34,939
- [Jennifer] I know.

384
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:35,772
- [Ben] They're all
doing the thrift videos.

385
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:37,300
- [Jennifer] I see you.

386
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,260
You're not gonna get my goodies.

387
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,093
- [Ben] There's no spaces.

388
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,660
- [Jennifer] There's no spaces.

389
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,150
Holy cow.

390
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,310
- [Ben] It's a fucking Wednesday at 11 AM.

391
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,170
- [Jennifer] Oh my gosh, I know.

392
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,620
Oh my goodness.

393
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,310
Let's just go all the way to the back.

394
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,370
- Did it, guys.
- Nice.

395
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,060
Oh, whoa, whoa.

396
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,346
Oh, Ben loves to reverse back.

397
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:55,610
- You know, it gets us,

398
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,640
it means when we leave, we're fine.

399
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,910
People in America don't
like to reverse park.

400
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,363
- Yeah, 'cause you're
just a really good parker.

401
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,030
(vocalizing)

402
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,863
We made it.

403
00:16:05,863 --> 00:16:07,760
Here we are at the Goodwill outlet store.

404
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,300
We've been to just the
normal Goodwill store

405
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,333
a lot of times but it's
my first time entering

406
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,500
this part of town.

407
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,940
I guess this part of the store.

408
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,523
(upbeat music)

409
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,857
I need to burn my hands, excuse me.

410
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,440
(upbeat music)

411
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,260
Hello, so I'm back from the outlet store.

412
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,610
I washed my hands with soap obviously,

413
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,200
but yeah, I got some great things.

414
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,870
The outlet was, I'm not gonna lie,

415
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,080
it was really intense
and you're just sifting

416
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,470
through a lot of stuff.

417
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,820
Also, the people there
are very territorial

418
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,360
because they are some people that go there

419
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,530
to buy the clothes and
then try and upsell it

420
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,670
on eBay or at the flea markets.

421
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:04,619
When those buckets come out,

422
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,119
a fresh bucket comes out,

423
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,889
literally it's like piranhas

424
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,069
eating this big dead carcass,

425
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,589
but basically I'm home now,

426
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,199
and I'm gonna cook some lunch.

427
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,758
Ben and Sam are at a cafe working again,

428
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,670
and I'm gonna make some
Dengjang Chigae

429
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,270
So this is essentially
like a Korean miso soup.

430
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,510
It's fermented bean paste.

431
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,109
I know that sounds disgusting

432
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:29,020
but it is so delicious.

433
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,540
All right, so now that
everything is cooking,

434
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,610
I am going to put in some
Doenjang

435
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,100
This is the magic sauce.

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,450
Like that amount.

437
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,090
Maybe this is too much.

438
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,599
I don't care.

439
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:53,182
(upbeat music)

440
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,551
All right guys, that
is a wrap on the vlog.

441
00:17:58,551 --> 00:18:01,240
I actually finished inputting
the rest of the clips

442
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,080
into my laptop so this
is very, very recent.

443
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,060
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day

444
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,002
just editing this vlog and
it will be out on Sunday,

445
00:18:09,002 --> 00:18:11,360
which is when you're watching this,

446
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,290
so yes, I hope you guys
enjoyed this little

447
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,380
catch up vlog.

448
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,500
I feel like, I don't know.

449
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,740
I feel like this month
has gone so quickly,

450
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,740
but yeah, I am going to continue to vlog

451
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,007
the rest of January and then

452
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:26,087
I don't know where I'm going with this.

453
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:28,610
I just came here to say goodbye.

454
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:29,850
Thank you so much for watching

455
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,223
and see you guys in the next one.

456
00:18:31,223 --> 00:18:32,056
Bye.

457
00:18:32,999 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
