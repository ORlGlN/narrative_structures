1
00:00:02,463 --> 00:00:04,880
(jazz music)

2
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:06,872
- Hey everyone.

3
00:00:06,872 --> 00:00:07,911
It's your girl Jenn

4
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:09,361
and today I am talking about

5
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:12,225
10 of my favorite movies of all time.

6
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:15,105
Obviously, you don't need to
watch these before you die.

7
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:16,871
I just thought it would tie in really well

8
00:00:16,871 --> 00:00:18,329
with my favorite books video.

9
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,084
After I uploaded that, a lot of you guys

10
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:24,230
were requesting a movie version,
so here I am, filling that.

11
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,397
It was freaking hard to narrow
it down to 10, but I did.

12
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:31,286
These are all movies
that have changed my life

13
00:00:31,286 --> 00:00:33,689
or I just thoroughly enjoyed.

14
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,110
So let's get started with he countdown.

15
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,264
At the top of the list

16
00:00:37,264 --> 00:00:40,021
I have Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind.

17
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:42,715
This has been my favorite
movie, since I was 15

18
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,778
and it's always such a pain to say it,

19
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:46,289
because the title's so long,

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:47,830
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,

21
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,469
but it is still my favorite film today.

22
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:53,203
I've seen it a million times
and I never get sick of it,

23
00:00:53,203 --> 00:00:56,590
because this love story
is so freakin' real.

24
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,552
It's about a couple
named Joel and Clementine

25
00:00:59,552 --> 00:01:02,256
and one day Joel wakes up and he realizes

26
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:04,205
that Clementine has completely erased him

27
00:01:04,205 --> 00:01:06,627
and the relationship from her mind

28
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:08,826
and obviously, he's
really confused and hurt

29
00:01:08,826 --> 00:01:11,342
and so he decides to get
that same procedure done

30
00:01:11,342 --> 00:01:13,345
and erase her from his memories.

31
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,856
And so you see the whole process

32
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:16,754
of them removing the memories.

33
00:01:16,754 --> 00:01:18,269
At the beginning of the film

34
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,045
you don't really know
their relationship at all,

35
00:01:20,045 --> 00:01:22,287
but as they're removing each memory,

36
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,810
one by one, you see how they fell in love

37
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,645
and how they fell apart.

38
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,609
During heartbreak,
sometimes you're tempted

39
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:31,117
to think, you know, I wish I could just

40
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,845
erase this freakin' person from my mind,

41
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:35,688
but you see, in the film, that sometimes

42
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:37,453
it doesn't really work that way.

43
00:01:37,453 --> 00:01:38,868
And maybe sometimes it's better

44
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:40,247
that you have those memories,

45
00:01:40,247 --> 00:01:41,415
because you could learn from them.

46
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:42,680
But yeah, it is my favorite film,

47
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,175
very thought provoking, super surreal.

48
00:01:45,175 --> 00:01:46,882
I love the visuals of the film

49
00:01:46,882 --> 00:01:49,529
and it's at the top of my list.

50
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:52,298
Coming in at number two
I have the film Rushmore.

51
00:01:52,298 --> 00:01:55,162
I have always been a huge
fan of Wes Anderson films,

52
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,783
but this is my favorite one by far.

53
00:01:57,783 --> 00:02:00,518
Part of the reason why I love it

54
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:02,773
is because it's set in a
private school setting.

55
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:04,384
I've always enjoyed that setting,

56
00:02:04,384 --> 00:02:05,781
because maybe when I was younger

57
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:07,222
I always wanted to go to private school.

58
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:10,380
It's about a gifted
student named Max Fischer

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,035
and he is very, very
involved in the school.

60
00:02:13,035 --> 00:02:14,702
He's the president of all the clubs,

61
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:17,114
like in a million
extracurricular activities,

62
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:19,745
but unfortunately his
grades don't reflect that,

63
00:02:19,745 --> 00:02:21,925
because he's too busy
exhausting his energy

64
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,884
on everything else.

65
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:25,820
But basically he needs
to get his act together.

66
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,653
But he ends up falling in
love with a teacher at school

67
00:02:28,653 --> 00:02:32,306
and wooing here becomes
his main objective.

68
00:02:32,306 --> 00:02:34,927
And I love Max Fischer,
because he is a character

69
00:02:34,927 --> 00:02:36,773
that really gets whatever he wants,

70
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,333
or almost whatever he wants,
because he's so confident

71
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:42,890
and he's just like a bullshit talker.

72
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,691
He's just this je ne sais quo to him

73
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:49,120
and I love the dynamic
between all the characters.

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,123
It's just like a bizarre love triangle.

75
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:52,416
You'll see.

76
00:02:52,416 --> 00:02:55,385
Next up, I have a very
enlightening movie for you.

77
00:02:55,385 --> 00:02:57,793
It is called Fantastic Planet.

78
00:02:57,793 --> 00:02:59,225
I first saw this in college

79
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:01,327
and it's one of those movies
where after you watch it

80
00:03:01,327 --> 00:03:04,203
you're like, whoa life
man, because it really

81
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,551
shakes up your perspective of the world.

82
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:11,480
It's about a planet where big,
giant aliens are the rulers

83
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,948
and they take humans captive

84
00:03:13,948 --> 00:03:17,604
and humans are just like little pets.

85
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:18,762
They're domesticated.

86
00:03:18,762 --> 00:03:21,894
They're just for the
amusement of the aliens

87
00:03:21,894 --> 00:03:24,698
and one day one of the
little humans runs away

88
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,061
and he discovers a world

89
00:03:26,061 --> 00:03:28,808
where there's like other
humans living a civilization.

90
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,493
It's just a really trippy film

91
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:32,543
and I just love the animation.

92
00:03:32,543 --> 00:03:36,248
It's very old school sci-fi cartoons.

93
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:37,942
It was made in the 70s and oh,

94
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,683
it's also completely in French,

95
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:42,039
so I highly recommend you
watch the French version

96
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,308
with English subtitles,
because the dubbed English

97
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,924
just sounds bizarre.

98
00:03:46,924 --> 00:03:48,854
It's just a preference thing.

99
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,810
I believe you can watch it on YouTube.

100
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,032
You can rent it.

101
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,650
I'll leave a link down
below, if I can find it.

102
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,982
So go check it out.

103
00:03:54,982 --> 00:03:57,029
Moving on, I have The Holy Mountain.

104
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:59,018
This is probably one
of the most fucked up,

105
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:01,395
but visually entrancing films

106
00:04:01,395 --> 00:04:03,395
I've ever seen in my entire life.

107
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,455
Some parts were kind of hard to see,

108
00:04:05,455 --> 00:04:07,926
because they're very graphic, gory,

109
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:10,390
a lot of nudity, but I just

110
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,839
couldn't take my eyes off the screen.

111
00:04:11,839 --> 00:04:13,026
It's insane.

112
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:16,101
It was kind of like watching
this really crazy dream unfold

113
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:20,268
and I love that if you pause
at any moment of the film

114
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,948
it's something beautiful or very intense.

115
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,283
It makes you feel some type of way

116
00:04:26,283 --> 00:04:27,836
and I feel like that's what art is about.

117
00:04:27,836 --> 00:04:30,600
It's supposed to evoke
a feeling out of you,

118
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,635
whether it's joy or whether
it makes you uncomfortable.

119
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:35,015
This is one of my favorite films

120
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:37,545
to discuss with other
people, because I love

121
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:39,778
hearing their interpretations of it.

122
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,762
It's coded with symbolism.

123
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:44,724
For me, I thought that this film was about

124
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:48,398
realizing that the world is
just a projection of images

125
00:04:48,398 --> 00:04:50,545
and you are the director
behind the screen.

126
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:52,656
This film is a psychedelic masterpiece

127
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:54,471
and I highly recommend you watch it.

128
00:04:54,471 --> 00:04:56,025
Not for the faint of heart though.

129
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:59,052
If you are looking for like
a happy, easygoing film

130
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:01,812
probably wouldn't watch it.

131
00:05:01,812 --> 00:05:03,010
Coming in at number five,

132
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,245
I have The Shining by Stanley Kubrick.

133
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:08,112
I normally am not a huge
fan of horror films,

134
00:05:08,112 --> 00:05:11,164
but this movie is just a
complete exception for me.

135
00:05:11,164 --> 00:05:13,054
It is about a tortured writer

136
00:05:13,054 --> 00:05:16,221
who decides to caretake this big hotel

137
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:20,124
that is very, very isolated
and he takes his wife

138
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:21,848
and his son there and his son

139
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:25,279
starts to see weird things at the hotel.

140
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,504
He starts to see previous
guests that stayed there

141
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:30,853
and just really freaky stuff
that happened in the past.

142
00:05:30,853 --> 00:05:33,532
Jack Nicholson's
performance is outstanding.

143
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:36,004
He plays a crazy guy so well.

144
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:37,004
It's insane.

145
00:05:38,062 --> 00:05:40,421
There are iconic scenes in that film

146
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:42,955
that will never be taken out of my brain.

147
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:46,390
For example, I love the
Grady twins in the hallway

148
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,167
and the woman in the tub.

149
00:05:48,167 --> 00:05:49,611
That was freaking freaky.

150
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:53,487
I think it's a really awesome
time to watch it as well,

151
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:56,118
because it's like Halloween.

152
00:05:56,118 --> 00:05:58,642
It's a little spooky, so go check it out.

153
00:05:58,642 --> 00:06:00,939
My next film favorite is Donnie Darko.

154
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,202
This will always have such
a soft spot in my heart,

155
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:04,725
because it pretty much encapsulates

156
00:06:04,725 --> 00:06:08,099
how I felt during my teenage angsty years.

157
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:11,571
It's about a troubled
boy named Donnie Darko.

158
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,193
He's played by Jake Gyllenhaal.

159
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:14,994
He was so moody and so fine,

160
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:17,926
but he survives this freak accident

161
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,638
and since then he starts
seeing weird visions,

162
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:24,060
particularly this man in
a bunny suit named Frank.

163
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,339
And Frank is the one
that kinda persuades him

164
00:06:27,339 --> 00:06:29,442
to do all this gnarly stuff.

165
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,933
It's very thought provoking, open ended

166
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,842
and I feel like it could be a hit or miss

167
00:06:34,842 --> 00:06:36,383
with a lot of people, because some people

168
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:38,177
might watch it and be like,
"What was the point of that",

169
00:06:38,177 --> 00:06:39,579
and other people would be like,

170
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:41,162
"Didn't you see, the
point is right there".

171
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:43,144
I think this is one of
the first films I saw

172
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:46,518
that just got me hooked
into the sci-fi genre.

173
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:48,804
Next up I have The Matrix.

174
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:50,994
I would say this is probably the only film

175
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:52,583
you should watch before you die,

176
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:55,004
because if you haven't you
are severely missing out.

177
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:58,272
I first saw this film
when I was in fifth grade.

178
00:06:58,272 --> 00:07:00,553
I had no idea what I
was getting myself into.

179
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,724
My brother put it on the TV
and I was just like watching

180
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,286
and slowly my mind started to enlighten

181
00:07:07,286 --> 00:07:09,637
and absorb what was actually
happening on the screen.

182
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,814
The matrix is about a man

183
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:13,931
who's just living his ordinary life

184
00:07:13,931 --> 00:07:15,749
and one day he is
presented with a question

185
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:18,449
whether he wants to live
and continue his normal life

186
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:20,438
or find out the truth

187
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,075
and obviously he picks the truth

188
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,043
and it just unravels the fact

189
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:27,335
that the world is just
a simulation of images.

190
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:28,967
I believe it's a depiction of

191
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:30,941
Plato's The Allegory of the Cave

192
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:33,796
and it does such a cool
job explaining that.

193
00:07:33,796 --> 00:07:37,074
It's honestly the movie
that got me into sci-fi.

194
00:07:37,074 --> 00:07:38,189
I thought it was Donnie Darko,

195
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:40,126
but The Matrix was actually the movie

196
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,211
that just like broadened my horizons

197
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,117
and made me think of
things in a different way.

198
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:47,340
Next up I have a
lighthearted film for you.

199
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,399
It' is called Wayne's World.

200
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:51,147
I grew up listening to rock music

201
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,501
and Wayne's World was a film

202
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,607
that really incorporated
the rock and roll lifestyle

203
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,106
with comedy.

204
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:58,524
And it's about two dudes
that love rock music

205
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:03,137
and they have a TV show where
it's on public access network,

206
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,941
but basically that show
starts to get some traction

207
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,600
and you get to just follow their story.

208
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,313
And it's one of those really lighthearted,

209
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:14,196
goofy, silly movies that doesn't
take itself too seriously.

210
00:08:14,196 --> 00:08:16,042
This movie is the reason why I know

211
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:18,249
the entire lyrics for Bohemian Rhapsody.

212
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,948
That scene is just iconic

213
00:08:20,948 --> 00:08:23,739
and it's probably the first of it's kind

214
00:08:23,739 --> 00:08:25,197
for carpool karaoke.

215
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,531
So go check it out, if
you want a good laugh.

216
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,268
Now I'm gonna bring the mood back down.

217
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:31,419
My next film is Mysterious Skin.

218
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,278
This is a very disturbing
yet touching film.

219
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,173
It follows the story of two boys

220
00:08:36,173 --> 00:08:38,140
that have undergone something

221
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,600
very, very traumatic in their childhood.

222
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:44,482
And you just see how they
both cope with the abuse.

223
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:48,760
One of them is just obsessed
with space and aliens

224
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,757
and abductions and the other
becomes a male prostitute.

225
00:08:52,757 --> 00:08:56,840
So it's a very sad story,
but it's very engaging.

226
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:02,605
It is like a very interesting
coming of age story.

227
00:09:02,605 --> 00:09:04,272
I don't know.

228
00:09:04,272 --> 00:09:05,400
I feel like some people might find it

229
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,511
really difficult to
watch, so maybe check out

230
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:09,680
the subject matter before you watch it.

231
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,735
My last film is Ex Machina.

232
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:13,925
I wanted to pick something
that was a little more current,

233
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:16,551
because a lot of my picks are throwbacks.

234
00:09:16,551 --> 00:09:18,753
But this was released in 2015

235
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:21,384
and I actually saw this in
theaters, which was insane.

236
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:23,908
My jaw was dropped the entire time.

237
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:25,889
I couldn't believe my eyes, honestly.

238
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,388
It was a really haunting cool storyline,

239
00:09:28,388 --> 00:09:30,665
very visually pleasing.

240
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,730
It's about a programmer
who is interacting with

241
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,005
artificial intelligence
and it's in the form

242
00:09:35,005 --> 00:09:37,401
of this gorgeous robot lady.

243
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:41,858
Her face is just like a woman,
but her body is a robot.

244
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:43,436
And the programmer needs to decide

245
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:46,685
whether this AI is conscious or not.

246
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:49,020
And it just raised a lot
of questions in my head.

247
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,487
After I saw it, I was like

248
00:09:50,487 --> 00:09:52,812
I just kept on thinking about it for days.

249
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:55,004
It's one of those films
that just like kind of

250
00:09:55,004 --> 00:09:57,806
eat away at you, but I would recommend it.

251
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:01,205
I have always found AI so fascinating,

252
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,155
so this checks all my boxes.

253
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:04,669
All right guys, those are my

254
00:10:04,669 --> 00:10:06,409
top ten favorite films of all time.

255
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,856
As you can tell, I am a huge sucker

256
00:10:08,856 --> 00:10:11,403
for psychological sci-fic thrillers.

257
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:14,145
I just really enjoy watching things

258
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:16,965
that make me question my life

259
00:10:16,965 --> 00:10:18,334
and just like blow my mind.

260
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,998
I do like watching
lighthearted stuff as well,

261
00:10:20,998 --> 00:10:23,402
but it just didn't make
my top ten, you know.

262
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:24,573
It would mean a lot to me if

263
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:25,696
you wrote down your favorite film

264
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:27,067
in the comments down below.

265
00:10:27,067 --> 00:10:28,665
I'd love to hear your guys' suggestions.

266
00:10:28,665 --> 00:10:30,654
Also I wanted to apologize for the light,

267
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:33,258
because I decided to
film this at like 5:30

268
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:35,993
and now the sun's setting and my mic died

269
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,808
and that just set me back.

270
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:39,910
Yeah, it's been a
struggle filming this one,

271
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,531
but I'm glad I did.

272
00:10:41,531 --> 00:10:43,067
Thank you so much for watching

273
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,796
and I'll see you guys in the next one.

274
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:45,629
Bye.

275
00:10:46,526 --> 00:00:00,000
(kiss)
