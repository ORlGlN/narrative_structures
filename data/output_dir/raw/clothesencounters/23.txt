1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,680
(slow instrumental music)

2
00:00:06,384 --> 00:00:08,101
- Hey everyone, it's your girl Jenn.

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:10,414
And today I am filming my fall haul.

4
00:00:10,414 --> 00:00:12,948
Bu this isn't just your
normal, average haul

5
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:14,694
because I'll be talking about

6
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:17,685
all the new items from
Eggie drop number two.

7
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,210
For those who are just tuning in,

8
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:20,704
Eggie is my clothing line,

9
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:23,506
and I've put my blood
sweat and tears into this

10
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:25,509
and I'm so proud of this collection.

11
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:27,460
This season is inspired by my past,

12
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:30,549
specifically high school
and like early college.

13
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,225
So that's why there is a variety of

14
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:34,221
hoodies, long sleeves, tanks

15
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:37,180
and also just modern
trends that I love today.

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,497
Just a nice mix-match of everything.

17
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,522
I've already uploaded the video look book

18
00:00:41,522 --> 00:00:43,549
so please hit the cards or the down bar.

19
00:00:43,549 --> 00:00:45,666
But I honestly just wanted to sit down

20
00:00:45,666 --> 00:00:47,972
and talk about each item piece-by-piece

21
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:49,523
in a good old-fashioned haul.

22
00:00:49,523 --> 00:00:50,881
So let's get started.

23
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,302
I wanna chat about outerwear first,

24
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,075
so here is the Tardy Bomber.

25
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,326
This is the perfect fitted bomber

26
00:00:56,326 --> 00:00:58,312
that everybody needs in their wardrobe.

27
00:00:58,312 --> 00:01:00,651
I put it in this really flashy red

28
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:02,542
because I feel like red
is a statement color

29
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:03,650
that's here to stay.

30
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,054
You can obviously wear it
just zipped up normally,

31
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:07,455
or you can just simply

32
00:01:07,455 --> 00:01:09,946
snap the top button and
leave the rest open.

33
00:01:09,946 --> 00:01:12,280
I feel like that's just a
really chic way to style it.

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,281
In the last collection we had
a really oversized bomber,

35
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,664
but I thought for this
season I'd dial it back,

36
00:01:17,664 --> 00:01:20,218
create something that is
slightly cropped, more snug,

37
00:01:20,218 --> 00:01:22,566
and perfect for the chilly weather.

38
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:24,116
Next up I have the Tardy Hoodie.

39
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:26,512
This is a really cute oversized hoodie

40
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:28,809
with this amazing chain detail.

41
00:01:28,809 --> 00:01:31,373
At first we were just gonna
have normal drawstrings,

42
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:33,169
but I thought we would
just amp it up a notch

43
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:34,767
and add this chain detail.

44
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:36,465
I made sure that you could remove it,

45
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:39,218
so that way when you wash
it it doesn't get all rusty.

46
00:01:39,218 --> 00:01:40,968
So you can wear the chain in two ways.

47
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,509
You can either just wear it like this,

48
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:45,508
or you can loop the chains together

49
00:01:45,508 --> 00:01:47,657
and create kind of like a necklace effect.

50
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,512
I feel like with this hoodie
you don't need to accessorize

51
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:51,634
because the chain does all the talking.

52
00:01:51,634 --> 00:01:53,942
It also has these massive balloon sleeves

53
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:54,892
that are very long.

54
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:57,253
But there is like a cuff detail,

55
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:58,694
so if they're just too long

56
00:01:58,694 --> 00:01:59,846
and you wanna be able to function,

57
00:01:59,846 --> 00:02:02,568
you can just push it
up and be on your way.

58
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:04,312
So I have another
comfortable hoodie for you.

59
00:02:04,312 --> 00:02:06,728
This is called the Left and Right Hoodie,

60
00:02:06,728 --> 00:02:07,639
and I named it that

61
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:10,690
because it has left and right
in Korean on the pockets.

62
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,497
So it says (speaks Korean) on this side

63
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:14,361
and (speaks Korean) on the other.

64
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:18,236
And this is a longer hoodie so
that way it covers your butt.

65
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,874
You can wear it as a dress

66
00:02:19,874 --> 00:02:22,660
or you can just wear it over
like a jeans and a t-shirt.

67
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,897
This is something that
is super easy to style,

68
00:02:24,897 --> 00:02:27,677
a wardrobe basic and very very cozy.

69
00:02:27,677 --> 00:02:29,201
So this is the last piece of outerwear

70
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:31,436
and it is called the two tone hoodie.

71
00:02:31,436 --> 00:02:33,143
It comes in two color ways.

72
00:02:33,143 --> 00:02:35,738
One is in this nice beige and white

73
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,279
and the other is in a red and gray.

74
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:41,022
And I just wore a lot of
hoodies in high school,

75
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,495
and I wanted to just jazz it up

76
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,424
by making something mismatched.

77
00:02:44,424 --> 00:02:46,620
I feel like this hoodie
would also look really cute

78
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,701
with some thigh-highs,
or you can just wear it

79
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:50,759
like off the shoulder as a dress.

80
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,134
I think that would be super cute.

81
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:54,502
But yeah I think this
is a really fun piece

82
00:02:54,502 --> 00:02:56,366
to wear on its own or to layer with.

83
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:58,291
Now I'm gonna move on to some tops.

84
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,363
Here is a no-brainer basic.

85
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:02,133
This is called the Charlotte top,

86
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:04,975
and yes this is named after
Charlotte from Sex and the City

87
00:03:04,975 --> 00:03:07,227
because it's elegant and chic.

88
00:03:07,227 --> 00:03:09,861
This comes in two color
ways, black and periwinkle.

89
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:12,512
And it has this lettuce
ribbing all over the top,

90
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,819
and a cute keyhole that you can adjust.

91
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,019
The size does run a little bit large,

92
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:20,126
so make sure if you are
interested in this to size down.

93
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:22,597
The next item is a really
sentimental one to me.

94
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,876
This is called the Love Letter Romper.

95
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:27,261
So basically I went
into my childhood room,

96
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:29,119
and I found this box of letters.

97
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:32,318
And I thought it'd be really
cool to put them up on a shirt.

98
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,296
So on the left side I've got a letter

99
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,580
from my very first
boyfriend when I was 13.

100
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,841
And then on the right side
I've got a love letter

101
00:03:38,841 --> 00:03:40,945
from a crush from summer camp.

102
00:03:40,945 --> 00:03:43,283
You can't really see what the message is

103
00:03:43,283 --> 00:03:45,367
because I wanted to respect their privacy.

104
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:48,520
So yeah it's a little distorted
but they're still on there.

105
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,643
The greatest part about this shirt though,

106
00:03:50,643 --> 00:03:53,233
is the fact that this
is actually a romper.

107
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,650
This was my designer's idea, Angela.

108
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,137
So thank you so much for that.

109
00:03:57,137 --> 00:03:58,714
So yeah we just wanted to create a piece

110
00:03:58,714 --> 00:04:00,978
that was comfy and secure.

111
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:02,640
I love going out, so I wanted to make sure

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,304
that I had some pieces that I could wear

113
00:04:04,304 --> 00:04:07,338
on like a night dancing
or out with the girls.

114
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:09,484
So here is the Wrap Tank.

115
00:04:09,484 --> 00:04:11,316
This looks like a hot mess on the hanger.

116
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:13,484
But trust me when you put it on it's cute.

117
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:17,052
This is a ribbed tank that is fitted,

118
00:04:17,052 --> 00:04:18,757
and it just wraps around the waist.

119
00:04:18,757 --> 00:04:20,780
It definitely is a sexy
little number to rock

120
00:04:20,781 --> 00:04:22,123
when you wanna bear some skin.

121
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,440
Next up I have the K-Tank.

122
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,986
There are just normal
spaghetti strap tops,

123
00:04:25,986 --> 00:04:27,257
with a contrast trim

124
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:29,274
and a little Korean slogan in the middle.

125
00:04:29,274 --> 00:04:31,361
The first one says (speaks Korean),

126
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,156
which means your mom in Korean.

127
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:37,217
Then I have fighting, which is
a phrase like you can do it.

128
00:04:37,217 --> 00:04:38,852
And then I have (speaks Korean)

129
00:04:38,852 --> 00:04:41,251
which means let's play or
like let's hang out in Korean.

130
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,873
These are really cute tanks

131
00:04:42,873 --> 00:04:45,159
that you can wear on their own or layered.

132
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,445
Winter is coming, so
staying snuggly is a must.

133
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,985
That's why I made more long sleeves.

134
00:04:49,985 --> 00:04:52,230
This is the O Dang long sleeve

135
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,725
and o dang means fish cake in Korean

136
00:04:54,725 --> 00:04:57,247
so that's why there are fish
cakes where the nips are.

137
00:04:57,247 --> 00:05:01,337
This comes in three colors,
this one is in a dusty blue,

138
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:03,897
the other is in a dusty maroon

139
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,833
and the last one is in a classic white.

140
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,395
Moving on to another graphic tee,

141
00:05:07,395 --> 00:05:10,255
This is the nobody puts
Eggie in the corner.

142
00:05:10,255 --> 00:05:14,215
Obviously this is a play on
"nobody puts baby in the corner"

143
00:05:14,215 --> 00:05:15,799
but I just replaced Eggie.

144
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,788
This is in a really kind
of like metal band font,

145
00:05:19,788 --> 00:05:21,397
because it kind of just reminds me

146
00:05:21,397 --> 00:05:24,258
of all the metal bands that I
used to wear in high school.

147
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:26,752
Overall it's just a
very comfortable shirt,

148
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,564
that you can rock on casual days.

149
00:05:28,564 --> 00:05:31,014
The last graphic tee that I
have is the Blur Baby top.

150
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:32,798
This is a cute crop top

151
00:05:32,798 --> 00:05:34,956
that has the graphic Eggie in the front.

152
00:05:34,956 --> 00:05:38,053
I just love the blur
effect because it's quirky,

153
00:05:38,053 --> 00:05:39,813
and it just, I don't know,

154
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:41,795
makes it seem like time's
going by really fast.

155
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,180
I've always considered
graphic tops as a basic,

156
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,645
so that's why I wanted to add
more of them to my collection.

157
00:05:46,645 --> 00:05:48,672
I consider polka dots a timeless trend,

158
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:51,084
so naturally I wanted to
add some into my collection.

159
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,864
This is called the Spot Top,

160
00:05:52,864 --> 00:05:55,033
and it's just an off the shoulder blouse

161
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:57,361
with this gorgeous dot
pattern all over it.

162
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:59,469
It's got cutouts on the sleeves,

163
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:03,481
and it has a nice ruffle on
the shoulder and the ends.

164
00:06:03,481 --> 00:06:06,280
This is really cute to wear
with high-waisted things

165
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,421
because it's so cropped,

166
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:09,129
and it's just like nice item to wear

167
00:06:09,129 --> 00:06:10,984
when you wanna look all spruced up.

168
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:12,098
The other polka dotted item

169
00:06:12,098 --> 00:06:13,771
is one that I'm wearing right now.

170
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:15,861
This is called the Dot Jumpsuit,

171
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:17,588
and this is a daring number

172
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:19,374
for those who just wanna strut their stuff

173
00:06:19,374 --> 00:06:20,702
in a power jumpsuit.

174
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:22,628
I love that it elongates you

175
00:06:22,628 --> 00:06:25,052
and it's just easy to
take it from day to night.

176
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:26,765
This is clearly one of my favorite pieces

177
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:28,203
because I'm rocking it right now.

178
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:30,261
I wore it with a long sleeve

179
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:32,273
just so it's warmer for the weather.

180
00:06:32,273 --> 00:06:34,346
The sun keeps coming into my room,

181
00:06:34,346 --> 00:06:36,919
so I've been like scooting
further and further back.

182
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,609
But basically, here is the next item.

183
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:43,133
So this comes in two pieces,
first I have the Connor top.

184
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:47,079
This is a strapless top with
this awesome contrast stitching

185
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:48,485
so that way it really pops.

186
00:06:48,485 --> 00:06:51,580
It's got this cute ruffle detail
on the top and the bottom,

187
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,606
and this top coordinates
perfectly with the Connor pants.

188
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:57,568
These are definitely one of
the most comfortable pants

189
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:58,936
that I've ever worn.

190
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,114
They are very loose and baggy,

191
00:07:01,114 --> 00:07:02,494
but fitted on the waist

192
00:07:02,494 --> 00:07:04,335
so they look perfect with the top.

193
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:06,421
This set is named after Sarah Connor

194
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:09,177
who is probably like the
most badass woman in film.

195
00:07:09,177 --> 00:07:12,815
So I wanted to just dedicate
a piece of clothing to her.

196
00:07:12,815 --> 00:07:15,130
Here are some more trousers that I love.

197
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,729
These are called the Late Shift trouser,

198
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:19,197
and they come in two
colors, black and olive.

199
00:07:19,197 --> 00:07:23,167
They kind of remind me of a work pant,

200
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,887
but way softer and definitely more chic.

201
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:28,778
They are also high-waisted
and the bottoms are

202
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:30,697
still baggy but not as baggy

203
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,113
but not as baggy as the Connor pant.

204
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:34,800
The highlight of these pants
are definitely the chain.

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,885
It's in this really awesome gold,

206
00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:38,874
and it's quite substantial,
it's pretty heavy.

207
00:07:38,874 --> 00:07:39,989
And if you like the chain,

208
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:41,126
you can move it on over to any

209
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:43,022
of the other pants in your closet.

210
00:07:43,022 --> 00:07:44,046
As I mentioned before,

211
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,781
I'm having a huge moment
with red right now.

212
00:07:46,781 --> 00:07:48,941
So here are the Bench Warmers.

213
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:50,575
They're these sick red joggers

214
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:52,242
with this white striping on the sides.

215
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:53,885
This is just a really nice tailored jogger

216
00:07:53,885 --> 00:07:55,200
in a fun red print.

217
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,047
And I feel like they're a great way

218
00:07:57,047 --> 00:08:00,040
to play with the sports lux
trend that's going on right now.

219
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,040
So we only have two more
items left in the haul

220
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,366
and they're both skirts.

221
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,359
Here is the Criss Cross skirt.

222
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,381
This is a tight black and red miniskirt

223
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,428
with this cross stitching on the side.

224
00:08:09,428 --> 00:08:10,496
I feel like red and black

225
00:08:10,496 --> 00:08:12,337
is such a classic color combination

226
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:14,591
and I just love how striking it comes off.

227
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,864
Alright the final item
is the Clueless skirt,

228
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:19,624
and I feel like this name
is pretty self-explanatory.

229
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:23,098
It's inspired by the 90s
classic film, Clueless.

230
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,384
And you can channel your
inner Cher with this skirt.

231
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:28,658
So that is a wrap on the haul,

232
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:30,983
please head over to Eggie.us
if you are interested

233
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,212
in any of the pieces.

234
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,920
Also I have a huge announcement

235
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,785
for the international Eggies out there.

236
00:08:35,785 --> 00:08:37,791
I know shipping has been brutal,

237
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,517
I know some of you guys
have been paying 50 60 bucks

238
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:42,554
for shipping and I know
it's been unreasonable.

239
00:08:42,554 --> 00:08:45,122
But I have been working
on this with my team,

240
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:48,366
to lower the cost and we
have finally succeeded.

241
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:50,330
So for most places it should be around

242
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,246
seven to 15 bucks for shipping now.

243
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:54,596
There are some places that are excluded,

244
00:08:54,596 --> 00:08:56,100
they're still like 30 bucks.

245
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,792
But there's gonna be a
list, like a full list,

246
00:08:58,792 --> 00:09:01,689
on eggie.us so please head
on over to the website

247
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:03,819
to see what your shipping costs are.

248
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:06,730
I've been getting so many
DMs and comments and messages

249
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,065
about this issue and so I've
been working on it so hard

250
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:12,031
and I'm so happy that it happened.

251
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:14,824
So thank you so much for you
know, voicing your concerns,

252
00:09:14,824 --> 00:09:16,822
and I will do anything that I possibly can

253
00:09:16,822 --> 00:09:19,130
to make your requests a reality.

254
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,523
I wanna thank you guys
so much for watching,

255
00:09:21,523 --> 00:09:23,805
And I will see you guys in the next one.

256
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:24,914
Bye!

257
00:09:24,914 --> 00:00:00,000
(blows kiss)
