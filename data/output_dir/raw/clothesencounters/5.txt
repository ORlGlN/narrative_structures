1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:01,102
- Hi everyone.

2
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:04,183
I'm Jenn Im and today I'll
be meeting some athletes

3
00:00:04,183 --> 00:00:06,054
who are going to be
representing the United States

4
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:08,551
in the Winter Olympic and Paralympic games

5
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,555
in South Korea, Pyeongchang in 2018.

6
00:00:11,555 --> 00:00:13,508
Korean culture is known for their beauty

7
00:00:13,508 --> 00:00:15,583
and cosmetic lines so we're gonna put each

8
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:19,019
Olympic hopeful to participate
in one of three games.

9
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,854
And this episode is Place the Face.

10
00:00:21,854 --> 00:00:24,543
We're gonna throw each athlete
into the K-Beauty gauntlet,

11
00:00:24,543 --> 00:00:26,725
and see who comes out on top.

12
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:28,667
So lets go ahead and meet our athletes.

13
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:30,639
Hey guys, so here we have Evan.

14
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:32,597
Thank you so much for joining us today.

15
00:00:32,597 --> 00:00:33,601
- Good to be here.

16
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:34,752
Thank you for having me.

17
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:35,585
(laughs)

18
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:37,409
- So today we're gonna
really focus on K-Beauty

19
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:39,754
and it's gonna be pretty challenging.

20
00:00:39,754 --> 00:00:41,704
This is one of my favorite
challenges actually.

21
00:00:41,704 --> 00:00:45,567
So we're gonna do a game called
The Facts and the Furious.

22
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,728
So three simple questions you will answer.

23
00:00:48,728 --> 00:00:49,717
- Musubi.

24
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,602
- Musubi?

25
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:52,079
Like spam musubi?

26
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,218
- Maybe katsu musubi.

27
00:00:53,218 --> 00:00:54,927
- Well I love spam.

28
00:00:54,927 --> 00:00:55,949
- Mexican food.

29
00:00:55,949 --> 00:00:56,992
- Mexican food?

30
00:00:56,992 --> 00:00:57,902
You like spicy food then?

31
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:01,047
- Yeah spicy where it still has flavor.

32
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:02,897
- Oh so it's not to the point
where it's like hurting you.

33
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,730
- Yean, exactly.

34
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,563
(both laugh)

35
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:05,396
- For sure.

36
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:08,112
What's one song or artist
that's been on repeat lately?

37
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:10,840
- Definitely that
Kendrick Lamar, "Humble."

38
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,045
- I love Kendrick.

39
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:13,366
- That thing gets me jumpin'.

40
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:14,426
- "Stay" by Zedd.

41
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,555
- He's amazing live.

42
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:16,685
- It's a real ear worm though.

43
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:17,675
Just gets in there.

44
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:21,255
- My definite go to song is
DMX, "X Gon Give it to Ya."

45
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,088
- Oh hell yeah!

46
00:01:22,088 --> 00:01:23,560
- It's a great pump up.
- Oh my god.

47
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,133
- You start dancing, you bark a little,

48
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:29,657
weird people out, but
it's pretty much my go to.

49
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,121
- No seriously, every
time that song comes on

50
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:32,251
in a bar or a club everyone's just

51
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,600
"Alright, we're doing this!"

52
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,433
- Exactly.

53
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,793
- That's a great song choice.

54
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:36,943
We're gonna play the game!

55
00:01:36,943 --> 00:01:38,915
It's called Place the Face.

56
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:39,748
- Ready?

57
00:01:39,748 --> 00:01:40,581
- Oh!

58
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:41,414
(grunts)

59
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:42,408
Not ready for that.

60
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:44,902
On the table, I've got three go to

61
00:01:44,902 --> 00:01:46,955
Korean products that I love.

62
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,823
First we've got the BB Cushion.

63
00:01:48,823 --> 00:01:50,104
And if you don't know what that is,

64
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,527
this is what girls put on
their face as the base.

65
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,651
- I think they joke and
call it Bondo, right?

66
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:56,812
The guys call it Bondo like on the car.

67
00:01:56,812 --> 00:01:58,192
You know, when you got a little bowl

68
00:01:58,192 --> 00:01:59,383
and you kinda patch it up.

69
00:01:59,383 --> 00:02:00,216
- Oh my god!

70
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:01,200
(both laugh)

71
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,839
Yes, this is our Bondo for our face.

72
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:06,021
Second, we've got some eye shadow sticks,

73
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,901
and the last one is a lipstick.

74
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:09,358
Add some color to your lips.

75
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:10,282
Pucker up.

76
00:02:10,282 --> 00:02:12,678
And the best part is you're
not going to do it on my face,

77
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:16,873
but you're gonna do it on
this lovely woman here.

78
00:02:16,873 --> 00:02:19,109
Obviously doing this blindfolded as well,

79
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:21,940
so you've got something
to, I know, ya know?

80
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,472
Okay let's put you into
position, over here.

81
00:02:25,472 --> 00:02:26,555
Okay, and go!

82
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,731
Oh.

83
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:30,622
Okay.

84
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:31,957
- This is gonna be.

85
00:02:31,957 --> 00:02:34,307
- Hey, you're off to a pretty good start.

86
00:02:34,307 --> 00:02:36,260
- I don't know what a cat eye is.

87
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,943
- Just flick it at the end.

88
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:39,251
Flick it.

89
00:02:39,251 --> 00:02:40,259
Now for the lips.

90
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:41,379
Alright.

91
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:42,629
And you're off.

92
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,676
Yeah, okay, okay.

93
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,339
Fantastic.

94
00:02:49,339 --> 00:02:50,840
- I'm not very good at this.

95
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,755
(both laugh)

96
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,368
- Wow, it's really low, isn't it?

97
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:54,922
- Yeah, those are some big lips.

98
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:55,755
Okay.

99
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:57,466
Not bad.

100
00:02:58,356 --> 00:02:59,189
Oh, god.

101
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,022
- Oh, no.

102
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:00,855
That's way off.

103
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:01,824
- Oh my gosh.

104
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,292
That's pretty darn close, actually.

105
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,125
- Can I have a little more?

106
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:04,958
- Yeah.

107
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:06,749
- Am I on the eye?

108
00:03:06,749 --> 00:03:09,050
- You're close enough to be honest, yeah.

109
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,217
Or you're more down south.

110
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:16,512
Oh, yeah that's one way to do it.

111
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:17,838
- You said go for it.

112
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:18,930
- Yeah.

113
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,243
- I'm assuming her lips are right there.

114
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,235
- High cheek bones, I gotcha.
- Yeah.

115
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,283
And come right back across the face right?

116
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,118
On that high cheek bone again.

117
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,331
Gotta get that Bondo in,

118
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:30,217
and you have to sand it down

119
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:31,545
'cause if you don't get it sanded down

120
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,562
you'll see it when you
paint the car, you know?

121
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,866
I'm gonna say it's
about right there, yeah?

122
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,809
Look at that eye, right?

123
00:03:37,809 --> 00:03:39,998
- Make sure you flick it at
the end for the little cat eye.

124
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:40,831
- You gotta give her that cat.

125
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:42,440
- Yeah, there you go, there you go.

126
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,273
(laughs)

127
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:45,012
- My masterpiece is complete.

128
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:47,694
- I think we have the new
Picasso here, alright.

129
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,875
Ready to see it?

130
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,955
(both laugh)

131
00:03:50,955 --> 00:03:51,788
- Wow!

132
00:03:51,788 --> 00:03:53,343
- This one was really good.
- I actually go them.

133
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:54,547
- This one was really good.

134
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:56,735
- Oh wow, not bad right?
- Yeah.

135
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:59,402
- This one I was very impressed.

136
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:01,768
Oh my god!

137
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:02,962
She's fiery.

138
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:03,833
- I don't know she would be a mean wahena.

139
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:04,789
(both laugh)

140
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:06,043
Tried to give her some horns.

141
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:06,876
- Do I look?

142
00:04:06,876 --> 00:04:07,709
- Yeah.

143
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:09,551
- Oh not too bad.
- Yeah, right?

144
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,393
- You pretty much.

145
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:11,499
- Got it in her eye.

146
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,099
Some people like the nude
look on their lips so.

147
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:14,605
- Exactly.

148
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:16,151
- Oh my gosh.

149
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:18,153
- Like, come on.

150
00:04:18,153 --> 00:04:19,831
- Not even close to the lip.

151
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,412
- It's okay, I mean we
all have our strengths.

152
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:23,245
- Yeah.

153
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:24,078
- Yeah?

154
00:04:24,078 --> 00:04:24,911
- Makeup is not mine.

155
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,128
(laughs)

156
00:04:26,128 --> 00:04:29,167
- Well that concludes
K-Beauty with NBC Olympics.

157
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:30,638
I feel like the athletes are ready

158
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:32,034
to dominate their sports

159
00:04:32,034 --> 00:04:34,214
and maintain a great complexion.

160
00:04:34,214 --> 00:04:36,197
Thank you so much for watch America,

161
00:04:36,197 --> 00:00:00,000
and I'll be seeing you in Pyeongchang.
