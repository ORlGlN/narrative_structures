1
00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:03,988
(upbeat electronic music)

2
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:06,926
- Hi, everyone, it's ya girl, Jenn,

3
00:00:06,926 --> 00:00:10,389
and I'm so happy that the holiday
season is officially here.

4
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,267
This is my favorite time of year

5
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:14,160
because there is so much going on,

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,972
like parties, lots of
food, and just more reasons

7
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:19,102
to get dolled up or stay cozy.

8
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,459
Today, I'm gonna be talking about

9
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:24,409
the newest additions to Eggie,
which is my clothing line.

10
00:00:24,409 --> 00:00:26,437
If you guys are interested
in any of the other

11
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:29,381
collections that I've created,
head on over to the cards.

12
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:30,437
I'll leave them up there.

13
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:32,433
But let me focus on this drop.

14
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,907
I wanted to create pieces that would

15
00:00:34,907 --> 00:00:36,776
just reflect any type of situation

16
00:00:36,776 --> 00:00:39,823
you might find yourself this time of year

17
00:00:39,823 --> 00:00:43,058
and I'm so excited to just go through

18
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:46,163
every item, piece by piece,
so let's get started.

19
00:00:46,163 --> 00:00:47,664
So I'm gonna start with dresses first.

20
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:50,603
Here is the Lady's in Chain slip.

21
00:00:50,603 --> 00:00:53,294
I wanted to put in something
super glam for all the ladies

22
00:00:53,294 --> 00:00:55,284
who just want to shine on New Year's Eve

23
00:00:55,284 --> 00:00:56,586
or any holiday event.

24
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:58,475
If you want to channel your inner Samantha

25
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,358
from Sex in the City, this is your dress.

26
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:05,125
It's in this really
slinky, satin material and

27
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,027
just the chains, it is so industrial

28
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,501
and I love how it contrasts with such a,

29
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,564
like, a feminine fabric.

30
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,414
I highly recommend this black dress

31
00:01:14,414 --> 00:01:15,813
if you don't have a little black dress

32
00:01:15,813 --> 00:01:18,871
already in your closet, this
could be the one for you.

33
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,291
During this time of year,
there are a lot of options

34
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,135
for shindigs and parties,
and so I wanted to create

35
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:25,925
another going out look.

36
00:01:25,925 --> 00:01:27,453
This is a set.

37
00:01:27,453 --> 00:01:30,663
This is Trunchbull top
and the Trunchbull skirt

38
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:34,369
and I named it after Miss
Trunchbull from Matilda.

39
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:37,430
She is the boss, takes no crap from anyone

40
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,667
and this outfit just kind
of embodied that for me.

41
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:43,298
This set definitely
exudes, like, professional,

42
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:46,738
demanding vibes because
of the pinstripe pattern.

43
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:48,785
But in order to not make is so stuffy,

44
00:01:48,785 --> 00:01:53,028
I thought that these nice
exposure details in the middle

45
00:01:53,028 --> 00:01:55,425
would really lighten it
up and make it shine.

46
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:59,107
I love this set and I
like that even though

47
00:01:59,107 --> 00:02:01,650
I'm technically covered
up, it still feels sensual

48
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,574
because it's so bodycon.

49
00:02:03,574 --> 00:02:06,051
Next up I have the Miss Honey dress,

50
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:08,610
which is named after the
sweet and nurturing teacher

51
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,874
from Matlida.

52
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:13,468
Basically, the complete
opposite of the Trunchbull,

53
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:16,671
but yeah, this is just a
really sweet and modest

54
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,731
yet chic dress that you can rock

55
00:02:18,731 --> 00:02:20,954
to maybe, like, a family dinner,

56
00:02:20,954 --> 00:02:23,655
meeting the parents, or church.

57
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:27,043
I just wanted to create
something that was longer

58
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:29,787
because I know I have a lot
of miniskirts and minidresses,

59
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:33,527
so this is a nice, fresh
silhouette that you guys can rock.

60
00:02:33,527 --> 00:02:36,910
It's midi- but in case you
want to show some extra skin,

61
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,833
you can pop open a couple
buttons and flash that leg.

62
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:43,343
I must mention that it also has pockets.

63
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:44,873
I wanted to make sure that my ladies

64
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,245
had somewhere to put their
hands during awkward situations

65
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:50,539
or maybe you just need
somewhere to store your phone.

66
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:53,115
Basically, pockets are
always a great option

67
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:54,683
and this dress has it.

68
00:02:54,683 --> 00:02:56,779
Next up is the Delilah dress.

69
00:02:56,779 --> 00:02:58,999
This dress has got a really nice,

70
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,865
thick, substantial material to it

71
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:03,386
and I just love anything off the shoulder,

72
00:03:03,386 --> 00:03:05,149
so this is perfect for those of you

73
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:06,783
who want to show a little decolletage.

74
00:03:06,783 --> 00:03:08,448
I'm also a huge fan of polka dots

75
00:03:08,448 --> 00:03:10,473
because they're just a timeless print.

76
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,155
I love billowy sleeves and I feel like

77
00:03:13,155 --> 00:03:15,047
this dress really plays
with your proportions

78
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:16,886
in all the best ways.

79
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:20,188
The last dress I have is
the Queen of Diamonds slip.

80
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:22,754
This is just like your
traditional slip silhouette

81
00:03:22,754 --> 00:03:25,472
but with a very contemporary
checkered print.

82
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,927
It has this black lace
trimming on the front

83
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:29,778
and the bottom and it just adds

84
00:03:29,778 --> 00:03:31,549
a nice feminine detail to it.

85
00:03:31,549 --> 00:03:34,647
For a night out, I would
wear this just on its own

86
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,611
with a red lip and earrings,

87
00:03:36,611 --> 00:03:38,896
but if I wanted to just
make it more casual,

88
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,487
you could just throw a sweater over it.

89
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:42,936
All right, so let's move
on over to outerwear.

90
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:45,438
Here is the Holiday Cozy cardigan.

91
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:49,112
This is a remake of the
Cozy Cardigan from drop one,

92
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,754
but we made a couple
of different additions.

93
00:03:51,754 --> 00:03:55,046
For example, the fabric is a lot softer.

94
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:58,028
It's in this really nice, buttery knit.

95
00:03:58,028 --> 00:04:00,310
We've also made it a vibrant red,

96
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,368
which is perfect for the holidays.

97
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:04,983
And, lastly, we've added pockets.

98
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:06,997
The Cozy Cardigan was
one of our best sellers,

99
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,438
so I thought that we would create just one

100
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,322
with some modifications and

101
00:04:11,322 --> 00:04:13,216
something that is really festive.

102
00:04:13,216 --> 00:04:15,903
Also, I feel like even after Christmas,

103
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:18,339
this cardigan can be worn in the spring

104
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:21,887
because red is still having
a huge moment right now.

105
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,305
So this next jacket is
hands down my favorite.

106
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,838
This is the I'll Be Back anorak

107
00:04:26,838 --> 00:04:30,570
and I love the fact that I
could see anybody rocking this.

108
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,609
It's definitely the most unisex piece.

109
00:04:32,609 --> 00:04:35,353
It's in this sick camo print
with checkered detailing

110
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:36,664
all over the sleeves.

111
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:38,656
It's also very oversized.

112
00:04:38,656 --> 00:04:40,192
What I'm wearing right now is a small,

113
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,451
so you can really layer any piece with it.

114
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:43,955
It's kind of like your modern-day cape

115
00:04:43,955 --> 00:04:45,922
if you were, like, a
superhero or something.

116
00:04:45,922 --> 00:04:47,425
That's where I actually got the name.

117
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:51,683
It is a nod to the Terminator
when he says, "I'll be back."

118
00:04:51,683 --> 00:04:53,675
I feel like he'd be wearing this anorak.

119
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:56,534
The last jacket I have is the Luna hoodie.

120
00:04:56,534 --> 00:04:59,433
This is so luxurious and soft.

121
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:01,661
This honestly feels
like I'm petting Cheeki.

122
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:04,191
It's so soft but it's faux fur.

123
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:07,587
This is a cropped zip-up hoodie
with gold chain detailing.

124
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:11,487
It also has a cute little E
for Eggie charm at the end.

125
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:15,049
This also this satin lining
and it feels really good

126
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,970
to slip into and I'm wearing a size large

127
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,546
because I just wanted something
that was more oversized,

128
00:05:20,546 --> 00:05:21,809
something that I could just, you know,

129
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:23,485
chuck on over anything, but if you want

130
00:05:23,485 --> 00:05:27,283
something more fitted, definitely
go for the smaller sizes.

131
00:05:27,283 --> 00:05:30,351
So the last category is tops
and so I'm gonna talk about

132
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:32,175
the sweater that I'm rocking right now.

133
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,448
This is the Salmon Stripe sweater.

134
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:37,947
This is just your every day cozy sweater.

135
00:05:37,947 --> 00:05:39,121
You can wear it to class.

136
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,331
You can wear it home.

137
00:05:40,331 --> 00:05:41,970
You can wear it to the grocery store.

138
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,562
I thought I would just play around

139
00:05:43,562 --> 00:05:45,455
with the stripe sizing by having some

140
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,301
fat stripes on the chest and

141
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:49,329
some thin stripes on the sleeves.

142
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,217
It's just a really
quirky, every day sweater

143
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:54,241
that you might love.

144
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:56,923
Next up I have the Hot and Cold turtleneck

145
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,434
and I named it this because

146
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:01,523
even though it's in a
traditional turtleneck silhouette

147
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:03,821
that's supposed to keep you
warm, it will not do that

148
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,464
because it's in this mesh material.

149
00:06:06,464 --> 00:06:09,398
Basically, I would say that
this has no functionality to it

150
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:10,989
but it's purely for the aesthetic

151
00:06:10,989 --> 00:06:12,849
and I live for pieces like this.

152
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,517
This is definitely a look.

153
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:17,037
I would rock this layered with dresses

154
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:20,667
or overalls or something, or,
if you're just gonna wear it

155
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,414
on its own, I would recommend

156
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:25,325
wearing a black bodysuit
or a black bralette.

157
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:27,797
The last top I have is the Check Mate tank

158
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:29,850
and this silhouette is pretty similar

159
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,575
to the Lady's in Chains
dress because it has that

160
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,183
same draping effect on the front.

161
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:36,671
I feel like this is really flattering

162
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:40,235
and it's also in that really
luxurious satin material.

163
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:42,677
I love this fabric
because it just makes you

164
00:06:42,677 --> 00:06:44,267
feel like a million bucks.

165
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:46,070
So that is a wrap on the haul.

166
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,671
I hope you guys enjoyed the pieces.

167
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:51,681
I honestly had so much fun
designing this capsule collection

168
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,744
and I can't wait to see how

169
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:54,571
all these pieces look like on you.

170
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:58,082
If you would like to follow
our Instagram @eggieshop,

171
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,703
feel free to do so, there's a
lot more inspiration on there.

172
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:02,395
If you're interested in the pieces,

173
00:07:02,395 --> 00:07:05,733
head on over to eggie.us
and I'll also leave a link

174
00:07:05,733 --> 00:07:08,092
in the downbar, so please check that out.

175
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:10,202
I want to thank you guys
so much for watching.

176
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,854
I'm gonna head out because
this lighting is horrendous.

177
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:15,227
I need to make a note
to myself not to film

178
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:19,340
past 2:30 because the light
just gets progressively worse.

179
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,217
Anyway, I hope you guys
are having a beautiful day

180
00:07:22,217 --> 00:07:23,866
and I'll see you guys in the next one.

181
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:24,865
Bye!

182
00:07:24,865 --> 00:00:00,000
(relaxed music)
