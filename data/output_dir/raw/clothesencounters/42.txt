1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,083
(whimsical keyboard music)

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,061
- Today is the day of my lunch.

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:13,769
We are at the Lombardi House

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:16,142
and check out this freaking barn, guys!

5
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:17,350
Look at this installation,

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,425
these are all balloons!

7
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:22,384
And, they're weighted perfectly
by some water balloons.

8
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:23,710
So, it's just

9
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,009
perfectly balanced.

10
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:26,824
I literally can't believe it.

11
00:00:26,824 --> 00:00:29,488
Now I'm just waiting for all
my friends to come through.

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,775
This is amazing!

13
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:32,110
Absolutely incredible!

14
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,263
I'm just,

15
00:00:33,263 --> 00:00:34,190
my emotions are everywhere,

16
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,217
I couldn't be happier. (laughs)

17
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:39,050
(whimsical music)

18
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:00,237
- Hey!

19
00:01:00,237 --> 00:01:02,687
We are all sitting down now

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,470
about to nom

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,851
on some freaking delicious food.

22
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:07,204
I'm so excited about this!

23
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:09,276
- This is the menu I picked out myself.

24
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:11,011
A lot of Korean bites,

25
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,755
we got kimchi fried rice.

26
00:01:12,755 --> 00:01:16,338
(whimsical keyboard music)

27
00:01:55,188 --> 00:01:58,302
- [Crowd] Speech, speech, speech!

28
00:01:58,302 --> 00:02:00,085
- Thank you guys so much for being here.

29
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,134
You guys could have been
anywhere in the world,

30
00:02:02,134 --> 00:02:04,037
but you chose to come to my lunch,

31
00:02:04,037 --> 00:02:05,952
and I am so grateful.

32
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:08,869
This whole experience has just been

33
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:11,952
just incredibly surreal
and I feel so lucky

34
00:02:11,952 --> 00:02:14,102
to know each and every single one of you.

35
00:02:14,102 --> 00:02:15,593
Each one of you guys have made

36
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,578
such an impact on my life

37
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,052
whether you know it or not,

38
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:19,807
and thank you so much for being here.

39
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:20,687
Cheers!

40
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:23,109
(crowd cheers)

41
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:26,692
(whimsical keyboard music)

42
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,959
- What a freaking day!

43
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,126
It is 9:30 now

44
00:02:55,536 --> 00:02:59,700
and I just ordered some food on Postmates.

45
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,618
I didn't really know what I was craving,

46
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:03,008
and then I just thought,

47
00:03:03,008 --> 00:03:04,183
you know what, I'm just gonna go for some

48
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,099
classic burgers and fries

49
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,560
and onion rings.

50
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,469
(laughs)

51
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:12,653
This place is called Burgerim.

52
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:13,686
I thought it was really funny

53
00:03:13,686 --> 00:03:16,670
because it's got my last name in it.

54
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,576
But, yeah,

55
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:20,485
today was so unbelievable.

56
00:03:20,485 --> 00:03:22,522
I couldn't even believe

57
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:23,843
what happened.

58
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,822
It just, everything happened so quickly.

59
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,572
Today was one of the
fastest days of my life,

60
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:32,785
and I just feel so grateful for

61
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:34,060
all my friends that showed up

62
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,568
and for the support that I received

63
00:03:36,568 --> 00:03:39,750
and also reading all you guys' comments

64
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,667
about the line has been so encouraging

65
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:44,709
and I can't thank you guys enough.

66
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:45,709
I feel good.

67
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:47,120
I think when I first got home,

68
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,972
I was just completely drained

69
00:03:49,972 --> 00:03:52,452
because it was a whole group of,

70
00:03:52,452 --> 00:03:54,152
I think around,

71
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:55,556
50 people were there,

72
00:03:55,556 --> 00:03:57,233
trying to get every single one of them.

73
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,333
It was so fun,

74
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,666
but now I just need to just recharge,

75
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:02,665
be alone,

76
00:04:02,665 --> 00:04:03,934
enjoy these,

77
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,509
these fries.

78
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:06,390
Look, look.

79
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,222
They're like the shape of a potato chip,

80
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:10,305
but they're french fries.

81
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:12,515
That's good,

82
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:13,988
that's real good.

83
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:15,451
I bought three burgers,

84
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,632
which is really cool.

85
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,948
I'm at a point where if 2017
is the year that I peak,

86
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:21,680
I am at peace with that as well.

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,106
I lived a freaking blessed life,

88
00:04:24,106 --> 00:04:26,096
and I am just,

89
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:27,797
I'm just over the moon.

90
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:30,316
Thank you guys so much.

91
00:04:30,316 --> 00:04:32,251
I'm gonna enjoy this now

92
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:34,883
and watch my YouTube videos.

93
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:35,807
- [Man] Yeah, whatever.

94
00:04:35,807 --> 00:04:37,149
- [Woman] Listen, if Game of
Thrones can mess with time,

95
00:04:37,149 --> 00:04:37,982
so can we.

96
00:04:37,982 --> 00:04:39,048
- [Jenn] Yeah, that's true.

97
00:04:39,048 --> 00:04:40,368
- [Woman] (laughs)

98
00:04:40,368 --> 00:04:41,286
- Hey guys!

99
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:44,827
So it is 5 o'clock, I'm
stuck in rush hour traffic,

100
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:46,307
which is very unfortunate.

101
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:49,561
I'm driving back from the Pop
Sugar interview that I did.

102
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:52,069
I did an episode of Pretty
Unfiltered with Kirby,

103
00:04:52,069 --> 00:04:53,584
she was so wonderful!

104
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,500
What a great host!

105
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,141
And, everybody at the Pop Sugar family,

106
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,851
so nice, love them.

107
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:01,091
And, it was cool doing
that whole experience,

108
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,049
because she asked a lot of questions

109
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:05,271
that I normally don't get asked.

110
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,341
For example,

111
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:08,135
like my Korean-American background

112
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:10,249
and what it was like being

113
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:11,722
just Asian-American growing up.

114
00:05:11,722 --> 00:05:13,700
The plan is I'm gonna to pick up Cheeky

115
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,072
and then I'm gonna drive
over to my parents house.

116
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,993
I haven't seen my dad in like three weeks.

117
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,326
So, it would be really nice to see him.

118
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:22,763
And, I don't know,

119
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,090
I know when I see them I'm
gonna feel a lot better.

120
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,540
I think I'm just having one of those days

121
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,673
where I just feel kind of off

122
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,420
and I'm being way too hard on myself

123
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,026
because I know the interview went fine,

124
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:33,887
I just,

125
00:05:33,887 --> 00:05:36,253
I'm just like picking myself apart.

126
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,086
- [Jenn] (laughs)

127
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:42,521
Cheeky, go play with Haraguchi.

128
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:44,614
(laughs)

129
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:47,472
For tonight's menu, oma has made

130
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,496
bokkeumbap!

131
00:05:48,496 --> 00:05:50,372
- [Oma] Bokkeumbap.

132
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:51,845
- And then of course,

133
00:05:51,845 --> 00:05:53,725
kimchi chicken!

134
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:54,558
(speaks in foreign language)

135
00:05:54,558 --> 00:05:55,641
[Oma] Mm-hmm.

136
00:05:58,421 --> 00:05:59,254
- Mm, mm.

137
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:01,809
Too much salt.

138
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:02,858
[Oma] Too much salt?

139
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:03,858
- [Jenn] So, this is my mom,

140
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:06,941
wearing the wide trouser pant outfit.

141
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:09,460
[Oma] (speaks in foreign language)

142
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,510
- [Jenn] (speaks in foreign language)

143
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,501
Very comfortable, huh?

144
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:12,334
- Very comfortable.

145
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:14,898
[Jenn] (laughs)

146
00:06:14,898 --> 00:06:16,632
(both speaking in foreign language)

147
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:17,790
- [Jenn] (laughs)

148
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:18,998
- [Dad] (speaks in foreign language)

149
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:19,986
- [Jenn] Oma, model.

150
00:06:19,986 --> 00:06:23,569
(whimsical keyboard music)

151
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:26,802
- Wow!

152
00:06:28,302 --> 00:06:29,161
I love!

153
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:30,119
Thank you so much!

154
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:31,408
- You're welcome.

155
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,991
(whimsical keyboard music)

156
00:06:40,732 --> 00:06:43,126
- [Jenn] Ashley, the boss.

157
00:06:43,126 --> 00:06:45,302
Rev's outfit is on!

158
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:46,135
Oh my gosh!

159
00:06:46,135 --> 00:06:47,539
Looks like a spider.

160
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:51,122
(whimsical keyboard music)

161
00:07:13,006 --> 00:07:14,456
- So amazing!

162
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:17,039
(techno music)

163
00:07:24,103 --> 00:07:27,853
(speaks in foreign language)

164
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:30,130
- [Girl] Hello!

165
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,170
- [Boy] Whenever we had Chinese New Year,

166
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,105
my mom will make it for us.

167
00:07:32,105 --> 00:07:33,328
- Turnip cake?

168
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,165
- We got dumplings.

169
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,160
- Chou em bao.

170
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,327
- Chou em bao!

171
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:38,384
- Mm.

172
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:39,334
- Oh, Ramen.

173
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,167
- Oh, yes please.

174
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,145
- [Boy] Bok choy.

175
00:07:41,145 --> 00:07:42,300
- Vegetables to make us feel better.

176
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,133
- [Boy] Yeah.

177
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,548
- Hello birthday girl!

178
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:45,381
- Hello!

179
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,067
- It is Stephanie's birthday tomorrow.

180
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:49,900
- At midnight tonight.

181
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,188
- At midnight tonight, yeah exactly.

182
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,021
- And everyone's here!

183
00:07:52,021 --> 00:07:53,356
Everyone arrived all at once.

184
00:07:53,356 --> 00:07:54,226
- Uh-huh, promptly.

185
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:56,764
We have a sushi chef.

186
00:07:56,764 --> 00:07:57,597
- Two.

187
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:58,537
- Two.

188
00:07:58,537 --> 00:07:59,370
- Mm-hmm.

189
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,203
- I'm stoked.

190
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:02,285
They already gave us a
little sampler and it was-

191
00:08:02,285 --> 00:08:03,118
- It's already gone.

192
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:03,951
- Pretty good.

193
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,835
- I literally ate it all, it was me.

194
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,166
I had like five pieces.

195
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:07,999
- Oh my God!

196
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,086
- I'm hungry!

197
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:10,903
I've been waiting for this moment since-

198
00:08:10,903 --> 00:08:11,895
- Slow your roll turbo.

199
00:08:11,895 --> 00:08:13,516
I know, actually didn't
eat that much today

200
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:14,441
so I'm ready.

201
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,302
My body is ready.

202
00:08:15,302 --> 00:08:16,432
- Body is ready.

203
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:17,977
- Yeah!

204
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:21,560
(whimsical keyboard music)

205
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,807
♫ Happy birthday to you!

206
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,478
(cheers)

207
00:08:43,748 --> 00:08:45,415
- [Boy] Blow em out!

208
00:08:48,289 --> 00:08:49,622
- Oh!

209
00:08:49,622 --> 00:08:51,039
Shut the fuck up!

210
00:08:52,648 --> 00:08:53,481
[Jenn] Yeah!

211
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,729
(cheers)

212
00:08:54,729 --> 00:08:56,051
- [Girl] What?

213
00:08:56,051 --> 00:08:56,884
Oh my god!

214
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,986
(cheers)

215
00:09:02,223 --> 00:09:04,383
- [Jenn] So, we're having
the Game of Thrones finale

216
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:05,864
party at our house.

217
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:10,253
We got sushi from Steph's
birthday last night.

218
00:09:10,253 --> 00:09:12,621
Got some burgers and veggie burgers,

219
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:13,454
sausages.

220
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:16,767
Got Ben's famous potato salad.

221
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,653
- [Girl] Potato salad. (laughs)

222
00:09:19,653 --> 00:09:22,049
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!

223
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,840
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!

224
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,708
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!

225
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,891
♫ Blow it out, blow it out, make a wish!

226
00:09:29,891 --> 00:09:34,058
[Group] (hums Game of Thrones theme music)

227
00:09:39,717 --> 00:09:43,300
(whimsical keyboard music)

228
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:50,051
- Hello everybody!

229
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:50,974
- Hello!

230
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:52,860
- We are here at Delilah's!

231
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,607
- In the private room, so fancy!

232
00:09:55,607 --> 00:09:56,753
- Private.

233
00:09:56,753 --> 00:09:57,586
Cheers!

234
00:09:57,586 --> 00:09:58,419
- Cheers!

235
00:09:59,621 --> 00:10:01,584
- We're here for a Calpak event.

236
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:03,738
They've invited a selection of girls

237
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:05,106
and we're just here to

238
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,215
just enjoy some food,

239
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:07,845
and look at some new products.

240
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:08,803
- Yeah.

241
00:10:08,803 --> 00:10:10,219
There's some gifts over there

242
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:12,163
that we can see, you can't see it,

243
00:10:12,163 --> 00:10:13,647
but I'm excited to,

244
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:14,480
to open them up!

245
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,563
(laughs)

246
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:20,496
- (laughs)

247
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:22,080
- I'm excited to,

248
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,651
open them up!

249
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:26,254
I was like, what did
you get Dana? (laughs)

250
00:10:26,254 --> 00:10:28,061
- Look at this bountiful feast

251
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:31,273
of ketchup. (laughs)

252
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:33,420
Wait, look how big it is! (laughs)

253
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,175
- [Jenn] It's the size
of your hand! (laughs)

254
00:10:36,175 --> 00:10:37,008
Oh my God!

255
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,994
And, I was thinking about
french fries all day y'all.

256
00:10:39,994 --> 00:10:40,885
- [Stephanie] Yeah, she was.

257
00:10:40,885 --> 00:10:42,411
- [Jenn] I manifested this plate of fries.

258
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:43,476
- [Stephanie] (laughs)

259
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,559
(whimsical DJ music)

260
00:10:48,008 --> 00:10:49,064
- Look who it is!

261
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:50,187
- Hi!

262
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:51,401
- Ingrid!

263
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:54,024
- This is our first time hanging
out and meeting each other.

264
00:10:54,024 --> 00:10:55,143
Which is so crazy!

265
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:56,421
Like, how have we not met before? (laughs)

266
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:57,254
- Seriously!

267
00:10:57,254 --> 00:10:58,087
- I know!

268
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:58,920
- No, but I've been watching you for like,

269
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,086
such a long time.

270
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:01,938
You were one of the first
people I saw on YouTube, so-

271
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,580
- I know! I remember you as like,

272
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,467
one of the people from
like back in the day.

273
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:08,272
One of the first like fashion people

274
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,767
that I was aware of, so-

275
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:10,600
- Wow.

276
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,421
- I know, it's like two
oldies coming together.

277
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,254
- I know, right!

278
00:11:13,254 --> 00:11:14,417
And, she's at my house now, so-

279
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:16,160
- I know, it's so crazy!

280
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,993
- Hey everybody!

281
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:18,826
This is the most recent version of me

282
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:20,863
and, as I was editing this,

283
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,883
I realized that I've done it again.

284
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,165
I ended the vlog super abruptly so,

285
00:11:26,165 --> 00:11:27,633
giving you an outro.

286
00:11:27,633 --> 00:11:29,533
Thank you guys so much for watching.

287
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:31,081
And yes, stating the obvious,

288
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,673
I do have bangs now.

289
00:11:32,673 --> 00:11:35,177
I was getting my hair colored by Anna and,

290
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:36,348
I was just like,

291
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:37,431
"Should I get bangs?"

292
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,264
And she's like,

293
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:40,063
"Yeah, Chaz is right
there, you can ask him."

294
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:42,269
And, it just happened so suddenly,

295
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,937
but I'm so happy with the change.

296
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:46,774
I know whenever like
drastic differences happen

297
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:49,757
people really like to put
in their two cents in.

298
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:52,251
But, I just really, really wanted a change

299
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:54,395
and hair just grows out
at the end of the day.

300
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:56,478
So, if you don't like it,

301
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,212
it's gonna be back to normal
in the next couple of months.

302
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:01,225
So, chill out!

303
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:03,322
I am vlogging all of September.

304
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:04,835
I've already missed a couple days,

305
00:12:04,835 --> 00:12:07,539
but, I think I'm just
gonna do like a, you know,

306
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,433
my monthly compilation as usual.

307
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:11,415
Thank you guys so much for watching,

308
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,618
and, I will see you guys on the next one!

309
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:14,451
Bye!

310
00:12:14,451 --> 00:00:00,000
