00:00:00,661 --> 00:00:03,244
(smooth music)

2
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:09,056
- Hello, everybody!

3
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:13,081
It is December 1st, here
I am in New Orleans.

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,309
I am here for vacation
with my brother and Ben

5
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,793
and I'm so excited to just relax

6
00:00:18,793 --> 00:00:20,544
and spend some time with them.

7
00:00:20,544 --> 00:00:23,258
So, back in September, for
my brother's 30th birthday,

8
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:26,548
I gave him a roundtrip ticket
to anywhere around the U.S.

9
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,327
And we decided to pick New Orleans

10
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:31,297
because we've never been here
and there's just so much of

11
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,638
the United States that
we haven't explored,

12
00:00:33,638 --> 00:00:35,832
so, yeah, we're finally here.

13
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,513
This is our Airbnb.

14
00:00:37,513 --> 00:00:39,456
I will give you guys
a tour in a little bit

15
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:41,414
but right now we're
gonna go grab some dinner

16
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,609
because we're starving.

17
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:45,170
Hopefully we're gonna get some seafood.

18
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,753
(smooth music)

19
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,062
Oh, that's good.

20
00:00:53,443 --> 00:00:56,867
So we are at the oldest
bar in the United States.

21
00:00:56,867 --> 00:00:57,700
- [Ben] Purple.

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,339
- [Jenn] Yeah, I got a purple daiquiri.

23
00:00:59,339 --> 00:01:01,815
- [Ben] We were warned about
this from our Uber driver.

24
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:03,255
- [Jenn] Yeah, he said
that a lot of people

25
00:01:03,255 --> 00:01:05,108
black out from this, so.

26
00:01:05,108 --> 00:01:07,941
- What Jenn got.
- Yeah, of course.

27
00:01:20,454 --> 00:01:22,240
Good morning.

28
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,040
Here is our breakfast.

29
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,422
I've got a veggie omelet.

30
00:01:25,422 --> 00:01:26,255
James got the--

31
00:01:26,255 --> 00:01:28,249
- [All] Chicken and biscuits.

32
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:30,074
- And then Ben.
- Steak and eggs.

33
00:01:30,074 --> 00:01:31,939
- Steak and eggs.
- It is 12:14.

34
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:33,108
This is our first meal of the day.

35
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:35,131
We're absolutely starving.
- Yes.

36
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,244
- And the excitement, I'm hungover.

37
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:41,774
(laughing)
So this is gonna help.

38
00:01:41,774 --> 00:01:44,357

We have a Camembert here, we have a Gouda,

42
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:20,364
which I hear is very good-a.

43
00:02:20,364 --> 00:02:23,439

00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:40,462

51
00:03:08,738 --> 00:03:13,174
Eating a very large salad
for breakfast because

52
00:03:13,174 --> 00:03:17,038
we've been having a really
gnarly weekend of crazy food.

53
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,463
So, gonna throw some health in here.

54
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:21,404
We're at a vegan restaurant called Seed.

55
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:22,786
- It's really good.
- And it's just right across

56
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:27,296
the street from our
Airbnb, so very convenient.

58
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:34,992
- All right, we made it
to the swamp in one piece.

59
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:36,204
That was so convenient.

60
00:03:36,204 --> 00:03:37,066
- It was so easy.

61
00:03:37,066 --> 00:03:38,380
- Real easy.
- Yeah.

62
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,564
They picked us up and now we're here.

63
00:03:39,564 --> 00:03:40,667
- Now we're here by the water.

64
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:42,838
It's very nice, lovely day.
- Mm-hm.

65
00:03:42,838 --> 00:03:44,306
I think this is the beginning of the swamp

66
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:46,978
but it just looks like a really nice dock.

67
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:50,868
There's an airboat that
we will get on later.

68
00:03:50,868 --> 00:03:54,035
(smooth upbeat music)

69
00:04:12,868 --> 00:04:16,103
Good morning, it is our
last day here in New Orleans

70
00:04:16,103 --> 00:04:18,262
and I realized that I didn't
even get to show you guys

71
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:20,263
the Airbnb that we stayed at.

72
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,783
It was lovely, it felt very central.

73
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,847
But yeah, I'll give you guys a little tour

74
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,552
of the space before we head out.

75
00:04:26,552 --> 00:04:29,145
Over here we have a lovely living room.

76
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,325
Over here is the kitchen.

77
00:04:31,325 --> 00:04:34,703
We did not cook at all but
we did eat a lot of chips.

78
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:37,088
We have the room that Ben and I stayed in.

79
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:37,921
- Hey, guys.

80
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,799
- [Jenn] Ben is packing up shop here.

81
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:41,386
- [Ben] Been a lovely time.

82
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:44,201
- And then over here we have James' room.

83
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,576
Hello!
- Hi.

84
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,573
- But yeah, this is the
apartment that we stayed at.

85
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:50,681
It was so wonderful, very
clean and comfortable.

86
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,107
I think we did a really
great choice in the Airbnb

87
00:04:53,107 --> 00:04:55,554
because we were just really happy and

88
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:59,228
every time we got back home,
it really felt like home.

89
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:01,279
We are gonna pack up all our things,

90
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,591
we're gonna go for breakfast.

91
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,889
Unfortunately, I got a little cold.

92
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:07,727
The sniffles are in full force right now.

93
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:08,703
It is not fun.

94
00:05:08,703 --> 00:05:11,703
(smooth jazz music)

95
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,493
All right, we're all
sitting down at the table.

96
00:05:43,493 --> 00:05:44,410
Got Ashley.

97
00:05:45,246 --> 00:05:47,829
(smooth music)

98
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:23,790
Currently on a hike with Cheeki and Ellie.

99
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,083
Looking at the beautiful sunset.

100
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,255
- [Man] For a milestone we're going

101
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:29,922
to reach and meet this year, so.

102
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:33,541
- Hello, everybody, happy Monday.

103
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:36,376
I feel like I have been vlogging a lot but

104
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:38,154
I haven't had a chance just to sit down

105
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:41,533
and explain and process
everything that has happened,

106
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:43,289
so I'm just going to
backtrack a little bit,

107
00:06:43,289 --> 00:06:47,713
talk about my New Orleans trip
because that was incredible.

108
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,377
I loved the fact that I got

109
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:52,014
to travel with my brother and Ben,

110
00:06:52,014 --> 00:06:54,194
two very close male figures in my life

111
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,762
and it was just a freaking amazing trip.

112
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:59,306
Everything felt effortless
and I loved that

113
00:06:59,306 --> 00:07:01,540
we all contributed equally, whether it was

114
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:05,127
getting the Uber or finding
out a cool restaurant or

115
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,191
arranging the swamp tour.

116
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,427
Me and my brother are so
similar and it's crazy,

117
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:14,570
'cause I never thought that
we would be this close.

118
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:19,054
And this relationship
was not always like this.

119
00:07:19,054 --> 00:07:20,172
I don't want to get too into it,

120
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,939
but, basically, when we were younger,

121
00:07:21,939 --> 00:07:23,959
we hung out together every single day,

122
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,283
we were best friends, and
then middle school happened

123
00:07:26,283 --> 00:07:29,991
and then we just stopped
talking until college,

124
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,192
until after I graduated college.

125
00:07:31,192 --> 00:07:34,833
That was a big gap to just not
be speaking with your brother

126
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,940
so I'm glad we're past that phase

127
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,320
and we're at a good terrain now.

128
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,292
It's awesome getting to see Ben
and James just bond as well.

129
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,311
We all just needed some more quality time

130
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:48,080
and New Orleans is such
a freaking great city.

131
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,753
It's so underrated.

132
00:07:49,753 --> 00:07:52,691
The food is amazing, the
people are incredible,

133
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:56,236
and just the architecture
and the community

134
00:07:56,236 --> 00:07:59,653
is just so lighthearted and resilient and

135
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,571
I just really, really love New Orleans.

136
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:06,873
If you haven't checked it out,
I highly recommend you go.

137
00:08:06,873 --> 00:08:11,257
And then we went to the
Refinery29 29 rooms installation.

138
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:14,296
That was such a cool exhibition.

139
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:16,655
Basically, Refinery29 does this every year

140
00:08:16,655 --> 00:08:20,041
but they create 29
different installations.

141
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,812
So, each room signifies
something different.

142
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:24,573
If you love the arts, I highly recommend

143
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:25,879
you guys go check it out.

144
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:28,776
And then, of course, there
was the Unforgettable Gala.

145
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:31,278
This was my second time attending and

146
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:33,115
this experience was completely different,

147
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:35,683
because last year, I was presenting

148
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:38,023
and I was presenting the last award,

149
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:41,587
so I was so nervous
about going on that stage

150
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:43,257
that the entire time I was just like

151
00:08:43,258 --> 00:08:44,973
I was there but I wasn't present

152
00:08:44,973 --> 00:08:48,111
because I was so, like, anxious about,

153
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,699
you know, speaking in front of everybody.

154
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:52,904
So this time around, I was just a guest.

155
00:08:52,904 --> 00:08:54,608
And it was just so inspiring being around

156
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,204
the Asian American community.

157
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:59,444
After that gala, it reminded me that

158
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:02,715
it's beyond just showcasing
your fashion, style, and beauty.

159
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:06,076
This is about visibility and the fact that

160
00:09:06,076 --> 00:09:08,800
growing up as an Asian American woman,

161
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,919
there was nobody that looked
like me in traditional media.

162
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,655
So it only makes sense that growing up

163
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,092
I felt like I couldn't do anything.

164
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:18,788
I felt powerless, I felt like the

165
00:09:18,788 --> 00:09:20,537
great opportunities in entertainment

166
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:23,883
was only for people that
looked a certain type

167
00:09:23,883 --> 00:09:25,432
and I knew that I wasn't it.

168
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,491
And the fact that Asian Americans

169
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:29,235
are pressing the boundaries and

170
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,373
living our passion even though

171
00:09:31,373 --> 00:09:34,649
the traditional Asian parent
tells us to go the safe route,

172
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,372
they tell us to be a doctor
or a lawyer or a scientist

173
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:38,696
or something, or engineer.

174
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:40,720
That's what the traditional path is

175
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,387
and so to be able to

176
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,100
do what I want to do and express the way

177
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,318
I want to express myself is so empowering

178
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,489
and that night was just incredible.

179
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,214
When I woke up today, I
felt pretty overwhelmed

180
00:09:53,214 --> 00:09:55,858
because there were a lot of
things to do on the agenda.

181
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:59,169
The holiday drop for Eggie
is happening next week,

182
00:09:59,169 --> 00:10:02,767
so I have been preparing
for all of this for

183
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:07,280
the entire month, so I'm
just at the final finish line

184
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,716
and then I need to head to the gym

185
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,380
because it's just good for my mind.

186
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,893
I have been going to the
gym pretty regularly but

187
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:15,507
I haven't made it a
habit to bring my camera.

188
00:10:15,507 --> 00:10:17,654
It's because when I'm there, at the gym,

189
00:10:17,654 --> 00:10:19,522
I already don't want to be there

190
00:10:19,522 --> 00:10:21,441
and the last thing I want
to do is, you know, film.

191
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:23,131
But yeah, I've been going to the gym

192
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:25,162
and every time I come back from the gym,

193
00:10:25,162 --> 00:10:27,513
I feel like a new person, so,

194
00:10:27,513 --> 00:10:28,838
it's really for my mental health.

195
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:31,421
(smooth music)

196
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,730
Hello, everybody, happy Tuesday.

197
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,873
Currently in traffic on
the way to the West side.

198
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:45,533
Today is the Eggie holiday lifestyle shoot

199
00:10:45,533 --> 00:10:47,006
and I'm really excited because

200
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:49,119
we got Mel Joy to be the face of it.

201
00:10:49,119 --> 00:10:50,582
I'm so excited.

202
00:10:50,582 --> 00:10:52,299
This shoot is gonna be in Abbot Kinney

203
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:54,483
and so it's gonna be really awesome

204
00:10:54,483 --> 00:10:56,426
and hopefully there's
some festive things that

205
00:10:56,426 --> 00:10:58,082
go along with the collection.

206
00:10:58,082 --> 00:10:59,832
Also, I got my nails done yesterday.

207
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:03,846
They're in this really cool,
rose gold, chrome finish

208
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:05,139
and I really love it.

209
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,031
Normally I don't go for stuff like this,

210
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:11,187
I just kind of go with something natural

211
00:11:11,187 --> 00:11:13,187
or just basic because I,

212
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,130
I don't know, I just want
my nails to look polished,

213
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,952
but I don't really care about designs,

214
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:20,092
but since it's the holiday season,

215
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,519
I thought I would splurge a little

216
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,377
and get something a little special.

217
00:11:23,377 --> 00:11:26,466
All right, we are shooting
Eggie Holiday Three Collection.

218
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:28,663
We've got Mel's outfits over here.

219
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:32,224
She's got kind of more of like
a street style fashion vibe,

220
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:35,723
so everything's casual
and there's pops of color.

221
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:38,692
- This is such good quality.
- Thank you, yeah.

222
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:41,297
- What is this?
- So this is the Canon T3i,

223
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,373
I threw on a wide-angle lense,

224
00:11:43,373 --> 00:11:44,632
but yeah.
- This is great.

225
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:45,690
- Thank you.
- Hi, everyone.

226
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,217
- Yeah, this is Mel.

227
00:11:47,217 --> 00:11:50,203
- We're here in LA, about to film.

228
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:52,107
I'm so excited, the clothes are so cute,

229
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:53,141
make sure to check them out.

230
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,017
- Thank you.
- They're so adorable.

231
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:56,525
- Yeah, she's wearing the
lateshift trouser here,

232
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,553
it looks so sick.
- I love this.

233
00:11:58,553 --> 00:12:01,171
- So she's gonna be the face
of Holiday Three Collection

234
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:04,958
and she's from the Bay Area.
- Yeah, Bay represent!

235
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,442
- Hi, Mochi Bear.

236
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:09,274
I never showed this to
you guys, but I bought,

237
00:12:09,274 --> 00:12:10,615
oh, you can see me through the screen.

238
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:13,508
But I bought the Nintendo Switch

239
00:12:13,508 --> 00:12:16,299
and it was supposed to be for me and Ben,

240
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:19,904
but it turns out I'm the
only person playing it.

241
00:12:19,904 --> 00:12:22,993
Also, because I'm hogging
it most of the time

242
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:25,119
because I'm playing this game.

243
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,369
It's called Stardew Valley.

244
00:12:28,575 --> 00:12:32,451
This is my little farm and
it's kind of like FarmVille

245
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:33,618
but way better

246
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:37,539
and there's just a lot
more things you can do.

247
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:40,151
So right now I am on my second spring

248
00:12:40,151 --> 00:12:41,595
and these are all my crops.

249
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:44,931
I've watered all of
them and I got my horse.

250
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,393
If you don't have a horse,
you gotta get on that

251
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:48,841
because it's freaking amazing.

252
00:12:48,841 --> 00:12:50,899
You get to go around
the town so much faster.

253
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:52,317
There's my dog.

254
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,971
My dog's name is Chippo
in this game as well.

255
00:12:54,971 --> 00:12:58,551
But basically, this is my
little world that I go into

256
00:12:58,551 --> 00:13:02,689
because sometimes when I
just want to take a break,

257
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:04,883
it's hard for me to relax and watch

258
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:08,129
YouTube or go on Instagram
because sometimes

259
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:10,990
it just feels like
work, so, when I come on

260
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,082
this lovely farm, it's
like my own little escape

261
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:17,999
and it's very, very, very relaxing.

262
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:26,083
A little guide for more comfort
and joy by Courtney Carver.

263
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,743
When I think about all the times

264
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:29,710
I was wrapped up in the pursuit of more,

265
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,275
it's clear that I really did want more.

266
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,941
I just finished reading for a podcast

267
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:36,946
called Optimal Living Daily.

268
00:13:36,946 --> 00:13:40,212
It is one of my favorite
productivity podcasts.

269
00:13:40,212 --> 00:13:42,446
So, every day, the host, Justin Malik,

270
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,863
he reads out blog posts about

271
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:49,172
minimalism and productivity and

272
00:13:49,172 --> 00:13:53,020
Amy reached out and
asked me, or asked him,

273
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,875
if we could both read for his podcast

274
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,289
'cause it's always been a dream of mine

275
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:59,754
and now it happened,
so, I'm really excited.

276
00:13:59,754 --> 00:14:02,470
I will definitely let you know when that,

277
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,306
or when my episode comes out,

278
00:14:04,306 --> 00:14:06,067
I'll blasting it on my social media

279
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:08,112
'cause I'm really excited about this.

280
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:12,264
So Ben just made some cod,
is that what this fish is?

281
00:14:12,264 --> 00:14:13,277
- [Ben] Yeah.

282
00:14:13,277 --> 00:14:17,459
- [Jenn] Some cod, green beans,
and some roasted potatoes.

283
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,134
I've got some wine and the
Great British Bake Off.

284
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,717
(smooth music)

285
00:14:29,446 --> 00:14:33,613
All right, for dinner tonight,
Ben is making veggie burgers.

286
00:14:34,453 --> 00:14:35,886
Yum!

287
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:39,009
- We've got enough in
the fridge but we just

288
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,449
thought we'll go for a
nice, simple veggie burger.

289
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:44,868
Gonna get some sweet corn,
some tomato, some onion.

290
00:14:44,868 --> 00:14:47,649
- [Jenn] Oh, and, yes,
red onion, my favorite.

291
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:48,640
- Got some raw as well.
- I know.

292
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,146
- [Ben] So that your breath is lovely.

293
00:14:50,146 --> 00:14:52,933
- [Jenn] I know, well I'm only
smooching one person tonight.

294
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,043
- That's true, then I'll be
stinking of onion too, so.

295
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:57,160
(laughing)
Together.

296
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,500
- [Jenn] Also, I didn't
get to vlog this but

297
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,749
Ben and I spent last week decorating

298
00:15:02,749 --> 00:15:04,767
the inside of our home.

299
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,340
It looks fairly festive.

300
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,173
- [Ben] Festive enough.

301
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:09,657
- Festive enough, yeah.
- There needs to be more.

302
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:13,466
- [Jenn] I wrapped this
lovely tinsel garland

303
00:15:13,466 --> 00:15:15,426
all across the stairs.

304
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:18,887
I feel like it has a really
nice holiday element to it.

305
00:15:18,887 --> 00:15:22,000
And lastly we have our
festive Christmas tree.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,909
We got this at Home Depot
and, yes, it is fake--

307
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:27,590
- [Ben] Get over with it.

308
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,127
- I mean, I've always had
a fake Christmas tree.

309
00:15:30,127 --> 00:15:32,774
Tomorrow is actually a really huge day.

310
00:15:32,774 --> 00:15:35,539
We are shooting the Eggie Holiday Lookbook

311
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:37,417
and it's gonna be with LR Creative,

312
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:40,765
so I'm really excited to
be teaming with them again

313
00:15:40,765 --> 00:15:44,348
because I feel like
they are such creatives

314
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:48,594
and I love that we're all not
afraid to try something new,

315
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:52,897
so this one's gonna be
pretty interesting and fun.

316
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:55,440
Oh, wow, where do I get started?

317
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,791
Is this my red onion?

318
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,469
- [Ben] Well, you
shouldn't have all of it,

319
00:15:58,469 --> 00:15:59,687
so I was just gonna
have whatever you don't.

320
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:00,520
- Oh.

321
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,378
I would eat all this red onion, though.

322
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,840
- Once when me and Jenn were first dating,

323
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,337
she sent me a photo of a
burger or sandwich she made.

324
00:16:07,337 --> 00:16:08,870
- Yeah.
- And there was literally half

325
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,531
a block of red onion in there.

326
00:16:10,531 --> 00:16:13,314
- And then I took a bite into
it and I was like, "God."

327
00:16:13,314 --> 00:16:16,907
Good morning, everybody,
it is Thursday at 11 a.m.

328
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:20,604
Today we are shooting the
Eggie Holiday Lookbook.

329
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,437
I'm with my crew from LR Creative.

330
00:16:24,356 --> 00:16:27,382
It's gonna be a dance party,
it's gonna be real, real fun.

331
00:16:27,382 --> 00:16:30,004
We've got a hazer here.

332
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:32,827
Vu, can you walk us through this machine?

333
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,259
- So, it's, like, a fog machine.

334
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,753
It basically it is, but
it uses different liquid.

335
00:16:36,753 --> 00:16:38,874
So it creates more of a atmosphere

336
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,837
versus, like, just a thick cloud of smoke.

337
00:16:40,837 --> 00:16:42,052
- [Jenn] Oh.

338
00:16:42,052 --> 00:16:44,635
(smooth music)

339
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:52,226
- So, basically, fire
alarm all the way up there.

340
00:16:52,226 --> 00:16:55,085
We need to turn it off because
we've got a haze machine.

341
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:59,094
Somehow, we need to try and reach it, so,

342
00:16:59,094 --> 00:17:02,746
we're getting pillows, plus Trevor,

343
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:06,567
plus me on top, and we're
gonna try and get it.

344
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,019
And, first of all,
health and safety people,

345
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:10,320
look, I know, we'll put it back in,

346
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,051
everything's fine, it's just a hazer.

347
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,426
No fires are going on.

348
00:17:14,426 --> 00:17:16,865
This is my crash landing.

349
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,773
- You can step on my
back, just don't kill me.

350
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:19,606
- [Ben] Okay.

351
00:17:19,607 --> 00:17:22,107
(light music)

352
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:28,990
Yay.

353
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,073
- [Jenn] Yes.

354
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,533
- This is like one of the most luxurious.

355
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,783
(laughing)

356
00:17:37,297 --> 00:17:38,451
It's high on the new thing.

357
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:39,437
On the camera, that's not that high.

358
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:41,654
It takes Trevor plus me plus Vu.

359
00:17:41,654 --> 00:17:44,894
- How tall are you, Trevor?
- I'm like 6'4.

360
00:17:44,894 --> 00:17:46,811
- And I'm not.
- I was--

361
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:49,658
- How about this?

362
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:50,491
Just behind her like this?

363
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,324
How about just like this?

364
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:53,965
I'll do the thing.
- This okay?

365
00:17:53,965 --> 00:17:56,382
(vocalizing)

366
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:03,213
(laughing)

367
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:04,088
- [Ben] What is that?

368
00:18:04,088 --> 00:18:05,277
- [Jenn] This is Ben's laser.

369
00:18:05,277 --> 00:18:07,867
These are Trevor's lasers.

370
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,700
Oh my god.
- Oh my god.

371
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,123
- It's crazy.

372
00:18:13,123 --> 00:18:13,956
Whoa.

373
00:18:15,874 --> 00:18:17,124
Oh my goodness.

374
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:21,848
The shoot is finally over and
it couldn't have gone better.

375
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:24,390
It was incredible and I'm stoked.

376
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:27,903
It also involves a lot
of dancing and, honestly,

377
00:18:27,903 --> 00:18:30,652
if someone had brought
this video idea up to me,

378
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:33,116
like, a year ago, I would've been like,

379
00:18:33,116 --> 00:18:37,047
"No, absolutely not, I'm
not doing that," but,

380
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,982
this year is the year
where I am testing myself

381
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:42,816
and I want to get out of
my comfort zone because

382
00:18:42,816 --> 00:18:44,023
you can't get out of your comfort zone

383
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,567
if you don't actually
go out of it, I mean.

384
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,183
But yeah, this video's
gonna be really fun.

385
00:18:49,183 --> 00:18:50,611
I just want to make a disclaimer that

386
00:18:50,611 --> 00:18:53,498
this video is not meant
to be taken seriously.

387
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:57,350
It's supposed to be lighthearted
and just a good time.

388
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,011
It's meant to showcase
that you can have a party

389
00:19:00,011 --> 00:19:02,508
wherever you are, including your home.

390
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,621
So yeah, I hope you guys enjoy it.

391
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:07,490
Anyway, I am gonna get freshened up

392
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,089
because Ben and I are going
to Sophie and Si's place.

393
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,228
They're having us over for,

394
00:19:12,228 --> 00:19:14,655
just, like, dinner and some games.

395
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,029
A lot of people are leaving
for the holiday season, so,

396
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:19,727
this is just our last hurrah
before everybody dissipates.

397
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:21,642
So, yeah, it's gonna be great.

398
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:24,008
I am Sophie and Si's place.

399
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:27,857
Look at their beautiful
charcuterie spread.

400
00:19:27,857 --> 00:19:29,367
I love this.

401
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:30,284
Hi, Weylie.

402
00:19:31,685 --> 00:19:33,177
(laughing)

403
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,431
Okay, who goes first?

404
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:37,389
- I will go first.
- Oldest person goes first.

405
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:38,839
- [Jenn] Oldest person.

406
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:41,422
- I have wings but I can't fly.

407
00:19:42,745 --> 00:19:46,877
There are more of me
than any other bird on--

408
00:19:46,877 --> 00:19:48,289
- [Jenn] Chicken!

409
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,122
- Yes.

410
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:49,955
- Yay!

411
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,433
- Boo!

412
00:19:54,433 --> 00:19:58,894
(upbeat music)
(overlapping chatter)

413
00:19:58,894 --> 00:20:00,119
- [Woman] Freeway, highway!

414
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,952
- Yeah.

415
00:20:02,714 --> 00:20:05,081
Hello, everybody, it is Friday.

416
00:20:05,081 --> 00:20:06,334
So, yeah, I guess that wraps up

417
00:20:06,334 --> 00:20:08,641
the first episode of Jennglebells.

418
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,763
I shall continue vlogging
for the rest of the month

419
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:14,732
and I'll see you guys in the next one.

420
00:20:14,732 --> 00:20:15,978
Bye!

421
00:20:15,978 --> 00:00:00,000
(smooth music)
