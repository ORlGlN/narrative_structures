1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,583
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:09,952 --> 00:00:11,320
- Hey everybody, it's your girl Jenn,

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,416
and today I'll be showing you

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:15,130
how I did this yellow eyeshadow look.

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,784
This has been highly requested
and very long awaited,

6
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,124
so thank you so much for your patience.

7
00:00:20,124 --> 00:00:22,308
Last month was really, really crazy.

8
00:00:22,308 --> 00:00:24,594
I finally had a moment to just sit down,

9
00:00:24,594 --> 00:00:26,778
and just chat and show
you guys how I did this.

10
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:28,186
Since it's back-to-school season,

11
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:30,245
I thought I would just
grab a bunch of questions

12
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,965
about college on my Instagram,

13
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:33,294
and you know, chat about it,

14
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:35,224
because this is a really exciting,

15
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:36,864
but also scary time for a lot of you.

16
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,665
So I thought I would put my two cents in,

17
00:00:38,665 --> 00:00:40,723
and also show you how I did this.

18
00:00:40,723 --> 00:00:42,003
So let's get started!

19
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,836
I am gonna hydrate my lips first,

20
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:48,649
by using Glossier's Mint Balm
Dotcom universal skin salve.

21
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,322
I've used all their formulas,

22
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:53,489
but the mint one is by far my favorite.

23
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,636
It has like, this nice cooling sensation,

24
00:00:56,636 --> 00:00:58,881
similar to Burt's Bees.

25
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:00,684
But the packaging is just so much cuter.

26
00:01:00,684 --> 00:01:01,970
Now I'm gonna move on to primer.

27
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,641
I'm using this one by Too Faced.

28
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,745
It is their Hangover Rx.

29
00:01:05,745 --> 00:01:08,842
And this one is probably one
of the most nourishing primers

30
00:01:08,842 --> 00:01:10,070
that I've ever used.

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,160
Before, I was just really on the ball

32
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,315
with anything that was like, mattifying

33
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:16,629
and stuff that didn't make me oily,

34
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:17,693
but these days,

35
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:20,185
I've just been enjoying
like, a nice dewy look.

36
00:01:20,185 --> 00:01:22,870
It just looks youthful and in Korea,

37
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,726
you know they like that dewy face,

38
00:01:24,726 --> 00:01:27,766
so that's just the card
I've been playing. (laughs)

39
00:01:27,766 --> 00:01:31,066
Ah, okay so primer is finished.

40
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:34,246
Now I am just gonna skip
foundation completely,

41
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:36,402
and I'm just gonna go
directly to concealer.

42
00:01:36,402 --> 00:01:38,514
I'm using this concealer,
this is by Hourglass.

43
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:40,320
And it is a stick.

44
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,114
And I'm just going to put
it underneath my eyes.

45
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,864
Right over here, wow.

46
00:01:47,838 --> 00:01:50,973
And then I put it around my nose.

47
00:01:50,973 --> 00:01:53,235
A little on my forehead.

48
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,902
And then on my chin.

49
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:58,403
So basically, all the
dark areas of my face.

50
00:01:58,403 --> 00:01:59,549
And while I'm blending,

51
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:01,640
I might as well get
cracking with the questions.

52
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,607
(laughs) I've just been
getting carried away

53
00:02:02,607 --> 00:02:03,999
with the makeup.

54
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,686
So this is from korleyan.

55
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:09,478
"How was community college
compared to a university?

56
00:02:09,478 --> 00:02:12,321
"And if any differences or
similarities between the two?

57
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:13,154
"Love you!"

58
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:17,106
First off, community college
kind of feels like high school,

59
00:02:17,106 --> 00:02:18,174
the sequel. (laughs)

60
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:20,592
You're gonna know a lot of
people there from your school,

61
00:02:20,592 --> 00:02:22,514
but there's also a new flush of people.

62
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:23,660
Honestly, looking back,

63
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,114
I'm so happy that I went
to community college,

64
00:02:26,114 --> 00:02:29,154
because just the amount of
money I saved from tuition

65
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,614
is just, like, unbelievable.

66
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:33,309
I was able to just take my time,

67
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,681
and figure out what I wanted to do.

68
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,082
I was not the best student growing up.

69
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:40,870
I was always just a very average student,

70
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,942
and in the eyes of, you
know, a Korean family,

71
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:47,024
if it wasn't straight A's,
it wasn't good enough.

72
00:02:47,024 --> 00:02:50,252
And I definitely never,
ever got straight A's.

73
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:53,758
I think I was really in my head
when I was going to school.

74
00:02:53,758 --> 00:02:57,466
I was just so focused on
trying to get the good grade

75
00:02:57,466 --> 00:02:58,721
and memorizing everything,

76
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:02,458
that that anxiety and that
pressure actually crippled me,

77
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,838
and once I stopped caring
about what grade I got,

78
00:03:04,838 --> 00:03:06,529
that's when I started
getting good grades. (laughs)

79
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,219
That was my senior year of college.

80
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:09,408
Because I went to community college,

81
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:12,063
I was able to really figure
out what I wanted to do.

82
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:14,044
Obviously, math was not an option for me.

83
00:03:14,044 --> 00:03:16,351
I do not understand how to crunch numbers.

84
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:18,452
Writing, I was horrible at.

85
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:20,391
Science, a mystery! (laughs)

86
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:22,249
And I finally went to my
counselor, and I was like,

87
00:03:22,249 --> 00:03:24,251
I really don't know what I wanna do.

88
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,571
And she said, well what do you like doing?

89
00:03:26,571 --> 00:03:28,545
And I told her that I liked going out,

90
00:03:28,545 --> 00:03:30,680
I liked meeting people,
I liked socializing,

91
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,881
and she told me of this
major called Communications!

92
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,745
But I was able to take
all the units I needed

93
00:03:35,745 --> 00:03:37,799
to be able to transfer.

94
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,966
And once I did transfer, it
was just a whole new world.

95
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:46,163
I never lived away from home before,

96
00:03:46,163 --> 00:03:50,080
so I got accepted to UC
Davis and UC San Diego.

97
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:53,081
And I was pretty torn,

98
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:56,568
because as much as I wanted
to go to UC San Diego,

99
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:59,051
I wanted to just get the hell
out of southern California.

100
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,034
I was over it.

101
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,681
I wanted to just start completely fresh,

102
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:05,948
and just be the new
girl at school for once,

103
00:04:05,948 --> 00:04:09,249
because growing up, my parents
never moved, which is great,

104
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,469
because I never had to
feel displaced or anything,

105
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,257
but you know, when you watch those movies,

106
00:04:14,257 --> 00:04:15,926
and it always starts off with like,

107
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:17,612
ah, the new kid at school.

108
00:04:17,612 --> 00:04:18,649
Who is she?

109
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:19,486
So I don't know,

110
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:21,598
I just wanted to basically
get out of my hometown

111
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:23,177
and just start completely fresh.

112
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:25,005
And San Diego is only two hours away,

113
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:26,503
but I wanted to be far.

114
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:29,070
I wanted people to have
to go on a road trip

115
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,995
or a plane to go see me. (laughs)

116
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:32,525
If I had to say a difference,

117
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:34,521
whether like the classes were better

118
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,459
or the professors were
better at community college

119
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,644
or UC Davis, I would say
it's pretty comparable.

120
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,314
I mean, it's really what you make of it.

121
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:44,671
You can go to the best Ivy League school,

122
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:46,189
but if you're not there to absorb,

123
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:47,996
then there's really no point.

124
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,332
And I also would like to say
that what school you go to

125
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,255
does not define you at all.

126
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:55,295
Maybe I'll do another layer. (laughs)

127
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,695
It's so funny, the day I'm like,

128
00:04:56,695 --> 00:04:58,010
I'm not gonna wear foundation,

129
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,846
I'm like, it's not covered enough.

130
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:03,013
Alright guys, I think that is blended.

131
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:05,745
I'm just like punching myself

132
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,224
with this beauty blender. (laughs)

133
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,293
So the concealer is all blended out.

134
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:11,320
And now I'm gonna seal that with a powder.

135
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,758
I'm going back to an old favorite of mine.

136
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:17,241
This is the Rimmel Stay Matte Powder.

137
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,583
Look how old this is.

138
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,108
I should have probably gotten a new one,

139
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,741
but you know, this will do.

140
00:05:22,741 --> 00:05:25,508
I'm gonna grab this flat
brush by Marc Jacobs,

141
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:29,628
and I'm just gonna scrape
what is left of this guy,

142
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,160
and I'm going to put it underneath my eyes

143
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,029
just to set everything.

144
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:36,219
As you can see, I'm grabbing this,

145
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:38,562
and I'm just literally patting it,

146
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,401
no swirling, just patting,

147
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,760
because I don't wanna ruin

148
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,213
the good thing we've got going down here.

149
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,978
So now that powder is done,
I'm gonna move onto the brows.

150
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,712
Here I'm using two products.

151
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,874
First I'm gonna use Dior's Brow Styler.

152
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,677
I've mentioned this a
million times before,

153
00:05:54,677 --> 00:05:58,287
but this is just a great pencil
for the meat of my brows.

154
00:05:58,287 --> 00:05:59,979
It's like a nice color shade.

155
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,162
And then for the tails,

156
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:03,683
I go in with Benefit's
Goof Proof Brow Pencil.

157
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:07,420
This is a darker color, so it
just really defines the tails.

158
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,409
I like my tails to be the
darkest part of the brow.

159
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:11,235
"How did it feel when
you moved to UC Davis

160
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,447
"as a transfer student?

161
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:14,094
"Did you have trouble making good friends

162
00:06:14,094 --> 00:06:15,840
"since people already knew each other?

163
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,265
"Did you feel left out at all?

164
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,694
"Did you join any clubs?

165
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:20,936
"I'm transferring from a
community college next year,

166
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,474
"so I'm super nervous about that.

167
00:06:22,474 --> 00:06:23,307
"Thank you!"

168
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:25,865
Being a transfer student
was definitely really hard,

169
00:06:25,865 --> 00:06:28,933
because yeah, everybody
already has their friends.

170
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:31,624
They have their established
cliques already,

171
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,585
and going in as a transfer student,

172
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:35,926
I was starting completely from scratch.

173
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:38,388
And I made sure to use the internet

174
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:40,788
(laughs) to help me find some friends.

175
00:06:40,788 --> 00:06:43,481
So when I was trying to find housing,

176
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,065
I found this Facebook group,

177
00:06:45,065 --> 00:06:47,573
where it was just for UC Davis transfers

178
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,205
and people who were
looking for housemates,

179
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:52,986
and I made sure that my profile
was as detailed as possible.

180
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,613
I said where I was from,
what my interests were,

181
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:58,452
I wrote all my favorite
bands, all my favorite books,

182
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,420
all my favorite films,
and using that profile,

183
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,975
I was able to find someone
that I really clicked with.

184
00:07:04,975 --> 00:07:06,490
And she was going to be my housemate.

185
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,350
She had the same interests as me,

186
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,294
and so it wasn't a huge surprise
when we actually got along.

187
00:07:12,294 --> 00:07:13,611
So she was my first friend,

188
00:07:13,611 --> 00:07:16,973
and she was the person that I
spent my 21st birthday with,

189
00:07:16,973 --> 00:07:18,205
and if you're watching this So,

190
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:19,929
I love you, thinking about you.

191
00:07:19,929 --> 00:07:22,454
I feel like social media
gets like, a really bad rap.

192
00:07:22,454 --> 00:07:25,210
But it actually helps in the end,

193
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,583
if you utilize it correctly.

194
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:29,270
Personally, I didn't join any clubs.

195
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,187
I just spent any extra
time filming or editing,

196
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:36,752
I was just always consumed by my studies

197
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:39,074
or my YouTube channel, and in a sense,

198
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,809
it was good, because I
became very independent.

199
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,211
I just had to entertain myself (laughs),

200
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:46,591
so whether it was like, going
to the movie theater by myself

201
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,527
or going to the thrift store by myself,

202
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:51,386
I was always keeping myself preoccupied.

203
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:52,632
But if I could go back in time,

204
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:53,968
I definitely would've
joined at least like,

205
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:55,065
one club or something,

206
00:07:55,065 --> 00:07:58,055
because I know a lot of
my friends that have been

207
00:07:58,055 --> 00:08:01,177
in organizations and clubs and sororities,

208
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:04,863
where they have and left
with lifelong friends,

209
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,300
and it would've been really awesome.

210
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,491
So I think if you are
looking for a community,

211
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:10,596
I would definitely recommend
you joining a club,

212
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,591
because there are good people in there.

213
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,757
So now that the brows are done,

214
00:08:13,757 --> 00:08:17,035
let's move onto the fun
part, the eye shadow.

215
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:21,035
So I am gonna use Nars'
Radiant Creamy Concealer

216
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,439
as like a primer for my lids.

217
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,071
So I'm just gonna pat
this all over the lid,

218
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:29,348
and this is just gonna
really enhance the colors

219
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,455
of the eyeshadows.

220
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:34,126
I literally just
discovered that this works,

221
00:08:34,126 --> 00:08:37,390
so I'm very excited to implement
this into my tutorials.

222
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,320
So once that's all blended out,

223
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:43,791
I'm gonna grab my yellow
eyeshadow from 3 Concept Eyes.

224
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,423
This is called Yolk,
which is the perfect name.

225
00:08:46,423 --> 00:08:49,469
So it's a very yellow eyeshadow.

226
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:53,018
I'm gonna grab this flat
brush, this is by e.l.f.

227
00:08:53,018 --> 00:08:55,586
Doesn't have a number, but
it just looks like this.

228
00:08:55,586 --> 00:08:58,017
Yeah, so as you can see,
I'm not swooping it,

229
00:08:58,017 --> 00:09:00,125
or else that would
cause too much fall out.

230
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,643
I'm literally just petting it.

231
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,946
I think maybe the reason
why I didn't join any clubs

232
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:08,167
was that it was hard to
find time in my schedule,

233
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,424
because a lot of the clubs,

234
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:12,227
you had to stay at school
even longer than you had to,

235
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:15,623
and I was always ready to
bounce out after my class,

236
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:18,404
so maybe that's why I didn't join any.

237
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:21,096
And then once you get a little closer to,

238
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:22,387
I guess, the outsides,

239
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:26,023
that's when I'm able to kind
of swoop it around like that.

240
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,554
So now that the yellow is on,

241
00:09:27,554 --> 00:09:30,186
I'm gonna use this
pallette from ColourPop.

242
00:09:30,186 --> 00:09:32,198
Unfortunately, I don't know the name,

243
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:35,173
but it's got this nice orange shade in it.

244
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:36,339
And then with the flat brush,

245
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:40,726
I'm just gonna put it
all over the under eyes.

246
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:42,426
I can't forget about the inner corners,

247
00:09:42,426 --> 00:09:46,576
so I'm gonna use this
lighter shade over here.

248
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,704
I'm gonna pop that on my brow bone

249
00:09:48,704 --> 00:09:51,919
and also the inner corners of my eyes.

250
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,987
The power of a shimmer
in the inner corners,

251
00:09:53,987 --> 00:09:55,685
it just brightens everything up.

252
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:58,752
There is one final
element to the eyeshadow.

253
00:09:58,752 --> 00:10:01,995
I'm using ColourPop's Flipper.

254
00:10:01,995 --> 00:10:03,116
It looks really orange,

255
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:06,264
but it's actually just a
really nice warm shimmer.

256
00:10:06,264 --> 00:10:10,098
I'm gonna grab my ring finger,
swoop it around like that,

257
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:13,920
and then I'm just going to
simply pat it all over the lid.

258
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,412
And this is just gonna
make the yellow glittery,

259
00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,724
and I know some people don't like shimmer,

260
00:10:19,724 --> 00:10:22,963
but I'm all about that
shimmer, glitter life.

261
00:10:22,963 --> 00:10:24,304
So now that the eyeshadow's finished,

262
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:26,553
I'm gonna move onto the eyeliner.

263
00:10:26,553 --> 00:10:28,507
I'm using Kat Von D's Tattoo Liner.

264
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,775
I literally use this all the time.

265
00:10:30,775 --> 00:10:34,426
I have yet to find eyeliner
that is very similar to this.

266
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,126
I just like the pen.

267
00:10:36,126 --> 00:10:37,533
I thought it was felt tip, but it's not.

268
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,842
It's actually a brush,

269
00:10:38,842 --> 00:10:42,819
and the way it just goes on
is just so smooth for me.

270
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:44,371
So now I'm gonna move on to the lashes.

271
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,476
I'm gonna give it a nice little squeeze,

272
00:10:47,476 --> 00:10:50,358
and then I'm gonna go in
with my usual lash primer,

273
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,301
which is Lancome's Cils Booster.

274
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:55,408
This is from carleemats.

275
00:10:55,408 --> 00:10:56,837
"As a part of the college experience,

276
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:58,683
"we all have to interact with new people.

277
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,969
"It's easy to start a conversation
with a simple, 'hello,'

278
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:02,638
"but how do you continue one?

279
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,086
"By the way, I love you and your videos.

280
00:11:04,086 --> 00:11:05,283
"You're such an inspiration."

281
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:06,487
Thank you Carlee.

282
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:07,839
Making conversation with people,

283
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,927
whether you're in college
or outside college

284
00:11:09,927 --> 00:11:12,352
is really tricky and nerveracking,

285
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:14,523
but it's just something that you gotta do,

286
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:16,131
you gotta put yourself out there.

287
00:11:16,131 --> 00:11:18,282
It is scary and terrifying,

288
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:21,491
and there have definitely been
times where I've tried to,

289
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,215
like, try to be friends with someone,

290
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,986
and just be completely shut off,

291
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:27,019
but you know what, that is
the nature of the world.

292
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,084
You're gonna get hurt,

293
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:30,823
but what doesn't kill
you makes you stronger.

294
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:33,261
I would say, you should
try and find something

295
00:11:33,261 --> 00:11:35,982
that you're genuinely interested
in about the other person,

296
00:11:35,982 --> 00:11:38,398
so whether it's their
shirt that you noticed,

297
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,035
or the book that they're reading,

298
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:42,244
or what they did that weekend,

299
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:44,493
just try and find some common ground.

300
00:11:44,493 --> 00:11:45,790
And then start tackling them

301
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,963
with the who, what, where, why, and how's.

302
00:11:48,963 --> 00:11:50,135
If you wanna make friends,

303
00:11:50,135 --> 00:11:52,526
you have to genuinely
be interested in them.

304
00:11:52,526 --> 00:11:54,558
That's the only way you're
gonna be able to do it.

305
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,903
Instead of selling yourself,
be interested in that person.

306
00:11:57,903 --> 00:11:59,634
It's like the Dale Carnegie quote.

307
00:11:59,634 --> 00:12:02,142
He said, "You can make
more friends in two months

308
00:12:02,142 --> 00:12:04,449
"by becoming interested in other people,

309
00:12:04,449 --> 00:12:06,037
"than you can in two years

310
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:08,484
"by trying to get other
people interested in you."

311
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,356
So ask where they're from,
what their hometown was like,

312
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:12,431
what kind of friends they have,

313
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:14,354
what they enjoy doing on the weekends,

314
00:12:14,354 --> 00:12:15,802
what kind of food they like,

315
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,138
what kind of books they like to read,

316
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:18,691
what they like about the outdoors.

317
00:12:18,691 --> 00:12:20,889
Just literally anything.

318
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,291
And I know asking questions
seems like, so nerveracking,

319
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:25,912
like, what do I even ask the other person?

320
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,777
Just literally ask them anything.

321
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:29,664
That's how you get started.

322
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:32,309
People are like onions, and
the more questions you ask,

323
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:33,842
the more that you peel them open.

324
00:12:33,842 --> 00:12:35,034
It's like the Shrek movie!

325
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:37,182
People are like onions,
it's what Donkey said.

326
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:39,025
(laughs) And that just
really resonated with me.

327
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,194
And some people are harder
to peel than others,

328
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,907
but once you have that outer layer down,

329
00:12:43,907 --> 00:12:45,284
then you've made a friend.

330
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,433
There have been many times

331
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,378
where I've tried to make conversation

332
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:49,987
with just random people in the street,

333
00:12:49,987 --> 00:12:52,512
and it did not go very successfully.

334
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:55,640
I was at the usual cafe
that I normally studied at,

335
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,855
Delta of Venus, and I saw this girl

336
00:12:57,855 --> 00:13:00,409
just sitting on the table,
and she looked really cool

337
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:02,293
and interesting, and I
really liked her outfit,

338
00:13:02,293 --> 00:13:05,851
and I went up to her, and I
tried to make a conversation.

339
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:06,838
I forgot what I said,

340
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:09,577
but literally after
like, the third question,

341
00:13:09,577 --> 00:13:12,410
she just stood up and walked away.

342
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:17,015
And I remember feeling so freaking small,

343
00:13:18,138 --> 00:13:19,509
and so stupid.

344
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,548
And that kind of made me not
want to talk to other people.

345
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:23,444
I was like, you know what, (bleep) it.

346
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,504
Like, if they don't wanna be my friend,

347
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,448
like I don't wanna be other
people's friend either.

348
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:29,578
But being alone only takes you so far,

349
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:31,375
and obviously, the
loneliness just got to me,

350
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,470
and I had to just put
myself out there again.

351
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,926
And not everyone is gonna be like that.

352
00:13:35,926 --> 00:13:38,132
Not everyone is gonna be a dick.

353
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:39,902
Not everyone is gonna
be super nice to you,

354
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,758
but the point is you gotta keep on trying.

355
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,603
Once you find a good egg,
once you find a good person,

356
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:49,528
just stick with them and
treat them with respect,

357
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:51,565
ask them everything about them,

358
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,527
and I don't think it's weird,

359
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:55,080
like looking at their social media.

360
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,235
All the people in my life,

361
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,151
I genuinely wanna know what they're up to,

362
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,226
so I'm always stalking them
on their Insta Stories,

363
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:01,502
their Instagram, their Facebook.

364
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:02,747
I wanna know what they're up to.

365
00:14:02,747 --> 00:14:06,999
Use social media to kind
of prepare the questions.

366
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:11,597
So if you saw, I don't
know, a classmate going to,

367
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:14,400
I don't know, go on a hike or something,

368
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,677
ask them, oh my gosh,
like how was that hike?

369
00:14:16,677 --> 00:14:18,021
How many miles did you walk?

370
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:19,087
What kind of trail was it?

371
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:19,920
Do you enjoy hiking?

372
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,822
Do you like nature?

373
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:23,818
Like (laughs) it all kind of flows.

374
00:14:23,818 --> 00:14:27,131
I think it's all about just
starting the questions,

375
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,424
and then getting used to that,

376
00:14:28,424 --> 00:14:30,951
and just being genuinely
interested in other people.

377
00:14:30,951 --> 00:14:32,830
And then they'll be interested in you.

378
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,008
Hey wow, that was a very
long-winded question.

379
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:37,124
I've already put the primer on my lashes,

380
00:14:37,124 --> 00:14:40,159
and as they're drying, I'm
gonna move onto contour.

381
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,027
This is Tarteist's Pro Glow.

382
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:46,025
Pro Glow Palette. (laughs)

383
00:14:46,025 --> 00:14:47,889
and I'm gonna use this shade's sculpt,

384
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,393
and I'm just gonna start
chiseling the cheeks.

385
00:14:50,393 --> 00:14:52,438
Just gonna warm this up.

386
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,574
Then I'm gonna use the other side,

387
00:14:53,574 --> 00:14:58,080
and I'm just gonna start
contouring the nose a little bit.

388
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,607
I've tried to use cream contours,

389
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,462
but it's literally so difficult
for me to blend it all out,

390
00:15:03,462 --> 00:15:06,115
so I just like to stick with the powders.

391
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,556
So now that the contour is
done, I'm gonna move onto blush.

392
00:15:08,556 --> 00:15:12,844
This is by Hourglass, it's
in Incandescent Electra.

393
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:15,819
And we'll see how this goes,
it's my first time using it.

394
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:17,368
Let's give it a whirl!

395
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:18,938
"What's the most important
thing you learned

396
00:15:18,938 --> 00:15:20,900
"about yourself in college?"

397
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,573
I would say that I learned
to multitask really well.

398
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:26,161
Like, I was able to handle
four to five subjects

399
00:15:26,161 --> 00:15:28,254
in like a quarter or a semester.

400
00:15:28,254 --> 00:15:30,276
And if I was able to multitask that,

401
00:15:30,276 --> 00:15:32,615
then I can definitely juggle
all the projects I do now.

402
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:36,308
I also learned how much
my parents do for me.

403
00:15:36,308 --> 00:15:38,590
Because when I had to move out,

404
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,674
I, you know, you get that reality of like,

405
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,633
whoa, I need to do all my dishes.

406
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:46,192
I need to cook for myself,
I need to do laundry.

407
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,623
It just made me appreciate
my parents so much more.

408
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:51,164
They do a lot of things for
us that we don't even realize,

409
00:15:51,164 --> 00:15:53,863
and moving away from home
is sometimes the only way

410
00:15:53,863 --> 00:15:54,972
you can realize that.

411
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:55,872
So blush is done.

412
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:58,264
I'm gonna go back into
the Tarteist palette.

413
00:15:58,264 --> 00:16:00,093
I'm gonna use Strobe.

414
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,554
And I'm just going to

415
00:16:02,554 --> 00:16:05,993
put that all over the tops of my cheeks.

416
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,608
Oh my God, this smells so good.

417
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,157
It smells like chocolate.

418
00:16:09,157 --> 00:16:11,665
This is how I get so carried
away with highlighter.

419
00:16:11,665 --> 00:16:15,361
This is actually good, because
it's not too pigmented.

420
00:16:15,361 --> 00:16:17,146
Because sometimes when it's too pigmented,

421
00:16:17,146 --> 00:16:19,490
I really just look like
a shiny mess. (laughs)

422
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,501
So now that the face is done,
I'm gonna go back to the eyes.

423
00:16:22,501 --> 00:16:24,855
I'm using this mascara from Shiseido.

424
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:27,182
This is their waterproof one,

425
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:31,421
and I'm just gonna coat
the bottom of my lashes.

426
00:16:31,421 --> 00:16:32,254
Oh.

427
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:37,638
I'm just gonna do a
light layer for the top.

428
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:38,502
Nothing too crazy,

429
00:16:38,502 --> 00:16:41,039
because I'm just gonna pop
some falsies on anyway.

430
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:43,562
For falsies, I'm using
these ones by Velour.

431
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:46,960
This is probably my fourth
or fifth time wearing these,

432
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,452
and I would say they're
still in good shape.

433
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:53,352
So I think I finally nailed
the tools I need for falsies.

434
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:56,654
I have this lash applicator from Velour,

435
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:59,726
and then I also have been
loving Velour's new lash glue.

436
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,226
This is so sticky.

437
00:17:02,084 --> 00:17:03,485
It's awesome.

438
00:17:03,485 --> 00:17:05,423
Like, I used to use Duo before.

439
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:08,337
But this formula is just miles better.

440
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,536
So let's finish this off with a lip color.

441
00:17:10,536 --> 00:17:14,316
I'm using Dohee by ColourPop,
which is my personal shade.

442
00:17:14,316 --> 00:17:16,884
Unfortunately, this is
not available anymore.

443
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:21,569
So just find a nice coral shade
in your collection to apply.

444
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,090
Okay, alright!

445
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,560
I guess I could answer,
like one last question

446
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,516
before I head out.

447
00:17:27,517 --> 00:17:29,354
This is from brittany.tran.

448
00:17:29,354 --> 00:17:32,767
She asks, "How do you deal
with homesickness in college,

449
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:33,833
"and being away from home?"

450
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,573
I remember after two or three
months of being in Davis,

451
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,916
I was like, oh my God, I
have to stay here for like,

452
00:17:38,916 --> 00:17:40,172
another year and a half?

453
00:17:40,172 --> 00:17:44,614
And that was very de-motivating,
but after I don't know,

454
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:47,518
I think after like a good
year, Davis felt like home.

455
00:17:47,518 --> 00:17:49,610
And I think it's all about
just staying connected

456
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,260
to the people back at home,
whether it's, I don't know,

457
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,148
like phone calls, emails, everything.

458
00:17:55,148 --> 00:17:58,109
Just make sure that you
always have a part of home

459
00:17:58,109 --> 00:18:01,407
inside you, and you'll just
be stronger after that.

460
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,079
I think it's just all part of the process,

461
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:05,111
because it makes you
appreciate where you're from

462
00:18:05,111 --> 00:18:06,591
so much more.

463
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,651
And I was really lucky,
because a lot of my friends

464
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:10,174
back at home would come visit me,

465
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,372
like maybe two or three times of the year.

466
00:18:12,372 --> 00:18:13,302
Maybe two.

467
00:18:13,302 --> 00:18:17,243
But still, it was so nice
to see them in my world,

468
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,620
and being able to share that
world with them was so cool.

469
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,369
And I don't know, it's
just part of the process,

470
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,560
and it makes you stronger.

471
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,222
Alright guys, that is a wrap
on this makeup tutorial.

472
00:18:27,222 --> 00:18:28,442
I hope you enjoyed it.

473
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,562
I feel like this is a really
great, like end of summer,

474
00:18:31,562 --> 00:18:33,703
last hurrah makeup look.

475
00:18:33,703 --> 00:18:35,822
Definitely rock this to just anywhere

476
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:38,430
where you wanna have a little
bit of fun and experiment.

477
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,471
If you would like me to
try another makeup look,

478
00:18:40,471 --> 00:18:42,240
please write it in the
comments down below.

479
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,230
I would love to try and tackle that.

480
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,000
And thank you so much for watching.

481
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,415
I hope I've been helpful,

482
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:49,674
or I've entertained you
in some way. (laughs)

483
00:18:49,674 --> 00:18:52,360
Thank you, and I'll see
you guys in the next one.

484
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,645
Bye!

485
00:18:53,645 --> 00:18:55,125
Mwah.

486
00:18:55,125 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
