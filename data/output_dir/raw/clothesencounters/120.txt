1
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,340
We should get Cheeki another toy

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,580
She's been chewing them all up,
haven't you?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,940
Yeah, we could go now.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,600
I'll just drop off the groceries and then
we'll pop on over?

5
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,060
Yeah! Alright, I'm down.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,740
Oh babe? 
Can you grab my sunglasses please?

7
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,780
They should be on the side.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,620
I actually think they're in my bag.
Let me check.

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,320
Well this is unfortunate

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,280
But since we're here this is the perfect time
as any to show you what's in my bag.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,700
So let's take a look, shall we?

12
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,880
Well guys, that concludes the
What's In My Bag section

13
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,440
But let's just keep this stumble between us.

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,940
Babe, you okay?

15
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,040
Oh yeah! I'm okay!

16
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,200
I just yelled cos I found this 
underneath the couch.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,620
You are so cute.

18
00:01:42,920 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm always looking out for you two.
