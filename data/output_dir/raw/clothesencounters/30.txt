1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,603
(mysterious music)

2
00:00:03,603 --> 00:00:05,443
(evil laughing)

3
00:00:05,443 --> 00:00:07,927
- 'Tis the season for Halloween.

4
00:00:07,927 --> 00:00:10,009
I've partnered with Simple
Skincare to show you

5
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,711
these two killer looks to rock this year.

6
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:14,519
First, I'm gonna show you how I did this

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,415
dead bride look and
then into a disco alien.

8
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:20,215
I'll be using Simple's products from their

9
00:00:20,215 --> 00:00:21,895
water boost line, in between the looks

10
00:00:21,895 --> 00:00:23,592
so that way I can keep my skin hydrated

11
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:25,624
during this spooky time.

12
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:28,930
All right, so let's get
started with the first look.

13
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,828
So here I am with fresh clean skin and I'm

14
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:34,588
gonna use Simple's hydrating
booster to prep my skin.

15
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:36,966
Since I'm gonna be putting
a lot of stuff on my face,

16
00:00:36,966 --> 00:00:38,662
I wanna make sure that it's hydrated.

17
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:41,889
I love this booster because
it also acts as a primer,

18
00:00:41,889 --> 00:00:44,386
so it's gonna make sure that
everything stays on tact.

19
00:00:44,386 --> 00:00:46,263
Now that my skin is ready and good to go,

20
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:47,742
it's time for concealer.

21
00:00:47,742 --> 00:00:49,436
I'm using Colourpop's No Filter Concealer

22
00:00:49,436 --> 00:00:52,053
in the shade light and I'm
gonna start applying it

23
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,522
all over my face as the first base.

24
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,344
Then with a damp makeup sponge I'm just

25
00:00:56,344 --> 00:00:58,008
gonna blend that baby out.

26
00:00:58,008 --> 00:00:59,678
I wanted my face to be a little lighter

27
00:00:59,678 --> 00:01:01,594
so I'm gonna go in with foundation now,

28
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,911
just doing the usual, dot it on my face

29
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,569
and then blending it out.

30
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,071
The next step is powder.

31
00:01:07,071 --> 00:01:10,080
I'm using my trusty Laura
Mercier translucent one

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,566
and I'm just gonna set that
in so that nothing budges.

33
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:16,632
For my brows, I'm using
Benefit's Goof Proof Brow Pencil

34
00:01:16,632 --> 00:01:18,899
and I'm just gonna do
my usual brow routine.

35
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:21,317
At first I was tempted
to use a black eyeliner,

36
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,118
but I thought I'd go for
something more wearable.

37
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,039
Okay, brows done.

38
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:28,300
All right, so let's move onto eye shadow.

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,627
I'm using NYX's Jumbo Eye Pencil and I'm

40
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:33,288
gonna use this as a
base for our ultra smoky

41
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:34,329
dead bride look.

42
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,948
Feel free to be lax with application

43
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:37,458
because after you do this, you're gonna

44
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:40,159
get a dense brush and start
to smoke the edges out.

45
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,024
Then I'm gonna go in
with the same eye pencil

46
00:01:42,024 --> 00:01:44,102
again and start covering the lower lid.

47
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:45,923
Go in with that same brush and start to

48
00:01:45,923 --> 00:01:47,846
smoke it out the best you can.

49
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:49,701
Don't trip if it doesn't look too perfect,

50
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,854
because in the end, you're a dead bride,

51
00:01:51,854 --> 00:01:53,823
so it's all right if it
looks a little messy.

52
00:01:53,823 --> 00:01:56,793
Now I'm using Kat Von
D's Monarch Pallette.

53
00:01:56,793 --> 00:01:58,881
I'm grabbing the matte black eye shadow

54
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,230
and I'm just gonna start
packing it all over my lid.

55
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,499
I'm doing like a little patting motion

56
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,793
instead of a sweeping one because

57
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:06,894
I wanna minimize the fall out.

58
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,656
Then I'm gonna use a dense, fluffy brush

59
00:02:08,656 --> 00:02:10,369
and start smoking this all out.

60
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:12,257
Next up, I'm taking
this burnt sienna shade

61
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,271
and using this as a transition shade.

62
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:16,748
I did kind of like a
slight winged out shape

63
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,043
just so it looks a little glam.

64
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,764
Then I'm gonna go back
into the same sienna color

65
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:24,105
and I'm gonna drag that out
for the bottom of my eyes.

66
00:02:24,105 --> 00:02:25,634
Grab a black eyeliner
now and start tightlining

67
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:28,364
the bottom half of the
eye, this is just gonna

68
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:31,863
smoke the look out even more
and intensify everything.

69
00:02:31,863 --> 00:02:34,193
Then I'm gonna grab a
cheek brush and I'm just

70
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:36,644
gonna dip it inside that
sienna color and start

71
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:39,107
using that as a contour shade.

72
00:02:39,107 --> 00:02:40,876
I kinda went a little harsh with this,

73
00:02:40,876 --> 00:02:42,846
so I'm using a makeup sponge to blend

74
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,639
the imperfections that I made.

75
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,045
There, much better.

76
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:48,681
I'm gonna quickly pop on some falsies now

77
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,228
for some instant vavoom.

78
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:51,943
Now using a black pencil liner I'm gonna

79
00:02:51,943 --> 00:02:54,640
start drawing the skeleton nose onto mine.

80
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,943
I went for, like a rounder shape,

81
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:59,587
because I wanted my nose
to look more button-like.

82
00:02:59,587 --> 00:03:01,416
Then go in with a
concealer and start whiting

83
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,019
out your lips, you want a super pale base

84
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,863
because we're about to
draw some skeleton teeth.

85
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:08,471
First using a black liner I'm gonna start

86
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,778
drawing the inside of
my lips to make me look

87
00:03:10,778 --> 00:03:13,851
more dead, then I'm gonna
lightly drag the pencil

88
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:16,418
out to the corners of my lips to give them

89
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:18,274
the illusion that they open wider.

90
00:03:18,274 --> 00:03:20,202
I'm gonna draw the outside skull

91
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:22,522
teeth first and then
I'm gonna grab my liquid

92
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,599
eyeliner and I'm gonna redraw and sharpen

93
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,156
the lines in the corners of my mouth

94
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:28,064
and also along the lips.

95
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,760
Using the liquid liner is easier than

96
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,135
the pencil because you can
be more precise with it.

97
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,118
I shaded the inside of
my lip a little darker

98
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,005
and now I'm done.

99
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:38,429
Throw on a black wig, grab a veil,

100
00:03:38,429 --> 00:03:42,089
and prepare for the ultimate
wedding of the underworld.

101
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,107
I love that this look is a little creepy,

102
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:46,853
but still sultry as hell.

103
00:03:46,853 --> 00:03:48,582
Now, it's time to take of the wig

104
00:03:48,582 --> 00:03:50,246
and all this makeup off so that we

105
00:03:50,246 --> 00:03:51,941
can transition into the next look.

106
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:54,158
First, I'm gonna use
Simple's Cleansing Facial

107
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,130
Wipes and start removing the first layer

108
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,993
of makeup off.

109
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:59,372
You guys know that these wipes are my jam

110
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,430
and I love how soft and effective they

111
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,041
are for removing the first
portion of my makeup.

112
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:06,140
See, look at all that gunk.

113
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,568
Now I'm going in with Simple's Water Boost

114
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,119
Micellar Cleansing Water.

115
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,008
I'm soaking up a cotton round and then

116
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,248
gently removing the
remainder of my makeup.

117
00:04:14,248 --> 00:04:16,742
This formula is awesome
because it's refreshing

118
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:18,469
and rehydrates the skin.

119
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:19,897
And there are no harsh chemicals,

120
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:21,291
which is always a plus.

121
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,900
Okay so now that makeup is finally off,

122
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,034
let's start the second look.

123
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:27,680
First, I'm just gonna prime the skin again

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,268
with Simple's Hydrating Booster.

125
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,116
My skin has been through a lot today

126
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:32,932
so it's important that I add this step

127
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:35,391
so it's hydrated and primed
for the second round.

128
00:04:35,391 --> 00:04:37,623
So I'm basically doing
the exact same steps

129
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:38,512
as the previous look.

130
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,056
I put the concealer on my face,

131
00:04:40,056 --> 00:04:42,371
added powder, and then drew on my brows.

132
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,711
Now that we're up to speed,

133
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:46,330
I'm gonna go in with
another NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil

134
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,673
in this lovely green shade that I honestly

135
00:04:48,673 --> 00:04:49,798
thought I'd never use.

136
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:52,857
I'm gonna start coloring
it all over my lid.

137
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:55,279
Then going in with Colourpop's Cusp,

138
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,705
I'm gonna pack this shimmery emerald shade

139
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:59,203
all over the base.

140
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:02,254
I'm honestly just
obsessed with this color.

141
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:04,907
Now I'm gonna go in
with my Lo-key palette,

142
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:07,100
I'm gonna grab this orange shade and start

143
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,676
using that as my transitions shade to

144
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,367
blend this crazy green out.

145
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:12,942
Surprisingly the orange looks really good.

146
00:05:12,942 --> 00:05:15,293
I never thought that
this would be the color

147
00:05:15,293 --> 00:05:18,173
to blend out really unusual shades.

148
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:20,250
I'm picking another adventurous color,

149
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,334
this is wild thoughts and I'm just gonna

150
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:25,603
start going in all under
the lower part of the eye.

151
00:05:25,603 --> 00:05:28,511
I just basically picked
out a bunch of intimidating

152
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,267
colors that I never use for this look.

153
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:33,505
Then I'm grabbing my
liquid liner and drawing

154
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:34,926
my usual cat eye.

155
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,951
I just realized that I
wanted a little extra oomp

156
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:39,267
so I grabbed this champagne color and

157
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:42,505
added it to the inner
corners and brow bone.

158
00:05:42,505 --> 00:05:44,122
Now I'm skipping mascara and I'm popping

159
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:46,158
on these big fluffy lashes.

160
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:49,682
These add the drama that
I want for this look.

161
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,450
I wanted to add a
celestial element to this

162
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,608
so I'm using Urban Decay's Heavy Metal amp

163
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:56,824
and I'm adding this green sparkly glitter

164
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,210
to the top part of my lid.

165
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,343
I love glitter, so this
is very much needed.

166
00:06:01,343 --> 00:06:03,616
Then using Stila's liquid eyeshadow,

167
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:05,332
I'm gonna take this violet glitter

168
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,216
and start covering the lower
half of the eye as well.

169
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:11,304
This is Halloween, folks,
so go big or go home.

170
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,331
Now using my favorite
highlighter, I'm just

171
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,668
gonna dust this onto
the apples of my cheeks,

172
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,827
nose bridge and Cupid's bow.

173
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:19,581
For the lips, I'm going for a darker color

174
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,601
so I'm lining my lips
with a black pencil liner.

175
00:06:22,601 --> 00:06:24,819
Most of the time I don't
really line my lips,

176
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,255
but for dark colors,
it is an absolute must.

177
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,377
I'm finally busting out squid ink

178
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:31,909
from my collection and
I'm gonna apply it all

179
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,192
over the lips, this is such a cool color

180
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:38,283
because it's like a
dark, dark indigo shade.

181
00:06:38,283 --> 00:06:39,356
This is definitely one of the most

182
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:41,109
challenging colors that
I've ever applied on

183
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,358
my lips, but, I tried my
best, please don't kill me.

184
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:45,764
Now that I'm finished, I'm gonna throw on

185
00:06:45,764 --> 00:06:48,460
my rainbow wig and my
little alien antennas.

186
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,928
I love how whimsical this look is

187
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:53,190
because of all the variety of colors.

188
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,272
This is the perfect look for parties,

189
00:06:55,272 --> 00:06:57,177
whether it's Halloween or not.

190
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:59,286
All right guys, that is
a wrap for this video.

191
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,521
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

192
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,031
I would love to know what you are

193
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:03,615
gonna be for Halloween this year.

194
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:05,239

207
00:07:26,047 --> 00:00:00,000
(whimsical music)
