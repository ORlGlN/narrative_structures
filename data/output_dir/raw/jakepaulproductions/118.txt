Man:
We're screwed.

- ( growling )
- ( screaming )

27
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,774
- What's up?
- What's up?

28
00:02:59,645 --> 00:03:02,582
All the windows
are blacked out.
This is sketchy.

29
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,392
You already scared?

30
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:29,475
Oh, Anwar.
Are you sure
you'll protect me?

31
00:03:29,508 --> 00:03:31,444
No promises.

32
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,121
- ( imitates growl )
- ( laughs )

33
00:03:42,154 --> 00:03:46,192
Oh, my God.
I've never been this scared,
I'm telling you.

34
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,177
Me and Anwar are in this
blacked out SUV car

35
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,946
and we have no idea
where we're going.

36
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,217
<i> And the car opens up
 to a VIP reception tent.</i>

37
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,453
- Your photo?
- I was expecting
  zombies immediately,

38
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:17,023
or a big bag to be
pulled over my head.

39
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:28,401
I love this setup.
Like, this whole festival
setup is sick.

40
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:32,204
I love "The Walking Dead,"
I go to, like, every Coachella
event.

41
00:04:32,237 --> 00:04:34,374
It's like combining
both worlds together.

42
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:37,710
( growls )

43
00:04:39,645 --> 00:04:42,081
Open this door.
All right.

44
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,585
I know.

45
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:49,188
( growls )

46
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,030
Put your festival
bracelet on.

47
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:02,135
( growling )

48
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,341
We got to our destination
and they opened the door.

49
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:11,577
And I see the
Paradise Calls logo.

50
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,579
Okay, so you're
kind of terrified.

51
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:15,147
Yeah.

52
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,149
It was 10:00
by the time we got here,

53
00:05:17,182 --> 00:05:19,118
so I knew something
was going down.

54
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:22,155
And as soon as we got here,
it got real real quick.

55
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:27,126
Oh, we're both
General Admission.

56
00:05:27,159 --> 00:05:29,328
- ( both laugh )
- What are the chances?

57
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:31,330
- We're ready for you.
- Uh-oh!

58
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:34,033
( growls )

59
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,002
We have some wristbands
for you.

60
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,572
- All right.
- Okay.

61
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,674
We got out of the car,

62
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:43,542
started putting on
these heavy suits.

63
00:05:43,575 --> 00:05:48,348
Like, we were just completely
and utterly confused and lost.

64
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,984
I have $100
on it's a prison.

65
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:54,587
I got 100 down that says
it's a lake house.

66
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,423
Paradise Calls.
Oh, shit.

67
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,691
And I answered.

68
00:05:58,724 --> 00:06:01,360
We were just on edge,
ready to play.

69
00:06:01,393 --> 00:06:03,662
<i> When we pulled up
 and opened the door,
 it was just a photo shoot.</i>

70
00:06:03,695 --> 00:06:06,232
Like, why did we have to be
blacked out for a photo shoot?

71
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,366
It didn't make sense.

72
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,302
Do you like my poses?

73
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,276
No one's safe, bro.

74
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:19,311
I had my guard up.
I was about to karate chop

75
00:06:19,344 --> 00:06:20,746
some people's faces off.

76
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,350
I'm like, "Yo, I got this, fam.
I got this!"

77
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,387
( growling )

78
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:32,458
We at Paradise Calls
sincerely hope

79
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,428
you're enjoying your Surrender
to Fun intake process.

80
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,463
Please follow your escorts
to your assigned--

81
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:40,533
please follow your escorts
to your assigned areas.

82
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:44,703
I'm really nervous.

83
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:47,573
Copy you.
Let's go, kids.

84
00:06:51,877 --> 00:06:55,648
So they're walking me and Anwar
out to the main stage,

85
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:58,317
<i> and at this point,
 I am memorizing</i>

86
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,589
<i> all the doors and exits
to all the different buildings.</i>

87
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:06,659
<i> I was expecting anything
 but a music festival.</i>

88
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:09,829
<i> I really don't know what
 to expect, at this point.</i>

89
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:18,704
P.A.:<i>
 Please settle in at your
 assigned locations.</i>

90
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:21,174
<i> The show will begin
 in five minutes.</i>

91
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:36,922
We go into this VIP area
where these zombies are--

92
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:39,926
and they're actually zombies,
I guess, that help us.

93
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,936
<i> Can't really talk to 'em.
 They don't talk to you.</i>

94
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,312
( growls )

95
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,518
All right, we already have some
dead people walking in.

96
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,320
( growling )

97
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:12,558
We got escorted
to, like, these little cages
in front of the stage.

98
00:08:16,828 --> 00:08:20,633
And then we got locked in
by the guards, which was
really scary.

99
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,736
<i> And there were, like,
 zombies all around us.</i>

100
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:27,740
We're ( bleep ).

101
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:35,081
- ( vocalizing )
- Yeah, he's ready.

102
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,085
Whoo!

103
00:08:40,118 --> 00:08:41,620
Put me in, coach,
I'm ready.

104
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,222
Oh, snap.

105
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:46,625
Oh, shit.

106
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:48,127
Oh, it's not a game, bro.

107
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,564
First thoughts?
I feel we got this, bro.

108
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,832
- Like, lots of room to run.
- Not scared.

109
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:58,470
Anthony:<i>
 Jake and I are like
 more funny characters.</i>

110
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,172
We don't take
everything as serious,

111
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:03,275
but this was pretty scary,
so we were just trying
to make jokes,

112
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:04,743
make us feel
a little more comfortable.

113
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:07,479
It's like
a terrible Coachella.

114
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,148
I swear
that one's my grandpa.

115
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:11,150
That one?

116
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,819
Well, these are prime
seating for the show.

117
00:09:13,852 --> 00:09:16,522
- Oh, great.
- Oh.

118
00:09:19,257 --> 00:09:20,726
I see you, zombies.

119
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,162
I'm just excited
to enjoy this festival

120
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:24,563
with all these
lively people.

121
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,599
( laughs )

122
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:35,374
This is sketchy as hell.

123
00:09:35,407 --> 00:09:37,209
I kind of feel safe
up here, though.

124
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:48,354
Oh, shit.
Save us, please, first!

125
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:51,490
P.A.:<i> Thank you for
 your participation
 in Paradise Calls.</i>

126
00:09:51,523 --> 00:09:53,626
The show is about to begin.

127
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,262
( groaning )

128
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,377
So, we're up onstage.
They have taiko drummers
and dancers.

129
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,580
I'm not really sure
what ConOp is trying
to sell us on.

130
00:10:14,613 --> 00:10:17,483
( music playing )

131
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:20,953
Wengie:<i>
 When the show started,
 it was just me and Juanpa</i>

132
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:23,089
like, sitting there going,
"What is happening?"

133
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,666
Now that you're all settled in--
settled in--

134
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:36,468
let me be the first
to welcome you to the site

135
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:39,104
of the upcoming Paradise Calls

136
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:42,341
music fest-- fest--
music festival.

137
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:47,546
A fun-filled time
featuring top artists
and cool tech.

138
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,915
On that note, allow me
to turn things over

139
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:51,684
to Paradise Calls'
best and brightest,

140
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,421
the head of our Paradise Calls
initiative, Dr. June Nada.

141
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:07,166
Welcome.

142
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,270
For decades, zombies have been
the subject of fear,

143
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,839
distrust, and bigotry.

144
00:11:13,872 --> 00:11:17,076
But now, through the wonder
of technology

145
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,811
and the power of music,

146
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,247
we hope to end necrophobia
forever

147
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,751
and prove that ConOp-engineered
necrotic bioforms

148
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:28,220
can light the way
to a better future.

149
00:11:28,253 --> 00:11:32,558
Imagine a world
where menial tasks
and manual labor

150
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,427
are a thing of the past.

151
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,396
Take my friend Bob here.

152
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:40,733
Bob is a Tasker,
a completely safe

153
00:11:40,766 --> 00:11:43,769
and subservient
necrotic bioform.

154
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:47,206
Bob receives a command signal
through his viewing hardware
here,

155
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,374
and sees it on the screen
in front of him,

156
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:52,411
telling him
exactly what to do.

157
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:55,314
As long as Bob's eyes
are glued to that screen,

158
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,649
he will obey whatever
the screen commands.

159
00:11:57,682 --> 00:11:59,752
I have nothing to fear.

160
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:03,222
Bob would never try
to eat my brains.

161
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:06,091
So this lady comes out 
talking about, "We've got
nothing to fear."

162
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,993
It's lit, whatever,
this festival's gonna be
on and poppin'.

163
00:12:08,026 --> 00:12:10,329
That's-- I knew right away,
that's balony.

164
00:12:10,362 --> 00:12:14,032
At ConOp,
we are at the brink
of a new world,

165
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:17,469
one where the non-living
and their undeceased friends

166
00:12:17,502 --> 00:12:19,905
can collaborate
together as one.

167
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,508
If you don't believe me,
then take a look

168
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:25,477
at the Paradise Calls
harmony dancers.

169
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,646
May I?

170
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,914
Let's dance.

171
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:32,351
( music playing )

172
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:36,355
You are a wonderful dancer.

173
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:39,224
We get to see a little show,
do a little dance,

174
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:41,794
see the zombies party,
get krunk.

175
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:46,732
( electronic screeching )

176
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,277
Down.
Stay down.

177
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,413
( alarm blaring )

178
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:04,150
( screaming )

179
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:10,422
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.

180
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:14,293
Uh-oh, we're screwed, bro.
We're screwed.

181
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,030
Their systems ( bleep ) up
and all hell breaks loose.

182
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,099
Robotic voice:<i>
 Emergency, emergency.</i>

183
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,569
<i> Skypole and primary power
 offline.</i>

184
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:27,540
- ( screaming )
- ( growling )

185
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,381
Okay.

186
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:39,184
( alarm continues blaring )

187
00:13:39,217 --> 00:13:41,887
Here, follow me,
follow me.

188
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:47,192
Use the secret tunnel,
It'll take you to the VIP room.

189
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,328
You'll be safe there!

190
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:53,199
- ( growling )
- ( screams ) Come on!

191
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,670
Well, that's why I told you
we shoulda been doing something.

192
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:02,641
Holy Jesus Christ.
That was a jump.

193
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:06,445
( screaming )

194
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,081
The safe house!
Go to the safe house!

195
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,683
( screams )

196
00:14:11,716 --> 00:14:12,918
How do we get in?

197
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:16,321
( screaming )

198
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,824
( alarm blaring )

199
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:21,360
I know, it was hard.

200
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,397
Oh, my God.
Are we the first ones in here?

201
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,965
So we're under the stage

202
00:14:26,998 --> 00:14:28,934
and there's a maze
under the stage

203
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:31,003
and we're having
to crawl through it.

204
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,008
<i> We don't know
 where we're going</i>

205
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:40,646
and I feel like I was way more
anxious than Anwar, nervous.

206
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:44,283
At this point, my heart rate
is up, my adrenaline is up.

207
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:45,517
I have to run.

208
00:14:51,022 --> 00:14:54,660
Go, go, go.
Run, run. Run!

209
00:14:54,693 --> 00:14:56,595
I didn't make you do this.

210
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:05,938
( zombie growling )

211
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,511
( roars )

212
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,849
( man screaming )

213
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,165
Oh, my sweet Jesus.

214
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,534
There's people acting weird.
Zombies start attacking us.

215
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:39,237
<i> Some guard hands me a key.</i>

216
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,940
I got a key.

217
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:43,642
I got it.
I got it.

218
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:45,177
Back up!

219
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,912
<i> They're like,
 "Go to the VIP tent."</i>

220
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:48,647
I'm like, "I don't know where
that is, bro.

221
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,549
Like, what are you
talking about?"

222
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,118
( screams )
I'm out of this bitch!

223
00:15:56,187 --> 00:15:58,690
All I hear is "VIP tent"
and I remembered

224
00:15:58,723 --> 00:16:02,327
because I memorized
where that was on the map

225
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,131
and we just start sprinting.

226
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,132
VIP room!

227
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:09,134
<i> I see a couple
 of my friends</i>

228
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:10,769
<i> and I'm like,
 "Yo, what's good?"</i>

229
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:11,770
And we're, like,
running from zombies, I'm like,

230
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:14,740
"Yo, what's good, man?"

231
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:17,943
Get in. Get in.
Get in.

232
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,278
Whoo!

233
00:16:20,311 --> 00:16:22,848
Yo, what's up, guys?
Party!

234
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,083
Yo, this is lit.
My boy.

235
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,119
I'm doing good.
Wow, this is nice.

236
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,488
- Uh-oh, did we lock it?
- Yeah.

237
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,024
( growling )

238
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:33,826
What are we
supposed to do?

239
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:40,098
Where do we have--
we have to run in there?

240
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:41,232
Juanpa:
Yeah.

241
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,235
The zombies were literally
getting really aggressive

242
00:16:43,268 --> 00:16:45,537
<i> and, like, we didn't know
 we were gonna get out</i>

243
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:47,305
<i> 'cause we didn't
 have a key to undo the lock.</i>

244
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,941
<i> My only thought was, like,
 "I'm not dying right now.</i>

245
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:53,245
I don't know how I'm gonna
do it, but I'm gonna survive
this part."

246
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:55,881
P.A.:<i>
 Attention ConOp guard,</i>

247
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:58,817
<i> you are authorized to issue
 key to subjects.</i>

248
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,686
- ( growling )
- It's right here.

249
00:17:01,719 --> 00:17:03,689
You got the key.

250
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:08,494
So we finally got the lock
off the door.

251
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,933
( shouting, screaming )

252
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:17,768
Oh, shit!
Aw, shit!

253
00:17:17,801 --> 00:17:21,705
I just, like,
shot straight towards
the VIP tent.

254
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:24,109
( screams )

255
00:17:24,142 --> 00:17:25,444
Open, open!

256
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,447
I was like, "Oh, please,
I don't want to die.

257
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,349
It's only been
like five minutes."

258
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,486
( door slams )

259
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:42,094
P.A.:<i>
 Attention guests,
 before we can progress,</i>

260
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,997
<i> your complete team must be
 accounted for in the VIP tent.</i>

261
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,869
<i> I repeat, your complete
 team must be present
 in the VIP tent.</i>

262
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:53,171
So there's just a bunch of chaos
happening right now.

263
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:56,208
We have-- two of
our teammates are missing.

264
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,778
Not getting out this way.
Something's blocking it.
Something's blocking it?

265
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:06,718
- I can't.
- Oh, my God,
  no, she's coming.

266
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,086
I can't.
I can't get out.

267
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,188
We happened to just make it
into the business center.

268
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:12,491
Everything just went crazy.
The Taskers went crazy.

269
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:14,159
They were no longer
our friends anymore.

270
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:18,630
- Some pretty
  pissed off zombies.
- Look-- ooh!

271
00:18:24,202 --> 00:18:26,671
( growling )

272
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:29,141
Yeah, we're for sure dead.

273
00:18:29,174 --> 00:18:31,776
Ken:<i>
 There was no instructions.
 There was nothing in the room.</i>

274
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:34,746
I was freaking out,
De Arra was freakin' out.

275
00:18:36,981 --> 00:18:38,717
And die together?

276
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,752
I mean, we were just
on another level.

277
00:18:40,785 --> 00:18:44,656
I think that's when everything
became real for both of us.

278
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:48,293
Where do we go, man?
We are literally stuck
in this room.

279
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:50,428
I'm just wondering,
is anybody gonna come get us?

280
00:18:50,461 --> 00:18:51,496
Like, anybody?

281
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,399
- It's on right now.
- Shh!

282
00:18:54,432 --> 00:18:55,934
Oh, snap.
This thing's on right here?

283
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:58,537
- Huh?
- It's on.

284
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,173
- Oh, there they are.
- There, there.

285
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,375
- Oh!
- Everybody?

286
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:05,310
Yeah, they're
all over there.

287
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,345
They're in an office.
They're in an office.

288
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:09,447
( pounding )

289
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,018
Oh, look at the door handle.
Oh, shit.

290
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:15,954
Oh, God.
I would not want
to be in there.

291
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,023
Look for the microphone.

292
00:19:18,056 --> 00:19:21,960
- Is this one?
- Yeah, right here.

293
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,528
- This microphone?
- Yeah.

294
00:19:23,561 --> 00:19:25,463
( voice echoing )
This microphone? Hello?

295
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:27,599
- Hey!
- What? Yo!

296
00:19:27,632 --> 00:19:31,469
Can you hear us?

297
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:33,605
Hello, hello?

298
00:19:33,638 --> 00:19:35,173
Waive your hands
if you can hear me.

299
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:38,076
- Yes, yes, here you go.
- They can hear you.
  They can hear you!

300
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,378
They're waiving their hands.
They're waiving their hands.

301
00:19:40,411 --> 00:19:42,480
We don't know what to do.
They can't even hear us

302
00:19:42,513 --> 00:19:45,317
so we gotta, like,
be showing them signals

303
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,985
<i> with our hands,
 like sign language.</i>

304
00:19:47,018 --> 00:19:49,287
It was just--
it's a hot mess.

305
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,522
Hold on.
I'ma talk to 'em.

306
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:53,258
Come here,
I've done this before.

307
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,529
You guys have
to come here.

308
00:19:57,562 --> 00:20:01,466
Oh, shit.
Oh, hell, no.

309
00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:04,536
- You have--
- You said we have
  to come to you.

310
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:07,038
Yes!
Yes! Yes!

311
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:08,974
- De Arra: No, how do
  we come to him?
- Run!

312
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,242
He said, "Run."

313
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:14,145
- V-I-P.
- Ken: VIP?

314
00:20:14,178 --> 00:20:16,581
- That's right, yes!
- VIP, uh-huh, okay.

315
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:18,316
VIP tent.
VIP tent.

316
00:20:18,349 --> 00:20:19,784
- Ken: Where's that?
- I don't ( bleep ) know.

317
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,820
- You guys are
  in the VIP tent.
- Yes.

318
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:23,922
De Arra:
He said yes.

319
00:20:23,955 --> 00:20:26,858
Hey, someone try
to flag them down.

320
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:28,827
I'm gonna figure out
what's going on with these
zombies.

321
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,863
- Hannah: Hey!
- Here's Hannah. She's trying
  to say something to us.

322
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,832
Hey!

323
00:20:33,865 --> 00:20:35,734
Jake has the key.

324
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,469
They have a key.

325
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,571
- Okay, I'm gonna go talk.
- Hey!

326
00:20:39,604 --> 00:20:42,240
- De Arra:
  You guys have a key.
- Yeah! Yes!

327
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,476
Ken: What key?

328
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:47,646
We're trying to get to you guys,
but there's no way out.

329
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,783
I am running to you.

330
00:20:51,816 --> 00:20:56,321
"I am going to run to you."
He says he's going to run to us.

331
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:59,224
Okay, okay, we're waiting.
Hurry.

332
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:01,259
I'm gonna figure out
what's going on with these
zombies.

333
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,828
Who wants to go?

334
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,163
I'm down.
Let's go, let's go.

335
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,065
You want to go?

336
00:21:07,098 --> 00:21:09,100
All right,
let's do it, boys!

337
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:12,470
- Get behind
  the stage, let's go.
- To the right.

338
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:15,407
Behind the stage, Jake.
Behind the stage.

339
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:22,847
- Uh-oh.
- Okay, shit, shit.

340
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,784
Here, here, take it.
Use it. Use it here.

341
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,686
Move, move,
move, move, move.

342
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,121
- Shit.
- ( buzzes )

343
00:21:30,154 --> 00:21:32,023
( mumbling )

344
00:21:32,056 --> 00:21:33,091
Okay, yeah, shit, okay.

345
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,127
( indistinct chatter )

346
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,198
All right, go,
get out, get out!

347
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:41,499
( screaming )

348
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:44,436
Get back in!
Open, open, Jake!

349
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,105
Yo, come on!
Come on, move!

350
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:50,342
Hey, stay still.
Go!

351
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,545
( De Arra screaming )

352
00:21:54,812 --> 00:21:56,147
Oh, they're coming,
they're coming.

353
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,450
- Go.
- Stay together!

354
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,086
Go!

355
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,922
( growling )

356
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,460
Go, go, hurry, hurry.

357
00:22:12,096 --> 00:22:14,933
- Whoo!
- Jesus!

358
00:22:14,966 --> 00:22:17,535
We did it!
What's up, fam!

359
00:22:17,568 --> 00:22:20,472
What's good?
What's good?

360
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,107
- Squad.
- What's up?

361
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,542
We did it!
We're good.

362
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,911
So, we survived,
we achieved the first mission.

363
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,414
- And more.
- We leveled up.

364
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:30,749
- We leveled up.
- We leveled up.

365
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,851
We're gonna have
more speed now.

366
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:35,186
And we got warmed up
'cause now we know how
to communicate with each other.

367
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,188
- It's great.
- It's crazy.

368
00:22:37,221 --> 00:22:41,025
- Okay.
- That was dope.

369
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:44,996
( groaning )

370
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:47,932
P.A.:<i>
 Subjects, congratulations
 on bringing your team</i>

371
00:22:47,965 --> 00:22:49,901
<i> safely to the VIP tent.</i>

372
00:22:49,934 --> 00:22:52,203
<i> As we try to restore
 the festival,</i>

373
00:22:52,236 --> 00:22:54,806
<i> please turn your attention
 to a brief announcement</i>

374
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:57,175
<i> from the project manager.</i>

375
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,943
<i> You are in an extremely
 dangerous situation right now.</i>

376
00:22:58,976 --> 00:23:00,945
<i> Extremely dangerous
 situation right now.</i>

377
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:03,715
<i> Due to an external
 terrorist attack,</i>

378
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:06,651
<i> we're running on reserve power
 and our infrastructure
 is offline-- offline.</i>

379
00:23:06,684 --> 00:23:09,287
<i> We need your help.
 We need your help.</i>

380
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,756
<i> Your number one goal
 should be to simply survive,</i>

381
00:23:11,789 --> 00:23:14,225
<i> but your only hope-- only
 hope-- is to perform missions</i>

382
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:17,195
<i> to help us get our
 infrastructure back online.</i>

383
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:19,397
<i> Particularly, the Skypole,</i>

384
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,866
<i> the transmission tower
 in the middle of the village.</i>

385
00:23:21,899 --> 00:23:23,268
<i> Once the Skypole
 is operable,</i>

386
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,336
<i> we can call for reinforcements
 and an extraction team</i>

387
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,472
<i> probably within 72 hours.</i>

388
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:31,209
<i> Paradise Calls' announcer
 will be reaching out to you
 with further instructions.</i>

389
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,812
<i> But for now, make yourself
 at home. Enjoy the bungalow.</i>

390
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:36,681
Repair the Sky Tower,
get the ( bleep ) out.

391
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:39,451
- That's easy.
- Let's go do it right now.

392
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:43,054
P.A.:<i>
 ConOp guards are here
 to help as much as they can.</i>

393
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:46,291
<i> We regret, however,
 that we cannot guarantee
 your safety</i>

394
00:23:46,324 --> 00:23:49,194
<i> for the rest of your stay
 at Paradise Calls.</i>

395
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,997
<i> That said, we hope
 you enjoy your stay.</i>

396
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:55,200
Woman #2:<i>
 This is crazy!</i>

397
00:23:56,901 --> 00:24:00,638
Announcer:<i>
 This season on "Fight
 of the Living Dead"...</i>

398
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:02,740
And then
our missions started.

399
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:04,008
- I'm running.
- He's running.

400
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:06,744
Hey, run, run, run!
Run, guys!

401
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:09,747
I think they were
sending a message.

402
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,183
They were sending a message
that they're not playing around.

403
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:14,752
Come on!
Come on, Anwar!

404
00:24:14,785 --> 00:24:16,454
- ( screams )
- Hannah, Hannah.

405
00:24:16,487 --> 00:24:19,491
We figured out that Taskers
do specific things,

406
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,093
but if it's offline,
they go crazy.

407
00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:24,128
Anwar, Anwar! Anwar!

408
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,498
Oh, no, no, no, no!

409
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,134
I notice little Nymph Girl,
she starts motioning for us.

410
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,403
And I'm like,
"She communicatin'.

411
00:24:32,436 --> 00:24:33,805
What is going on?
What the hell?"

412
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,841
( growling )

413
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,343
What do you know
about Branch 4?

414
00:24:38,376 --> 00:24:40,044
What's Branch 4?

415
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:41,746
The only thing we know
is that Branch 4

416
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:43,014
are trying
to get rid of ConOp.

417
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,250
Okay, what's happening?
Who do I trust now?

418
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,885
You can never
be chill out there.

419
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,787
( shouting )

420
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,892
We'll keep going, completing
missions, and hopefully we can
keep everybody alive.

421
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,065
<i> ( music playing )</i>

422
00:25:01,098 --> 00:00:00,000
Somebody help me!
