REALLY HAVING A HARD TIME.

1680
02:08:27,199 --> 02:08:29,067
I AM RELEASING MY MUSIC IN

1681
02:08:29,067 --> 02:08:29,601
CHAPTERS.

1682
02:08:29,601 --> 02:08:31,102
THAT'S WHEN I WAS ON CHAPTER

1683
02:08:31,102 --> 02:08:34,673
ONE, WHICH WAS BLUE.

1684
02:08:34,673 --> 02:08:36,441
I RODE ALL THREE OF THOSE SONGS

1685
02:08:36,441 --> 02:08:38,142
IN PART OF MY LIFE WHEN I WAS

1686
02:08:38,142 --> 02:08:39,545
REALLY LOST.

1687
02:08:39,545 --> 02:08:41,980
I KNOW WE ALL FEEL THAT WAY.

1688
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:43,047
SOMETIMES.

1689
02:08:43,047 --> 02:08:43,681
CHAPTER ONE IS REALLY IMPORTANT

1690
02:08:43,681 --> 02:08:44,349
TO ME BECAUSE I FELT LIKE IF I

1691
02:08:44,349 --> 02:08:48,253
WERE YOU, IT'S WHAT I WOULD WANT

1692
02:08:48,253 --> 02:08:48,921
TO HEAR FROM ME.

1693
02:08:48,921 --> 02:08:51,623
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1694
02:08:51,623 --> 02:08:52,891
I WOULD WANT THAT REASSURANCE.

1695
02:08:52,891 --> 02:08:55,560
JUST BECAUSE I AM ON STAGE

1696
02:08:55,560 --> 02:08:55,560
DOESN'T MEAN I

1697
02:08:55,560 --> 02:09:00,065
 -- I DON'T HAVE

1698
02:09:00,065 --> 02:09:04,937
PROBLEMS TOO.

1699
02:09:04,937 --> 02:09:09,074
CHAPTER TWO, RED.

1700
02:09:09,074 --> 02:09:10,442
I DECIDED I WASN'T GOING TO BE

1701
02:09:10,442 --> 02:09:11,176
MISERABLE ANYMORE.

1702
02:09:11,176 --> 02:09:13,278
I WOKE UP AND I WAS LIKE, YOU

1703
02:09:13,278 --> 02:09:20,552
KNOW, I CAN'T SAY A CURSE WORD.

1704
02:09:20,552 --> 02:09:22,020
I AM A LOT HAPPIER NOW, AND I

1705
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:24,356
WANT TO LET YOU KNOW IF YOU ARE

1706
02:09:24,356 --> 02:09:29,294
STILL IN YOUR CHAPTER ONE BLUE,

1707
02:09:29,294 --> 02:09:31,196
YOUR CHAPTER TWO RED WILL COME.

1708
02:09:31,196 --> 02:09:33,732
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE STILL

1709
02:09:33,732 --> 02:09:34,265
FIXING THIS PROBLEM.

1710
02:09:34,265 --> 02:09:39,004
HERE I AM TALKING TO YOU.

1711
02:09:39,004 --> 02:09:40,972
THE NEXT SONG I'M GOING TO SING

1712
02:09:40,972 --> 02:09:45,944
WAS THE FIRST SONG I WROTE WHEN

1713
02:09:45,944 --> 02:09:47,478
I DECIDED THAT I WASN'T GOING TO

1714
02:09:47,478 --> 02:09:48,847
BE SAD ANYMORE.

1715
02:09:48,847 --> 02:09:51,984
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING AND I WAS

1716
02:09:51,984 --> 02:09:54,152
LIKE, NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO BE

1717
02:09:54,152 --> 02:09:55,954
MY FAN IF I'M NOT MY OWN.

1718
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:57,889
YOU CAN'T RELY ON OTHER PEOPLE

1719
02:09:57,889 --> 02:10:00,225
TO BRING YOU OUT OF DARK TIMES.

1720
02:10:00,225 --> 02:10:01,493
YOU ONLY HAVE YOURSELF.

1721
02:10:01,493 --> 02:10:03,529
THROUGH ALL OF LIFE, YOU WILL

1722
02:10:03,529 --> 02:10:04,096
HAVE PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU AND

1723
02:10:04,096 --> 02:10:05,263
CARE ABOUT YOU AND WILL BE THERE

1724
02:10:05,263 --> 02:10:10,402
FOR YOU, BUT YOU ALWAYS HAVE YO

1725
02:10:10,402 --> 02:10:10,568
YOU.

1726
02:10:10,568 --> 02:10:14,973
SO SOMETIMES YOU'VE GOT TO FORCE

1727
02:10:14,973 --> 02:10:15,606

1728
02:10:15,606 --> 02:10:19,310
IT'S REALLY HARD TO.

1729
02:10:19,310 --> 02:10:20,712
BUT I'M ALSO NOT PREACHING TO

1730
02:10:20,712 --> 02:10:22,280
YOU BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FIGURED

1731
02:10:22,280 --> 02:10:23,982
OUT MY LIFE YET EITHER.

1732
02:10:23,982 --> 02:10:25,516
AND I TAKE IT DAY BY DAY AND I
