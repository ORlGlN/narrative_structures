1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
this is clickbait

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Literally everyone here is blogging

3
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,500
They are just like ''Were at the white house!'' IMMA SLEEP IN IT BRO! I'M SLEEPING IN IT!

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,460
My dream is to visit the White House

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,200
*Yawns*

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,160
Today. Is. The day!

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,540
It's actually a huggeeeeeee day and I have to get ready

8
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,340
Shower. Dressed. Almost ready for today now, Jake!

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,900
What is it that you are doing?

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,500
Why is it such a big day?

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,220
Let me tell you

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,980
So, a couple weeks ago

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,640
The White House emailed me

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,060
And they said ''Yo, Jake, we're having this event with a bunch of influencers-''

15
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,080
''Do you want to come and attend?''

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,660
They said:

17
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,780
Obama is gonna be there

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,660
Michelle Obama

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,320
Joe biden

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,280
Andddddd

21
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,880
You'll get to meet them

22
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:39,980
Video tape with them

23
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,100
All the stuff

24
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,300
So I was like DUH!

25
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,200
But, thennnnn

26
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,200
I was like...

27
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,040
What do I wanna do before I die!

28
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,040
And one of those things is...

29
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,600
Have a sleep over at the white house

30
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,380
So I thought why not

31
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:56,460
Vlog myself doing an overnight challenge at the White House

32
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,680
This is probably my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

33
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,340
Where I will actually be inside of the White House

34
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,800
Where I could go like, in to a bathroom and try and sleep overnight there and then leave in the morning

35
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,420
WOAHHHHHHHHHHH

36
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,420
WOAH

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,340
BRO WHAT IF I ACTUALLY DO THIS

38
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:12,260
Sorry, chair

39
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,940
I'm so sorry

40
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,960
Sorry about that

41
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,440
Jake Paulers I'm going to try my 100% hardest to do this today

42
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,280
I have to be there in two hours.

43
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,520
In the meantime, they told me to dress business attire

44
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,460
And me being the idiot that I am, I brought jeans.

45
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,300
And, like, this shirt.

46
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,860
so I have to go, an, and yeezys as my dress shoes

47
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,660
So, I have to go to the store right now.

48
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,640
And get some business attire clothes.

49
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,180
Jesus, Jake, what were you thinking?

50
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,500
You're going to the White House and you brought Yeezys.

51
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,220
GOD!

52
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,580
All right, Jake Paulers, let's see if we can pull this off today.

53
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,520
If I don't make it out of there, you won't ever know 'cus I'll probably delete this footage.

54
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,680
Let's go get some clothes for the White House.

55
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,060
All right, here at the store.

56
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,600
Let's see what they got for this White House attire.

57
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm so bad at, like, dressing nice.

58
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,920
Yo, my man I need your help!

59
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,420
-What's that?

60
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,740
I'm going to the white house and I need to look fly.

61
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,420
What do you got for me?

62
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,220
You got some fire?

63
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,920
I feel like I need a suitjacket, right?

64
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,820
I think, like, black.

65
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,380
I was gonna wear this. Is that dumb?

66
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:11,940
All right, you guys got me?

67
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,440
-Yeah!

68
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,040
My boy.

69
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,100
My boys got me.

70
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,500
All right, so, they got the hookups. Let me see what I can do.

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,480
WOOHOOHOO!

72
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,100
Ya boy's kinda hot.

73
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,840
Hey, I'm going to cop this,

74
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,020
go get some lunch

75
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,640
and then it's White House time.

76
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,840
Yaaay! All dressed up. Got the 'fit.

77
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,820
We made it work. We pulled it together last-second.

78
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,180
*Agent 007 walks across the street*

79
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,100
How about that suit montage, though?

80
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,760
ok

81
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,480
 

82
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:44,980

Do you know what I want to do today?

86
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you know what this whole video is about

87
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I missed the last one , what is it about

88
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,300
I want to try and sleepover overnight  at the White House

89
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,320
That's not even a thing, *laughs*

90
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,660
Do you think I could sleepover overnight  at the White House

91
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,160
 

92
00:03:01,160 --> 00:00:00,000
