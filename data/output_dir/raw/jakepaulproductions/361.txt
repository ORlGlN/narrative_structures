1
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,000
Yo, that's the dude. Hide, that's the dude

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,500

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
K, I'm gonna go find him

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,180
 

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,420
What's up Jake Paulers you're probably wondering, Jake what are you doing?

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,300
And I'm just like, yo, read the title of the video and look at the thumbnail

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,800
Ericka!

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Oh, haha

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,300
Yo, what's up?

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,080
We've been waiting for you, I missed you so much (I've missed you guys too, what's going on?-)

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,100
Ericka still works here?

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,800
I thought you fired her.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,200
I said mean stuff about her on Twitter 'cause I thought you fired her

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,800
Did you actually tweet about her?

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,160
Yeah, I thought she was gone, bro

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,200
She's working here still?

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,900
She's going on a date with those two kids

19
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Oh, that's right

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,200
Yeah, you are

21
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,000
I am

22
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,280
Aight, watch out for the snake in your bed

23
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,100
Are you serious?

24
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,000
Did you put something in here?

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, yeah there's actually a snake in your bed

26
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,480
Why do you think I'm already filming you right now?

27
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,760
Is there really a snake in the shower?

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,660
No, it's over here,

29
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,160
Shut up

30
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,920
It's under your covers

31
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,640
I'm gonna start locking everything in here... There's nothing in here

32
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,460
get out of my room

33
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,340
She's strong, yo

34
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,300
Yo, what's up?

35
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,320
There's a bunch of random people in my house

36
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,500
so, I'm gonna mess with them

37
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
(laughing)

38
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,040
If you're gonna come into my house, I get to.. spray you with.. What is this called?

39
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,260
A leaf blower?

40
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,480
Alright, have fun guys

41
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,480
I don't know what they're shooting but it's pretty lit

42
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,640
Like I said, it's always lit her at the Team 10 house!

43
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,460
If you're new here, I'm Jake Paul and this is the Jake Paulers!

44
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,420
and we go hard every single flipin' day, bro

45
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,100
Indoor skate park

46
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:31,700
Hit it!

47
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,060
oh!

48
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,560
Weak

49
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:34,960
First try

50
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,920
Oh and um, yes,  that is a good night Jake Paulers

51
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,460
you always know the most savage things on this channel happen at night

52
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,040
You already know what we're about to do 'cause of, again, the title and the thumbnail

53
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,600
So, don't even have to explain it. It's not click-bait!

54
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,940
I used click-bait once

55
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,480
It worked :)

56
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
I feel really bad about it :(

57
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,200
I'll probably use it again in the future

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,700
Y'know

59
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,200
It's Youtube, you gotta do what you gotta do

60
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,760
Typical Youtuber stuff

61
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,140
This one's not clickbait we're gonna-

62
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,440
Again, I don't even have to explain it

63
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,680
You already know what we're going to do

64
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,180
Jake,

65
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,160
get out of your house

66
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,140
okay

67
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,080
I am trying  to shoot

68
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,420
get out, get out!

69
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,880
Okay, I'm getting kicked out of my own house

70
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,720
And I'm about to get kicked out of some pools

71
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,260
Get out!

72
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:11,760
Okay, bye!

73
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,260
Get out!

74
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,760
Okay

75
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Yeah, well

76
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,260
Umm

77
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,000
We're out here now

78
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,720
So...

79
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,260
Jake!

80
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,320
Okay!

81
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,960
I'm leaving!

82
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,660
Rude!

83
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,320
Chad,

84
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
Jesus, Jesus, geez, geez

85
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,860
Cade,

86
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,720
Thank you, get out!

87
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,220
Bye

88
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,360
Are you ready to do this?

89
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,540
It's cold, bro

90
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,700
The pools are heated, it's fancy hotels

91
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,500
It's fancy hotels

92
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,240
Who's car is that?

93
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
It's nice

94
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,580
Let's go

95
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,440
Shotgun!

96
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,240
