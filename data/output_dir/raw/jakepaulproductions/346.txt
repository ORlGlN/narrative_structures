1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,920
Hey did you know about this

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,900
-No I didn't, I didn't.
-I thought we were friends

3
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:03,740
I didn't! I didn't know about it!

4
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,560
*intro slam*

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,700
*intro music*

6
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,560
Good morning Jack Paulers! What is popping?

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,820
Starting the vlog a little bit early right now

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,920
Becauaaase, this morning

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,360
Erica asked me if she could go up onto my roof to tan

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,880
Because it's such a nice day out

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,180
And then we were talking

12
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,940
And we were like "Yo what do we want to do today"

13
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,860
And then they were like "Oh isn't Erica on the roof tanning"

14
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,280
And we've like thrown water on people tanning at our house before

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,540
So, we had this really big bucket

16
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,020
-Giant
-Giant bucket

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,680
So we're going to take it up this ladder somehow

18
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,820
I don't know how we're going to get up the ladder to be honest

19
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,320
But once we're up there,

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,660
It should be like hilarious

21
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,100
-Yeah 'cause she like jams music when she's up there

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,040
Yeah, so it's like she's not even gonna hear it

23
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,800
Look at it

24
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,200
I don't know how we're going to get

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,980
The big bucket of water up here

26
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,400
[Whispers] But look- look, look

27
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,260
[Continues whispering] It's literally perfect

28
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:55,760
crazy

29
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,620
Let's fill up the water

30
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,100
Don't vlog and ladder kids

31
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,180
Also Jake Paulers,

32
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,700
I hope you have a great day today

33
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,420
You guys are awesome, work hard

34
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:05,580
Smile, and don't let anyone tell you you can't do things because you can.

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,940
Follow your dreams

36
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,480
And let's do this thang.

37
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,400
[Water running]
[People talking]

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,900
Yo, she's gonna be so mad at us.

39
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,720
[Undistinguishable]
-Dude, she's gonna be so pissed

40
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,680
Especially like, you purposely put cold water in that like

41
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,680
Nobody's safe.

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,440
Prank wars, is lit.

43
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,140
I like just climbed up the ladder though

44
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,960
And I don't know how we're going to get it up there

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,820
-Someone's going to have to hold it from the bottom

46
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,200
-It's going to be like a train type thing

47
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,600
*crickets*

48
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,820
[Laughing]

49
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,960
[Jake grunts]
Ohh it's heavy!

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,220
Do you want to go first up?

51
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,060
[Heavy breath out]

52
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,580
-I think Caid goes first up
-Yeah

53
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,380
Then we'll try and carry it up

54
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,700
As quietly as possible
-Yeah

55
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,940
She had her headphones on but

56
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,600
-Did she hear you when you went up there to check her out
-No, HAHAHAHA

57
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,660
She's like jamming

58
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:43,680
[Laughing]

59
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,180
Raindrops

60
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:44,680
I had a virus on my pc without knowing!  -Yeah i had that last night when streaming call of duty black ops 3

61
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,860
-It's going to be a little more than a rain drop

62
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,280
Alright guys I'm about to go up first

63
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,340
*climbing*

64
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,540
This thing is so heavy, how are they going to do this?

65
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,760
-There we go.
-Yeah, like let go.

66
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,720
Yeah, that's it.

67
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,300
*whispering* So sketchy

68
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,020
*still whispering*
Her head is facing this way so

69
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,240
We gotta move back

70
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,820
*whispers*
Chair

71
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,340
*still whispering*
Jake Paulers it's every day bro

72
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:27,620
*even more suspense*

73
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,120
There it goooes!!!

74
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,700
*huge scream*

75
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,120
Are you guys *censor* serious?

76
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,880
Where we go?

77
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,060
Where are we going?

78
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,560
You guys! My phone is right there!

79
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,220
-It's a seven!
-No
-No it's not!

80
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
-It's a seven!
-No it's not!

81
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,820
-Hey, did you know about this?
-No, I didn't-

82
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,700
I thought we were friends

83
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,660
I didn't know about this, I'm just a filmer

84
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,700
I'm just a filmer!

85
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,800
Your phone's waterproof!

86
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,680
Not it's not!

87
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,700
Yeah it is, it's a seven.

88
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,060
-No it's not.
-Sevens are waterproof, right?

89
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,740
I swear to god, I'm gonna kill all of you while you're sleeping.

90
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,540
I lock my door at night.

91
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,540
-I made the corridor your door.
-Ok

92
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,820
Well, that puts me in a bad position

93
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:16,040
*sounds of Erica fighting off the boys*

94
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,200
Get the weapon!

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,100
I got the weapon!

96
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,240
Now she can't do anything.

97
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,780
Now she's just a girl in a bikini, she's still very dangerous

98
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,800
No, no, it's over!

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,460
You'll just have to get us back another day!

100
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,440
Bye Erica!

101
00:03:25,440 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
