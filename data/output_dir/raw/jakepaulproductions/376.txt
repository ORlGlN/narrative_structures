27
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,720

Lookit! This guys here, he's gonna interview us about the olympic thingy

29
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,500
This doesn't make any sense to me

30
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,860
We're gonna race Usain Bolt.

31
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,080
We're three years out bro,

32
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,540
we got a lot of training to do.

33
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, yeah we should probably train before we do that.

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
By the way, like I don't want to be mean

35
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,620
but I think this hat looks better on me.

36
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,120
It does.

37
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,740

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,340

Whats up Jake Paulers?

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,740
As you guys know, I've been testing out new vlogging setups.

43
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,500
Yo, what are you doing?

44
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,360
This is my new vlogging setup.

45
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,500
Oh you're going going 2 cameras with it?

46
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,040

00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,440
I'm gonna carry this around.

48
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,000
Okay well, as one vlogger to another,

49
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500
not the best idea.

50
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,080
I'm trying to test up new vlog setups.

51
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,000
I think all of these are just no good.

52
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,980
I'm gonna help you out here and say

53
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000

Oh ok I'm sorry.

55
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,480
This could actually be like a sick vlog camera.

56
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,720
Are you joking?

57
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,040
No, I'm serious cause look

58
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:41,700

00:01:48,165 --> 00:01:49,300
I'm not gonna break it.

66
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,300
It's mine anyways.

67
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,315
Could you pull this off the slider?

68
00:01:51,315 --> 00:01:52,500
I just want to hold it.

69
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,100

70
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,800
Yeah. I mean it's my camera so..

71
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,800

79
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,980
