00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,869
chops to come on down I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I can</font>

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,220
put it on something I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what is</font>

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,509
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep I can put it on something</font>

30
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:18,180
and make that thing look really cute and

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,080
it's like a really dusty pink kind of

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,220
color and that was 150 I also got these

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,869
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas because I've seen them and</font>

34
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,360
I've seen them around a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently on</font>

35
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,829
everyone's channels and blogs and stuff

36
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,680
from Primark and they look like that

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,369
feathers but these stones that make them

38
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:40,500
look really cheap I think we'll cheaper

39
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,500
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to just take this stone</font>

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,640
detail off and like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it</font>

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,700
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be the quarry see but the</font>

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,399
feather see like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah I think I</font>

43
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,680

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,399
nice what else did I get oh I got these

45
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,280
because I be recommended<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and they</font>

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,750
basically just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like firm control firm</font>

47
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,790
control for your

48
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,719
like you know your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hips waist your hips</font>

49
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:20,000
waist and<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Harley they shrink you</font>

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,890
down like an image<font color="#E5E5E5"> feels like i'm going</font>

51
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try them and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was only four</font>

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,019
pounds which is quite a bargain so from

53
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Topshop I bought I bought some underwear</font>

54
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,780
but let's see i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

55
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,629
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my underwear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about you one thing</font>

56
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,480
but it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> on sale so and grabbed it i</font>

57
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,260
bought this hot which is actually kind

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,519
of i<font color="#CCCCCC"> forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

59
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,250
like this and there was a few of these

60
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,159
but this is the only one in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> size</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

61
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:53,870
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> way because it doesn't look like a</font>

62
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,840
bra top but it was in like the bra kind

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,030
of section then and it was reduced from

64
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,470
22 pounds to 10 pounds so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought that</font>

65
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">was really good and i can wear this</font>

66
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,220
underneath like that's hot you know like

67
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">a t-shirt when the sides are quite low</font>

68
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,599
and i think that will look quite nice

69
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,829
because it's not just quite pretty and

70
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:18,919
and I've got this just<font color="#E5E5E5"> plain black top</font>

71
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:21,829
because I love God laptops it's slightly

72
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:24,260
sure but its not see through like well

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:29,780
it looks if it's just like this it's

74
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,409
nice and this was 12 pounds they went

75
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:36,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pounds so that's cool so</font>

76
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,500
caught these flats which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've had my</font>

77
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,139
eyes on for a while and then when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw</font>

78
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,879
them in the said I was like getting them

79
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:45,620
because i always put off getting them

80
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,690
because i don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend like like</font>

81
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,760
they used to be 28 pounds like i'm not

82
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,859
spending 28 pounds of fluff they look

83
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,930
like this they're just black and the

84
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,900
tips of them and metal so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

85
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,919
cool so they reduced a 15 pounds so yeah

86
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,930
although came over 15 pounds or like not

87
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,859
28<font color="#E5E5E5"> pounds no but 50 counts is cool</font>

88
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,569
though yeah i got those this job just is

89
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,889
red and it's quite oversized but it

90
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,269
looks really nice that when I hope when

91
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:19,699
I held up you look very nice and it's

92
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,349
quite thick and it's just perfect for

93
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:23,599
winter and I don't wear red a lot so I

94
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,570
for quite different Phoenix I don't wear

95
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:27,560
red<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much</font>

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,540
but it's a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and it used to be</font>

97
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,169
25<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was reduced to 12 oh they have</font>

98
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:36,350
