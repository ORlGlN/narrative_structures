00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:53,969
morning and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> first I was overwhelmed</font>

50
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:55,740
because it was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

51
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,379
their lot of stores and wasn't really

52
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:00,179
sure what I should be looking at I saw a

53
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:02,009
glimpse of pixie the pizza we girls I

54
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:05,729
got really shine excited and then they

55
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:08,429
were leaving so I actually kind of right

56
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,800
staff to Sam and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was like hi I really</font>

57
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,439
love your channel and anyway and I saw

58
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,289
Tanya from pics eat way but um I wasn't

59
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:17,999
able to let's say hi to her because it

60
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,559
doesn't know just everything was

61
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:22,199
happening so fast so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

62
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">around and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I because it was so</font>

63
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,800
stressed on so overwhelming it wasn't

64
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,959
sure what to buy from what you know what

65
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:30,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">to buy and so I ended up getting some a</font>

66
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,579
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac and something from</font>

67
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,740
Illamasqua<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kinda wanted to get some</font>

68
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,400
crown brushes but I can do

69
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,949
q I also wanted to get something from

70
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">make up forever but I didn't get round</font>

71
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,300
to it and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even know that was a</font>

72
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,979
Knicks store there I really would love

73
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:46,990
something from Nick so basically I'm

74
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,669
really bad at explaining myself but it

75
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,300
was it was a good experience but it

76
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,430
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> as like amazing as I thought I</font>

77
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,460
feel like it's been hyped up so much and

78
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,139
i felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the place was actually quite</font>

79
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,910
smaller when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was in there but it's</font>

80
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,740
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's so much so many</font>

81
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,570
stores in one area with<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

82
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite claustrophobic and</font>

83
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:10,720
but the like the lives makeup and

84
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,130
painting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like that that was</font>

85
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,680
going almost amazing that was stunning

86
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then I've got some of it in the</font>

87
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,880
video so you already saw that unless

88
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,020
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and you really know what</font>

89
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,289
you want to get and stuff like that I

90
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:25,720
think the price for the ticket is like a

91
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,580
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I don't think it was worth</font>

92
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,520
it for what I went for you know but you

93
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,990
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get there early you really</font>

94
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,820
get your money's worth you see all the

95
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,380
talks and everything I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is worth</font>

96
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,020
it not sure if I'll go next year

97
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,719
probably will cuz why then I'll probably

98
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,110
want to go again but anyway enough of me

99
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,990
babbling and I didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that much</font>

100
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,490
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be honest from marc and on the</font>

101
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,220
queue at<font color="#CCCCCC"> mac was ridiculous it babe it</font>

102
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:57,100
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like can properly I mean I feel</font>

103
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it wasn't planned properly and I</font>

104
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,370
was so confused I didn't know where to

105
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,890
go to pay for it anyway um I got peachy

106
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,680
keen blush Oh which looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and</font>

107
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">went on at the moment before he can't</font>

108
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,709
see it's like obviously a peachy pinky

109
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,480
kind of color and yeah but then I've got

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,839
home and then I looked at peachy keen I

111
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,839
just like realize that it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

112
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,410
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> coralista from benefit they are so</font>

113
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,720
similar in like if you see them kiss d

114
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,910
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think maybe peachy keens a tiny</font>

115
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,220
bit Pinker and they do go on differently

116
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,400
but they are very similar I also got

117
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,870
this blush palette because I really

118
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,079
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> blush palette</font>

119
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,360
but to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest with you we went to Mac</font>

120
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,759
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> after I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maps and that's why I</font>

121
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,160
picked up much this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in actual</font>

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">imax I just got the blur and I got this</font>
