00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I thought I'd heed the</font>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,339
advice for my teenage self tag I saw

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,319
said it falls do this and I thought it

4
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked like a like a fun tag to do and</font>

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,830
it's like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit different so the</font>

6
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,980
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is 03 makeup / fashion</font>

7
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,400
do's your teenage self I want jeans a

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,560
lot more when I was a teenager so that's

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,060
probably a<font color="#CCCCCC"> do because like jeans never</font>

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">really go out fashion and I do remember</font>

11
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,699
flares being involved at some point but

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:30,720
I think that's when I was a little bit

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,030
younger<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a teenager and that's all</font>

14
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:35,880
right but yeah a makeup thing maybe I

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't remember my makeup being too bad</font>

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,450
like being too um out there or looking

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,610
bad or not matching me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I've</font>

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,050
done a pretty good job<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like matching</font>

19
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,329
my foundation to my skin<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth so</font>

20
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,539
probably say yeah like my makeup was ok

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,079
what else for my teenage self with he

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,570
