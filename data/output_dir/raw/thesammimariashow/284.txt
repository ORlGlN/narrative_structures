00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,930
hi felan<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope you're all well so I</font>

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,630
haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a semi stuff for a while</font>

3
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,860
because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of been stalking a rock</font>

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,769
to be honest and i will just wasn't like

5
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,750
wearing anything that I felt was decent

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,340
enough to show in a way and yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I just I've been like really not in</font>

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,080
a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion frame of mind if that</font>

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,990
makes any sense but today today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

10
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,359
is going to be like kind of less than

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,120
going out and outfits<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really</font>

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,739
doing too much today well it's kind of

13
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,090
like I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clothes</font>

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,770
everything because I recently went back

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,260
home I picked out some things to bring

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,780
to the place so I had more clothes here

17
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,629
and in doing so I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> some more</font>

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:48,000
clothes of mine that like I forgot about

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,660
and that I liked anyway so I'm going to

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">do a blog post on this look so check my</font>

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,989
blog out for the post of this but i

22
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:57,510
thought i'd also show it in a video so I

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,120
hope you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously look looks</font>

24
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,129
quite dressy because of the shoes but

25
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,539
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you after how you can</font>

26
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,769
dress it down because it is quite a

27
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,810
simple look and recently I've just been

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,310
feeling really simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't really</font>

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,990
been going overboard with my start or

30
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:12,119
anything so and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:13,409
it's been really hot and muggy if you

32
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,259
came free with weapons<font color="#CCCCCC"> ride wrestle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

33
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,439

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,960

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,510

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,920
warm in the UK at the moment and then my

44
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,420
rings like I'm actually really excited
