that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah that was quite quite a good</font>

76
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,750
piece of advice I think another piece of

77
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,030
advice was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember always room my</font>

78
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,920
aunt said this and we were talking about

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like wearing stuff like</font>

80
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,269
clothes and stuff like that and she she

81
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,310
said that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> see from a from the</font>

82
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">back just as much as they see from the</font>

83
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,840
front so like think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you look</font>

84
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,450
from the back as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess that</font>

85
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,920
kind of sounds weird but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

86
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,110
stuck in my head so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

87
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,519
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I look from behind like if</font>

88
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:36,350
things fit well from behind as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

89
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,840
look you know fit well and look good

90
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,730
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> front tons of other things I've</font>

91
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">been told but they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a few that</font>

92
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,109
stuck in my mind christy<font color="#CCCCCC"> is cool asked</font>

93
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,730
if you could have one wish granted for

94
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,900
everyone in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world what would it be</font>

95
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,760
what is the most attractive quality in a

96
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,730
person so for the first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

97
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,519
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard I'd say happiness but</font>

98
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,709
that's kind of I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happiness</font>

99
00:03:57,709 --> 00:03:59,450
for everyone but I think good health is

100
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you can like live a</font>

101
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,850
long and healthy life so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

102
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,250
anyone had any health issues or anything

103
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,620
like that then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have their</font>

104
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,299
wish granted in the way of being healthy

105
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,769
again I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help a lot of</font>

106
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">people more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money and stuff like</font>

107
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,209
that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be healthy and be able to</font>

108
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everything you want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

109
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,140
most attractive quality in a person I

110
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,700
love if someone has a good sense of

111
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,240
humor but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

112
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,819
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone is caring I think if</font>

113
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:28,889
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is caring and cares about you</font>

114
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,229
that's like the nicest feeling and I

115
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,259
like I like caring about others and I

116
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:36,780
like to be cared about so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a</font>

117
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,610
really lovely quality for someone to

118
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,560
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this one I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read I</font>

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,270
need to hold and read because it's quite

120
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,759
long anonymous asked what should I do if

121
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,069
I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning at high school I sit</font>

122
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:49,319
by myself for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my lessons and I</font>

123
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,449
feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like crying all the time my bffs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

124
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,729
had turned away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and now they</font>

125
00:04:53,729 --> 00:04:55,680
ignore everything I say and don't

126
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,659
interact with me at all I feel depressed

127
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,099
and I don't want to go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> school anymore</font>

128
00:04:59,099 --> 00:05:01,020
I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're laughing at me all</font>

129
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,370
the freaking time and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what</font>

130
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only High School in my</font>

131
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,180
town please tell me give me advice on

132
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,979
death row I'm really really sorry that

133
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have to feel that way at school I I</font>

134
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,169
read I don't like school ads when I was

135
00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:16,229
at school and so if you're really lonely

136
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,759
I would suggest if you fill out those

137
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,229
people are laughing at you and things

138
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:23,759
like that I know it must be really

139
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,650
really hard but you honestly how to just

140
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,419
look if they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice people so you</font>

141
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:28,830
have to just lock them out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your head</font>

142
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,169
and if they're sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> there laughing at</font>

143
00:05:31,169 --> 00:05:33,000
you how sad is that for them that that's

144
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,009
all they're doing with their time like

145
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:37,469
they're actually like they're using

146
00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:39,210
their time on you so that's kind of

147
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,130
laughable so them not to be nice people

148
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,840
anyway so just scrap them out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

149
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,919
head you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need to worry about</font>

150
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,389
people laughing at your things like that

151
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:49,560
people people just suck it sometimes um

152
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,800
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone at school loads on my</font>

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,539

160
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,020
have time on your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> so find things to</font>

162
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,250
things like that like<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading or working</font>

163

people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love to be friends of you</font>

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,469
and I know sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it use it seems</font>

168
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:32,699
like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't because they're</font>

169
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,750
already in there

170
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,050
in groups but just try to like make

171
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,330
casual conversation with other other

172
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,090
people like new people people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

have like clicked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> before in the</font>

174
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,010
past but know also that school goes by

175
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,570
so quickly so you're not you won't

176
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,850
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in that situation even if you</font>

177
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,650
don't talk don't get to talk to others

178
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:56,130
and you find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that difficult the time</font>

179
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:58,950
just goes so quickly so all I say to

180
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,590
people and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> family like small people</font>

184
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,700
suck if you're on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own I know that</font>

185
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,900
myself but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just have to find you</font>

186
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,250
have to like find things to do if your

187
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,410
time and like distract yourself from

188
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,180
worrying about people and things like

189
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,160
that it's hard to go really<font color="#E5E5E5"> into detail</font>

235
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:14,399
picture and look at just life itself and

236
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a big issue like in</font>

237
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">the grand scheme of things like when I'm</font>

talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people I always say like look</font>

239
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,399

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,709
big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I always think of it that</font>

deal and I just try not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stress over</font>

247
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,720
things because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> life's life's too</font>

251
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,470

252
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,700
perspective and deal with issues more
