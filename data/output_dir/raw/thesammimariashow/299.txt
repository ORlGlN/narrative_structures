things but I think one of the most

87

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting things was when they were</font>

88
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,830
talking about hair dyes and how they're

89
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,120
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> always trying to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

ways to make the<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience of dying</font>

91
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,680
your hair better and how long it takes

92
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,330
to do research and it kind of takes

93
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,790
short it can take years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what else</font>

94
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,950
there was it really the one of the first

95
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,750
bits you went home was to do with

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,360
afro-caribbean hair and also like asian

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,460

98
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,930
we saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different types of hair</font>

99
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,450

105
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">and like some people went up and touched</font>
