9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,410
other stuff but start with fashion you

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:26,699
have shown these before I'm not sure

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:29,429

13
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">misguided I think they're quite</font>

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,070
affordable compared to a lot of the

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">other Chloe knockoffs like the zara ones</font>

16

17
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,230
attention people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are looking at my feet</font>

18
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,030
when I wear these and people ask the

19
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,290
little questions about them and stuff

20
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,719

29
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,500
lovely piece because it sets off an

Miguel Azealia Banks 1991 and oh I've

44
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,060
been loving Drake and dawn Richard where

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,909
where were you that's such a good song

46
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,509
and poetic justice by Kendrick Lamar and

47
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:51,540
Drake so I'm just reading off my phone

48
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,920
because I've got like they're all in

49
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,570
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> added yeah I think that's all</font>

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,799
of the songs and films are film actually

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we got recently and I watched it</font>

52
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,119
for the second time around and I love it

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,860
as such it's like one of my favorite

54
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,110
films of the years prometheus I know

55
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,940
most of you probably really seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> it its</font>

56
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,520
kind

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,770
end of its not officially the prequel to

58
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:14,530
alien but it's kind of an idea for what

59
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,360
could be the prequels alien and it makes

60
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,460
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense kind of thing and it's</font>

61
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,260
just such a good film is directed by

62
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,700
ridley scott who directed alien and yeah

63
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,270
I really like sci-fi actually so i'm

64
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,070
quite a fan of it but even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're not</font>

65
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:31,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fan of sci-fi just watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font>

66
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,600
it's such a good film food and drinks

67
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,890
that I've been like in it's not that

68
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,350
been really really into cooking I think

69
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,480
since I've tried to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,030
healthier and everything I've been

71
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,500
cooking a lot more like cooking my own

72
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,690
food and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything sorry i was in</font>

73
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,610
everything if that makes sense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

74
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:51,760
just a lot healthier and I was actually

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,310
I got this book which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just classic</font>

76
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,350
vegetarian recipes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made a few things</font>

77
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">in here i made the stuffed peppers and</font>

78
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:01,120
ah it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so good it has loads and</font>

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,030
loads of good recipes in here and quite

80
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,890
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things aren't just crazy</font>

81
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,810
ingredients that you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like never find</font>

82
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,490
which is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so many other</font>

83
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,350
cookbooks but this one's quite

84
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,650
achievable in a lot more entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

85
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a little bit colder</font>

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,800
I've been more drinking more tea and

87
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,080
experimenting with more tea I'm very

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,810
very picky of tea I don't like it not I

89
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,340
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it to taste horrible or not</font>

90
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,980
to taste of anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I love kind of</font>

91
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,490
spices<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like spicy tea not in a hot</font>

92
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">spice laid but like cinnamon so I tried</font>

93
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,900
this out I didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

94
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,640
actually be as good<font color="#CCCCCC"> as it is and it's</font>

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,900
the yogi tea classic cinnamon spice it's

96
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,540

99
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,880
it actually tasted a bit like chai tea

100
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,300
like oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also add like a tiny bit of</font>

101
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,700
brown sugar or just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little tiny bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

102
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,040
honey to it to give it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sweetness as</font>

103
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,410
well but i really recommend this tea

104
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,990

105
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,880
