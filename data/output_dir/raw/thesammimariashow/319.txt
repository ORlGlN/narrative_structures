77
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,630

79
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,450
I've got the lip gloss<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at the moment</font>

80
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I've already opened it and stuff but</font>

81
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,860

82
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,560
really small but the color is really

83
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,770
intense and as I was putting it all I've

84
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,150
got it on now and I put it on in the

85
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,500
camera then when I looked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mirror</font>

86
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,510
it's so dark like it's darker than it

87
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,480
looks on camera<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just really it is a</font>

88
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,820
really intense lip gloss but it is take

89
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,640
a bit of fiddling about with it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

90
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,460
real smooth finish but it's really

91
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,290
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice so that's one of the new</font>

92

98
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,330

99
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">ones and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they're in the original</font>
