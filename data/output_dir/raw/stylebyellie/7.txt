1
00:00:00,755 --> 00:00:01,968
(grunts)

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:02,810
(screams)

3
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,048
- [Woman] It's on your nose!

4
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:04,938
- I got it!

5
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,566
- It tastes like jello.

6
00:00:06,566 --> 00:00:08,816
(laughter)

7
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,969
- [Woman] 26 weeks today!

8
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:14,259
- Good morning boys, how are you?

9
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:15,575
- Good.
- Good.

10
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:16,408
- Good, did you sleep good?

11
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:17,241
- Yeah.

12
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:18,074
- Yeah.

13
00:00:18,074 --> 00:00:20,281
- Okay, we have to go to school today.

14
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,114
- Okay.

15
00:00:21,114 --> 00:00:21,947
- Okay.

16
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:23,280
- And we have to finish getting ready.

17
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,015
Jackson, you look so
handsome with your hair done.

18
00:00:25,015 --> 00:00:26,682
We have to go brush our teeth.

19
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:27,515
- Okay!

20
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:29,044
- But, Mommy is asleep.

21
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:29,953
- Yeah.

22
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:32,820
- So we have to go and walk so quietly

23
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,669
into Mommy's room and into Mommy
and Daddy's bathroom, okay?

24
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,417
So, will you guys walk so quietly with me?

25
00:00:39,417 --> 00:00:40,425
- Yeah.

26
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,258
- Yeah.

27
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:44,591
- Will you show me how you walk quietly.

28
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,136
I think I've taught them well.

29
00:00:48,136 --> 00:00:48,969
Let's go.

30
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:50,137
Good job, okay, let's go.

31
00:00:50,137 --> 00:00:51,626
So quiet.

32
00:00:51,626 --> 00:00:52,459
So quiet.

33
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,783
Good job.

34
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:01,454
(quirky music)

35
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:05,310
You guys did it!

36
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,977
Good job, thumbs up!

37
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:09,082
(silly noise)

38
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:11,665
(guitar music)

39
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:19,844
- Ah!

40
00:01:19,844 --> 00:01:20,781
- Ah!

41
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,160
- [Man] Just like we walked in,

42
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,358
we have to walk out so quietly, okay?

43
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:28,775
Show me how you walk quietly.

44
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:34,214
Let's go, so quietly.

45
00:01:35,943 --> 00:01:38,062
Oh, you gotta get your dog, that's goood.

46
00:01:38,062 --> 00:01:38,895
Let's go.

47
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,166
(quirky music)

48
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,083
So quietly.

49
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:47,807
Yes!

50
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,484
- Yes!

51
00:01:50,934 --> 00:01:51,808
- We did it!

52
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:53,841
- [Woman] Peek-a-boo!

53
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,329
Peek-a-boo!

54
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,936
I'm already playing peek-a-boo!

55
00:01:57,936 --> 00:01:59,186
26 weeks today.

56
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:01,445
- Hi.

57
00:02:01,445 --> 00:02:02,334
- I'm 26 weeks!

58
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:04,772
- And you're 26 years!

59
00:02:04,772 --> 00:02:06,707
- I'm 26 years old, 26 weeks pregnant.

60
00:02:06,707 --> 00:02:07,540
Holy moly.

61
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:12,346
You wanna know what my app says?

62
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:14,729
"Baby is messing with your brain."

63
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:15,562
(chuckles)

64
00:02:15,562 --> 00:02:17,764
- [Man] Baby is messing with your brain?

65
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:20,459
- "It may even be giving you
stress headaches or two."

66
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:21,292
(man laughs)

67
00:02:21,292 --> 00:02:22,625
- What the heck.

68
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:24,749
(laughs)

69
00:02:24,749 --> 00:02:29,582
I am 26 weeks along and I've
kinda taken the last few days

70
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:32,871
off of social media a little bit

71
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:35,380
and I've kinda just stayed low.

72
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:38,570
And my app says for
this week for the baby,

73
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,237
Baby M is one pound!

74
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:46,522
Baby is a pound and the size of kale.

75
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:48,579
Baby's eyes are forming, and he's going to

76
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,009
start opening up his eyes soon.

77
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,429
This week has probably
been the hardest week.

78
00:02:53,429 --> 00:02:56,512
My anxiety has completely taken over.

79
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,466
Like, I swear if I could just take

80
00:03:00,466 --> 00:03:03,494
my brain out of my
head, I would be better.

81
00:03:03,494 --> 00:03:05,213
But, my anxiety is through the roof.

82
00:03:05,213 --> 00:03:09,464
I woke up a few days ago
with rashes right here

83
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,435
because I've been crying so hard.

84
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,501
It's just been... my anxiety
has been really rough.

85
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:18,008
But I'm 26 weeks and baby is growing.

86
00:03:18,008 --> 00:03:20,774
If I can get a hold of my brain,

87
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:23,081
I'll start to feel a little bit better,

88
00:03:23,081 --> 00:03:25,756
so that's my goal this
week, is to just breathe

89
00:03:25,756 --> 00:03:28,018
and to just really feel better.

90
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,373
How was school, mister?

91
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:30,206
- Good.

92
00:03:30,206 --> 00:03:31,926
- It was good?

93
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:34,188
- You know which number of gems I have?

94
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:35,191
- How many?

95
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:37,595
- Nine, and I have one last gem.

96
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:38,775
- Yes!

97
00:03:38,775 --> 00:03:40,886
He's been waiting to get 10 gems!

98
00:03:40,886 --> 00:03:42,027
- [Jackson] Yes!

99
00:03:42,027 --> 00:03:42,953
- Come here.

100
00:03:42,953 --> 00:03:44,721
Did you bring your rock to show and tell?

101
00:03:44,721 --> 00:03:45,886
Did they like it?

102
00:03:45,886 --> 00:03:47,925
- The one I broke.

103
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:49,024
- The one you broke?

104
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:50,163
You know what?

105
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,426
- And the shark one.

106
00:03:51,426 --> 00:03:52,688
- [Woman] Oh, good, the shark one?

107
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:53,521
Good.

108
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,385
You look different today.

109
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,851
Look at your face.

110
00:03:56,851 --> 00:04:00,775
Did you know, I just bought
Jackson a pair of 5T pants.

111
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,025
- That's crazy.

112
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:04,950
- I, like, cried.

113
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,174
I was like what the heck.

114
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,507
- Speaking of crying, I felt so bad today.

115
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,214
So Jackson and I were getting dressed.

116
00:04:10,214 --> 00:04:11,047
- Oh yeah, I was just
going to tell you this.

117
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,026
- And he was brushing
his teeth and everything,

118
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,512
and I was brushing my teeth,

119
00:04:14,512 --> 00:04:16,930
and he had his precious little rock.

120
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,142
It's like one of those gem
rocks that are see through.

121
00:04:20,142 --> 00:04:20,975
I can't remember..

122
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,071
- That we got in Moab.

123
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,200
They're really fragile.

124
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,291
- And he dropped it in our bathroom,

125
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:26,852
and it broke into three pieces.

126
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:28,019
And he just was...

127
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:28,995
- Wept.

128
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:32,490
- ...so sad about it, and we felt so bad.

129
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,707
- Our kids cry, they're
toddlers, they get frustrated.

130
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:40,766
They have some tantrums, but not often.

131
00:04:40,766 --> 00:04:44,268
It really is rare that
Jackson will really cry.

132
00:04:44,268 --> 00:04:47,868
And it was like his heart was
broke that his rock broke.

133
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:50,297
- Yeah. It was a different cry.

134
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,130
- We felt so bad

135
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,659
We all just sat on the floor.

136
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,636
We all kissed him, like "It's okay."

137
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:56,877
It hurt his feelings.

138
00:04:56,877 --> 00:04:59,813
- It was almost like you lose your puppy.

139
00:04:59,813 --> 00:05:01,827
He was like, "My rock!"

140
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,033
- He was heart broken.

141
00:05:03,033 --> 00:05:06,140
But he was okay bringing it home.

142
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,098
Now you're good, Mister?

143
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:10,629
You're happy about your rock?

144
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:13,670
Yeah, we're playing with playdoh.

145
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,512
And I am making a handful of recipes today

146
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,945
for our family cookbook, so it's all done.

147
00:05:18,945 --> 00:05:20,411
Photo shoots are done.

148
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,653
We have one last full family photo shoot,

149
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:23,953
but recipes are done.

150
00:05:23,953 --> 00:05:26,393
So everyone's in charge of ten recipes.

151
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,818
We're making them, double checking them.

152
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:31,082
- I think there's been a lot of people

153
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:32,122
asking when it's coming out.

154
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:32,955
- Fall.

155
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:36,344
- Yeah, this fall is when
we're tentatively releasing it,

156
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:37,471
but we'll keep you posted on all that.

157
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,410
- Grandma's meatloaf.

158
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,219
That's what I'm in charge of today.

159
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,069
- And the best part is we get to

160
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:44,679
eat all of it once it's done.

161
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:45,512
- I know, We're eating pork and beans,

162
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,929
meatloaf, and a desert today.

163
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,092
(quirky music)

164
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:04,644
(grunts)

165
00:06:04,644 --> 00:06:05,477
(screams)

166
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:06,856
- [Woman] It's on your nose!

167
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:07,769
- I got it!

168
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,382
Yeah! (laughs)

169
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:12,265
- Alright, my cooking job is done.

170
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:14,565
We've got my dad's bacon pork beans.

171
00:06:14,565 --> 00:06:16,126
That is done.

172
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,065
And we've got my grandma's
meatloaf that I have made.

173
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,124
And I've given it an a-okay.

174
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:24,324
- Oh, I am so gonna eat these.

175
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,262
(sniffs)

176
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:27,920
- I cooked this a little
longer on accident.

177
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,149
- Sometimes when you have crispy edges

178
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:33,114
and just a touch of burnt
tops and stuff, it's the best.

179
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:35,762
Like burnt lasagna is my favorite.

180
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,595
- Oh, yeah, same.

181
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:38,034
- Same thing with
meatloaf, don't you think?

182
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:40,553
Even steak! (laugh)

183
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,386
- Why are you so cute?

184
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:47,350
- I would never have a
burned steak like that.

185
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,183
That's disgusting.

186
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,016
- Good.

187
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,386
- That's blasphemous.

188
00:06:50,386 --> 00:06:51,938
- Each kid has to take at least a bite.

189
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:52,771
- This is lunch.

190
00:06:52,771 --> 00:06:54,479
- [Man] And Calvin is
wanting to spit it out.

191
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,633
- We have to take one bite.

192
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,942
Jackson ate all of his.

193
00:06:58,942 --> 00:06:59,862
(whines)

194
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:01,160
- [Man] Don't you run away.

195
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,314
- He wants to spit it out.

196
00:07:02,314 --> 00:07:05,397
Look, look, I want you to chew it up.

197
00:07:07,128 --> 00:07:08,448
It's in his mouth.

198
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:11,672
- [Man] You will not spit it
out into the paper towels, no.

199
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,406
Sorry young man.

200
00:07:13,406 --> 00:07:15,562
- Every household is so different.

201
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:18,762
I don't know if some people
are going to love or hate that,

202
00:07:18,762 --> 00:07:21,417
but in our house, if Mom
makes lunch or dinner,

203
00:07:21,417 --> 00:07:22,820
that's what's for lunch or dinner.

204
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,144
And so he has to have at least one bite.

205
00:07:25,144 --> 00:07:26,286
At least one.

206
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:28,389
Jackson did not really want the meatloaf,

207
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:29,879
but it did eat all of his beans.

208
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,687
So, I'm happy there.

209
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,673
- You are almost done!

210
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:36,031
You poured all that in for me, thank you.

211
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,694
Did you eat it?

212
00:07:37,694 --> 00:07:39,114
- Um, nope.

213
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:39,947
- No?

214
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:41,530
- I drank my chalk.

215
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,084
Huh, watch Chase.

216
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,434
- He drank his chalk
and he's walking Chase.

217
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:49,318
You did talk one bite
and that was good, huh?

218
00:07:49,318 --> 00:07:50,373
- Yeah.

219
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:51,286
- Yeah.

220
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:53,353
(chuckles)

221
00:07:53,353 --> 00:07:54,186
- And I spit out.

222
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:55,019
- We're cuddling and we're going to

223
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,503
watch Chase together, okay?

224
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:58,336
- Yeah.

225
00:07:58,336 --> 00:07:59,401
- I still have my apron on.

226
00:07:59,401 --> 00:08:01,798
This is the apron that the
boys made me for mother's day.

227
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,048
- Chase is trap

228
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,893
- Did Chase get in a trap?

229
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:08,740
- Yeah.

230
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,406
- Oh no.

231
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,934
- We're all here having jell-o.

232
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:13,866
Because when you make a desert,

233
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,183
you have to bring the whole
neighborhood to have desert.

234
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,713
This is a jello from the

235
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:19,622
family recipe book that we're doing.

236
00:08:19,622 --> 00:08:21,872
Jackson, how does it taste?

237
00:08:22,892 --> 00:08:23,725
Good.

238
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:24,743
Cody, how's it taste?

239
00:08:24,743 --> 00:08:26,342
Good.

240
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:28,342
Lincoln, how's it taste?

241
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:31,109
- It tastes like jello.

242
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:33,359
(laughter)

243
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,953
- Your kids are the cutest!

244
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:40,438
Here, let's see what Calvin says.

245
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,598
Hey Calvin, What does
the jello taste like?

246
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:43,432
- Um, yum.

247
00:08:45,222 --> 00:08:46,055
- [Man] Yum?

248
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:47,866
Olivia, how does it taste?

249
00:08:47,866 --> 00:08:48,965
- Awesome.

250
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:49,798
- [Woman] Bonnie, that was hilarious.

251
00:08:49,798 --> 00:08:53,279
- That was amazing, he
was like j-e-l-l-o, jello.

252
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,439
- [Man] It's alive!

253
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,439
(laughter)

254
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:59,455
Calvin, how does it taste?

255
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,701
- I don't know.

256
00:09:00,701 --> 00:09:02,386
- I don't know, cause he's not eating it.

257
00:09:02,386 --> 00:09:04,569
- [Man] He's kind of
being a pill right now.

258
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:06,652
- [Man] Who's is this?

259
00:09:06,652 --> 00:09:08,060
- That was for Calvin.

260
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,579
Calvin and Lincoln have
a love hate relationship,

261
00:09:10,579 --> 00:09:12,543
and Calvin just got in trouble.

262
00:09:12,543 --> 00:09:13,406
- [Man] Yes, he did.

263
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,277
- No.

264
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:17,105
- Well, we'll be nicer next time, huh?

265
00:09:17,105 --> 00:09:18,438
- [Man] Uh, huh.

266
00:09:21,172 --> 00:09:23,048
It does taste like jello!

267
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,872
- I like jello.

268
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:25,835
(laughter)

269
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,345
- So Olivia, you have a question.

270
00:09:27,345 --> 00:09:29,514
You're mom said that you can go with her,

271
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:31,376
or you can stay here and play with us.

272
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:32,742
So, what we're going to do,

273
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:35,992
is we're going to flip this Spider-man.

274
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:40,357
And if it lands belly up, you stay here.

275
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,844
Belly down, you go with your mom, okay?

276
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,272
Go ahead and flip it.

277
00:09:46,272 --> 00:09:47,105
(gasps)

278
00:09:47,105 --> 00:09:48,371
- [Bonnie] So, what's it mean?

279
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,093
- [Man] You stay with your mom.

280
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:51,594
- [Woman] What do you want to do?

281
00:09:51,594 --> 00:09:52,560
- [Man] What do you want to do?

282
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,356
- I kinda want to stay here.

283
00:09:54,356 --> 00:09:56,013
- [Man] You do whatever you want!

284
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,372
- [Bonnie] You can stay.

285
00:09:57,372 --> 00:09:58,703
- [Man] You girls have fun, alright?

286
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:00,733
- Okay, we gotta go.

287
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,477
- [Man] Okay, go get your
work done. (laughter)

288
00:10:04,477 --> 00:10:06,147
Okay, kids, we're going to go downstairs,

289
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,048
and we're gonna have a
little party, alright?

290
00:10:08,048 --> 00:10:09,481
You guys ready to rock?

291
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:10,741
- Please be good.

292
00:10:10,741 --> 00:10:11,574
- [Man] Okay, Let's go kiddos.

293
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:12,883
- [Olivia] I'm gonna battle with you.

294
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:13,716
- [Man] Oh, a battle?

295
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:14,549
You got it.

296
00:10:14,549 --> 00:10:16,632
(growls)

297
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,593
(adventurous music)

298
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:19,879
(screams)

299
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:21,699
(laughter)

300
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:23,032
- Let's do this.

301
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:26,982
(adventurous music)

302
00:10:27,946 --> 00:10:30,712
(screams)

303
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,962
(laughter)

304
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,930
(playful music)

305
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,510
- We are wrapping up the
evening with the kids.

306
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:59,224
And you guys know that
Calvin has a dog collection

307
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:01,263
that he does every night before bed.

308
00:11:01,263 --> 00:11:03,992
He's got his dog blanket,
he's got his red dog,

309
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:05,126
he's got his big dog.

310
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:07,543
Minimum, that is the minimum.

311
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:10,002
- Here.

312
00:11:11,292 --> 00:11:12,870
- Oh yeah, good, thank you so much.

313
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,764
And now we are going...

314
00:11:14,764 --> 00:11:15,763
- [Jackson] I'll get the medium.

315
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:16,945
- [Man] You're going
to get the medium dog?

316
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,224
Perfect, okay.

317
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,294
Now we're adding "Biscuit."

318
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:21,550
This is the dog book.

319
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,495
So this is probably going to
be a regular for roll call.

320
00:11:24,495 --> 00:11:25,908
Oh, there's medium dog.

321
00:11:25,908 --> 00:11:27,511
Thanks Jackson, appreciate that.

322
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:28,435
Whoa!

323
00:11:28,435 --> 00:11:29,784
And Chase is on the case!

324
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:31,842
So we're going to read
this story to the kids.

325
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:33,345
Hey, where did we read this book?

326
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:34,544
- A dog book!

327
00:11:34,544 --> 00:11:35,823
- [Man] That's a dog, too, huh?

328
00:11:35,823 --> 00:11:37,393
Where did we read this book?

329
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:38,643
- At Las Vegas!

330
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:40,872
- [Man] At Las Vegas.

331
00:11:40,872 --> 00:11:42,170
Time for bed, Biscuit.

332
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,003
Woof, woof.

333
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:44,251
Biscuit wants his blanket.

334
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:45,759
Time for bed, Biscuit.

335
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:46,624
Woof, woof.

336
00:11:46,624 --> 00:11:48,741
Biscuit wants his doll.

337
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:50,213
- Yeah, why does he want his doll?

338
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:52,346
- [Man] I don't know,
sometimes doggies like dolls.

339
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:53,455
Is that cool?

340
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:54,694
- I don't.

341
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:55,878
- [Man] You don't like dolls?

342
00:11:55,878 --> 00:11:56,927
Do you like doggies?

343
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:57,799
- Yeah.

344
00:11:57,799 --> 00:11:58,632
- Yeah

345
00:11:58,632 --> 00:11:59,497
- I have a dog, too!

346
00:11:59,497 --> 00:12:00,706
- [Man] You have a dog, too, that's right.

347
00:12:00,706 --> 00:12:01,643
You have a few of them.

348
00:12:01,643 --> 00:12:03,628
- And a pen outside

349
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,825
- [Man] Yeah in pens outside.

350
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,211
- Where's teeny dog?

351
00:12:07,211 --> 00:12:08,044
- [Man] I don't know where that one is.

352
00:12:08,044 --> 00:12:08,877
I think it's upstairs.

353
00:12:08,877 --> 00:12:09,710
Okay, Biscuit!

354
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,531
- Alright guys, I'm back. (laughs)

355
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:14,531
And what I got done was a spray tan.

356
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,024
I've never had a spray tan before,

357
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:19,740
and I got the super, lightest,
lightest that they've ever

358
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,606
done on me, because I just
want an overall even color.

359
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:27,273
Growing up, I'd go
tanning in tanning beds,

360
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:31,299
and honestly once I got
married, I just stopped.

361
00:12:31,299 --> 00:12:35,008
And I'm glad that I did, because
remember a few months ago

362
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:37,156
when they took out a
precancerous spot on my back?

363
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,358
Yeah, that was not very fun or pretty.

364
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,248
I've never gotten a spray tan before.

365
00:12:41,248 --> 00:12:44,350
I don't really care to be
like, "I need to be tan!"

366
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,600
I really like my fair skin,

367
00:12:47,884 --> 00:12:48,984
I don't want to say
"pale," but my fair skin,

368
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:52,953
but I'm getting ready to
go somewhere with Bonnie

369
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:56,416
and we want to look just a
little bit more glistened.

370
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,321
And so I went and got a spray tan,

371
00:12:58,321 --> 00:13:00,087
and I get to wash it off soon.

372
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:02,295
So, first time getting it
done, we'll see if I like it.

373
00:13:02,295 --> 00:13:03,186
- [Man] Speaking of glistening,

374
00:13:03,186 --> 00:13:05,182
remember how you left your
phone case in the hotel?

375
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:08,382
- [Woman] Yeah. (laughs)

376
00:13:08,382 --> 00:13:09,215
Thank you!

377
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,512
- This is your bolly
brand of floral phone case

378
00:13:13,512 --> 00:13:14,803
- Thank you!

379
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:17,331
Guys, I have been loving your comments

380
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:19,671
and your pictures that
you're tagging us in.

381
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:22,222
All of you guys are loving the robes.

382
00:13:22,222 --> 00:13:24,454
Don't forget to check out
our Bolly Brand Website.

383
00:13:24,454 --> 00:13:25,995
We'll have that in the description.

384
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,716
- [Man] Where's your
phone so I can put it on.

385
00:13:27,716 --> 00:13:30,162
- I know, I left it in the hotel room.

386
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:31,754
I'm like, whoever gets that, is lucky.

387
00:13:31,754 --> 00:13:34,349
So this morning when I started the vlog,

388
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,108
I was still a little wishy washy,

389
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,681
and throughout the day,
I have felt much better.

390
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:44,681
I have been struggling quite a
bit this pregnancy, mentally.

391
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:49,079
I feel really healthy,
I feel really energetic.

392
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,725
Baby's doing good, I feel good,

393
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:54,490
but I've been really struggling mentally.

394
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:57,928
And there's been several times
that I've been triggered,

395
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:00,969
and it's triggered up some
emotions, some memories,

396
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:05,072
some not good things
and the last few nights

397
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:09,337
have been really low for me,
and it's just not been pretty.

398
00:14:09,337 --> 00:14:14,332
It's been a struggle to even
film, because I felt weird.

399
00:14:14,332 --> 00:14:16,461
Like, I don't know what to say,

400
00:14:16,461 --> 00:14:19,363
but I do know that I want to
talk about it a little bit.

401
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:24,061
I think that the biggest thing
for me this week has been

402
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,336
that my body has been
pregnant for a long time.

403
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:31,368
I had a miscarriage in
May, and May is coming up.

404
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:33,891
We're having the baby in
June. Calvin's birthday.

405
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:35,626
I remember Calvin's birthday last year

406
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:39,681
and not feeling up to par
because I just had a miscarriage.

407
00:14:39,681 --> 00:14:41,983
My body has gone through a lot,

408
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:43,986
and my emotions have gone through a lot,

409
00:14:43,986 --> 00:14:47,903
and so I that's just how
I'm feeling right now.

410
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:51,894
The last few days I've
had a really hard time

411
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,507
getting my anxiety under control,

412
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:57,823
and I've always been
prone to have anxiety,

413
00:14:57,823 --> 00:15:02,118
but sometimes in my life it
has come to the surface more,

414
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,985
and it's really taken over.

415
00:15:03,985 --> 00:15:07,063
After I had Calvin, it was probably

416
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:07,983
the worst it's ever been,

417
00:15:07,983 --> 00:15:12,140
and I wish I would have reached
out and gotten help then.

418
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,787
But I didn't, and I'm doing
that this time around.

419
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:18,067
I am already starting to feel much better.

420
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,192
One of my friends recommended

421
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:22,314
this book to me that I
ordered today on Amazon.

422
00:15:22,314 --> 00:15:24,288
The book is called "You are Here:

423
00:15:24,288 --> 00:15:27,108
Discovering the Magic
of a Present Moment."

424
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:30,889
And my friend said that helped
her a lot with her anxiety,

425
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,918
and it just helped her reading this book.

426
00:15:32,918 --> 00:15:36,136
I didn't think much about it.

427
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:40,552
I just thought, if you love
it, I'm open to anything,

428
00:15:40,552 --> 00:15:43,963
so I ordered the book today and
I'm very excited to read it.

429
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:45,371
I think Jared and I might read it together

430
00:15:45,371 --> 00:15:48,011
and maybe we'll do like a little
couples book review on it.

431
00:15:48,011 --> 00:15:49,844
It's just up and down.

432
00:15:50,871 --> 00:15:55,719
One day I'll be really good,
and one day I'll be really low.

433
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,711
Today, I have felt pretty good.

434
00:15:57,711 --> 00:16:00,685
The last few days,
though, the past few days

435
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:02,794
I haven't felt good, and I'm
sure if you watch the vlogs

436
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:04,614
you'll notice maybe I
wasn't in it as much,

437
00:16:04,614 --> 00:16:06,974
or I wasn't actually vlogging as much.

438
00:16:06,974 --> 00:16:09,070
It was just, that's why.

439
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,752
I have three months left.

440
00:16:11,752 --> 00:16:14,103
I am feeling good, other than my emotions.

441
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,770
My tummy feels good.

442
00:16:18,446 --> 00:16:20,352
That's life, that's baby right now.

443
00:16:20,352 --> 00:16:22,700
That's a little life update for me.

444
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,652
I'm gonna go ahead and end
the vlog and tell you guys,

445
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,651
like I do every time,
thank you for watching.

446
00:16:27,651 --> 00:16:28,918
Thank you for your support.

447
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:31,938
Thank you for your wonderful stories.

448
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:34,368
After Jared did the why vlog,

449
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,758
we were reading your guys'
messages and just were in tears,

450
00:16:37,758 --> 00:16:39,774
because it really does help us

451
00:16:39,774 --> 00:16:42,504
hearing your guys' side,
hearing your stories.

452
00:16:42,504 --> 00:16:44,731
And we have faults.

453
00:16:44,731 --> 00:16:48,911
I have regrets; I do things
everyday that I can be better.

454
00:16:48,911 --> 00:16:51,556
I can be nicer, I can
be more compassionate,

455
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:54,761
and it's something that we're
striving to do everyday.

456
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:57,179
We're not perfect, we don't
try to sit her and preach.

457
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:01,482
We're just trying to sit here
and just talk and communicate.

458
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:04,183
And you guys are kind of going
and growing along with us.

459
00:17:04,183 --> 00:17:07,967
Thank you for your stories.;
we really do appreciate it.

460
00:17:07,967 --> 00:00:00,000
And we'll see you guys next time, bye.
