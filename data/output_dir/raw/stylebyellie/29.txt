1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,350
- I know a lot of people
will not love this.

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:04,870
He was so mad.

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:05,990
- You look like you're in heaven.

4
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,850
I did not sleep last night.

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,760
Come with me, come with me.

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,550
I've got just the thing.

7
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,060
- This has been Penny for like 10 minutes.

8
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,850
I just let her out to go potty.

9
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,448
Don't look at me, keep going!

10
00:00:17,448 --> 00:00:18,930
(laughs)

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,110
She's like, "Don't stare at me".

12
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,400
She loves this.

13
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,030
She just puts her face in
the snow and it's just like,

14
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,000
look at her!

15
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,660
(laughs)

16
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,420
What shall I do when Jared
and the kids are gone?

17
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,670
I can clean, I can make dinner.

18
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,230
I think I have the best idea.

19
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,790
The last chocolate chip cookie.

20
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,880
My favorite drink.

21
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,010
The best Valentine's Day present

22
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,910
Jared could ever have gotten me.

23
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,540
Seriously, if you're pregnant or

24
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,540
you want to get your
girlfriend or wife a gift,

25
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,230
this back massager is the best thing

26
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,680
that has ever happened to me.

27
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,400
Seriously, best gift ever.

28
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,430
Thank you, Jared.

29
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,380
This is amazing.

30
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,840
And I just ate like 100 Tootsie Rolls.

31
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,239
I'm pregnant, I can do what I want!

32
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,980
On a serious note guys, sit down.

33
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,510
We're gonna chat for a minute.

34
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:12,510
I want to give you a
little update about Penny,

35
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,790
about cleaning, and about vacuums,

36
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,060
another gift.

37
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,290
I know, Jared is a spoiler.

38
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:20,123
He spoils me.

39
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:25,123
But, he got me, and him and
us and the family and Penny,

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,220
a vacuum, a robot vacuum for the floor.

41
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,380
I didn't know what I thought
about it because I just didn't

42
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,950
know if it would really be any good.

43
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,250
And it's been the best thing ever.

44
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,680
He got us a Roomba and it is amazing.

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,410
And so because of that, I also ordered...

46
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:42,160
Well, I didn't know he was
getting me that, but I had

47
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,160
ordered, in this box, is just
a bunch of filter replacements

48
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,520
so you can see how like
disgusting this vacuum is.

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,315
I need to clean it out.

50
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:54,560
I just wanted to show
you guys like what I use

51
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,300
cause I have a lot of questions,

52
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,500
What do you use to keep your house

53
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,340
clean with Penny shedding?

54
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,200
Penny is a lab, and she
is inside quite a bit,

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,630
especially with the winter.

56
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,400
We love having her around,
upstairs, and she sheds a lot.

57
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,990
So, I usually vacuum every day.

58
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,780
So every day, just here on the hard wood,

59
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,290
I use this Dyson cordless vacuum.

60
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,570
So that's what I use
for the hardwood floors,

61
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,550
and then I also have
this mop I got on Amazon.

62
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,010
This is the bucket for it.

63
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,740
You just search like, Spin
Mop and this will come up.

64
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,870
So this is the mop head.

65
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,360
I just use water with
a little bit of vinegar

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,470
and sometimes I'll use a Bona cleaner,

67
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,440
but I found that this
works the best for me,

68
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,620
is just using a mop.

69
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,810
And I usually will mop once a week.

70
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,060
And then I actually even have
a Bona mop that just has a

71
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,430
little velcro pad that you
put on it, and that's when I

72
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,690
use the Bona cleaner.

73
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,700
I just spray Bona cleaner
down and kind of spot mop.

74
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,900
I really don't use that much.

75
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,590
It's usually just a good mop once a week

76
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,000
and a vacuum everyday.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,450
So that's like what I have
and then for our main vacuum

78
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,930
for the floors for
downstairs, for the bedrooms,

79
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,980
we have another vacuum.

80
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,130
Another Dyson vacuum.

81
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,290
This is just, it's an Animal one and

82
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,860
we have used and abused it.

83
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,535
And I just got a bunch of
filter replacements for

84
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,400
all the vacuums.

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,670
Usually I will take the filters
out and I will wash them,

86
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,980
like you put it under water
and then you can wring it out.

87
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,870
And then you can even clean out in here.

88
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,210
Usually, I'll clean those once a month,

89
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:26,480
because it just gets really dirty

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,320
and really hairy with Penny.

91
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,890
And you can just see,
this was just a few uses

92
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,660
and it just is a lot of hair, and popcorn.

93
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,650
And then we just have lint rollers

94
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:38,140
and I use that for these, this is velvet.

95
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,280
You would think it
would attract more hair,

96
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,890
but it's really not bad.

97
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,980
I've been very impressed having Penny

98
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,410
and no one likes dog hair,

99
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:50,960
but we usually, when we take
her once every other month

100
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,350
to a cleaner, and she gets her
nails and she gets groomed,

101
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,830
like a really thorough cleaner.

102
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:59,480
We clean her here, but to
get a really good deep clean

103
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,830
we usually take her in
and have her get treated.

104
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:05,612
And when she goes in and gets
her treatments and her baths,

105
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,900
she gets, it's called a
Fur-minator treatment and she only

106
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,980
gets that every other time
she goes cause you don't need

107
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,813
to do that much.

108
00:04:12,813 --> 00:04:14,980
It really cleans their undercoat

109
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,260
and it really helps her
shedding decrease a lot.

110
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,269
We've been doing that
just since she was little.

111
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:23,270
So, between getting her groomed often,

112
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,590
us grooming her ourselves often,

113
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,060
and then all of the vacuuming,
the cleaning and the hair

114
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,724
really has not been bad at all.

115
00:04:33,724 --> 00:04:36,510
Obviously when the seasons
change, it gets different.

116
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,620
Like when winter came,
she was shedding tons

117
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,680
and getting her new thick coat.

118
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,520
And then in the spring she'll shed a ton

119
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,540
getting rid of that coat.

120
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,990
So, those are times when it's like crazy.

121
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,760
I can't even contain the hair.

122
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,230
But other than that, just
like on a regular basis,

123
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,510
she's really good.

124
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,840
So I just, while Jared and the
kids are gone for a minute,

125
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,840
I just really wanted to
sit down and just show you

126
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,680
the vacuums that we were using.

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,920
Just a little update with
Penny, like with that.

128
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,440
Just because we get so many questions.

129
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,080
So I hope I answered that for you.

130
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,690
And I love cleaning and vacuuming.

131
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,190
It sounds really crazy
going over how many we have.

132
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,930
It's like, "Do you really need that many?"

133
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,090
but that's nice to use,
like for thorough cleanings,

134
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,560
just day to day, when like
the kids spill, we just use

135
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,470
that little vacuum.

136
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,830
And then lately, every night,

137
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,110
Jared's been doing that
Roomba, and it's been awesome.

138
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,080
So honestly, now that we have that,

139
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,440
we probably won't use this as much.

140
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,740
But, I mean, we have it,
I'm going to totally use it.

141
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,590
But that was very nice of Jared,

142
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,070
because usually I vacuum every day

143
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,740
and since he got that for me,

144
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,450
the last like three days,

145
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,820
I haven't vacuumed at all.

146
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,460
Because he's just put the
Roomba on and it works so well.

147
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,050
I always clean out my filter
over on that big vacuum,

148
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,290
because we've had it for a year

149
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,320
but I haven't ever cleaned out
the filter on this one yet.

150
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,830
Thanks to YouTube, figured
out how to undo this bad boy.

151
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:49,750
But I just get it wet,
rinse all the grossness out,

152
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,990
wipe this down and then
I ordered new filters.

153
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,272
So Jackson just walked in
from school, and he said,

154
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,400
"I'm still four."

155
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,682
You are still four!

156
00:05:58,682 --> 00:05:59,515
(gasps)

157
00:05:59,515 --> 00:06:00,570
What is that?

158
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:04,240
- [Jared] Did they save
your Valentine stuff?

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,407
- [Ellie] Aww.

160
00:06:06,907 --> 00:06:08,650
- Saved me these.

161
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,375
- [Ellie] Wow, Jackson was
sick on his Valentine's party.

162
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:14,410
(doorbell rings)

163
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,243
- [Jared] Someone's at the door!

164
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:16,076
- Door just rang.

165
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,623
10 bucks it's the
neighborhood kids wanting to

166
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:18,907
use the Segways.

167
00:06:18,907 --> 00:06:20,074
- [Ellie] Wow.

168
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:24,840
- I get my candy.

169
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,760
- [Ellie] That's your special
candy from Valentine's Day.

170
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
- [Jackson] I need to open it.

171
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,683
- [Ellie] Wow, did he get
a Valentine's Day package?

172
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:32,550
- Mm-hmm.

173
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,630
- [Ellie] Wow.

174
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,840
- I bet you if you asked
Jackson very very nice...

175
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,830
- [Ellie] He might.

176
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,830
- [Jared] He might give you some.

177
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,379
- [Ellie] You can't take
it though, you gotta ask.

178
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,590
- [Jared] Yeah, you gotta ask first.

179
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,380
- [Jackson] I dropped one.

180
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,094
You can have M&M's.

181
00:06:45,094 --> 00:06:46,210
- [Calvin] No.

182
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,850
- [Ellie] Oh, if you're not
happy with what you get,

183
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,683
you can't get it.

184
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,650
This is Jackson's, and he's sharing.

185
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,270
Cal, can you give him that one?

186
00:06:53,197 --> 00:06:54,030
- That's mine.

187
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,960
- Kids, toddlers,
learning, sharing, giving.

188
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,460
We're all learning in this household, huh?

189
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,470
Jackson, that's cool, that
was so nice of your teacher

190
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,730
to save this for you.

191
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,196
- [Jared] I know, that's so cool.

192
00:07:05,196 --> 00:07:07,100
- Even I got this.

193
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:13,741
- [Ellie] Whoa, someone
went all out with the candy.

194
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:15,900
- [Jackson] Even Mickey Mouse.

195
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,733
- [Ellie] Wow.

196
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:17,566
- Minnie Mouse.

197
00:07:17,566 --> 00:07:19,249
- [Ellie] Should we see who it's from?

198
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:20,166
- Yeah.

199
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,280
- [Ellie] Wow.

200
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,210
- [Jared] Jackson, that
was so nice of you.

201
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,340
- [Ellie] We are just going
to eat candy on the floor.

202
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,690
- Sounds like my kind of day.

203
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,050
- [Ellie] What do we say to Jackson?

204
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,001
He gave you three candies.

205
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:34,361
- Only got him two.

206
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,786
- [Ellie] Oh, but he took three?

207
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:36,619
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:37,452
(Jared and Ellie laugh)

209
00:07:37,452 --> 00:07:38,850
- [Ellie] Say thank you.

210
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,090
- Thank you.

211
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,640
- [Ellie] That was so nice of him.

212
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,070
He was so mad that he couldn't
have his dog in the tub.

213
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,930
He was so mad.

214
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,860
- He zonked in my arms.

215
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,760
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh, our kids are tired.

216
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,800
- You know what's crazy?

217
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,633
- [Ellie] What?

218
00:07:56,633 --> 00:08:00,030
- My right hand and arm is asleep.

219
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:02,930
And it hurts, so bad, like needles.

220
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,364
- [Ellie] Doesn't help that
you worked out this morning.

221
00:08:06,364 --> 00:08:08,031
Goodnight, baby boy.

222
00:08:09,063 --> 00:08:10,298
(laughs)

223
00:08:10,298 --> 00:08:11,640
- That's a growl snore.

224
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,810
- [Ellie] Goodnight, Jackson's in bed.

225
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,643
- Oh, good.

226
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:15,830
- So, while I was in the
bedroom, wrestling with Calvin,

227
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,060
trying to get him to sleep,

228
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,660
and not get his puppy in the bathtub,

229
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,880
Ellie texted me and she said,
"I think I'm going to crash.

230
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,210
"I did not sleep last night."

231
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,800
And I said, "Oh no, mama,
you can't be not sleeping,

232
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,440
"especially while you're pregnant."

233
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,559
So I think it's time
we take drastic times,

234
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,209
and put them to drastic measures.

235
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,159
No no no, drastic times
call for drastic measures.

236
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,489
Oh look, she is zonked
out on the couch already.

237
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,330
- I did just yell at Jared.

238
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,163
- [Jared] I've got something...

239
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:45,790
- Just like, why did I get mad?

240
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,180
- [Jared] Cause of light.

241
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,345
It's too bright.

242
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:49,178
- He turned the light on, he's like,

243
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:50,011
"I'm gonna film a couple,"

244
00:08:50,011 --> 00:08:50,844
and I'm like, "No!"

245
00:08:50,844 --> 00:08:51,677
- [Jared] "No!"

246
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:52,580
Okay, come with me.

247
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,650
- Just cause it hurts my eyes.

248
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,520
- [Jared] Come with me, come with me,

249
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,890
I've got just the thing.

250
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,410
Yes, this is the time to do it.

251
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,389
What about this light?

252
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:00,539
Is this light okay?

253
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,574
It's a little bright.

254
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,030
Here, okay, hold on, here we go.

255
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,306
Okay, underneath this bed, here,

256
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:07,160
hold our friends, hold our
friends, hold our friends.

257
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,140
- [Ellie] Get her out.

258
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,030
- ♪ Dun, da da dun dun dun dun ♪

259
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,370
Probably the greatest
pregnancy related item ever,

260
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,433
it's under our bed, for safe keeping.

261
00:09:15,433 --> 00:09:16,560
(Ellie laughs)

262
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,455
- [Ellie] So Jared doesn't trip on it.

263
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:20,020
(gasps)

264
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,853
Yes!

265
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,728
Open that up.

266
00:09:24,728 --> 00:09:28,310
Bonnie stored it for me
forever, thank Bon, in that bag.

267
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:30,120
Pregnancy pillow!

268
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,880
No seriously, I did not sleep.

269
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,110
I dunno if it was like, a little insomnia,

270
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,530
like I just was awake and I was like,

271
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,010
"Oh my gosh, go to bed."

272
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,000
Because we had to wake
up super early today.

273
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,200
We've been filming all
morning, not for vlog, but...

274
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,300
Yes, I cannot even wait.

275
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,270
- Here's the thing, I have mixed feelings

276
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,200
about these pregnancy pillows.

277
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,980
- [Ellie] It stinks cause
then we can't cuddle.

278
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
- We can't cuddle.

279
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,800
I end up cuddling with
this inanimate object

280
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,020
who is not my wife, or trying to anyway,

281
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,660
and then you're all wrapped up in this

282
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:00,720
all like, cuddled up like a cloud.

283
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,080
- It is true, like I'm in my own space

284
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,320
when we use these.

285
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,510
Okay, do you guys, when you sleep,

286
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,900
do you cuddle with your spouse,

287
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,260
or do you like, need your own space?

288
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,850
- This is just Ellie and me.

289
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,530
This is us, this is us.

290
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,880
- [Ellie] Our butts touch.

291
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,220
- Our butts touch, that's one thing,

292
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,160
or I sit on Ellie's feet,

293
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,078
or our legs are kinda
like wrapped like that.

294
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:20,980
(Ellie laughs)

295
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,210
That's literally how we sleep.

296
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,740
- Usually how we sleep is our butts touch

297
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,974
and then our legs are
wrapped up, just our ankles,

298
00:10:25,974 --> 00:10:29,000
but then our heads and
shoulders are kept away.

299
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,720
- You're a bum toucher,

300
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,479
and I have never liked you more.

301
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:35,263
Mosey on in there, in your
little cocoon of happiness.

302
00:10:35,263 --> 00:10:38,815
- Put this in between my
legs, this on my butt.

303
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:39,700
Ahh.

304
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,000
- [Jared] You look like
you're in heaven, good.

305
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,833
You close your eyes.

306
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,846
- Now turn off the light!

307
00:10:44,846 --> 00:10:45,679
(Jared laughs)

308
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,512
- [Jared] I love you sweetie.

309
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:47,345
- Oh, I love you.

310
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:48,178
(Jared laughs)

311
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:49,240
- Now this is the life.

312
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,550
Sitting down, painting your fingernails.

313
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,860
I have Calvin's liquid bandage glue

314
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,370
cause one of my nails broke and

315
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:59,150
I'm gonna see if that'll work,

316
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,520
while your husband cooks dinner.

317
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,954
(upbeat music)

318
00:11:12,681 --> 00:11:13,910
Yeah!

319
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:15,980
- [Jared] Oo!

320
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,893
- [Ellie] Good job!

321
00:11:16,893 --> 00:11:19,470
- I see people do this all the time.

322
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,470
- [Ellie] Oh my.

323
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,021
Maybe you need a bigger knife,

324
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:25,080
like a butcher knife or something.

325
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,670
All of our kids are in bed,
so we can enjoy dinner.

326
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,900
- [Jared] Oh, she disappeared!

327
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,080
There she is.

328
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,630
She is watching us like a hawk.

329
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,880
- But this girl.

330
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,083
Why aren't you in bed?

331
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,687
Go to bed, go go.

332
00:11:38,687 --> 00:11:40,136
(laughs)

333
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:42,015
- Do you wanna get in your bed?

334
00:11:42,015 --> 00:11:43,432
- [Together] Aww!

335
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,610
- That's funny.

336
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,870
We'll give you a little, Penny.

337
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,015
- Yeah we'll give you some.

338
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:50,848
She's been a good girl.

339
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:51,681
- [Ellie] When we're done.

340
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:52,960
So I'm gonna talk about something

341
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,080
and I know a lot of
people will not love this

342
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,440
but I hope that everybody, I know

343
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,930
that a lot of people are
gonna be very supportive,

344
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,020
Jared and I talked a lot
about when the baby comes,

345
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,320
we'll be filming Monday through Friday

346
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,040
and that will give us a few days to recoup

347
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,640
you know, adjusting with baby, and

348
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,220
I've been telling Jared lately,

349
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,690
just with how I've been feeling mentally,

350
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,380
like I feel really good some days

351
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,050
and some days I really don't, and

352
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:23,130
how I feel physically right now,

353
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:26,570
I need a few days to recharge and

354
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,650
Sundays we go to church
and then we come home

355
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:31,420
and I just would love that time to just be

356
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,630
coming home and just not thinking.

357
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:36,230
So I would like to start doing a

358
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,360
Monday through Friday right now

359
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,090
and not film this weekend.

360
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:42,360
I feel like I need it mentally,

361
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,960
and I feel like it would be good for you,

362
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,960
editing wise, sleep wise, just
a recharge in life right now.

363
00:12:50,282 --> 00:12:51,115
- Yeah.

364
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:52,720
- And I'm feeling really
good and I want to

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,313
do this before I like, don't, you know.

366
00:12:55,313 --> 00:12:57,640
- You wanna stay ahead of it, you know.

367
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,910
- And my goal this year, my one goal,

368
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,570
is just peace, I just wanna feel peaceful

369
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,620
with the decisions I make, and this is

370
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,820
a decision I wanna make
and I'm gonna make it

371
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,780
and I'm going to be happy and peaceful

372
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,810
with that decision, and I'm just slowly

373
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,100
thinking about how I'm feeling and

374
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,970
just doing what I need to do.

375
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,300
- And, as a husband, I
want to support that.

376
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,120
I wanna support you, and I
wanna support our family,

377
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,180
and our happiness, and if
that's what we have to do,

378
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,960
then by gosh, gall darn
it, we're gonna do it.

379
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,793
- Well thank you.

380
00:13:30,793 --> 00:13:31,626
- I love you.

381
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,080
- I love you, and we love you guys

382
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,920
and we're grateful for your support.

383
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,740
Like I said, I know that some people

384
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,990
are gonna be like, "No!"

385
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:41,050
but I need to do it if I'm going to...

386
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,499
I just need that.

387
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:44,900
(laughs)

388
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,680
Thank you guys so much for watching today.

389
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,220
We really appreciate it.

390
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,700
I'm going to go snuggle my little pillow,

391
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,310
don't worry, I'll keep my feet for you.

392
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,830
- I was gonna say, I want, at least

393
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,434
give me one foot to sit on.

394
00:13:56,434 --> 00:13:57,280
(laughs)

395
00:13:57,280 --> 00:00:00,000
- Okay, we'll see you guys, bye.
