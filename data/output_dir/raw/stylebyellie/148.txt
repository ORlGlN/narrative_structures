1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:03,376
(elegant jazzy music)

2
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,553
- [Bonnie] Those guys
are being really rude.

3
00:00:05,553 --> 00:00:06,386
- [Joel] Oh.

4
00:00:06,386 --> 00:00:07,730
(crunching leaves)

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:08,657
- I double dare you

6
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:09,907
- He's gonna see the camera's on.

7
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:11,319
- on our date night.

8
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:13,569
(laughing)

9
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:16,367
- Like they're cousins.

10
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,189
- Is that 'cause Boston has 'em?

11
00:00:18,189 --> 00:00:19,022
- Yeah.

12
00:00:19,022 --> 00:00:19,855
- Doggie doggie.

13
00:00:19,855 --> 00:00:21,013
- The pop up track has 'em.
- Yeah.

14
00:00:21,013 --> 00:00:22,354
- Wow.

15
00:00:22,354 --> 00:00:23,187
- I want that one.

16
00:00:23,187 --> 00:00:25,732
- You want me to sit?

17
00:00:25,732 --> 00:00:28,473
- I want to get a car track.

18
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:30,248
- A race car track?

19
00:00:30,248 --> 00:00:34,704
- Yeah, it has tracks,
everythings and cars.

20
00:00:34,704 --> 00:00:35,537
- So fun.

21
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:36,399
- That is fun.

22
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,140
We have been down here
in this filming area

23
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,678
prepping some videos for while we are gone

24
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:43,389
and it has just been so fun.

25
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:45,125
Some videos to look forward to,

26
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:48,653
we just got done telling
our first kiss story,

27
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:50,817
but not necessarily our first kiss,

28
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,584
like our very first kiss story.

29
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:55,132
We also did the house Q & A today,

30
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,523
so that was a lot of fun.

31
00:00:57,523 --> 00:00:59,019
I put on different shirts

32
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:00,563
to make it seem like
they were different days,

33
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:02,341
but Ellie didn't,

34
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,796
so that's a little fail on our part,

35
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:07,220
to make it look like different days,

36
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,644
but either way, it's kinda funny,

37
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:12,031
you'll see that and you'll know.

38
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,490
(Ellie laughs)

39
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,779
- [Ellie] You whistle at her?

40
00:01:15,779 --> 00:01:16,612
Whistle,

41
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:19,525
whistle at her.

42
00:01:20,511 --> 00:01:22,122
He was whistling a minute ago

43
00:01:22,122 --> 00:01:23,772
and yelling at her.

44
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,014
- Well we've been booed.

45
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:28,274
Booed booed booed, but in a good way.

46
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:30,322
Our neighbors, I swear, are the kindest.

47
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,707
We have this at our front door.

48
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,741
And what that is,

49
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:35,091
I don't know if your neighborhood does it,

50
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,417
but my neighborhood as a kid we did it

51
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,954
every once in awhile.

52
00:01:37,954 --> 00:01:39,876
You've been booed or ghosted

53
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,289
or hearted on Valentine's Day.

54
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,898
Essentially you get
this paper at your door

55
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,569
with some goodies.

56
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:49,271
Oh those cookies just
fell everywhere, shoot.

57
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:50,104
(laughing)

58
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:51,021
- Aww.
- Oh.

59
00:01:52,033 --> 00:01:53,524
- Penny

60
00:01:53,524 --> 00:01:54,357
or bread

61
00:01:55,724 --> 00:01:57,668
and you know, just some treats

62
00:01:57,668 --> 00:01:59,139
our neighbors gave to us

63
00:01:59,139 --> 00:02:00,559
and what you do is once you get that,

64
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:03,558
you go to your neighbors
who haven't been booed

65
00:02:03,558 --> 00:02:06,486
and give them a tasty treat, too.

66
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:09,348
So it's a fun little chain
letter that we're doing,

67
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:11,659
so I'm gonna go and grab
some things together

68
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,371
and we're gonna go boo our neighbors.

69
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:16,291
Some people bake, some people buy,

70
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:18,143
I'm gonna get some good
treats from the store here,

71
00:02:18,143 --> 00:02:19,793
and get 'em delivered tonight.

72
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:21,008
(crunching plastic)

73
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,194
(crunching leaves)

74
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:25,694
(chill music)

75
00:02:30,658 --> 00:02:31,988
- You got two new toothbrushes.

76
00:02:31,988 --> 00:02:33,088
- I did get new toothbrushes.

77
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,408
- I'm tired.

78
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:35,363
- [Jared] Oh you are so tired.

79
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:39,187
You've had a long rough day, haven't you?

80
00:02:39,187 --> 00:02:40,020
Yes.

81
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,510
- Jackson look, Daddy
got you a new toothbrush.

82
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,598
They're the same though.

83
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,949
- That's so they don't
have too many fights

84
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:48,869
over which tooth brush they want.

85
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,541
I tried to do a smart thing.

86
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,613
Anyway, so
- You're cute.

87
00:02:51,613 --> 00:02:53,052
- [Ellie] I'm not complaining.

88
00:02:53,052 --> 00:02:55,642
- Delivering those little treats

89
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,309
was a lot harder than I thought.

90
00:02:59,371 --> 00:03:00,204
It was crazy.

91
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:01,876
Because I had a couple people in mind.

92
00:03:01,876 --> 00:03:03,183
I was like oh, these are our friends,

93
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,939
I would love to go boo them,

94
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,795
I don't know the correct terminology.

95
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:07,974
- [Jackson] I'm brushing my teeth.

96
00:03:07,974 --> 00:03:10,690
- Oh good, that's great hygiene.

97
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,987
And I went there, already been booed.

98
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:13,820
- How do you know?

99
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,106
- Because you put little stickers

100
00:03:15,106 --> 00:03:18,142
in the window, so you're
not hit more than once.

101
00:03:18,142 --> 00:03:19,564
So everyone has a turn.

102
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:20,951
- Never put stickers in the window,

103
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,164
that way you get as many
cookies as you can get.

104
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:25,198
- It's kinda true though.

105
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:26,031
- That's cute though.

106
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,077
- So I went to a few different places.

107
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:28,944
All of our friends that we
- Who did you go to?

108
00:03:28,944 --> 00:03:29,777
- Well I'll tell ya,

109
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,501
all of our friends had 'em already.

110
00:03:31,501 --> 00:03:33,967
So I was like man, okay well we've got

111
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,188
some pretty good friends, so
I went to all these places,

112
00:03:36,188 --> 00:03:38,484
I ended up going to our excavator's house

113
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,364
and I dropped a thing off there.

114
00:03:40,364 --> 00:03:41,266
- Awww.
- Yeah.

115
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:42,099
- Cute.

116
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:42,932
- We really like their family.

117
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:43,818
- He just lives down the street.

118
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:44,737
- Yeah.

119
00:03:44,737 --> 00:03:47,890
And then, I don't know
if I should say this

120
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,578
because they might watch our videos.

121
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,099
I don't care.

122
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:53,202
The person who did this, I
just went to their house,

123
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:54,325
so Chelsea.
- Oh oh cute.

124
00:03:54,325 --> 00:03:55,491
- Yeah I did theirs.

125
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:57,107
So that was fun.

126
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:57,940
It was harder than I thought,

127
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,932
because I had to go to way
more houses than I thought.

128
00:04:00,932 --> 00:04:03,166
Would you look at that sunset?

129
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:07,340
It looks like, what was the
word you said Barney, Bonnie?

130
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,740
- [Bonnie] Barney?

131
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,573
- [Jared] Barney?

132
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:12,369
There was just a funny word.
- It looks gorgeous.

133
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:14,414
- [Jared] Gorgeous.

134
00:04:14,414 --> 00:04:15,401
- [Bonnie] Gorgeous.

135
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:16,233
- [Joel] Do you know my favorite thing

136
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:17,066
about the mountains Jared?

137
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,216
- [Jared] What's that?

138
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,947
- They look like a photograph turning.

139
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:21,445
- [Jared] Aww, yeah.

140
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,378
- [Joel] Potatoes as a side.

141
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:23,981
- [Jared] That sounds really great.

142
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:25,197
- [Joel] That sounds really good.

143
00:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,009
- [Jared] Sounds really good.

144
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,978
Sounds delicious.

145
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:32,145
- [Joel] These things sound very good.

146
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:37,995
- [Bonnie] Those guys
are being really rude

147
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:38,828
- [Joel] Oh.

148
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:40,660
- [Bonnie] You guys are being really rude.

149
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,591
That wasn't even fun,

150
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:44,843
I just took his camera
and Jared, fix your lens.

151
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:47,686
- I have to fix it
every clip I film, okay?

152
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:51,653
So it's just a little (kissing).

153
00:04:51,653 --> 00:04:53,591
- You're making us feel uncomfortable.

154
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,853
- Sorry, we just like to kiss in private

155
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:57,566
in public places.

156
00:04:57,566 --> 00:04:59,053
- In private, in public places?

157
00:04:59,053 --> 00:04:59,886
- Yeah.

158
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:00,773
(laughing)

159
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:02,145
It's a little door, it's our wall.

160
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:05,037
- Isn't this so cute, guys?

161
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,702
- [Bonnie] Yes.

162
00:05:06,702 --> 00:05:08,114
- [Ellie] It's called the Timber Mine.

163
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,728
- This is The Copper Mill.

164
00:05:09,728 --> 00:05:10,868
(laughing)

165
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,196
It's not the Copper Mine,

166
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:13,068
it's not The Timber Mill,

167
00:05:13,068 --> 00:05:14,250
it's not The Timber Mine,

168
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,702
it's The Copper Mill.

169
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:17,183
- I was thinking of that place,

170
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,023
because we just got a gift card

171
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:19,856
to give to our

172
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,161
builder.
- Builder.

173
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:23,384
- That's why I said it.

174
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:25,369
We're at The Copper Mill.

175
00:05:25,369 --> 00:05:26,952
And it's so woodsy.

176
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:30,390
And I sat by the fireplace
and it was lovely.

177
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,117
- And kicks people off of the fireplace.

178
00:05:32,117 --> 00:05:34,294
- Well what happened, it was so funny.

179
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:37,264
Ellie walks in and then
I walk in after her,

180
00:05:37,264 --> 00:05:38,541
so I don't see what she does

181
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,628
or what happened beforehand.

182
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:40,679
- [Ellie] And we had just
gotten talking about it.

183
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,159
- Yeah, talking about doing funny things

184
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,536
in public places

185
00:05:44,536 --> 00:05:47,503
and I walk in and Ellie sits down

186
00:05:47,503 --> 00:05:48,831
right next to this girl

187
00:05:48,831 --> 00:05:50,936
and this girl gets up
and they say something,

188
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,872
and I'm like did you just kick her out

189
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:56,225
of that seat, because you
wanted to sit by the fire?

190
00:05:56,225 --> 00:05:58,601
- What had really happened
is I sat down next to her

191
00:05:58,601 --> 00:06:00,577
and we smiled and I said this is nice

192
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:01,894
and then she was really hot

193
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:02,727
and she got up.

194
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:03,560
- [Jared] Because it was by the fire.

195
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,765
- And she got up and left.

196
00:06:04,765 --> 00:06:05,809
And Jared said oh did you kick her out

197
00:06:05,809 --> 00:06:07,295
and she laughed and played along,

198
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:08,817
and said yeah she did,

199
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:09,943
and then it was really funny.

200
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:12,103
(laughing)

201
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:13,482
I didn't kick her out.

202
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,962
We became really good friends.

203
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,050
- Actually we did, we talked with them

204
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,411
for a few minutes after that.

205
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,272
Here's the deal okay?

206
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:21,406
You haven't talked yet to the waiter.

207
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:22,770
We all have.

208
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,230
So I double dare you,

209
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,496
that when you order,

210
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,744
to do it in a Russian accent.

211
00:06:29,744 --> 00:06:31,068
- I don't know a Russian accent.

212
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,390
- Okay okay then
- That's too much work.

213
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,679
- Then any accent.

214
00:06:33,679 --> 00:06:36,433
You have to order, any time
you talk to him directly,

215
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,817
you have to use a different accent.

216
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,650
Okay?
- Oh.

217
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:40,661
- [Ellie] You do not have to.

218
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:41,494
- Different.

219
00:06:41,494 --> 00:06:42,327
- I'm gonna do it.

220
00:06:42,327 --> 00:06:43,676
I'm gonna do it.
- You have to do it, okay?

221
00:06:43,676 --> 00:06:44,509
- You do it.

222
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:46,214
Joel's really good at
stuff you tell him to do.

223
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,550
- Do the Wisconsin accent.

224
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,717
- Wisconsin?

225
00:06:48,717 --> 00:06:49,550
- [Jared] Yeah.

226
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,208
- Oh yeah, you know this
steak looks really good,

227
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,041
ya know?
- Yes.

228
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:52,874
- There you go.

229
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:53,707
That's what you should do.

230
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:54,540
So I double dare you

231
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,040
- He's gonna see the camera's on.

232
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,952
- on our date night, to do an accent

233
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:01,427
when you order, okay?
- You do not have to.

234
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:02,913
- Yes he does, this is a double dare.

235
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:04,011
- So what, it's a date, so I don't want

236
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:05,221
to overwhelm them.

237
00:07:05,221 --> 00:07:06,506
- It's a double dare date night.

238
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:07,339
- Okay we're good.
- It's happening.

239
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:08,843
- It's happening.
- Double dog date?

240
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:09,929
- [Jared] Double dog dare.

241
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,466
- Okay, just give 'em a sample.

242
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,970
- [Jared] Give me a little sam sam.

243
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,204
- Oh yeah you know these steaks,

244
00:07:14,204 --> 00:07:16,017
they look really good, you know.

245
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:18,905
We caught 'em down at a
shop in Fayette, ya know?

246
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,860
(laughing)

247
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,396
- Down at the shop,
that's a good every time.

248
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:24,746
- Here he is.

249
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,845
Thank you.
- Are you guys ready to order?

250
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:28,762
- What kind of jelly is that?
- Jam?

251
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:32,217
- We call it jam.

252
00:07:32,217 --> 00:07:33,818
Do you call it jam or jelly?

253
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:36,180
- I'm ready, so I'm gonna order.

254
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,041
- Oh you know, I think I'm
gonna do the filet mignon.

255
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,874
And the hand-breaded shrimp,

256
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:42,385
how big are those shrimp?

257
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,343
- About like
- Prawns.

258
00:07:44,343 --> 00:07:45,670
- So a pretty good size, yeah?

259
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,110
Okay, I'll do that,

260
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,784
and then does that come
with a soup or salad?

261
00:07:49,784 --> 00:07:51,836
- Oh Wisconsin, that's pretty close, yeah.

262
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,308
I lived in Minnesota and
it was pretty similar.

263
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:54,729
- [Ellie] What?

264
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:56,152
- Yours is good enough.

265
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:58,402
(laughing)

266
00:08:00,798 --> 00:08:02,554
- That's awesome, okay.

267
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:04,707
- He totally called you out on that.

268
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:05,824
- What are the odds of that?

269
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,235
- He's from Wisconsin.
- I know.

270
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,420
- He is from Wisconsin.

271
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,253
- What are the odds of that?

272
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:10,963
- Well he said Canadian Wisconsin

273
00:08:10,963 --> 00:08:12,799
and his accent is like

274
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,799
(clapping)

275
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:16,979
- Like he was like, he wanted
some Cheetos and Red bull.

276
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,231
Or something, I can't even do it.

277
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,064
It was magical.

278
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,135
- We need to ask him to
do it, ask him to do it.

279
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:20,968
- [Jared] Yeah, yeah I will.

280
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,572
- I feel like that backfired.

281
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:24,297
- It really was.
- What are the odds of that?

282
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:25,974
- He said you were good.
- That thar backfired.

283
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:26,807
- It really did.

284
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,938
- Literally if I'd have
done a Russian accent

285
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:29,838
or whatever,

286
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:31,240
do you think he'd have been like,

287
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,597
well I'm from the Soviet, you know.

288
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:36,215
- [Jared] Yeah, that would not happen, no.

289
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,823
(laughing)

290
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:39,204
- Do it like

291
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:40,999
yeah yeah, you got it.

292
00:08:40,999 --> 00:08:42,499
Do your upper lip.

293
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:47,043
- [Jared] What are you trying to do Elvis?

294
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,119
What are you trying to do?

295
00:08:51,119 --> 00:08:53,689
- I love it when I make Bonnie wheeze.

296
00:08:53,689 --> 00:08:56,633
Don't do your bottom lip just the top.

297
00:08:56,633 --> 00:08:57,466
- I can't.

298
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,299
- [Jared] What is it?

299
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,632
- I'm trying it.

300
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:03,744
- [Jared] What are you doing, I can't

301
00:09:03,744 --> 00:09:05,003
(laughing)

302
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:07,864
- Just quiver your upper lip.

303
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,910
- [Jared] Quiver?

304
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,001
(laughing)

305
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:12,834
- Do it.

306
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,541
He doesn't have much lips to begin

307
00:09:21,842 --> 00:09:23,994
Jared that's good.

308
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:26,077
Now just your bottom one.

309
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,546
(laughing)

310
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:29,379
Just your

311
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,472
- Do your whole mouth.
- It's not a quiver,

312
00:09:35,472 --> 00:09:37,894
- [Jared] it just moves.

313
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:40,144
(laughing)

314
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:55,365
(Jared laughing)

315
00:09:57,307 --> 00:09:59,557
(laughing)

316
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,586
You know what Bonnie and I used to do?

317
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:09,178
When we were on the road trips,

318
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:13,922
Bonnie would make me talk
to her and read lips,

319
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:17,208
so Bonnie and I are really
good at reading lips.

320
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,946
'Cause we use to say
words and we had to guess

321
00:10:18,946 --> 00:10:20,901
what she was saying.

322
00:10:20,901 --> 00:10:22,647
- [Jared] So you practiced
a lot at reading lips

323
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:23,571
so you're good.
- We did.

324
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:24,916
- And we're really good at it.

325
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,806
- We're good at focusing.

326
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:28,913
- That's why did so good on
that video we just got off.

327
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:30,640
- You know what I noticed when you guys

328
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:31,973
were doing your

329
00:10:33,328 --> 00:10:34,759
you guys have the same earrings on.

330
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,592
- We do!

331
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,930
- [Jared] You guys must be sisters.

332
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,071
- Thanks.

333
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:41,532
- We had so much fun on our date night

334
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:43,726
with Bonnie and Joel.

335
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,271
You know, we love to laugh.

336
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:46,975
It's so much fun.

337
00:10:46,975 --> 00:10:48,150
So that brings me to the question

338
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,002
that I want to pass to you.

339
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:51,273
What is your favorite date night?

340
00:10:51,273 --> 00:10:53,729
What is your favorite activity to do

341
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:55,225
whether it's like double date

342
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,625
or just with your spouse?

343
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,601
Let me know what's the best.

344
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:02,220
Bonus points if it's cost
effective, like cheap,

345
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,642
if you can do it for free.

346
00:11:03,642 --> 00:11:05,159
What's your favorite date.

347
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,682
Let me know in the comments down below.

348
00:11:06,682 --> 00:11:07,788
Today has been crazy.

349
00:11:07,788 --> 00:11:09,467
We got a lot of work
done behind the scenes,

350
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,807
which is kinda frustrating sometimes

351
00:11:11,807 --> 00:11:13,849
because I'm so actively in the office

352
00:11:13,849 --> 00:11:16,285
doing things and you guys don't see that.

353
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:18,861
But, at any rate, we had a blast tonight

354
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:19,694
with Bonnie and Joel.

355
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:21,430
We laughed really hard.

356
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,263
It was great,

357
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,246
so thank you so much for watching.

358
00:11:24,246 --> 00:11:26,770
We hope you have a wonderful day, night,

359
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:29,686
evening, weekend, whenever
you're watching this,

360
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:31,688
I hope you have a smile on your face.

361
00:11:31,688 --> 00:11:33,702
