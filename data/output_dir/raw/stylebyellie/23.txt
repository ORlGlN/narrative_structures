1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,012
- Good morning guys.

2
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:02,260
Before the vlog starts,

3
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:04,046
we have a very special announcement

4
00:00:04,046 --> 00:00:05,270
that we want to make.

5
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:08,189
In fact, we all have a
very special announcement

6
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,023
we want to make.

7
00:00:09,023 --> 00:00:10,047
Ellie, take it away.

8
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:11,870
- A year in the making,

9
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,360
we are so excited to announce

10
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,696
that we have a custom clothing line.

11
00:00:16,696 --> 00:00:17,995
- Bollie!

12
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,103
- Bollie!
- Bollie!

13
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:21,840
- Bolliebrand.com is up and running,

14
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,500
our custom clothing line, Bonnie.

15
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,480
This has been so fun.

16
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,720
We have all gotten together
1,000 times this year.

17
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,380
- It has been work work work work work.

18
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,930
- Non-stop fun and work.
- Non-stop.

19
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,700
- It has been amazing.

20
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,240
We will have our video

21
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,520
that Bonnie and I just filmed

22
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,300
in the description about Bollie

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,350
and we'll have bolliebrand.com,

24
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:46,017
our website, in the description.

25
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:46,850
- Go check it out.

26
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,850
- This has been an amazing journey

27
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,095
and it's just the beginning.

28
00:00:50,095 --> 00:00:51,140
(signal tone)
(popping)

29
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:53,300
- I swear I'm funnier in real life

30
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,460
than on the vlogs.

31
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,640
This is the ultimate bath bomb.

32
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,082
Lush, take a note.

33
00:00:57,082 --> 00:00:58,054
(yelling)
(bright music)

34
00:00:58,054 --> 00:01:00,060
Yeah!
- That looks awesome!

35
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,998
- Doesn't that look so good?

36
00:01:00,998 --> 00:01:03,480
(Penny barking)

37
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,130
Listen, I know, okay?

38
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,490
These things have been in the closet

39
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,010
for some time now.

40
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,770
It's been a long time coming.

41
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,069
I'm going to clean through my bins.

42
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,220
You're sitting on my bins.

43
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,053
These are your bins.

44
00:01:15,053 --> 00:01:16,420
You've got some bins to go through too.

45
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,270
Or have you already done it?

46
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,698
- I did it.

47
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:19,531
- [Jared] You did it.

48
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:22,734
You took these two bins
and put 'em in there?

49
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:23,830
- And in here.

50
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,477
- [Jared] And there, aww cute.

51
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,310
- Keeping those.

52
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,630
- Keeping those, you bet you are.

53
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,470
So here's the thing,

54
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:32,860
when I go through old stuff,

55
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,400
I never sort through it and clean it,

56
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,670
I just reminisce.

57
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,160
That's what I do, and I'm like oh--

58
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,340
- That's usually what you should do.

59
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,770
- Yeah you do, but then
instead of a 15, 20 minute job,

60
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,690
it turns into a two hour job.

61
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,070
And we don't have two hours to spend,

62
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,556
to do this, you know what I mean?

63
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:49,780
- Mmm-hmm, but we're doing it.

64
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,700
- We're doing it right now.

65
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,080
And in the meantime, if feel like

66
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,280
we might show you a couple things,

67
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,730
so you can reminisce with us.

68
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,440
We'll do a little split.

69
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,065
- In the back of my underwear drawer,

70
00:01:58,065 --> 00:01:59,370
(Jared laughs)

71
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,280
these are the tests from baby,

72
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,338
which like look at my tummy today.

73
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:05,810
- [Jared] I know, you have popped,

74
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,100
like your belly has popped.

75
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,210
- I feel like it has.

76
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,112
Bonnie told me the other day,

77
00:02:09,112 --> 00:02:11,680
she's like you look really pregnant.

78
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,940
And I feel like I do.

79
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,000
- [Jared] You do look pregnant,

80
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm glad you look it.
- So I will keep one.

81
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,950
- I won't keep all, I'll keep one.

82
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,160
- What if you taped them together

83
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,389
and had one mega pregnancy test?

84
00:02:21,389 --> 00:02:23,497
I swear I'm funnier in real life

85
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:24,757
than on the vlog.

86
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:25,590
- [Ellie] You are.

87
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,140
- You might not think I'm
funny on the vlogs at all,

88
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,090
but I'm funny and I'm
not afraid to admit it.

89
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,290
Ellie was just like,
okay, this is my plan.

90
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,750
In this box up here--

91
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,790
- These are my nicknacks
and this is my letters.

92
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,440
- Yeah and I was like well don't forget

93
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,614
that you have some patty
wacks that you need

94
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:40,230
to include there too.

95
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,063
- And it was funny.

96
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:41,930
- It was funny.

97
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:44,761
Everyone is just like oh gross Jared,

98
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:45,760
that was a terrible joke,

99
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,930
but in the moment, it was funny.

100
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:49,230
Okay, I'm funny.

101
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,820
- I think it's important
when you toss something

102
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,058
that means a lot to you,

103
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:54,450
you should find and replicate it,

104
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,870
buy it again, use it,
take a picture of it,

105
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,340
and in our case, we're filming it.

106
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,474
- And then as hard as it is,

107
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:04,920
I kinda agree, this backpack
has a lot of meaning for me,

108
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,300
but I will never use it,

109
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,956
so I'm just gonna get another one.

110
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,210
- [Ellie] Well I said
you should order one.

111
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:12,400
- Because honestly, I
think the zipper's broken.

112
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,460
The straps are, my dog Wrinkles
I think, got to the straps.

113
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,420
Or something like that.

114
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,690
- [Ellie] Where'd you get it?

115
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,523
- In Finland.

116
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:20,356
- [Ellie] Yeah, it looks nice.

117
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:22,080
- This is what it was, yeah I remember,

118
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,045
there's a giant hole in the bottom.

119
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:25,140
- [Ellie] He used it
to school all the time.

120
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,230
- I used it in Finland

121
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,060
and then I used it for school.

122
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,430
But yeah, there's a
giant hole in the bottom,

123
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,910
so it's not usable, but
I'll just get another one.

124
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,480
- Take a picture, so we know
the brand and everything--

125
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,660
- HaglÃ¶fs

126
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,700
- [Ellie] Got it.

127
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Okay last thing and
then we'll move on guys.

128
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,000
I made Jared a get better soon card

129
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,903
and then Julie, Mom, my dad, me,

130
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:50,032
and Landon all wrote on it.

131
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:50,913
- [Jared] Awww.

132
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,090
- Do you want me to read 'em real quick?

133
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,110
- [Jared] Sure just real quick.

134
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,000
- I said Hobble, because
we used to call each other,

135
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
I used to call you Hobble.

136
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,260
- And we got that bear
that was named Hobble.

137
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,310
- Yes, that was cute.

138
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,640
Roses are red, violets are blue,

139
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,540
if you can't chase me,

140
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,509
then I'll chase you.

141
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:07,219
(laughing)

142
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,052
Cute.

143
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,060
- Because I couldn't run?

144
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,927
- Yes.

145
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:13,710
Mom says I'll bet the nurses and doctors

146
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,269
just love you, you're such
a positive, happy person.

147
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,029
You'll heal fast because of your attitude

148
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,209
and I know the days
ahead will not be easy,

149
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:21,469
but you'll have a lot of grit

150
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,600
and you'll do just fine.

151
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,460
We'll see you in a couple of days, my mom.

152
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:26,124
That's so cute, ah!

153
00:04:26,124 --> 00:04:29,220
Guess what we're doing today girl.

154
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,940
Guess what we're doing today?

155
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,750
We are doing what Mama likes best.

156
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,514
We are doing what the kids love.

157
00:04:36,514 --> 00:04:41,060
We are finally making some bath bombs.

158
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,550
- Ready boys, follow me.

159
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,660
Follow me.

160
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,670
- [Ellie] We're gonna make
something that you love.

161
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,384
What do you think we're gonna make?

162
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:53,997
- What the heck?
- Take a look.

163
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,910
- Why is there Spiderman?

164
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,799
- [Ellie] What do you
think this looks like?

165
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,047
- Here's Joke.
- What is it?

166
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:03,350
- Is that the joker?
_ It's the Joker!

167
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,269
- What do you think that looks like?

168
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:05,448
- I don't know.

169
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,840
- [Jared] Like a big ball?

170
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,000
- We're gonna make bath bombs.

171
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,630
Are you guys ready to make bath bombs

172
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,598
with toys in it?

173
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:12,431
- Yeah.

174
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,010
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

175
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,620
- Which toy do you choose, Cal?

176
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,190
- I want this one.

177
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,023
- [Ellie] That one?

178
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:19,856
- This one.

179
00:05:19,856 --> 00:05:21,713
- [Ellie] And you want
Flash and Spiderman.

180
00:05:21,713 --> 00:05:22,546
- Yes.

181
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:24,070
- Okay, Jackson, do you
want to do the first one?

182
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,180
- Yes.

183
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,860
- Good job, okay.

184
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,670
- Two cups baking soda.

185
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
- One cup--

186
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,400
- Corn starch.

187
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,511
- Corn stuff.

188
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,083
(laughing)

189
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:38,416
- [Jared] That was adorable.

190
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:41,470
- Why is it so funny?

191
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,373
- [Jared] Calvin say, one cup.

192
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:44,380
- One cup.

193
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,567
- [Jared] Corn starch.

194
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,650
- Corn stoch.

195
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,284
- One cup citric acid.

196
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:54,786
- On cup of delicious Epsom salt.

197
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:56,210
Oooop.

198
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,860
- I'm mixing all our dry
ingredients together.

199
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,920
The kids are occupied with the toys.

200
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,990
I should've given that to
them when we were ready.

201
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,480
- There's two main parts
to making these bath bombs.

202
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,330
These are like the do
it yourself versions,

203
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,770
there's dry ingredients
and then wet ingredients.

204
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,170
You mix all of the dry
ingredients together first

205
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,610
and then you slowly mix
in the wet ingredients,

206
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,286
as to not make the
chemical reaction happen

207
00:06:21,286 --> 00:06:23,580
while you're making the bath bombs.

208
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,692
Oh no Jackson, do you have the flash mask

209
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,830
on Spiderman's head?

210
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,022
- No.

211
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,940
- [Jared] Thought that's what happened.

212
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,840
I was worried for a second.

213
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,190
You said his head was stuck.

214
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,440
You got 'em all together?

215
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,140
Hi, my name is Peter Parker.

216
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,543
Oh I'm spider man.

217
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:41,210
- Four teaspoon oil.

218
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:44,319
(laughing)

219
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,326
- No Calvin.

220
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:46,640
Essential oil.

221
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,950
- You know in our family,
we use a ton of bath bombs

222
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,310
so we've actually
doubled the normal recipe

223
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,930
that you can find online.

224
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,110
So more bath bombs, more fun.

225
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,102
- Yeah, Jared just wanted to do a handful,

226
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:00,930
I was like, no, we are doing all of them.

227
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,164
- [Jared] All of these.

228
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:04,840
- We're doing a teaspoon of oil.

229
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,150
So this is coconut oil.

230
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,324
I think you can use any oils,

231
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:09,890
I've even seen people using body oil, so.

232
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,520
- [Jared] Yeah, olive oil, almond oil,

233
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,380
any of those oils.

234
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,720
Let's say oils, say oil.

235
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,553
- Oil.

236
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:19,386
- Say oil.

237
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:20,319
- Oyie.

238
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,410
(bright music)

239
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,830
- [Jared] So now we're just slowly adding

240
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,150
the wet ingredients to
the dry ingredients.

241
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,320
This is our very first time,

242
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,720
so we're probably gonna make one mistake.

243
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,403
- Who wants to do the soap coloring?

244
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:34,573
- Me.

245
00:07:34,573 --> 00:07:36,573
- One, two, three, four.

246
00:07:39,987 --> 00:07:40,820
- Perfect.

247
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:46,977
- Okay Mom, you're kind of spilling it.

248
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,890
- [Jared] There we go, I
was getting a little worried

249
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,889
about the color, but I
think it's turning out--

250
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,690
- Yeah, I did a lot more than four drops.

251
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,365
- [Jared] It smells good,
like it just smells--

252
00:08:00,365 --> 00:08:02,180
- Lavender and lemon.

253
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,345
- [Jared] Mmmm.

254
00:08:03,345 --> 00:08:04,178
- Mmmm.

255
00:08:04,178 --> 00:08:05,100
- [Jared] Does that smell good bud?

256
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,360
- Tastes good.

257
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,050
- No don't, don't taste it.
- No it doesn't.

258
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,684
- [Jared] Okay what's
our next color buddy?

259
00:08:09,684 --> 00:08:10,517
- Green.

260
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:11,511
- [Jared] Green, alright.

261
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:12,649
- [Ellie] Let's see it.

262
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:14,118
Good job, let's try that.
- Good.

263
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,500
- Okay Calvin, what color are you doing?

264
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,630
- Yellow.

265
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,650
- [Jared] Yellow.

266
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,540
- [Ellie] It's kinda orange.

267
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,373
- [Calvin] Now me!

268
00:08:22,413 --> 00:08:23,310
- [Jackson] Why is there a heart?

269
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,720
- Good job.
- Good job bud.

270
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,460
- [Jared] Okay we've got
blue, we've got green

271
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,840
and then that's kind
of an orangish yellow.

272
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,820
- Calvin, where's your little Lego?

273
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,070
Let's lay 'em all out.

274
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,253
- [Jared] Which one do
you want to put inside?

275
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,315
- I want to do Ironman.

276
00:08:37,315 --> 00:08:38,240
- So this will be yours.

277
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay so what I want you to do

278
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,289
is take this,

279
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,425
and scrape some blue in it.

280
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:44,259
Perfect.

281
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:47,280
You put your toy inside.

282
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,050
Okay now say I'll see you in the tub.

283
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,780
- I'll see you in the tub.

284
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,030
- Okay oh.
- Oh.

285
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,763
- [Jared] Okay, make it snap,

286
00:08:57,763 --> 00:08:59,550
oh that's gonna look so cool.

287
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,610
- It's gonna be like a marble.

288
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,760
- [Jared] Alright, this one
actually looks really cool.

289
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
We're gonna put it in the freezer,

290
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
so we can have it sooner.

291
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,410
Usually, you'll have to let them sit

292
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,480
for 24 hours,

293
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,060
but I think in the freezer for 30 minutes

294
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,893
these will work.

295
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,590
Okay Calvin, what color are you choosing?

296
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:16,824
- Green.

297
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,940
- [Jared] Green.

298
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,990
And who's your guy?

299
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,088
- Spiderman.

300
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:23,610
- [Jared] Spiderman.

301
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,302
Green and yellow.

302
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,135
- Workin' it.

303
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:26,968
- [Jared] We completely underestimated.

304
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:27,828
We doubled the recipe.

305
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:29,670
- We're going to double it again,

306
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,090
so I can use those.

307
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,585
- He wants to do two superheroes.

308
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:33,600
- [Jared] Two superheroes?

309
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,674
Oh double trouble.

310
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,543
Flash and Spiderman have
become good friends today.

311
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,853
- [Jackson] Three.

312
00:09:37,853 --> 00:09:39,040
- [Jared] Three?

313
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,983
- And Hulk.
- And Joker.

314
00:09:40,983 --> 00:09:41,900
- [Jared] And Hulk, four?

315
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,310
That is the ultimate bath bomb.

316
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,143
- I love that.

317
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,480
- [Jared] Lush take a note.

318
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,120
Alright, Calvin's is all done.

319
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,140
I think this one's gonna turn out

320
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,080
just a little bit better.

321
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,950
It's packed a little more.

322
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,610
Here we go, we'll put
it right there, awesome.

323
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,070
Okay, it's time for another round.

324
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,230
Ellie put pink all together

325
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,038
and we're going to fill
up as many as we can.

326
00:10:01,038 --> 00:10:03,621
(lively music)

327
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,980
- I cannot wait to use this.

328
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,484
Does that look awesome?

329
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:12,317
Ah!

330
00:10:12,317 --> 00:10:13,420
- [Jared] That looks so good.

331
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,380
- [Ellie] Okay, Jackson's doing a heart.

332
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,413
- [Jared] Ellie, you're a star.

333
00:10:18,413 --> 00:10:21,716
(lively music)

334
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:22,812
- Awesome, do another one.

335
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:24,880
- [Jared] He did that all by himself.

336
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,750
That's awesome.

337
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,369
Good job Calvin.

338
00:10:28,369 --> 00:10:29,670
Pack that one.
- Now pack this one.

339
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,503
- [Jared] Don't close it yet,

340
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:31,479
you gotta put stuff in the other one.

341
00:10:31,479 --> 00:10:32,760
Yeah, there you go.

342
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,720
Flip it around.

343
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,226
- His face.

344
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:39,180
- I know.

345
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,190
- You did awesome.

346
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,130
- [Jared] You did so good.

347
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,674
- Good job Calvin.

348
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:47,507
- Thanks Mom.

349
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:48,785
- You're welcome.

350
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:50,481
- Let's go put 'em in the fridge.

351
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:53,030
(lively music)

352
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,450
Look at all these bath bombs.

353
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,283
- [Ellie] And ice cream.

354
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:57,180
- [Jared] Mmm, yum.

355
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,220
- Is grapes in water yummy mister?

356
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,540
I am getting dinner ready.

357
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,284
The kids have come up a thousand times,

358
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:06,100
can we get our bath bombs out?

359
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,910
And I'm like no, not until bed time.

360
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,950
I've got some steamed vegetables going on

361
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,010
and this is one of my favorite meals.

362
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,950
This is Hello Fresh,

363
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,280
it's chicken, bell pepper.

364
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,590
I always put pico de gallo on mine.

365
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,350
Jared is a little more simple

366
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,103
and doesn't like that, so he
just has cheese and chicken

367
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,790
and the kids have cheese,

368
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,020
so we're throwing this in the oven,

369
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,770
and we're getting ready to eat.

370
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,604
And mister is playing
with grapes and water,

371
00:11:33,604 --> 00:11:37,610
so you know, whatever entertains him.

372
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:40,150
- So we had dinner and boys,

373
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,440
I think it's time to
check on the bath bombs.

374
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
You ready for this?

375
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,880
- Yeah!

376
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,890
- [Jared] Let's grab some.

377
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,090
Now here's what we're gonna do,

378
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,590
let's start off with these little ones,

379
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,070
and we're gonna test 'em out okay?

380
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,650
You got 'em?
- Open them up.

381
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,640
- [Jared] Yeah let's open up 'em.

382
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,400
Here, let's go over here.

383
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,750
Yeah, let's open 'em up and we'll see.

384
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,659
Oh my goodness.

385
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,326
- Put your hand out.

386
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:03,040
- [Jared] Yes!

387
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,350
We've got a bath bomb.

388
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,570
Wait, not yet, not yet, not yet,

389
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,761
we gotta get Calvin's.
- Wait for Calvin's.

390
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,570
- [Jared] Oh yes, the heart worked.

391
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,470
- The stars were hard, open your hand.

392
00:12:12,827 --> 00:12:14,171
- [Jared] Yay!

393
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,796
- Yeah!

394
00:12:15,796 --> 00:12:17,908
- What do you think?

395
00:12:17,908 --> 00:12:18,986
- Let's put them in the water.

396
00:12:18,986 --> 00:12:20,297
- [Jared] You want to
put them in the water?

397
00:12:20,297 --> 00:12:21,464
One two three.

398
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:24,510
- Ah!

399
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,320
That looks awesome.
- Yeah!

400
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,140
- You made your own.

401
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:29,973
Good job.

402
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,300
- What about the toys?

403
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,660
- [Ellie] And the toys
are in your big ones.

404
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,760
We'll take a bath.

405
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,850
- [Jared] Do you guys hear that?

406
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,683
- [Jackson] Yeah.

407
00:12:35,683 --> 00:12:36,645
- This is lavender.

408
00:12:36,645 --> 00:12:38,580
You want to put the star in there Cal?

409
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,430
- [Jared] It looks more pink in real life

410
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,263
than in camera,.

411
00:12:41,263 --> 00:12:43,340
In camera, it looks almost orange.

412
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,322
That's so funny.
- Oh.

413
00:12:45,322 --> 00:12:47,290
- It smells amazing.

414
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,560
It feels good.

415
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,393
- [Jared] Good job.

416
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,276
- I'm impressed with the fizziness.

417
00:12:50,276 --> 00:12:52,940
- [Jared] Yeah, it fizzed really good.

418
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,566
- I do like how Lush's foam.

419
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,440
That's pretty cool.
- Yeah.

420
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,770
- This definitely fizzed more than foamed.

421
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,087
- But this is awesome.

422
00:13:00,087 --> 00:13:01,310
Yay, we made our own.

423
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,891
- [Jared] Guys we did it.

424
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:04,398
Whoa.

425
00:13:04,398 --> 00:13:06,280
- [Ellie] Oh I broke the heart.

426
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,500
- [Jared] Oh no, my heart's broken.

427
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,567
- Okay, I do think it is best,

428
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,620
we froze ours for a little
bit to make it sturdy,

429
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:16,551
but next time we'll just
leave them overnight.

430
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,530
- [Jared] Overnight, yeah.

431
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,830
- Or just for a few hours.

432
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,664
Because they're still soft.

433
00:13:20,664 --> 00:13:21,907
- This is so cool.

434
00:13:21,907 --> 00:13:22,966
- [Jared] You like it?

435
00:13:22,966 --> 00:13:23,799
- Yeah.

436
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,190
- [Jared] Awesome bud, I'm
glad you're having fun.

437
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,360
- How exciting that we made our own.

438
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,680
We're gonna make more too, okay?

439
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,970
- [Jared] You know what's
gonna be even more fun?

440
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,365
When you do this in the bath tub.

441
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:35,198
- [Ellie] With your huge ones.

442
00:13:35,198 --> 00:13:36,910
- [Jared] Yeah, with the toys.

443
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:38,860
Alright, let's put this in.

444
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,530
- [Calvin] Now me!

445
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:44,360
- It smells so good, I love this smell.

446
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:47,300
Ah.

447
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,560
- We're gonna be doing this a lot,

448
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,079
because every time they
take a bath, they ask me,

449
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:52,080
- [Jackson] Look!

450
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,850
- Do we have any bath bombs?

451
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,500
- [Jared] Yay.

452
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,455
- I'm gonna let these
just sit for a few hours.

453
00:13:57,455 --> 00:13:58,598
- [Jared] Kinda get to room temperature.

454
00:13:58,598 --> 00:13:59,870
- And then I'm gonna put 'em in,

455
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,080
I always put 'em in my dish.

456
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,260
and this bad boy, too bad
there's not a pearl in there.

457
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,050
- [Jared] Oh fail, Dad fail.

458
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,030
- No, it's cute.

459
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,562
- [Jared] I wonder if the
metal ones will break apart

460
00:14:10,562 --> 00:14:12,810
easier than the plastic ones.

461
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,430
I mean it won't cut through.

462
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,860
- So we just found this online

463
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,450
that a lot of people use.

464
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,370
I was trying to find how to
make an ultimate fancy one

465
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,300
like with other stuff, so I
didn't really see anything

466
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,580
other than this, but if
you guys have made some

467
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,333
that you know I'd like,

468
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:31,890
because you know I love bath bombs,

469
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:32,940
please let me know,

470
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,210
because I want to keep doing this.

471
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,180
I think it would be nice,

472
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,510
because it's fun to do with the kids.

473
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,960
It took up our whole day, playing,

474
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,729
cleaning up, making 'em, so.

475
00:14:41,729 --> 00:14:42,562
- [Jared] Yeah.

476
00:14:42,562 --> 00:14:44,508
- I would love to do more of it.

477
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,980
- I'm gonna put my face in the water.

478
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,940
- [Jared] You want to put
your face in the water?

479
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,773
- Yeah.

480
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:49,606
- Go ahead.
- How about in the bath tub?

481
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:50,500
- [Jared] Oh right now?

482
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,930
Okay, Mom gave you the
approval, go for it.

483
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:53,973
Mom's giving you a bath anyway.

484
00:14:53,973 --> 00:14:55,060
- [Ellie] I don't know if you would do it,

485
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,367
we'll see, try it.

486
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,799
- [Jared] Do it do it do it

487
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,380
do it do it do it!

488
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:04,090
- He just laughs.

489
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,390
- [Jared] Alright, we gotta clean up now

490
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,320
that we made this,

491
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
actually it wasn't a big mess at all.

492
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,030
And it's clean stuff, so
it kinda just works out.

493
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,560
Nice contribution, Calvin.

494
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,570
Really appreciate that.

495
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,467
- Jackson's is done, guys.

496
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:17,300
(running water)

497
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,010
I am so impressed.

498
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,600
- [Jared] Doesn't that look so good?

499
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,000
That looks like it came
directly from Lush.

500
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,520
Let's see Calvin's.
- It's beautiful.

501
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,280
- Why have we not been doing this?

502
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,440
- [Jackson] Ironman!

503
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,961
- [Jared] He dropped it in.

504
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,878
- The water is so cool.

505
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,340
- Wow, that's amazing.

506
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,160
Oh how perfect is this?

507
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,530
It smells so good.

508
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,499
Oh my gosh.

509
00:15:40,499 --> 00:15:43,200
- [Ellie] Why did we not do this sooner?

510
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,220
- This is so cool.

511
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,150
I definitely see it is a little soft,

512
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,260
so I think letting it sit for 24 hours

513
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,890
is the best idea,

514
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,280
but we wanted to do it right away,

515
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,113
have some fun.

516
00:15:54,113 --> 00:15:55,567
It's so cool.

517
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,348
(Penny barking)

518
00:15:58,348 --> 00:15:59,181
(Jared laughing)

519
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:00,260
- [Ellie] What does she see?

520
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,510
- [Jared] I have no idea.

521
00:16:04,332 --> 00:16:06,203
(Penny growling)

522
00:16:06,203 --> 00:16:07,890
- Hey hey, it's okay, hey hey.

523
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:08,723
- [Jared] It's the clothes on the bed.

524
00:16:08,723 --> 00:16:11,146
- Hey hey hey hey it's okay.

525
00:16:11,146 --> 00:16:13,311
(Penny barks)

526
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,561
Look it's okay.

527
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,840
Off off off off.

528
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,720
- Penny, good girl.

529
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,020
What a good guard dog.

530
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,932
What, you're okay, it's okay.

531
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:24,771
- Holy crapola.

532
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:26,010
- [Jared] I know.

533
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,145
You okay?

534
00:16:27,145 --> 00:16:28,331
You good now?
- Good girl.

535
00:16:28,331 --> 00:16:29,970
- I know.
- You did good.

536
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,803
- As if someone was on my bed.

537
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,020
- [Jared] Yeah, good girl.

538
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:34,021
- That was intense.

539
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:34,910
- That was.

540
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm like that's silly,

541
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,690
but at the same time, it's like, good.

542
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,330
- She saw something she didn't like.

543
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,210
- Yeah.

544
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,237
- She said usually Mom's bed's perfect.

545
00:16:43,237 --> 00:16:47,020
- [Jared] Hey, you a little riled up now.

546
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,360
Your tail was sticking up

547
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,367
and your stripe on your
back was sticking up too,

548
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,200
I like that.

549
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,790
- And the thing is, she didn't even

550
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,870
go in there and see.

551
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,560
She barely walked in and then
she instantly came out, grrr.

552
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,530
and then went back in was like--

553
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,397
- [Jared] Yeah.

554
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,300
- [Ellie] What the heck?

555
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,700
- Good girl, that's my girl.

556
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:09,279
It's okay, yeah see it's okay.

557
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:13,170
(Jared laughing)

558
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,619
What a silly dog.

559
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,759
Sometimes in my office,

560
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,900
she will bark in the
reflection of the window.

561
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,710
So sometimes I'm wondering,

562
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,780
does she see herself in the mirror?

563
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,580
On the nightstand?

564
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:27,640
Unless someone's under the bed.

565
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,290
Nope, no one's under the bed,

566
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,630
so I think we're in the clear.

567
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,310
- Alright, my final thing
about the bath bombs,

568
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,480
they were amazing,

569
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I don't think I love
these stars and hearts.

570
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,850
Almost every single one of them

571
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,100
have broken in half,

572
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,070
but that could totally be our fault,

573
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,360
because we didn't let
it really really set.

574
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,630
So we're gonna try 'em again sometime

575
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,580
and let it set more,

576
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,160
before we try and take it apart.

577
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,653
This is that shell one.

578
00:17:56,653 --> 00:17:58,730
If feels pretty good, but
I'm not gonna take it out

579
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,790
until tomorrow when I know
it's really really set,

580
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,640
because I want to use that bad boy.

581
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
And I'll let the kids use these

582
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,430
and play with those as they take baths.

583
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,440
That was fun.

584
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,990
Like I said, please please tell me

585
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,170
if there's other fun things
I should add in there.

586
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,590
Like I was like, should
I shred a real lemon

587
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,171
and put stuff in there, I
don't know, let me know.

588
00:18:18,171 --> 00:18:20,900
But we'll see you guys next
time, thank you so much

589
00:18:20,900 --> 00:00:00,000
for watching, I'm cleaning
up my mess, see ya.
