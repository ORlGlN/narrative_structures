1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,718
- While Jared and I were gone,

2
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:05,731
Jared came up with this awesome idea.

3
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:07,237
So I think that you should explain it.

4
00:00:07,237 --> 00:00:09,225
- Alright, well we know the
internet is a funny place.

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:11,281
There are some weird
corners of the internet.

6
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:13,484
And we have gone to some of those corners.

7
00:00:13,484 --> 00:00:16,317
Maybe not all the way into
that corner, but nonetheless.

8
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:18,146
- We're getting close though.

9
00:00:18,146 --> 00:00:20,895
- So I went on to Amazon
and I was just like

10
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:24,345
let's find some weird things
that Ellie may or may not use

11
00:00:24,345 --> 00:00:26,102
or I may or may not use and-

12
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:29,541
- Preferably, what we would
use, because that would be nice.

13
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,674
So we found some cool items.

14
00:00:30,674 --> 00:00:32,872
- Some cool items. Just some weird

15
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:35,046
things that we found on Amazon.

16
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,936
And we're gonna go through one by one,

17
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,701
open them up, see if they're cool.

18
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:40,010
- Test 'em out.

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,498
- And let you know about 'em.

20
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:43,206
Everything that you are going
to see here in the video

21
00:00:43,206 --> 00:00:45,390
we will have listed in
the description down below

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,466
if you're interested and
want to try for yourself.

23
00:00:47,466 --> 00:00:49,109
So should we go to the first one?

24
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,609
- Um, totes. Toilet. That one.

25
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,821
I picked Jared's items, he picked mine.

26
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,659
- Yup. This is something
that we should have had

27
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,903
for Ellie a long time ago
and maybe even Bonnie.

28
00:00:59,903 --> 00:01:01,011
- This is for you!

29
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:04,337
- This is the public toilet survival kit.

30
00:01:04,337 --> 00:01:07,079
So shall we go to a location?

31
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,414
- You dibs it.

32
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:12,034
- (singing) Doo doo doo, gotta
go potty and I'm in public.

33
00:01:12,034 --> 00:01:14,854
(fake screaming) That's disgusting!

34
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:17,430
If only had a public toilet survival kit.

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,263
(ding)

36
00:01:18,263 --> 00:01:19,096
I do!

37
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:21,993
(singing)

38
00:01:21,993 --> 00:01:23,418
- [Ellie] (laughing) This
is not an advertisement.

39
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:25,181
- This is not an advertisement, I'm just

40
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:27,773
trying to give a real-life scenario.

41
00:01:27,773 --> 00:01:29,497
So what is inside of here?

42
00:01:29,497 --> 00:01:32,454
Is this what they're calling toilet paper?

43
00:01:32,454 --> 00:01:35,371
Oh no, this is a toilet seat cover.

44
00:01:36,232 --> 00:01:38,166
So you get a toilet seat cover.

45
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,401
Just tear that out. Hello!

46
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:42,530
So we'll put that down on the toilet seat.

47
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,660
Don't worry, I've got gloves.

48
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,053
I feel like if you really
need to go to the bathroom,

49
00:01:47,053 --> 00:01:49,552
this is not going to help
at all 'cause you're like,

50
00:01:49,552 --> 00:01:51,735
oh crap, I've got to
fumble with all this stuff.

51
00:01:51,735 --> 00:01:54,469
And you get little wet naps, so that

52
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,136
will probably go on before this.

53
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:04,185
Finally.

54
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:10,547
K, be serious though.

55
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,890
Would you use this in a normal situation?

56
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:12,937
- [Ellie] Heavens, no.

57
00:02:12,937 --> 00:02:14,972
- Probably not. Oh, it's gone.

58
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:16,900
- Did it go in the
toilet? I think it's okay.

59
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,067
- I'm not gonna pull it out.
But if I did, I've got gloves.

60
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,418
- You know what's really
good though, that.

61
00:02:24,418 --> 00:02:26,594
- Oh, poopourri. No joke,

62
00:02:26,594 --> 00:02:28,626
we're fans of poopourri in the house.

63
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,176
- I don't think I would ever use that.

64
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:31,619
I think that would give me anxiety

65
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,166
and I would swear up a storm.

66
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,416
- Yeah. Just flush it down.

67
00:02:36,715 --> 00:02:40,044
- I don't know how I feel about this.

68
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:42,490
Jared got lip plumpers for me.

69
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,085
- You always say that
my lips are just little.

70
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,238
- You do have little lips.

71
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:50,081
I don't ever have a
desire to have full lips

72
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:52,298
because I like my lips, but this will

73
00:02:52,298 --> 00:02:54,067
be interesting to see if this works.

74
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:57,066
So we're gonna test this
out and if it does work-

75
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,505
- Maybe you'll have me do it all the time.

76
00:02:58,505 --> 00:03:00,028
- Do it for date night,
so I have plump lips.

77
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:03,687
- You'll enjoy kissing
my lips more than you do.

78
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:07,127
- Make sure your lips are clean.

79
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:09,160
- Wait, let me see your lips.

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,464
- I thought you were gonna
lick them for me. Oh.

81
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:14,811
Luckily, it came with two.
Jared didn't know that.

82
00:03:14,811 --> 00:03:17,247
We were just gonna share
one, but now we get our own.

83
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:20,563
- That's more hygienic.
You can do the other bag.

84
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:22,338
- So it comes with a toothbrush,

85
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:25,369
maybe to exfoliate your lip?

86
00:03:25,369 --> 00:03:27,364
- It's probably the
brush to clean the thing.

87
00:03:27,364 --> 00:03:29,467
It comes with a thank you
card, that's nice of them.

88
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:31,351
- Step one: clean your
full lipped enhancers

89
00:03:31,351 --> 00:03:33,207
with mild soap and water. No, no.

90
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:36,999
Next, we recommend lightly
exfoliating lips, got that.

91
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:40,704
Wet the area around your lips
with water or moisturizer.

92
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,498
I would never do this.

93
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:43,794
The moisture's not necessary but

94
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:45,487
may help establish tighter suction

95
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,552
which is key to a good result.

96
00:03:47,552 --> 00:03:49,191
- I've never blushed my lips before.

97
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:52,367
- Don't do it too hard, you
don't to- I've done that before.

98
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:54,383
Position your fuller lips above your area,

99
00:03:54,383 --> 00:03:55,703
hold tightly into place, and begin

100
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,203
to suck in short puffs of air.

101
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:04,164
Let your lips relax and then
the enhancer will improve.

102
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:04,997
Oh wow.

103
00:04:06,501 --> 00:04:07,918
How do you do it?

104
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:11,601
(suction noises)

105
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:14,932
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

106
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:20,040
Begin sucking short puffs
of air out of your enhancer.

107
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,278
- Hmm? Mm?

108
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,387
- I don't know if I'm doing it right.

109
00:04:23,387 --> 00:04:24,470
- Mm, mm, mm.

110
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,771
- They're purple!

111
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,135
- They definitely feel a little bigger.

112
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:33,552
- They're purple!

113
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,254
- Is that bad?

114
00:04:36,254 --> 00:04:39,932
- They are full. I don't know.
I was trying to do it right.

115
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:41,182
Mm, mm, mm hmm.

116
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,963
- Okay, just keep it
in there for a minute.

117
00:04:44,963 --> 00:04:47,286
Ow, my lips hurt real bad, Napoleon.

118
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:51,120
So it's literally just a
plastic thing for suction.

119
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,355
I feel like I could do
the same thing with a cup.

120
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:55,272
Ready? One, two, three.

121
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,171
I think they do a difference.

122
00:05:00,171 --> 00:05:01,143
Whoa!

123
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,403
- It's all itchy. Purple?

124
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,641
- Yeah, they're definitely purple.

125
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:06,556
This is probably not
good, because you have

126
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,314
a giant ring around your lips
and then it's all purple.

127
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:11,147
- Ah, my face is itchy

128
00:05:12,619 --> 00:05:14,869
(snorting)

129
00:05:15,758 --> 00:05:16,675
in my nose.

130
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:20,131
- Did you hear that?

131
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:24,175
- I just (groan) my face.

132
00:05:24,175 --> 00:05:25,293
I mean would I really do this

133
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,979
before getting ready for the day?

134
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:27,812
- No.

135
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:29,630
- No, it would be a lot of work.

136
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,665
Just overline your lips
and not my favorite.

137
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,148
That kind of hurt.

138
00:05:34,148 --> 00:05:37,080
- I'm going to be going like
this for the rest of the day.

139
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,330
Next up, we've got a self-stirring mug.

140
00:05:41,556 --> 00:05:42,912
- I got this for Jared. I thought

141
00:05:42,912 --> 00:05:44,477
the kids would actually love it though.

142
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:45,604
- Especially with chocolate milk.

143
00:05:45,604 --> 00:05:47,798
- 'Cause every morning, at
least when it's been cold,

144
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,685
I've made the kids
chocolate milk and I stir it

145
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:53,279
and I think that they would
think that this was cute.

146
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,389
So I kind of got this
for you and the boys.

147
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,450
- Just in case you forgot, they have

148
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,268
it on the label. Self stirring mug.

149
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:01,249
- Did they have to do that?

150
00:06:01,249 --> 00:06:02,946
- So there's a cap on here.

151
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,485
- Amazing. That's a cool mug.

152
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,173
- Yeah, so you can have a hot chocolate

153
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:07,871
and stuff and all that, but there's

154
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,215
a little yellow button
on here that says stir.

155
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,420
- Let me go get the stuff to put in it.

156
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,630
- Oh and two triple A
batteries from my office.

157
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,587
Needs batteries. Batteries
are not included.

158
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,366
- K, spoon, water.

159
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:21,570
- Ooh! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

160
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,750
- Yeah, it's hot dude.

161
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,269
- Yeah, that's hot. I was just seeing.

162
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:27,727
- Yeah, we're gonna drink it.

163
00:06:27,727 --> 00:06:29,565
- K, let's put the bottom on.

164
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:31,282
Alright, so the big question is

165
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:33,760
how many scoops of cocoa to the water?

166
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,180
- Oh I would say like three.

167
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,183
- Three, that's actually
what I would say too.

168
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:38,127
That's what I've done my whole life.

169
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:38,960
- Heaping.

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,985
- Yeah, do not go light on the scoops.

171
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,535
They're definitely big scoops,

172
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,734
but three scoops. There we go.

173
00:06:45,734 --> 00:06:48,244
- It's gonna be weird not to stir it.

174
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:49,077
- Ready?

175
00:06:49,077 --> 00:06:49,910
- Yeah.

176
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,655
(grinding noise)

177
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:57,963
The kids are going to love this.

178
00:06:57,963 --> 00:06:59,546
Are you kidding me?

179
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:06,966
They are gonna love that. I love it.

180
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:09,880
- It sounds intense!

181
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:13,375
That's a mixed cocoa.

182
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:14,986
- So good!

183
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,360
- That is so cool!

184
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,555
- The kids are going to fight
over that in the morning.

185
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:19,860
- That is awesome.

186
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,547
- This is a good Christmas
gift, by the way. I love it.

187
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:27,242
- I got Bryan and Cullen and
me the never spilling mug

188
00:07:27,242 --> 00:07:31,045
and I think I might get
them that this year.

189
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:33,306
- You give them mugs every year?

190
00:07:33,306 --> 00:07:35,390
Those mugs were cool but you shouldn't

191
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,086
put them in the dishwasher 'cause it-

192
00:07:37,086 --> 00:07:38,434
- Makes that steel go away.

193
00:07:38,434 --> 00:07:39,772
- Dang it.

194
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:41,963
- Anyway, let's move on.
Let's move on to the next one.

195
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,428
This is not a poop emoji.

196
00:07:43,428 --> 00:07:44,739
- I don't know what this is.

197
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,434
- Do you know what this is?
I'll give you one guess.

198
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:47,479
- Did I get it or did you get it?

199
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:49,698
- I got it for you. Let me
know in the comments down below

200
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:51,208
before proceeding further in the video,

201
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,681
what you think this is.

202
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,527
- Sleeping bag. Jacket.

203
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:55,609
- Let's open it up.

204
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,562
Ready to hear the air come out?

205
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:00,062
(air rushing)

206
00:08:01,612 --> 00:08:02,897
Holy cow, it expands.

207
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:05,730
- What is it? What? There's hands.

208
00:08:06,784 --> 00:08:08,694
Is that a belly button? Or a nipple.

209
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,277
- No it's a nipple.

210
00:08:11,313 --> 00:08:12,792
- What is this?

211
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,728
- Did you get this for
me for the airplane?

212
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,974
- No, well not necessarily
for the airplane.

213
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,149
It's a lot smaller than I thought.

214
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,507
- What did you get it for?

215
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:22,367
- This is a cuddle buddy.

216
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,837
- Calvin might like it.

217
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,665
- If you want to cuddle with someone.

218
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:27,330
- Aww.

219
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,065
- There. That's 'cause my arm keeps

220
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,714
falling asleep when we cuddle.

221
00:08:32,714 --> 00:08:34,791
It actually might be good on the airplane.

222
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,392
You know, when we were traveling one time,

223
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,662
I saw, you know how they have
the neck pillows like that,

224
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:40,280
they're just really small?

225
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,846
I saw someone with, what are they called?

226
00:08:41,846 --> 00:08:42,679
- Boppy.

227
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,719
- A boppy, like a giant
baby carrier thing,

228
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,988
around their head. It was hilarious.

229
00:08:46,988 --> 00:08:49,190
- This actually I think we
should bring on the flight.

230
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,343
It actually might be really nice.

231
00:08:51,343 --> 00:08:53,246
- Ellie, you just want to
play with his nipple. Stop it.

232
00:08:53,246 --> 00:08:56,388
- He's like what the heck? There, there.

233
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:59,204
- In a realistic situation,
would you use this?

234
00:08:59,204 --> 00:09:01,649
- Yeah, I'm really
thinking I should bring it.

235
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:02,874
The neck pillows on airplanes

236
00:09:02,874 --> 00:09:04,143
really are not that comfortable.

237
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,278
I think we should bring it.

238
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,016
Where's the lip suckers?

239
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:08,561
- Sorry, I was sleeping.

240
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,382
- That's awesome. I
actually really like it

241
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:13,784
and we will use it.
Thanks. I think we will.

242
00:09:13,784 --> 00:09:15,138
- Who comes up with this?

243
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,277
Like an actual, realistic-looking arm.

244
00:09:17,277 --> 00:09:18,801
- Totes. It's like 11:30 at night

245
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,914
so I kind of want to use it now.

246
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,864
- It's modeled after my body, by the way.

247
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,804
Next up, we've got something fun, I think.

248
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:29,554
It's carbonated bubble clay mask.

249
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:35,550
- I'm a mask sucker. I like
to do masks on my skin.

250
00:09:36,864 --> 00:09:38,624
So Jared thought this might be really fun.

251
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,702
I'm really wondering if there's a benefit

252
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:42,566
for it though or if it's
just for fun and games

253
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,957
'cause I'm looking at it and I

254
00:09:43,957 --> 00:09:46,761
don't see any sort of benefits.

255
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:51,716
It's made in Korea. A lot
of Korean, so I can't read.

256
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,121
- Yeah, there's a lot of Korean on the box

257
00:09:53,121 --> 00:09:55,056
but here's the thing is, is
there going to be anything

258
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:57,266
inside of it that's gonna burn our skin?

259
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,208
- Carbonated? It totally could.

260
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,259
- Oh geez, this could be bad.

261
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:02,092
Ugh.

262
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:06,840
Oh, that smells not bad.

263
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,301
- Not bad, decent.

264
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:11,220
- Another face item that we
have in a much smaller package.

265
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,935
If you can't tell what this
is, these are gold foil sheets.

266
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:17,854
Actual 24 carat gold sheets.

267
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:20,926
- No, it is not. I do not believe that.

268
00:10:20,926 --> 00:10:25,135
If it was real 24 carat gold,
it would have been expensive.

269
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:27,221
- Maybe it is, I don't
know. These are so small.

270
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,716
- No, I remember seeing the cost.

271
00:10:28,716 --> 00:10:32,555
- But there's 20 sheets and
they're just tiny little guys.

272
00:10:32,555 --> 00:10:34,867
- I don't know if I believe
that it's really 24 carat.

273
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,413
I think it would've been
an expensive face mask.

274
00:10:37,413 --> 00:10:40,376
- Do you think people would
just go on the internet and lie?

275
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:41,582
- Let me see how much it was.

276
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,490
- No. There's twenty sheets in here.

277
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,392
You put them on your
face like little squares.

278
00:10:45,392 --> 00:10:47,619
It's another mask. So should we do

279
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,978
one person does the gold foil and

280
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,412
one person does the carbonated thing?

281
00:10:51,412 --> 00:10:52,245
- Yeah.

282
00:10:52,245 --> 00:10:54,088
K, so far I'm seeing larger masks,

283
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:56,604
so not these, and they're like ten bucks.

284
00:10:56,604 --> 00:10:59,617
I don't believe that it's real 24 carat.

285
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,156
I think that's a lie.

286
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,987
- Who knows? Let's go put it on our face.

287
00:11:03,987 --> 00:11:06,644
- I just gotta remove my makeup first.

288
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:09,814
- Sounds like sandpaper on my
face 'cause of my whiskers.

289
00:11:09,814 --> 00:11:11,228
- Don't scrub too hard.

290
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:12,735
Don't want to hurt that precious skin

291
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:15,162
that you're putting 24 carat gold on.

292
00:11:15,162 --> 00:11:16,375
- Do you think this will increase

293
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:17,627
the value of my face at all?

294
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:18,460
- Totes.

295
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,128
- Good. Money maker. You ready for this?

296
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,359
- Yes.

297
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:25,139
- So you have the
carbonated bubble clay mask

298
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,183
and I have the gold sheets.

299
00:11:28,183 --> 00:11:30,075
- I'm just nervous it's
gonna burn my skin.

300
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:32,205
I'm really picky on what I use.

301
00:11:32,205 --> 00:11:33,437
- Neither of us can read the

302
00:11:33,437 --> 00:11:34,870
instructions on either of these.

303
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,703
- So this says about
five minutes from online.

304
00:11:39,662 --> 00:11:41,502
- It just dissolved on my fingers.

305
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,077
- Maybe this will take my blackheads away.

306
00:11:44,077 --> 00:11:45,910
- It's so like shreds.

307
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,734
- Glad it was cheap.

308
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:52,228
- There we go.

309
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:57,729
- Nice. Yeah, this isn't burning.

310
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,235
- That's a good sign!

311
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,659
- It's starting to foam
up. It feels good though.

312
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:03,619
- Does it? What does it feel like?

313
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,662
- It just feels cooling.
It's not, I thought

314
00:12:05,662 --> 00:12:09,829
it would really burn my
skin. It feels really good.

315
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:12,572
It looks hard and complicated.

316
00:12:12,572 --> 00:12:13,744
- It is.

317
00:12:13,744 --> 00:12:16,077
- Do you feel anything?
Is it liquid under it?

318
00:12:16,077 --> 00:12:18,733
- Nope. I don't feel anything.

319
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,698
- I don't understand how this is a mask.

320
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,665
It literally just
disintegrates the moment...

321
00:12:24,665 --> 00:12:27,909
What even? And you
don't have to do it wet?

322
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,920
- No, I think that if it was wet,

323
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,162
it'd ruin everything even more.

324
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,407
- K, you have a lot of these.

325
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,470
I'm just gonna try one
on my hand real quick.

326
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,081
- They don't go very far.

327
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:38,919
- That is the weirdest thing.

328
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,073
- Do you think you could just..

329
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:45,630
- Ew, you are disgusting. Why
did you do that? Is it gross?

330
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,486
- (mumbling) It's supposed to be edible!

331
00:12:47,486 --> 00:12:49,614
- It just tastes like paper?

332
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,217
It did say online they were edible

333
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,733
so he didn't just do that to be a weirdo.

334
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:55,138
Does it taste like anything?

335
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:58,364
- It doesn't taste like you
would want gold to taste.

336
00:12:58,364 --> 00:13:00,445
You want gold to taste really good.

337
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:03,109
- I feel like I look
like Squidward a little.

338
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:05,355
Look at it, it's getting fuller.

339
00:13:05,355 --> 00:13:08,345
This is kinda cool. I kind of like it.

340
00:13:08,345 --> 00:13:11,391
I could feel that if I
left this on way long,

341
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:14,312
I feel like I need to
wash it of right now.

342
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:16,422
Okay, I thought I could
leave it on long enough.

343
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:20,061
I just, I feel like this.
I'm going to wash it off.

344
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:22,322
No, no. Look at my face.

345
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:24,255
- It's so fun looking. It looks so cool.

346
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:27,326
- I look like I gained ten
pounds. Look at my cheeks.

347
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:29,198
- With mine, it looks like I've taken

348
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:31,400
gum wrappers and just put them on my face.

349
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,802
Your mileage may vary when you get these.

350
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,263
I just washed my face and I don't

351
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,487
feel better or look better.

352
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:42,193
- I feel like my face,
especially right here, is so red.

353
00:13:42,193 --> 00:13:43,936
I don't think that that would do

354
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:46,182
anything good for someone's skin.

355
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:50,562
I don't like that. Give me
the lips back. Wanna do those?

356
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,419
And for the product that we forgot about,

357
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,720
which actually could
have been the best one.

358
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Is it a bra?

359
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,100
Is it underwear?

360
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,366
You can't really see in the camera.

361
00:14:03,366 --> 00:14:06,866
It's butt implants. You can barely see it.

362
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,200
That's so weird to me.

363
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,879
- They're like butt pads.

364
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,156
- That's so weird.

365
00:14:13,156 --> 00:14:17,076
- So this is if you want
your butt to be bigger.

366
00:14:17,076 --> 00:14:18,179
- Fuller.

367
00:14:18,179 --> 00:14:21,814
- And fuller. I think one
of us should try this on.

368
00:14:21,814 --> 00:14:23,767
- I'm interested to see if it works.

369
00:14:23,767 --> 00:14:26,176
- Alright, let's get a before picture.

370
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:28,843
So boop, there it is. I like it.

371
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,291
Here is the after.

372
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,033
- K, side profile.

373
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:36,857
- Whoa! Look at that pop.

374
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:40,190
- I've got a booty. So that is the pads.

375
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:44,018
I guess I could see how someone

376
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,148
would buy it if they were getting married,

377
00:14:46,148 --> 00:14:48,191
wanted to fill out their dress, or...

378
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:51,103
I could see it. I would never wear it.

379
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:54,847
- Or if you have the
infamous nekenbum, which-

380
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:55,930
- No butt at all.

381
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:56,922
- There's no butt.

382
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:59,112
- And then there's me that has not really

383
00:14:59,112 --> 00:15:01,077
a butt so our kids are just doomed.

384
00:15:01,077 --> 00:15:03,575
- They're doomed. They're
doomed in the bum bums.

385
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:05,979
Last, but certainly not least, I know

386
00:15:05,979 --> 00:15:07,588
how much you love the hot tub.

387
00:15:07,588 --> 00:15:10,283
- I love the hot tub. I love baths.

388
00:15:10,283 --> 00:15:11,896
I have a little anxiety right now because

389
00:15:11,896 --> 00:15:13,954
it's 11:30 at night and I
haven't taken a bath today.

390
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,119
- But I figure we can bring the

391
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:19,548
hot tub into the bath with this.

392
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:23,715
- What? This is a luxury
bath turbo spa. Interesting.

393
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:27,867
- I just don't know how safe that is

394
00:15:27,867 --> 00:15:29,730
because it's got to be
powered by something.

395
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,200
- Yeah, you can see the cord hanging

396
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,111
above the water in the picture.

397
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:34,623
- In the picture. Is that like

398
00:15:34,623 --> 00:15:36,673
dropping a toaster in the tub?

399
00:15:36,673 --> 00:15:40,879
- I think that's a dumb,
a bad... It's scary.

400
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,719
- It is kind of scary. Should we try it?

401
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:43,552
- Yeah.

402
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,385
- Okay!

403
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,340
- Once. You first.

404
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,840
- Once is all that we'll need.

405
00:15:49,676 --> 00:15:51,850
Now in order to test
this last Amazon item,

406
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,006
we need to be in a little
bit more appropriate attire.

407
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:58,287
(dramatic music)

408
00:15:58,287 --> 00:15:59,120
- What are we doing?

409
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,945
- Jared and I got these swimming suits

410
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,066
for the Landing's swim party, but we

411
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:04,896
thought they may be a
little inappropriate.

412
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,921
- So what are we doing with them on now?

413
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,206
- We're going there today though,

414
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:09,813
'cause we're getting in the tub.

415
00:16:09,813 --> 00:16:11,608
- This feels weird having a swimming suit

416
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:15,468
on my body like this.
I'm not used to that.

417
00:16:15,468 --> 00:16:16,649
- This is weird.

418
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,022
- This is so weird. I can't believe

419
00:16:18,022 --> 00:16:19,188
we're doing this right now.

420
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:20,752
- I think people are gonna hate us.

421
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:22,911
- Either they're gonna hate
us or think we're funny.

422
00:16:22,911 --> 00:16:25,031
- Jet stream and bubbles, jet stream.

423
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:26,896
- So there's some lines on here

424
00:16:26,896 --> 00:16:29,756
and you're fill line, your
minimum and your maximum.

425
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:31,156
So your water has to be here.

426
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,557
So you put the suction cups on the wall.

427
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,485
That's good. Push.

428
00:16:35,485 --> 00:16:36,736
- Okay.

429
00:16:36,736 --> 00:16:38,588
- And we hit the on button.

430
00:16:38,588 --> 00:16:41,397
(splashing)

431
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,318
- But it stays in one spot.

432
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:45,254
- Yeah and you can change the direction.

433
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,278
- The kids might think that's really cool.

434
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:48,554
I don't like this.

435
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,966
K, so if you rip your thumb
nail, you can switch the dial.

436
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:52,719
- Seriously. That's a little better.

437
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:54,911
- And it has bubbles and a stream.

438
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:56,827
- Does it feel like you're in the hot tub?

439
00:16:56,827 --> 00:16:58,085
- No.

440
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,444
- I think it's more of a
hazard than it is enjoyable.

441
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:04,611
- For the work and possible
hazard, I don't love it at all.

442
00:17:06,409 --> 00:17:08,353
Usually, it's nice when
you're in a hot tub,

443
00:17:08,353 --> 00:17:11,942
to have the jet to lean on your back.

444
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:14,461
This is not, I don't, no.

445
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,848
- This is kind of weird.

446
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,902
- But I think the whole situation's weird.

447
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,134
- I'm more uncomfortable
than I want to be.

448
00:17:20,134 --> 00:17:21,550
And I imagine that you're pretty

449
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,050
uncomfortable in this situation too, so...

450
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,858
- This is not your normal vlog.

451
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:31,023
We just thought that
this would be fun to do,

452
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:34,033
so Jared thanks for the
idea, coming up with it.

453
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:35,963
- Thanks for the idea
of the swimming suits.

454
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:38,083
It was your idea.

455
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:39,974
If you have any other weird Amazon items

456
00:17:39,974 --> 00:17:41,495
that you would like us to try,

457
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:42,894
let us know in the comments down below

458
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,848
or send us an email or a
tweet or something like that.

459
00:17:44,848 --> 00:17:46,195
We would love to try them.

460
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:47,568
- So far what was your favorite?

461
00:17:47,568 --> 00:17:48,845
- Definitely the spinning mug.

462
00:17:48,845 --> 00:17:51,731
- The mug was my favorite and
I do want to order another

463
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:53,053
so the boys can each have one.

464
00:17:53,053 --> 00:17:54,405
- Yeah, actually that was pretty cool.

465
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:55,482
- What was the worst?

466
00:17:55,482 --> 00:17:57,258
- The swimming suit.

467
00:17:57,258 --> 00:18:00,596
- Well, we did buy these off
Amazon like seven months ago.

468
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,743
- Yeah. I would say the gold foil.

469
00:18:02,743 --> 00:18:06,088
The foil was just like
what is this? What is it?

470
00:18:06,088 --> 00:18:09,542
- 'Cause everything else
at least served a purpose.

471
00:18:09,542 --> 00:18:11,995
- Even though they were terrible purposes.

472
00:18:11,995 --> 00:18:15,737
- It could be useful. The
mask, I guess, if i just

473
00:18:15,737 --> 00:18:17,761
looked more into it and understood what

474
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:20,473
it did to your skin,
maybe I would like it.

475
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:22,327
- Now, I know a lot of
you guys are dying for me

476
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:25,583
to get out of this suit and
I am too, don't you worry.

477
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:27,161
I am in the same boat as you.

478
00:18:27,161 --> 00:18:28,470
So we're going to end this video.

479
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:29,880
Thank you so much for watching.

480
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,589
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.

481
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:34,509
If it was kind of weird,
still give it a big thumbs up.

482
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:37,002
- [Both] See you tomorrow. Bye!

483
00:18:37,002 --> 00:00:00,000
- Let's turn this back
on for the middle button.
