1
00:00:00,158 --> 00:00:01,708
- [Jared] I'll give you
my pickle, for a nickel.

2
00:00:01,708 --> 00:00:04,132
(laughing)

3
00:00:04,132 --> 00:00:05,746
- Why did you throw it at me?

4
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:07,266
- This guy's looking a little sad.

5
00:00:07,266 --> 00:00:09,083
I got it Ellie, Ellie
I got it, don't worry.

6
00:00:09,083 --> 00:00:11,219
Everyone, the floor is lava.

7
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:13,091
- It's definitely put me
in the holiday spirit.

8
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:14,747
I'm very excited for Thanksgiving.

9
00:00:14,747 --> 00:00:17,123
Hi, what are you doing?

10
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:17,989
- (Calvin vocalizes)

11
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,133
- You're filming?

12
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:19,966
- [Calvin] Yeah.

13
00:00:19,966 --> 00:00:23,239
- Oh Christmas tree, oh Christmas tree,

14
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,720
why are you up so early?

15
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,600
(laughing)

16
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,624
- Our tree is up.

17
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:29,839
- I know our tree is up

18
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,783
and we thought about this

19
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:34,192
and we're like, why don't
we put it up earlier?

20
00:00:34,192 --> 00:00:35,725
We were actually talking
to Cullen and Katie

21
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:37,021
about this yesterday,

22
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:38,804
like let's put up our Christmas stuff,

23
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:41,235
or just the tree anyway, early,

24
00:00:41,235 --> 00:00:42,943
because it kind of just
brings in the holiday spirit.

25
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,157
I know it's before Thanksgiving.

26
00:00:44,157 --> 00:00:45,620
People might give us grief about it,

27
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,691
I don't care one bit, because it's fun.

28
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,286
- There's a big difference between having,

29
00:00:50,286 --> 00:00:52,846
decorating your home
and making it feel cozy,

30
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:56,096
then jumping and running and doing the,

31
00:00:57,478 --> 00:00:58,599
you know what I mean?
- The Christmas ornaments.

32
00:00:58,599 --> 00:01:01,774
- Well no, not even ornaments, but,

33
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:03,788
it's just you do what you
need to do with your family.

34
00:01:03,788 --> 00:01:06,498
- [Jared] You do you boo,
is that what you're saying?

35
00:01:06,498 --> 00:01:07,331
- Yeah, I love Thanksgiving,

36
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,740
and I love getting
together with the family

37
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,988
and I just love the
feeling that it brings.

38
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:11,821
- [Jared] Yeah.

39
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,221
- I'm excited to put the wreath

40
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:14,054
on the stairs.
(bell dings)

41
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:14,887
- [Jared] Yeah.

42
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:16,084
- That's one of my favorite decorations.

43
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:18,365
- And the wreath in front of the garage.

44
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:20,877
Like that's gonna be so
stinking cool, it's huge.

45
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:22,107
But that's actually the plan

46
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:24,390
is we just have the tree up for now.

47
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,960
We're not gonna put any ornaments on it

48
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,732
until after Thanksgiving,
I think is the plan.

49
00:01:28,732 --> 00:01:30,171
- So the other night when I woke up

50
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,004
and I couldn't sleep,

51
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:32,811
I was watching my friend Ashley Hughes.

52
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:36,147
She did a DIY of how to decorate your tree

53
00:01:36,147 --> 00:01:37,039
and I feel like last year,

54
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,615
I did a really good job with our tree.

55
00:01:38,615 --> 00:01:41,272
It was my first time really really trying

56
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:42,480
and after watching her video,

57
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,337
I'm like I'm gonna do ribbon this year.

58
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:45,170
I'm gonna get more--

59
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,003
- No.

60
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:46,836
- I'm gonna get more.
- It's too much Ellie.

61
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:48,837
- The ribbon is too much.
- No I am.

62
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:51,181
- It's gonna crinkle, it's gonna cross,

63
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,539
I can't do this.

64
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,372
- No I am,

65
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:54,205
- [Jared] I can't get behind you on this.

66
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:55,312
- And I cannot wait to decorate our tree

67
00:01:55,312 --> 00:01:56,728
when the time comes.

68
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:57,821
- [Jared] I'll help you with the wreath

69
00:01:57,821 --> 00:01:58,937
around the uh
(bell dings)

70
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,117
Is that called wreath?
(bell dings)

71
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,690
What do you call it around the stairwell?

72
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,107
I don't know.
(bell dings)

73
00:02:03,107 --> 00:02:04,367
I'll help you with that.

74
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,134
You're on your own with the ribbon, sorry.

75
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:08,542
I'll give you my pickle, for a nickel.

76
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:10,868
(laughing)

77
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:13,667
- Why did you throw it at me?

78
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,948
I have a cold sore.

79
00:02:14,948 --> 00:02:16,669
Do you see it?
- Aww.

80
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,154
- You know what, Ellie's
family gets cold sores,

81
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,584
like nobody's business.

82
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,216
Like everywhere, like
all around their lips

83
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:24,041
and their noses and everything,

84
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,307
but I don't get get cold sores.

85
00:02:25,307 --> 00:02:26,544
- I don't, Julie and Beau
- I never

86
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:27,595
- Julie and Beau get them in their nose.

87
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,565
Bonnie just got some on her top lip.

88
00:02:29,565 --> 00:02:31,632
Think about it, we just got
back from crazy changes,

89
00:02:31,632 --> 00:02:33,249
crazy sleep changes

90
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:34,776
- [Jared] Yep going
right into the holidays.

91
00:02:34,776 --> 00:02:36,276
- There's just lots going on, winter,

92
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:37,109
I have a cold sore, dangit.

93
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,133
- Yeah, I've never had a
cold sore in my entire life.

94
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:39,966
- [Ellie] Come here.

95
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:40,799
(kissing)

96
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,186
- I kiss you all the
time and it doesn't work.

97
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:43,271
It's like a genetic thing.

98
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:45,638
- Well yeah it is, but my
mom didn't have cold sores

99
00:02:45,638 --> 00:02:47,237
and now she does

100
00:02:47,237 --> 00:02:48,495
because of my dad.
- Does she have them?

101
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:50,522
- I'm not kissing you anymore,

102
00:02:50,522 --> 00:02:52,209
at least not until that bad boy is gone.

103
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:53,806
Let's call it Little Jared.

104
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:54,697
- Ew.

105
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,707
- So we're working on a
big project this weekend.

106
00:02:57,707 --> 00:02:59,258
And I want to show you downstairs.

107
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:01,902
Everyone's just hanging
out here having lunch.

108
00:03:01,902 --> 00:03:02,735
I heard some music,

109
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,272
are you gonna play us
a song and serenade us?

110
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,853
- I already did it, I
like it, it's awesome.

111
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,423
- Okay, anyone else have
the musical talent ability?

112
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:12,681
But I thought it was funny,

113
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:14,598
they're huddled down
there with the fireplace.

114
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:16,655
They turned it on because it
was a little chilly down there,

115
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,390
eatin' lunch, that's fun.

116
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,223
Mmmm.

117
00:03:19,223 --> 00:03:20,814
(playful music)

118
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,897
Mmm, this guy's looking a little sad.

119
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,584
I got it Ellie.

120
00:03:26,584 --> 00:03:28,917
Ellie I got it, don't worry.

121
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:31,003
- [Jared] Why is this so funny?

122
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,253
- I don't know.

123
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:39,257
(laughing)

124
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:40,090
- [Ellie] Totally.

125
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,923
- You want me to do this one too?

126
00:03:40,923 --> 00:03:43,205
- [Ellie] Totally you do.

127
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:44,563
- [Jared] Much better.

128
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,427
(laughs)

129
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,322
Why is that the funniest thing?

130
00:03:48,322 --> 00:03:49,551
- Oh we were sitting here laughing,

131
00:03:49,551 --> 00:03:51,854
looking at that tree and I was like,

132
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:52,714
you should get some floss.

133
00:03:52,714 --> 00:03:56,155
- [Jared] Floss will do the trick.

134
00:03:56,155 --> 00:03:57,925
So it's like our trees out there,

135
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:58,862
they've got post holders,

136
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,365
so they grow upright and straight.

137
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:03,246
- I want to make a garage.

138
00:04:03,246 --> 00:04:04,079
- [Ellie] You want to make a garage,

139
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,605
want me to help you again?

140
00:04:05,605 --> 00:04:06,438
- Yeah.

141
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:11,069
- [Ellie] Okay, remember,
can you stack that into four?

142
00:04:11,069 --> 00:04:13,152
Push that so it connects?

143
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,325
Perfect.

144
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:20,075
And then you can build the sides.

145
00:04:21,517 --> 00:04:22,350
Perfect.

146
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:26,022
Yep, woop.

147
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:28,525
- I'm doing an audio
test with the microphone.

148
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:31,429
You can't see it, but it's right here.

149
00:04:31,429 --> 00:04:34,091
- [Ellie] We have a car
garage and what's this?

150
00:04:34,091 --> 00:04:35,144
- A car washer.

151
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:35,977
- [Ellie] A car washer.

152
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:38,250
Calvin, can you wash your car?

153
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,213
Oh, he wants to put his car
in the garage with yours.

154
00:04:42,213 --> 00:04:43,220
This is our car wash.

155
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,315
They get washed,

156
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:46,126
they get dried, they get buffed,

157
00:04:46,126 --> 00:04:49,290
and then they go into the car garage.

158
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,957
(playful music)

159
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:59,191
- Well I'm sitting in the car

160
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,024
and you're just sitting in the car,

161
00:05:00,024 --> 00:05:01,576
you feel like you're invincible,

162
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:03,097
like no one can hear or see you.

163
00:05:03,097 --> 00:05:03,930
- [Ellie] You can fart and burp

164
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,096
all you want.
- I let out a burp

165
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,931
- and I've got my mic on

166
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,186
and the sound guy over here,
he looks at me he's like,

167
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:12,967
I hear that, and I was like oh no!

168
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:13,800
(laughing)
- Did you?

169
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,967
- Wow.
- Yeah.

170
00:05:16,563 --> 00:05:18,058
- Did you hear that?

171
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:18,988
- [Jared] Yes I got it.

172
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:21,051
- Are we gonna put ornaments on the tree?

173
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,329
- [Ellie] Jared, that was hilarious.

174
00:05:23,329 --> 00:05:26,070
That was so funny, I was
so embarrassed, like.

175
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,094
You can't get me.

176
00:05:27,094 --> 00:05:27,927
I'm all the way up here,

177
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:29,722
you can't get me young man.

178
00:05:29,722 --> 00:05:31,831
Whoa, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey whoa hey

179
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,084
hey hey hey whoa whoa whoa oh,

180
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,605
Mommy what am I gonna do?

181
00:05:35,605 --> 00:05:37,232
Ahhh!

182
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:39,482
(laughing)

183
00:05:40,415 --> 00:05:42,748
Everyone, the floor is lava.

184
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,227
Hurry the floor is
lava, the floor is lava.

185
00:05:46,227 --> 00:05:48,689
- Did you guys have a good day today?

186
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,887
Say that's a wrap.
- Yeah.

187
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,137
- That's a wrap.

188
00:05:52,137 --> 00:05:56,653
- Yeah, yay, we actually had
a lot of fun with the kids.

189
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:58,677
They did so good.

190
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:01,094
- I am so proud of my babies.

191
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:03,765
My parents and Jared's parents

192
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:05,597
helped watch the kids
a little bit yesterday

193
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:07,765
and today, while Jared and I filmed,

194
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:11,036
and it's definitely put
me in the holiday spirit.

195
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,797
I'm very excited for Thanksgiving

196
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:17,213
and very excited for
our project to come out.

197
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:18,860
Half of it is all about giving,

198
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,797
half of it is a different project.

199
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,741
I'm very very excited

200
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:24,901
for you guys to see what's coming out.

201
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,165
- Well and it's fun because

202
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:29,057
like we were planning on
putting up the tree today,

203
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:32,563
and I love being in the
holiday spirit already.

204
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:34,330
Like I was driving in the car today,

205
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,776
and they had Christmas music playing,

206
00:06:35,776 --> 00:06:38,899
and I was just like, I
shouldn't be listening to this,

207
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,084
but I like it.

208
00:06:40,084 --> 00:06:40,917
You know?
- Yeah.

209
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,235
- It was nice and I feel like I want

210
00:06:43,235 --> 00:06:45,938
to be in that spirit more often,

211
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:47,018
you know?
- Yeah.

212
00:06:47,018 --> 00:06:48,382
- [Ellie] Totally.

213
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,215
Love you.

214
00:06:49,215 --> 00:06:50,434
- I love you.

215
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:51,678
I'm glad we're doing
the holidays together.

216
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:54,447
- And Jared posted today on his Instagram,

217
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:55,830
which I thought was so cute,

218
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,434
he was like Ellie is not only

219
00:06:57,434 --> 00:06:58,536
I don't even know where the kids went,

220
00:06:58,536 --> 00:07:00,613
oh they're playing with them.
- They've got babysitters.

221
00:07:00,613 --> 00:07:01,446
(laughing)

222
00:07:01,446 --> 00:07:03,305
- Two people,

223
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:04,841
you guys are cute.

224
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,846
Thanks.

225
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:07,722
- I'm learning how to walk tonight.

226
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,025
- Nice.
- Awesome.

227
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,595
- Jared had posted on Instagram

228
00:07:11,595 --> 00:07:13,000
and he was like, I'm just so grateful

229
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,326
that Ellie and I are not
only husband and wife,

230
00:07:16,326 --> 00:07:18,111
but like we're co-workers.

231
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,295
And somebody had responded and was like,

232
00:07:20,295 --> 00:07:21,769
that truly is a blessing,

233
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:24,377
my parents worked together for 20 years,

234
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,209
and your parents worked together.

235
00:07:26,209 --> 00:07:27,042
- Yep.

236
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:30,141
- And there's so many pros
and cons about everything

237
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:31,571
that anyone does,

238
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:35,164
and I just think that one of
the biggest pros of what we do

239
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:38,716
is that I do get to see your face all day.

240
00:07:38,716 --> 00:07:40,928
- 'Cause I got a pretty
good looking face, don't I?

241
00:07:40,928 --> 00:07:42,628
I mean, I get a little

242
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,195
bored of it.
- That's not what I meant.

243
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:45,769
- People are gonna click off.

244
00:07:45,769 --> 00:07:46,919
That's not what I meant.

245
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:47,752
- I know.

246
00:07:47,752 --> 00:07:49,226
- Look at my cold sore.

247
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:52,000
I meant I'm grateful that
I get to see my family.

248
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,833
- Absolutely.

249
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,216
- A lot, that's a huge pro,

250
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:55,965
that's the biggest pro.
- Yeah.

251
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:56,798
- Absolutely.

252
00:07:56,798 --> 00:07:57,631
I was making a joke.

253
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:59,855
- I know, I'm a little hangry

254
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,645
at the very of the, everyone shhh.

255
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:04,011
Let me, I gotta wrap up.
- I gotta do my line,

256
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:04,946
I'm hungry.
- gotta do my line.

257
00:08:04,946 --> 00:08:06,431
- Okay I'm gonna eat or I'll

258
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,025
- We're gonna eat Tandoori Oven,

259
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,718
which is delicious.
- Bite somebody.

260
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:10,551
- Okay.

261
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:11,818
- I'm angry and hungry.
- You can bite me.

262
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:13,502
(growling)

263
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:15,958
- Hi, what are you doing?

264
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:16,919
(Calvin exclaims)

265
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:17,857
You're filming?

266
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:18,719
- [Calvin] Yeah.

267
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,977
- You're crazy.

268
00:08:19,977 --> 00:08:22,644
(Calvin laughs)

269
00:08:24,566 --> 00:08:27,297
- [Jared] And suddenly, everyone is gone.

270
00:08:27,297 --> 00:08:28,880
We have an empty house.

271
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,796
(gentle guitar music)

272
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:31,036
Where is everyone?

273
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:32,844
Penny and I went to go run a quick errand

274
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:34,183
and there's a couple things that I learned

275
00:08:34,183 --> 00:08:35,548
when I was on that errand.

276
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,865
One, it is really cold outside.

277
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:40,138
I think it was down to 25 degrees

278
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:42,322
Fahrenheit outside tonight.

279
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:46,685
Two, this coat and this
dog do not mix very well.

280
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,505
Penny loves this.

281
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,715
I don't know why, but she
was in the car with me

282
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:54,943
and she jumped from the
backseat to the front

283
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:56,436
and was chewing this like crazy.

284
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,361
And I was like no no no, I'm oh.

285
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:01,279
So anyway, don't wear
this coat around Penny.

286
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,870
I'm still getting used
to having the tree up.

287
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,803
It was nice getting it set up

288
00:09:05,803 --> 00:09:07,730
and feel that feeling you get

289
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,795
when you put up a Christmas tree.

290
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,630
And like I said earlier,

291
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,072
I like having that holiday
spirit that's around, earlier.

292
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,422
It just brings the spirit
of giving on my mind

293
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:21,104
all the more, and that's why I'm excited

294
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:22,713
about these projects that
we've been working on,

295
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:25,545
is that it's all centered around giving

296
00:09:25,545 --> 00:09:28,121
and giving back, and I can't wait

297
00:09:28,121 --> 00:09:29,273
for you guys to see it.

298
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,772
And like I said, we'll let you know

299
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:32,057
exactly when things are happening,

300
00:09:32,057 --> 00:09:35,946
but I wanted to ask you specifically,

301
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:38,985
what puts you in the holiday spirit,

302
00:09:38,985 --> 00:09:41,382
the sprit of giving,
the spirit of gratitude?

303
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:43,299
What does that for you,

304
00:09:44,438 --> 00:09:46,974
and what do you like to
do to give back to others?

305
00:09:46,974 --> 00:09:50,199
That's something that Ellie
and I want to make a tradition,

306
00:09:50,199 --> 00:09:52,784
is every year we want to
do something to give back.

307
00:09:52,784 --> 00:09:54,669
And we've got a lot of
things planned this year

308
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,396
that I'm very excited about.

309
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,525
And it's gonna be a good holiday season

310
00:09:58,525 --> 00:09:59,685
and I can't wait for that.

311
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:03,332
And I can't wait for Penny
to play in the snow again.

312
00:10:03,332 --> 00:10:04,707
She is loving life right now.

313
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:05,915
She's such a good dog.

314
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,819
Hey, hey, you being a good girl?

315
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:11,186
But yeah I've got an empty
quiet house right now.

316
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:12,578
Well it's not empty, everyone's asleep

317
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,139
and all the crew is gone,

318
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:16,450
so I think I'm gonna call it a night.

319
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,798
Thank you guys for watching.

320
00:10:17,798 --> 00:10:19,552
I hope you have a wonderful day

321
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,079
and we will see you next time.

322
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,711
Penny, can you say bye bye?

323
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:23,559
Bye guys.

324
00:10:23,559 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye guys, oh no no no,
don't chew that, no no, bye.
