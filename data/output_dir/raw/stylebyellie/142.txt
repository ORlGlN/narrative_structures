1
00:00:00,354 --> 00:00:02,441
- Let us get close together

2
00:00:02,441 --> 00:00:05,524
for this video today.
- Should we just

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:07,942
- Who have you kissed?

4
00:00:07,942 --> 00:00:09,276
- Huh?

5
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,525
That is the discussion today.

6
00:00:10,525 --> 00:00:11,466
We are going to be talking about--

7
00:00:11,466 --> 00:00:12,407
- This is Jared's idea by the way.

8
00:00:12,407 --> 00:00:13,876
- Yeah, I think this is a great idea.

9
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:16,860
We're gonna be talking
about our first kisses.

10
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,283
Do you remember your first kiss?

11
00:00:18,283 --> 00:00:19,116
- Yes.

12
00:00:19,116 --> 00:00:20,651
- You do, okay good.

13
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:22,370
Because I'm kind of surprised about that,

14
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,753
because you've had so many first kisses.

15
00:00:25,753 --> 00:00:26,586
What?

16
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:28,188
Oh, sorry, is that too revealing,

17
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:29,916
is that too controversial at this time.

18
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:30,852
- Its okay.

19
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,982
Hey, as long as it's okay with you,

20
00:00:32,982 --> 00:00:33,815
it just happened.

21
00:00:33,815 --> 00:00:37,604
- You know I think you
are my last first kiss.

22
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,437
(bell dings)

23
00:00:38,437 --> 00:00:40,201
- Well I've very happy to say

24
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,275
that that's the same with you.

25
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,108
- Is is?

26
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:44,074
- Yes.

27
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:46,889
(laughing)

28
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,442
- So I thought it would be fun

29
00:00:48,442 --> 00:00:50,514
to talk about our very first kisses

30
00:00:50,514 --> 00:00:52,282
and the experience we had

31
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:54,354
and what it was like,

32
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,524
and if you liked it or you didn't like it,

33
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,446
or if there were any kisses that you had

34
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:02,029
that you just didn't
really like, so go ahead.

35
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:04,727
- I think for me, I
would rather just share

36
00:01:04,727 --> 00:01:07,006
the most awkward kiss I have ever had

37
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:08,334
in my entire life.

38
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:09,413
- I want to hear that story.
- I think that's the one

39
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:10,938
- that I would like to share.

40
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:11,771
- Okay.

41
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,088
- You start first this is your video.

42
00:01:13,088 --> 00:01:14,088
- Sure okay,

43
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,311
- Whatever you want to
share, lay it out there.

44
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:17,510
- I'm gonna lay it all out there.

45
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,702
So I was dating this girl,

46
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:21,258
which it's funny, because one,

47
00:01:21,258 --> 00:01:23,025
she's probably watching this video,

48
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:25,465
two, you guys are like
really good friends now,

49
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:28,266
so it's almost like weird for me,

50
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,665
but it's not, because I
honestly think she's awesome.

51
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:32,498
- She is,

52
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:33,531
- Like she's so so wonderful.

53
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,396
- Jared's old first real girlfriend

54
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:36,707
- My first real girlfriend, yeah.

55
00:01:36,707 --> 00:01:38,815
- is now really good friends with me.

56
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:40,025
(laughing)

57
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:41,121
And it's not weird

58
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:41,954
- No it's not.

59
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:43,402
- Your family really
likes her, I like her.

60
00:01:43,402 --> 00:01:44,626
I text her

61
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,459
- All the time.
- All the time,

62
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:46,724
- like we text all the time

63
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:48,607
and she's actually moving,

64
00:01:48,607 --> 00:01:49,798
and I cannot wait

65
00:01:49,798 --> 00:01:50,881
To hang out.
- She's moving to Utah.

66
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:51,714
- Yeah.

67
00:01:51,714 --> 00:01:52,547
- Yeah.

68
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,073
- Well no, we love her,
our family loves her,

69
00:01:54,073 --> 00:01:55,018
so it's kinda cool,

70
00:01:55,018 --> 00:01:55,851
- Yeah.

71
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:56,695
- it's kinda fun,

72
00:01:56,695 --> 00:01:58,863
but I'm gonna tell you
about our very first kiss.

73
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:01,094
- Okay, lay it out there,

74
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:01,927
how old were you?

75
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:02,830
- I'm trying to make sure

76
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,294
I'm not mixing up two stories.

77
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:07,575
But I might make up the two stories.

78
00:02:07,575 --> 00:02:09,222
Or I might miss the two stories.

79
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:10,205
I'm not gonna make 'em up,
(laughing)

80
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,902
this is good enough as it is.

81
00:02:11,902 --> 00:02:13,617
So I was 16 years old, okay?

82
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:14,450
- Okay.

83
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,883
- I was 16 when I had my very first kiss,

84
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:16,965
which is not to be ashamed of,

85
00:02:16,965 --> 00:02:18,947
that's totally fine.

86
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:22,697
I was with my buddy and
he was older than me.

87
00:02:23,922 --> 00:02:25,674
No maybe I was 15, because I didn't have

88
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,482
my driver's license, or maybe he was just

89
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:29,440
driving us around, because
I didn't have a car.

90
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,425
Both are very true.

91
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:33,537
So we, after a stake
dance, which is a dance

92
00:02:33,537 --> 00:02:35,044
where all of the kids
- a church dance

93
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:37,242
- in the church area get together

94
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:38,373
and it's like this big get together

95
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,729
hang out, it's a lot of fun.

96
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:42,137
After that, we hung out,

97
00:02:42,137 --> 00:02:44,548
and then my buddy was taking me

98
00:02:44,548 --> 00:02:47,477
and my girlfriend a the time home.

99
00:02:47,477 --> 00:02:50,756
There was me, my girlfriend at the time,

100
00:02:50,756 --> 00:02:53,036
my buddy, and I think
there was another girl

101
00:02:53,036 --> 00:02:54,024
in the car too.

102
00:02:54,024 --> 00:02:55,592
So we were driving home

103
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,645
and it was in my front yard,

104
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,357
like my driveway.

105
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:00,668
We got out of the car and obviously

106
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:03,045
we'd been dating for awhile now,

107
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:05,345
and like I was anticipating,
we were both anticipating

108
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:07,143
this very first kiss.

109
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,976
And my buddy cranked up the music,

110
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:11,835
his name's Matt.

111
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:14,311
He's so funny, like he's so funny.

112
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,504
He cranked up the music
and guess what he played?

113
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:17,576
- What?

114
00:03:17,576 --> 00:03:19,521
- Little Mermaid's Kiss the Girl.

115
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:20,501
- Awww, that was cute.

116
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,638
- And he rolls down the window,

117
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:25,072
he rolls the window down and he says,

118
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,378
♫ There you see her.

119
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:30,467
♫ Do do do do do do do

120
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,300
- I've never heard this.
- So it was funny,

121
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,133
- because we had all been talking

122
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:33,828
about this first kiss,

123
00:03:33,828 --> 00:03:35,855
and that it's just never happened yet,

124
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:38,909
and so we laughed and we
just looked at each other

125
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:40,339
and then we kissed.

126
00:03:40,339 --> 00:03:41,172
- Cute.

127
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:43,450
- And it was a very very sweet kiss.

128
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,283
- Oh that's cute.

129
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:46,414
- Yeah, it was really fun.
- I've never heard that story.

130
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:49,142
- No actually, all of that is true,

131
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,278
except it wasn't at my house,

132
00:03:51,278 --> 00:03:52,374
it was at her house.

133
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:53,732
It was at her house.
- Okay.

134
00:03:53,732 --> 00:03:55,459
- I mean it's so long ago,
it's hard to remember.

135
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,588
- Yeah, this is more than
10 years ago, holy crap.

136
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,993
The one at my house
was our first make out.

137
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:03,665
(gasps)

138
00:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,592
- On the couch?

139
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:06,528
- No no no, in our driveway.

140
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:09,579
Very similar experience
and I think my buddy Matt

141
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:11,311
and that same girl

142
00:04:11,311 --> 00:04:13,692
were in the car while that happened.

143
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:15,186
(laughing)

144
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:17,290
I think that's true, so anyway.

145
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,123
- Awww.

146
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:21,334
- We dated for two, three
years I think in high school.

147
00:04:21,334 --> 00:04:22,357
- Exclusively?

148
00:04:22,358 --> 00:04:23,191
- Mmm-hmm.

149
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:24,432
- So you didn't date other girls?

150
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:25,265
- Mmm-mmm.

151
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,447
- Did you go on single dates with her,

152
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:27,280
did it have to be a group date.

153
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,471
- No we were always in groups.

154
00:04:28,471 --> 00:04:29,521
Yeah, it was always in groups.

155
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,097
- I always had to be in groups.

156
00:04:31,097 --> 00:04:33,196
There were a few times
where it was single.

157
00:04:33,196 --> 00:04:34,803
I think I was the youngest and it wasn't

158
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:35,786
(laughing)

159
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:36,952
- Your parents were like, I don't care.

160
00:04:36,952 --> 00:04:38,227
- For the most part,

161
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,756
I was supposed to be in groups.

162
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,438
And we did a good job of doing that.

163
00:04:41,438 --> 00:04:45,128
I had the worst kissing experience ever.

164
00:04:45,128 --> 00:04:45,961
- Aww.

165
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:46,794
- It was--

166
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:47,949
- Please tell me it's not me.

167
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:48,782
- No.

168
00:04:48,782 --> 00:04:49,661
(laughing)

169
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:51,140
or else I would not have kids with you.

170
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,970
So I was working at the ice cream shop.

171
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,953
I met a few different boyfriends

172
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:56,122
at the ice cream shop.

173
00:04:56,122 --> 00:04:59,763
His sister actually asked if I was single

174
00:04:59,763 --> 00:05:01,368
and got my number for her brother.

175
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,378
- That's a good sister.

176
00:05:02,378 --> 00:05:03,215
- It was fun

177
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:04,911
and they were a really nice family

178
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:06,748
and I really liked them.

179
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:09,249
And actually, I liked her,

180
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:11,056
the other sister was not very nice to me

181
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,009
and I didn't feel very comfortable

182
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:13,920
and that made me feel bad.

183
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,633
So I'm grateful for nice sister-in-laws.

184
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,589
Because you don't ever want

185
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:18,455
to feel uncomfortable.

186
00:05:18,455 --> 00:05:19,288
- Right.

187
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:20,183
- So he asked me out,

188
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:22,687
and we went on a few dates.

189
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:24,277
And he was older than me,

190
00:05:24,277 --> 00:05:25,588
and I was younger,

191
00:05:25,588 --> 00:05:27,163
so I thought he obviously likes me

192
00:05:27,163 --> 00:05:29,727
or he wouldn't keep asking me out.

193
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,268
The first few dates
were really consistent.

194
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:35,323
And then I would always,
like he never texted,

195
00:05:35,323 --> 00:05:37,097
and it was weird because
that was kind of the thing,

196
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,687
like you always were texting.

197
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,789
He never texted.

198
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:41,692
I think one time I texted him and said,

199
00:05:41,692 --> 00:05:43,013
hey, thanks for the fun date

200
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:44,355
and I never heard anything back

201
00:05:44,355 --> 00:05:46,772
and I was like, okay well,

202
00:05:46,772 --> 00:05:48,579
I'll just not text him,

203
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,412
it was weird.
- Yeah.

204
00:05:49,412 --> 00:05:50,557
- But he called me at 10 at night

205
00:05:50,557 --> 00:05:51,822
and he's like, put your prom dress on

206
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:54,566
and we're gonna all go hang out.

207
00:05:54,566 --> 00:05:55,498
- What?

208
00:05:55,498 --> 00:05:56,356
- It was really weird

209
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,747
and even my mom, I remember her face,

210
00:05:58,747 --> 00:06:01,551
she was kinda wondering
if she should tell me

211
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,614
not to go.

212
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:04,415
I think she kinda didn't want me to go

213
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:06,000
but she let me.
- Yeah.

214
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,228
It was a group,

215
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:10,077
and so we ended up putting
our prom dresses on.

216
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,892
He's like out of high school, by the way.

217
00:06:12,892 --> 00:06:14,313
And we just made a fun date out of it.

218
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:15,530
It was fun, we had fun,

219
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,686
we drove around town,

220
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:17,846
I think we grabbed food,

221
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:19,330
went to their house and watched a movie.

222
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,132
But it was really weird like--

223
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:22,965
- And this is not prom night.

224
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,900
- No, and we were watching a movie

225
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,547
and I knew he wanted to kiss me

226
00:06:28,547 --> 00:06:31,188
and so we went to kiss,
but it was awkward.

227
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:34,457
I was just like, are you
even wanting to kiss,

228
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:36,009
like he's the one that kissed me,

229
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,676
but it was just like

230
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,335
- Like what I did at the beginning.

231
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:42,190
- It was so weird, yeah, just exactly

232
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,644
what he did at the beginning of the video.

233
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,306
It was so weird.

234
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,015
And then I was like, well okay,

235
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:48,875
and usually once you kiss someone,

236
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,488
every time you see them,

237
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:51,898
- You do a greeting kiss.
- on a date,

238
00:06:51,898 --> 00:06:53,474
- you'll kiss once,
- Yeah.

239
00:06:53,474 --> 00:06:54,307
- at least at the end of the night.

240
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:55,140
- Right.

241
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,973
- And so we went out on a few more dates

242
00:06:55,973 --> 00:06:58,039
and he didn't kiss me,

243
00:06:58,039 --> 00:06:59,223
and I was like, well that's weird.

244
00:06:59,223 --> 00:07:00,963
And then one night, he did kiss me.

245
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,363
I was like, oh my gosh, he kissed me.

246
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:05,126
And then again, not, and I was like

247
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,959
this is the weirdest guy.

248
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,335
- I think I know his strategy here.

249
00:07:08,335 --> 00:07:10,382
He's thinking I'm gonna kiss her

250
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,481
in the most awkward situations

251
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,290
in the most awkwardly way possible.

252
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,711
- And then the very last
time that we kissed,

253
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:18,738
he had brought me soup,

254
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:20,504
because I went home from work sick,

255
00:07:20,504 --> 00:07:23,545
which again, if he didn't like me,

256
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:24,378
- He wouldn't have done it.

257
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,211
- He wouldn't have done it.

258
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,425
And I though oh that's really nice.

259
00:07:27,425 --> 00:07:28,844
It's not like I was sick,

260
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:31,162
I just was like, I don't know,

261
00:07:31,162 --> 00:07:32,752
maybe that's why he
didn't want to kiss me,

262
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:33,585
because he thought I was sick.

263
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:34,658
- Well yeah, I don't think you probably

264
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:35,968
want to kiss when you're,

265
00:07:35,968 --> 00:07:36,857
well maybe you're just like

266
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:37,690
- You would've kissed me

267
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,890
no matter what.
- I totally would have.

268
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,526
- Because my thinking on that,

269
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:42,471
is like, I don't care,

270
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,452
I'm gonna kiss you because I love you.

271
00:07:44,452 --> 00:07:45,597
- And so I went to kiss him,

272
00:07:45,597 --> 00:07:47,852
and it was the weirdest thing.

273
00:07:47,852 --> 00:07:48,685
- Did he go like?

274
00:07:48,685 --> 00:07:50,972
- Oh he totally was like

275
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:54,404
and I was like, nevermind,
it was so awkward.

276
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:56,476
I was like, I think we're done.

277
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,867
And I think we went on
one other date after that.

278
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,460
And then he moved for college.

279
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,006
And I was like, that was weird.

280
00:08:02,006 --> 00:08:02,839
- Yeah.

281
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,672
- Isn't that funny?

282
00:08:03,672 --> 00:08:07,776
- Yeah, I've never really had
a bad experience with kissing.

283
00:08:07,776 --> 00:08:11,193
I've kissed like four girls before we met

284
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:15,007
and got married and everything

285
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:18,160
and none of them were like bad kisses,

286
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,465
I never had a really bad experience.

287
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:22,443
So I don't have anything that tops that.

288
00:08:22,443 --> 00:08:25,718
- I had one other that
was really weird too,

289
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:26,551
the last one.

290
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:27,970
- I think with how many
guys you've kissed,

291
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,317
you're bound to have
a couple bad (laughs).

292
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:31,578
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

293
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:33,357
- I think I only kissed him twice

294
00:08:33,357 --> 00:08:34,599
and we didn't kiss anymore.

295
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,775
But I just thought,

296
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:37,905
I don't think this is how you're supposed

297
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:38,787
to like make out.

298
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:39,620
- Yeah.

299
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:42,508
- I think he just went,
and shoved his tongue

300
00:08:42,508 --> 00:08:44,043
in my throat and I was like (gagging).

301
00:08:44,043 --> 00:08:44,876
- Yeah, that's weird.

302
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:45,709
- I literally went like that,

303
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,553
I went like (gagging),
like what are you doing?

304
00:08:47,553 --> 00:08:51,386
- Well and my thinking is,
it's not that difficult.

305
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,171
I don't know how people can
be like really bad kissers.

306
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:54,131
- Weird kissers.

307
00:08:54,131 --> 00:08:54,964
- Yeah.

308
00:08:54,964 --> 00:08:56,681
- Which I guess I should say that

309
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,014
with the caveat,

310
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:01,249
I only know that Ellie has told me

311
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,713
that I'm not a bad kisser.

312
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:04,279
I don't know what the other girls

313
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,700
have thought about me kissing, so.

314
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,242
- Jared's a good kisser
and he's really nice.

315
00:09:08,242 --> 00:09:10,595
You took forever to kiss me.

316
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,147
- I did, should we talk
about our first kiss?

317
00:09:12,147 --> 00:09:13,848
- I think we have before.

318
00:09:13,848 --> 00:09:14,755
- Let's talk about it now.
- Sure.

319
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,808
- I told Jared's friend
that I was a little

320
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:17,999
disappointed that he didn't kiss me,

321
00:09:17,999 --> 00:09:19,540
because Valentine's came and gone

322
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,524
and he didn't kiss me.

323
00:09:20,524 --> 00:09:21,816
- I did not kiss her on Valentine's Day.

324
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,188
- So it was the day after Valentine's

325
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:24,171
that Jared kissed me.

326
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:26,039
- Well it's not because I
didn't want to kiss you,

327
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,308
because of Valentine's Day.

328
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:28,796
Of course I wanted to kiss you.

329
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,073
The reason why it took me a long time

330
00:09:31,073 --> 00:09:33,847
to kiss you, is because I wanted

331
00:09:33,847 --> 00:09:35,617
to take things slow,
- See?

332
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,530
- I really did.

333
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:37,686
- I know.

334
00:09:37,686 --> 00:09:40,614
- Because a couple of my relationships

335
00:09:40,614 --> 00:09:42,126
progressed really fast

336
00:09:42,126 --> 00:09:43,854
and crashed and burned

337
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:45,757
and I did not want that
to happen with you.

338
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:48,506
And I said, I want this
to go really really well,

339
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:50,212
so I'm going to take my time

340
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:54,325
and not base things off
of physical feelings

341
00:09:54,325 --> 00:09:56,396
and do more outside of that.

342
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,229
- You're cute.

343
00:09:57,229 --> 00:10:01,060
- So kissing, while it's very very fun,

344
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,050
and kissing is not a contract.

345
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,973
That's a Flight of the
Conchords restaurant, reference.

346
00:10:04,973 --> 00:10:07,513
I wanted it to be more than
just physical attraction,

347
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:08,560
and kissing and everything,

348
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,887
so I waited and I got to know you

349
00:10:10,887 --> 00:10:12,000
and fell in love with you,

350
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,875
before I fell in love with your lips.

351
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:17,774
You know, that's profound.

352
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:19,199
- Yeah and then when he went to kiss me,

353
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,221
I turned my head.

354
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:23,071
- I remember that, I was like what the?

355
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:24,113
Maybe I did wait too long.

356
00:10:24,113 --> 00:10:26,781
- I think I was just a little nervous.

357
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:27,886
And I think it just happened,

358
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,568
I really did not purposely try to be

359
00:10:29,568 --> 00:10:33,337
a brat or, I think it just
happened, and I was like

360
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:34,841
- And it wasn't like
that was the end of it.

361
00:10:34,841 --> 00:10:38,579
You turned your cheek and
then you went in for it,

362
00:10:38,579 --> 00:10:40,314
just right after it.

363
00:10:40,314 --> 00:10:43,419
So at first, I was like (gasps), ahh.

364
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:45,884
(laughs)

365
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:49,171
So that leaves us with a question,

366
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:52,225
what are your first kiss experiences like?

367
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,257
Do you have some amazing ones?

368
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:55,245
Do you have some terrible ones?

369
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:58,138

experiences have been like
