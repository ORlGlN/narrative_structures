1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,970
- I had no idea posting
an Instagram picture

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:05,124
would cause so much controversy.

3
00:00:05,124 --> 00:00:06,609
- He was snoring pretty loud.

4
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:07,615
- She loves this color.

5
00:00:07,615 --> 00:00:08,727
I love you Mom.

6
00:00:08,727 --> 00:00:10,160
- Why does he sleep so much?

7
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,410
Would you hate it if we tried

8
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,640
to make veggie egg rolls too?

9
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,000
- [Jared] I wouldn't hate it.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,122
- Should we try or no?

11
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,178
- Let's just make it easy.

12
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,440
(laughs)

13
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,500
We've had a busy morning.

14
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,850
As soon as I got home from the gym,

15
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,940
we uploaded Ellie and
Bonnie's make-up video

16
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,870
on Ellie's channel.

17
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,420
I got another video edited

18
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,300
and then we filmed a video,

19
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,380
another Ellie and Bonnie video

20
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,910
that's gonna go up on Ellie's channel.

21
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,780
When is it Tuesday?

22
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,940
- [Ellie] It's every other.

23
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,120
- Every other, so something like that.

24
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,620
We'll let you know when it's posted, but--

25
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,030
Oh you found my controllers?

26
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:39,810
Thanks bud, I appreciate that.

27
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,255
Hey, while you're here, stick around.

28
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:43,270
Show me what's going on over here.

29
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,296
What'd you do?

30
00:00:44,296 --> 00:00:45,129
- Straw.

31
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,053
- [Jared] A straw.

32
00:00:46,053 --> 00:00:46,960
- This one.

33
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,850
- Yeah, what's in the straw?
- Wow.

34
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,371
- [Jared] Is there dirt in the straw?

35
00:00:51,371 --> 00:00:53,160
- Oh and you have my tape.

36
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:56,467
Can I have that?
- Yeah.

37
00:00:56,467 --> 00:00:57,947
- Don't go get my tape.

38
00:00:57,947 --> 00:00:58,780
(Jared laughs)

39
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,560
- Calvin is getting in the straws,

40
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,630
the tape and the Nintendo Switch.

41
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,730
And you've got dirt in your
hair, too, right there.

42
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,563
Is that for you to drink?

43
00:01:05,563 --> 00:01:07,848
Yeah, where did you get all those straws?

44
00:01:07,848 --> 00:01:09,528
- I have to do these away.

45
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:11,004
- [Jared] Are you gonna put 'em away?

46
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:11,837
- Mmm-hmm.

47
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:12,670
- [Jared] Oh thank you buddy,

48
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,066
I appreciate your help cleaning up.

49
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:14,899
- Mmm-hmm.

50
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:17,326
(flushing)

51
00:01:17,326 --> 00:01:18,515
- What did you do?

52
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:19,528
- Big poop.

53
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:20,824
- You did a big poop.

54
00:01:20,824 --> 00:01:21,657
- Mmm-hmm.

55
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,200
- Good job, high five.

56
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,849
Where's your potty watch?

57
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,440
- I threw it away.

58
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,696
- You threw it away?

59
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:29,154
(Ellie laughs)

60
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:30,400
Don't throw it away.

61
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,140
Not again Calvin, not again.

62
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,830
Why does he sleep so much?

63
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,420
- Because he's tired.

64
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,780
- [Ellie] Do you want to put it in?

65
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,810
Me, you hold it, perfect.

66
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,645
(gentle music)

67
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,020
I had no idea posting an Instagram picture

68
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,160
would cause so much controversy.

69
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,250
Okay I posted a picture about--

70
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,500
It really wasn't controversy.

71
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,850
I posted a picture about s'mores
and how I really don't like

72
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,490
to use regular Hershey
chocolate with my s'mores,

73
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,200
I like to use Reese's Peanut
Butter Cups or Mr. Goodbars.

74
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,150
And so many of you gave
awesome suggestions,

75
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,360
you're like we like to
use Ghirardelli Chocolate,

76
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,040
we like to use strawberries,

77
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,700
you like to use strawberry
marshmallows with chocolate

78
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,090
and I'm like, you guys
gave the best suggestions

79
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,330
and then some people
think it's a little weird.

80
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,770
I picked up the marshmallows,

81
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,440
we have graham crackers, picked up those.

82
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,900
And then I also picked up
some good chocolate for Mama.

83
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,220
And when we do marshmallows next time,

84
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,260
I don't know if we're gonna do it tonight

85
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,780
or sometime, but soon,

86
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,830
we're gonna have even better s'mores

87
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,522
than we usually do.

88
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:40,105
(bright music)

89
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,560
All of this talk about college

90
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,230
and what we used to eat at college

91
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,860
has made Jared and I
have a very big appetite

92
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,350
for tuna fish sandwich.

93
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,760
So that is exactly what Jared is making.

94
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,660
So good, cut up pickles, yummy.

95
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,820
- It takes me back.

96
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,750
- [Ellie] Memories.

97
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,470
- Oh my gosh yes.

98
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,410
Penny come!

99
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,243
Come here.

100
00:03:03,243 --> 00:03:04,280
She's so distracted.

101
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,822
Good girl.

102
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:08,170
- Dad, there's a little bit of snow left.

103
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:10,170
- [Jared] There's just
a little bit of snow.

104
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,920
This is where we went sledding, huh?

105
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,576
- Yeah, I want to go see it.

106
00:03:14,576 --> 00:03:16,159
- [Jared] Okay, go see it.

107
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,742
(gentle music)

108
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,090
Do you see it?

109
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,390
Do you want to sled on it?

110
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:25,790
- No, we don't have a sled.

111
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,623
- You're right.

112
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,259
Up up up up up up,

113
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,030
no you can't skip one.

114
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:32,863
There you go, have that.

115
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:33,696
- [Ellie] Woo hoo.

116
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,610
Last year at this time of year

117
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:38,560
it was snowing a ton and it was freezing.

118
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,780
Very grateful for this warm weather

119
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,930
that we get to play in.

120
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,050
You're going the opp--

121
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:49,200
(gentle music)

122
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,422
Did you guys decide to do a train?

123
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,255
- Yeah.

124
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:54,352
- [Ellie] Okay, make sure to choo choo.

125
00:03:54,352 --> 00:03:55,352
- Choo choo.

126
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:57,770
- You ready?

127
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,850
- Yes.

128
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:59,969
- Put your arms in the air Jackson.

129
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:02,719
Put your arms in the air.
- Yeah.

130
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:07,440
(Jared laughing)

131
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,500
- [Ellie] That was the shortest slide

132
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,320
that took the longest to--

133
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,600
- The set up took a long time,

134
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,562
but the execution was worth it.

135
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:14,850
- I want to lay down.

136
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,683
- [Jared] Why?

137
00:04:15,683 --> 00:04:17,459
- Because the sunshine is gonna hit me.

138
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,429
- [Jared] Oh okay.

139
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,550
You just close your eyes.

140
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,216
- [Ellie] Are you gonna fall asleep?

141
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:22,048
- Yes.

142
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:23,135
- [Ellie] Okay goodnight.

143
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,523
(Ellie snores)

144
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:25,700
- Bye park.

145
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,039
- I'll miss you.

146
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:27,956
- Miss you.

147
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:30,192
- I'll see you later.

148
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:31,490
- See later.

149
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,680
- Say I love Mom.

150
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,810
- I love Mom.

151
00:04:34,803 --> 00:04:36,275
- Say she's pretty cute.

152
00:04:36,275 --> 00:04:37,943
- You're cute Mom.

153
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:39,359
- She's my favorite.

154
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,150
- She's my fave.

155
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,550
- But Dad's pretty cool too.

156
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:44,376
- Me too.

157
00:04:44,376 --> 00:04:45,400
(laughing)

158
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,420
- [Jared] What are you looking for?

159
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,136
What did you call it?

160
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,097
- The rescuer.

161
00:04:49,097 --> 00:04:50,574
- [Jared] Why do you need the rescuer?

162
00:04:50,574 --> 00:04:54,500
- Because a marble's
trapped under the couch.

163
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,560
- [Jared] Okay well let's see

164
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,250
what you're gonna do with this.

165
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,203
Nice, did you get it?

166
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:02,053
- Yep.

167
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:03,708
- [Jared] Could you
reach the marble before?

168
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:04,541
- Yep.

169
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,440
- [Jared] With the rescuer you could?

170
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,320
That's pretty cool,

171
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,580
that's a pretty ingenious idea.

172
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,480
Good job, bud.

173
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,100
- Maybe there's some more things

174
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,080
under the couches.

175
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,785
- [Jared] Okay take a look and
see if you can grab anything.

176
00:05:15,785 --> 00:05:16,723
(bouncing marble)

177
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,270
Uh-oh, before it gets under again.

178
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,404
Good job.

179
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:20,654
- I see a rock,

180
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:24,686
my rock that I got for Christmas.

181
00:05:24,686 --> 00:05:25,519
I got it!

182
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,352
- [Jared] You got your rock?

183
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:27,185
- Yeah!

184
00:05:27,185 --> 00:05:28,121
- [Jared] Good.

185
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:28,954
- There's more.

186
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:29,787
- [Jared] Is there more?

187
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,620
Okay.

188
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,275
- Hey guys, tomorrows Valentine's Day.

189
00:05:33,275 --> 00:05:35,140
Let's get stuff for Mom!

190
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,778
I think Mom would like flowers.

191
00:05:37,778 --> 00:05:40,234
Should we get Mom flowers?

192
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:41,067
- Yeah.

193
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:41,900
(bright jazzy music)

194
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,741
- Flower!

195
00:05:42,741 --> 00:05:43,574
She loves this color.

196
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:44,685
- [Jared] She does?

197
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:45,620
- Yeah.

198
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,453
- [Jared] Do you think
we should get those ones?

199
00:05:46,453 --> 00:05:47,286
- Yeah.

200
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,119
- [Jared] Do they smell good?

201
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:48,952
- Yeah.

202
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:49,785
- [Jared] Okay.

203
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:50,618
- And purple ones.

204
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:51,469
- [Jared] And purple ones?

205
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,302
- [Jackson] Yeah.

206
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:53,522
- [Jared] Calvin, do you want to pick one?

207
00:05:53,522 --> 00:05:54,355
- Mmm-hmm.

208
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,188
- [Jared] Okay which ones?

209
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,021
- Red.

210
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,510
- [Jared] Red, these ones?

211
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,260
Alright, careful they're a little pokey.

212
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,093
Good job.

213
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:06,550
Calvin we picked out good floewrs, huh?

214
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,616
- Mmm-hmm.

215
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:10,016
- Mom will be so excited.

216
00:06:10,016 --> 00:06:11,849
Happy Valentine's Day.

217
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:14,213
I love you Mom.

218
00:06:14,213 --> 00:06:15,630
- I love you.

219
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,600
- [Ellie] Happy Valentine's Day.

220
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,680
- Happy Valentine's to you and me.

221
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,602
Ellie just farted right
before I said that.

222
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:23,650
I'm sorry (laughs).

223
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,940
That's, hey, you're flawless,

224
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,404
oh my goodness gracious.

225
00:06:27,404 --> 00:06:29,790
- I'm pregnant and I don't care.

226
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:30,770
Even if I'm not pregnant.

227
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,660
Okay, let's go.
- I don't even care.

228
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,150
- I wanted to say this,

229
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,620
one of my favorite things
about being married

230
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,410
or having a girlfriend
or anything like that,

231
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,930
having a significant
other, is doing a surprise.

232
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,330
And tomorrow, you have--

233
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,940
nothing crazy big, but
tomorrow's Valentine's Day

234
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,350
and I have a little surprise for you,

235
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,797
so I'm excited to give it to you.

236
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,272
- Even though we already got our gift.

237
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:52,970
- Mmm-hmm, yes we did.

238
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:53,830
- We'll tell you tomorrow.

239
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,663
- Yeah.

240
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,900
Now we're gonna go into my office

241
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,770
and we're gonna sit down

242
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:58,220
and we're gonna work a little bit more.

243
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,460
Just a little bit Ellie.

244
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,491
Hey, just a little bit.

245
00:07:00,491 --> 00:07:02,110
- Listen really carefully.

246
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,331
- Downstairs.

247
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:04,692
- They are playing with their marble run.

248
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,790
- They are playing with their marble run

249
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,270
and as long as they're in bed,

250
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,940
I don't care.

251
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,773
I don't care, it's bedtime,

252
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:10,606
they're playing in their bed.

253
00:07:10,606 --> 00:07:11,504
Oh my gosh.

254
00:07:11,504 --> 00:07:13,581
- Listen, wait, I want to hear.

255
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:16,414
(boys vocalizing)

256
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,176
- Literally seconds ago, they were playing

257
00:07:21,176 --> 00:07:22,009
in their bedroom.

258
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:22,842
- [Ellie] Yeah, we didn't say anything.

259
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,150
- We didn't say anything.

260
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,330
And now they're in their bed,
laying down to go to sleep,

261
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,287
oh my gosh that's the ultimate dream.

262
00:07:30,287 --> 00:07:34,300
Yeah, play in your room
before bed a little bit,

263
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,180
just as long as you're not in our way.

264
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,030
(laughs)

265
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,900
That's kind of a joke, but them laying--

266
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,917
- [Ellie] Well it's kinda true.

267
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:42,592
When we say it's bedtime,
- Yeah, it's bedtime.

268
00:07:42,592 --> 00:07:43,425
- it's bedtime.

269
00:07:43,425 --> 00:07:44,258
- [Jared] Yeah.

270
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,790
- We read stories, said prayer, you know?

271
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,553
- Yeah and now it's
like okay it's bedtime.

272
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:48,460
- [Ellie] That's sweet.

273
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,280
- They're in their bed,
they made that choice.

274
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,470
That's so sweet.

275
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,303
Are you watching them?

276
00:07:52,303 --> 00:07:54,770
- [Ellie] I'm trying, but I
don't know how to work this.

277
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,997
- It's cute, our little kids
are doing some great stuff.

278
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,000
- [Ellie] How do you push play?

279
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,070
- Oh my gosh, this is something else.

280
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,570
I'm coming downstairs, be quiet.

281
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,680
Hey, you stop talking,
you gotta listen okay,

282
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,496
it's time to be quiet.

283
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,960
Oh Ellie already went down
here and shut the door.

284
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,070
I'll see if I can peek in.

285
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:11,585
Oh I'm an idiot for doing
this, why am I doing this?

286
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,252
I shouldn't do this.

287
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,002
They're so stinking cute.

288
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:20,835
(Jackson snoring)

289
00:08:27,538 --> 00:08:29,490
Holy crap, did you hear that?

290
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:31,707
Ellie, you will not believe this.

291
00:08:31,707 --> 00:08:32,539
- [Ellie] What?

292
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,091
- Jackson snores just as loud as you do.

293
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,357
- I don't snore.

294
00:08:37,357 --> 00:08:38,616
(laughing)

295
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,489
Are you being serious?

296
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,520
- He was snoring pretty loud.

297
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,352
- Do I snore?

298
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,889
- [Jared] He was snoring really loud.

299
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,060
- He's so tired.

300
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:45,893
- [Jared] I know.

301
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:48,550
- He crawled up in bed and was like,

302
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,383
he was done.

303
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:50,216
- [Jared] Yeah.

304
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,049
- Do I snore?

305
00:08:51,049 --> 00:08:52,230
No it was just a joke,

306
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,913
just a little comedy for the vlog,

307
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:54,790
- [Ellie] No, I'm curious.

308
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,623
- Just a little joke here and there

309
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:57,520
to make you smile.

310
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,860
- I'm curious because at
night if Jared snores,

311
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm not nice, I just kick him.

312
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,993
- [Jared] Yeah.

313
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:04,850
- And I'm like shhh, and then he stops.

314
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,683
- Shhh and then I stop

315
00:09:05,683 --> 00:09:07,310
and I fall back asleep and--

316
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,830
I don't snore that much do I?

317
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,540
Ellie will engage in fisticuffs with me.

318
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,315
- [Ellie] One or the
other, it was really funny.

319
00:09:12,315 --> 00:09:14,520
- So oh my gosh, the kids are in bed

320
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,470
and you know what, I'm ready for bed.

321
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,480
I am zonked.

322
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,730
I've been waking up at five
in the morning every day.

323
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,666
- I'm a little sad, because I
want to watch a show with you.

324
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:22,499
But that's okay.
- You know what?

325
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:24,230
- Let's watch a show until I zonk.

326
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,210
I'll stay up for the next five minutes

327
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,220
while you watch your show

328
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,300
and you watch without me

329
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,187
and just pretend I'm awake.

330
00:09:29,187 --> 00:09:31,180
- I turned this off last
night, because it was lame,

331
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,013
but I'm gonna finish it.

332
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,620
- Congratulations Shaun White
for winning the gold medal,

333
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,508
America's 100th gold medal
- Woo hoo!

334
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,486
- Shaun White just earned,
his third snowboarding.

335
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,511
We've got two female snowboarders,

336
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,459
