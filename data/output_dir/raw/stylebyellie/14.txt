1
00:00:00,375 --> 00:00:03,042
(pensive music)

2
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,540
- Good morning.

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,032
While everybody has a
lame simple breakfast

4
00:00:27,032 --> 00:00:30,140
due to their simple request.

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,450
- Or simple taste buds.

6
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,482
- I have the ultimate one.

7
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:36,950
I packed veggies and tomatoes and cilantro

8
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,574
just so I could have my very own

9
00:00:38,574 --> 00:00:41,030
yummy breakfast burrito.

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,230
- [Jared] You wanna know how to fold it?

11
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,560
Well you take about half
that out. (chuckles)

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,720
- [Ellie] I want a big one.

13
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,815
- [Jared] Yeah, just
like that, that's good.

14
00:00:46,815 --> 00:00:48,370
- [Jackson] Mom, that's not yours.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,740
- [Jared] That sure is, unless you

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,774
want to take a bite of it.

17
00:00:50,774 --> 00:00:52,720
(laughs)

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,150
So Mom, be honest.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,300
How was last night, how did you sleep?

20
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,020
- I think the first night's
always a little crazy,

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,400
like, getting adjusted to
noises, the weather, whatever.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,000
It was good, it was better
than we've had before.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,920
No one threw up or pooped, so we're great.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,521
- We're always off to a better start

25
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
than our first couple trips.

26
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,760
- We've had a first few
rough trips in this,

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,732
but I think we're good.

28
00:01:12,732 --> 00:01:13,662
- [Jared] Yeah, I think we're good.

29
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:14,495
- Look at that!

30
00:01:14,495 --> 00:01:15,410
- There you go, nice fold.

31
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,175
So, I think one of the
hardest parts about this

32
00:01:17,175 --> 00:01:21,060
is getting the climate set up.

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,700
We are in Las Vegas, and it's warm here.

34
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,210
But at the night, it gets a little cool,

35
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,520
not like Utah cold, but our
heater needs to turn on,

36
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,300
and the closer you are to the
window, the colder it gets.

37
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,390
So the person on this
side of the bed gets hot,

38
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,800
that side of the bed gets cold.

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,840
So getting that flow going is one thing,

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,210
but I also looked, like I
already mentioned yesterday,

41
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,650
on the Facebook group, there's
a Facebook group that I'm on,

42
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,820
they have like these little covers

43
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,360
that you put over the
top of these canopies

44
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,650
that will keep the heat
in, and the cool air out.

45
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,840
So I think that's something that

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,907
we should probably invest in.

47
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:53,844
- Bingo.

48
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:55,520
- [Jared] All right.

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,800
- We're ready to go.

50
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,650
- [Jared] Let's get a family picture.

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,390
There's some amazing places here in Vegas,

52
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,470
and we're gonna take the kids to a park,

53
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,759
and Penny to a park where they can

54
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,090
ride their bikes and play.

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,810
I think it's like Red Rock or Red Stone

56
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,760
or something like that.

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,468
Hey, will you help me
get your bike in the car?

58
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:17,807
- Um, no.

59
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:19,160
- [Jared] Oh, are you
gonna help me lift it?

60
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,993
- Nope.

61
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:21,634
- [Jared] Do you want me to lift it?

62
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,240
Oh you're just gonna keep riding.

63
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,740
Oh, I see how it is.

64
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,650
I see how it is.

65
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,318
Jackson is just such a
master at his bicycle.

66
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:31,794
Like, he has exceeded my expectations.

67
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:33,600
And he's got a flat tire on the back.

68
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,566
He is just ripping and
railing through those trails

69
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:38,920
that he has pulled up a flat,
so we are gonna use this,

70
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,380
and we're gonna fill up his bike with air

71
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,780
so he can ride it throughout this trip.

72
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,890
- [Ellie] It is stunning out here.

73
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,777
The red rock, brown rock, it's so pretty!

74
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:53,740
- [Jared] Look at this over
here, isn't that incredible?

75
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,140
So we made it to the Calico Tanks trail,

76
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,980
and they are not wasting any time.

77
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,930
You guys are crazy!

78
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,381
There's no way Penny and I could do this.

79
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:02,540
- [Jackson] Hi!

80
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,458
- [Jared] How are you guys?

81
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,291
- [Jackson] Good.

82
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,210
- [Jared] Good, you're crazy,
you're all the way up there!

83
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,899
- [Ellie] He's like, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

84
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:09,290
- [Jared] (laughs) I'm
just looking up there,

85
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,801
and I'm like holy crap, my
wife is six months pregnant,

86
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:13,594
she's holding a baby, and she's hiking up

87
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:15,110
this rock willy nilly.

88
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,078
- I am having anxiety.

89
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,221
Jackson.

90
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,920
- [Jared] (laughs) With a little anxiety.

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,605
- And this is exactly
why we stay on the trail.

92
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:26,630
There are cactuses, snakes...

93
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,660
I think they even said scorpions.

94
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,493
- [Jared] Ooh.

95
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:30,710
- [Ellie] So we have to stay on the trail.

96
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,010
- [Jared] Yeah, so
let's stay on the trail,

97
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,890
and we'll have a lot of fun.

98
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,200
Look at how pokey those look.

99
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,278
Those look so pokey.

100
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:38,990
- Even they're for sharp things.

101
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,930
- [Jared] Yes, they are.

102
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,790
- [Jackson] Look at this tunnel.

103
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,910
- [Jared] Is that so cool?

104
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,205
- [Jackson] Oh, there's a rock right here.

105
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:45,424
- [Jared] Oh, fun!

106
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,049
- [Ellie] (laughs) There's
a rock right there, guys!

107
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:49,083
Right there! (chuckles)

108
00:03:49,083 --> 00:03:50,710
- [Jared] There's not many of them here.

109
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,780
- [Ellie] Miss Penn.

110
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,613
- [Jared] She has been a rockstar.

111
00:03:52,613 --> 00:03:54,590
- [Ellie] You, I was very nervous

112
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,100
the moment you got out of the car,

113
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,290
it was a little, woo!

114
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,311
What are we doing?!

115
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,257
- [Jared] She's like,
"You guys brought me to

116
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:01,507
"a national park!

117
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,970
"Let's go have fun, let's go crazy!"

118
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,622
- [Ellie] She was a little intense.

119
00:04:04,622 --> 00:04:07,043
But she's doing awesome, good girl.

120
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:09,751
- Wait me!

121
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,743
- [Ellie] Oh you want me to hold you?

122
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:15,576
- Uh-huh.

123
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,440
- Parenting fail.

124
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,113
I brought the Ergo, I may
have asked Jared to pack it.

125
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:24,340
It's in the RV.

126
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,430
- [Jared] I left it in the trailer.

127
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,654
My fault.
- Dang it!

128
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:27,970
- [Jackson] Look up here!

129
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,071
- [Jared] Whoa!

130
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:30,887
- [Ellie] This is so you!

131
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:32,790
- [Jackson] How do I get on here?

132
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,323
- [Jared] Jackson, look!

133
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:37,577
- [Ellie] Dad did it, Penny's doing it!

134
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,110
(laughs) Good girl!

135
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,696
- [Jackson] Wait, wait.

136
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:42,279
Dad, this for dogs.

137
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:45,137
- [Jared] Yeah, I guess we can keep Penny.

138
00:04:45,137 --> 00:04:46,610
- [Ellie] 'Kay, we'll keep her.

139
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,087
Let's let these guys go first.

140
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:51,038
- [Jackson] How did you get up there, Mom?

141
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,060
- [Ellie] I climbed so fast.

142
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,657
- [Jared] Go stand by Jackson.

143
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:56,019
- [Jackson] Do you think I'm cute in here?

144
00:04:56,019 --> 00:04:58,470
- [Jared] (laughs) Do you
think I'm cute in here.

145
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,320
Of course.

146
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,810
Oh wow, look at this, this is so cool.

147
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,036
- [Ellie] I love you!

148
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,046
- [Jackson] I love you.

149
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:05,416
- [Calvin] I love me.

150
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,270
- [Jared] I love me. (laughs)

151
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,633
- [Ellie] I love me, too.

152
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:12,216
(upbeat music)

153
00:05:26,208 --> 00:05:27,233
Come on, girl.

154
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:28,066
Good girl!

155
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,132
- [Jared] All right,
are we doing good, guys?

156
00:05:34,132 --> 00:05:34,965
- [Jackson] Yep!

157
00:05:34,965 --> 00:05:36,207
- [Jared] Are we taking a little pit stop?

158
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:37,782
- [Ellie] I think we made it halfway,

159
00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:40,650
and I think this is as far as we'll go.

160
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:42,622
- [Jared] Yeah, but I
just have to show you.

161
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,809
Look at the beautiful valley
we're sitting in, having lunch.

162
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:47,580
Isn't this incredible?

163
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,413
It's beautiful.

164
00:05:48,413 --> 00:05:49,680
- [Ellie] It is wonderful.

165
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,790
- [Jared] Yeah, its awesome.

166
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,240
- [Ellie] I feel like we could go further,

167
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,073
like with the rocks, but I don't know.

168
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,720
This is good, halfway's good.

169
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,813
- [Jared] Yeah, some--

170
00:05:57,813 --> 00:05:59,080
- [Ellie] Penny's a
trip, I wanna be grateful

171
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,913
for everything.

172
00:05:59,913 --> 00:06:01,730
- [Jared] Yeah, Penny has been
doing really, really great.

173
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,087
Someone's like, "Oh,
you're taking your dog

174
00:06:03,087 --> 00:06:03,920
"all the way up there?"

175
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,570
I was like, "Well, we've
never been here before."

176
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,126
They're like, "Yeah, you may not want to."

177
00:06:08,126 --> 00:06:10,320
(chuckles) So we're like, oh, okay.

178
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,970
So we're taking our pit stop now.

179
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,793
Oh, are those sandwiches good?

180
00:06:14,793 --> 00:06:16,452
Penny might think so, too. (laughs)

181
00:06:16,452 --> 00:06:17,620
- [Ellie] Yeah, she ate yours yesterday.

182
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,720
- [Jared] Yes, she did.

183
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
- I've been a good girl.

184
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,240
I did the hike.

185
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,620
I didn't complain.

186
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,146
I put on my sunscreen.

187
00:06:24,146 --> 00:06:26,050
But the one thing I want.

188
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,774
Cookies and cream ice cream.

189
00:06:27,774 --> 00:06:29,770
That just makes me, it looks like

190
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:31,235
cookies and cream up there.

191
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,387
You don't see it?

192
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:33,350
- [Jared] I don't see it.

193
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,183
- [Ellie] Oh, boo.

194
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,204
- You know what?

195
00:06:35,204 --> 00:06:36,037
I'll take cookies and cream any day.

196
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:37,890
- [Ellie] It looks like
cookies and cream up there.

197
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,970
Kids are, you know, punching sand.

198
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,728
- It's like that soft sand that just feels

199
00:06:41,728 --> 00:06:42,561
so good in your hand.

200
00:06:42,561 --> 00:06:43,480
- [Ellie] We're just gonna sit here

201
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,170
and see how long they're entertained for.

202
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,573
Penn, so happy you're so good.

203
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:56,303
- [Jackson] Doo dah doo
dah dah dah dah dah!

204
00:06:56,303 --> 00:06:57,370
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

205
00:07:02,323 --> 00:07:04,811
That was the police
helicopter, did you see that?

206
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:05,644
- Yeah.

207
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:06,742
- Do you think it was
getting someone else?

208
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,734
- [Jared] I do, I think
it was picking up someone.

209
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,943
- We saw it land and grab someone.

210
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,653
- Yeah, must've grabbed
someone or something like that.

211
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:14,789
It's either that or
someone's on the loose.

212
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:17,169
And they took this trail that we're on.

213
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:18,790
(chuckles) On the trails with criminals.

214
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,100
Hey Calvin, do you want me to hold you?

215
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,933
- No.

216
00:07:20,933 --> 00:07:22,334
- [Jared] No, where are you?

217
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:24,149
Who do you want to hold you?

218
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:25,480
- Um, Mom.

219
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,132
- [Jared] Mom? Are you sure?

220
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:28,793
Do you want Jackson?

221
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,907
Hey. (chuckles)

222
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:33,550
Free spankings.

223
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,671
- You deserve a butt spanking.

224
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,000
- [Jared] (laughs) It's not
even your birthday, Calvin,

225
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,440
and you get free spankings.

226
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,734
How wonderful is that?

227
00:07:39,734 --> 00:07:41,153
(laughing)

228
00:07:41,153 --> 00:07:45,903
Blup, blup, blup, blup,
blup, blup, blup, blup.

229
00:07:45,903 --> 00:07:47,740
(kids laughing)

230
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,097
- [Ellie] Hey, was that a fun horse ride?

231
00:07:49,097 --> 00:07:49,930
- [Jackson] Yeah.

232
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:50,763
- [Jared] That was fun.

233
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:51,680
- [Ellie] I saw horse rides over there,

234
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,250
but this was more, this was cheaper, so.

235
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:57,600
- Yeah, horseback riding
or Jared-back riding.

236
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,874
The choice is yours.

237
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:02,340
For the low price of $19.99.

238
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,173
Here we go.

239
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,779
- [Jackson] Wait for me, Daddaroo!

240
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,090
- [Ellie] I like walking
Penny when she's tired.

241
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,690
Ha! It's my favorite way to walk her.

242
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,330
- [Jared] As much as I'm sure you want to,

243
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,640
you're not allowed to drive.

244
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,215
You don't have a license!

245
00:08:18,215 --> 00:08:20,806
You didn't study for the test and pass it!

246
00:08:20,806 --> 00:08:22,450
You can't sit in this seat.

247
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,000
- She is so tired.

248
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,987
- [Jared] She had so much fun, didn't ya?

249
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:28,017
Oh, remember when you were just a puppy

250
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:30,239
and you could sleep with me while I drove?

251
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:32,118
Huh? Do you remember that?

252
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:33,620
- [Jackson] We're going to the pool.

253
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,977
- [Jared] You excited, boys?

254
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:35,900
- [Jackson] Yep!

255
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,750
- [Jared] Yep! Enough
hiking, let's start swimming!

256
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,582
- [Jackson] Yeah!

257
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:40,685
- [Jared] Yeah!

258
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,620
- Blow?

259
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,580
- [Jared] What'd you find?

260
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,650
- Um, this.

261
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,875
- [Jared] Yeah? Are you gonna blow it?

262
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:47,557
- Yeah. (blowing)

263
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,330
- [Jared] (chuckles) Good job.

264
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,173
Weeds everywhere!

265
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:55,877
(cheerful music)

266
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:05,610
- [Ellie] Calvin, was it too cold?

267
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,317
Was it cold?

268
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:10,067
(cheerful music)

269
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:19,360
- [Ellie] Crab walk again.

270
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,580
This is how you walk when
you're freezing cold.

271
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,609
This pool is beautiful and amazing,

272
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:26,049
but we are going to
take one teeny, tiny dip

273
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:27,940
in the hot tub before we go.

274
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,773
Where do you want to put it?

275
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:29,819
- In the front.

276
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,203
- [Ellie] 'Kay, do you want me to do it?

277
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:34,358
'Kay, we will put it just right here.

278
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:35,940
(giggling)

279
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,883
What? Why are you laughing at me?

280
00:09:40,116 --> 00:09:44,286
Oh, I'm Spider-Woman.

281
00:09:44,286 --> 00:09:45,500
Rawr!

282
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,673
As for you...

283
00:09:47,673 --> 00:09:50,828
- I want my dog (mumbles).

284
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:52,670
- [Ellie] Your dog can sit right here.

285
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,812
We don't want to lose
your dog at the park.

286
00:09:54,812 --> 00:09:56,170
- No.

287
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,530
- [Ellie] Kiss him and
say, "I'll come back."

288
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,470
Sometimes it's like, it
doesn't really matter,

289
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,740
he can bring the dog to the park.

290
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,860
But I'm just thinking it's just
more responsibility for me.

291
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:06,034
'Kay, let's go.

292
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:08,400
Calvin. 'Kay, hold hands, we'll walk over.

293
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,340
Daddy's gonna grab Penn.

294
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,220
- Hold my hand.

295
00:10:11,245 --> 00:10:12,777
- [Jackson] Hold my hand.

296
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,440
- 'Kay, see you later, guys.

297
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,019
I gotta hold Jackson's hand.

298
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:18,686
(playful music)

299
00:10:26,106 --> 00:10:29,106
- Come down the slide with me, guys.

300
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,110
Did it!

301
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,000
- [Ellie] Hey.

302
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,833
- Hi.

303
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:35,666
- [Ellie] How are ya?

304
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:36,499
- Good, how are you?

305
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:37,332
- [Ellie] Good.

306
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:38,874
- [Jared] Hey, uh, you're
pretty cute, what's your name?

307
00:10:38,874 --> 00:10:41,924
- [Ellie] My name is, my name is Ellie.

308
00:10:41,924 --> 00:10:46,810
Calvin was loving that
Penny was here at the park.

309
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,365
- Oh yeah, he ran, he was like
looking through all the way

310
00:10:49,365 --> 00:10:50,673
to find out how to get out.

311
00:10:50,673 --> 00:10:53,630
- [Ellie] Oh, oh, and
Penny's loving other dogs.

312
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,570
Do you have to stay on
leash here, right here?

313
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,396
- [Jared] Mm-hmm, technically, yeah.

314
00:10:57,396 --> 00:10:58,363
- [Ellie] Oh.

315
00:10:58,363 --> 00:11:00,903
- But at one point, he was
trying to fit his head through.

316
00:11:00,903 --> 00:11:02,725
He was like, trying to push his head,

317
00:11:02,725 --> 00:11:04,284
because he wanted to come say hi.

318
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:07,784
- [Ellie] (laughs) Sorry.

319
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:12,871
Let's go eat, let's go eat.

320
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,871
Calvin's dog is right there.

321
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:18,623
I'm gonna see how long it
takes for him to grab it.

322
00:11:18,623 --> 00:11:20,851
He went to go do flips with Jackson.

323
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,369
- [Jared] What are they scheming together?

324
00:11:22,369 --> 00:11:24,786
(both laugh)

325
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,970
- [Ellie] Oh, his shoe fell off.

326
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,723
Where's your dog?

327
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,513
Go bring it to me so we don't lose him.

328
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,940
Go get him!

329
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,023
Don't say cat speed, go get him!

330
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,870
Today was a fun,
successful day in the sun.

331
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,659
And I'm actually really looking
forward to going to bed.

332
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:50,150
'Cause I know the second
night will always be better.

333
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:53,130
You can sleep anywhere when you
are almost 25 weeks pregnant

334
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,750
if you have a pregnancy pillow with you.

335
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,890
It like made sleeping so nice.

336
00:11:57,890 --> 00:11:59,420
I love that thing!

337
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,102
A day in the sun is exactly what every

338
00:12:01,102 --> 00:12:02,802
single one of us has needed.

339
00:12:02,802 --> 00:12:05,780
Felt so good, thank you
guys so much for watching,

340
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,020
and we'll see you next time.

341
00:12:07,020 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
