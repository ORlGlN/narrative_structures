1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,174
- Good morning!

2
00:00:01,174 --> 00:00:02,007
- Good morning!

3
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,635
- So Ellie is out with her
family today, and we are

4
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:06,521
going to be meeting up with her soon.

5
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:09,051
But before we do that, we
thought it would be fun to

6
00:00:09,051 --> 00:00:12,434
do something exciting with her and us.

7
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:16,327
So today what we are going
to do is the husband and kids

8
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:18,240
buy my clothes challenge.

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,590
So Jackson what that means
is we're going to go to

10
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,590
the store, we're going to
pick out some clothes for mom,

11
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,742
we're going to have her try
them on and see what she thinks.

12
00:00:24,742 --> 00:00:28,143
Now for me, I'm thinking we
do some crazy clothes, we do

13
00:00:28,143 --> 00:00:30,333
some pretty clothes, we
do some beautiful clothes

14
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,691
just whatever we find that
we like, we're going to get

15
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:34,060
for her and have her try it on.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:34,994
Does that sound good?

17
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:35,827
- Yeah.

18
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:38,191
- So I've got some dollars
here just for you, that we're

19
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,796
going to take and we're going
to go get mom some stuff.

20
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:41,629
Sound good?

21
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:42,462
- Yeah.

22
00:00:42,462 --> 00:00:44,288
- Calvin did not want to be
here for this clip right now

23
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,067
but he will be joining us
as well, and he's going to

24
00:00:46,067 --> 00:00:48,630
pick out some clothes
for his mom too, okay?

25
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,736
- Let's go get those clothes,
we'll meet up with mom

26
00:00:50,736 --> 00:00:51,837
and we'll see what she thinks.

27
00:00:51,837 --> 00:00:52,670
- Okay.

28
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,679
- High five. Boop!

29
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,512
- Dalalala!

30
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,843
- Dalalala!

31
00:00:55,843 --> 00:00:58,253
- So we drove down to the
mall and I feel like we're

32
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:00,003
already starting at a disadvantage.

33
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:02,356
The mall that we're going to,
about half the stores inside

34
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:06,037
of it are closed and I'm not
even sure if they're popular

35
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:08,701
stores but, we're going
to work with what we have

36
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,133
and we'll find some good stuff.

37
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:11,642
I'm going to grab the kids out of the car,

38
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:12,942
and we'll get this going.

39
00:01:12,942 --> 00:01:15,478
Don't worry, we'll find
some good stuff in there.

40
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,458
Alright boys, we made it,
what's our goal Jackson?

41
00:01:18,458 --> 00:01:19,291
- Clothes.

42
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:22,241
- Clothes for mom, so I want
you to pick out something for

43
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:24,972
mom, I want you to pick
out something for mom.

44
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,472
Put those eyebrows away, you're not upset.

45
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:31,622
They're a little tired
from the long drive.

46
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:34,083
Calvin, you pick out something
for mom, you pick out

47
00:01:34,083 --> 00:01:36,429
something for mom, and I'll
pick out something for mom.

48
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,262
Got it?

49
00:01:37,262 --> 00:01:38,193
- Yeah, got it!

50
00:01:38,193 --> 00:01:39,100
- Okay, let's go!

51
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,850
(cheerful music)

52
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:46,667
- Oh, pretty!

53
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:49,529
- [Jared] What is, that right there?

54
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:53,012
You think that's pretty for mom?

55
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,006
This right there?

56
00:01:54,006 --> 00:01:54,839
- Yes!

57
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,034
- [Jared] Is that what
you want to get mom?

58
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,240
- Yeah!

59
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,318
- [Jared] Okay, let's see
if they have her size.

60
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:02,764
You know, I think this is
stuff for, like, grandma.

61
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:04,388
Let me look at the price tag

62
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:05,272
(gasps)

63
00:02:05,272 --> 00:02:06,401
I think we'll look somewhere else!

64
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,585
- Purple!

65
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,991
- That is purple!

66
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,386
Which one, that's the one
you want to get for mom?

67
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:12,261
- Yeah!

68
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:13,729
- [Jared] Okay, let's see
if they have her size.

69
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,732
And tell me why you like this.

70
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:18,151
- Because I like it for mom.

71
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,113
- [Jared] You do?

72
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:20,991
Do you like it 'cause
it's pretty, do you think

73
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,248
mom will like it?

74
00:02:22,248 --> 00:02:23,081
- Yeah.

75
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:25,170
- [Jared] Okay, alright, that's one.

76
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,658
That shirt doesn't have
any sleeves so we've gotta

77
00:02:27,658 --> 00:02:29,484
find something to go over
it to cover her shoulders

78
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:30,523
does that sound good?

79
00:02:30,523 --> 00:02:32,796
Can you help me find like a
coat or something to go with it?

80
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,061
- Mommy store.

81
00:02:34,061 --> 00:02:36,164
- [Jared] Yeah, we gotta
get something for mom, okay?

82
00:02:36,164 --> 00:02:36,997
- Store

83
00:02:36,997 --> 00:02:38,181
- [Jared] Yeah, at the store.

84
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:40,085
Can you pick out something for mom?

85
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:41,580
Wait, you wanna put this one back?

86
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,413
- Yeah.

87
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,341
- [Jared] Okay.

88
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:46,415
So I learned a couple things
while shopping with the kids is

89
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:48,528
when they're picking something
for their mom, they'll pick

90
00:02:48,528 --> 00:02:51,125
one thing and put it back, then
they'll pick another thing,

91
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,139
and then put it back.

92
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,029
So we've gone through about
five different outfits with

93
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:57,739
the kids and whatever we
leave with is what we'll take.

94
00:02:57,739 --> 00:02:58,572
- (mumbles)

95
00:02:58,572 --> 00:02:59,405
- Yeah

96
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:03,427
Okay, I just think I found
the secret to success.

97
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:05,141
They have a Bohme.

98
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:07,446
It's right there, I think I'm
going to find a winner there.

99
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:09,005
So these shoes you want for mom?

100
00:03:09,005 --> 00:03:11,083
- Yeah, they're so magical.

101
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,233
- [Jared] They're magical?

102
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,313
(laughs)

103
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:15,530
Okay oh no, we gotta get the
box, we gotta get the box.

104
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,330
Put those ones back, those
are just for display.

105
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,630
We gotta find the box, okay.

106
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,882
Okay, so this is what we
ended up with, I'm just gonna

107
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:23,425
tell you the stores that we picked from.

108
00:03:23,425 --> 00:03:27,226
The kids did everything on
their own I didn't help them,

109
00:03:27,226 --> 00:03:28,282
they picked everything out.

110
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:32,827
So we got Head Over Heels,
Pacsun, and the Bohme.

111
00:03:32,827 --> 00:03:34,405
I hope she likes that we'll find out.

112
00:03:34,405 --> 00:03:35,238
Okay, so--

113
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:36,777
- It's like we're one big happy family.

114
00:03:36,777 --> 00:03:38,821
- Yes it is like we're
one big because we are!

115
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:39,716
(laughs)

116
00:03:39,716 --> 00:03:40,549
- No!

117
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:41,500
(Ellie laughs loudly)

118
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,272
- Oh, what do you mean by that Calvin?

119
00:03:43,272 --> 00:03:45,528
So Ellie has no idea what
we did yesterday, in fact

120
00:03:45,528 --> 00:03:47,669
this is the first time
that she knows about

121
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,569
this video at all.
- Can you get that

122
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:49,578
mummy for me?

123
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:51,468
- We'll get that mummy in just a second.

124
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,010
- I do know that you went somewhere

125
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:53,843
- Yes
- and maybe

126
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:55,718
got something because
Jackson started and you

127
00:03:55,718 --> 00:03:57,215
said "oh, don't say anything yet".

128
00:03:57,215 --> 00:03:59,789
- Jackson do you want to
tell mommy where we went

129
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:00,983
and what we got yesterday?

130
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,791
- I got new clothes for you.

131
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,811
- What?

132
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:05,513
- Yeah, we got new clothes for you.

133
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:08,872
So today we are doing the
husband and kids buy my

134
00:04:08,872 --> 00:04:10,124
clothes challenge.

135
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,490
- Jackson!

136
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,636
Was that boring or fun?

137
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:14,521
- Boring.

138
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,554
(Jared laughs)

139
00:04:15,554 --> 00:04:18,721
- Did you pick out the
clothes for mom or did dad?

140
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:21,372
- So we each picked out one outfit.

141
00:04:21,373 --> 00:04:23,136
I picked out an outfit,
- What!?

142
00:04:23,136 --> 00:04:26,465
- Jackson did, and even Calvin.

143
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:30,514
- This is very exciting, I'm
glad this challenge exists!

144
00:04:30,514 --> 00:04:32,197
Thank you.
- So we are going to start

145
00:04:32,197 --> 00:04:33,949
with, who do you want to
start with first let's put

146
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:35,803
it up to you, do you want to
start with mine, Jackson's,

147
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:36,744
or Calvin's?

148
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:39,421
- Let's start with yours Jackson
you sound like you had fun.

149
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:41,532
It was a little boring but
fun 'cause you got a prize

150
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:42,523
at the end, huh?

151
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,342
- You guys stay right
here I'll go grab 'em.

152
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:46,981
- What, this is crazy!

153
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:50,732
I feel very spoiled like
my three boys over there

154
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:52,485
grabbing stuff.

155
00:04:52,485 --> 00:04:54,515
So tell me how it went,
them picking it out.

156
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:56,781
Did they really pick it out?
- Okay, so

157
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,231
- They really picked it out.

158
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,762
I helped direct them, I said "Jackson we

159
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,406
need pants
- Even shoes!?

160
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:04,279
- "We need shirt" and he
wanted shoes, he picked out the

161
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,764
shoes specifically.

162
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,043
(Ellie laughs)

163
00:05:07,043 --> 00:05:09,906
And I didn't help them
at all other than saying

164
00:05:09,906 --> 00:05:12,693
"we need these items" and
then he picked out which ones.

165
00:05:12,693 --> 00:05:13,526
(gasps)

166
00:05:13,526 --> 00:05:15,882
- Oh, cute he's holding
the box up in front of me

167
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:16,872
with the shoes.

168
00:05:16,872 --> 00:05:18,421
- Mommy do you see that?

169
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:19,646
- Yes.

170
00:05:19,646 --> 00:05:21,457
- You're gonna die
- So he picked em out?

171
00:05:21,457 --> 00:05:22,845
(gasps)

172
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:26,205
(Jared laughs)

173
00:05:26,205 --> 00:05:30,226
That looks like the nail
polish I wore when I was 12!

174
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,226
Those are...

175
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,018
Wow!

176
00:05:34,018 --> 00:05:35,078
- Want to try them on?

177
00:05:35,078 --> 00:05:36,231
- Sure, I would love to!

178
00:05:36,231 --> 00:05:38,078
- So that's what you have to
do is you have to go into the

179
00:05:38,078 --> 00:05:39,390
other room and try these on
- Okay!

180
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,911
- And model them for us.

181
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:43,930
- I mean those are eye catching
and unique but, in a way

182
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,240
they're kind of really cute, I mean.

183
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,725
- I feel like it's something
Elton John or Michael Jackson

184
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:49,642
would wear.

185
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:51,930
- Try them on.

186
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,763
- Okay.
- Okay, so show us

187
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,596
(laughs loudly)

188
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:54,953
Show us what you got here.

189
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:56,409
(Ellie squeals)

190
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:59,088
- Well first, the pants are cute.

191
00:05:59,088 --> 00:06:00,436
- I can put em on too.

192
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:03,161
- Aw and I need some pants, thank you.

193
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:04,943
He's trying on the shoes right now.

194
00:06:04,943 --> 00:06:06,649
- He picked out the size too so

195
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,228
I hope it's okay.
- I hope you filmed that

196
00:06:08,228 --> 00:06:09,904
- That's cute did you?

197
00:06:09,904 --> 00:06:11,245
- I did as much as I could, I had two

198
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,193
kids by myself in the mall.
- Aw and he picked

199
00:06:13,193 --> 00:06:14,838
out this shirt?

200
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:17,671
Jackson, and that matches so cute.

201
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,582
Jackson okay.

202
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:21,567
- Okay go try them on.

203
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:22,631
(Ellie squeals)

204
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:25,214
- [Ellie] Jared, this is so fun

205
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,856
are you kidding me!

206
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:31,226
Are you kidding me!

207
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,752
They're actually so cute!

208
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:35,589
- That actually looks really good!

209
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,509
- I'm not even kidding you
I can't smack the smile off

210
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:39,876
my face 'cause I think it's--

211
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,640
Jackson!
- We have to show these

212
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,581
shoes off!

213
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:44,468
- That Jackson picked these out!

214
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:45,670
(Jared laughs)

215
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,536
Jackson!

216
00:06:46,536 --> 00:06:48,811
I think they're cute!

217
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,053
I'm gonna wear them!
- Is that fun?

218
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:50,945
- Is that cool?

219
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:51,778
- Yes!

220
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:52,611
- I like the pants a lot!

221
00:06:52,611 --> 00:06:53,890
- Do you like the shoes?

222
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,876
- Yeah and the shoes are like they're fun.

223
00:06:55,876 --> 00:06:58,893
- They're a little interesting
but I actually think

224
00:06:58,893 --> 00:06:59,743
they're cute.

225
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:02,128
- This shirt is really nice
on you the fit is so good.

226
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:03,569
- Thanks!

227
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,519
- I'm kind of nervous for my outfit now.

228
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,689
- Jackson, thank you.

229
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:09,660
Are you kidding me!?

230
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,657
These could be the

231
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:12,482
nicest pants
- You like them

232
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:16,071
I've ever owned I mean
they are stretchy and comfy

233
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:17,762
where did he find them?

234
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:20,258
- Head Over Heels, I think is where?

235
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,324
- It's cute!

236
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,666
(Ellie laughs)

237
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:24,207
The shoes are so different
but I actually think

238
00:07:24,207 --> 00:07:25,540
they're so cute!

239
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,975
I would never pick those out!

240
00:07:28,975 --> 00:07:30,379
I'm gonna wear 'em!

241
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,496
This is the cutest video Jared, thank you!

242
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,668
- This is Calvin's pick.

243
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:38,318
- And how did that work?

244
00:07:38,318 --> 00:07:42,425
- Same exact way I took him
over to the bottoms and I said

245
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:44,431
"pick one" and he picked one.

246
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,095
And I took him to the tops
and I told him to pick one

247
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:47,928
and he picked one.

248
00:07:47,928 --> 00:07:48,761
(Ellie laughs)

249
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:49,690
That's all.

250
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,214
- Oh, thank you.

251
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:53,372
Interesting color, I see.

252
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,970
(Ellie giggles)

253
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:55,911
Oh, it's a skirt!

254
00:07:55,911 --> 00:07:56,744
- It's a skirt.

255
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,395
(Ellie laughs)

256
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,774
- Okay, it looks like it
would actually be really fun

257
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:05,326
for winter if I had a very
cool top, neutral top.

258
00:08:05,326 --> 00:08:07,941
Can I see what else is in the bag?

259
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:08,931
- The receipt!

260
00:08:08,931 --> 00:08:10,156
That's your top!
- Might want that!

261
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:10,989
(Ellie laughs)

262
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,431
- I was going to say you may
want to hold on to that buddy.

263
00:08:13,431 --> 00:08:16,181
- Aw, that looks just like Momma,

264
00:08:17,198 --> 00:08:19,821
that looks like me, flowers.

265
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,204
Okay I'm gonna try it on
- Okay go try it on

266
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:22,736
- Thanks Calverino!

267
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,506
Thank you baby you got
stuff on your hand you go

268
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,376
wipe them off.

269
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:28,623
Okay I'll try these on, this is cute.

270
00:08:28,623 --> 00:08:30,628
- I'm ready for round two!

271
00:08:30,628 --> 00:08:31,461
Oh baby!

272
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,660
(Jared laughs)

273
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,006
Ellie, that is so funny.
- What do you think?

274
00:08:39,006 --> 00:08:40,115
- That is so funny.

275
00:08:40,116 --> 00:08:41,431
(Ellie laughs)

276
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:44,450
Do you like any of them I
think the shirt's pretty cute.

277
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,267
- The shirt's okay for like
the lounge day with a sweater

278
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,767
I'd probably wear.

279
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:53,214
The skirt really isn't bad.

280
00:08:53,214 --> 00:08:57,068
I probably wouldn't normally
pick such huge flowers, but

281
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:57,968
it's cute.

282
00:08:57,968 --> 00:08:59,526
- Pretty good for a two year old.

283
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:01,918
- Pretty good for a cute
little two year old.

284
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,945
It's cute, thanks Calvin.

285
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:05,028
(Jared giggles)

286
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,560
He's so cute.
- That's so fun.

287
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,040
- My boys are good to me.

288
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,699
That was cute, Jackson.

289
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,121
This is really cute of you.

290
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,284
- It's kind of fun, huh?

291
00:09:13,284 --> 00:09:15,854
- It's really cute that
the boys were involved.

292
00:09:15,854 --> 00:09:17,384
- So here, this is my outfit.

293
00:09:17,384 --> 00:09:18,217
(Ellie squeals)

294
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:21,791
Now I tried really hard, I
really tried and I wanted

295
00:09:21,791 --> 00:09:23,791
to make it look good and

296
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:27,240
not something that you would

297
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,790
100% normally go to, I
kind of took what you

298
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,736
have been doing and maybe
pushed a little bit more.

299
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:35,544
So that's what I was going for here.

300
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:36,377
- Okay

301
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:39,653
- So let's start off with
this, just a light wash jean.

302
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:40,736
- Cute, cute.

303
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:43,244
Is that why you,

304
00:09:43,244 --> 00:09:45,106
last night Jared came
home and he was like,

305
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,911
"What size pant are you?" I'm like.

306
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:47,802
(Jared laughs)

307
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:49,970
- I had to make sure but I
bought it before I checked.

308
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,203
- That's cute.

309
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:53,870
- Then I got this little jacket.

310
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,378
- That is so cute and so soft.

311
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:00,189
- And this shirt, blouse?

312
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:02,000
(gasps)

313
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,917
- Oh, cute!

314
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:08,028
Yeah, a little different it
would be cute under that jacket.

315
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:10,266
- And then to top it all off

316
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,631
a hat.
- That's so

317
00:10:11,631 --> 00:10:14,603
cute, I saw that and I
thought "oh my gosh!"

318
00:10:14,603 --> 00:10:16,059
- I'm nervous to see what
(Ellie squeals)

319
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:18,584
it looks like all together so
go ahead and give it a shot.

320
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:19,969
- Thanks!

321
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:20,802
- You ready?

322
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:21,635
- Yep!

323
00:10:21,635 --> 00:10:23,135
- Bring it on out.

324
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:26,805
You have to tell me what you think.

325
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:28,307
What do you think?

326
00:10:28,307 --> 00:10:29,482
Get a little closer!
- I love

327
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:30,315
the hat,

328
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,720
the pants are cute and loung-ey.

329
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,553
- Yeah.

330
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:36,844
- And I really like the top,

331
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,624
I might pair it differently

332
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:40,191
when I wear it but
- Okay tell me what you

333
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:41,730
would pair it with.
- I love all the pieces.

334
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,563
- Parrot.

335
00:10:42,563 --> 00:10:45,234
- I don't know maybe people can tell me.

336
00:10:45,234 --> 00:10:46,233
I like the hat--
- I think it's stinking cute--

337
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,066
- No!

338
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,982
I think it's cute I'm wondering
how it's all put together.

339
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:50,815
- Yeah.

340
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:51,648
- What do you think?

341
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:53,423
- Well you know I always
think you look like

342
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:54,775
a million bucks.

343
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:56,535
- What do you think though,
putting it together?

344
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:57,493
- I really like it.

345
00:10:57,493 --> 00:10:58,406
- Do you think it all matches?

346
00:10:58,406 --> 00:10:59,757
- I think it totally does.
- Okay!

347
00:10:59,757 --> 00:11:01,005
- If I saw you walking

348
00:11:01,005 --> 00:11:01,838
down the street
- Really!?

349
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:02,671
- I'd be like "hey girl, hey!"

350
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,710
I really would.
- Well, thank you.

351
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,909
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

352
00:11:05,909 --> 00:11:09,246
- I like that they're not like so tight.

353
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,661
- Thank you yes, I do like
the pants and I normally would

354
00:11:11,661 --> 00:11:13,774
not find or wear pants that like these.

355
00:11:13,774 --> 00:11:16,316
They're not just skinny fit
- Yeah.

356
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:19,404
- it's just kind of a little more loose.

357
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:20,286
- How'd I do?

358
00:11:20,286 --> 00:11:23,797
- You did great, I love the
hat, I'm just only wondering

359
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:24,692
if the
- Yeah, if there's something

360
00:11:24,692 --> 00:11:26,462
else that you could do it
- if the jacket matches the

361
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:27,664
shirt and the hat I wonder.

362
00:11:27,664 --> 00:11:30,778
- And that was my biggest
concern is because they didn't

363
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:33,700
have a lot of different color
hats, and I didn't think

364
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:37,393
I wanted to know if they
gray and the tan would clash.

365
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:39,713
They had a black hat, and I
was like "that's too close

366
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:40,589
to black".
- No, I love this hat.

367
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:41,422
- Yeah.

368
00:11:41,422 --> 00:11:44,093
- I love it though, I love all
the pieces, I may wear it a

369
00:11:44,093 --> 00:11:45,997
little differently though, together.

370
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,138
This was really cute.

371
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:48,021
(Jared laughs)

372
00:11:48,021 --> 00:11:49,379
- Yeah, I--
- I'm being honest you wanted

373
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,590
me to be honest, right?
- I think it's a lot of--

374
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,879
yeah, oh 100%
- I'm not, okay.

375
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,539
- I don't want you to fabricate anything.

376
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:54,723
- No, no I love it.

377
00:11:54,723 --> 00:11:56,128
- Good, I think it looks really

378
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:57,289
really good on you
- Thank you.

379
00:11:57,289 --> 00:11:58,330
- I really do.

380
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,766
- This was so cute!
- I'm really happy with how

381
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:00,961
it turned out.

382
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,469
- Who won the best outfit?

383
00:12:02,469 --> 00:12:03,431
- Calvin!
- Jackson,

384
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,264
Calvin or dad?

385
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,772
- Calvin did for sure.

386
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:06,621
(Ellie laughs)

387
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:09,268
Calvin's was freaking hilarious,
although Jackson's shoes

388
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:10,458
were really funny.

389
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:12,108
- I actually kind of like them.

390
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,481
- Okay, here's a better
question, what are you going

391
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,340
to take back?

392
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,664
We have the receipts for everything.

393
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:17,813
What are you going to take back?

394
00:12:17,813 --> 00:12:21,828
- I like the shirt, I probably
would take the skirt back.

395
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:22,661
- The skirt back?

396
00:12:22,661 --> 00:12:23,494
- That's probably what I wouldn't

397
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,577
wear anyway
- Is that the only thing

398
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,323
that you're going to take
back, you're going to keep

399
00:12:26,323 --> 00:12:27,156
everything else?

400
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:29,335
- Yeah, I think I really
love this, totally.

401
00:12:29,335 --> 00:12:31,007
Thank you.
- To me that is the biggest

402
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,456
success of them all.
- No, totally.

403
00:12:32,456 --> 00:12:33,289
- Yeah.

404
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,673
- I love this, I mean
the pants are so cute.

405
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:39,337
This is what I think, because
you told me to be honest.

406
00:12:39,337 --> 00:12:40,328
- Yes!

407
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:44,482
- I think that this is such a
nice shirt, and so I probably

408
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:47,408
would wear the shirt and the
hat together with a nicer

409
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:49,933
just like pair of pants,

410
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,787
but I love it all.

411
00:12:51,787 --> 00:12:55,265
It is so, the shirt is cute
and this is something I would

412
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:58,470
pick out a while ago, but I
haven't picked out something

413
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,070
as fancy, you know, like the
lace and stuff in a while.

414
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,903
It's cute.

415
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,514
- So here's what I want to do,
let me know in the comments

416
00:13:04,514 --> 00:13:06,715
down below if you think
these pants go good with this

417
00:13:06,715 --> 00:13:08,769
outfit, or if you think Ellie should,

418
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:09,760
like she said, tighten it up

419
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,959
with something a little bit sleeker.

420
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,792
- Yeah.

421
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:12,924
- Let me know in the comments below.

422
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:13,795
- I love Jackson's,

423
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:15,827
that one is so
- That is so cute and simple

424
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:16,660
and beautiful.

425
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,493
- And so me.

426
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:18,326
- Yeah.

427
00:13:18,326 --> 00:13:20,657
- And the pants were perfect
and I'm like, it takes me

428
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:23,047
forever to find pants,
bring a three year old.

429
00:13:23,047 --> 00:13:25,610
- Well, it was so funny
because the entire time I was

430
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,017
shopping I was just, the first
thought in my head is like

431
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:31,466
"how do these ladies do it,
going to the mall with kids?"

432
00:13:31,466 --> 00:13:34,104
I had a one seat stroller,
not the double stroller

433
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,190
so that made it harder.

434
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,454
But then just finding the
time to even go in and try

435
00:13:37,454 --> 00:13:40,135
things on, I was getting a
little frustrated, so I have

436
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,522
to give you guys props
- Yeah, awww.

437
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:44,181
- But it was fun, we had a good
time and I made it fun with

438
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:45,014
the kids.

439
00:13:45,014 --> 00:13:48,066
I just thought it would be fun
to do this for you and to see

440
00:13:48,066 --> 00:13:49,264
your reaction to it.

441
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:52,843
- Well it was very fun, this
was so cute of you, thank you.

442
00:13:52,843 --> 00:13:53,676
- You're welcome.
- Thoughtful too.

443
00:13:53,676 --> 00:13:54,509
- You're welcome.

444
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,342
- Thanks.

445
00:13:55,342 --> 00:13:58,373
- On the next video it's
going to be wife buys my

446
00:13:58,373 --> 00:13:59,404
gaming console.

447
00:13:59,404 --> 00:14:00,237
- No!

448
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:02,482
(laughs)

449
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:04,580
- But that's actually it for
the video, thank you guys

450
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,497
so much for watching, if you

451
00:14:05,497 --> 00:14:06,732
enjoyed it give it a
- I'll buy you a game console

452
00:14:06,732 --> 00:14:07,984
- big thumbs up okay I'll take it.

453
00:14:07,984 --> 00:14:08,817
(Ellie laughs)

454
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:11,029
- One of these days we'll
do another round of this,

455
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:14,143
and we'll do the "husband
buys my makeup challenge"

456
00:14:14,143 --> 00:14:17,775
'cause I'd love to go in
and do something there too.

457
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:21,907
- Jared is very sweet and
what I really enjoy about

458
00:14:21,907 --> 00:14:25,850
our relationship is Jared
is into what I like.

459
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,357
I feel like I try to
reciprocate that as well.

460
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:29,190
- Absolutely

461
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,289
- Because, even though we
are into different things or

462
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:35,219
different hobbies or,
we like different things

463
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:37,977
I think that you're really
cute to try and learn

464
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:38,810
- Yeah

465
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:39,643
- what I like
- I wouldn't say

466
00:14:39,643 --> 00:14:42,475
I wouldn't necessarily like
I'm into it, I would say

467
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:43,586
I listen when you
- Yeah.

468
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:45,156
- Are talking about
- Yeah.

469
00:14:45,156 --> 00:14:46,814
- Those things, and I
make note of those things.

470
00:14:46,814 --> 00:14:50,096
- Yeah, when I get frustrated
or whatever you're really

471
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,233
good to listen.

472
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,066
- Yeah.

473
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,314
- And then I feel like I'm that way too

474
00:14:53,314 --> 00:14:54,147
- Absolutely
- When you are

475
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:57,493
trying to find the new pixel
XL camera or phone or I don't

476
00:14:57,493 --> 00:14:59,839
even know what I'm saying
but, you know what I mean?

477
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,672
- Absolutely!

478
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:01,505
- So thank you.

479
00:15:01,505 --> 00:15:02,962
- Hey, communication, listening.

480
00:15:02,962 --> 00:15:04,042
- That was cute.

481
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:04,875
- This is fun.

482
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,708
- You're the best.

483
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,327
- Alright guys, we'll see you next time.

484
00:15:07,327 --> 00:15:08,160
- Bye.

485
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:08,993
- Bye.

486
00:15:08,993 --> 00:15:10,478
- That was cute.

487
00:15:10,478 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
