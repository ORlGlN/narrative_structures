1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:02,873
(playful music)

2
00:00:14,937 --> 00:00:17,095
- Ellie, I got another
text message from Brian.

3
00:00:17,095 --> 00:00:19,039
He is not stopping with this, he keeps

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,731
going on about it.
- What?

5
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:22,981
- He wants us to do the
Pumpkin Spice Challenge.

6
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,740
- I want to do it.
- Okay.

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,770
- After I tell my mom Happy Birthday.

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:29,248
- That's a little more
important, wouldn't you say?

9
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,002
- There we go. Got it.

10
00:00:31,002 --> 00:00:34,531
- Posted it, it's official.
Happy birthday, Mom. (laughs)

11
00:00:34,531 --> 00:00:37,026
Seriously, though, today
is Ellie's mom's birthday,

12
00:00:37,026 --> 00:00:38,597
so happy birthday to her, go and

13
00:00:38,597 --> 00:00:40,568
wish her a very happy birthday.

14
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:42,737
We're gonna go pick up
Jackson from school,

15
00:00:42,737 --> 00:00:43,861
we're gonna go to the grocery store,

16
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:45,121
and we're gonna pick up some things,

17
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,646
some pumpkin spice things.

18
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,487
- Calvin, let's go!
- We gotta go, Calvin.

19
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:49,917
It's time to get some pumpkin spice.

20
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,077
- Before I dropped Jackson off at school,

21
00:00:51,077 --> 00:00:52,625
he goes, because I was
getting my list ready,

22
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:54,497
he goes, "Don't go without me!

23
00:00:54,497 --> 00:00:56,203
"I don't wanna go to school!"

24
00:00:56,203 --> 00:00:57,758
I was like, "I will wait for you

25
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,487
"and then I will take
you grocery shopping."

26
00:00:59,487 --> 00:01:01,126
- (laughs) He likes to push the cart.

27
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:03,347
I don't blame him one bit.
- This high!

28
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:04,953
- [Jared] You think we
can build it higher?

29
00:01:04,953 --> 00:01:06,105
- Yeah.
- [Jared] I dunno.

30
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:08,795
It's already pretty tall.
Oh my goodness.

31
00:01:08,795 --> 00:01:11,547
- I'm gonna knock it over.
- No, don't knock it over!

32
00:01:11,547 --> 00:01:13,111
(dominoes clatter)

33
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,427
You know what that means?

34
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:16,690
We just have to build it again.

35
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,864
Just touch this one,
knock this one over, okay?

36
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:20,855
Just that one, okay, Jackson?

37
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:24,438
(dominoes clatter)
- Whoa.

38
00:01:27,205 --> 00:01:28,954
We have a few places here

39
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,905
in town that is like this environment

40
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,724
where they have toys and stuff for kids

41
00:01:32,724 --> 00:01:34,607
or adults to play with, and
it's kind of our, just like--

42
00:01:34,607 --> 00:01:36,289
- [Jackson] We have only games!

43
00:01:36,289 --> 00:01:39,113
- And only games, just kind
of like a relaxing feel.

44
00:01:39,113 --> 00:01:42,450
We are waiting to have
Jared's parents come

45
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,931
and then we're gonna eat with them.

46
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:45,335
- Yeah, this one, then this one,

47
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:46,783
then this one, then this one!

48
00:01:46,783 --> 00:01:49,175
- [Ellie] Yep, yep, yep.
- All of these ones.

49
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:52,945
Just three.
(Ellie laughs)

50
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,839
Or four.
- [Ellie] I think you're cute.

51
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:56,854
Guess what?

52
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:59,322
I didn't go grocery shopping yet.

53
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:01,970
I waited so you could come with me.

54
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,637
(playful music)

55
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:19,621
- Grandma and Grandpa
have this amazing garden

56
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:21,525
and they grew pumpkins this year.

57
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:22,899
Are you gonna pick one?

58
00:02:22,899 --> 00:02:25,066
- I'm gonna pick this one.

59
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,680
- [Jared] Wow, that looks like

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,335
a perfect pumpkin for Jackson.

61
00:02:29,335 --> 00:02:34,159
What about you, Calvin?
(Calvin babbles, excited)

62
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,736
A green one?
Do you wanna know something?

63
00:02:37,736 --> 00:02:39,653
Those green ones are actually watermelons.

64
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,288
- No, they're not!
(Jared laughs)

65
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:43,423
What about this pumpkin right here?

66
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,737
Do you like that pumpkin?

67
00:02:44,737 --> 00:02:46,095
- [Jared] That's a nice pumpkin.

68
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:47,471
These all came from your garden.

69
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,433
- Yeah!
- These look so good, Mom.

70
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:52,007
Like look at this one, that's so perfect.

71
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,674
- I think we should paint them tonight.

72
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,640
- [Jared] That would be fun.

73
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,478
Would you like to paint a pumpkin?

74
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,575
- Yeah.
- [Jared] Okay.

75
00:02:58,575 --> 00:02:59,834
- I wanna paint these ones.
- [Jared] All right.

76
00:02:59,834 --> 00:03:01,076
- [Ellie] Excuse me, mister, what

77
00:03:01,076 --> 00:03:03,040
are you using the marshmallows for?

78
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,207
- They're my, the pillow.
- The pillow?

79
00:03:07,243 --> 00:03:08,557
Okay, well, I guess we won't have

80
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:10,167
a yummy snack for dinner.

81
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,833
- I want a snack for dinner!

82
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:12,874
- Okay, after dinner, I mean.

83
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:14,654
Jackson's helping me make a little snack

84
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:16,473
because tonight we are
doing pumpkin painting

85
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:18,315
and he really wanted to make a treat

86
00:03:18,315 --> 00:03:20,206
so we're gonna make Rice Krispie treats,

87
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:22,148
and I'm gonna tell you my secret.

88
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:24,813
It's not really a secret,
it's just how I like to

89
00:03:24,813 --> 00:03:26,359
I don't like to follow directions,

90
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:28,099
I just do four tablespoons of butter,

91
00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:30,618
and I melt mini marshmallows because it's

92
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:32,929
really hard to melt bigger marshmallows,

93
00:03:32,929 --> 00:03:35,996
because like you overburn it or something,

94
00:03:35,996 --> 00:03:39,103
so I do mini marshmallows, and I just add

95
00:03:39,103 --> 00:03:42,073
enough Rice Krispies
until it's still gooey,

96
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,286
because sometimes if you follow

97
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:45,373
the directions, it's not gooey enough.

98
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,364
- Mama, open this thing.
- Okay.

99
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:50,124
You sit there and punch it
open while I finish dinner.

100
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:51,457
I'm making dinner first.

101
00:03:51,457 --> 00:03:54,476
We'll have a snack and paint
pumpkins when Calvin wakes up

102
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:57,726
or we'll just kick 'em into the ground.

103
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:00,766
Pick the marshmallows
up, all the way high.

104
00:04:00,766 --> 00:04:03,220
Whoo!
- Marshmallows!

105
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,598
- [Ellie] Okay, good job.

106
00:04:04,598 --> 00:04:06,637
Can you mix this for me?
- Sure.

107
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:08,419
- Okay.
It's kinda hard having

108
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,309
kids help because you want them to help

109
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:13,726
and they wanna help, but
you don't want anyone burnt.

110
00:04:13,726 --> 00:04:16,226
Okay, mix that up really good.

111
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,616
Jackson wanted to actually
film and so I'm gonna

112
00:04:20,616 --> 00:04:24,663
let him do that because that
was probably the safer option.

113
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:27,479
So in here, the marshmallows
aren't quite melted,

114
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,227
and I put the Rice Krispies in
before everything is melted.

115
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:34,839
- There is still more in.
- [Ellie] Just a few.

116
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:37,768
- All of them.
- [Ellie] Perfect.

117
00:04:37,768 --> 00:04:40,910
Okay, start dumping that in.
- It's heavy.

118
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,327
- It is heavy.
Whoa, good job.

119
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:50,876
Good job.
Now do you wanna mix it?

120
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,293
Good job.
You are such a help.

121
00:04:55,779 --> 00:04:58,157
It really is so helpful lately,

122
00:04:58,157 --> 00:05:00,315
I've been asking Jackson a little more,

123
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:02,064
like, "Can you go grab this for me?

124
00:05:02,064 --> 00:05:03,993
"Can you go grab me a wipe?"

125
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:05,804
and you've been so helpful, and he's

126
00:05:05,804 --> 00:05:07,602
becoming to the age
where he's a lot better

127
00:05:07,602 --> 00:05:09,203
at helping pick up, like it used to be

128
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:11,251
where we would pick up toys and he would

129
00:05:11,251 --> 00:05:13,724
like not even help whatsoever, even if we

130
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,093
like tried to make him, you know,

131
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,487
it was like, he'd pick up one thing

132
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:18,997
and that was about it, but you've just

133
00:05:18,997 --> 00:05:21,021
been really good at helping more, huh?

134
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:23,065
You've been picking up your toys

135
00:05:23,065 --> 00:05:25,773
and making your bed more.

136
00:05:25,773 --> 00:05:28,873
You've been a good helper, thanks.

137
00:05:28,873 --> 00:05:32,124
(playful music)

138
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:33,976
How's it taste?
- Good.

139
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:35,165
- Do you guys remember on Sunday

140
00:05:35,165 --> 00:05:37,756
how we were talking about
getting the kids to eat food

141
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,456
and it was just a matter of getting them

142
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,129
like to try a bite to realize that they

143
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:43,328
like it and everything,
well, scratch everything!

144
00:05:43,328 --> 00:05:46,269
Everything I said is wrong!
(laughs)

145
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:49,044
- He did try it, and he didn't like it.

146
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,428
- (laughs) No, I'm just kidding,

147
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:52,274
but this is a meal, like this is

148
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:54,181
a challenge that we're going through.

149
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,476
I want you to take a b--

150
00:05:55,476 --> 00:05:57,033
Calvin's gonna try and eat your food.

151
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:59,357
Calvin is chowing this down, but

152
00:05:59,357 --> 00:06:01,314
Jackson, on the other hand, is not,

153
00:06:01,314 --> 00:06:04,699
so this is spaghetti with
some meat and tomatoes,

154
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,647
it's really great, you want a bite?

155
00:06:06,647 --> 00:06:09,147
There you go, good boy, you
eat it all up and everything.

156
00:06:09,147 --> 00:06:11,788
That was, okay, Jackson, I want you

157
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,934
to take one more big boy bite, okay?

158
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:16,552
- I don't want to.
- Okay, look.

159
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:18,150
Look, see, this is the last one

160
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,719
that you've gotta take, okay?

161
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:22,413
All right, look at you, showing off.

162
00:06:22,413 --> 00:06:24,700
He's like, "Oh look Mom, I did it."

163
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,033
Here you go.
Slurp it all up.

164
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:30,932
Slurp it all up, it's spaghetti.

165
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,703
That's the best part of eating spaghetti.

166
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:36,581
My point in all of this is
just to say, you know ...

167
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:38,832
- One day works, the next it doesn't,

168
00:06:38,832 --> 00:06:40,930
with anything and everything.
- Exactly.

169
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,682
And you just have to keep at it.

170
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:44,680
- Today is my mom's
birthday, like we said,

171
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,930
Happy Birthday, I love
talking to her on the phone,

172
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,673
and as I'm sitting here eating dinner

173
00:06:49,673 --> 00:06:52,158
I'm thinking about her
because all growing up,

174
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:54,811
she always planned the
meals, she always cooked,

175
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:57,440
and I just, that is something that

176
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,413
I really appreciated, and
not at the time, I didn't,

177
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:03,822
but now I do, and because I
think that's really hard work,

178
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:06,802
like whether you're on your own,

179
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:10,503
whether you have kids, or it's
just you and your husband,

180
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,046
it is hard to come up with meals,

181
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,449
to cook morning, lunch, and dinner,

182
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:17,826
and my mom always did that.

183
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:20,883
If we ever went out to eat,
we would order Chinese food,

184
00:07:20,883 --> 00:07:22,646
and that was like our main thing.

185
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:24,230
That and pizza once in a while,

186
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,906
but we never just went out to eat,

187
00:07:25,906 --> 00:07:28,065
and I'm really grateful
for my mom and her cooking.

188
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,505
Your mom did the same.
- Absolutely.

189
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:30,780
- [Ellie] Cooked lots,

190
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,746
and we try.
(laughs)

191
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:34,449
- Except for us it was
pizza and Taco Bell.

192
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,908
- Oh, fun.
That was fun.

193
00:07:36,908 --> 00:07:39,194
But I just appreciate my mom and all

194
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:41,651
the hard work that she
always did for her kids,

195
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:44,098
stuff that, little things like that

196
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:46,573
that are not little ...
(clatters)

197
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:48,599
We've got juice and noodles
flying all over the kitchen.

198
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,193
But those things are, they aren't little.

199
00:07:51,193 --> 00:07:53,150
They seem basic, but they aren't,

200
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,042
and I really do appreciate it.

201
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,709
(playful music)

202
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,270
- So I'm filming a little B roll,

203
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,646
and I just noticed,
Calvin has two pumpkins,

204
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:12,303
and he's switching back and forth.

205
00:08:12,303 --> 00:08:14,012
I just think that, for some reason

206
00:08:14,012 --> 00:08:15,310
that's the funniest thing to me.

207
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,179
- Had to get lucky and get two.

208
00:08:17,179 --> 00:08:20,061
- [Jared] So we're painting pumpkins, yay!

209
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,041
Is this fun, Jackson?
- I got paint on my hands.

210
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,427
- [Jared] Uh-oh, guess what?
It's super washable paint

211
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,374
and we'll be just fine if we take a bath.

212
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,323
That's not your pumpkin!

213
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:31,496
What are you painting on your pumpkin?

214
00:08:31,496 --> 00:08:33,315
- Me!
- [Jared] You?

215
00:08:33,315 --> 00:08:34,751
Me?
- Blue.

216
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:37,662
- [Jared] Blue.
- And dark blue.

217
00:08:37,662 --> 00:08:38,931
- [Jared] Blue and dark blue.

218
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:40,312
Those are two of my favorite colors.

219
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,010
Oh wow, Jackson, that's
really cool-looking.

220
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,033
Little swirlage action there.

221
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,930
Calvin's got the green machine right here,

222
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,039
green and blue, and Ellie ...

223
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:51,432
You're going all out with the blueness.

224
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:55,031
Dah bah dee dah bah die, or
something like that, I dunno.

225
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:58,127
Hot glue guns, look at all
these accessories we've got.

226
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,000
- This is your mom's.

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,761
I'm so sorry, we borrowed it

228
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,559
and a year later we still have it.

229
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:05,217
- I've got some fun ideas for my pumpkin

230
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:06,726
so I'm gonna go ahead and get started.

231
00:09:06,726 --> 00:09:08,534
- After it dries up, I wanna go

232
00:09:08,534 --> 00:09:10,030
to Grandma's house and show.

233
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,623
- [Jared] Oh, and that would be so fun.

234
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,974
- I think she'll love it.
- [Jared] Yeah.

235
00:09:13,974 --> 00:09:15,486
Especially because some of these

236
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:16,946
pumpkins are hers, that she gave us.

237
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:19,613
(playful music)

238
00:09:21,814 --> 00:09:24,814
- He just spilled paint all over me.

239
00:09:26,354 --> 00:09:29,568
- [Ellie] I don't think
he meant to, I'm sorry.

240
00:09:29,568 --> 00:09:30,819
That flew pretty far, I even think

241
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:32,278
he got some green on Penny's head.

242
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,273
Right there, there's some green.

243
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,940
(playful music)

244
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:53,275
- [Jared] Do you wanna see it?
Okay, open your eyes.

245
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,684
- You are the best.

246
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,806
- [Jared] (laughs) Is that cool?

247
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,939
- You're the best.
- It's a-me, Mario.

248
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,160
Of all the things I could forget,

249
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,382
knowing me, Jared Mecham,
I forgot his eyebrows.

250
00:10:05,382 --> 00:10:08,245
No wonder he looks so funny.
Hold that thought.

251
00:10:08,245 --> 00:10:10,412
(singing)

252
00:10:25,086 --> 00:10:27,028
- [Ellie] Did you learn that at preschool?

253
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,225
- Yeah.
- [Ellie] I like that song.

254
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,958
Let's see your hands, how
much they got painted.

255
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,463
Oh, let's go take a bath.

256
00:10:34,463 --> 00:10:37,284
- Here's the final product on the porch,

257
00:10:37,284 --> 00:10:40,555
and everything, these
pumpkins look so great.

258
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:43,330
These are like honestly my
favorite kinds of pumpkins

259
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:46,274
because the kids just have
so much fun with them.

260
00:10:46,274 --> 00:10:48,329
It's just them having fun, it's a blast.

261
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:50,295
And we haven't even got to the best part,

262
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:53,344
which is pumpkin carving!
Ooh, I'm so excited.

263
00:10:53,344 --> 00:10:55,200
Gotta go back through that one video

264
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,246
and see which comment
has the most thumbs up

265
00:10:57,246 --> 00:10:59,084
to see if I can actually do it.

266
00:10:59,084 --> 00:11:00,594
I've been cleaning around the house

267
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:01,982
while Ellie's been getting the kids to bed

268
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:05,642
and I think she and Calvin
fell asleep in Jackson's room.

269
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,606
I'm gonna go peek on 'em and check,

270
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:10,110
but how hilarious, three (laughs)

271
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,193
three people in that tiny little bed.

272
00:11:24,425 --> 00:11:28,342
- I know, one sec.
- [Jared] So, was that comfy?

273
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:34,444
(laughs) Good morning.

274
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,647
- I think it's hilarious that you

275
00:11:35,647 --> 00:11:39,227
have a green dot on your head from Calvin.

276
00:11:39,227 --> 00:11:42,502
Thank you guys so much, it's right there,

277
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,089
right there, the green dot.
- Right there.

278
00:11:44,089 --> 00:11:45,342
- And thank you guys so much for

279
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:46,968
watching us painting pumpkins.

280
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:48,275
Thank you so much, Hannah, for

281
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,938
watching today's video, and I'm gonna go

282
00:11:50,938 --> 00:11:53,012
get in the hot tub with some of our

283
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,812
neighborhood friends, so ...

284
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:55,977
- Have fun.
- The girls.

285
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,024
- The ladies' night.
- The ladies.

286
00:11:57,024 --> 00:11:58,436
♫ Ladies' night
- Have fun.

287
00:11:58,436 --> 00:12:00,253
I will, me and Boomer are gonna have soda

288
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,851
in my office and we're
gonna edit the video.

289
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:02,886
It's gonna be great.

290
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:04,077
- [Ellie] Penny, you don't wanna come?

291
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:06,565
You don't wanna come?
Bye!

292
00:12:06,565 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thanks for watching, bye!
