1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:01,778
- Today is December 1st.
(bright music)

2
00:00:01,778 --> 00:00:03,711
- It snowed a lot.

3
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:04,570
- Bye poo.

4
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,299
- I have the completed version

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,258
of our first children's book.

6
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:10,389
- Eww.
- Oh.

7
00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:12,338
(laughing)

8
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:14,371
(laugh-wheezing)

9
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:16,887
- Oh my goodness Jackson.

10
00:00:16,887 --> 00:00:18,583
Look outside.

11
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,826
Penny you're so excited.

12
00:00:20,826 --> 00:00:22,322
- It snowed a lot.

13
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:24,683
- [Jared] It snowed.

14
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:27,515
It's just a little little little bit

15
00:00:27,515 --> 00:00:29,236
and it's melted on the sidewalk

16
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:32,040
and the grass, but look.

17
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,257
It snowed.

18
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:35,489
It's the first snow of the season.

19
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,156
Is that so cool?

20
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:39,222
We have snoooow.

21
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:40,502
But it'll probably be gone today,

22
00:00:40,502 --> 00:00:42,934
but at least we have it noooow.

23
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,914
Should we go make a little snowman?

24
00:00:44,914 --> 00:00:45,747
Okay.

25
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:46,741
- A tiny snowman.

26
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,311
- [Jared] A tiny snowman?

27
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:49,388
Yeah.

28
00:00:49,388 --> 00:00:50,724
- Happy December 1st.

29
00:00:50,724 --> 00:00:52,407
- What the heck?

30
00:00:52,407 --> 00:00:53,499
- Come sit down and I'll tell you.

31
00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:55,442
Today is December 1st

32
00:00:55,442 --> 00:00:59,192
and we don't have a lot
of family traditions.

33
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:01,778
Our kids are still young.

34
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:02,982
We're learning year by year
- What the heck is this?

35
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:04,156
- kind of what we want to do,

36
00:01:04,156 --> 00:01:05,795
what we like to do.

37
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:07,585
The kids are at perfect ages
- What the heck?

38
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:10,200
to start some traditions.
- What the heck is this?

39
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,475
- We've never really done this,

40
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:13,874
but this is an advent calendar.

41
00:01:13,874 --> 00:01:16,115
And usually they are with chocolates,

42
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:19,994
and I really didn't want to
do chocolate advent calendars,

43
00:01:19,994 --> 00:01:22,227
and I saw these cute Paw Patrol ones,

44
00:01:22,227 --> 00:01:25,284
and I thought that the kids
would really like them.

45
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:27,124
An advent calender, look.

46
00:01:27,124 --> 00:01:29,668
So what we do is every morning

47
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:31,203
after we eat breakfast,

48
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:34,399
this is a countdown to Christmas.

49
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,132
Ooh, don't push 'em all, 'cause look,

50
00:01:36,132 --> 00:01:37,747
what number is that?

51
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:38,733
- [Jackson] One one.

52
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,781
- [Ellie] It's 11.

53
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:40,614
- [Jackson] 11.

54
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:44,781
- [Ellie ] So we push this,
so one, all the way to 24

55
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:46,632
for Christmas Eve.

56
00:01:46,632 --> 00:01:50,097
So today, we're gonna
open just number one okay?

57
00:01:50,097 --> 00:01:51,242
- Okay.

58
00:01:51,242 --> 00:01:53,326
- [Ellie] Do you want
to push number one in?

59
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:54,159
- Yeah.

60
00:01:58,237 --> 00:02:00,487
(punching)

61
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,536
- [Ellie] Should we open him up?

62
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:05,369
- Yeah.

63
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:08,008
- Whoa.

64
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,677
- [Jackson] We have the same.

65
00:02:10,678 --> 00:02:13,404
- [Ellie] So every day, when
we're counting down the days

66
00:02:13,404 --> 00:02:16,621
until Christmas, we are
gonna open up one of those

67
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:19,256
and you'll have a little
special prize in there.

68
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:23,423
And look, he can play on his
little play area right there.

69
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:27,873
- I'm gonna eat all of the candy canes.

70
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,143
I'm gonna play in the water.

71
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:33,595
Please?

72
00:02:33,595 --> 00:02:35,285
- Yeah.
- Please Mama?

73
00:02:35,285 --> 00:02:36,118
- Yay!

74
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,649
- [Calvin] No.

75
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,492
- I'm floating in the water.

76
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:43,948
- So that's something that I want to do

77
00:02:43,948 --> 00:02:47,139
is every year have some
sort of advent calendar.

78
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,665
I've even seen a lot that
you can make your own

79
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:52,663
and it can be really
special and about Christ.

80
00:02:52,663 --> 00:02:54,238
I really would love to do that.

81
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:56,384
This year, I saw 'em and I grabbed 'em

82
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,702
and that's what we're doing this year.

83
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:59,606
But something else that
I really want to do

84
00:02:59,606 --> 00:03:02,125
is read a lot more Christmas
books with the kids.

85
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,542
So we got My First Christmas,

86
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,592
and we're gonna read this

87
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:10,092
and it talks all about Jesus and his story

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,480
and so we're gonna do that.

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,584
I thought this would be really fun,

90
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:18,221
especially for church after quiet time.

91
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:20,388
What kind of book is this?

92
00:03:21,291 --> 00:03:22,219
- Christmas.

93
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:23,052
- [Ellie] It's a Christmas book

94
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,767
and you find these pictures in the book,

95
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:28,336
so we can sit and stare
at the picture, like this,

96
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:31,665
light, can you see this light
in the picture somewhere?

97
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,505
Can we find it?

98
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,338
It's right there,

99
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,937
and it's telling you to
find it in the picture.

100
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:37,681
Can you see the lantern?

101
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:38,824
Perfect.

102
00:03:38,824 --> 00:03:40,553
So we're gonna do this a lot this month.

103
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,808
We're gonna look through all the pages,

104
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:44,992
on snowy days, hopefully.

105
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,227
- I'm gonna build a tiny snowman.

106
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,970
- I know we need to make
one if it snows more.

107
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,417
It's actually a really warm November.

108
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,753
It's been a really warm
November and December.

109
00:03:55,753 --> 00:03:57,121
And then last but not least,

110
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,018
I really wanted to do this as well,

111
00:03:59,018 --> 00:04:00,265
so I wanted to read more books,

112
00:04:00,265 --> 00:04:01,873
have an advent calendar,

113
00:04:01,873 --> 00:04:04,164
and then of course the
festivities that we do.

114
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:06,106
But I did see this as well,

115
00:04:06,106 --> 00:04:07,512
and I thought that this was really fun.

116
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:10,097
It's a little Christmas book,

117
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:12,264
and at the end of every night,

118
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:13,433
we'll read this for bed

119
00:04:13,433 --> 00:04:15,385
and it has things for you to do,

120
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:18,135
whether it's service, scriptures,

121
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,088
there's tons of scriptures,

122
00:04:21,088 --> 00:04:23,274
and so when we do that, we'll show you

123
00:04:23,274 --> 00:04:24,107
when we do that.

124
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:26,690
(lively music)

125
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:39,721
Let's try again,

126
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:42,138
and we'll come back and play.

127
00:04:43,168 --> 00:04:44,501
Let's try again.

128
00:04:45,372 --> 00:04:46,623
- Bye poo.

129
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:47,540
Look at me.

130
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:51,259
(lively music)

131
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,163
- [Jared] Oh Calvin.

132
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,548
Smile you're on camera,

133
00:05:05,548 --> 00:05:07,872
Calvin's been filming for
the past five minutes.

134
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:09,642
(Jared laughing)

135
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:10,475
- Calvin.

136
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,042
- [Jared] Calvin, you set the camera up.

137
00:05:12,042 --> 00:05:13,079
It was fun seeing you guys.

138
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:13,912
Thanks for stopping by.

139
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:15,626
- We'll see you on the trail.
- Bye.

140
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:16,570
- [Jared] Bye, oh yeah, you've got

141
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,704
your four-wheeler out there, huh?

142
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:20,258
- Yep, yep.
- Okay, drive safe guys.

143
00:05:20,258 --> 00:05:21,943
- I love you baby.
- Aww.

144
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:24,514
- A few of our cousins just got here

145
00:05:24,514 --> 00:05:28,074
and Jackson has been
out on the Segway, guys.

146
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,892
He has been riding the Segway.

147
00:05:30,892 --> 00:05:35,059
I am so proud of you bud.
(upbeat music)

148
00:05:40,986 --> 00:05:43,066
Is that hard work?

149
00:05:43,066 --> 00:05:44,113
- It's hard to turn.

150
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:45,247
- [Ellie] It is kinda hard to turn,

151
00:05:45,247 --> 00:05:48,871
but you turn it with this, so get on.

152
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:50,934
You've got to turn it with your arms.

153
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:51,767
Yep.

154
00:05:54,136 --> 00:05:54,969
Wow.

155
00:05:57,414 --> 00:05:59,437
You're doing good.

156
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:01,709
You just got on it and wanted to ride.

157
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,173
Poop patrol.

158
00:06:03,173 --> 00:06:04,173
Poop patrol!

159
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,304
- Clean the poop!

160
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:10,225
- [Ellie] Good job.

161
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,808
(upbeat music)

162
00:06:15,874 --> 00:06:17,154
- So I just got back from taking Penny

163
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:19,025
on this glorious walk,

164
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,017
and I pull in to the garage

165
00:06:21,017 --> 00:06:22,856
and I notice there's
three girls in my garage

166
00:06:22,856 --> 00:06:24,760
and they're all surrounding one person

167
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,184
and I'm like what the
heck is possibly going on,

168
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:29,019
like what are these girls doing.

169
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,835
Sure enough, they part ways,

170
00:06:30,835 --> 00:06:32,299
and it's this guy right here.

171
00:06:32,299 --> 00:06:33,132
- Hey!

172
00:06:33,982 --> 00:06:35,124
- So Landon and Julie are here,

173
00:06:35,124 --> 00:06:37,308
and they just did haircuts
in our garage, so.

174
00:06:37,308 --> 00:06:38,942
(laughs)

175
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:40,389
That's embarrassing I'm sorry.

176
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:41,344
Too inappropriate, right Jared?

177
00:06:41,344 --> 00:06:43,504
- [Ellie] Are you guys watching a show?

178
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:44,337
- Yeah.

179
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,170
- We're watching Boss Baby.

180
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,412
- [Ellie] How many kids do we got in here?

181
00:06:47,412 --> 00:06:48,245
- [Child] We got five,

182
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:49,684
Decorated this cute thing today.

183
00:06:49,684 --> 00:06:51,504
- [Child] One two three four--

184
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:52,978
(Ellie laughs)

185
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:55,847
- We just finished up
with dinner and Emma,

186
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:59,363
hi, Emma just came up to me
and goes I found this money

187
00:06:59,363 --> 00:07:00,746
downstairs, here you go.

188
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:02,330
And I was like, you're so honest,

189
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,802
you keep it and put it in your piggy bank.

190
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:04,766
And she's so happy about that.

191
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,871
- Well she goes, can I still put my tooth

192
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:08,592
under my pillow and get more money

193
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:09,425
from the tooth fairy?

194
00:07:09,425 --> 00:07:11,466
- Well she told me,
she's like, no it's okay,

195
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:13,333
I'm like what kid says no to
money in their piggy bank?

196
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,960
She's like I'm gonna put
my tooth under my pillow,

197
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,285
and I'm like, you can have this too.

198
00:07:17,285 --> 00:07:18,153
- Cute, well it was a two dollar bill,

199
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,012
are like special dollar bills.

200
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:21,883
(laughing)

201
00:07:21,883 --> 00:07:23,722
- Bonnie just finished making dinner.

202
00:07:23,722 --> 00:07:25,122
We all just ate.

203
00:07:25,122 --> 00:07:26,601
It's been really good.

204
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:29,981
Julie made this pizza, cookie pizza,

205
00:07:29,981 --> 00:07:31,397
which is so good,

206
00:07:31,397 --> 00:07:34,013
and then Bonnie made broccoli cheese soup.

207
00:07:34,013 --> 00:07:34,846
So good.
- Bye buddy,

208
00:07:34,846 --> 00:07:35,813

209
00:07:35,813 --> 00:07:36,646
- Okay.

210
00:07:36,646 --> 00:07:37,507
Bye Olivia, have fun at the party, okay?

211
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,445
- [Ellie] Hey Code, Cody.

212
00:07:39,445 --> 00:07:41,734
Maybe tomorrow, we can
get your football okay?

213
00:07:41,734 --> 00:07:42,885
- [Jared] Does that sound good?

214
00:07:42,885 --> 00:07:44,899
- Tomorrow's my friend's birthday.

215
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:46,113
- [Jared] We'll figure out a time frame.

216
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:48,160
- [Ellie] Maybe before or after, okay?

217
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,015
- Okay.

218
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,652
- Okay, we are gonna get him a ball,

219
00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:51,880
because Penny popped his

220
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,552
- at Thanksgiving.
- I felt so bad.

221
00:07:53,552 --> 00:07:54,915
- That's okay.
- We'll get him a good one.

222
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:56,292
- There were lots of balls to play with

223
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,376
and that one was just
extra soft and it popped.

224
00:07:58,376 --> 00:08:00,440
- Alright children gather 'round,

225
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,085
I have some very exciting news,

226
00:08:02,085 --> 00:08:05,391
some exciting announcements to make.

227
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:07,308
May I sit in the chair?

228
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:12,186
In my hand, I have something very cool.

229
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:14,041
I have the completed version

230
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,929
of our first children's book.

231
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,230
We wrote a book for you Emma

232
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,734
and for you Jackson and for you Calvin

233
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,846
and for you and your kids.

234
00:08:23,846 --> 00:08:26,756
It's our very first Pretty Penny book.

235
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,589
- It is.

236
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:28,944
I can't wait to hear it.

237
00:08:28,944 --> 00:08:30,232
- It's so cute.

238
00:08:30,232 --> 00:08:32,149
The artwork is amazing.

239
00:08:33,087 --> 00:08:34,306
Should we show 'em a sneak peak?

240
00:08:34,307 --> 00:08:35,140
- Totally.
- Okay.

241
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,873
- I feel so privilege to be like--

242
00:08:36,873 --> 00:08:37,706

00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:39,313
(laughing)

244
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:40,338
- To be one of the first

245
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:41,339
to hear this book.

246
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,933
- Thanks well I haven't heard all of it.

247
00:08:42,933 --> 00:08:44,846
- You haven't?

248
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:46,940
- [Jared] I think the
artwork is my favorite,

249
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,413
like look how beautiful that is.

250
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:50,901
It's so fun.

251
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:52,164
Are you ready to read it Emma?

252
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:52,997
- Yeah.

253
00:08:52,997 --> 00:08:53,830
- Okay, let me read it to you.

254
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,663
Let's get all the kids in here,

255
00:08:54,663 --> 00:08:55,817
this is exciting.

256
00:08:55,817 --> 00:08:56,929
Our first book and I'm gonna read it

257
00:08:56,929 --> 00:08:58,722
to all these kids.

258
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:01,305
(gentle music)

259
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,576
We are sitting here at our house.

260
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,712
The kids are all asleep right now.

261
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:18,551
And you know what we're talking about?

262
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:19,711
We're talking about babies.

263
00:09:19,711 --> 00:09:21,071
That's what we're talking about, kids.

264
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:22,344
- While our kids are asleep.

265
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:23,895
- Yeah.
- Babies.

266
00:09:23,895 --> 00:09:26,315
- But Julie and Ellie are both pregnant.

267
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,240
We've been talking about what we think

268
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,896
that they're going to have.

269
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:33,200
My brother Matt has three boys

270
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
and they're having a girl now,

271
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,600
congratulations Matt and Emily.

272
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,881
Our sister in law Emily, she doesn't know

273
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:40,144
what she's having yet.

274
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:41,609
- I don't think she's gonna find out.

275
00:09:41,609 --> 00:09:43,614
- Yeah, and you guys don't know what,

276
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:45,274
but we're just talking about,

277
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:47,074
what if it's a boy, what if it's a girl.

278
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,005
I don't know, it's just
kind of fun to think about,

279
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,428
and fun to imagine life with a girl

280
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:56,000
and fun to imagine life with another boy,

281
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,368
like how the relationships of our kids

282
00:09:58,368 --> 00:10:00,187
are going to be affected by that.

283
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,120
Like if we have a girl,

284
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,894
how are Calvin and Jackson going to react

285
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:05,627
to a girl versus a boy?

286
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:07,950
You know, it's just fun
to think about that stuff.

287
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,617
Would you look at the
size of these cookies.

288
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,714
- Are you talking about me?

289
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,547
(Jared laughing)

290
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,724
- [Julie] It's warm still.

291
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,407
- This is the best treat ever.
- Oh yeah.

292
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,599
- [Jared] The cookies or yours?

293
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:19,491
- Mine (laughs).

294
00:10:19,491 --> 00:10:20,324
- [Bonnie] My cookies?

295
00:10:20,324 --> 00:10:22,179
- [Jared] It's like yogurt,
you want your cookies?

296
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:23,943
These are ginormous.

297
00:10:23,943 --> 00:10:25,199
- [Julie] They're like
the size of my hand.

298
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,297
- [Jared] I know, and they're
still warm to the touch.

299
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:29,200
Feel these cookies.

300
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,332
- Oh.
(laughing)

301
00:10:30,332 --> 00:10:32,387
- [Jared] Take a bite of this cookie.

302
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:34,301
(Jared laughing)

303
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,092
- You're welcome for
the zit in the morning.

304
00:10:36,092 --> 00:10:37,175
- [Jared] Oh.

305
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,428
(laughing)

306
00:10:44,662 --> 00:10:45,495
- Okay.

307
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:47,707
- Eww.
- Oh.

308
00:10:47,707 --> 00:10:49,672
(laughing)

309
00:10:49,672 --> 00:10:52,422
(laugh-wheezing)

310
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,157
(laughing)

311
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,960
- Oh that's disgusting.

312
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,043
How are we so disgusting?

313
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,826
- [Jared] Bonnie has moved
past the laughing stage

314
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:07,318
and is now in the wheezing stage.

315
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:08,946
- Okay okay don't laugh.

316
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:09,995
- [Jared] What's the
goal of this right here?

317
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,130
- This is, okay we're gonna--

318
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,722
- Just because we're proud
of how hideous we are.

319
00:11:14,722 --> 00:11:16,155
- [Jared] The double chin, is that what--

320
00:11:16,155 --> 00:11:18,322
- Yeah it's intense, okay?

321
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:20,527
- I am not doing that.

322
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:21,947
- [Ellie] They totally need
to put their jaws under.

323
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,410
- [Jared] (laughing) That
was a good prep Julie,

324
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:25,968
that was like a wind up.

325
00:11:25,968 --> 00:11:28,991
(laughing)

326
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:31,317
- I think there's more skin under there.

327
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,567
- [Jared] Gather it all up.

328
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:37,604
(laughing)

329
00:11:37,604 --> 00:11:38,590
- Oh this is bad.

330
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,995
- What entertains it on
a Friday night, right?

331
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:44,327
Cookies, pizza bites and double chins.

332
00:11:44,327 --> 00:11:45,686
(Jared laughs)

333
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,019
- Here, let's just do it again.

334
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:47,852
- I want to see yours.

335
00:11:47,852 --> 00:11:49,026
I think we'll get one.

336
00:11:49,026 --> 00:11:50,123
- [Jared] Triple threat.

337
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,002
- Okay.
- Alright.

338
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,835
- [Jared] This is the thumbnail,

339
00:11:52,835 --> 00:11:53,668
make it good.

340
00:11:53,668 --> 00:11:54,697
- Oh stop.

341
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:56,374
- [Jared] Everyone do the wind up on

342
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:57,541
one two three.

343
00:11:58,888 --> 00:00:00,000
(Jared laughing)
