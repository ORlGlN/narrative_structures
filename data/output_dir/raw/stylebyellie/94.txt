1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,771
- We have a special delivery.

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:02,604
- [Jared] Oh, my gosh!

3
00:00:02,604 --> 00:00:05,652
- And it's not Costa Vida salad.

4
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:06,485
- Are you ready?

5
00:00:06,485 --> 00:00:08,010
Oh, my gosh, this is so exciting.

6
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,540
I can't believe we're finally getting 'em.

7
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,550
- My mom's gonna watch
this and roll her eyes

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,240
'cause she's like, "I was sick first."

9
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,100
- [Jared] Hey, do you wanna
read it to Penny again?

10
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,933
Okay.

11
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:21,700
(Calvin mumbles)

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,738
- [Ellie] Sing to it.

13
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:24,736
♪ La la la la ♪

14
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:25,590
- [Calvin] Mommy, mommy.

15
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,450
- We are singing Christmas music.

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,030
What's up?

17
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,500
Oh, my gosh. (laughs)

18
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,370
Yes, you just witnessed that.

19
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,870
He goes, "Mama," and came and hugged me.

20
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,940
Jackson, can you help me?

21
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,390
Come here.

22
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,600
I just got back from the salon, guys.

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,490
My friend just touched up my roots,

24
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:47,370
and she trimmed my hair a little bit.

25
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,800
So I feel very fresh.

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,100
I came home and we had
sprinkles galore over here

27
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,050
with gingerbread houses.

28
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,510
So I cleaned up, but I have two friends,

29
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:57,550
so Jared and I wanted to
do neighborhood gifts,

30
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,470
but I have two special friends in the area

31
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,942
that have been so unbelievably good to me.

32
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:05,730
Remember that flower over there

33
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,990
that I've showed you
guys a bajillion times?

34
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,540
She gave this to me in
May, and I still like,

35
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,210
everyday, I look at it, everyday.

36
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,210
And I just think what a thoughtful gift.

37
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,870
My friend gave me that,
and then my other friend,

38
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,880
I work with her at church
with the activity days girls.

39
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,500
And I swear, she came into my life

40
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,800
during a really hard time.

41
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,820
It was like after my first miscarriage.

42
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,970
And like with all the church stuff,

43
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,570
I like didn't do anything.

44
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,990
I put it all on her, and I was like,

45
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,790
"I'm not functioning right now.

46
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,623
"I'm not gonna go.

47
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:37,040
"I'm not gonna do this right now.

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,240
"I want to, but I just don't
have the energy right now."

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,100
And I put a lot of work on
her, and she was so good to me

50
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,880
and totally lifted me up when I needed it.

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,470
And so when I was at the
salon, they had a bunch

52
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,390
of bath bombs, so I got
each of them a bath bomb.

53
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:56,630
And I got them a little mini
shampoo and conditioner.

54
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,850
This is Bumble and bumble.

55
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,530
It's really good stuff that I like.

56
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,390
So I thought giving
them just a little extra

57
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,540
special gift to tell them how much

58
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,850
I appreciate their
friendship would be fun.

59
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,683
And so,

60
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:08,080
Jackson, sorry, I asked
you to come over here

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,000
and then I ignored you.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,833
Come here.

63
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:13,093
Do you guys wanna help
me put them in the bags?

64
00:02:13,093 --> 00:02:13,926
- [Jackson] Yeah.

65
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:14,867
- [Ellie] Okay, you can open up these.

66
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:15,950
- [Jackson] They're bath bombs?

67
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,783
- [Ellie] Yeah.

68
00:02:16,783 --> 00:02:19,640
- [Jackson] I want to put this one in.

69
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,120
- [Ellie] Okay, you can open
these bags and put them in it.

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,740
Calvin, do you wanna open one.

71
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,573
- [Calvin] Mm-hmm.

72
00:02:25,573 --> 00:02:26,500
- Okay, open that up.

73
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,030
So I got them some bath bombs.

74
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,490
And my mom and dad have seriously been hit

75
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:35,150
with a really bad cold right now.

76
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,020
And they had, oh, they smell so good.

77
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,840
They're called Breathe bath bombs.

78
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,540
So I guess there's this lady in my town

79
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,470
that makes all these bath bombs,

80
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:48,970
and you guys all know, I
mean any bath bomb, I love.

81
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,790
So I'm excited to try these.

82
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,623
Perfect.

83
00:02:51,623 --> 00:02:54,280
Put your hand in there
and stretch that out.

84
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,430
Yup, a little, push it, push it.

85
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,510
Yup, perfect.

86
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,210
Put the bath bomb in there.

87
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,130
And then, let's see, the
gentle shampoo conditioner,

88
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,410
put this one together and put it in here.

89
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,700
And then Calvin, can
you put those in there?

90
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,630
So my parents have been sick,

91
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,060
so I got them some of
those Breathe bath bombs.

92
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,370
And I think tomorrow, I'm gonna
go down and give it to 'em

93
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,570
because my dad has been super sick.

94
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,096
My mom's gonna watch
this and roll her eyes

95
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:22,221
because she's like, "I was sick first."

96
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:25,770
My mom has been really sick,
and then my dad caught it.

97
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,730
And now it's like the world
has ended in their home

98
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:31,480
because dad has a man cold
that's really, really bad.

99
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,000
But I'm gonna go give them
some of those tomorrow.

100
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,445
Can you guys help me
deliver these to my friends?

101
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:38,278
- [Jackson] Mm-hmm.

102
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:39,710
- [Ellie] Okay, I'm gonna
write them a little note

103
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,270
and then you can ring their
doorbell and give it to them.

104
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,280
Sound good?

105
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,113
- Yeah.

106
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:45,690
- [Ellie] Are you guys ready?

107
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,180
Ready to rumble?

108
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,120
Okay.

109
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,490
Daddy, are you ready?

110
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,990
Ready to rumble?

111
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,050
- [Jared] Ready to rumble?

112
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,883
- [Jared] What's up?

113
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:54,716
Why are you contemplating

114
00:03:54,716 --> 00:03:55,840
while you're looking out your window?

115
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,190
- I'm looking out the
window because our books,

116
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,040
our first batch of books
are being delivered today.

117
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,461
So I kind of feel like I'm just like--

118
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:02,648
(Ellie laughs)

119
00:04:02,648 --> 00:04:04,730
- [Ellie] The Penny book!

120
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,708
- Yeah, they're gonna be here today.

121
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:06,960
I'm so excited.
- Yay!

122
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,230
Jared's children's book is gonna be here.

123
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,649
I'm really excited, Ellie.

124
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,030
I'm really excited.

125
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,863
Whoa!

126
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:13,696
- [Ellie] I hope everyone loves it.

127
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,529
- Yeah.

128
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,362
And if it gets here today,

129
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:17,272
maybe we'll give you like a
sneak peek of the whole thing.

130
00:04:17,272 --> 00:04:18,750
- [Ellie] Totally!

131
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,190
- I'm mostly excited,

132
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,600
this is a project that my
dad and I worked on together.

133
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,360
I'm mostly excited to have him hold it.

134
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,890
And that's the thing.

135
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,438
It's like when you create something,

136
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:31,720
everything we do, almost
everything we do is digital,

137
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,460
with the exception of like this stuff.

138
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,330
And having something physical
that I can hold on to

139
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,100
and say like, "We made
this," like that's special.

140
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,933
- [Ellie] So fun.

141
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:40,794
- And that's cool.

142
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,010
And so I'm like so excited.

143
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:45,030
The UPS guy usually gets here
around three, and it's like

144
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,790
not even close to that.
- Tick tock.

145
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,623
I forgot to tell you guys.

146
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:49,040
Guess what.

147
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,410
My friend that does my hair,

148
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,561
she gave you guys a Christmas gift.

149
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,740
She knew how much you
guys liked bath bombs.

150
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,450
She gave you each your very own.

151
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,860
Don't put it in that one
because we're gonna give that

152
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,200
to our friend, but
we'll keep this at home.

153
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,350
You can put it back, and tonight,

154
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,723
when we take a bath, you can use that.

155
00:05:10,723 --> 00:05:11,556
- [Jackson] These?

156
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:12,389
- [Ellie] Yeah.

157
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:13,630
- These blue bath bombs?

158
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,463
- Yeah.

159
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:16,540
Seriously, the kids love bath bombs.

160
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,750
If I have ones, I have to hide 'em

161
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,600
because they're like, "But
I see it and I want it."

162
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,180
So that was cute of her, so nice of her.

163
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,140
The other day, when we went to that play

164
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,140
and a lot of the vloggers
were there, Carly was there.

165
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,466
And I was talking to her about
like the holidays and stuff.

166
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:37,210
And she just Instagrammed that
she has split up the weekends

167
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,290
in December to be with
both sides of the family.

168
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,030
And that way, on Christmas Day,

169
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:42,760
it's just her and her family.

170
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,440
And I had seen a comment
on there that someone said,

171
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,750
"How do you make this decision?

172
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,240
"I get so many people
that are upset with me."

173
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,330
And Jared and I have
made that decision too.

174
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,980
When we very first got married,

175
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:56,070
we were waiting for the
first family (mumbles)

176
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,510
and they just pulled up.

177
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,530
Jared and I did that years ago.

178
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:02,380
Our very first Christmas, we
spent it with Jared's family.

179
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,810
The second Christmas we were married,

180
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,950
we spent it with my family.

181
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,210
And then ever since
then, on Christmas Day,

182
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,230
we've spent it just with us two.

183
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:12,270
And now that we have our
kids, it's us and the kids.

184
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,160
And I really like it
because it leaves, I think,

185
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,500
I feel awkward right now.

186
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,430
- Oh, don't feel awkward.

187
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,350
It's okay.

188
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,790
It's nice because like we were able

189
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,240
to like have those family things.

190
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,260
And we still have family things.

191
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,920
We just don't do it on Christmas Day.

192
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,753
- [Ellie] Yeah.

193
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,580
- Like we have a family
party with your family

194
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,100
a couple of days before
Christmas, and we do things

195
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,290
with my family a couple of
days before Christmas too.

196
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,300
So Christmas Day is our family.

197
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,240
- [Ellie] It really is fun to be home.

198
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:42,390
- Over there, over there,
over there. (mumbles)

199
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:48,643
Stack it next here.

200
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:49,740
Just stack them.

201
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,300
- We have a special delivery.

202
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,133
- [Jared] Oh, my gosh.

203
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:53,562
- And it's not Costa Vida salad.

204
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:54,994
- It's our box.

205
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:57,368
We got the boxes with
our books inside of them.

206
00:06:57,368 --> 00:06:58,650
I'm so excited.

207
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,470
I need a knife, stat.

208
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,180
- [Ellie] Okay, I'm watching, mister.

209
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,070
- Do you wanna open the box?

210
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,460
- No, you open the box.

211
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,430
- I'll open this one,
and you open this one.

212
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,090
- Okay, that's fair.

213
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,907
- [Ellie] It's like Christmas for you.

214
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:14,740
- Are you ready?

215
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:16,300
Oh, my gosh, this is so exciting.

216
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,840
I can't believe we're finally getting 'em.

217
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,820
This is so cool.

218
00:07:20,456 --> 00:07:21,289
- [Ellie] What?

219
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:23,206
- [Jared] Look at this.

220
00:07:24,086 --> 00:07:27,800
- [Ellie] This is your very own book!

221
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,230
- Pretty Penny and Her Very Best Friend.

222
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:32,970
- [Ellie] That is so cute.

223
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:37,854
And look how pretty Miss Pretty Penny is.

224
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:39,470
That's your book.

225
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,410
- [Jared] Calvin, look.

226
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,860
Do you like it?

227
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,693
Yeah?

228
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,980
Do you like it too, Nixon?

229
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,813
- [Ellie] Hi.

230
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:50,649
Hi, Jen.

231
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:51,900
- Hi.

232
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,733
- [Ellie] Jen's in town.

233
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:54,470
We're all gonna go to a movie.

234
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,040
Jared, this is cool.

235
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,570
Written by Jared Mecham
and J. Craig Mecham.

236
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,780
How cute.

237
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,180
- Penny was a pretty puppy.

238
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:10,890
She lived happily with her
very best friend, Henry,

239
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,350
in a place where the neighbors

240
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,520
would always call her Pretty Penny.

241
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,209
How awesome is this?

242
00:08:17,209 --> 00:08:20,070
I wanted to take a second
and talk a little bit more

243
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,870
about our book that we just got.

244
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm so excited about that,
but you already know that.

245
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,720
We want to make this available to you

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,190
as soon as we possibly can.

247
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:31,543
And we actually have the
ability to do it now,

248
00:08:31,543 --> 00:08:34,039
but there's more to it than that.

249
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,989
My dad and I have worked
really hard on this book,

250
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,289
and we wanna make it available

251
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,179
to as many people as we possibly can.

252
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:41,779
The way that we've gone through it

253
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,330
is a little bit more expensive
than we want it to be.

254
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,660
And so Ellie and I and my dad are looking

255
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,400
at different options in
terms of manufacturing

256
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,570
and development and printing
and shipping this book

257
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,600
so it's more affordable for you.

258
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,763
And so while we could make
it available right now,

259
00:08:59,763 --> 00:09:02,880
I think we're gonna postpone
it just a little bit.

260
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,460
And we're working as fast as
we can to make it available

261
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,460
as fast as possible, but
I think in the long run,

262
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,490
it's gonna be better for you
and for us to do it this way.

263
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:13,180
And it may take some
time, but we're looking

264
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,150
at all the different
venues because I think

265
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,800
we're just a little surprised by the cost

266
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,790
that this distributor is
wanting to charge for it.

267
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,176
So with that being said,

268
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:27,560
we have a few copies and everything.

269
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,820
This ultimately gives us
the opportunity for us

270
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,840
to do signed copies instead
of having it shipped

271
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,970
from somewhere that we don't know.

272
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,410
We know exactly where it's shipping from.

273
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,110
We can get some and sign it

274
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,830
and then have it shipped out is the plan.

275
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,060
We want to do some signed
copies for some of you guys.

276
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,360
So stay tuned for that.

277
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,090
In fact, what I'm probably
gonna do, here soon,

278
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:51,480
I'm gonna have a survey come
out to you where we ask you

279
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,700
questions about all of
these different things

280
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,130
about books, about signing,

281
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,780
about things that you
would like and so forth.

282
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,990
So I just wanted to be
candid and honest with you.

283
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,680
And I feel like this is
gonna be better for us,

284
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,370
and especially for you, lowering the cost,

285
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,010
making this available for everyone.

286
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,336
So thanks for your
patience and understanding.

287
00:10:10,336 --> 00:10:13,600
This will be available soon for you.

288
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,460
We wanted to make it
available for Christmas,

289
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,710
but it just didn't work out.

290
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,230
But it's gonna be coming
soon, and it's gonna be great.

291
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,930
You know when you taste something
for the very first time,

292
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,280
or you haven't had
anything sour in a while

293
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,231
and you eat something sour
and you're like (mumbles)

294
00:10:29,231 --> 00:10:32,260
it gets you, I think
Penny had that experience

295
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,350
for the very first time.

296
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,140
Ellie has her bath set
up, and Penny was in here,

297
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,930
is in here, and she saw this bath bomb.

298
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,890
And she tooK a little lick of it,

299
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,680
and these are all like natural
and they're okay to eat.

300
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,980
Oh!

301
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,670
And Penny licked it, and
she literally was like.

302
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,210
It was so funny.

303
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,510
And you just saw my tongue way too much,

304
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,540
so sorry about that.

305
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,760
I just had to be descriptive with it.

306
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,610
- [Ellie] It was the
funniest thing though.

307
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,770
- It was so funnY.

308
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,705
- [Ellie] It's not yours.

309
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:00,110
No, don't even, don't.

310
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,943
- Don't even.

311
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:01,898
- [Ellie] No, ah-ah.

312
00:11:01,898 --> 00:11:02,731
- Okay.

313
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:03,564
You have to take my word for it.

314
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:04,397
It was so funny.

315
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:05,530
She's like, "That was interesting.

316
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,363
"I wanna try it again."

317
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:07,726
- [Ellie] I think she would hate it.

318
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:10,200
(Jared laughs)

319
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
- Don't fall in the tub.

320
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,640
Okay, it's time for you to eat dinner.

321
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,473
Let's go eat dinner.

322
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,360
- [Ellie] He's showing her the book.

323
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,830
Don't be embarrassed.

324
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,380
Are you showing Penny the book?

325
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,840
Show her the book.

326
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,870
Oh, my gosh.

327
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,220
That's the cutest thing.

328
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,170
So it's late.

329
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:38,815
Jared and I are going over our videos.

330
00:11:38,815 --> 00:11:41,073
- That is the cutest thing I have ever--

331
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:44,490
- [Ellie] But he is showing her the book.

332
00:11:46,056 --> 00:11:47,200
- Poor Calvin.

333
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,640
- [Ellie] Calvin has an
ear infection for sure.

334
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,510
- Yeah, he's been like
having a hard time sleeping.

335
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,410
He came and sat down
with us and everything.

336
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,910
- And he has just been crying

337
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,760
and pulling and grabbing his ear.

338
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,250
- So he sat on the couch with us,

339
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,270
and he has been watching Peppa Pig.

340
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,390
And I have our Penny book

341
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,830
that was delivered today right here.

342
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,997
And he looked at it and
grabbed it, looked at the book,

343
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,440
and then just walked right over to Penny.

344
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,300
- [Ellie] And he literally,
he has been crying.

345
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,130
Like he's been watching his
show, but he's been just crying.

346
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,460
Penny's in bed for the night.

347
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,430
He's opening the pages.

348
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,220
- [Jared] Here's a bedtime story, Penny.

349
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:37,970
Oh. (laughs)

350
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,520
- [Ellie] Oh, he's embarrassed.

351
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,360
- [Jared] Did you read Penny the book?

352
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,120
- [Ellie] Did she like it?

353
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,516
Okay.

354
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,910
- [Jared] Do you like it?

355
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,270
Do you like the Penny book?

356
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,818
Good.

357
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,220
Do you wanna look at the pictures?

358
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,020
Come on, let's look at the pictures.

359
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,730
Do you wanna read it to Penny again?

360
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,820
Okay.

361
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,690
- [Ellie] How adorable.

362
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,810
- He knows that's Penny on the book,

363
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,470
and he's reading it to Penny.

364
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,640
- [Ellie] That was really cute.

365
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,600
I think what's cute is
that his ear hurts so bad

366
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,782
and he's being tender.

367
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,040
- He's been really sweet
even though he's in pain.

368
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,873
It was so cute.

369
00:13:22,873 --> 00:13:24,560
Because we were talking to Calvin like,

370
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,485
"Does your ear hurt?"

371
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,405
And he said, "Yeah."

372
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:29,700
And Ellie said, "We'll go see
the doctor tomorrow morning,

373
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,120
"and we'll make sure that
he makes it all better."

374
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,534
And then he goes, "Okay, mom."

375
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:37,019
And I was just like.

376
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,150
Like so sweet.

377
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,983
- [Ellie] Yes.

378
00:13:38,983 --> 00:13:41,250
I didn't even see it coming.

379
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,640
He's had a little stuffy
nose but I didn't--

380
00:13:44,597 --> 00:13:45,430
- Poor guy.

381
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,450
So it has been four hours
since we put Calvin to bed,

382
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,620
and he is finally asleep.

383
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:56,820
(chuckles) Do you hear that snoring?

384
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,112
Of course, you do.

385
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,309
Sounds like a bear.

386
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,642
- I gotta go lay him in bed.

387
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:08,554
He has been pulling at his
ear all night going, "Owie."

388
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,430
- Yeah, we'll get him all taken care of.

389
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:20,130
I love my family.

390
00:14:20,130 --> 00:00:00,000
Good night, Calvin.
