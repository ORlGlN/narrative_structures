1
00:00:00,243 --> 00:00:01,076
- Baby?

2
00:00:01,076 --> 00:00:01,909
And point to my stomach

3
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:04,048
and I go, yeah, it's
the baby, he goes I see.

4
00:00:04,048 --> 00:00:05,534
(laughing)

5
00:00:05,534 --> 00:00:06,367
- [Jared] Boo.

6
00:00:06,367 --> 00:00:08,260
(Jared laughs)

7
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,510
(laughing)

8
00:00:11,696 --> 00:00:13,984
- I'm not gonna do what you want.

9
00:00:13,984 --> 00:00:15,474
(laughing)

10
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,961
So when I wake up, I
always brush my teeth,

11
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:21,396
especially before I do
my make-up and get ready,

12
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,803
because, and that's just kind of not fun,

13
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:26,439
if brush your teeth after you've like

14
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,327
gotten ready for the day, you know?

15
00:00:28,327 --> 00:00:30,599
So I went to go brush my teeth today,

16
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,841
but I've been dry heaving a lot

17
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:35,991
and so, I'm just gonna
have to brush it later.

18
00:00:35,991 --> 00:00:37,198
And I put a piece of candy in my mouth

19
00:00:37,198 --> 00:00:41,794
because I think my stomach
is just really upset,

20
00:00:41,794 --> 00:00:44,186
and this, I don't even
know what else to say

21
00:00:44,186 --> 00:00:46,603
other than that, I just feel,

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,673
I just need to get ready.

23
00:00:49,673 --> 00:00:51,202
I always feel better when I get ready.

24
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:52,937
Like I don't want to get ready,

25
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,937
but I feel like if I do,

26
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:59,370
it'll give me that kick
and push for the day.

27
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,872
I have my mom's grandma's silverware,

28
00:01:01,872 --> 00:01:05,622
cinnamon sticks, and
mom said to grab cloves.

29
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:09,913
I think that's like all I have.

30
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:11,522
Okay, we are getting ready

31
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:14,314
to take a few more
pictures for our cookbook

32
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:15,147
this morning.

33
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:15,993
I'm heading over the Bonnie's.

34
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:18,234
It's just like a few small things

35
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:20,979
of what you can eat around the holidays.

36
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,538
So here we go.

37
00:01:22,538 --> 00:01:23,810
I just touched the Christmas tree

38
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,226
and Lincoln goes, don't touch it!

39
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,226
(gasps)

40
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:32,660
Your mama's looking.

41
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,596
(laughing)

42
00:01:34,596 --> 00:01:37,741
You've been trained, huh,
not to touch the tree.

43
00:01:37,741 --> 00:01:38,809
That was so funny.

44
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,377
I literally was over here
looking at ornaments,

45
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:42,736
he's like don't touch it.

46
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,236
- That's some cow.

47
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:47,766
(laughing)

48
00:01:52,772 --> 00:01:56,189
- [Ellie] Got that in the oven, bean dip.

49
00:01:57,692 --> 00:02:01,442
Brownies, soup, wassail,
brittle and popcorn.

50
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:03,885
- I just--

51
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:04,718
- Are you waiting for me to move?

52
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:05,963
- No I was trying to hit the record button

53
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:07,467
as fast as I could

54
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:09,304
and I was gonna be like bink.

55
00:02:09,304 --> 00:02:10,205
(laughing)

56
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,529
But your bum got out of the way.

57
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:13,419
Oh here, freeze,

58
00:02:13,419 --> 00:02:14,252
bing.

59
00:02:14,252 --> 00:02:16,981
(laughing)

60
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,445
I feel like we need a
little laughter after--

61
00:02:18,445 --> 00:02:19,792
- [Bonnie] We do need a little laughter.

62
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:22,215
- after this weekend has been so crazy.

63
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:23,912
Just with this whole situation

64
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,335
that Bonnie has been going through.

65
00:02:26,335 --> 00:02:27,798
You guys probably saw her video

66
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,831
about the demonetization.

67
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,461
and we've like literally been working

68
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:33,144
around the clock trying
to figure this out,

69
00:02:33,144 --> 00:02:34,625
and figure out what we need to do,

70
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,139
and like Bonnie and Joel said,

71
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:38,011
we support YouTube cleaning up their--

72
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,161
- Absolutely.

73
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,049
- Their videos and everything,

74
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,624
but we've just been working hard at this

75
00:02:41,624 --> 00:02:44,211
and now our brains are
ready for a little break

76
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:45,597
and laughter, like that.

77
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:47,431
- It was nice having you guys over here.

78
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,971
- I'm not laughing at you
flicking my wife's bum.

79
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:50,219
- Yeah.

80
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,674
- Oh sorry, I didn't even
see you there Joel, uhhh.

81
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,258
We also have some chips and dip

82
00:02:56,258 --> 00:02:57,859
and some bananas and yogurt,

83
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:02,078
so the snacks are in a plenty
at Bonnie and Joel's house,

84
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:03,622
but we're done for the day

85
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:05,358
so time to go.

86
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,641
Thanks guys.
- Yeah, please leave.

87
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,642
- Quickly, just kidding.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

88
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:10,439
- It's funny, the one time I don't have

89
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:12,476
my Apple watch on is
the time when I'm like

90
00:03:12,476 --> 00:03:14,465
oh man, I really wish I
had it for this thing,

91
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,633
but then I don't need it for this thing,

92
00:03:16,633 --> 00:03:18,640
because I can just do it,
I'm doing it right now.

93
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,667
There's a breathe app, on the Apple watch,

94
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,731
where it reminds you to just sit back

95
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,875
and just take one minute and breathe

96
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,235
and focus on your breath.

97
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,528
(squeaking toy)

98
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,064
And I feel like today,
this weekend especially,

99
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:35,453
I've just needed to take
a minute and breathe.

100
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,093
So I'm outside with Penny

101
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,917
and we're having fun
throwing the ball around.

102
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,205
And I'm just looking over
the beautiful sunset,

103
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:42,867
like holy cow, does that
look like it's straight

104
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:45,900
out of a Bob Ross painting or what?

105
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,157
And I'm just out here,

106
00:03:48,157 --> 00:03:49,589
breathing in the nice
(squeaking toy)

107
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:53,354
cool crisp air, while Penny is squeaking.

108
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:54,866
(laughs)

109
00:03:54,866 --> 00:03:57,452
Talk about relaxing, right?

110
00:03:57,452 --> 00:03:59,010
But it's just, I need to remind myself

111
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,854
every once in awhile

112
00:03:59,854 --> 00:04:03,187
to just stop for one minute and breathe.

113
00:04:04,246 --> 00:04:05,717
Know that you can handle everything

114
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,750
that is coming your way,

115
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,220
that you just take
things one step at a time

116
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,434
and you can handle things.

117
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:14,538
Every day is a new day

118
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:15,970
and you can go through it,

119
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,257
just one step at a time,

120
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,007
one breath at a time.

121
00:04:20,002 --> 00:04:22,010
Write things down, cross 'em off the list

122
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,532
and you can do it, so,

123
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:25,346
I'm out here, and I'm gonna take a minute

124
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:29,775
and breathe with the squeaky
toy in the background.

125
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:31,710
Penny, you're crazy.

126
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:32,543
Okay.

127
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,115
Goose Rubba.

128
00:04:36,532 --> 00:04:38,615
(laughs)

129
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,707
(whispers) He's coming in right now.

130
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:46,400
Boo.

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,569
(Jared laughs)

132
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:49,402
Hi buddy.

133
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,512
How are you?
- Hi.

134
00:04:51,512 --> 00:04:52,345
- Good.

135
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:54,865
- I love you so much.

136
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:55,713
- I love you.

137
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:56,546
- Did I scare you a little bit?

138
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,385
- Yeah.

139
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:58,915
- Are you so happy to see me?

140
00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,748
- Yeah.

141
00:04:59,748 --> 00:05:01,046
- I'm so happy to see you.

142
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,221
- What are you doing?

143
00:05:02,221 --> 00:05:04,247
- I'm kneeling here on
the ground filming you

144
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:06,423
is what I'm doing.

145
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:09,173
- But what are you gonna do next?

146
00:05:11,263 --> 00:05:15,322
- I'm gonna give you a
big ole hug and kiss.

147
00:05:15,322 --> 00:05:16,431
(laughs)

148
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:17,774
- Now what next?

149
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:18,607
- Now what next?

150
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:19,440
Maybe we'll--

151
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,007
(whispers) Oh let's be so
quiet because Calvin is asleep.

152
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:23,135
Hi Calvin.

153
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:24,351
He's sleeping.

154
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,904
What should we do next?

155
00:05:25,904 --> 00:05:27,720
Should we slide on the ground?

156
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,600
- Yeah.

157
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,681
I'm gonna get my blanket.
- Okay.

158
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:31,691
- [Jared] Okay.

159
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:33,325
Let's go.
(twangy music)

160
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:34,981
- Where is it?

161
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,814
- [Jared] I think it's on our bed.

162
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,066
Okay, you got it?

163
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:40,899
- Yeah.

164
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:42,899
- [Jared] Okay, let's see your slide.

165
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:45,134
Okay, laying it out right there,

166
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:48,406
Oh and you go for the
wind up and everything?

167
00:05:48,406 --> 00:05:49,399
The running start,

168
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:51,566
on your mark, get set, go.

169
00:05:53,454 --> 00:05:54,821
(Jared laughs)

170
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,654
Go.

171
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,592
(Jared laughs)

172
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,759
Can Daddy try?

173
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,144
Does that hurt your bum?

174
00:06:08,144 --> 00:06:08,977
- Yeah.

175
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,124
- I'm glad you're home.

176
00:06:11,124 --> 00:06:12,484
I missed you so much.

177
00:06:12,484 --> 00:06:13,317
- Yeah.

178
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,015
(laughing)

179
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:17,873
- You have to be quiet,

180
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,647
Calvin's asleep, you have to be quiet.

181
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,983
You have to be quiet, Calvin's asleep.

182
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:25,880
- That tickles.

183
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,120
- [Jared] Look I'm sorry.

184
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,119
I'm so sorry.

185
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:30,144
- It's actually really late,

186
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,182
I should wake him up,

187
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,526
but he did not sleep last night.

188
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,937
- [Jared] No he didn't sleep
very good last night, huh?

189
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,603
All the sleep he can get is good.

190
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:39,436
- Yeah.

191
00:06:39,436 --> 00:06:40,913
- I'm gonna do something crazy.

192
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:42,797
I'm gonna attempt to
kiss him on the head--

193
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:43,630
- [Ellie] No.

194
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,630
- without waking him up.

195
00:06:48,021 --> 00:06:50,271
No I can't do it, no I can.

196
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:55,165
- This is giving every mom anxiety.

197
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,415
(laughing)

198
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:01,799
(footsteps)

199
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:04,095
- There's moments that live down

200
00:07:04,095 --> 00:07:05,543
in Ellie and Jared history

201
00:07:05,543 --> 00:07:08,119
and I think this is
one of them right here.

202
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:10,039
This is the intro to one of our videos

203
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,239
and I have to show it to you.

204
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:12,509
I have a question for you buckaroo.

205
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,738
- Yeah.

206
00:07:13,738 --> 00:07:16,546
- Are you ready for the day?

207
00:07:16,546 --> 00:07:18,138
- Yeah!

208
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:18,971
- [Jared] Yeah!

209
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:20,982
(Jared laughing)

210
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,750
That's just like my favorite--

211
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,960
- Motivational toddler.

212
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,966
- Yeah, motivational toddler,
that's my favorite thing.

213
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:30,640
Jackson was so, and still
is, so enthusiastic,

214
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,830
and I love it.

215
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,663
And there's one more thing,

216
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:34,551
Ellie shared it on her Instagram.

217
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:36,913
It's just so sweet and just like shows

218
00:07:36,913 --> 00:07:38,680
how much our kids love each other.

219
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,768
And I want to show it to you

220
00:07:39,768 --> 00:07:41,656
so it'll can melt your heart too.

221
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:42,782
Are you gonna give me a kiss?

222
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:43,782
Say bye bye.

223
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:45,989
- Baby.

224
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:47,392
- [Jared] Say baby.

225
00:07:47,392 --> 00:07:50,475
Oh do you want to give Calvin a kiss?

226
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,702
Give him his binky back.

227
00:07:56,702 --> 00:07:59,560
(Jared laughing)

228
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,158
Like how cute is that?

229
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,480
- And Calvin smiles.

230
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,346
- I know.

231
00:08:03,346 --> 00:08:04,187
Jackson takes out his binky,

232
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:05,651
he's like no I'm kissing you on the lips

233
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,134
if I'm kissing you.

234
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:08,846
It's just so sweet and I love

235
00:08:08,846 --> 00:08:10,926
that we have these videos to look back on

236
00:08:10,926 --> 00:08:13,063
and see all of these changes, you know?

237
00:08:13,063 --> 00:08:16,670
- Yes, and even Calvin,
I've talked about this too,

238
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,669
but (sighs)

239
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,717
everyday, Calvin kisses me, hugs me,

240
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:23,910
cuddles me, comes out
of the blue and hugs me,

241
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,493
and he always says Mama's baby.

242
00:08:26,493 --> 00:08:29,965
And lately, he's been not
only been saying Mama's baby

243
00:08:29,965 --> 00:08:31,361
and then he'll go baby?

244
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,049
And he'll point to my boobs

245
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,073
and I'm like no, and he goes baby?

246
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:37,009
And point to my stomach and I go yes,

247
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:38,721
the baby and he goes, I see?

248
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,921
And he lifts up my shirt
and he looks at my tummy

249
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,376
and he pats my tummy

250
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,736
and he goes baby.

251
00:08:43,736 --> 00:08:45,465
And it's so cute.

252
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,298
And then he lifts up his shirt,

253
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:48,327
and says baby on his stomach.

254
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,150
- He hasn't done that to me yet,

255
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,766
except for that one time
over there, but so anyway.

256
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:55,948
- [Ellie] So cute.

257
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,948
- Hey boys, we love you.

258
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:03,061
- But go to bed.
- Little punks.

259
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,311
(laughing)

260
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,287
- Mama's baby.

261
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,844
- Yeah Mama's baby.
- Why are you so sweet?

262
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:13,748
- Is that what you always
say to me, every day?

263
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:14,581
- Yeah.

264
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,095
- Is Jackson my baby?

265
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:18,928
- Yeah.

266
00:09:18,928 --> 00:09:20,542
- And Calvin's my baby?

267
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:21,799
- Yeah.

268
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:24,413
- [Jared] And where's the other baby?

269
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,632
(Calvin vocalizing)

270
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:29,811
- Where's the baby?
_ where did it go?

271
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:31,321
- In your tummy?

272
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,660
That's silly.

273
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,575
- Yeah.

274
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:35,075
- Where's my baby?

275
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:37,725
In my tummy?

276
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:38,558
- Yeah.

277
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:39,391
- Yeah.

278
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:41,622
I asked Jackson to go get in his jammies

279
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,518
a minute ago and he did.

280
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:44,516
Come here.

281
00:09:44,516 --> 00:09:46,796
And then he went back downstairs.

282
00:09:46,796 --> 00:09:47,669
Watch the water.

283
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,588
And he put on this outfit.

284
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,324
Why did you get dressed?

285
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,172
- Because.

286
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:53,800
- [Ellie] Because you wanted that outfit?

287
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,099
- But you know we're
getting ready for bed.

288
00:09:56,099 --> 00:09:58,642
- But I can sleep in gold ones.

289
00:09:58,642 --> 00:10:00,954
- [Ellie] You want to
sleep in your gold pants?

290
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:01,787
- Uh-huh.

291
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:04,534
- Like why is that so funny.

292
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:08,123
He totally changed back into clothes.

293
00:10:08,123 --> 00:10:09,123
You're silly.

294
00:10:09,123 --> 00:10:10,099
You can wear the shirt to bed,

295
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:12,754
but I think we should
find something comfy.

296
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:14,936
- But I have something comfy.

297
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:15,769
- [Ellie] Okay.

298
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:17,648
Okay mister, let's go to bed.

299
00:10:17,648 --> 00:10:18,481
- Okay.

300
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,314
- [Ellie] Okay.

301
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:20,863
I'll come down and put you to bed.

302
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:23,446
- No I don't want to go to bed.

303
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,053
- You're going to bed.

304
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:28,364
- I don't want to go to bed.
- You don't want to go to bed?

305
00:10:28,364 --> 00:10:29,311
- [Jackson] No.

306
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:32,438
- Okay, watch a movie
for two more minutes.

307
00:10:32,438 --> 00:10:33,658
- [Jackson] No five.

308
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:34,491
- Five?

309
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:35,324
- [Jackson] Six.

310
00:10:35,324 --> 00:10:36,157
- Six?

311
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:36,990
- [Jared] Four.

312
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,275
- Oh Dad says four, Dad rules all.

313
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,434
No one's looking at the clock.

314
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:42,836
I just will go down when I feel like it.

315
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:45,503
(festive music)

316
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,509
- I'm not gonna give you a kiss.

317
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:08,200
- No you have to.

318
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,091
- I'm not gonna do what you want.

319
00:11:11,091 --> 00:11:13,341
(laughing)

320
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:17,488
- I have to dip you,

321
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:19,113
you can't just throw your body back.

322
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:20,196
There you go.

323
00:11:21,092 --> 00:11:22,712
(laughing)

324
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:25,407
Look at our merch, like
you're blue and I'm read,

325
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:27,511
I feel like we're like double dragon.

326
00:11:27,511 --> 00:11:31,911
- I think I'm in love
with the cookie ones.

327
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:35,055
- Or like I'm Goku and you're Vegeta.

328
00:11:35,055 --> 00:11:35,888
- What?

329
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:41,286
Okay I don't know what
you're talking about.

330
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:42,119
I'm brushing my--

331
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,945
- Probably 99% of our audience

332
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:45,283
doesn't know what I'm talking about.

333
00:11:45,283 --> 00:11:46,890
- Okay good, I don't either.

334
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,934
I'm brushing my teeth.

335
00:11:47,934 --> 00:11:50,991
- I just nerded a little bit, I'm sorry.

336
00:11:50,991 --> 00:11:52,198
- [Ellie] Makes me so sick.

337
00:11:52,198 --> 00:11:53,429
- I'm sorry.

338
00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:55,454
- [Ellie] Isn't that the weirdest thing?

339
00:11:55,454 --> 00:11:57,051
- I guess a little bit.

340
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:58,884
But it's good for you.

341
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,181
- [Ellie] I know, that's why I'm doing it.

342
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:02,930
I haven't missed a day of flossing

343
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,384
since my last dentist appointment.

344
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:08,992
And we have a dentist
appointment next month,

345
00:12:08,992 --> 00:12:11,992
so I hope I have major improvements.

346
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,880
But I think that's gonna
be it for us tonight.

347
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,727
We're tired.

348
00:12:15,727 --> 00:12:17,052
We're gonna go straight to bed.

349
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:19,280
Maybe if there's a This is
Us online, we'll watch it.

350
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,113
- I think there is.

351
00:12:20,113 --> 00:12:20,946
- Okay.

352
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:21,779
Thanks for watching guys.

353
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:22,612
- I don't know, go see,

354
00:12:22,612 --> 00:12:23,445
and then we'll tell them if there is.

355
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:24,518
- Okay.
(Ellie laughs)

356
00:12:24,518 --> 00:12:25,937
(muffled mumbling)

357
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:27,435
According to the Hulu app,

358
00:12:27,435 --> 00:12:29,595
we are all caught up on This is Us,

359
00:12:29,595 --> 00:12:31,715
however, we do have a couple episodes

360
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:34,444
of Modern Family, and Rick and Morty.

361
00:12:34,444 --> 00:12:36,139
- [Ellie] No

362
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:36,972
- Okay.

363
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:38,027
