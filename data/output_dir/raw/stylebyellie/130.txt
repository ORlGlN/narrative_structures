1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Hey, guys.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,449
Before we get rolling into the vlog,

3
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:06,737
I have a pretty big
announcement, some good news.

4
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:11,207
Holiday merch is live! Echo, echo echo.

5
00:00:11,207 --> 00:00:14,245
Yes, if you click the link in
the description or the I card,

6
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:16,528
you will see that we have
some new holiday merch

7
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:18,116
that we're so excited about.

8
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:20,388
We've got Some Assembly Required,

9
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:23,327
we've got Cookies for,
not Santa, but for me,

10
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:25,700
we've got some mugs,
we've got some new things,

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,348
as well as classics
like the Ellie and Jared

12
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:30,394
circle logo and hoodies.

13
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:31,846
All of these designs are available

14
00:00:31,846 --> 00:00:33,703
in T-shirts, hoodies, and sweaters

15
00:00:33,703 --> 00:00:35,291
for a limited time only.

16
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,526
Like I said, the information is

17
00:00:36,526 --> 00:00:38,982
in the description down
below and in the I card.

18
00:00:38,982 --> 00:00:40,579
Check it out, get one for your friends,

19
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:42,465
get one for your family,
get one for you kids,

20
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:43,770
get one for your parents.

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,814
You guys are gonna love this.

22
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,573
There is something for everyone here.

23
00:00:46,573 --> 00:00:47,883
So be sure to check it out.

24
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:49,332
Let me know in the comments down below

25
00:00:49,332 --> 00:00:51,766
what is your favorite and
what you're planning to get.

26
00:00:51,766 --> 00:00:55,599
I found a worm on the sidewalk.

27
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:57,895
- [Jared] Whoa (laughs)

28
00:00:57,895 --> 00:00:59,680
Did you have a good day?
Yeah.

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,295
Can I have a kiss?

30
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,399
(smooches)

31
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,805
If I'm being completely honest,

32
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:08,235
I didn't think this would
be happening right now.

33
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,409
Right now.

34
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,242
This soon.

35
00:01:10,242 --> 00:01:11,661
- [Jared] This soon, this is a lot quicker

36
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:13,096
than I thought it would be.

37
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,141
It is time to move everything out.

38
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:16,909
- [Ellie] Good morning.

39
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:18,643
(laughing)

40
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,938
(whispering) Are we
trying to be really quiet?

41
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:25,679
(whispering) Yeah, everyone's asleep, huh?

42
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:28,679
Even little Miss Penny.

43
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:32,708
(laughing)

44
00:01:32,708 --> 00:01:35,625
What are you thinking?

45
00:01:43,903 --> 00:01:45,680
(barks)

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,793
(Ellie laughs)

47
00:01:46,793 --> 00:01:49,141
Are you gonna drive it more?

48
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:50,964
We need to charge, I
thought it was charging.

49
00:01:50,964 --> 00:01:52,868
We might need to charge it more.

50
00:01:52,868 --> 00:01:55,590
(barking)

51
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,841
(barking)

52
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:58,586
Pen Pen.

53
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,419
(laughing)

54
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,491
- [Jared] Penny might like
it more than Jackson does.

55
00:02:01,491 --> 00:02:02,387
Oh!

56
00:02:02,387 --> 00:02:03,525
- [Ellie] Penny!

57
00:02:03,525 --> 00:02:04,525
You okay?

58
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:08,352
Yeah, I think (fades).

59
00:02:08,352 --> 00:02:10,520
- [Ellie] We should charge it huh?

60
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,688
(upbeat music)

61
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,776
'Kay, hold it and put it in!

62
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,443
Whoa (laughing)

63
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:37,399
(talking excitedly)

64
00:02:41,813 --> 00:02:44,096
I'm gonna be racing.

65
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,392
- [Ellie] Come here, Mr. Cal!

66
00:02:46,392 --> 00:02:47,646
You are doing so good.

67
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,717
I think this may be Calvin's second time

68
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:51,069
with one of these carts.

69
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:53,146
He usually just likes to sit in the cart.

70
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,259
You are doing so good at teaching him.

71
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,331
You even held his cart while
I was getting the meat,

72
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:59,105
and he was like, no, not yet, Calvin.

73
00:02:59,105 --> 00:02:59,938
(laughs)

74
00:02:59,938 --> 00:03:02,237
Do you guys remember watching the vlog

75
00:03:02,237 --> 00:03:06,149
where Jackson, I think he
had one of those carts,

76
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:08,022
and he was really little,
but I had told him,

77
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,481
I was like, if you don't
follow me and listen,

78
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,617
we're gonna leave.

79
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:12,763
And we ended up having to leave the store

80
00:03:12,763 --> 00:03:15,221
because he had thrown
a fit and it was like,

81
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:17,075
he didn't do it since.

82
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,351
And it just seems fun.

83
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:21,520
We've come here for Jackson's whole life

84
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,463
and watching him--

85
00:03:22,463 --> 00:03:23,296
Mom, I need a treat--

86
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:24,332
- [Ellie] You want to get a treat?

87
00:03:24,332 --> 00:03:26,153
After we're all done shopping.

88
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:26,986
'Kay?

89
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:27,930
And it's just interesting.

90
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,690
We've been coming here
since Jackson was little,

91
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,836
like when he was first potty trained,

92
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,311
gotta run to the bathroom

93
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,429
and he had to go to the bathroom.

94
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:38,082
He learned how to be really
good using these carts.

95
00:03:38,082 --> 00:03:39,358
Calvin, come here!

96
00:03:39,358 --> 00:03:41,719
I did got thinking I learned

97
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:45,552
how to poop in a toilet right now!

98
00:03:46,872 --> 00:03:48,802
- [Ellie] 'Kay, you kids
are being really good.

99
00:03:48,802 --> 00:03:50,498
We bought all of our groceries.

100
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,601
Most of them, anyway.

101
00:03:51,601 --> 00:03:53,010
Ah, you've gotta be soft.

102
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,214
Gotta be soft with it.

103
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:55,476
I don't even know what I'm trying to say.

104
00:03:55,476 --> 00:03:56,358
I think I'm rambling.

105
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:58,924
Just, it's been really fun
coming to this grocery store

106
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:00,794
and watching the kids grow and learn.

107
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:03,027
Because, you know, you go
grocery shopping a lot.

108
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:05,468
And it's kind of a good
place to teach them.

109
00:04:05,468 --> 00:04:06,805
You know? (laughs)

110
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:09,566
'Kay, you're doing so
good, I'm so proud of you!

111
00:04:09,566 --> 00:04:11,994
Hold on tight, mister.

112
00:04:11,994 --> 00:04:13,565
Are you holding on tight?

113
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:15,225
(babbling)
(Ellie laughs)

114
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,225
It is day two of coming home from China,

115
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:20,348
so as far as jet lag goes, (laughs)

116
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:22,597
I am tired.

117
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:24,633
I did wake up pretty early this morning.

118
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,083
I was wide awake really early,

119
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:28,615
before everyone woke up.

120
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,172
Calvin and I woke up together.

121
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:32,243
And so I cleaned up the kitchen,

122
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:36,023
got everyone fed, we slowly
got ready for the day.

123
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:38,801
And I, yesterday, since coming home,

124
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:40,887
we didn't have much food in the fridge.

125
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,585
And so we went out to eat

126
00:04:42,585 --> 00:04:43,901
and it was kind of a bad idea

127
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,283
'cause I just felt even more gross.

128
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:49,806
So today I am making some awesome stew.

129
00:04:49,806 --> 00:04:52,840
I am making some beef soup.

130
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,161
Potatoes, carrots, celery,
all that, for dinner,

131
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:56,678
but it's gonna take all day to cook

132
00:04:56,678 --> 00:04:58,681
so that's there and I'm gonna make

133
00:04:58,681 --> 00:05:00,922
some stuffed bell peppers for lunch.

134
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,149
We got a bunch of Hello
Fresh in the mail today

135
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,356
so we are kind of set for the week.

136
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,073
So I feel much better about that.

137
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,658
But my stomach, I'm just like, I need,

138
00:05:09,658 --> 00:05:11,431
like the soup sounds so good to me.

139
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:12,806
I wish I could eat it right now.

140
00:05:12,806 --> 00:05:14,270
I wish it didn't take all day to cook.

141
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,530
But, that's what I'm doing.

142
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,490
Jackson, are you gonna go ride your,

143
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,122
are you taking your car out for a ride?

144
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:20,962
Yeah.

145
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,559
- [Ellie] 'Kay (laughing).

146
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,409
Just held the door open.

147
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:24,571
Let's get your shoes on!

148
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:25,483
What'd you find?

149
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:28,023
I found a worm on the sidewalk.

150
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:29,362
- [Ellie] Wow.

151
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,245
It rained a lot today.

152
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,747
And all the worms came out.

153
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:34,286
I'm done playing.

154
00:05:34,286 --> 00:05:35,565
- [Ellie] 'Kay, go put the worm out

155
00:05:35,565 --> 00:05:38,854
and then we'll wash your hands.

156
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:42,560
Go put him back outside and
then we can come back in.

157
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,579
It's my worm.

158
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:46,196
- [Ellie] It's your worm?

159
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,621
I don't want him inside.

160
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,551
Should we put him in a jar
and you can look at him?

161
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:53,311
No, is he gonna die?

162
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,109
- [Ellie] Yeah, if we put him in a jar.

163
00:05:55,109 --> 00:05:57,545
I leave him out is he gonna die?

164
00:05:57,545 --> 00:06:01,238
- [Ellie] Nope, if you put
him back outside, he'll live.

165
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:04,370
In the grass, he'll
have his food and water.

166
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,579
Why don't we go find a
good spot for him outside?

167
00:06:07,579 --> 00:06:10,272
No, maybe inside.

168
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,970
Maybe baggie.

169
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,161
- [Ellie] A bag?

170
00:06:14,161 --> 00:06:15,605
Is he gonna die in it?

171
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,688
- [Ellie] Yeah, I think
he needs to stay outside.

172
00:06:17,688 --> 00:06:19,950
'Cause that's where he'll live the best.

173
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:20,783
'Kay?

174
00:06:22,026 --> 00:06:24,781
He doesn't want to go outside anymore.

175
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:26,374
- [Ellie] (chuckles) He doesn't?

176
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:28,529
Mm-mmm, I don't want him to.

177
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:30,078
- [Ellie] 'Kay, you
look at him for a minute

178
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:31,846
and then you go put him
out when you're done.

179
00:06:31,846 --> 00:06:32,872
It's a noodle!

180
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,369
- [Ellie] It's a noodle?

181
00:06:34,369 --> 00:06:36,956
(laughs) I think he would taste gross.

182
00:06:36,956 --> 00:06:39,068
Calvin just ran out to me and goes,

183
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:41,170
Boots, off!

184
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,554
My boots off!

185
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:46,003
And so I took his shoes off
and the moment they were off,

186
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:50,077
he ran into a puddle of water and splashed

187
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,827
and jumped and laughed.

188
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:52,660
Come here!

189
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,673
And now he's tip-toeing
back 'cause he's barefoot.

190
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:58,570
Come show me your pants.

191
00:06:58,570 --> 00:06:59,691
(babbling)

192
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,550
Do you got an owwie?

193
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,090
Let's see.

194
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,257
Ah, well your pants are
soaking wet from the puddle.

195
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:11,053
Goofy.

196
00:07:11,053 --> 00:07:13,410
Oh, rocks!

197
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,644
Wow.

198
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:17,110
If I'm being completely honest,

199
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,598
I didn't think this would
be happening right now.

200
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:21,731
Right now.

201
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:22,929
This soon.
This soon.

202
00:07:22,929 --> 00:07:25,400
This is a lot quicker than
I thought it would be.

203
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,395
It is time to move everything out.

204
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:28,450
'Kay, Jackson, you hear that?

205
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,283
We've gotta move everything out.

206
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,482
All of this has to go.

207
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:33,315
'Kay?

208
00:07:33,315 --> 00:07:34,816
Can you help us with that?

209
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,205
Why does it need to go?

210
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,224
- [Jared] Well why do
you think it needs to go?

211
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,785
I don't want these things to go.

212
00:07:40,785 --> 00:07:43,063
- [Jared] (laughs) You
wanna keep these things?

213
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:43,896
Yeah.

214
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:45,237
- [Jared] Okay, well
I have some good news.

215
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:46,616
They're just going into the garage.

216
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:48,292
We're moving all of this
stuff into the garage

217
00:07:48,292 --> 00:07:50,034
because the hardwood floors are going

218
00:07:50,034 --> 00:07:52,828
to be refinished and resurfaced.

219
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:54,799
I don't know if we've
talked about it on the vlog,

220
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,471
but there's a couple places.

221
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:58,700
I have one in particular
right outside my office.

222
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,978
Where it's just,

223
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:03,103
you know, it's separating
just a little bit.

224
00:08:03,103 --> 00:08:04,510
So we need, do you feel that?

225
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:05,417
Is that kinda sharp?

226
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,272
So the hardwood floor guys
are coming on our anniversary.

227
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:09,772
(laughs)

228
00:08:09,772 --> 00:08:10,891
Happy eight years!

229
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,304
- [Jared] Happy eight year anniversary,

230
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,670
we're getting the hardwood floors done.

231
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,667
And they're coming to take care of it.

232
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:16,866
Oh, you wanna help too?

233
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:17,699
Okay.

234
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,688
I've got some good helpers.

235
00:08:19,688 --> 00:08:20,616
- [Ellie] Thanks!

236
00:08:20,616 --> 00:08:22,660
Don't worry, grandpa,
you're a good helper too.

237
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,830
(laughing)

238
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,997
(upbeat music)

239
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:30,233
Ready?
Ready.

240
00:08:30,233 --> 00:08:31,993
'Kay, we got our luggage.

241
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,217
- [Ellie] See you later!

242
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,969
- [Jared] Penny, you are
gonna be slipping around

243
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,044
like nobody's business! (laughs)

244
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:39,576
On the hardwood floors, anytime Penny

245
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:42,655
tries to take a fast
corner, she goes flying.

246
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:46,351
(laughs) Like she knows she
has to be hesitant a little bit

247
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,203
with her body, running around.

248
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,407
That's so funny.

249
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,084
The other thing I wanna
see is if you can see

250
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:54,067
the square where the rug has been.

251
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,578
Because, obviously there's
no foot traffic there

252
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,947
because of the rug.

253
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:01,790
And it's (laughing).

254
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,027
You're slipping and sliding everywhere!

255
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:05,893
Can you see the square?

256
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,475
Looks a little glossier.

257
00:09:07,475 --> 00:09:10,196
Oh my gosh, you can see
it way better on camera.

258
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:11,237
(laughing)

259
00:09:11,237 --> 00:09:12,811
It's almost like it's moving day.

260
00:09:12,811 --> 00:09:14,179
I know, I hate it.

261
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:16,076
I don't ever wanna do it again.

262
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,756
Do you remember when we walked in

263
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,594
and we were just like, holy crap.

264
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:20,966
This is home.

265
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,575
I still feel that way.

266
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:23,408
Oh yeah.

267
00:09:23,408 --> 00:09:24,629
Every time we wake up and come out here,

268
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,691
it's like, wow.

269
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,710
It's amazing.
Yeah.

270
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,839
We've got the frames of
the couches in the garage

271
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,554
and all of these cushions
are in Calvin's room.

272
00:09:32,554 --> 00:09:35,882
We've got a ton of couch
cushions right here.

273
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:38,222
You have so many couch
cushions in one place.

274
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,933
So many blankets in one place.

275
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:42,942
You think I know what I need to do.

276
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:43,971
And I'm gonna do that thing

277
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:45,332
that you're thinking of right now.

278
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:49,499
(upbeat music)

279
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,226
Alright, there it is.

280
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:55,975
(laughing)

281
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:58,594
We've got our entryway here.

282
00:09:58,594 --> 00:10:01,665
And we've got one path
that goes down here.

283
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:03,654
And we've got another
path that goes down here,

284
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,285
thanks to the help of George the giraffe,

285
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:08,316
who's being so good to us right now.

286
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,741
I think it's time we show the kids.

287
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:12,754
Oh, boys!

288
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:15,945
Time to come upstairs!

289
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:19,151
It echoes so much in here! (laughs)

290
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,946
(gibberish)

291
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,401
Come up here.

292
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:24,380
What is it?

293
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,784
- [Jared] I'll show you!

294
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:27,113
Are you ready to see this?

295
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:30,679
Yeah.

296
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:33,437
- [Jared] Open your eyes!

297
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:36,149
Whoa!
What?

298
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:37,484
- [Jared] It's a fort!

299
00:10:37,484 --> 00:10:39,848
Crawl inside!

300
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,777
(laughing)

301
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:45,308
Do you like it?

302
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:47,091
How did you do this?!

303
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:49,547
- [Jared] I used all the
couch cushions and blankets

304
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,576
and I made it.

305
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:51,425
How?

306
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:53,665
- [Jared] With my imagination.

307
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:54,639
I built it.

308
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,847
Crawl under here, there's
another path that you missed.

309
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:59,358
Go with him, Calvin.

310
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,469
(laughing)

311
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:03,831
Is that so cool?

312
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:04,969
Did you like it?

313
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,055
Yeah.

314
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,338
(Jared laughing)

315
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:10,784
(Jackson and Jared laughing)

316
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:11,818
Is this cool?

317
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:13,164
Yeah.

318
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:15,678
Bye!
Bye.

319
00:11:15,678 --> 00:11:16,836
Hi, Calvin.

320
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:17,669
Hi, bye.

321
00:11:17,669 --> 00:11:18,502
Hi, bye.

322
00:11:18,502 --> 00:11:20,776
Aww, is he dancing?

323
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:22,064
(upbeat music)

324
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:24,151
Whoa!

325
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:28,318
Little too much spin there.

326
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:33,258
- [Ellie] Are you gonna dance
with me when we're done?

327
00:11:33,258 --> 00:11:35,707
(Jared gasps)

328
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:37,266
- [Jared] That sounds fun.

329
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:41,433
(upbeat music)

330
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:54,950
We had a dance party.

331
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,646
Then we ate some Oreos.

332
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:58,145
Then we let Penny in.

333
00:11:58,145 --> 00:12:00,533
And now we're having another dance party.

334
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,077
Are you guys gonna go finish dancing?

335
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:06,315
Go finish dancing before we go to bed.

336
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:10,255
Whoo!

337
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:11,814
Yay!

338
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,947
(Jared laughing)

339
00:12:12,947 --> 00:12:16,898
(singing)

340
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:21,853
(laughing)

341
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:26,020
(singing)

342
00:12:31,673 --> 00:12:33,061
Did you have a good day?

343
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:33,894
Yeah.

344
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:36,629
Can I have a kiss?

345
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:39,284
(smooches)

346
00:12:39,284 --> 00:12:41,887
You're pretty happy today, huh?

347
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,761
He's been extra good today.

348
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:45,563
Someone came and snuck in here.

349
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:49,274
(whispering) Daddy's
looking for you, Calvin.

350
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,771
(kids shriek)

351
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,043
(kids laughing)

352
00:12:52,043 --> 00:12:55,112
What are you doing in here?!

353
00:12:55,112 --> 00:12:56,340
(boys laughing)

354
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,567
Do you wanna sleep with
your brother tonight?

355
00:12:58,567 --> 00:12:59,604
Mommy's bed.

356
00:12:59,604 --> 00:13:01,301
- [Jared] You wanna sleep in Mommy's bed?

357
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,344
Yeah!

358
00:13:02,344 --> 00:13:04,324
- [Jared] No, let's go sleep in your bed.

359
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:05,734
Yeah!
No.

360
00:13:05,734 --> 00:13:07,027
In your bed, in your bed!

361
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,961
- [Ellie] Everyone in their own beds.

362
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:10,376
- [Jared] Silly pants.

363
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:11,986
