1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:03,350
(gentle guitar music)

2
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:13,919
(Ellie laughs)

3
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:15,042
- I think it's funny.

4
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:16,088
- Good morning everyone.

5
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:16,921
Guess what?

6
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:20,536
Today I realized that it is October 14th,

7
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:21,764
and you know what that means?

8
00:00:21,764 --> 00:00:23,692
Well you probably don't, but I do.

9
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,237
Today is the day, last year,

10
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:28,948
that Ellie and I moved into our house.

11
00:00:28,948 --> 00:00:30,740
We have been in our house officially

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,240
for one full year.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:33,973
Yeah!

14
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:35,858
Last year we came to the
house nearly every day

15
00:00:35,858 --> 00:00:38,826
and we filmed some of the
big processes that they did

16
00:00:38,826 --> 00:00:40,258
with the drone circling the house

17
00:00:40,258 --> 00:00:41,810
so we could have a very special video

18
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,354
of the process of building it,

19
00:00:43,354 --> 00:00:44,819
and that video's gonna come out

20
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:45,652
a little bit later today,

21
00:00:45,652 --> 00:00:46,691
so stay tuned for that,

22
00:00:46,691 --> 00:00:49,394
because it's gonna be
so cool and exciting.

23
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:51,437
But not only that, it is a special day

24
00:00:51,437 --> 00:00:52,429
because of that anniversary,

25
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:54,205
but also because we're going to see

26
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:56,038
someone very special to us,

27
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:57,501
one of our IVF grant winners

28
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:00,038
is having a baby shower
and they invited us to come

29
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:01,994
and so we are so excited and thrilled

30
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:03,106
to be a part of that.

31
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,044
Also, we want to thank Emmelie and Kelsey

32
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:06,851
for watching the video
today and leaving a comment.

33
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:08,107
I just finished editing the video

34
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:09,047
and it's gonna be a big day,

35
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:10,123
so we gotta get started

36
00:01:10,123 --> 00:01:12,464
and I'm already behind,
let's get going for the day.

37
00:01:12,464 --> 00:01:14,002
Are you ready?

38
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,243
High five,

39
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,076
up high,

40
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,434
down low,

41
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:18,565
to the side,

42
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:19,398
too slow!

43
00:01:23,543 --> 00:01:24,479
Give me a kiss.

44
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,312
I love you.

45
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:26,680
- Where's the Bingo?

46
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,353
- Oh, I think Grandma knows where it is.

47
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:29,587
- [Grandma] Is it in here?

48
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:30,420
- [Jared] I think it's in there.

49
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,253
Go see.

50
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:32,086
I love you buddy.

51
00:01:32,086 --> 00:01:32,919
- Bye.

52
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,611
- I am excited to see our friends

53
00:01:34,611 --> 00:01:37,394
and I'm also excited to walk up and down

54
00:01:37,394 --> 00:01:39,998
the baby sections looking for

55
00:01:39,998 --> 00:01:41,575
an awesome gift for our friend.

56
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:44,465
We are going to Riley's baby shower.

57
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,250
She was one of the IVF grant winners.

58
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,842
But she also is our friend.

59
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:50,913
We have a really awesome

60
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,089
private message group,
between us and them,

61
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:55,946
that we're giving updates
and we talk and we cry.

62
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:57,783
And It's just, it has
been really fun getting

63
00:01:57,783 --> 00:01:59,928
to know them a little bit better.

64
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:00,761
And

65
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:01,875
- With all the IVF grant winners.

66
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,095
- We're looking at some baby monitors.

67
00:02:04,095 --> 00:02:05,178
Yes, I agree.

68
00:02:06,315 --> 00:02:09,257
I think I want to get her a baby carrier,

69
00:02:09,257 --> 00:02:11,955
because that was something
that was really fun

70
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:13,078
when I got,

71
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:13,911
- Oh yeah.

72
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,109
- but it's something

73
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:18,381
that's sometimes it's like
you don't have it right away,

74
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,434
'cause usually I wear a wrap with the baby

75
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,023
and then use a carrier later,

76
00:02:22,023 --> 00:02:23,551
so I think she'll like that.

77
00:02:23,551 --> 00:02:27,102
- Yeah, we loved having this
specific baby carrier, so.

78
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,026
- They have Tula's and

79
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:29,882
- Ergo's?

80
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:32,234
- Ergo's, those are two really nice ones,

81
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,411
and I really like the Tula's,

82
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,960
I feel like they're comfy on the baby,

83
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,621
because they come higher up,
like up on their necks so.

84
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:40,454
- This lady is wearing the same hat

85
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:42,127
as you are, just a different color.

86
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:43,141
- Twitter!

87
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:44,547
Seriously there are a few baby items

88
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:46,457
that I really like though on Amazon.

89
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:51,062
It's called Dohm, and it's like
a very light sound machine.

90
00:02:51,062 --> 00:02:53,365
We used that for a long time with Calvin.

91
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:55,211
I just put it away like a week ago.

92
00:02:55,211 --> 00:02:56,332
So the Dohm is really fun too,

93
00:02:56,332 --> 00:02:58,082
just for nice sounds,

94
00:02:58,943 --> 00:03:01,232
just a subtle sound for babies.

95
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:02,897
I really like that, as well.

96
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,483
If I was thinking, I should
have ordered her one,

97
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:07,516
'cause I think those are awesome to have.

98
00:03:07,516 --> 00:03:10,099
(tender music)

99
00:03:44,735 --> 00:03:46,118
Hi cute girls.

100
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:46,951
- Hi.

101
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:47,784
- How are you guys?

102
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:49,242
- Good.

103
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:51,639
Everyone's good, this is so fun.

104
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,655
- I love being with our little group.

105
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:54,643
- [Ellie] Me too.

106
00:03:54,643 --> 00:03:56,464
This is so cute.
- It's so cute.

107
00:03:56,464 --> 00:03:59,180
- Look how cute that is.

108
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,355
Everything is organized
by books, baby books.

109
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:05,002
- Yeah, it's the baby books theme,

110
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,465
that's so fun and so cute.

111
00:04:06,465 --> 00:04:07,298
- [Ellie] Good idea.

112
00:04:07,298 --> 00:04:08,131
It was your aunt?

113
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,027
- Yeah.

114
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,360
- Yeah, so cute.

115
00:04:11,387 --> 00:04:12,720
He's like, okay.

116
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,390
- [Jared] Thank you so much
for letting us hang out.

117
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,648
- Yeah, that's so much for coming.

118
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,091
- It was so fun to see you.

119
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:18,923
(laughing)

120
00:04:18,923 --> 00:04:20,639
Our kids are hiding.

121
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,760
- [Jackson] Boo!

122
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,489
- [Jared] Ahh!

123
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,738
Hi.

124
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,409
(gasps)

125
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:27,770
What is that?

126
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,002
- It's a mask.

127
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,543
- [Jared] It's a mask, it
is a transformer's mask?

128
00:04:31,543 --> 00:04:32,719
- Yeah, watch it.

129
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:35,302
- Okay, whoa, you look so cool.

130
00:04:36,185 --> 00:04:37,296
Hi Cal.

131
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:38,796
Well give me hugs.

132
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:41,633
Mmmm.

133
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,865
- Okay, they hid something for you too

134
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,057
in your room.

135
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:45,890
- Ooh.

136
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,723
- What did you hide Cal?

137
00:04:46,723 --> 00:04:48,774
- [Jared] What did you guys hide?

138
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:50,027
- Close your eyes.

139
00:04:50,027 --> 00:04:50,979
- [Jared] Close my eyes?

140
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:51,812
- [Jackson] Yeah.

141
00:04:51,812 --> 00:04:52,645
- Okay.

142
00:04:53,745 --> 00:04:54,793
- [Jackson] Don't see yet.

143
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,126
- Don't see yet.

144
00:04:57,377 --> 00:04:59,064
- Open your eyes.
- Don't look.

145
00:04:59,064 --> 00:05:01,481
- Oh, did you guys make this?

146
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:05,323
- We put a lot of stickers on it.

147
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:08,008
We put stickers on this side,

148
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,342
and all on the house

149
00:05:10,342 --> 00:05:11,930
and stuff inside.

150
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,212
- [Jared] And inside?

151
00:05:13,212 --> 00:05:14,045
- Yeah.

152
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,248
- [Elile] Jackson did you make that?

153
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:16,081
- Yeah.

154
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:17,354
- [Jared] Did you make that
with Grandma and Grandpa?

155
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:19,201
- I made it with,

156
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,476
it's for you and you.

157
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:21,459
- [Jared] Awww.

158
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,891
- It's for you and you.

159
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,302
- Awww.

160
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:27,219
Jackson, are there ghosts in there?

161
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:30,163
- Did you just make that out of like

162
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,765
- It was a box, yeah, I taped it.

163
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,405
- [Jared] Oh good, I'm glad
there's no ghosts in it.

164
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:36,730
- Just skeletons.

165
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,324
- [Jared] Just skeletons.

166
00:05:38,324 --> 00:05:39,196
(laughing)

167
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,092
That's so fun.

168
00:05:40,092 --> 00:05:41,892
Did you help too Calvin?

169
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:42,725
- Yeah.

170
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:46,588
- There's laughing
pumpkins, laughing pumpkins.

171
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:49,835
- [Jared] Yeah, Jackson this is so cool.

172
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:54,051
- Laughing pumpkins say
this, ha ha ha ha ha.

173
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:56,293
- [Jared] Is that a laughing pumpkin?

174
00:05:56,293 --> 00:05:57,960
Cool, that's so fun.

175
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:00,348
You guys are cute, you know.

176
00:06:00,348 --> 00:06:02,346
- It's your mom.

177
00:06:02,346 --> 00:06:03,626
- [Jared] I know it's just her.

178
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,459
(laughing)

179
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,806
- I'm gonna try and scare
the neighborhood kids.

180
00:06:06,806 --> 00:06:08,389
What are you doing?

181
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,749
(laughing)

182
00:06:12,853 --> 00:06:14,331
I think it's funny.

183
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,684
I told you the other day

184
00:06:15,684 --> 00:06:17,644
we always have neighborhood
kids coming over

185
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:18,984
asking to play with the Segways,

186
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:20,389
and the last two days,

187
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:22,534
we have had two new kids come to the door,

188
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:24,637
so now they all have to,

189
00:06:24,637 --> 00:06:25,798
whoever gets to the door first

190
00:06:25,798 --> 00:06:27,613
gets to play with the Segways so,

191
00:06:27,613 --> 00:06:28,574
I think it's cute.

192
00:06:28,574 --> 00:06:29,830
- Going to the baby shower today

193
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,163
was so exciting.

194
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:34,182
It was so enjoyable and it just made me

195
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:37,773
overwhelmed and filled with gratitude

196
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:41,158
that we had, even just
a small part to play

197
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,453
in this life changing experience

198
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:45,121
for Aaron and Riley.
- Hey,

199
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,384
- I want to say something too.

200
00:06:46,384 --> 00:06:48,031
- [Jared] You do?

201
00:06:48,031 --> 00:06:49,116
Well come on out and say it.

202
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:49,949
I'm talking about the baby shower.

203
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:50,782
- It's too cold.

204
00:06:50,782 --> 00:06:52,253
- [Jared] Oh, should I come inside then?

205
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:53,086
It is pretty chilly.

206
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,314
I was just saying how wonderful

207
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:56,801
the baby shower was.

208
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,085
- Oh yeah, we cheered up.

209
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:01,810
- Yeah, absolutely and I think
one of the coolest thoughts,

210
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,227
the coolest things is we knew

211
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:09,257
that this family would be so grateful.

212
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,784
We knew that the experience
would be so great.

213
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:14,163
When Aaron and Riley
shared with us their video

214
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,611
telling their family
that they won the grant,

215
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:18,107
they were at a church party

216
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,805
and they had all of their
family and friends there,

217
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:24,518
and the whole church
uproared with excitement

218
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:26,363
and joy and laughter.

219
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,404
And it was just, it was so cool to see

220
00:07:29,404 --> 00:07:31,920
and to have a small part of,

221
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,983
and I'm so excited for Aaron and Riley.

222
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,520
Congratulations guys,

223
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,936
this is gonna be so wonderful.

224
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,674
I mean it was just so fun to be there.

225
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,378
- Yeah, it was a special feeling.

226
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,890
We had a really good day.

227
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,317
- Yeah, it really was nice.
- Just talking.

228
00:07:45,317 --> 00:07:48,797
- Trying to figure out
if we can do this again.

229
00:07:48,797 --> 00:07:50,959
Jared's been on the phone and email,

230
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,600
well it's that time of year, you know,

231
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,323
it's right before the holidays.

232
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:57,510
And last year was a
little crazy in December,

233
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,730
and this year we've learned a lot.

234
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,099
I can't promise anything,

235
00:08:01,099 --> 00:08:03,845
but we are trying to see if we can

236
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,299
get some sponsors,

237
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:07,611
and trying to see if we can do it,

238
00:08:07,611 --> 00:08:08,444
and we're excited.

239
00:08:08,444 --> 00:08:10,749
- Yeah, I mean we did it once,

240
00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:13,472
but how cool would it be
- to it again.

241
00:08:13,472 --> 00:08:14,305
- to do it again.

242
00:08:14,305 --> 00:08:17,903
Like Ellie says, it was a big process,

243
00:08:17,903 --> 00:08:19,929
and we've learned a lot

244
00:08:19,929 --> 00:08:22,017
to do going forward.

245
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:24,098
But yeah, it's a big process,

246
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:25,943
and we had a lot of help last year

247
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:28,340
and I am so incredibly grateful

248
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,391
for everyone who helped last year.

249
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:32,078
They're a big part of our lives now.

250
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,102
So we're gonna try and do this again.

251
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:36,697
On a completely unrelated note, Ellie

252
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:38,450
- I'm still working on this stupid puzzle.

253
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,932
- [Jared] Well it doesn't
help that one of the kids,

254
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:41,878
when we had all the kids over.

255
00:08:41,878 --> 00:08:42,820
- Oh totally

256
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,268
- [Jared] They had their fair
share of fun at the puzzle.

257
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:45,935
- Yeah, my kids too.

258
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:50,019
- [Jared] They demolished
what was the majority

259
00:08:50,019 --> 00:08:50,852
of the puzzle that was completed,

260
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:52,686
so we're trying to put it back together.

261
00:08:52,686 --> 00:08:54,758
When I edited the video of this,

262
00:08:54,758 --> 00:08:55,616
- [Ellie] Could you even tell?

263
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:56,927
- You could kinda tell,

264
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:59,187
but it is not as bad on the video

265
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:00,020
as it is in person.

266
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,575
Like I have a headache looking at it.

267
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:03,347
- Oh I know, like every piece you look at,

268
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,695
it's moving, like what the?

269
00:09:04,695 --> 00:09:08,511
- [Jared] And the bigger
the pattern, the more it

270
00:09:08,511 --> 00:09:09,344
- [Ellie] Moves.

271
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:10,366
- [Jared] You can't even see it, but

272
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,166
- This puzzle moves.

273
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,533
Just believe us.

274
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,749
- Ellie and I have been in our house

275
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:18,277
for exactly one year.

276
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:21,142
One year ago today we moved into our place

277
00:09:21,142 --> 00:09:22,725
and it has been the best year,

278
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:25,741
the craziest year, the
most exciting year ever.

279
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:27,615
And I'm glad you guys have
been along for the ride.

280
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,951
It's been so fun.

281
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,159
And I can't wait to see what happens next.

282
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,870
Most of you probably know that we filmed

283
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,509
the entire process of
us building the house.

284
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,877
And that video's gonna come
out a little bit later today,

285
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,668
the drone footage, circling the house,

286
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:42,401
every step of the process being built.

287
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:43,234
So stay tuned for that.

288
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,912
Make sure you thumbs up that video

289
00:09:44,912 --> 00:09:47,046
and this one, and we will
see you guys tomorrow.

290
00:09:47,046 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
