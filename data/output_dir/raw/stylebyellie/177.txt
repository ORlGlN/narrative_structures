1
00:00:00,086 --> 00:00:04,253
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:13,353 --> 00:00:15,589
- [Jared] What Jackson?

3
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:16,427
- [Ellie] Come here.

4
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,667
- [Jared] You didn't tell
us you were an artist.

5
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:20,011
- [Ellie] Come here.

6
00:00:20,011 --> 00:00:22,594
Did you draw this at preschool?

7
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:26,832
And it says your family.

8
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:28,320
Tell me who your family is.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,681
- [Jared] Yeah, who's in your family?

10
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:33,400
- [Jackson] You and mommy and Calvin

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,385
and Boston and Cody.

12
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,342
- [Jared] Oh my goodness.

13
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:39,079
- [Ellie] Did you draw their faces?

14
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:39,912
- [Jackson] Uh huh.

15
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:40,920
- [Jared] That looks so good.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,109
- [Jackson] And mouths, nose, eyes.

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:43,942
- [Ellie] Jackson.

18
00:00:43,942 --> 00:00:44,776
- [Jared] That looks so good.

19
00:00:44,776 --> 00:00:46,108
Is that Calvin's hair?

20
00:00:46,108 --> 00:00:46,941
- [Jackson] Yup.

21
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:48,001
- [Jared] Yeah.

22
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:50,201
- [Jackson] I forgot to draw this hair.

23
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:51,137
- [Ellie] That's okay.

24
00:00:51,137 --> 00:00:52,230
- [Jared] Oh that's okay.

25
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,642
- [Ellie] Jackson, aw that makes me smile.

26
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:57,447
That is so tender.

27
00:00:57,447 --> 00:00:58,982
That is Cody and Boston.

28
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:01,328
- [Jared] He is, they're
our family, Cody and Boston.

29
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,802
- [Ellie] And, do you
know what letter this is?

30
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:04,010
- [Jackson] "T."

31
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,893
- [Ellie] Is that a "T?"

32
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:07,407
What about b-b?

33
00:01:07,407 --> 00:01:08,881
- [Jackson] Bug.

34
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,961
- [Ellie] "B?"

35
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:11,075
- [Jackson] B-b- "B."

36
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:13,073
- [Ellie] Did you trace all the "b's?"

37
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,539
- [Jared] Looks good,
uppercase and lowercase.

38
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:16,639
- [Ellie] This made my day.

39
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:17,794
- [Jared] This is so cute.

40
00:01:17,794 --> 00:01:18,844
Oh yeah.

41
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:20,230
- [Ellie] I love you.

42
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,195
- [Jackson] I love you too.

43
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,128
- [Jared] Hey, give me a kiss.

44
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:24,478
Love you.

45
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:25,620
- I love this.

46
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,103
Where is my, I gotta
take a picture of this.

47
00:01:28,103 --> 00:01:31,745
(light guitar music)

48
00:01:31,745 --> 00:01:33,995
(laughing)

49
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,263
- [Jared] You sure know
how to move that finger.

50
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,346
(laughing)

51
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,179
- [Jared] Hello.

52
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:41,894
I am a romper, and I am so scary I'm cute.

53
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:42,727
See?

54
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,626
The sign says it so it must be true.

55
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:45,459
Rawr.

56
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,306
I'm looking for someone named Calvin.

57
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:50,900
I want to put him inside of my clothing.

58
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,008
Is that weird?

59
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:53,156
Did I take it a little too far?

60
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,934
Yes you did, you took it a little too far.

61
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:57,434
This pocket is for candy only.

62
00:01:59,064 --> 00:01:59,897
Get out of town.

63
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:00,730
Get out of town.

64
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,160
Jackson, Calvin this is just for you.

65
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,143
- This is coming for you Jacks.

66
00:02:04,143 --> 00:02:07,276
- [Jared] Fidget spinner Lush bar?

67
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:08,109
Does it smell good?

68
00:02:08,109 --> 00:02:09,017
- Happiness all in one.

69
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:10,987
- [Jared] There you go.

70
00:02:10,987 --> 00:02:15,821
- Let it be know, Jared just
tried to order a baked potato.

71
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,379
Mama Mecham did you just hear that?

72
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:20,110
Jared Mecham just tried
to order a baked potato.

73
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,279
- Willingly, willingly.

74
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,025
On my own accord I made
that decision, but I didn't.

75
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:25,142
- [Ellie] You're grown up.

76
00:02:25,142 --> 00:02:26,128
- They didn't have them.

77
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:26,961
- [Ellie] Oh.

78
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:27,794
- I can't do...

79
00:02:27,794 --> 00:02:28,896
- [Ellie] Potato fries.

80
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:29,999
- I can't do mashed yet.

81
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:30,997
Baked, yes.

82
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,411
Fries, of course right?

83
00:02:32,411 --> 00:02:33,244
Duh.

84
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:34,108
Sweet potato.

85
00:02:34,108 --> 00:02:34,941
Are those a little healthier?

86
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:36,816
I don't know, maybe.

87
00:02:36,816 --> 00:02:39,262
I feel like I should have
explained why this is significant.

88
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:41,924
If you guys know me at all,
or are a part of my family,

89
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,757
I've hated potatoes my entire life.

90
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:45,853
Of course I've been able to
eat fries because they're

91
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:48,356
fried potatoes and you
don't taste the potato.

92
00:02:48,356 --> 00:02:50,788
Steak fries, jo jo's, those are
a little bit more difficult.

93
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,515
But, my entire life I just
haven't like potatoes.

94
00:02:53,515 --> 00:02:55,541
But, ever since I went to
Finland, and that's like

95
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,068
a huge staple in Finland
is eating potatoes,

96
00:02:58,068 --> 00:02:59,307
I grew to like them.

97
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:01,765
But it really, what it
comes down to is like,

98
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,815
I like potatoes with my ranch.

99
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:05,071
- Totally, totally.

100
00:03:05,071 --> 00:03:05,904
- Isn't that so bad?

101
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:07,143
That is really really bad.

102
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,116
But I'm actually, it's growing on me.

103
00:03:09,116 --> 00:03:10,433
It's just something that has taken

104
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:13,265
29 years of my life to grow on me.

105
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:15,115
So, after this I guess tomatoes is next.

106
00:03:15,115 --> 00:03:16,308
Ew.

107
00:03:16,308 --> 00:03:18,540
What just happened?

108
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,123
Oh my gosh tell me.

109
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,094
- Calvin just pooped in the toilet.

110
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:23,927
- [Jared] No.

111
00:03:23,927 --> 00:03:26,904
- Jackson and Calvin are
both proud little boys.

112
00:03:26,904 --> 00:03:28,269
(laughing)

113
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,795
- I swear this happened with Jackson too.

114
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:31,852
- Damn.

115
00:03:31,852 --> 00:03:33,241
- How do we miss this?

116
00:03:33,241 --> 00:03:35,000
- [Ellie] Both boys.

117
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,334
- [Jared] Jackson pooped
at Bonnie's house.

118
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,445
- [Ellie] For the first time.

119
00:03:37,445 --> 00:03:39,635
- [Jared] For the first time, and now

120
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,031
the way it sounds, you'd
make it think it's us but

121
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,161
it's not I promise you we try and do this.

122
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:45,103
- We are good parents.

123
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:47,240
Calvin is the cutest thing.

124
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,073
- [Jared] Oh, it's so sweet.

125
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:51,378
- [Ellie] The last two weeks,
every time Jackson goes

126
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:54,001
to the potty Calvin wants
to get on, which is great

127
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,447
cause it took a long time for Jackson

128
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:57,770
to warm up to even getting on the potty.

129
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,376
He flushed it away very fast.

130
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:00,272
- [Jared] Oh how cute.

131
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,256
- I said take a picture.

132
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:02,108
- [Jared] Oh no.

133
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:03,464
(laughing)

134
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:06,393
- Only a mom would want
this in this situation.

135
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:08,919
- And we've been trying to
get him to go on the potty,

136
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,098
like just warming him up to
it, and today he must've gone.

137
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:14,164
- Aww, how sweet.

138
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,084
That is the cutest thing ever.

139
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:18,263
Calvin, that is so cute.

140
00:04:18,264 --> 00:04:20,620
But it's true, like, every
time Jackson goes potty

141
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,631
Calvin's like "I wanna go, I wanna go."

142
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:25,540
And he'll take off his pants and he'll

143
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,623
take off his diaper and
he'll want to climb up.

144
00:04:27,623 --> 00:04:29,573
So we help him do it and it's just like

145
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:30,745
getting those motions in.

146
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:31,686
- [Ellie] Yup.

147
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:34,692
- And it just finally
now he actually did it.

148
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:36,332
Cause he sits on the toilet all the time.

149
00:04:36,332 --> 00:04:37,658
- So proud of him!

150
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:38,609
- [Jared] I know.

151
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,994
- I've had a wonderful date today.

152
00:04:40,994 --> 00:04:43,802
Jared just took me out
and we have shopped,

153
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:45,000
we've played, we've cried.

154
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,600
I've loved it, loved it.

155
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,433
- Yup.

156
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,336
We're actually down here in Salt Lake

157
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:51,061
because we have a meeting for CVX Live.

158
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:51,945
Oh no, that's not for a while though.

159
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:53,813
But, we're talking about
next years CVX Live

160
00:04:53,813 --> 00:04:56,079
and everything going forward.

161
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,604
Is it locked?

162
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:58,437
That's weird.

163
00:04:58,437 --> 00:05:00,354
Here, I've got an idea.

164
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,624
Here you go.

165
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:06,093
- Oh, thank you.

166
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:07,126
- [Jared] You're welcome.

167
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:08,726
- [Ginger] You have to bite it in half.

168
00:05:08,726 --> 00:05:11,059
- [Jared] You are so lucky.

169
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,518
- Did you have fun with her?

170
00:05:14,518 --> 00:05:15,433
I miss you.

171
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,805
- [Jared] I can't believe
we ran into you guys.

172
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:17,705
- Oh, fancy seeing you here.

173
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:18,538
- [Jared] I know.

174
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:19,589
- We must be sisters or something.

175
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:20,558
- [Jared] Sisters.

176
00:05:20,558 --> 00:05:22,698
And Carl and Ginger, have we vlogged that

177
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:24,201
we're with Carl and Ginger yet?

178
00:05:24,201 --> 00:05:26,255
We met up with Carl and Ginger too cause

179
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:28,058
we've got important business to discuss.

180
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,383
- We're so businessy today.

181
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:32,162
- [Jared] Yeah, we're
wearing our business attire.

182
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:35,130
- This is my "I'm getting crap done."

183
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,586
- We're adulting now.

184
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,752
- Yes, initiate adulting mode.

185
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,158
Now you're probably wondering why

186
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:41,863
I've gathered you all here to...

187
00:05:41,863 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm sorry.

188
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,413
What's up everyone?

189
00:05:44,413 --> 00:05:45,500
How's it going?

190
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,897
Look at this crew that we've got

191
00:05:46,897 --> 00:05:48,371
here around the dinner table.

192
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,617
What's up guys, how's it going?

193
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:53,439
We're having hamburgers
and hotdogs and I think

194
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,952
the coolest thing about this
is they have JDawg Sauce.

195
00:05:56,952 --> 00:05:59,471
If you've never had the pleasure
of having a JDawg hotdog,

196
00:05:59,471 --> 00:06:02,812
you don't know what the special
sauce is and it's amazing.

197
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:03,645
- Let's eat.

198
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:05,279
- So we're all sitting on this couch.

199
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:07,383
This is a U shaped couch
and we're all sittin' here.

200
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:10,077
And then we've got John
and Brett over here.

201
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:13,465
I feel like we're in trouble
at school and these guys are

202
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:17,117
gonna give us a scolding
or something like that.

203
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:17,950
Oh family of-

204
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,163
My heart is not pounding.

205
00:06:19,163 --> 00:06:21,958
- Either getting invited or
not getting invited to CVX.

206
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:24,331
(laughing)

207
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:25,542
- [Jared] Are you freaking kidding me?

208
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:27,681
Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, the car's moving.

209
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,099
It's moving on its own.

210
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:29,932
- [Dan] I'm summoning the car.

211
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:30,765
- [Jared] What?

212
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,598
- [Dan] With an app.

213
00:06:31,598 --> 00:06:32,761
- [Friend] Let's see
how smart it really is.

214
00:06:32,761 --> 00:06:34,654
(laughing)

215
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:35,579
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

216
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,128
- [Friend] Move it, it's
not that smart watch out.

217
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:39,162
- [Jared] It's not that smart watch out!

218
00:06:39,162 --> 00:06:40,126
- [Ellie] Don't, don't.

219
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,132
- [Jared] Oh, it is that smart!

220
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,140
- [Dan] It's stopping.

221
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,402
- [Jared] It's stopping.

222
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,674
- [Dan] It stopped, it really did.

223
00:06:44,674 --> 00:06:45,694
- [Jared] It is that smart.

224
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:48,026
Oh my gosh.

225
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:49,192
Dude, Dan.

226
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,515
Freaking Dan.

227
00:06:50,515 --> 00:06:53,095
We're playing with his Tesla right now.

228
00:06:53,095 --> 00:06:53,928
Oh my gosh.

229
00:06:53,928 --> 00:06:56,433
Ellie, you're gonna let Ellie drive it?

230
00:06:56,433 --> 00:06:58,109
- [Dan] Walk up to the front door.

231
00:06:58,109 --> 00:07:00,271
- [Jared] Let's watch this in action.

232
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,403
- [Dan] Don't touch the door though.

233
00:07:01,403 --> 00:07:02,986
Just walk up to it.

234
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,983
- [Ellie] Oh, mother!

235
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,816
- [Dan] Let me open it for you.

236
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:07,982
- Do I not weigh enough?

237
00:07:07,982 --> 00:07:08,815
- [Dan] Alright.

238
00:07:08,815 --> 00:07:10,328
(laughing)

239
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,562
It should've recognized the key.

240
00:07:11,562 --> 00:07:13,516
Okay so go ahead and hop in.

241
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,924
- [Jared] Hop in and put
your foot on the break.

242
00:07:14,924 --> 00:07:16,027
- [Ellie] Jared should be sitting in here.

243
00:07:16,027 --> 00:07:16,860
(yelling)

244
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,693
This is cool.

245
00:07:17,693 --> 00:07:18,526
- [Dan] Hold on.

246
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:19,693
First, let's adjust it.

247
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,542
You're small, let's do Kenzie she's small.

248
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:22,788
- [Ellie] This is the break.

249
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:25,956
- [Dan] Okay put your foot on the break.

250
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:27,809
- [Jared] It does it by itself dude.

251
00:07:27,809 --> 00:07:29,198
This is incredible.

252
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,512
Oh my gosh, Ellie.

253
00:07:30,512 --> 00:07:32,877
You're driving this Tesla.

254
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:34,093
Carl, hop in man.

255
00:07:34,093 --> 00:07:35,129
- [Carl] What?

256
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,018
Where's Ginger?

257
00:07:36,018 --> 00:07:37,280
Why did she leave?

258
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,113
- [Jared] So you could do a, they

259
00:07:38,113 --> 00:07:38,946
could do a bench see Ellie?

260
00:07:38,946 --> 00:07:39,937
- Look, the key is like a car!

261
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:42,283
- [Jared] It is a little car.

262
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,324
- [Carl] Let's go fight crime.

263
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,220
- [Dan] Watch out for the speed bumps.

264
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,111
They're kinda crazy but you
gotta give it, you gotta

265
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:47,270
punch it and give it a shot.

266
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,501
- [Jared] Okay well wait till there's

267
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,387
not a car in front of us.

268
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,833
Oh falcon wing doors, holy crap.

269
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:54,297
Ellie, okay so seriously.

270
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:56,722
There's, it's really, really fast,

271
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:59,552
so watch out for the truck
in front of us please.

272
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:00,385
- [Ellie] Is he being serious?

273
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:01,785
Well it's not fast unless I drive it fast.

274
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:02,751
[Jared] Yeah, you have to punch it but

275
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:03,717
just like, just be careful.

276
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:04,895
- [Ellie] I don't want to punch it.

277
00:08:04,895 --> 00:08:06,398
I'm just gonna drive how I want.

278
00:08:06,398 --> 00:08:07,231
- [Jared] Okay.

279
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:08,582
- It's not driving by itself.

280
00:08:08,582 --> 00:08:09,415
- [Jared] Not yet.

281
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:10,248
Well you're in "park."

282
00:08:10,248 --> 00:08:12,143
(laughing)

283
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:13,117
- [Jared] There you go, now you're...

284
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:13,950
- [Ellie] Okay, drive.

285
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,361
Now if I let go, its
not gonna punch itself.

286
00:08:16,361 --> 00:08:17,932
- [Jared] I don't, you
can drive it normal, yeah.

287
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:18,765
- [Ellie] Yeah.

288
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,637
- [Dan] Good luck.

289
00:08:20,637 --> 00:08:23,044
(yelling)

290
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,073
(laughing)

291
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:26,000
- [Ellie] That's smooth.

292
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,522
- [Jared] That is smooth as butter.

293
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:28,594
Holy crap.

294
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:29,596
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh, my heart.

295
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,450
I'm sweating.

296
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,693
I didn't go way fast but I punched it

297
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:34,075
and you don't even hear it rev.

298
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:34,909
- [Jared] Yeah.

299
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,775
Isn't that the craziest thing?

300
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,927
There's no engine.

301
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:39,611
Well there is an engine
but it's not a gas engine.

302
00:08:39,611 --> 00:08:41,751
- [Ellie] Like it feels really good.

303
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:43,490
- [Jared] It's kinda unnerving that...

304
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,178
- [Ellie] Jared I feel
bad I'm driving it because

305
00:08:45,178 --> 00:08:46,459
this is like what you want.

306
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,885
- [Jared] No, this is totally fine.

307
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:49,869
Cause I'm gonna drive it after.

308
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:50,707
(laughing)

309
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:51,724
- This is beautiful.

310
00:08:51,724 --> 00:08:52,839
- [Jared] Do you like it?

311
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:53,839
- I love it.

312
00:08:57,097 --> 00:08:58,719
This is very beautiful.

313
00:08:58,719 --> 00:08:59,865
This is smooth.

314
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:02,275
I can't believe he's
letting me drive his car.

315
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,018
Does he know I failed Driver's Ed?

316
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:06,642
This is beautiful!

317
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:07,689
Okay, you drive it now.

318
00:09:07,689 --> 00:09:08,522
- [Jared] Okay.

319
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:09,648
Oh my gosh I'm kind of nervous.

320
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,742
Are you guys ready?

321
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:16,064
(yelling)

322
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:18,345
- [Ginger] Oh my gosh, wow.

323
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:19,677
- [Jared] Wasn't that crazy?

324
00:09:19,677 --> 00:09:21,698
- It was so cool.

325
00:09:21,698 --> 00:09:23,131
- I only got up to like 45.

326
00:09:23,131 --> 00:09:24,389
- [Camera Operator] No way.

327
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:25,539
- Oh my gosh.

328
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,230
- [Kid] Only 45 it feels like your like...

329
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,319
- This is so spacious.

330
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,097
- [Camera operator] Oh my
goodness this is so awesome.

331
00:09:31,097 --> 00:09:32,729
Hey Jared, are you getting one?

332
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,277
- I freaking want one.

333
00:09:34,277 --> 00:09:35,110
Ready?

334
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,943
- Yeah.

335
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,776
(squealing)

336
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:43,460
- [Kid] It feels like you're on like...

337
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,293
- A rollercoaster?

338
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:47,319
- [Friend] A rollercoaster
when it's about to go up.

339
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,478
- [Camera Operator] It
does feel like that.

340
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:50,417
That's how smooth it is.

341
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:51,521
And there's no sound.

342
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:54,507
- These seats are so cushy.

343
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:55,569
- [Camera Operator]
And there's no exhaust.

344
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:58,484
You could like, run this
in your garage and not die.

345
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:00,371
- There's a camping
mode that you can do so

346
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:02,600
you can like sleep in it
and let it keep it on.

347
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,433
- [Camera Operator] Oh my goodness.

348
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:04,266
That's so cool.

349
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,719
- [Dan] Okay, which one
did you like better?

350
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,592
- [Jared] Thanks Dan.

351
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:07,425
- [Dan] You're welcome.

352
00:10:07,425 --> 00:10:08,962
(laughing)

353
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:13,076
All you need for good hugs
from Jared is a brand new car.

354
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:16,530
- I really like the seats
on the Model X versus the S.

355
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,834
- [Dan] The white interior is beautiful.

356
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,149
You can get the white interior in the S,

357
00:10:20,149 --> 00:10:22,868
which, it's possible but
we didn't have another one.

358
00:10:22,868 --> 00:10:24,535
- [Jared] I mean the falcon,
like everything is just

359
00:10:24,535 --> 00:10:26,046
so crazy cool about it dude.

360
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:26,879
- Look at this.

361
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,314
Did you see even in the back?

362
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:29,780
There's drink holders back there and

363
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,492
there's USB ports to charge
if you look in the front.

364
00:10:32,492 --> 00:10:33,917
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

365
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:34,750
What do you call it?

366
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,583
The "frunk?"

367
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:36,910
Can you show me the frunk?

368
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,743
- Who has the key?

369
00:10:37,743 --> 00:10:38,671
- [Jared] Ellie do you have the key?

370
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,548
I think it's in there.

371
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,003
Ellie, there's a frunk.

372
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:42,250
Do you want to see the frunk?

373
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,083
- Yeah.

374
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:44,134
- [Jared] I just like saying frunk.

375
00:10:44,134 --> 00:10:45,826
(yelling)

376
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:46,817
- [Jared] This is called a frunk.

377
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,099
This is a frunk.

378
00:10:48,099 --> 00:10:51,768
- Ellie, get in the frunk.

379
00:10:51,768 --> 00:10:54,089
- [Jared] There's room for
one in the back and the front.

380
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:55,256
Get it in now.

381
00:10:56,408 --> 00:10:58,986
This is a pretty rare
occasion that Ellie and I,

382
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:00,607
we are actually just gonna stay the night

383
00:11:00,607 --> 00:11:02,860
here in Salt Lake City, Utah.

384
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,763
Just for the evening because
it is actually really late.

385
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:05,596
It's midnight.

386
00:11:05,596 --> 00:11:06,494
And then we're gonna hang out with

387
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:07,927
Carl and Ginger for a little bit.

388
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,693
But we walked into our hotel
room, I've gotta show you this.

389
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:11,980
- [Ellie] I like it.

390
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,797
- [Jared] Ellie loves it and I feel like

391
00:11:15,797 --> 00:11:19,616
it looks and definitely
smells like a grandma's room.

392
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:20,814
That's my first thought.

393
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,820
I was like, I feel like
this is grandma's room.

394
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,065
- Well, it's an older place but I love it.

395
00:11:26,065 --> 00:11:28,411
- [Jared] Yeah, it's actually
a pretty nice hotel so.

396
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:29,394
Okay, ready for bed?

397
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,197
- [Ellie] I didn't bring pajamas.

398
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,775
- [Jared] Do you wanna wear my pajamas?

399
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,616
Okay.

400
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:35,289
No, Ellie, we went to the store and

401
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,637
got pajama pants for me.

402
00:11:36,637 --> 00:11:38,538
You could wear the shorts
and I can wear pajama pants.

403
00:11:38,538 --> 00:11:39,738
We win!

404
00:11:39,738 --> 00:11:42,849
- Alright guys, this is the
pants that I am wearing.

405
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:43,832
These are Jared's.

406
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,493
Don't I look sassy?

407
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:47,250
- [Jared] I think you look sassy and sexy.

408
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,344
- And Jared, you, I don't know
if I'm more attracted to you

409
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:54,536
cause you just, I just
loved on him all week.

410
00:11:54,536 --> 00:11:56,290
You just have been so good to me.

411
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,321
But look at those pants.

412
00:11:58,321 --> 00:12:00,154
Look at those joggers.

413
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:03,578
We got him new pajama pants.

414
00:12:03,578 --> 00:12:07,222
You are a turd, stand normal.

415
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:08,380
Stand normal!

416
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,672
(laughing)

417
00:12:09,672 --> 00:12:11,728
You look very cute.

418
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:12,561
Love them.

419
00:12:13,424 --> 00:12:14,614
Come on Peter Pan.

420
00:12:14,614 --> 00:12:16,632
- I can't believe like I had one of my

421
00:12:16,632 --> 00:12:18,021
biggest dreams come true today.

422
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:20,454
We drove a Tesla and, in
fact, Ellie you did it first.

423
00:12:20,454 --> 00:12:22,312
- And, it was wonderful Jared.

424
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:23,145
- [Jared] It was wonderful.

425
00:12:23,145 --> 00:12:24,462
And you know what else was wonderful?

426
00:12:24,462 --> 00:12:26,199
Hanging out with you Ginger and Carl.

427
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:27,032
- [Ginger] Oh, thanks.

428
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:27,865
- [Jared] Yeah.

429
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:30,694
- Me and Jared have already
built two Teslas on the website.

430
00:12:30,694 --> 00:12:32,038
- [Jared] We did.

431
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:33,635
- We're doing a little dream shopping.

432
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,885
- I just looked at Instagram.

433
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:39,693
- It is 1:20 in the
morning so we have to call

434
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:42,187
it a night so we can get this
video up to your eyeballs.

435
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:43,729
So thank you guys so much for watching.

436
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:46,489
Have a wonderful evening and
we will see you tomorrow.

437
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:49,926
Bye!

438
00:12:49,926 --> 00:00:00,000
That's my bum.
