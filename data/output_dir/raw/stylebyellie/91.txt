1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:01,693
- Mommy!

2
00:00:01,693 --> 00:00:02,957
Mommy!

3
00:00:02,957 --> 00:00:03,790
Mommy!

4
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:06,159
Mommy, Mommy!

5
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,482
Mommy!

6
00:00:09,482 --> 00:00:10,315
Mommy!

7
00:00:19,929 --> 00:00:21,925
- [Jared] Is that the mommy horse?

8
00:00:21,925 --> 00:00:24,002
- And that's the baby horse.

9
00:00:24,002 --> 00:00:25,348
- [Jared] Oh fun.

10
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:29,053
Are you guys playin' with those horses?

11
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:31,173
That is a baby horse.

12
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,192
Good morning, boys!

13
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:33,089
How did you sleep?

14
00:00:33,089 --> 00:00:34,189
- Good.

15
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:35,574
- [Jared] Good.

16
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:36,997
Calvin, what does a horse say?

17
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:38,344
- Neigh!

18
00:00:38,344 --> 00:00:39,975
- [Jared] Yeah, that's right.

19
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:42,791
- I have had a very slow start to my day.

20
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:47,354
It is 11:00 and I'm just
now like getting up.

21
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:49,920
I did get the kids dressed.

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,001
That is a bonus.

23
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:52,834
The kids are dressed.

24
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:54,082
Last night I woke up

25
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:55,956
and I was not feeling well.

26
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,665
And sometimes when you wake up,

27
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,584
and especially when you are pregnant,

28
00:00:59,584 --> 00:01:01,504
you can't go back to sleep until you eat

29
00:01:01,504 --> 00:01:04,030
because you're stomach
feels so gross and empty.

30
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,113
And I have my stand here.

31
00:01:07,453 --> 00:01:10,914
And this was full of nuts last night

32
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:12,059
and Jared brought it to bed.

33
00:01:12,059 --> 00:01:13,200
I was like, "Will you go get the nuts."

34
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,135
I like laid in bed.

35
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:15,358
Half of em spilled.

36
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:16,579
I just like shoved my mouth full

37
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:19,390
until I felt good enough
to go back to sleep.

38
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,325
Anyway, today is the last day

39
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:23,955
that Jared and I are going to be going

40
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:25,993
over the grant videos.

41
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:28,853
We've been trying to go over them,

42
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:29,790
or we have gone over them

43
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,359
at night when the kids have gone to bed.

44
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,436
And we haven't started
em until like 10:00.

45
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:35,904
We usually stay up until 1:00.

46
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:38,061
And then last we planned on doing it

47
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:39,228
and I crashed.

48
00:01:40,952 --> 00:01:42,585
And so, we're gonna do it today

49
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:43,481
and I've been a little worried like,

50
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,233
"What am I gonna do with the kids?"

51
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,168
It's Christmas break.

52
00:01:46,168 --> 00:01:47,185
I don't want to call babysitters.

53
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:49,307
And this morning Jared and I opened a lot

54
00:01:49,307 --> 00:01:51,179
of your guys' Christmas cards

55
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,218
and I loved seeing your families

56
00:01:53,218 --> 00:01:54,238
and your Christmas cards.

57
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:55,785
Thank you to everybody that sent one.

58
00:01:55,785 --> 00:01:57,822
And Nicole, she's awesome.

59
00:01:57,822 --> 00:01:59,939
She works at a Disney store

60
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,407
and she did not have to do this,

61
00:02:03,407 --> 00:02:05,445
but she sent the boys a Cars 3.

62
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:08,058
Like, this huge thing for the kids.

63
00:02:08,058 --> 00:02:10,012
And honestly, thank you, Nicole!

64
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,478
It like came at the perfect time.

65
00:02:11,478 --> 00:02:12,861
I kind of feel like tearing up a little

66
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:13,800
'cause I seriously was like,

67
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,698
"What am I gonna do today

68
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,778
while we go over these videos?"

69
00:02:16,778 --> 00:02:18,028
And the kids...

70
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,526
And the kids are gonna play with that

71
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:24,895
while we finish going over
our work stuff for that.

72
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:27,424
And I'm just a little
emotional cause I've been,

73
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:30,362
I just have felt bad
cause I feel like I want

74
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:32,928
to be with the kids
and do stuff with them.

75
00:02:32,928 --> 00:02:34,111
And even though I'm with them,

76
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,027
I just haven't quite had it in me

77
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,495
to do a ton of stuff.

78
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:41,085
So, I'm just feeling a
little guilt right now.

79
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:42,668
But, they're happy.

80
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:44,670
Like why am I boobin'?

81
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,811
Like, look at them.

82
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:47,074
(laughs)

83
00:02:47,074 --> 00:02:49,741
They're fine playing with those.

84
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:53,719
Anyways, it was a very,
very, very nice gesture.

85
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:54,552
So thank you, Nicole.

86
00:02:54,552 --> 00:02:55,428
You didn't have to do that.

87
00:02:55,428 --> 00:02:56,446
But it is gonna help us a lot.

88
00:02:56,446 --> 00:02:57,383
It'll keep them busy

89
00:02:57,383 --> 00:02:59,255
I'm hoping for a good hour

90
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,129
while we finish up the work that we need.

91
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:02,069
What are you building?

92
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:04,266
- I'm just making,

93
00:03:04,266 --> 00:03:06,016
I'm just building it.

94
00:03:09,111 --> 00:03:11,361
- Oh, you're doing so good.

95
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,251
Calvin used it for his horses.

96
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,973
What are you gonna put in yours?

97
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,847
- I'm not putting anything in it.

98
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:22,704
- You're just building it?

99
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:23,685
- Mhmm.

100
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:25,476
- Yeah, I don't know why I felt flustered

101
00:03:25,476 --> 00:03:27,470
a second ago 'cause I feel good now.

102
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,777
I think it was in the moment.

103
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:29,838
Jared missed that,

104
00:03:29,838 --> 00:03:31,588
that little meltdown.

105
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,676
I'm good now.

106
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:34,532
- I'm glad you're good.

107
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:36,412
You've taken your little melted puddle

108
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:38,407
and you've kind of
shaped yourself back up.

109
00:03:38,407 --> 00:03:40,035
You've folded yourself back into shape.

110
00:03:40,035 --> 00:03:40,868
Is that what you've done?

111
00:03:40,868 --> 00:03:41,701
- Ahhh!

112
00:03:42,892 --> 00:03:44,156
I'm good.

113
00:03:44,156 --> 00:03:45,218
- And Calvin has jewelry on.

114
00:03:45,218 --> 00:03:46,051
- Come here.

115
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,801
Come give me my ring.

116
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:50,572
Thank you.

117
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,430
Aww, thanks.

118
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,563
Let me see the hair band.

119
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,251
K, play with your horses.

120
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:00,918
Where's your horses?

121
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:05,658
- I hope you have been
following me on Instagram,

122
00:04:05,658 --> 00:04:07,660
specifically, my Instagram stories

123
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,210
because some magic has been happening

124
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,102
and I'm gonna show you the magic right now

125
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,269
between my Instagram story

126
00:04:15,649 --> 00:04:18,341
and Bonnie's Instagram story.

127
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,770
- [Bonnie] I see you Hickory Farms.

128
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:22,132
Lookin' all sexy over there.

129
00:04:22,132 --> 00:04:23,844
- Ellie, Ellie, Ellie, Ellie,

130
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:26,455
Bonnie just posted an
Instagram story of her

131
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:27,843
at the mall and she's
getting Hickory Farms

132
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,108
and we need to do that today immediately.

133
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:30,536
- Ah, Bonnie!

134
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:32,619
Why didn't you invite me?

135
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:33,452
- We need to go.

136
00:04:33,452 --> 00:04:35,763
Bonnie, Bonnie, save some
of it for us, please!

137
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:37,069
Save some for us!

138
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:37,967
- Jared, you better hurry up

139
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,171
because they are running out quickly.

140
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:42,292
I bought the last of this cheese.

141
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:44,857
They didn't have any
except in the gift package,

142
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:47,674
which I had to buy two
of just to get this.

143
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:48,855
So, hurry up, Jared.

144
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,117
Hashtag worth it!

145
00:04:50,117 --> 00:04:52,035
- Ellie, we gotta go!

146
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:53,012
We gotta go!

147
00:04:53,012 --> 00:04:54,642
- We're gonna go to Bonnie's house anyway

148
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:55,475
and eat snacks.

149
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,308
We'll eat hers.

150
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,596
- Oh, that's great!

151
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:00,104
And eat snacks!

152
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:01,653
- If you've never had Hickory Farms

153
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:02,550
during the holidays,

154
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,447
you are missing out.

155
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,280
It is the best.

156
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,113
It is amazing.

157
00:05:05,113 --> 00:05:06,956
It is nostalgic for me.

158
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:10,294
And Bonnie has what is
probably the last two

159
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:12,794
Hickory Farms packages in Utah

160
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,067
where we live.

161
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,509
And that means we probably
aren't going to be

162
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:22,206
getting any ourselves, unless
we sneak into their house

163
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,731
and get some for ourselves.

164
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:27,263
So, I think it is time to initiate

165
00:05:27,263 --> 00:05:28,647
operation mission mission

166
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:30,480
capture Hickory Farms.

167
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,618
I have parked a few
houses away from theirs

168
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:39,719
as to maintain no suspicion.

169
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:41,596
The clouds have enveloped around us

170
00:05:41,596 --> 00:05:43,595
and now it is snowing.

171
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,063
Now I make my approach.

172
00:05:45,063 --> 00:05:46,814
I pray that the snow
will make my footsteps

173
00:05:46,814 --> 00:05:48,774
all the lighter.

174
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:51,524
(dramatic music)

175
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,686
Okay, I'm in front the house.

176
00:05:54,686 --> 00:05:56,682
I don't think they've spotted me yet.

177
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,029
The question is,

178
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,196
"Can I get inside without
them seeing or hearing me?"

179
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,861
Okay, Bonnie's in the kitchen.

180
00:06:35,008 --> 00:06:37,258
(drumming)

181
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:44,367
(screaming)

182
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,307
- Ah, no, you got me!

183
00:06:46,307 --> 00:06:47,640
No, where is it?

184
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:51,601
Where is the Hickory Farms?

185
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:52,434
I need it!

186
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:57,025
You've disassembled it
all from its package.

187
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:57,858
- I know!

188
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,880
I have to like stash it and hide it

189
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,593
so nobody gets into it.

190
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,760
- Oh, my gosh.

191
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:04,939
It was a worthy effort.

192
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:06,975
I attempted, but I got caught.

193
00:07:06,975 --> 00:07:08,484
Can I have some Hickory Farms?

194
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:09,955
(laughs)

195
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,729
- These little guys just
got in from outside.

196
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:15,298
You can see their noses are still red.

197
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:16,646
How was outside?

198
00:07:16,646 --> 00:07:17,827
- Great.

199
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:18,660
- It was good?

200
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,493
It was great?

201
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:20,515
You're eatin' soup.

202
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,415
The one thing I did do today

203
00:07:23,415 --> 00:07:25,832
was I did make a pot of soup.

204
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:28,384
It is snowing.

205
00:07:28,384 --> 00:07:30,223
The kids did so good today

206
00:07:30,223 --> 00:07:32,259
while Jared and I worked.

207
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,197
What else?

208
00:07:33,197 --> 00:07:35,235
Calvin split his lip a little.

209
00:07:35,235 --> 00:07:36,152
Looks good.

210
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:39,353
Daddy went to go grab some band-aids.

211
00:07:39,353 --> 00:07:40,372
How's your soup?

212
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:41,205
- Good.

213
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:45,437
- Calvin, are eatin' it up?

214
00:07:45,437 --> 00:07:46,345
Here you go.

215
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,286
Here's another bite.

216
00:07:47,286 --> 00:07:48,453
- I have a surprise for you.

217
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,536
- What is it?

218
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,169
And there's me

219
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:55,200
and I still look the same at 5:00

220
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,361
as I did early, early this morning.

221
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,462
Jared and I are almost done.

222
00:08:00,462 --> 00:08:03,109
We spent several hours
going over the videos.

223
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:04,776
Totally fell asleep.

224
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,308
I am so grateful

225
00:08:07,308 --> 00:08:09,313
that I don't have a
huge headache right now,

226
00:08:09,313 --> 00:08:10,986
but I definitely can
tell that it would happen

227
00:08:10,986 --> 00:08:13,801
if I had a really busy day,

228
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:15,839
so I kind of have laid low.

229
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,099
I made some soup,

230
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,016
I vacuumed.

231
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:19,769
This is me.

232
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,019
Baby's growing.

233
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:25,252
Lots of hormonal stuff going on.

234
00:08:25,252 --> 00:08:26,926
I definitely feel changes today.

235
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:27,759
My stomach has hurt

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,617
and my back has hurt a lot today.

237
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:30,450
I'm on my phone

238
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,657
so it probably looks silly.

239
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:32,917
I laid down on the couch

240
00:08:32,917 --> 00:08:33,815
and I told Jared, I'm like,

241
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:34,956
"This is exactly how it feels

242
00:08:34,956 --> 00:08:36,424
when you start to miscarry."

243
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,912
Like, your back aches so bad

244
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:41,683
and then your front aches really bad.

245
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:44,293
And I've just had lots
of aches and pains today.

246
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,555
And I know it's just growing pains,

247
00:08:45,555 --> 00:08:48,445
but it makes me still
like, always worried.

248
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:50,896
But, I've had lots of pains today.

249
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:52,322
Now my head is starting to hurt.

250
00:08:52,322 --> 00:08:53,383
So that's my spiel.

251
00:08:53,383 --> 00:08:55,423
That's how we're doing today.

252
00:08:55,423 --> 00:08:57,505
- Poor little guy, Calvin,

253
00:08:57,505 --> 00:08:59,952
got a little, tiny owie above his lip

254
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:02,353
Right here when he was
playing with Jackson.

255
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:03,617
How's your lip?

256
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:04,472
Does it hurt?

257
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:06,019
Yeah?

258
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:07,814
Do you have medicine on it?

259
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:10,098
Is that gonna make it better?

260
00:09:10,098 --> 00:09:10,931
Yeah.

261
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:12,016
Are you tough?

262
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:14,016
Yeah, you're tough, huh?

263
00:09:16,535 --> 00:09:17,702
What was that?

264
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,442
Hey, we can't see!

265
00:09:21,442 --> 00:09:24,109
Turn the light on so we can see.

266
00:09:25,317 --> 00:09:26,150
(laughter)

267
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,983
I know just what to do.

268
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:27,816
Oh, there we go.

269
00:09:27,816 --> 00:09:28,649
Thanks, Jackson.

270
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,618
Hey, do you want to know

271
00:09:30,618 --> 00:09:31,964
what was so sweet?

272
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:35,145
Jackson, as soon as Calvin got hurt,

273
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:37,631
Jackson was so loving
and tender and careful

274
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,872
wanted to get him a band-aid right away

275
00:09:39,872 --> 00:09:43,702
because you are just a
caring, loving brother.

276
00:09:43,702 --> 00:09:44,535
- I'm a geni.

277
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:46,067
- You're a geni, yeah.

278
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:47,005
- No, I'm the boss.

279
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:47,838
- You're the boss?

280
00:09:47,838 --> 00:09:48,961
Are you the boss baby?

281
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:50,551
- No.

282
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:51,384
- Just the boss?

283
00:09:51,384 --> 00:09:54,589
While we were trying to
get Calvin taken care of

284
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,483
Jackson was just so tender
and sweet and was asking,

285
00:09:57,483 --> 00:09:58,746
"You okay, Calvin?

286
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,132
"Do you want me to get you a band-aid?"

287
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,664
Did Jackson get you a band-aid?

288
00:10:02,664 --> 00:10:03,517
Yeah, he did, huh?

289
00:10:03,517 --> 00:10:04,700
He was very sweet to do that.

290
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,207
It's just cool to see these two interact

291
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,205
with each other and care for each other

292
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,918
and love each other.

293
00:10:09,918 --> 00:10:12,244
Like, Jackson's primary concern,

294
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:14,933
at the moment, was making
sure Calvin was okay.

295
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,114
And I love that.

296
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:17,746
You'll just have a mustache
on for a little bit.

297
00:10:17,746 --> 00:10:19,536
You can grow one better
than Dad in the meantime.

298
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,410
And in no time at all, you'll be better.

299
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,243
Okay?

300
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:23,076
- By the time this video is live,

301
00:10:23,076 --> 00:10:24,062
you guys will already known who won

302
00:10:24,062 --> 00:10:25,312
the IVF grants.

303
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:28,095
I still am in my jammies.

304
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:29,601
This is not like me

305
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:31,066
and you guys know that.

306
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:32,817
I just cut up a bunch of--

307
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:33,650
- [Jared] Heaven.

308
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,772
- Yes, heaven.

309
00:10:34,772 --> 00:10:35,871
We'll just say that.

310
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:37,827
Cut those bad boys up.

311
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:38,766
We're gonna sit down.

312
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:40,560
It is now 6:00.

313
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,027
We really have shown you

314
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:43,539
pretty much what we've been doing all day.

315
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:45,858
I am unbelievably proud of the kids

316
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:49,647
because we've had to do
this all during the day

317
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:51,443
and they've been really good just to play.

318
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,465
- They have been playing
so good and so hard.

319
00:10:54,465 --> 00:10:58,026
- So hard that Calvin split his lip open.

320
00:10:58,026 --> 00:10:59,777
It's not too bad, but...

321
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:04,099
- What I'm proud about is
how he's been handling it.

322
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:04,994
Like, he cried for a second

323
00:11:04,994 --> 00:11:06,011
but then he's just like,

324
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,452
"I really would just like
to go play in the snow, Mom.

325
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:09,947
Can I go play in the snow?"

326
00:11:09,947 --> 00:11:10,780
- Yeah, I know.

327
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,613
It was cute.

328
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:12,446
They played in the snow.

329
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:14,484
So we are just wrapping
up here for the night.

330
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:18,567
Lots of emotions this week
for everybody involved

331
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,376
so, let's get goin'.

332
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,680
- I think one of the easiest parts

333
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,843
about doing this IVF grant contest

334
00:11:24,843 --> 00:11:28,928
is that everyone who applies
is deserving of a grant.

335
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,561
Like, that's like the easiest part.

336
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:33,820
But, the hardest part is
that everyone who applies

337
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,104
is so deserving of a grant

338
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:38,715
and that's what makes this so hard.

339
00:11:38,715 --> 00:11:43,203
Is that we only have so
many to give right now.

340
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,532
And it's just difficult,

341
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:48,064
and so I've taken a minute
to just come outside

342
00:11:48,064 --> 00:11:52,023
and just think and just
be with my thoughts.

343
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:52,856
And...

344
00:11:53,896 --> 00:11:55,201
Literally pray

345
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:58,118
and to have the guidance to decide.

346
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:04,383
It's tough, but the best part is,

347
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:06,383
no matter who we choose,

348
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,890
they are so deserving.

349
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:12,537
And it just makes it so easy.

350
00:12:12,537 --> 00:12:14,375
No matter what decision we make,

351
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,841
it's a good decision.

352
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:16,674
You know what I mean?

353
00:12:16,674 --> 00:12:18,777
Like, it's hard to explain with the words,

354
00:12:18,777 --> 00:12:20,933
but it makes sense in my head.

355
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:24,107
I think what I'm gonna do
now is plow the driveway

356
00:12:24,107 --> 00:12:25,899
and just be in my thoughts for a minute.

357
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:28,267
We got about four inches
of snow it looks like.

358
00:12:28,267 --> 00:12:29,533
Got a bunch of snow

359
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,366
and so we're gonna plow that.

360
00:12:31,366 --> 00:12:34,710
And just take some time
and think about these

361
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,629
last videos that we've been going through.

362
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:41,379
(peaceful music)

363
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:53,113
It's been an extremely emotional week

364
00:12:53,113 --> 00:12:57,158
in a good way, but in a
heart-breaking way too.

365
00:12:57,158 --> 00:13:00,172
Ellie and I have
literally watched hundreds

366
00:13:00,172 --> 00:13:03,472
upon hundreds of infertility journeys,

367
00:13:03,472 --> 00:13:07,472
but the one thing I saw
more than ever was hope.

368
00:13:08,783 --> 00:13:11,783
So many of you have such strong hope

369
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,233
and that is what is so cool

370
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,356
about the infertility community

371
00:13:17,356 --> 00:13:19,843
is that we never give up.

372
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:23,058
And, we go through all of these things

373
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:24,523
and we never give up.

374
00:13:24,523 --> 00:13:27,251
