1
00:00:00,224 --> 00:00:01,791
- Whoo, whoo, whoo.

2
00:00:01,791 --> 00:00:02,890
Let's get into this.

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,439
- We've never done a Q and A like this.

4
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:08,202
- No, it's going to be right.

5
00:00:08,202 --> 00:00:09,193
It's going to be honest.

6
00:00:09,193 --> 00:00:11,943
It's going to be different, deep.

7
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,728
It's all about
relationships, and marriage.

8
00:00:15,728 --> 00:00:18,116
There's so much that we can go into.

9
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:20,158
- And there's so much
that we're still learning.

10
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:21,431
- We gotta get some
things on the table first.

11
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,105
- No one's perfect, so I think that,

12
00:00:23,105 --> 00:00:25,655
that's just a disclaimer,
like we're not doing this,

13
00:00:25,655 --> 00:00:27,159
because it's like we
have a great marriage.

14
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:28,563
We're going to talk to you about advice.

15
00:00:28,563 --> 00:00:31,422
We're doing this because a lot
of people ask us questions,

16
00:00:31,422 --> 00:00:34,298
and this would be a good
opportunity for Jared and I

17
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,567
to share some things that work,

18
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:37,039
and maybe talk about a few things

19
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:38,638
that we get flustered with.

20
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:39,471
- Absolutely.

21
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:42,001
There are gonna be some
things that we're not good at,

22
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,465
some things that you're great at,

23
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:46,583
some things that you could
learn some things from.

24
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:48,855
You know, everything has to
be taken with a grain of salt.

25
00:00:48,855 --> 00:00:51,797
It may not work for you,
it may not work for us,

26
00:00:51,797 --> 00:00:53,121
and vice versa.

27
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:56,038
So, I went through 1,400 questions.

28
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,521
(Ellie squeals)

29
00:00:58,521 --> 00:00:59,714
I went through all of them,

30
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:02,501
and a lot of them had
some very similar themes.

31
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:04,753
So I took those questions,
and we're gonna be trying

32
00:01:04,753 --> 00:01:06,569
to go through some of those things,

33
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,037
but they all blend together.

34
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:11,006
So this is gonna be more
of like a conversation,

35
00:01:11,006 --> 00:01:13,920
while we're answering some questions too.

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,753
Should we get to it?

37
00:01:14,753 --> 00:01:15,586
- Yes.

38
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:16,800
- Just so we're clear, I think this

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,763
is kind of more like a podcast feel,

40
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:21,176
and so this might be a longer video.

41
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:24,721
So, grab a snack and a
video, let's go for a ride.

42
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:26,050
- Go to the bathroom real quick.

43
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,519
- I feel like we should kiss beforehand,

44
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:29,939
because this is a relationship
video, so maybe...

45
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,078
- We actually just did, now he
wants to do it for you guys.

46
00:01:33,078 --> 00:01:37,153
- I just like to kiss you (lips smack).

47
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:40,132
First question, "If you could
give one piece of advice

48
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,710
"to a newlywed couple, what would it be?"

49
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,001
I have advice that I give all the time.

50
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,634
Do you have anything that you would--

51
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:47,467
- I'll let you go first.

52
00:01:47,467 --> 00:01:50,237
- It's advice that I
have been given before,

53
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:53,519
and I've kind of carried it with me.

54
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:58,183
It's that selflessness is
the key to a happy marriage,

55
00:01:58,183 --> 00:02:00,007
and it's a two-way street.

56
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:02,698
If you and your partner are both selfless,

57
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:06,325
thinking of each other
first, then the happiness

58
00:02:06,325 --> 00:02:08,222
that you're giving, is also the happiness

59
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,077
that you're receiving.

60
00:02:10,077 --> 00:02:11,284
- 'Cause you're both giving.

61
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,544
- Yeah, exactly.

62
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:15,877
But, if one person stops being selfless,

63
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:19,993
then it's broken, so it's hard,

64
00:02:19,993 --> 00:02:22,309
but once you have that, it works.

65
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,231
- That's a natural.

66
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,098
It's natural to be like, "Oh, I need help.

67
00:02:26,098 --> 00:02:27,731
"I need help doing this."

68
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,740
Kind of be a little selfish one day,

69
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,543
and so it's always good to go back.

70
00:02:32,543 --> 00:02:34,203
That's why you always have sit downs,

71
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:35,682
that's why you talk.

72
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,512
Maybe that's why you pray.

73
00:02:37,512 --> 00:02:38,529
I love that advice.

74
00:02:38,529 --> 00:02:42,457
- I think serving your spouse
is one of the best ways

75
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:45,384
that you can show affection and love,

76
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:47,042
and that's something I have to work on.

77
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,173
Would you agree?

78
00:02:48,173 --> 00:02:51,273
- We are continually,
every day, every day,

79
00:02:51,273 --> 00:02:54,195
and we'll do that for
the rest of our lives,

80
00:02:54,195 --> 00:02:55,611
until we die, we will.

81
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,713
I would say my piece of
advice for a newlywed person,

82
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,665
and I'm telling myself this.

83
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:04,556
If I were to go back eight
years, and give myself advice,

84
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:07,473
I would say, before we got married,

85
00:03:08,835 --> 00:03:12,002
to detail talk about finances and sex.

86
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,408
That's what I wish we
would have done more.

87
00:03:16,408 --> 00:03:18,934
We did talk about that, not a lot,

88
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:22,049
but I wish we would have even more.

89
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:23,744
- I totally agree, because--

90
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:25,244
- What you expect,

91
00:03:27,185 --> 00:03:29,572
how do you do your finances?

92
00:03:29,572 --> 00:03:31,534
Are you okay having credit cards?

93
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,460
You know, that kind of
stuff, just everything.

94
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,222
- We found that a lot of
arguments in marriages

95
00:03:36,222 --> 00:03:39,139
come down to finances and intimacy.

96
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:42,278
Being on the same page with those things--

97
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:44,377
- Expectations, everything.

98
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:46,330
- Can solve a lot of arguments.

99
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,888
"Did you have any serious
relationships before each other?"

100
00:03:48,888 --> 00:03:51,255
For me, I would say I have.

101
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:52,712
- We're like (squeals).

102
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:55,409
- I definitely didn't have as serious.

103
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:58,670
I dated, but none of the
people that I were dating,

104
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,520
I was considering marriage.

105
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,317
- The month before Jared
and I really, really,

106
00:04:05,317 --> 00:04:09,425
knew we liked each other, we
actually texted quite a bit.

107
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:10,470
- It was November, right?

108
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,232
- That month Jared and
I had stopped calling,

109
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:15,141
stopped texting.

110
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,015
It wasn't like we were upset of anything,

111
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,010
we just did it.

112
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,875
I was still in school, and so I just knew,

113
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:26,390
he's just like doing his
thing, I'm doing mine.

114
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,002
Jared actually took that month off.

115
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,447
I didn't know this until we had talked

116
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:31,947
after we officially hooked up,

117
00:04:33,094 --> 00:04:35,668
but Jared took that month
off because he thought,

118
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:36,965
I really like Ellie.

119
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:40,012
I need to go a path, tell my friend Ron,

120
00:04:40,012 --> 00:04:43,797
and I want to make sure
that there is no feelings

121
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,868
or relationship with this other person.

122
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:47,925
So he took that month off to try and see

123
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:50,164
if there was anything
there with that person.

124
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,670
- Yeah, I needed to make
sure that the feelings

125
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,499
that I had for Ellie were...

126
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:55,871
- Real.

127
00:04:55,871 --> 00:04:59,938
- Wasn't the direct
focus, my main intention,

128
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,761
and they were.

129
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,139
- I'm so glad you did that.

130
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,036
That was good.

131
00:05:05,036 --> 00:05:07,105
What were we talking about?

132
00:05:07,105 --> 00:05:09,688
- Serious relationships before.

133
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:14,706
- Serious relationships,
I dated a few people

134
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,452
that I felt like I really liked,

135
00:05:18,452 --> 00:05:21,673
but as far as a serious relationship,

136
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:25,875
like possible marriage, I
would say there was one,

137
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:27,125
where he was...

138
00:05:29,085 --> 00:05:30,103
This is hard, 'cause I was in high school,

139
00:05:30,103 --> 00:05:33,445
so sounds so crazy, but it was.

140
00:05:33,445 --> 00:05:36,080
When you say that, it
sounds kind of weird to me,

141
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,363
but at the time it didn't--

142
00:05:37,363 --> 00:05:38,688
- It wasn't weird.

143
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:43,005
I would say I had a serious
relationship before Jared.

144
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:45,752
- "What are your favorite
budget night ideas,

145
00:05:45,752 --> 00:05:47,422
"or your favorite date night in,

146
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:48,778
"when you don't have a babysitter?"

147
00:05:48,778 --> 00:05:51,445
- We do a lot of date night ins.

148
00:05:52,364 --> 00:05:53,776
Well I guess I don't know.

149
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:56,518
I don't feel like we get
babysitters the whole ton.

150
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,967
If we get 'em, it's actually
usually for lunch dates.

151
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,963
I really enjoy doing
that, more so than dinner,

152
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:04,263
because we like putting the kids to bed.

153
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,819
- Obviously, we like watching
our shows and everything,

154
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:08,608
but when I think of a date night,

155
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:11,088
and I kind of think the whole family.

156
00:06:11,088 --> 00:06:12,999
Making a blanket for, and watching a movie

157
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,221
is my favorite thing to do with the kids.

158
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,824
- Even though Jared and I do this often,

159
00:06:16,824 --> 00:06:18,806
it really is a date to us.

160
00:06:18,806 --> 00:06:20,444
We always get a drink, and a snack,

161
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:22,196
and we take a bath together.

162
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:25,376
That really is a time that we just sit,

163
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:27,299
we talk about whatever we want,

164
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:30,380
and we often try not to
talk about work or kids.

165
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,804
It's like we're just
talking about us in the tub,

166
00:06:32,804 --> 00:06:35,778
and how we're feeling,
and what's going on.

167
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:36,804
It's like at date.

168
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:40,304
- It is like a date, 'cause it's intimate,

169
00:06:41,406 --> 00:06:45,810
it's alone time, and you're
focusing on each other.

170
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,171
I think that's kind of
the whole point of that,

171
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:52,338
is to converse, and to have
a check in with your spouse.

172
00:06:53,402 --> 00:06:57,077
That's always something that
we enjoy is conversations.

173
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:59,526
"Did the infertility issues
ever put a damper or stress

174
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:03,613
"on your relationship, or did
it only make you stronger?"

175
00:07:03,613 --> 00:07:07,120
- That could go either (laughs).

176
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,709
- You tooted, it's okay.

177
00:07:09,709 --> 00:07:11,131
Real quick, to answer the question,

178
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:12,704
who's the sneaky one in the relationship?

179
00:07:12,704 --> 00:07:14,310
It's her.

180
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,776
(Ellie and Jared laugh)

181
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,379
- Well everyone already knows us.

182
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,532
- That's common knowledge.

183
00:07:18,532 --> 00:07:19,623
- That question could definitely

184
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:21,861
go a few different directions.

185
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:26,191
I would say it definitely made
our relationship stronger.

186
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:30,416
It definitely put a huge,
huge toll and stress

187
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,740
on our private intimate life.

188
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,266
- Yeah, absolutely.

189
00:07:34,266 --> 00:07:38,433
- Absolutely, just not
fun, forced, just (gags).

190
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,528
Infertility issues, medication, timing,

191
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:45,286
it's not fun.

192
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:46,119
- I think--

193
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,570
- Mentally, physically.

194
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,151
- I think one of things that it did do,

195
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:53,919
is it made us realize that
we both handle stressful

196
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,844
situations, and grieving, differently.

197
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:00,532
Sometimes that can be hard

198
00:08:00,532 --> 00:08:02,351
for the other person to understand,

199
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,223
is that when you grieve,
or when you stress,

200
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:07,168
you handle those situations differently.

201
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:08,893
- Even with the miscarriages.

202
00:08:08,893 --> 00:08:10,636
- Yeah, especially with that stuff,

203
00:08:10,636 --> 00:08:14,803
'cause, I mean, that's the
hardest stuff, is the loss.

204
00:08:16,716 --> 00:08:19,335
- We definitely handle thing differently.

205
00:08:19,335 --> 00:08:23,467
- I feel like we are together,
stronger, because of it.

206
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:24,429
- Oh, totally.

207
00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:27,296
Our relationship is stronger,

208
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:28,766
but there's a whole other side.

209
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:32,318
There's your relationship,
and there's your intimacy,

210
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:35,743
and it totally can affect both of those.

211
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:37,462
I mean it made some things difficult,

212
00:08:37,462 --> 00:08:41,401
but I don't know if it ever
put a huge damper on things.

213
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:44,284
I mean, this was a problem
that we had to go through.

214
00:08:44,284 --> 00:08:45,931
- It did tear us apart.

215
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:48,651
- Yeah, but I mean there
was definitely like,

216
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:51,254
"This sucks, let's do this together."

217
00:08:51,254 --> 00:08:56,036
- I've read several forums
on the infertility pages,

218
00:08:56,036 --> 00:09:00,174
and a lot of women are on
there that are having the issue

219
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:04,583
that it's like, "My husband
just doesn't even get it."

220
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:08,544
Like me and you luckily didn't have that,

221
00:09:08,544 --> 00:09:13,089
so there is so many different
paths that can go down.

222
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,528
- "How do you guys have time
to be romantic with two kids?"

223
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:17,369
Why don't you take this one.

224
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:19,529
- What, I feel like
I've been talking a lot.

225
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:20,596
- I've been talking a lot too.

226
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:21,525
(Ellie laughs)

227
00:09:21,525 --> 00:09:22,375
You start and I'll--

228
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:26,190
- "How do you have time to
be romantic with two kids?"

229
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,002
Kids watch a movie and have some popcorn.

230
00:09:29,002 --> 00:09:31,431
Don't bother us for 20 minutes.

231
00:09:31,431 --> 00:09:32,442
That we do a lot.

232
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,973
- That's one way for sure.

233
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:36,634
Honestly, I feel like with our kids

234
00:09:36,634 --> 00:09:39,575
at the age that they are,
it's relatively easy.

235
00:09:39,575 --> 00:09:42,948
I mean, the kids bedtime is
between seven and eight p.m.,

236
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:45,628
which is kind of like prime time for us,

237
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,064
so it's easy right now.

238
00:09:48,064 --> 00:09:49,223
I imagine when the kids get older,

239
00:09:49,223 --> 00:09:51,215
it's gonna be more difficult.

240
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,454
- To have our alone time.

241
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:56,114
- Yeah, but also they're
going to be doing more things.

242
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:57,663
- "Have you guys ever been in a argument,

243
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,947
"and couldn't resolve the
issue over a couple of days,

244
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,802
"and what what the hardest
decision you guys have ever made

245
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,453
"while being married?"

246
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,744
As far as arguments over a couple of days,

247
00:10:07,744 --> 00:10:11,586
Jared and I, we really
think it's important

248
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:15,336
that, that is so toxic,
and bad, to be angry,

249
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,972
especially for multiple days.

250
00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,387
- Especially, just even over night.

251
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,234
- Not everybody is like this.

252
00:10:22,234 --> 00:10:24,734
Not both spouses are more open

253
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:28,964
to just talking it out,

254
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:33,131
and that's okay, if that is
now how you handle stress,

255
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:36,813
or how you handle the relationship,

256
00:10:36,813 --> 00:10:39,311
you do what's best for you.

257
00:10:39,311 --> 00:10:41,755
The one night we were upset,

258
00:10:41,755 --> 00:10:43,535
and I went and slept on the couch,

259
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:46,397
it was the only night
we've ever done that.

260
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,113
20 minutes later Jared came
out with a pillow and blanket,

261
00:10:49,113 --> 00:10:50,310
and laid on the floor, and he said,

262
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,549
"I didn't marry you to
not sleep with you."

263
00:10:54,549 --> 00:10:56,230
We just talked our argument out.

264
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,240
I don't even remember what it was,

265
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,731
and went back to bed together.

266
00:10:58,731 --> 00:11:02,674
Ever since then, we've never slept apart.

267
00:11:02,674 --> 00:11:05,304
We really, really feel it's
important that we don't

268
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:09,180
be angry for multiple
days, because I love you.

269
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,637
I need you.

270
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,654
- We're a team.

271
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:14,887
- I get angry, and sometimes we argue,

272
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:18,237
and sometimes the argument
lasts a half a day,

273
00:11:18,237 --> 00:11:20,207
or almost a full day, where it's like,

274
00:11:20,207 --> 00:11:23,803
we are just so annoyed,
I can't even look at you.

275
00:11:23,803 --> 00:11:27,611
It's like, we have those but we definitely

276
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:29,528
do not go to bed angry.

277
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,714
I know it just has happened that way.

278
00:11:34,714 --> 00:11:36,614
It's worked out that way.

279
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:39,250
- It's something I can't have.

280
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,474
I personally, it's like--

281
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:42,842
- You don't like contention.

282
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:43,675
- Well I don't.

283
00:11:43,675 --> 00:11:45,686
I don't like things dragging on.

284
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:48,616
I like to resolve situations quickly,

285
00:11:48,616 --> 00:11:51,317
and almost to a fault sometimes,

286
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:53,961
it's just like, "Okay, whatever."

287
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:57,854
- To stretch on this topic,
because you said that,

288
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:01,273
Jared does like to
resolve issues right away.

289
00:12:01,273 --> 00:12:05,440
That has actually made us
sometimes argue a little bit more.

290
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,578
- Like I said, to a fault sometimes.

291
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:11,885
- Maybe to inform you a little
bit more like situations

292
00:12:11,885 --> 00:12:15,294
is Jared does want to
resolve right then and there.

293
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:19,187
There are times when I am so on fire,

294
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:22,886
and it's like, okay I need
to sit in my own bubble

295
00:12:22,886 --> 00:12:26,203
for just one second, and I
need to calm myself down,

296
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:28,588
before I'm able to even talk it out.

297
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:29,856
There's been a few
times when Jared's like,

298
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:31,007
"No, let's talk about it."

299
00:12:31,007 --> 00:12:32,323
I'm like, "No, no, no."

300
00:12:32,323 --> 00:12:33,854
- Ellie's like, "I need space!"

301
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:34,746
- Oh totally.

302
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:37,068
I'm like, "No, give me five minutes.

303
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:38,120
"I just need five minutes."

304
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,669
Just so I don't say anything stupid.

305
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,373
Just so I don't do anything stupid.

306
00:12:42,373 --> 00:12:45,692
Just so I can just kind of think of--

307
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:46,525
- Process.

308
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:47,411
- Yeah, process stuff.

309
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,748
So even though we do resolve things fast,

310
00:12:50,748 --> 00:12:52,339
there are times where it's like

311
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,661
I flippin need a break though
for just a minute (laughs).

312
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,786
- And that's totally, totally true.

313
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:01,692
Every person will handle
a situation differently,

314
00:13:01,692 --> 00:13:03,576
but I think, and we kind
of talked about this

315
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,357
today at lunch.

316
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:08,430
I feel like a lot of
arguments that are had,

317
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,827
are because of almost like egos,

318
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,558
and I'm not pointing fingers at anyone.

319
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:16,151
This is just something that I feel.

320
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,563
- I will point a finger (chuckles).

321
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:21,045
- I don't know, but I
feel like both people

322
00:13:21,045 --> 00:13:25,212
want to be right, and that
is the cause of the argument.

323
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:27,643
- Most of 'em.

324
00:13:27,643 --> 00:13:30,122
- Yeah, but a lot of
the times the argument

325
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:33,312
is so irrelevant to the situation,

326
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:36,321
that the argument is
more about who is right,

327
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:40,070
rather than solving the issue, compromise.

328
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:40,903
- Totally.

329
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,982
- I mean, some of our arguments have been

330
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:44,769
over the dumbest things.

331
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:47,321
- that we can't even
remember, 'cause it's dumb.

332
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:49,241
- The reason for the
argument we can't remember,

333
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,588
but we remember the argument itself.

334
00:13:51,588 --> 00:13:52,933
A lot of times it just doesn't matter.

335
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:55,405
It's just like check
your egos at the door,

336
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:56,704
and remember that you're a team,

337
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:58,652
and remember that you're working together.

338
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,551
Remember that you have
to move forward together.

339
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,157
I feel like if we do that,

340
00:14:03,157 --> 00:14:07,367
that itself helps solve
a lot of arguments.

341
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:11,331
- Jared is, and I give him this fully.

342
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:14,414
He has helped me, is Jared is amazing

343
00:14:15,624 --> 00:14:18,457
at taking himself out of the picture

344
00:14:18,457 --> 00:14:21,487
and looking at everybody's perspective.

345
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:24,316
He does this in every situation,

346
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:25,547
and there's been a few
times where I'm like,

347
00:14:25,547 --> 00:14:27,289
"You don't need to be doing that.

348
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:28,552
"Why are you helping them?

349
00:14:28,552 --> 00:14:30,265
"They've been so mean to you."

350
00:14:30,265 --> 00:14:31,847
- Think about mean, think about you.

351
00:14:31,847 --> 00:14:33,283
- Yeah, and there have
been times where I'm like,

352
00:14:33,283 --> 00:14:36,075
"Excuse me, I'm right here."

353
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,357
He really is good to be like, "Well look,"

354
00:14:38,357 --> 00:14:40,861
and he talks about their situation,

355
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:44,432
how they could be feeling,
me and my situation, him.

356
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:47,941
He is so good to look at everyone right.

357
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:52,162
I am not that way at all, and
I'm slowly becoming better,

358
00:14:52,162 --> 00:14:53,454
but I'm not that way.

359
00:14:53,454 --> 00:14:55,123
- Well that's why we make a good team.

360
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,546
- We do, we make a good team.

361
00:14:56,546 --> 00:15:00,645
Jared is really good to look
at everybody's scenario,

362
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:04,251
and I feel like that could
help a lot of family,

363
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:08,388
friendships, just be like,
okay, there is conflict,

364
00:15:08,388 --> 00:15:09,562
but look at their side too.

365
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:13,739
Even if they're wrong, look
at their side for a second,

366
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,883
and just see where maybe
they could be coming from.

367
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:18,096
- Why and where they're
coming from, exactly.

368
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:20,326
- Why are you good?

369
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:22,401
I'm not good (laughs).

370
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:23,868
- There we go.

371
00:15:23,868 --> 00:15:25,902
- He really is, and I give Jared--

372
00:15:25,902 --> 00:15:26,816
- Thank you.

373
00:15:26,816 --> 00:15:29,019
- I give Jared 30 high fives.

374
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:31,609
- Well, I want to give you one kiss.

375
00:15:31,609 --> 00:15:33,721
"Tell us more about your date with Julie."

376
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:36,263
Okay, so we say we went on
a date, it really wasn't.

377
00:15:36,263 --> 00:15:37,591
- It was a date.

378
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:39,654
- It was a date, but it wasn't like

379
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:42,081
I'm gonna ask Julie on a
date, and I'm gonna take her--

380
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:43,115
- Yes, it was a planned date.

381
00:15:43,115 --> 00:15:45,365
- Landon and Julie were
going to a concert,

382
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:47,949
and he didn't realize that
he had family pictures.

383
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,429
He had just gotten off his
church mission after two years,

384
00:15:51,429 --> 00:15:53,971
so he went to go do family pictures,

385
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:55,003
and he was like,

386
00:15:55,003 --> 00:15:56,714
"Well we're gonna be
hanging out afterwards.

387
00:15:56,714 --> 00:15:59,736
"Anyway, why don't you and
Julie go to this concert."

388
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:03,742
Which was like on college
campus, it was in the afternoon.

389
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:08,623
Julie and I went to this
concert, and we just had fun.

390
00:16:08,623 --> 00:16:10,623
It was Ryan Shupe and the Rubberband.

391
00:16:10,623 --> 00:16:14,208
- So, it wasn't like a date,
but it was like they hung out.

392
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:17,291
- But, I will say, we did hold hands.

393
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:19,620
- To be cute.

394
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,546
- Just to say, we're like,
"Wouldn't it be funny if..."

395
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,595
Just like as a joke to Landon.

396
00:16:25,595 --> 00:16:26,428
That's it.

397
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:27,261
- It was fun.

398
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:29,360
- It was fun.
- Fun and games.

399
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,223
- Julie and I were born in the same year,

400
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:34,239
so we graduated in the same year.

401
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:38,346
"Do you truly think there's
someone out there for everyone?"

402
00:16:38,346 --> 00:16:42,346
I think that there's not
one person for someone.

403
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:46,102
I feel like you could be married

404
00:16:46,102 --> 00:16:47,429
to a lot of different people,

405
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:49,698
but we just probably don't meet them

406
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:51,672
and develop relationships with them.

407
00:16:51,672 --> 00:16:53,640
Do you know what I mean?

408
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,034
- Are you reading my mind?

409
00:16:55,034 --> 00:16:57,542
I remember my dad telling me this,

410
00:16:57,542 --> 00:16:58,981
so I don't know if I think this

411
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:01,237
because I've heard it a
few times from my dad,

412
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:03,247
or if it's 'cause I think it.

413
00:17:03,247 --> 00:17:05,678
I believe I believe it as well,

414
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,911
but I remember my dad saying,

415
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:09,815
"You can love everyone.

416
00:17:09,815 --> 00:17:13,260
"You can choose to love someone."

417
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:17,417
So I don't feel like there
is your soulmate out there.

418
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:20,415
I feel like if someone
is willing to love you,

419
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,459
and you're willing to love
them, that you can make it work.

420
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,292
Do you know what I mean?

421
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:25,125
- Yeah, I think so.

422
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:29,066
I definitely think that
there's compatibility.

423
00:17:29,066 --> 00:17:31,050
You're more compatible with a few people

424
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,897
than you are with a lot of people.

425
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,107
So while it may not be like,

426
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:36,232
oh you could marry anyone in the world.

427
00:17:36,232 --> 00:17:39,679
No, it's like maybe you have
this group of compatibility,

428
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,999
but I don't think you have one soulmate,

429
00:17:41,999 --> 00:17:45,329
and if you don't find that one
soulmate you're in trouble.

430
00:17:45,329 --> 00:17:46,222
That's what I mean.

431
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:49,747
- I agree, so Amen (laughs).

432
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:50,928
- I think Ellie's pretty great.

433
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:52,546
- But I do believe you
can choose to love people.

434
00:17:52,546 --> 00:17:53,503
- Absolutely.

435
00:17:53,503 --> 00:17:58,391
- Even not in deep love, but
even like grocery stores,

436
00:17:58,391 --> 00:18:01,308
or out an about, you can
choose to like people.

437
00:18:01,308 --> 00:18:02,471
You can choose to be nice.

438
00:18:02,471 --> 00:18:04,296
You can choose to love someone.

439
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:07,856
- It's a fun game to try and
find something that you like

440
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:10,758
about a complete stranger
without going up to them,

441
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,450
without knowing them.

442
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,737
Find one thing that
you like about someone.

443
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:17,504
I challenge you right now, like (mumbles).

444
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:18,476
What do you love about me?

445
00:18:18,476 --> 00:18:19,309
Tell me.

446
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:20,773
Name three things you like about me.

447
00:18:20,773 --> 00:18:21,717
- I like your blue eyes.

448
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:22,550
- Thanks.

449
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:25,474
- I like how nice you are to people.

450
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:26,981
I like that you rub my back at night.

451
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,331
- "What is the main core of
having a healthy marriage?"

452
00:18:30,331 --> 00:18:32,191
- This is so hard.

453
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,470
- I mean, four cores and
seven years ago, no I--

454
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,471
- "What is the main core of
having a healthy marriage?"

455
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,256
- I think there's so many
different things to it,

456
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:43,248
but if I were to think
of like in Jared's book,

457
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:46,235
what goes into a good healthy marriage?

458
00:18:46,235 --> 00:18:47,481
- We're basing this on us.

459
00:18:47,481 --> 00:18:48,693
- Yeah, and we're not perfect.

460
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,314
- Not advice to people.

461
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:54,693
So this more like, this
is what's healthy for us.

462
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,356
- In our marriage what do
you think has been the best?

463
00:18:58,356 --> 00:18:59,523
Communication?

464
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,112
We're doing a good job of
communicating right now.

465
00:19:03,112 --> 00:19:05,001
- We don't know what it is.

466
00:19:05,001 --> 00:19:08,958
I feel like with Jared and I,
the reason things go as smooth

467
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:12,429
as they have been is because our main core

468
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:16,797
has been we believe the
same things with God.

469
00:19:16,797 --> 00:19:18,753
- Our morals are in line.

470
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:20,930
- I feel like it just comes down to

471
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:25,627
we believe there's a God,
and if we hold tight to him

472
00:19:25,627 --> 00:19:28,769
and each other, things will work out.

473
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,602
- Absolutely.

474
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:32,910
- I feel like that's what's
helped me and you the most.

475
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,039
- Religion is a huge part of
our life and our marriage.

476
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,759
We haven't dove into
that a ton, but you know,

477
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,768
a lot of people know what we believe,

478
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,394
and it is part of it.

479
00:19:43,394 --> 00:19:45,660
We believe that families
are together forever,

480
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,993
and that's a huge part about our family,

481
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:53,077
siblings, and the extended family,

482
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:55,607
and us, and our family with our kids.

483
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:59,476
Those moral values are a huge part to us.

484
00:19:59,476 --> 00:20:02,143
- That is why we are who we are.

485
00:20:03,255 --> 00:20:04,088
- Absolutely.

486
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:05,505
- It's in our blood in a way.

487
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,934
It's like, it's just a way of life for us.

488
00:20:08,934 --> 00:20:13,101
- I think wanting to be
better people for our spouse,

489
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:16,206
like I want to be a better person for you

490
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:18,444
is another thing too.

491
00:20:18,444 --> 00:20:20,437
I want to constantly improve myself,

492
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:24,060
so our marriage is better
is another thing, you know.

493
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,665
- Yes, I love that, and
I think that's very true.

494
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:27,729
You do that.

495
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:29,713
- You do, you boo.

496
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:33,747
- Oh, Aspen over, "Do you
like to touch Ellie's butt?"

497
00:20:33,747 --> 00:20:35,636
Well if see in our Amazon video,

498
00:20:35,636 --> 00:20:37,289
I couldn't get enough of it,

499
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,711
so I think yes--

500
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:41,106
- Jared touches my butt a lot, actually.

501
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:43,996
If we're just around the house,

502
00:20:43,996 --> 00:20:46,407
he's always like, "Hey," and pats my butt.

503
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:48,324
- Good game, good game.

504
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,081
That's you know, physical
touch in a relationship

505
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,172
I think is important.

506
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:54,852
I think when we talked
about love languages,

507
00:20:54,852 --> 00:20:58,574
that's my love language is physical touch.

508
00:20:58,574 --> 00:20:59,407
That was third for you.

509
00:20:59,407 --> 00:21:00,320
- Act of service.

510
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,291
- Yeah, and physical
touch was third for you.

511
00:21:03,291 --> 00:21:05,276
- I like my back to be rubbed.

512
00:21:05,276 --> 00:21:07,163
- So I like to touch Ellie's butt,

513
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:09,554
and Ellie likes me to touch her back.

514
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,040
(Ellie laughs)

515
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,154
Thanks for the question Aspen.

516
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:14,185
- "How do you make it a priority

517
00:21:14,185 --> 00:21:15,738
"to devote time to your marriage,

518
00:21:15,738 --> 00:21:17,440
"rather than just as parents?

519
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,220
"This is a hard struggle in my household.

520
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,410
"We seem to forget we're
married, not just parents."

521
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,620
- Having a set date night
is one of the best ways

522
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,907
that you can do that.

523
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:28,666
We don't do a good job
of that, but we want to.

524
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:30,827
We always want to.

525
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:32,426
Whether it's an elaborate date night

526
00:21:32,426 --> 00:21:34,085
with you and your spouse, a double date,

527
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,010
or even just like we mentioned earlier,

528
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,854
bath time with a snack and a drink,

529
00:21:38,854 --> 00:21:40,524
that's a great time to do that.

530
00:21:40,524 --> 00:21:43,746
That's simple and quick,
but it's very effective

531
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:47,246
in terms of cultivating and
developing your relationship

532
00:21:47,246 --> 00:21:48,468
as a couple.

533
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:49,800
- Totally.

534
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,617
This is a really hard, hard question.

535
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:55,431
This is something that Jared and I

536
00:21:55,431 --> 00:21:57,593
probably struggle the most with,

537
00:21:57,593 --> 00:22:01,510
is our time with parent,
and work, and then us.

538
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,567
Especially with us, it's all in one.

539
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:11,070
In our home, we work in
home, we parent in the home,

540
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,851
and then it's like us together.

541
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:14,638
It's like we see each
other during the day,

542
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:18,373
but it's not always
like really, good solid

543
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:19,538
one-on-one.

544
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,371
- It's business.

545
00:22:20,371 --> 00:22:23,297
In the daytime, we're all about business.

546
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:24,912
- That's very hard for Jared and I,

547
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:26,833
and it is something that we struggle with,

548
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,705
and that we're trying.

549
00:22:28,705 --> 00:22:31,755
There's often times where we
just have to tell each other,

550
00:22:31,755 --> 00:22:35,095
or one of us has to say, we're done.

551
00:22:35,095 --> 00:22:36,598
- It's usually Ellie that says that.

552
00:22:36,598 --> 00:22:40,350
- It's nine o'clock, and
I can't any more today.

553
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,742
My brain is done, my emotions
are swept from all day

554
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,615
taking care of the kids, cleaning.

555
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,590
I need you to just sit with me,

556
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,058
and that is something that we
are really trying to work on,

557
00:22:53,058 --> 00:22:55,786
especially probably the last six months.

558
00:22:55,786 --> 00:22:58,036
We've had two miscarriages.

559
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:04,014
That's something that
Jared and I are definitely

560
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:05,560
trying to work on, and it's like,

561
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,227
we always talk about

562
00:23:09,186 --> 00:23:10,223
before we had kids,

563
00:23:10,223 --> 00:23:13,524
it's like every flippin
day was a date night.

564
00:23:13,524 --> 00:23:14,452
He got home from work,

565
00:23:14,452 --> 00:23:16,884
and then we didn't have
to think about anything.

566
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,837
Now it's like we have kids to put to bed.

567
00:23:19,837 --> 00:23:20,670
We have like--

568
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,598
- And a video to edit.

569
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:25,975
- Yeah, we have other
priorities even after work.

570
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:29,718
It is something that it's an every day.

571
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:33,344
Some days, and that's beautiful
too about what we do though,

572
00:23:33,344 --> 00:23:35,560
it's like some days it's all work one day,

573
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,151
but then the next, it is all like...

574
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:39,984
- Family.

575
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,875
- Yeah, family, so there's pros and cons

576
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,935
to everybody's situations,
but I think that,

577
00:23:46,935 --> 00:23:50,468
that's really important
for husbands and wives

578
00:23:50,468 --> 00:23:54,348
to say no, and to have one-on-one time.

579
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:55,933
- And date each other.

580
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:57,824
- Totally, and we're learning.

581
00:23:57,824 --> 00:23:59,016
We're still learning.

582
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:01,502
- It'll be eight years,
and that's the thing.

583
00:24:01,502 --> 00:24:04,453
You always have to be
educating, and improving,

584
00:24:04,453 --> 00:24:06,043
and working hard at it.

585
00:24:06,043 --> 00:24:08,540
It's not some that you
just master an you're done.

586
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,332
It's something that you're
always constantly working on.

587
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:13,968
- Do you feel like now
that you've been married,

588
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:16,001
and even when we first
got married that you were

589
00:24:16,001 --> 00:24:18,749
a little like, oh, it's not like that.

590
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:21,744
I remember being a little
girl, looking at may parents,

591
00:24:21,744 --> 00:24:25,629
and thinking once you're
married, you're set.

592
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:29,151
I used to think that, because
I looked at my parents,

593
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:32,162
and my parents never fought.

594
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:35,626
I remember my parents
having disagreements.

595
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:40,573
Never were they yelling,
never did my dad hit my mom.

596
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:43,619
It was just, oh that's
life, they're happy.

597
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:46,437
When I got married, it
was like what the...

598
00:24:46,437 --> 00:24:48,020
- What's wrong with Jared?

599
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,084
- You know it, but my parents
did have those issues.

600
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:55,251
They handled them in different
ways than some other people.

601
00:24:56,707 --> 00:25:00,874
- It's just a constant
evolution, because life changes,

602
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,398
situation changes.

603
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:04,251
- And you grow.

604
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:05,262
- And that means your
relationship changes.

605
00:25:05,262 --> 00:25:08,595
- I was 18, and now I'm coming up on 27.

606
00:25:09,651 --> 00:25:12,990
It's like I myself have changed, you know.

607
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,360
- Yeah, absolutely, and that's
why we are doing this too,

608
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,206
because we learn from doing
these Q and As just as much

609
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:23,014
as someone might be able
to take a snip it from it.

610
00:25:23,014 --> 00:25:24,545
- It's good to talk it out.

611
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:25,378
- I have to fart.

612
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:28,560
- (laughs) See I'm not
the only stinky one.

613
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,393
(Jared farts loudly)

614
00:25:29,393 --> 00:25:31,808
(Ellie squeals)

615
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:32,997
- You better keep that in.

616
00:25:32,997 --> 00:25:34,189
- No way.

617
00:25:34,189 --> 00:25:36,462
- You keep mine all the time.

618
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:37,750
You will keep that in.

619
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,583
- We'll see.

620
00:25:38,583 --> 00:25:39,416
- He does that.

621
00:25:39,416 --> 00:25:40,679
Sometimes he makes me look bad.

622
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:41,977
I'm like, Jared.

623
00:25:41,977 --> 00:25:43,029
- "How do you share your feelings

624
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:44,508
"and struggles with each other?

625
00:25:44,508 --> 00:25:46,974
"Do you ever feel scared to
talk about how you feel?"

626
00:25:46,974 --> 00:25:47,807
- Yes.

627
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:51,722
- I feel like I used to,
but I feel like I've gotten

628
00:25:51,722 --> 00:25:52,945
a lot better at it.

629
00:25:52,945 --> 00:25:55,929
When we first got married, I was scared,

630
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,609
and almost embarrassed
to talk about finances.

631
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:02,201
- I didn't think he was, and
this is why I went back to,

632
00:26:02,201 --> 00:26:04,418
I wish I would have
detail talk about things

633
00:26:04,418 --> 00:26:05,902
before we got married.

634
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:08,749
I remember being married two months,

635
00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:11,459
and I was looking at the
account for something,

636
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:13,178
and I kept seeing transactions.

637
00:26:13,178 --> 00:26:17,127
I'm like, we should
probably have a food budget.

638
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:21,450
There was a lot of Taco Bell
going on for both of us,

639
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:24,696
so I remember you were in that pink chair,

640
00:26:24,696 --> 00:26:27,645
and I was like, "Hey Jared,
I think we should..."

641
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:30,246
and I had a book written
out of some things.

642
00:26:30,246 --> 00:26:33,187
We should figure out
how much is our income,

643
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:34,739
let's figure out our budget.

644
00:26:34,739 --> 00:26:37,260
- Like any couple should do,
if you don't have a budget,

645
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,184
you should do it.

646
00:26:39,184 --> 00:26:42,452
- I'd never seen Jared
react this way ever,

647
00:26:42,452 --> 00:26:43,983
in our relationship,
and then the two months

648
00:26:43,983 --> 00:26:44,816
of being married.

649
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,988
I seriously was like, "What the heck?"

650
00:26:46,988 --> 00:26:48,372
- I just put up a wall.

651
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:49,205
- "Who are you?"

652
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:50,620
- I put up a wall, and I
didn't want to talk about it.

653
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,953
- And I was mad.

654
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,081
He just was like, he's like, "No."

655
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:56,498
I'm like, "What?"

656
00:26:58,041 --> 00:27:00,635
- Part of the reason I
won't go into it too deep,

657
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:01,682
but like--

658
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:02,645
- It was personal.

659
00:27:02,645 --> 00:27:05,562
- It was personal, and
my parents didn't talk

660
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:08,140
about finances with the kids,

661
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,646
and so I didn't talk about
finances with really anyone else,

662
00:27:11,646 --> 00:27:14,968
and so that's just kinda
how it just translated over.

663
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,680
As soon as we did, and as soon as we were

664
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,067
on the same page with it,

665
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:21,536
oh my gosh the weight that it
lifted from our shoulders--

666
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:24,367
- That helped.
- Was amazing.

667
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,420
I mean there were definitely
times that we were scared

668
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,290
to talk about feelings, but I feel like,

669
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:30,020
just like our relationship has developed,

670
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,407
so has the ability to share
and experience those feelings.

671
00:27:33,407 --> 00:27:34,976
- I remember something that helped us

672
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:36,662
get into financial thing,

673
00:27:36,662 --> 00:27:39,246
and whether you agree with
everything he says or not,

674
00:27:39,246 --> 00:27:42,797
it's good to listen to, because
some of it is common sense,

675
00:27:42,797 --> 00:27:45,938
is Dave Ramsey, and not
just read his book, listen.

676
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:46,771
- Listen.

677
00:27:46,771 --> 00:27:49,560
- Because Jared laughed so much.

678
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,164
He would come home from school,

679
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:53,253
and they would be playing,
and he would be laughing,

680
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,016
because he's funny.

681
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,928
- Yeah, and motivational.

682
00:27:56,928 --> 00:27:59,907
He makes you want to do good.

683
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:00,997
- So that helped us a lot.

684
00:28:00,997 --> 00:28:04,163
It was like listening to
finance stuff together.

685
00:28:04,163 --> 00:28:06,402
- Well this is a great way
to Segway into this topic

686
00:28:06,402 --> 00:28:07,428
a little bit deeper.

687
00:28:07,428 --> 00:28:08,886
The next question says,

688
00:28:08,886 --> 00:28:10,371
"I noticed in some of your earlier videos,

689
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:11,785
"you mentioned budgeting.

690
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,060
"What does your budget look like?

691
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,260
"I feel like money is
one of the hardest things

692
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,046
"to combat in a marriage,
and just wondering

693
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,533
"how you recommend tackling it?"

694
00:28:17,533 --> 00:28:19,306
Well like I mentioned before,

695
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:22,371
we use the Dave Ramsey envelope system.

696
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,969
Essentially what we do,
is we spend our money,

697
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:29,136
on paper, on purpose, before
the month even happens.

698
00:28:30,395 --> 00:28:32,488
- So we think what are we gonna make?

699
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:34,328
What we actually make.

700
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,873
What is our expenses?

701
00:28:36,873 --> 00:28:39,615
What's left over, where can we put that?

702
00:28:39,615 --> 00:28:43,873
Could it be in a car fund,
a house fund, savings?

703
00:28:43,873 --> 00:28:44,828
- Retirement.

704
00:28:44,828 --> 00:28:47,735
- School loan, if you
have one, type of stuff.

705
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:50,315
- Finances can be a touchy subject,

706
00:28:50,315 --> 00:28:53,331
but I feel like when you
have that information,

707
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:55,321
you have power.

708
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:58,458
If you're kind of just going
by the seat of your pants.

709
00:28:58,458 --> 00:28:59,865
- It gets spent.

710
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:02,865
If you don't plan it, it gets spent.

711
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:04,910
Even if you're not a spender,

712
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,258
somehow it's like, where did it go?

713
00:29:07,258 --> 00:29:09,346
I feel like it's really important

714
00:29:09,346 --> 00:29:11,763
that not one persons does it.

715
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:15,262
There's a lot of people that,
that's how it works for them,

716
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:16,866
and if you're okay with that,

717
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,180
by all means do that.

718
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,322
- Do what works for you.

719
00:29:19,322 --> 00:29:24,321
- I feel like that's almost
like intimacy, finances,

720
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:27,248
those are two huge parts of marriages,

721
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:30,362
and I feel like you need
to be on the same page.

722
00:29:30,362 --> 00:29:33,648
Intimacy, you really, really
should be on the same page

723
00:29:33,648 --> 00:29:37,308
with finances too, and know
where things are going,

724
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,641
and feel comfortable spending the money.

725
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,286
I mean, I know we talk
about Dave Ramsey a lot,

726
00:29:44,286 --> 00:29:46,900
but it's kind of just common sense.

727
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:47,733
- It really is.

728
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:51,952
He says it's like the
grandmother's way of finances,

729
00:29:51,952 --> 00:29:53,893
and it's true, but it works.

730
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:57,957
There's so many different
ways that you can go about it,

731
00:29:57,957 --> 00:30:01,737
but it's just simple and
everyone can understand it.

732
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:03,136
I mean, I guess just for the sake,

733
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:07,471
we'll have his website linked
in the description down below,

734
00:30:07,471 --> 00:30:08,905
for information.

735
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:11,485
He has a radio show, you know.

736
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:12,318
- It's always fun to listen to.

737
00:30:12,318 --> 00:30:13,276
- Yeah, just check it out.

738
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:15,553
It's not gonna hurt you to listen.

739
00:30:15,553 --> 00:30:16,386
It won't.

740
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:18,953
- I really like this one,
especially for Jared and I,

741
00:30:18,953 --> 00:30:22,536
because we really did
get married so young.

742
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:27,034
"Did you ever feel rushed to get married?

743
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:30,211
"I'm 23, and my boyfriend and
I have dated for seven years.

744
00:30:30,211 --> 00:30:31,788
"I love it, would also
love to get married,

745
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,956
"but I'm in now rush to do so.

746
00:30:33,956 --> 00:30:35,017
"We talk about marriage all the time,

747
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,333
"and know it will happen eventually.

748
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:39,916
"How did you know when
the right time was?"

749
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:43,776
I really want to answer this,
because we were really young.

750
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,935
I remember going into JC Penney's,

751
00:30:45,935 --> 00:30:47,196
and I was trying on a dress.

752
00:30:47,196 --> 00:30:50,683
It was like four, something
to do with the wedding.

753
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:53,132
This was the first time
that somebody in public,

754
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:56,316
a stranger, was like, "What?"

755
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:57,592
She was like, "How old are you?"

756
00:30:57,592 --> 00:31:00,857
I mean, I still look like I'm 15,

757
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:02,677
and I was kind of, I
walked out of the store

758
00:31:02,677 --> 00:31:04,838
feeling really weird,
because she was like,

759
00:31:04,838 --> 00:31:08,142
"You're getting married,
you have your whole life."

760
00:31:08,142 --> 00:31:10,766
I just thought, "But I know what I want,

761
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:12,564
"and I found it, and I want it,

762
00:31:12,564 --> 00:31:14,479
"and I don't want to let it go."

763
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:18,260
I, not for a second felt
rushed with my parents,

764
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:20,836
didn't feel rushed with religion.

765
00:31:20,836 --> 00:31:23,584
That's the thing, whatever
decision you make,

766
00:31:23,584 --> 00:31:27,164
that's your decision, and
even if you do feel rushed

767
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:29,071
by someone, at the end of the day,

768
00:31:29,071 --> 00:31:32,518
you made that decision to get married.

769
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,307
I don't know if you could
say you were rushed,

770
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,468
because you made that decision.

771
00:31:37,468 --> 00:31:40,454
I didn't feel rushed whatsoever.

772
00:31:40,454 --> 00:31:41,287
- Neither did I.

773
00:31:41,287 --> 00:31:43,359
I mean this was the decision that we made,

774
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:46,280
and we took the time that we
wanted for our engagement,

775
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,355
for our wedding, and everything.

776
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:50,605
There was no rushing there.

777
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:55,259
It felt right, and I feel like--

778
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:56,092
- And is was smooth.

779
00:31:56,092 --> 00:32:00,114
There was arguments, but
there wasn't many arguments.

780
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:02,177
It wasn't like...

781
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,325
- It wasn't the type of arguments

782
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:05,233
that would make or break a relationship.

783
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:06,956
- It wasn't like red flags everywhere.

784
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,500
It was like we grew,
and I think the reason

785
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:12,963
why it went so smooth, is
because we both grew up

786
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:14,630
almost the same way.

787
00:32:15,543 --> 00:32:17,257
We both thought the same things,

788
00:32:17,257 --> 00:32:19,496
and that really helped us.

789
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:21,566
- The thing about other people saying,

790
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,393
well don't you want to live life,

791
00:32:23,393 --> 00:32:24,944
and experience it.

792
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:25,777
- There was pros and cons.

793
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,351
- There are, but at the
same time it was like,

794
00:32:28,351 --> 00:32:30,698
well I want to experience
that with my wife.

795
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,039
I want to experience that with my family.

796
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,541
My wife is my best friend.

797
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,056
Why not go on these
adventures with my wife,

798
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,181
and my best friend?

799
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:41,371
- I look at it two ways.

800
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,679
If we were to have waited or whatever,

801
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,852
and I got married right now at my age,

802
00:32:45,852 --> 00:32:50,765
I would be a completely different
newlywed wife, completely.

803
00:32:50,765 --> 00:32:52,765
That could be a big pro.

804
00:32:55,282 --> 00:32:58,250
I really enjoyed that we got married

805
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,253
when we were in college,

806
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:02,883
because we learned to struggle together.

807
00:33:02,883 --> 00:33:07,050
We learned to get by with
very, very little money.

808
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:11,931
We learned together, you know--

809
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:15,147
- We've gone through the
best and the worst, together.

810
00:33:15,147 --> 00:33:17,305
- You still will go through
bad times and good times,

811
00:33:17,305 --> 00:33:20,819
even if you get married later in life.

812
00:33:20,819 --> 00:33:22,885
There's no right or wrong.

813
00:33:22,885 --> 00:33:24,133
- This isn't like I say,

814
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,424
"You need to get married young."

815
00:33:25,424 --> 00:33:28,205
No, you need to get married when you feel

816
00:33:28,205 --> 00:33:29,814
it's right for you and your partner.

817
00:33:29,814 --> 00:33:32,481
- And there shouldn't be a rush.

818
00:33:33,382 --> 00:33:36,058
"As a wife and mother, to
legitimately wanting to know

819
00:33:36,058 --> 00:33:38,568
"how to keep the love alive.

820
00:33:38,568 --> 00:33:39,877
"I just like your advice.

821
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:41,797
"Sorry if my original post offended you."

822
00:33:41,797 --> 00:33:42,721
- No, we didn't delete--

823
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,542
- I didn't delete it, I promise you.

824
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:47,975
"How do you keep the spice alive?"

825
00:33:47,975 --> 00:33:50,928
Let's really think about that one.

826
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:53,784
♫ How do you keep the love alive

827
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:56,259
To me, it's being goofy,

828
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:59,666
and I feel like the vlogs don't
really capture that a lot,

829
00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:03,350
because sometimes it's
like, "She's a freak."

830
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,260
- Well, it's also because
it's so spontaneous.

831
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,396
It's like, wait let me get
the camera, start over.

832
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:10,726
It's just like you just roll with it.

833
00:34:10,726 --> 00:34:14,069
- I think to me, keeping it spunky, spicy,

834
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,953
it is totally being goofy.

835
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:18,150
Like funny things,

836
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:22,020
just like being in the
shower and just being dumb.

837
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,021
- Wait, do you laugh in the shower?

838
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,797
- This is gonna go the wrong way.

839
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,431
This is gonna go the wrong way.

840
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:29,325
- I know what you're trying to say.

841
00:34:29,326 --> 00:34:30,731
When you're laughing together,

842
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:32,103
you're enjoying each other's company,

843
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:33,930
you're just having a good time together.

844
00:34:33,931 --> 00:34:35,297
You're being goofy together.

845
00:34:35,297 --> 00:34:37,312
- And not being so serious.

846
00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:40,433
I think sexual jokes are really funny.

847
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:41,492
They're hilarious.

848
00:34:41,492 --> 00:34:43,659
They always make me laugh,

849
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:49,263
and I always say stuff
that's really funny,

850
00:34:49,263 --> 00:34:51,005
and sometimes borderline,

851
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,951
like you probably
shouldn't have said that,

852
00:34:52,951 --> 00:34:57,668
and that makes us laugh,
and it lightens the mood.

853
00:34:57,668 --> 00:35:02,087
If your humor is not that way,
maybe don't go that route.

854
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:05,476
To me if I can make a sexual
joke, and make them laugh,

855
00:35:05,476 --> 00:35:07,535
that makes my day.

856
00:35:07,535 --> 00:35:08,928
- Then it's spicy for sure.

857
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:11,160
(Ellie laughs)

858
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,566
Again, I think it goes
back to the communication,

859
00:35:14,566 --> 00:35:17,065
the dating your spouse, all
of the things that we've

860
00:35:17,065 --> 00:35:20,530
talked back before, apply
that to your relationship,

861
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,553
and see what works for
you and your spouse.

862
00:35:24,553 --> 00:35:26,329
"How important do you
think physical contact,

863
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,088
"hugs, cuddling is to a relationship?

864
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:30,693
"Obviously emotional
connection is more important,

865
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:33,491
"but should you go out of
your way to give your partner

866
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:35,026
"that physical affection?"

867
00:35:35,026 --> 00:35:39,187
I think this goes to the love languages.

868
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:41,053
There's this love language book.

869
00:35:41,053 --> 00:35:42,057
I mean, it's not like--

870
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,338
- I do think that's important.

871
00:35:43,338 --> 00:35:45,230
That would have been fun to
do before we got married.

872
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,581
- I think you should do it.

873
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:48,556
I don't think it's like...

874
00:35:48,556 --> 00:35:49,389
- Crucial.

875
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:53,369
- Yeah, it's not imperative,
but it would be eye opening.

876
00:35:53,369 --> 00:35:56,715
For some people as far as
learning about their spouse,

877
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:58,878
and even learning about yourself.

878
00:35:58,878 --> 00:36:03,108
I like physical touch, and
not even just like sexual,

879
00:36:03,108 --> 00:36:06,145
but I like to cuddle, I like
to hold hands, I like to hug.

880
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:09,094
- If we have an argument, the
first thing Jared does is,

881
00:36:09,094 --> 00:36:10,105
"Oh Ellie."

882
00:36:10,105 --> 00:36:11,218
- I just want to hug.

883
00:36:11,218 --> 00:36:12,798
- And the first thing I
do, if like I do is like--

884
00:36:12,798 --> 00:36:13,796
- Give me space!

885
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,101
- Yeah the first thing I say is, "Not yet,

886
00:36:15,101 --> 00:36:17,156
"let's talk this out."

887
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:19,601
I'm a little mad, I don't
want to hug when I'm mad.

888
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:20,942
I want to hug you when I'm happy,

889
00:36:20,942 --> 00:36:23,552
so that's usually how it goes down.

890
00:36:23,552 --> 00:36:26,269
- I feel like physical
touch in the right times

891
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:28,697
and the right places.

892
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:32,451
- Right places, don't grab
her boobs in public (laughs).

893
00:36:32,451 --> 00:36:33,672
- Not that in the right places,

894
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:36,255
I mean like in the right times,

895
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:41,981
and not physical places
but you know what I mean.

896
00:36:41,981 --> 00:36:44,716
- Yeah, I get what you're putting down.

897
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:45,549
- What is that?

898
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:47,001
Freudian slip, I don't know
if that's a Freudian slip,

899
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,813
but I think it's important to identify

900
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:52,315
what kind of love
language your partner has

901
00:36:52,315 --> 00:36:56,543
to give that to them, instead
of just physical touch,

902
00:36:56,543 --> 00:36:57,804
if that makes sense.

903
00:36:57,804 --> 00:36:59,691
- I do think it's important.

904
00:36:59,691 --> 00:37:02,280
It's sad that at the end of the day,

905
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,144
we're outside, did we
even look at each other

906
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:06,258
in the eye?

907
00:37:06,258 --> 00:37:08,264
That is a big deal.

908
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:10,877
Even just looking at
each other and talking,

909
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:13,560
'cause how often are the kids around,

910
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,511
and we're talking to the
kids, and we're talking.

911
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:18,493
We've had a good day,
but did we even really,

912
00:37:18,493 --> 00:37:21,884
look at each other, because
sometimes you say things

913
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:24,955
to your spouse, and it's
like that's your spouse

914
00:37:24,955 --> 00:37:26,333
you're talking to.

915
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:30,041
Sometimes I don't look
at you as just a spouse,

916
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,455
yeah we're living
together, you're my friend,

917
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:33,228
and I'm just gonna say it.

918
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:34,756
Sometimes we could be better at,

919
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:37,135
you have your feelings and emotions,

920
00:37:37,135 --> 00:37:40,337
and we could be better at talking nicer.

921
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:41,542
You get in the habit of saying,

922
00:37:41,542 --> 00:37:43,103
oh go grab me that.

923
00:37:43,103 --> 00:37:44,621
Well, no, please.

924
00:37:44,621 --> 00:37:46,761
You know, so I think it's really important

925
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:48,801
to just look at each other in the eye--

926
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:51,440
- And think of the
other person's emotions,

927
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,854
like you said.

928
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,748
It's great to take yourself out of that.

929
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:55,768
- I have a lot of fault in that.

930
00:37:55,768 --> 00:37:57,583
- It's great to take yourself
out of the situation,

931
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,246
and observe it from both sides.

932
00:37:59,246 --> 00:38:01,952
There's this comedian,
and he has this joke.

933
00:38:01,952 --> 00:38:04,203
I'm not sure if it's
appropriate or anything,

934
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:07,592
but I feel like in my
head, the analogy works.

935
00:38:07,592 --> 00:38:11,984
He says, "I don't understand
spouses getting so mad

936
00:38:11,984 --> 00:38:13,776
"at each other that they
do things to each other.

937
00:38:13,776 --> 00:38:14,895
"It's not right."

938
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:16,897
He's like, "That's like
keying your own car.

939
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:19,161
"You would not key your own car.

940
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:20,673
"That's your spouse, that's your car.

941
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:22,840
"You would not do that thing."

942
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,533
It is kind of true, it's just
like you have to remember

943
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,416
that's my wife, or that's my husband.

944
00:38:27,416 --> 00:38:28,744
That's my best friend.

945
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:31,274
Why would I do those things to hurt you?

946
00:38:31,274 --> 00:38:33,126
- Sometimes you hurt the
ones you love the most.

947
00:38:33,126 --> 00:38:34,195
- Yeah, that's deep.

948
00:38:34,195 --> 00:38:37,644
- You do, not always
sometimes, like you usually do.

949
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:38,993
Sometimes you say things, and it's like,

950
00:38:38,993 --> 00:38:41,239
"Why did you do that?"

951
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:42,391
- That's why it's also good--

952
00:38:42,391 --> 00:38:46,813
- I think it is important to
have the physical contact.

953
00:38:46,813 --> 00:38:48,200
- Forgiveness is another thing

954
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,498
that I think is really
important, that a lot of people

955
00:38:50,498 --> 00:38:54,226
don't fully take into considerations.

956
00:38:54,226 --> 00:38:56,996
It's like we all make
mistakes, we're human.

957
00:38:56,996 --> 00:38:59,428
- Every day, for the rest of our lives,

958
00:38:59,428 --> 00:39:02,769
we're going to be working on this.

959
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:05,940
- We need to remember that
when we go about these things.

960
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,418
I mean there's a line to certain things,

961
00:39:07,418 --> 00:39:09,421
but I'm talking in general.

962
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:13,696
We make mistakes, and when
you can take these mistakes

963
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:15,046
that you're both making together,

964
00:39:15,046 --> 00:39:17,691
and come to be better
people from those mistakes.

965
00:39:17,691 --> 00:39:20,072
The trials that you go
through don't define you,

966
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:21,884
and the trials that you
overcome define you.

967
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:24,066
If you can overcome those
mistakes and those trials,

968
00:39:24,066 --> 00:39:26,465
then you'll be better people for it,

969
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,822
and better relationships.

970
00:39:27,822 --> 00:39:29,621
- I don't know if this is
even going to make sense,

971
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:31,041
you can cut it out if you want,

972
00:39:31,041 --> 00:39:33,914
but I'm just thinking
with you saying that.

973
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:38,167
It's like, when you get
married, it's not perfect,

974
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,500
and it never is.

975
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:43,212
We do make mistakes.

976
00:39:43,212 --> 00:39:45,072
In a way I'm relating that to church.

977
00:39:45,072 --> 00:39:49,239
It's like, we don't go to
church because we're perfect.

978
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,002
We go to church because we're trying.

979
00:39:53,002 --> 00:39:56,991
We go to church because
it helps me remember

980
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:59,735
why I'm going to church,
is to be better to people,

981
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:02,765
to be better to myself,
to be better to my spouse.

982
00:40:02,765 --> 00:40:05,304
In a way I relate those
two, because it's like,

983
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:08,010
you make mistakes, and
that's what church is for.

984
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,099
I make mistakes, but that's
what our marriage is for.

985
00:40:11,099 --> 00:40:15,675
Is I made a mistake and
I need to lean on you.

986
00:40:15,675 --> 00:40:16,997
- That's another really good point

987
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:19,378
that I've talked a lot about in the vlogs,

988
00:40:19,378 --> 00:40:20,323
but I haven't said here.

989
00:40:20,323 --> 00:40:22,856
It's like, having a spouse is so wonderful

990
00:40:22,856 --> 00:40:27,204
when you can depend on them
to lean on when you need it.

991
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:30,687
It's almost like a balance thing.

992
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:33,792
When I'm feeling up high,
and Ellie's not like,

993
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,907
I want to be there for her,
so I'm going to be the support

994
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:40,165
that she needs to bring her
back up, and vice versa.

995
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:44,002
- I think it's very important
to let the other person vent.

996
00:40:44,002 --> 00:40:47,172
The other day Jared, Penny
had jumped on the desk.

997
00:40:47,172 --> 00:40:48,611
She got milk everywhere.

998
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,972
It was a hot day mess.

999
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,620
- I have a lot of equipment in my office.

1000
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,957
- It was a hot mess, and
Jared was really mad.

1001
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:56,694
I walked in the office,
and I was like Jared.

1002
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:58,326
'Cause in my head, it's
like we'll clean up.

1003
00:40:58,326 --> 00:40:59,487
It's okay.

1004
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:02,969
He's like, "Ellie, I need to vent."

1005
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:06,605
In that moment I thought
I'm gonna shut it up.

1006
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:08,422
I let you be mad for a
minute, and it's like,

1007
00:41:08,422 --> 00:41:09,546
you should be.

1008
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:11,552
- I cleaned up the mess,
and as soon as everything

1009
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,670
was taken care of--

1010
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,586
- He walked out of the
office, and was like,

1011
00:41:13,586 --> 00:41:14,419
"How are you?"

1012
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:16,169
I'm like, "I'm good."

1013
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,044
- That's exactly how it happened too.

1014
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,044
- It was really funny.

1015
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:23,051
I was like, "He's so damned bubbly."

1016
00:41:23,051 --> 00:41:25,710
I think that's another
thing that's important,

1017
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:29,710
is don't be upset if your
other spouse is upset.

1018
00:41:31,134 --> 00:41:33,305
Let them vent, let them talk.

1019
00:41:33,305 --> 00:41:36,890
Sometimes it's not
always soft spoken angry.

1020
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,392
Sometimes they are upset
and raising their voice.

1021
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:44,518
Hear them out and then
you be the one to be calm

1022
00:41:44,518 --> 00:41:47,316
to talk about it, and
then hopefully next time,

1023
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:50,405
when you're upset,
hopefully, they'll be calm

1024
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:51,965
to talk it out.

1025
00:41:51,965 --> 00:41:53,203
- I feel like when--

1026
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:54,584
- It's a learning...

1027
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:56,890
- Yeah, when something that
Ellie and I have been doing,

1028
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,578
and working hard at is when
we do have our arguments,

1029
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:03,765
we take the time to calm
ourself, so we're talking

1030
00:42:03,765 --> 00:42:05,145
in this manner right here,

1031
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,780
rather than yelling at each other.

1032
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,750
That helps a ton.

1033
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:10,731
If you're just talking to me
without raising your voice,

1034
00:42:10,731 --> 00:42:13,142
and I'm talking to you
without getting mad or angry--

1035
00:42:13,142 --> 00:42:14,119
- Things resolve easy.

1036
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:16,189
That's hard to do with kids.

1037
00:42:16,189 --> 00:42:18,480
During the day, sometimes
that's really hard,

1038
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,188
when it's like, you've got
two kids running around.

1039
00:42:21,188 --> 00:42:24,408
They are crying, they're whining,
someone just broke a dish.

1040
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:25,909
The dog just jumped on the couch.

1041
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:28,243
The dog just knocked Calvin over,

1042
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:31,197
and it's like, "Knock it off!"

1043
00:42:31,197 --> 00:42:34,152
Sometimes it's just hard
to be that calm person,

1044
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,652
and that's normal.

1045
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,865
It's just life, and
sometimes you just need

1046
00:42:40,865 --> 00:42:43,865
to just take a big flippin breather.

1047
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,585
- Honestly, that is a huge help.

1048
00:42:47,585 --> 00:42:48,421
It's funny, like on the Apple Watch,

1049
00:42:48,421 --> 00:42:49,643
they have that breathe app.

1050
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:53,698
That helps me a ton,
to just whew (mumbles).

1051
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:55,970
- I would say even in
the last three months,

1052
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,155
with our miscarriages, and stuff,

1053
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:00,371
I feel like it has made
me grow a little bit.

1054
00:43:00,371 --> 00:43:02,731
My sister's like, "It
changes who are within."

1055
00:43:02,731 --> 00:43:05,273
I'm like, "I believe I have changed.

1056
00:43:05,273 --> 00:43:09,022
"I have been giving myself my time."

1057
00:43:09,022 --> 00:43:11,068
In the mornings, and the
kids have been pretty good

1058
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:12,318
to adapt to it.

1059
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:16,226
I tell them, I say, "It's
mommy time right now.

1060
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,726
"I'm just sitting.

1061
00:43:18,903 --> 00:43:21,893
"I'm not getting up, I'm going
to sit here for 30 minutes,

1062
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:23,876
"and just sit."

1063
00:43:23,876 --> 00:43:26,125
Then sometimes they run
wild and break a dish,

1064
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:28,027
and I just don't care for minute.

1065
00:43:28,027 --> 00:43:30,931
I just need to just be, you know.

1066
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:32,211
I think that's important.

1067
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:34,207
- Yeah, absolutely.

1068
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:37,128
The thing with all of this is
some things are going to work

1069
00:43:37,128 --> 00:43:38,529
for some of you, and some things

1070
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:40,266
are going to work for others.

1071
00:43:40,266 --> 00:43:42,801
This is just us essentially just talking,

1072
00:43:42,801 --> 00:43:43,908
having a conversation.

1073
00:43:43,908 --> 00:43:46,166
We're not professionals,
we're not perfect.

1074
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,540
We make mistakes, and
these are just some things

1075
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:52,233
that have worked for
us, and that we enjoy.

1076
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:55,131
Hopefully that some piece here and there

1077
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:59,298
can help some of you, and
that's why we wanted to do it.

1078
00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:02,208
- I feel like last but not least,

1079
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,809
I guess it doesn't come that smoothly.

1080
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:08,142
If you or your spouse, you're not wrong.

1081
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,324
That's okay, and that's normal.

1082
00:44:12,324 --> 00:44:13,340
- It takes time.

1083
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,093
- I talked about this
already in another video,

1084
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:18,052
but I feel like counseling
is not a bad thing.

1085
00:44:18,052 --> 00:44:21,716
To have another person, or even a parent,

1086
00:44:21,716 --> 00:44:24,101
if you really love and trust your parents,

1087
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:26,581
how many times have me
and you had conversations

1088
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:27,567
with your parents.

1089
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,902
It's like, we've been
fighting a lot lately.

1090
00:44:29,902 --> 00:44:33,427
We have that conversation
with your dad a year ago.

1091
00:44:33,427 --> 00:44:36,606
How many times have we
been talking to my parents.

1092
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:40,589
We've talked about situations
and we've gotten their advice?

1093
00:44:40,589 --> 00:44:42,564
- Together, we have done that.

1094
00:44:42,564 --> 00:44:46,415
Not like one-on-one,
we've gone to our parents.

1095
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:48,957
- And just asked questions,
like what do you do for this,

1096
00:44:48,957 --> 00:44:51,635
and then you realize like, "Oh,
my parents aren't perfect."

1097
00:44:51,635 --> 00:44:54,146
It's like, "Cause nobody is."

1098
00:44:54,146 --> 00:44:55,644
- They've gone through
those similar things.

1099
00:44:55,644 --> 00:44:58,369
- 'Cause no one is perfect.

1100
00:44:58,369 --> 00:45:00,258
I really enjoyed talking it out.

1101
00:45:00,258 --> 00:45:01,463
- Yeah, I did too.

1102
00:45:01,463 --> 00:45:03,850
I mean I enjoyed it because,

1103
00:45:03,850 --> 00:45:04,914
even just sitting here talking,

1104
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:06,772
I've felt like we've learned and--

1105
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:08,438
- Connected.
- Yeah.

1106
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:10,984
- I'm not gonna lie, like Jared and I,

1107
00:45:10,984 --> 00:45:12,873
we do pray together,
and we did say a prayer

1108
00:45:12,873 --> 00:45:17,134
before this video, to
help us feel at peace,

1109
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:21,301
and talk openly, and I
really feel like that helped.

1110
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,745
I like praying with Jared,

1111
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:26,995
and I feel like that helps sometimes too.

1112
00:45:26,995 --> 00:45:29,017
Sometimes Jared says,
"You should say a prayer."

1113
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,184
I'm like, "No.

1114
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:33,241
"you say it."

1115
00:45:33,241 --> 00:45:35,354
(Jared and Ellie laugh)

1116
00:45:35,354 --> 00:45:36,828
He's laughing 'cause it's so true.

1117
00:45:36,828 --> 00:45:39,150
- Because it's true, yeah.

1118
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,409
- It does help.

1119
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:41,837
I truly feel like it does.

1120
00:45:41,837 --> 00:45:43,024
- Yeah, absolutely it does,

1121
00:45:43,024 --> 00:45:45,551
and that's just a part
of our relationship.

1122
00:45:45,551 --> 00:45:47,345
It really is, it's a
part of our relationship.

1123
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,552
- I'm the Debbie Downer.

1124
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:52,433
- It may not be everyone's
part, but it has helped us,

1125
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:54,200
and we're grateful for it,
and we wouldn't have it

1126
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,353
any other way.

1127
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,994
This is a learning experience.

1128
00:45:56,994 --> 00:45:57,827
- Thanks for your questions.

1129
00:45:57,827 --> 00:45:58,861
- Yeah, thank you for your questions.

1130
00:45:58,861 --> 00:46:02,400
We're here to learn and grow
right along side with you,

1131
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,942
so I hope you enjoyed.

1132
00:46:03,942 --> 00:46:05,859
I hope you got a smile,

1133
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,920
whether it's Ellie farting, or me?

1134
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,270
- You farted too, you better keep that in.

1135
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,136
- Shoot.

1136
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:14,186
- You have to.

1137
00:46:14,186 --> 00:46:16,701
- This video's getting too long as it is.

1138
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:18,779
Thank you for the questions.

1139
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:20,164
We'll do this again another time,

1140
00:46:20,164 --> 00:46:23,399
and maybe we'll podcast
it up or something.

1141
00:46:23,399 --> 00:46:24,703
Have a wonderful day.

1142
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:27,523
Go hug your spouse, hug your kids,

1143
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:28,909
and we'll see you guys next time.

1144
00:46:28,909 --> 00:46:29,742
Bye.

1145
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:32,040
- One day at a time.

1146
00:46:32,040 --> 00:00:00,000
♫ Time after time.
