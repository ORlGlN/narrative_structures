1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,696
- [Ellie] Who's ready?

2
00:00:01,696 --> 00:00:02,926
- [Jackson] Me, me.

3
00:00:02,926 --> 00:00:03,941
- [Ellie] Come here.

4
00:00:03,941 --> 00:00:05,455
We're gonna set up our tree.

5
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:07,335
- Yay!
- Yes!

6
00:00:07,335 --> 00:00:09,105
- What about the ornaments and the hooks?

7
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:10,115
- [Ellie] Yep, we'll get the hooks

8
00:00:10,115 --> 00:00:13,107
and the ornaments out for you guys

9
00:00:13,107 --> 00:00:15,484
to decorate this tree. Turn on that light.

10
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:16,317
- Aw..

11
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:17,402
- [Ellie] You want more?

12
00:00:17,402 --> 00:00:18,235
- Yeah.

13
00:00:18,235 --> 00:00:20,186
- [Ellie] I feel like
that's all you ever ask.

14
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,752
Let's set this tree up, okay?

15
00:00:22,752 --> 00:00:23,645
- Tree?

16
00:00:23,645 --> 00:00:24,738
- [Ellie] Yeah.

17
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:27,405
- I want that still on. Forever.

18
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:29,995
- [Ellie] The camera?

19
00:00:29,995 --> 00:00:32,906
Oh! Should we film us setting it up?

20
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:35,239
(baby talk)

21
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:39,080
- [Ellie] You want to set up the tree?

22
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,193
- Yeah, tree.

23
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:41,526
- Tree, my tree.

24
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,337
- Hello.

25
00:00:51,375 --> 00:00:53,080
- Heeellllooo.

26
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,247
- [Calvin] Hi.

27
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,342
Hi.

28
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:04,795
(giggles)

29
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:23,227
- Hiiii!

30
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:26,544
- [Ellie] You guys ready?

31
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,804
- Yup! We're ready.

32
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:30,116
- Are these the ornaments?

33
00:01:30,116 --> 00:01:32,436
- Yeah, those are candy cane ornaments.

34
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:34,936
- I love candy cane ornaments!

35
00:01:36,306 --> 00:01:39,801
(joyful Christmas music)

36
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,551
- Oh! It's so pretty!

37
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:44,168
- Yeah!

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,108
- It's your tree?

39
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,573
- It's my tree too!

40
00:01:49,573 --> 00:01:50,406
- Yeah!

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,748
- So, do we still like the name Mason?

42
00:01:57,748 --> 00:01:58,581
- Yeah.

43
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:06,992
- It is a... cupcake!

44
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:10,592
- Maybe right here.

45
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,482
- That looks so good.

46
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:16,949
This is so fun.

47
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:18,882
- Yeah, I know.

48
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,776
- I just have been too tired to do it,

49
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,599
but I'm glad that we're doing it now.

50
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,857
- Yeah.

51
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:25,163
- You've been so good.

52
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:27,568
- Me?
- Yes you have been a good boy

53
00:02:27,568 --> 00:02:29,397
You know that momma's been sick, huh?

54
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:30,647
- Yeah, I know.

55
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:32,937
- [Jackson] I'm so sorry.

56
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:36,604
- You're so sorry, come
here, give me a hug.

57
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:40,310
You are so cute to me!

58
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,727
(joyful Christmas music)

59
00:02:45,272 --> 00:02:48,689
- Look! Mine looks like a Christmas tree.

60
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:21,717
- I have been a flip-flopper
this Christmas season

61
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,184
whether to decorate the
Christmas tree or not.

62
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:28,269
And most of it has been
because I've been too tired

63
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:30,489
with my pregnancy, I'm
either with the kids

64
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,225
for a little bit of the
day or I'm laying down

65
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:36,104
and I just didn't know if
I had it in me to do it.

66
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:38,593
But this morning I did
and I'm glad that I did

67
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,643
because it's beautiful.

68
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:43,181
The kids decorated their tree
downstairs and they loved it.

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,278
They loved it!

70
00:03:44,278 --> 00:03:46,327
And it was so fun seeing them do it.

71
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:47,335
They're watching a movie and

72
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:49,367
I'm decorating the tree up here.

73
00:03:49,367 --> 00:03:52,177
And right now I have all of the filler in,

74
00:03:52,177 --> 00:03:56,677
so there's little flocked
ones, there's little berries

75
00:03:56,677 --> 00:04:00,015
and then there's like silver
berries all over the tree.

76
00:04:00,015 --> 00:04:03,033
And just having just that done,

77
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:05,193
I feel like has made it so pretty.

78
00:04:05,193 --> 00:04:07,863
Like, I would be happy
even if it was just that

79
00:04:07,863 --> 00:04:10,630
but I'm gonna continue,
I'm gonna do the ornaments.

80
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,297
I put my little deer up there,

81
00:04:13,297 --> 00:04:15,252
so we're gettin' things going.

82
00:04:15,252 --> 00:04:16,976
This is a cute thing, Emily made

83
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:20,416
this for me years ago for Christmas.

84
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,440
Got those in there,
and this is what we got

85
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,930
from our Redditgift, I believe
it was Reddit last year.

86
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,207
Today we announced that baby is a boy

87
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:33,775
on social media and all
of you guys are loving

88
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:37,101
the name Mason and it
just, like, tickles me

89
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:40,039
I'm so excited that everyone likes that.

90
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,885
Naming babies is interesting because

91
00:04:42,885 --> 00:04:44,856
I brought up that name a
little bit with Calvin,

92
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:46,670
but Jared and I were both were like,

93
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,958
"No, it doesn't fit."

94
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:52,057
It was so weird how like it
just didn't fit and Calvin did.

95
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:53,967
And how this time around it's like

96
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,993
Mason's settling really well with me.

97
00:04:55,993 --> 00:04:57,920
We just started talking
about names so we're

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,905
probably going to come
up with a lot more names

99
00:04:59,905 --> 00:05:02,056
and kind of decide and feel it out.

100
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:03,609
And, Jared's mom just texted me, she like,

101
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:04,960
"I love the name Mason"

102
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,957
and I'm like, "eyyyy".
More points for Mason.

103
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:10,753
Jared isn't a huge fan yet, I don't know

104
00:05:10,753 --> 00:05:13,377
if he doesn't like it we'll
think of some more names, but..

105
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,671
It's just fun, it's been fun
seeing you guys' reaction

106
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:17,875
thanks for being so happy for us!

107
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,146
I have just, I go to bed
late and I just think

108
00:05:20,146 --> 00:05:23,346
about him and I've been
looking at baby boy blankets

109
00:05:23,346 --> 00:05:25,040
and I'm thinking like,
what kind of blanket I

110
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,886
want him to have and picking out the baby

111
00:05:26,886 --> 00:05:28,808
blankets was like really
special for me when

112
00:05:28,808 --> 00:05:30,869
I picked out Jackson's and Calvin's

113
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:33,121
and they still have their baby blankets.

114
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,954
They use them every single night.

115
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:37,835
They are so small now, they're definitely

116
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:41,898
in need of a bigger one
and I just, it's fun.

117
00:05:41,898 --> 00:05:43,853
Life is really, really special, it's crazy

118
00:05:43,853 --> 00:05:46,316
how just a few months ago life was like

119
00:05:46,316 --> 00:05:48,544
shattered and it was like,

120
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:50,536
"This is insane, I don't know
if we can do this again."

121
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:53,253
And now, like life is really good and I'm

122
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:55,289
very, very grateful for
that, and I'm having

123
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,953
a lot of fun decorating my tree.

124
00:05:57,953 --> 00:05:58,863
(exhales)

125
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:00,249
I need Jared to help me with the top.

126
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:03,080
We're both very short
people so it's really

127
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,946
hard decorating the top of the tree.

128
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:09,113
Penny! That's not your
ball. That's not your ball.

129
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,030
Go put it on the tree, oh Penny!

130
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:17,177
No, no, no. Okay, drop.

131
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:19,265
She's like, "why can't I have it?"

132
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:21,175
No. It's not yours, come here.

133
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:22,261
Let's get you a toy.

134
00:06:22,261 --> 00:06:23,501
- [Jared] Penny if you're
going to grab an ornament

135
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:25,857
you have to put it on the
tree, that's the rule.

136
00:06:25,857 --> 00:06:29,107
That's the rule, that's the rule, okay?

137
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,806
Please cue the Final
Fantasy 7 Victory Fanfare.

138
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:36,759
(Fanfare plays)

139
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:39,084
Ellie, Tell them what we've done.

140
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:40,593
- We decorated the tree.

141
00:06:40,593 --> 00:06:43,519
- [Jared] Yes! It's finally done.

142
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,686
Look how pretty it is, I don't
know what we were thinking.

143
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:48,720
- I don't know, but
I'm glad that I did it.

144
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,459
Like, these ornaments are so cute.

145
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:52,836
- [Jared] They are very, very pretty

146
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:55,721
- And all the filler is
just fluffy, and fun.

147
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:57,722
- You know you don't have
a Christmas tree unless

148
00:06:57,722 --> 00:06:59,242
it's got some fluffy filler, you know?

149
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,805
- We have lots of fluff.

150
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:03,055
- Fluffy filler, all about.

151
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:08,858
Now that that is done, check.
Important things off our list.

152
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:12,044
Next we have to finish off our deliveries.

153
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:14,605
We've got some fun deliveries
that we have to make

154
00:07:14,605 --> 00:07:17,558
we have to go to ship some
stuff out, ship my pants!

155
00:07:17,558 --> 00:07:19,242
Of course I'm gonna ship my pants.

156
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:20,996
I just shipped my bed!

157
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:22,314
- What commercial was that?

158
00:07:22,314 --> 00:07:23,561
- [Jared] Kmart.

159
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:25,443
- That was like the best
commercial of the year.

160
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:26,863
- [Jared] It really was.

161
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,196
- I think companies, it's like
come on, have fun with it.

162
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,010
Make your customers
laugh, that was hilarious.

163
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,868
It is a week until Christmas
and we are doing our

164
00:07:34,868 --> 00:07:37,540
big major Christmas shopping right now

165
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,042
at the grocery store, I have a list

166
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,717
for Jared, a list for me, I'll get a cart,

167
00:07:43,717 --> 00:07:46,149
you get a cart and each
kid will get a cart.

168
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:48,367
- Now, are we, I'm just
looking at this list here

169
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,750
and I just have a
question, are we allowed to

170
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,240
make any changes to anything
that's on this list?

171
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,558
- [Ellie] As long as it's adding
to it and not taking away.

172
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:59,558
- For example, taking
away black beans, vinegar,

173
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:01,839
- [Ellie] No, I need that

174
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,891
- Cloves, nutmeg,

175
00:08:02,891 --> 00:08:04,243
- [Ellie] No, no, I want that.

176
00:08:04,243 --> 00:08:08,126
- Adding like, Dr. Pepper and cereal..

177
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:10,257
- [Ellie] No, you can add
to it, don't take away

178
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,090
- Don't take away

179
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,923
- [Ellie] Don't take away.

180
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,717
- I can add whatever I want,

181
00:08:13,717 --> 00:08:15,621
so they have like, Traegers in here..

182
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:19,064
- [Ellie] No, I mean, okay
I'll have the shopping list

183
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:21,415
and you get the cart, we
need two carts because

184
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,976
we need to get lots of toilet paper.

185
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,042
- I can do that.

186
00:08:24,042 --> 00:08:28,183
- [Jared] Yep, he knows just what to do.

187
00:08:28,183 --> 00:08:30,260
He's gonna help us, like, he really is.

188
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,423
Calvin opted for the motor vehicle cart

189
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,109
and that is what we're
rolling with right now.

190
00:08:35,109 --> 00:08:37,707
Oh, get it, rolling with?

191
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:39,895
(Christmas music)

192
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,270
Whee!

193
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,520
- Follow the leader, follow the leader.

194
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:48,086
Marco..

195
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:50,003
- [Elly In Distance] Polo..

196
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:52,429
- [Jared] I think mom is
close. Let's go find her.

197
00:08:52,429 --> 00:08:54,451
- Ah! Found you!

198
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:55,451
- Found you!

199
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,238
- [Jared] Wow, you are so
much more efficient than I am.

200
00:09:00,238 --> 00:09:01,821
Look at your cart!

201
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,036
- We have a wild one!

202
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,445
- [Jared] Well, we did
have to take a potty break.

203
00:09:04,445 --> 00:09:05,852
- Oh, you did?

204
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:08,011
- I'm gonna pass them
onto you while I catch up

205
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:09,573
and try to make up for lost time.

206
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:11,790
- That's okay, do you
want to help me, Jacks?

207
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,957
No, that's right, yep that's
left. So go and turn left.

208
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:21,158
You got candy canes, you
got the ice cream and treats

209
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:25,064
got toilet paper, drinks,
cleaner, tons of food

210
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,981
down there, crackers...

211
00:09:31,323 --> 00:09:33,048
I needed Jared to come with me today

212
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:34,927
usually I go with the kids, but I needed

213
00:09:34,927 --> 00:09:37,297
Jared to come because I
knew we would do two carts.

214
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:40,211
Because, it's like,
everything, we don't want to

215
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:43,898
have to go into town on
the 26th of December.

216
00:09:43,898 --> 00:09:46,278
We want everything.

217
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:49,111
(Christmas music)

218
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:00,384
- Did you laugh when I yelled out,

219
00:10:00,384 --> 00:10:04,265
"Excuse me sir, you're taking too long"?

220
00:10:04,265 --> 00:10:06,999
Well I think you were the only
one who wasn't thinking that.

221
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,567
I think everyone was
like, "What the heck?".

222
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,097
I mean, look at the size of this receipt!

223
00:10:13,097 --> 00:10:16,931
- [Ellie] It is a nice car. That's funny.

224
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:18,809
- Growing up in my family
we definitely had our

225
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:20,713
favorite Christmas movies that we would

226
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:22,362
watch like, on repeat.

227
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:25,009
One of them was "A Muppet
Christmas Carol" that

228
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:26,471
is a must in the Mecham House.

229
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:28,172
The other one was "It's a Wonderful Life",

230
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:29,913
don't you shake your head at that Ellie!

231
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:31,969
"A Muppet Christmas Carol" is a classic!

232
00:10:31,969 --> 00:10:36,442
- Because both of those movies
I never watched growing up.

233
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:37,396
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

234
00:10:37,396 --> 00:10:38,975
- I need to watch "White Christmas".

235
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,978
- [Jared] "It's a Wonderful Life"?

236
00:10:39,978 --> 00:10:41,303
- Yes, I need to watch that.

237
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:44,362
- Yeah, "It's a Wonderful Life",
"A Muppet Christmas Carol"

238
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:46,362
and, "The Santa Clause".

239
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:49,726
And we are going to watch
"The Santa Clause" tonight.

240
00:10:49,726 --> 00:10:51,368
The first time you boys have ever seen it

241
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,648
and it's going to be a
family tradition for you,

242
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,223
henceforth, forever.

243
00:10:55,223 --> 00:10:58,353
That and "A Muppet Christmas Carol", okay?

244
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,508
You guys having fun with your candy canes?

245
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,151
- I'm playing with mine.

246
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:04,734
- [Jared] Oh yeah, we got
popcorn popping upstairs

247
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,598
we're having a family
Christmas movie night!

248
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,246
- Lately I haven't been loving sweets,

249
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:10,477
like especially chocolate
and stuff, which is

250
00:11:10,477 --> 00:11:13,291
a real sad thing because I love that.

251
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:14,823
But, Bonnie had that
candy at her house and

252
00:11:14,823 --> 00:11:18,057
I ate a few and I was like,
"This tastes so good."

253
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:20,576
So, peanut M&M's are
really good and they're

254
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:23,263
ones that I haven't had
for a while, because

255
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,719
M&M keeps coming out
with like caramel ones

256
00:11:24,719 --> 00:11:27,107
and pretzel ones and all sorts of new ones

257
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,061
that we have been trying
but it's been forever

258
00:11:29,061 --> 00:11:32,946
since I had just a peanut
M&M, so those are good.

259
00:11:32,946 --> 00:11:35,367
That, and oranges, these
little mini oranges.

260
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,798
P.S. we did not name
Calvin after Scott Calvin

261
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,561
on "The Santa Clause"
Calvin's name is Calvin Scott,

262
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:44,087
and we didn't even put
the two and two together,

263
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:45,087
is that not funny?

264
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:48,487
- I totally did and I named
Calvin for that reason.

265
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,829
- And his name's Charlie..

266
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:52,759
- I told you Ellie,
- What?

267
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:54,688
- I've got this all planned out.

268
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:56,309
- Jackson came up with Charlie.

269
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,845
- Who do you think gave him the idea?

270
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:01,733
- We got the kids into bed and now is the

271
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:04,153
time that Ellie and I
are beginning going over

272
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,609
the IVF grants and the applications

273
00:12:06,609 --> 00:12:08,876
- I got my pen.
- You got your pen.

274
00:12:08,876 --> 00:12:11,099
- It's a sperm and an egg, ah,

275
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,789
the sperm got stuck, there we go.

276
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:15,883
- This is an exciting
time and it's kind of a

277
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:18,427
nerve wracking time and
I want you guys to know

278
00:12:18,427 --> 00:12:20,683
that Ellie and I don't take this lightly,

279
00:12:20,683 --> 00:12:23,495
we feel like you are
sharing your very personal

280
00:12:23,495 --> 00:12:27,280
story with us, and we are taking this and

281
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,594
we're trying to make the
best of it that we can.

282
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:32,137
- We have a sheet of paper
for each and every one

283
00:12:32,137 --> 00:12:34,937
of you, just like we did last year.

284
00:12:34,937 --> 00:12:39,477
- That's not even everyone,
this is just the first batch.

285
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:42,121
- We still have last years all together.

286
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:44,109
- I'm just excited to get to know each

287
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,982
and every one of you
applied more and to hear

288
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,612
your story and to connect with you because

289
00:12:49,612 --> 00:12:53,046
It's something amazing when you share this

290
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:56,460
connection, it's just real and personal.

291
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,694
Last clip our battery
died, so sorry about that,

292
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,752
but it's just after 1 A.M.
so Ellie and I are going

293
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,448
to call it quits for the night.

294
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:07,617
Thank you so much for
watching guys, if you enjoyed

295
00:13:07,617 --> 00:13:09,175
the video give it a big thumbs up,

296
00:13:09,175 --> 00:00:00,000
and we'll see you guys tomorrow. Bye.
