1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,775
(somber music)

2
00:00:47,155 --> 00:00:49,405
(laughing)

3
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,541
- He was like waiting.

4
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:56,370
Ewwwa!

5
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,762
(laughing)

6
00:00:57,762 --> 00:01:00,529
I like getting chocolate milk bubbles

7
00:01:00,529 --> 00:01:01,946
all over my head.

8
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:05,956
(gentle guitar music)

9
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:11,662
Penny has arrived.

10
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:14,790
Ladies and gentlemen, Penny has arrived.

11
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,605
That's chocolate milk, not blood.

12
00:01:16,605 --> 00:01:17,949
Good morning guys.

13
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:19,870
Jared ended the vlog yesterday without me.

14
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,061
I was starting to end it,

15
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,862
and then I was getting flustered,

16
00:01:22,862 --> 00:01:24,606
and then I had Jared end it.

17
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:25,909
This morning, we are getting ready

18
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:27,644
to go in to the hospital

19
00:01:27,644 --> 00:01:29,700
so that I can have a D&C.

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,484
I'm not looking forward to it.

21
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:34,108
I'm not quite sure how
to handle my emotions.

22
00:01:34,108 --> 00:01:35,900
Have lots of rage.

23
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,733
(laughs)

24
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:38,132
- [Jared] Well I think part of it is

25
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:40,322
- I laugh because I feel awkward.

26
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:42,021
- I think part of it is that

27
00:01:42,021 --> 00:01:43,856
this ist he last thing that you wanted

28
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:46,344
to have happen in the miscarriage.

29
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:47,792
You wanted to do it naturally,

30
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:48,625
and that didn't work.

31
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:49,697
You wanted to do it with the medicine

32
00:01:49,697 --> 00:01:50,680
and that didn't work.

33
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,993
And now it's like, this
is the last resort.

34
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,712
And it's not a fun resort to go visit.

35
00:01:54,712 --> 00:01:55,951
- No no.

36
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,250
The medicine did a little bit,

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,266
but they need to go in,

38
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:00,324
and we need to do that.

39
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:03,754
I do have a battle
wound forever on my wall

40
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:05,421
that I will look at.

41
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:07,875
There it is, the battle wound.

42
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:11,676
I chucked the camera at it yesterday.

43
00:02:11,676 --> 00:02:13,933
So you guys are good,

44
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:16,130
but I'll forever look at that and

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,619
- [Jared] Remember that one time

46
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:20,534
- I'm not even gonna
patch it, I love it, so.

47
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:21,451
- Memories.

48
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,677
(gentle guitar music)

49
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,188
- I told Jared I'm not doing that again,

50
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,308
in a cleaner version,

51
00:02:56,308 --> 00:02:57,173
but that's how I feel,

52
00:02:57,173 --> 00:02:58,486
so that's what you get.

53
00:02:58,486 --> 00:03:00,221
- The truth hurts, right?

54
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,558
- The nurse is like, she was so cute.

55
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:03,391
- She was.

56
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,270
- She gave me a hug and she was like,

57
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,368
I have had to do this three times

58
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,868
and I am so sorry.

59
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:09,809
It was just cute,

60
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,642
we just had a good conversation.

61
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,417
- She said, I'm not even
gonna ask you how you are.

62
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:13,473
I just know this sucks.

63
00:03:13,473 --> 00:03:14,806
- Yeah, so cute.

64
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,344
Okay, warm side, like that.

65
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,258
- [Nurse] Alright, and
Judy's gonna be your nurse,

66
00:03:30,258 --> 00:03:33,258
she'll be right down.
- It's perfect.

67
00:03:34,825 --> 00:03:37,075
(laughing)

68
00:03:50,352 --> 00:03:51,438
- I just looked at Jared

69
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:53,413
and he's like Ellie you're beautiful.

70
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,953
He said you know what you need to do?

71
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,280
- I said you should
really try and put some

72
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,817
waves in your eyebrows.

73
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,896
- How about when they
give me the anesthesia

74
00:04:01,896 --> 00:04:04,034
and I'm asleep, you do it.

75
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,162
So I can wake up and feel beautiful.

76
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:06,995
Take note.

77
00:04:08,186 --> 00:04:09,459
- Do you have an eyebrow pencil in here?

78
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,147
- [Ellie] No.

79
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:12,182
- I'll be right back.

80
00:04:12,182 --> 00:04:13,794
- [Ellie] But we should,
you should do them.

81
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:15,439
- We should really make
a video of that sometime.

82
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,540
I saw that on something, and I was like,

83
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,295
is that really a trend right now?

84
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,450
- I've thought about it, but I'm like,

85
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,928
but I just don't want to.

86
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,962
But you're good and
artsy, you could do it.

87
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:24,796
- I'll do it for you.

88
00:04:24,796 --> 00:04:26,592
I'll do it for you, okay, for you.

89
00:04:26,592 --> 00:04:27,609
- Thanks.

90
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:28,968
We've been talking about Penny too,

91
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,801
and how funny she is and
how pets are so cute.

92
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:35,763
And Jared put her on our bed last night

93
00:04:35,763 --> 00:04:38,962
and she knew it was something special.

94
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:39,927
It was crazy.

95
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,174
- Cuddled up to us to us like really cute,

96
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:45,666
and was like, I'm up here with you guys.

97
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,249
(tender music)

98
00:04:56,815 --> 00:04:58,204
I'm sorry.
- Come.

99
00:04:58,204 --> 00:04:59,037
- No.

100
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:01,236
- Okay.

101
00:05:01,236 --> 00:05:02,069
- [Jared] Good luck.

102
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:02,902
- Well I wish they
would've put me to sleep

103
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,735
with him in the room.

104
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:04,985
- [Jared] Yeah.

105
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:10,776
(gentle atmospheric music)

106
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,447
(TV in background)

107
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:00,748
(soft crying)

108
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,323
(crying)

109
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,058
- Yeah, thank you, you're so sweet.

110
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:52,164
- Thank you so much.
- Take care, okay?

111
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:54,560
- You're so sweet.
- Thank you so much.

112
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,393
- You alright?

113
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,158
- [Ellie] Yeah.

114
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:57,991
(belt snaps)

115
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,870
- We just got home from the hospital

116
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,373
and Ellie is already
feeling so much better,

117
00:08:02,373 --> 00:08:03,878
her spirits are a lot higher

118
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:06,486
and she is doing really really great.

119
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,627
How are you feeling?
- That could be

120
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:08,585
because I got food in my tummy?

121
00:08:08,585 --> 00:08:09,792
- That is a big part of it.

122
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:10,705
You know what?

123
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:13,061
We have Beau and Emily to thank for that.

124
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:14,441
They sent us an Olive Garden gift card

125
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,855
and we are snacking on the Olive Garden.

126
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:17,766
- So thank you.

127
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:19,574
Bonnie came to say hi.

128
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:21,654
- I felt like I was
being a little intrusive.

129
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:22,487
- [Ellie] Not at all.

130
00:08:22,487 --> 00:08:24,591
- Like I wanted to be
there when you get home,

131
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:26,654
but I just couldn't stand the thought

132
00:08:26,654 --> 00:08:29,526
of your body going through so much,

133
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:30,503
I just wanted to meet you here.

134
00:08:30,503 --> 00:08:31,336
- [Ellie] Well thanks.

135
00:08:31,336 --> 00:08:32,169
- Well thank you guys.

136
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,889
Sometimes I feel like
Bonnie's married to Ellie

137
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:34,773
just as I am.

138
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,225
(laughing)

139
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:38,251
- Well she came in and
she got on the couch

140
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,389
and she goes c'mere c'mere.

141
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,251
Like I'm here.

142
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:43,394
(laughing)

143
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,724
- Bonnie called while
we were in the hospital

144
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,943
and was like, is Ellie having
a hankering for me right now?

145
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:49,158
(laughing)

146
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,782
- I did, I said does she need me?

147
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,699
- I was like, I'm here.

148
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,384
- We did

149
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:57,805
- Now I'm embarrassed.

150
00:08:57,805 --> 00:09:00,055
- We did laugh really hard.

151
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:03,016
- [Jared] It was like a
10 minute conversation,

152
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,252
we were laughing.
- Usually she is.

153
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,085
- [Jared] I know.

154
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:05,918
- I'm so embarrassed.

155
00:09:05,918 --> 00:09:08,845
- Like on a scale of one to
10, how bad does Ellie want me?

156
00:09:08,845 --> 00:09:10,294
(laughing)

157
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:11,127
- It was cute.

158
00:09:11,127 --> 00:09:13,192
- [Jared] It was.

159
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:16,635
- Afterwards though, the
nurses were helping me

160
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,313
and I was on the bed,

161
00:09:18,313 --> 00:09:20,481
and I was like, there's so much blood,

162
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:21,504
I can feel the blood.

163
00:09:21,504 --> 00:09:25,293
And then she's like you
didn't put your pad on right.

164
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,045
(laughing)

165
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,545
So there was like

166
00:09:29,392 --> 00:09:31,500
I was a hot mess, I went to the bathroom,

167
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,489
and they didn't tell me it
was gonna hurt to pee either.

168
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:38,032
They move your bladder or
go around it or whatever.

169
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:41,163
And I tried to pee and I was like no!

170
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,658
It hurt.
- Stop stop stop stop.

171
00:09:42,658 --> 00:09:45,706
- [Jared] This pee is on fire.

172
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,064
- So they said it will
hurt for a little bit.

173
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:48,176
- Yeah.

174
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:50,418
But I'm just happy that Ellie's home.

175
00:09:50,418 --> 00:09:52,016
She's feeling a lot better.

176
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:52,849
We're gonna take it easy

177
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:55,770
for the next couple of days though, okay?

178
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,310
Like I don't want you
doing any jump roping

179
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,273
or anything like that,

180
00:09:58,273 --> 00:10:00,162
that's ridiculous, why would
you even think about that?

181
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:00,995
- I did my laundry,

182
00:10:00,995 --> 00:10:01,828
I did a few loads last night,

183
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:03,468
so I'm gonna just sit.

184
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:04,301
- [Jared] Yep, good.

185
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:05,134
- And you can do the dishes.

186
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:06,628
- I will do the dishes.

187
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:07,785
Do you guys want to stick around

188
00:10:07,785 --> 00:10:09,569
and maybe we could do
some dishes together?

189
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:11,433
(laughing)

190
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:12,652
Oh I was also gonna say

191
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:15,034
the kids are actually
with Grandma and Grandpa.

192
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,666
They have been taking naps,

193
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,275
so this is actually like the perfect time,

194
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,514
when the kids are asleep,

195
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:21,449
Ellie's getting food in her belly,

196
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:23,871
and getting her spirit's lifted.

197
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,180
- Jared said when I was
coming out of the anesthesia

198
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,763
I said, I just want Penny here.

199
00:10:30,123 --> 00:10:32,294
- It was so funny.

200
00:10:32,294 --> 00:10:34,031
You didn't go on about Jackson and Calvin.

201
00:10:34,031 --> 00:10:36,936
You literally said,
and I wish I caught it,

202
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:39,568
I just wish Penny was here.

203
00:10:39,568 --> 00:10:42,921
- Well I think we had been
talking about Penny a lot.

204
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,479
What a sweet girl she is

205
00:10:44,479 --> 00:10:47,479
and how we just like you Miss Penny,

206
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:49,971
Miss pretty Penny.

207
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,733
And she's pretty good in the house,

208
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,405
but I think specifically like right now,

209
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,572
she's been so just mellow.

210
00:10:57,952 --> 00:10:59,688
- I think maybe she kind of, you know,

211
00:10:59,688 --> 00:11:01,256
Dogs are so sweet.
- senses something.

212
00:11:01,256 --> 00:11:03,677
- Dogs are very smart
when there's a crisis.

213
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,444
- Maybe she's just being extra cute

214
00:11:05,444 --> 00:11:07,265
because Dad let you on the bed.

215
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,098
(laughing)

216
00:11:08,098 --> 00:11:09,273
That was hilarious.

217
00:11:09,273 --> 00:11:11,182
Well I think I'm gonna go take a nap

218
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:12,150
- I think that's a great idea.

219
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,814
- [Ellie] and then the kids will be here.

220
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:17,397
(tender music)

221
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:25,842
- Ellie was able to get
a little bit of rest.

222
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:28,338
The kids are home and
we are reunited together

223
00:11:28,338 --> 00:11:29,171
as a family.

224
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:30,539
Hi boys, how's it going?

225
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:31,980
- We're watching Spider-Man.

226
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:34,016
- Yes, and we thought it
would be a great opportunity

227
00:11:34,016 --> 00:11:36,169
for us to watch a movie
together as a family.

228
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:37,731
So we got some popcorn.

229
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,171
Look, it's Mickey Mouse.

230
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:41,050
Grab your popcorn Calvin

231
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,133
and Jackson, here you go.

232
00:11:44,074 --> 00:11:46,132
And Mommy, here you go.

233
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:46,965
- Thanks.

234
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:48,882
- Jackson wanted to watch Spider-Man.

235
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:49,853
And this is the first time we've ever

236
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:51,765
seen a life action movie.

237
00:11:51,765 --> 00:11:54,125
- Actually I want to watch Spider-Man,

238
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,119
because I didn't really want to watch,

239
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,143
Captain Underpants again.

240
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:01,352
But I wanted us to sit
down and enjoy a show too,

241
00:12:01,352 --> 00:12:03,815
so we'll see how they like it.

242
00:12:03,815 --> 00:12:07,982
- [Jared] Yeah, I think
Jackson will love this movie.

243
00:12:16,348 --> 00:12:19,598
(whispers) Yeah he is.

244
00:12:21,093 --> 00:12:24,343
(dramatic music on TV)

245
00:12:29,768 --> 00:12:30,601
yeah.

246
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:33,463
I think it's important to know

247
00:12:33,463 --> 00:12:34,878
that we have been skipping a lot

248
00:12:34,878 --> 00:12:36,254
of the scary scenes,

249
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:39,222
just basically showing
the origin of Spider-Man,

250
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:41,407
not the Green Goblin
or anything like that.

251
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:43,632
Jackson did you like Spider-Man?

252
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:44,465
- Yes.

253
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,302
- [Jared] Was it a good movie?

254
00:12:45,302 --> 00:12:47,934
- Yeah, I don't like when Octopus

255
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,073
- [Jared] Yeah, he was kind of bad, huh?

256
00:12:49,073 --> 00:12:52,105
Did he make bad choices or good choices?

257
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,070
- Bad ones.

258
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,871
- [Jared] Do we make good choices?

259
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:55,798
- Yeah.

260
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:56,645
- [Jared] Good.

261
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,647
- We skipped 90 percent of that.

262
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,583
(laughing)

263
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,063
But it was fun to see
him be excited about it.

264
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:04,023
- Yeah.

265
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:05,705
I mean when Spider-Man
was becoming Spider-Man,

266
00:13:05,705 --> 00:13:07,146
that was pretty cool.

267
00:13:07,146 --> 00:13:07,979
- Yeah.

268
00:13:07,979 --> 00:13:09,777
What was your favorite part of Spider-Man?

269
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,139
- Shooting webs was cool.

270
00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:14,682
- This has been by far the worst week

271
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:16,843
I have ever have,

272
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:19,093
but I do want Jared to know

273
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,585
how much I absolutely love him.

274
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:24,348
I don't feel like

275
00:13:24,348 --> 00:13:25,995
Of course we know it,

276
00:13:25,995 --> 00:13:27,667
but sometimes I don't
feel like I express it

277
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,034
as much as I should.

278
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,016
And I love you.

279
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:32,597
And thanks for being here more for me

280
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:34,366
than I am for you.

281
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:37,913
It's just kind of how it is naturally,

282
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:39,479
but I do love you.

283
00:13:39,479 --> 00:13:41,687
- I love you and I'm always
gonna be here for you.

284
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,836
- [Ellie] Thanks.

285
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:44,584
I love you too.

286
00:13:44,584 --> 00:13:46,428
- Well guys what about me?

287
00:13:46,428 --> 00:13:48,132
You're not talking about
me, what's going on?

288
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:51,078
I want to be included in this.

289
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:51,911
Oh guys.

290
00:13:53,281 --> 00:13:55,247
- My friend friend the other day,

291
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,079
you saw the painting she made.

292
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:59,930
A lot of people wanted
to know her Instagram.

293
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,654
So I'm sure she's okay with it,

294
00:14:02,654 --> 00:14:03,826
but I'm just gonna double check with her

295
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,185
before I say it,

296
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:07,517
and then on Instagram,
when we hang our picture,

297
00:14:07,517 --> 00:14:10,422
I'll definitely make sure
to give her info there.

298
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:12,511
But she gave us a sweet little gift.

299
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:13,344
(Ellie laughs)

300
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:14,177
- Penny.

301
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:16,507
- [Ellie] Awww.

302
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:17,340
- Awww.

303
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,436
- [Ellie] It is so pretty.

304
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,055
- It's like a mini version
of our giant painting.

305
00:14:24,055 --> 00:14:24,888
- [Ellie] I love it.

306
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:26,748
- How cool is that?

307
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:27,768
- [Ellie] Aww, thanks friend.

308
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:29,502
It is beautiful.

309
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:31,588
- She is so talented.

310
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,615
And I can, I think it's fresh.

311
00:14:33,615 --> 00:14:35,727
- Let me (laughs)

312
00:14:35,727 --> 00:14:37,966
Hey I like paint.

313
00:14:37,966 --> 00:14:39,275
- [Jared] Don't sniff too much.

314
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:41,507
- I want to sniff lots.

315
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,739
- It's beautiful.

316
00:14:42,739 --> 00:14:44,249
While it has been a difficult week,

317
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:47,784
I definitely feel like especially today,

318
00:14:47,784 --> 00:14:51,664
I have a really incredible sense of calm

319
00:14:51,664 --> 00:14:53,831
and just a great sense of,

320
00:14:54,913 --> 00:14:57,401
like this is a fresh start, you know,

321
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:00,250
and I don't know if
that's insensitive to say.

322
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:03,374
- Jared asked me that earlier,

323
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,518
and when it's me and you in our home,

324
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:07,215
I know what you mean,

325
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:08,048
- Yeah.

326
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:09,772
- and I hope everyone
portrays that in a good way.

327
00:15:09,772 --> 00:15:12,324
But I know what you mean

328
00:15:12,324 --> 00:15:15,247
and it's been like a drug out week,

329
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,414
and it's been kind of like

330
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:22,212
just a drug out few months anyway.

331
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,164
- When we talked with the
doctor and everything,

332
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:28,022
she was so glad that
we ended up doing this,

333
00:15:28,022 --> 00:15:30,873
because of, just the way things were.

334
00:15:30,873 --> 00:15:32,489
- Yeah the doctor, she said,

335
00:15:32,489 --> 00:15:35,551
I'm really glad that
you ended up doing this,

336
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:39,051
because, she said, you had a lot of tissue

337
00:15:39,886 --> 00:15:42,162
that was very adhered in your lining,

338
00:15:42,162 --> 00:15:44,719
and I'm all over the place right now.

339
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:46,519
And she said that it
wouldn't have been able

340
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:47,862
to pass on its own.

341
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,617
And so this was like the last
thing that I wanted to do.

342
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,603
I hated it, I hated being there.

343
00:15:53,603 --> 00:15:55,393
I hated being cold.

344
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:57,060
I hated, I hated it.

345
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:02,465
- But it was necessary for you to be

346
00:16:02,465 --> 00:16:04,904
in the best condition that you could be.

347
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:07,686
And I think that's why if
feels like a fresh start.

348
00:16:07,686 --> 00:16:08,838
- Yes.

349
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,758
Like I feel at peace knowing

350
00:16:10,758 --> 00:16:14,091
that my body can just recover now fully.

351
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:17,207
I would hate to have thought,

352
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,403
like okay it's probably good

353
00:16:18,403 --> 00:16:20,379
and then have issues or whatever.

354
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:25,257
Just like last time, I
remember just a few days after,

355
00:16:25,257 --> 00:16:28,372
I was like, why am I not blue?

356
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:29,205
Of course I was sad, but I was like okay,

357
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:32,563
and then I remembered
exactly a month later,

358
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:35,281
it was like a rollercoaster,

359
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:37,965
and that's exactly how this will be.

360
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:40,277
I could not help but just love love love

361
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:41,778
on my boys tonight,

362
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:44,945
I do every night, but extra, you know?

363
00:16:46,045 --> 00:16:49,412
Just love my family,
I'm grateful for them.

364
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:50,245
- Well I love you.

365
00:16:50,245 --> 00:16:52,138
- And I'm so grateful
for our extended family,

366
00:16:52,138 --> 00:16:54,020
friends and you guys.

367
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,033
I've learned a lot

368
00:16:55,033 --> 00:16:56,935
and I've asked my doctor
a lot of questions

369
00:16:56,935 --> 00:16:59,879
through information that we've received,

370
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:01,519
and I've got a lot of answers.

371
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,622
We've done lots of blood work.

372
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,757
Just lots and lots and
lots, huh, Miss Penny girl.

373
00:17:07,757 --> 00:17:10,174
- I just wish Penny was here.

374
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:13,454
I love that you said that.
- I did.

375
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:15,412
- She's so sweet.
- That was the sweetest thing.

376
00:17:15,412 --> 00:17:16,883
- I've enjoyed my conversations

377
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:19,906
with my sisters, my sister-in-laws,

378
00:17:19,906 --> 00:17:22,392
my friends, everyone that's been through

379
00:17:22,393 --> 00:17:24,647
miscarriages or haven't.

380
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:28,070
I feel like miscarriages
gets talked about,

381
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:29,447
because it's like oh I had a miscarriage,

382
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:33,370
but I feel like sometimes
people do it so nonchalantly.

383
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,425
It's the most painful thing

384
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:36,924
that I have ever experienced.

385
00:17:36,924 --> 00:17:41,088
This was by far more painful than my last.

386
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:41,921
My last I felt it in my back,

387
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:43,016
but this was

388
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:43,849
- Something else.

389
00:17:43,849 --> 00:17:44,682
- This was something else

390
00:17:44,682 --> 00:17:45,893
and I don't know if it was because

391
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:46,852
I was further along

392
00:17:46,852 --> 00:17:48,155
or if my body was trying to get rid

393
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:50,107
of that lining that wasn't

394
00:17:50,107 --> 00:17:51,033
I don't know,

395
00:17:51,033 --> 00:17:54,457
but this has been an excruciating week.

396
00:17:54,457 --> 00:17:56,933
We're gonna go ahead and say goodnight.

397
00:17:56,933 --> 00:18:00,600
And can't wait to watch
101 movies tomorrow.

398
00:18:02,236 --> 00:18:03,574
I'm looking forward to it.

399
00:18:03,574 --> 00:18:04,858
- Absolutely.

00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:07,978

- We'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Maybe take two.

410
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:27,696
(laughing)

411
00:18:27,696 --> 00:18:29,175
- Have a great weekend.

412
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,851
- The doctor's like, do
you have enough at home,

413
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:32,846
and I'm like nope, give me more.

414
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:33,810
I won't abuse them.

415
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,713
- Good, I'm glad.

416
00:18:35,713 --> 00:00:00,000
- Okay, we'll see ya, bye.
- Okay, bye.
