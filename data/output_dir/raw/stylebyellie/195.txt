1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:01,486
- Ride the train?

2
00:00:01,486 --> 00:00:03,518
- [Jared] Yeah, we're gonna ride a train!

3
00:00:03,518 --> 00:00:05,797
You excited to ride the train?

4
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,880
- Ride train!

5
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:10,816
(cheerful music)

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,560
- Good morning everybody!

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,784
We are getting ready to go home today.

8
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,738
I have a new video that just went out.

9
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,098
It is a post workout smoothie.

10
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:24,294
Go check it out.

11
00:00:24,294 --> 00:00:26,585
Jackson, I do have a
question for you though.

12
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:29,144
What happened last night?

13
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:30,977
- I got the rainstorm,

14
00:00:31,848 --> 00:00:33,515
and I went upstairs,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,480
and I cried for mom!

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,915
And there was a rainstorm
and I cried for mom.

17
00:00:42,915 --> 00:00:45,582
And I hide under mommy's pillow.

18
00:00:47,905 --> 00:00:50,907
And I was sneaking under there.

19
00:00:50,907 --> 00:00:52,812
And I was not scared!

20
00:00:52,812 --> 00:00:53,712
- [Ellie] Good!

21
00:00:53,712 --> 00:00:54,998
Oh my goodness.

22
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:57,575
Usually when the kids
cry, I wake up right away.

23
00:00:57,575 --> 00:01:00,034
But for some reason, I was dreaming,

24
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:01,927
but I could hear you crying.

25
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:04,013
And then it was when you
got to the top of the stairs

26
00:01:04,013 --> 00:01:04,864
and really cried

27
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:05,736
is when I heard you.

28
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:07,510
So I ran upstairs,

29
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,180
and there was lightning all over here,

30
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,952
it was windy, and it
was very scary for you.

31
00:01:12,952 --> 00:01:13,785
- Yeah.

32
00:01:13,785 --> 00:01:14,913
- [Ellie] But we're good now, huh?

33
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:16,255
- Yeah, I was not scared

34
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:19,005
when I sneaked under your pillow.

35
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,159
- Good morning guys.

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,170
Today is the day that we
leave and we head home.

37
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:26,301
We've got all of our luggage here

38
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:28,432
ready to get packed in the van.

39
00:01:28,432 --> 00:01:31,322
And I was thinking sometimes
it can be a bittersweet feeling

40
00:01:31,322 --> 00:01:33,085
seeing all of your luggage like that.

41
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:34,042
Good sweet feeling

42
00:01:34,042 --> 00:01:35,594
because it's finally time to go home,

43
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,318
get back into that normal routine,

44
00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:39,941
bitter because yore leaving your family,

45
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:40,937
and you're not sure

46
00:01:40,937 --> 00:01:42,563
when you're exactly gonna see them again.

47
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:44,068
But we had a great time

48
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:47,315
and I am excited to take the
boys on an airplane ride!

49
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,604
Woah there, partner!

50
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:51,780
Do you even know the speed limits?

51
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,055
Do you even got your license, buddy?

52
00:01:54,055 --> 00:01:55,178
- You should put your
seatbelt on, let's go!

53
00:01:55,178 --> 00:01:56,191
- [Jared] That's a good point.

54
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,785
Okay, drive us away buddy!

55
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,687
Just keep it in between
the lines, all right?

56
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,437
(cheerful music)

57
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,967
- [Ellie] All right, can
everyone do the Maggie move?

58
00:02:15,967 --> 00:02:17,425
(Ellie laughs)

59
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:19,011
- [Child] I'm doing the Maggie move.

60
00:02:19,011 --> 00:02:19,942
- [Ellie] Maggie, show
them your best dance move!

61
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:21,609
Everyone's doing it!

62
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:25,693
Okay, we all gotta give hugs and kisses!

63
00:02:25,693 --> 00:02:27,943
Say goodbye to our cousins!

64
00:02:35,466 --> 00:02:38,171
- Plane! Plane plane plane!

65
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,646
- My family's so stinking cute.

66
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:40,759
The boys are holding hands.

67
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,509
- Plane!
- Do you see a plane?

68
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:44,462
- Yes. Plane plane.

69
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,986
- Do you know that we're gonna go on one?

70
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:47,035
We're at the airport!

71
00:02:47,035 --> 00:02:48,544
- [Ellie] Hold my hand, let's go!

72
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:49,377
- [Jared] You ready to get on an airplane?

73
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:50,767
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

74
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,732
Well actually, we've got like two hours

75
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:54,011
before we're gonna get on the airplane.

76
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,885
We're super early to the airport (laughs)

77
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:58,218
(kids yell)

78
00:02:59,498 --> 00:03:00,683
so I imagine there's
gonna be a lot of that

79
00:03:00,683 --> 00:03:02,396
for the next two hours, Ellie.

80
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:03,385
- So we'll go gear up,

81
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:04,602
buy a Coke or something.

82
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,435
- Yes.

83
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,547
So the roles have reversed.

84
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:09,159
This time it was me who got checked.

85
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:10,843
Well actually, it was Ellie's bag.

86
00:03:10,843 --> 00:03:12,036
She left a Gatorade in there.

87
00:03:12,036 --> 00:03:13,212
Did you guys get caught?

88
00:03:13,212 --> 00:03:14,045
- Yes, I did.
- Oh!

89
00:03:14,045 --> 00:03:16,716
- I had a bottle of water
that I totally forgot about.

90
00:03:16,716 --> 00:03:18,553
- See, okay, so it's not only me.

91
00:03:18,553 --> 00:03:20,629
- So I took out Dad's Dr Pepper,

92
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:23,298
but I forgot that I had a
bottle of water in there.

93
00:03:23,298 --> 00:03:26,048
(cheerful music)

94
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,341
- [Jared] Hey Jackson, is
that our airplane right there?

95
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:43,174
- Yeah!

96
00:03:43,174 --> 00:03:44,686
- [Jared] Are you excited to go on it?

97
00:03:44,686 --> 00:03:45,519
- Yeah.

98
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,514
- [Jared] Where should we go?

99
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,358
- Home!

100
00:03:47,358 --> 00:03:48,339
[Jared] Yeah!

101
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,589
Did you hear that, mom?

102
00:03:49,589 --> 00:03:51,047
Captain Jackson's taking us home.

103
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:52,423
- So glad there's no tears!

104
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:53,288
(Jared laughs)

105
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:54,610
- That's the captain.

106
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,996
- [Jared] That is the captain.

107
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:57,741
Don't you wanna be a captain too?

108
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:58,944
- No.

109
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:00,246
- [Jared] Do you wanna fly the airplane?

110
00:04:00,246 --> 00:04:01,913
- No, I'm too small.

111
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:04,719
- [Jared] You are?

112
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,552
- [Ellie] When you're older.

113
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:06,385
- Yeah.

114
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,218
- Give me your ticket.

115
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:11,919
- [Jared] Thank you.

116
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,572
Thank you, let's go bud!

117
00:04:13,572 --> 00:04:14,874
- We're on the airplane!

118
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:15,906
- [Jared] We're getting on the airplane!

119
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:18,022
Are you gonna ask the
pilot if you can help fly?

120
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:18,855
- No.

121
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,986
(Jared laughs)

122
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:22,373
- [Jared] He is drifting.

123
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:23,980
He is drifting in your arms.

124
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,230
Thank goodness!

125
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:28,022
Okay Jackson, now's your chance!

126
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:30,390
Do you want to ask him
if you can fly the plane?

127
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,600
- [Flight Attendant] You wanna fly it?

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,889
- [Jared] Do you wanna go fly the plane?

129
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:33,722
- No!

130
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:36,327
(laughter)

131
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:40,246
- He says, I'm too little, I'm too little!

132
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:42,898
We're about to take off on
our first flight of the day.

133
00:04:42,898 --> 00:04:44,068
It's the longest flight,

134
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:45,882
and I have a couple keys to success

135
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:46,996
for handling a flight

136
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:49,052
when you have two kids
that are a little ornery.

137
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:51,885
First key to success, dried fruit.

138
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:57,026
Second key to success,
pretzels with chocolate.

139
00:04:58,588 --> 00:05:01,088
Third key to success, chewies.

140
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,448
Fourth key to success,

141
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:07,296
caramel M&M's.

142
00:05:07,296 --> 00:05:10,546
Fifth key to success, more dried fruit.

143
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:15,863
Sixth key to success, a flight manual.

144
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,567
And naptime.

145
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,400
- It's amazing

146
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,068
how you can have a
conversation with somebody,

147
00:05:20,068 --> 00:05:21,301
especially a toddler,

148
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:23,407
using your eyes.

149
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,797
So Calvin's asleep

150
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,295
and Jackson's kind of
trying to wake him up.

151
00:05:26,295 --> 00:05:27,212
And I look at Jackson,

152
00:05:27,212 --> 00:05:28,243
and I went...

153
00:05:28,243 --> 00:05:29,887
And jackson went...

154
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:31,333
And I went...

155
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,825
And he went...

156
00:05:32,825 --> 00:05:34,447
(Jared laughs)

157
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:35,680
And it was so funny,

158
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,638
and I just had to laugh

159
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:38,904
because it was totally
just all in the eyes,

160
00:05:38,904 --> 00:05:40,359
but we had a conversation.

161
00:05:40,359 --> 00:05:42,539
- Tell me something with your eyes.

162
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,872
- Show me that you're happy.

163
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:47,774
Show me that you're mad.

164
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,420
Yeah.

165
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,151
The boys had a great flight.

166
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,360
We are on to the next.

167
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,573
They're a little restless.

168
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:55,495
So am I.

169
00:05:55,495 --> 00:05:56,708
Yeah, it's a good thing
we have a little layover.

170
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:58,191
They can get their legs moving.

171
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,677
- The movies were nice to have,

172
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,015
but Jackson has this game

173
00:06:01,015 --> 00:06:03,615
that he always plays
on the iPad on Sundays,

174
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,948
like for church.

175
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:10,312
It's a puzzle, a number
game, a matching game,

176
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:11,619
and some other game.

177
00:06:11,619 --> 00:06:14,636
It's all in one, and the kids love it, so.

178
00:06:14,636 --> 00:06:15,725
That was fun.

179
00:06:15,725 --> 00:06:16,953
On to the next flight.

180
00:06:16,953 --> 00:06:18,693
- One down, one to go.

181
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:21,140
- (gasps) Are you okay?
- My nose!

182
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,363
Am I bleeding?

183
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:24,106
- [Ellie] It hit your hat.

184
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:25,089
At the beginning of the trip,

185
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:28,421
everybody had so much
spunk and excitement.

186
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,798
The end of the trip, they
are not holding their bags

187
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:34,291
and they want daddy to pull them.

188
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:36,666
That's just what he is going to do.

189
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,594
How come you're so nice?

190
00:06:37,594 --> 00:06:38,625
- Cuz I love my family.

191
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:39,899
Look how cute these guys are.

192
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,204
- [Ellie] Isn't it funny how
at the beginning of the trip,

193
00:06:41,204 --> 00:06:43,813
everyone's like, I'm excited,
I'm gonna pull my bag!

194
00:06:43,813 --> 00:06:44,758
- I'm gonna pull my own bag!

195
00:06:44,758 --> 00:06:48,347
Five minutes later,
expectations versus reality!

196
00:06:48,347 --> 00:06:49,290
- Ride the train!

197
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:51,041
- [Jared] Yeah, we're gonna ride a train!

198
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,561
You excited to ride the train?

199
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,644
- Ride train!

200
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:57,120
- [Jared] You got him? (laughs)

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,953
- Yeah!

202
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:00,449
- Is this exciting?

203
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,427
- Yeah!

204
00:07:01,427 --> 00:07:03,177
- [Jared] Here we go!

205
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:10,131
(cheerful music)

206
00:07:29,223 --> 00:07:31,671
So Calvin ran into this
store three different times

207
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:33,494
and he was like, dog dog dog!

208
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,621
And we're just like what?

209
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,854
There's no dogs in that store, Calvin.

210
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:38,993
What are you doing?

211
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,018
And then we take a closer
look on the third time,

212
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,955
and there are these little
tiny stuffed animal dogs.

213
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:45,731
Like keychains.
- Just tiny!

214
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:49,011
- And he spotted them every
single time we passed by.

215
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:50,289
And we were like-- oh!

216
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:51,896
- [Ellie] Oh, did we...

217
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:52,729
Are you okay?

218
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:55,286
(Jared laughs)

219
00:07:55,286 --> 00:07:56,205
- [Ellie] I could hear that.

220
00:07:56,205 --> 00:07:58,389
So Calvin got that,

221
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:01,244
and then Jackson got a pillow,

222
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:03,373
but it's a Jackson Storm pillow,

223
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:04,560
so it's like a pet and a pillow.

224
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,422
So that will be nice for Jackson to have.

225
00:08:06,422 --> 00:08:09,411
And he's been feeding grandma
and grandpa an ice cream cone.

226
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,653
Show us what you've been doing.

227
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:12,641
Can I have a bite?

228
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:14,114
Mmmm!

229
00:08:14,114 --> 00:08:14,947
Thank you!

230
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:18,464
(babbling)

231
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,381
- Someone has too much
energy at nine at night.

232
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:26,011
Well I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.

233
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,563
The good news is we made it
off the plane safe and sound.

234
00:08:28,563 --> 00:08:29,735
Everything was great.

235
00:08:29,735 --> 00:08:32,232
The plane was smooth, the kids did great.

236
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:35,616
We made it to the van,
and the battery's dead.

237
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,862
We cannot start our van.

238
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,876
- Do we need some more gas?

239
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:39,874
- [Jared] Um, almost.

240
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,272
I think our battery's dead.

241
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:43,568
We just need to get a jumpstart, buddy.

242
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:44,641
- Jumpstart?

243
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,188
- Yeah, I think that's all.

244
00:08:46,188 --> 00:08:47,572
I hope that's all.

245
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:49,054
If it's just a dead battery,

246
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:51,670
then that's actually
the best case scenario.

247
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,797
If it's something else,

248
00:08:52,797 --> 00:08:54,647
then I have no idea what it would be.

249
00:08:54,647 --> 00:08:56,181
- We need somebody to jump us.

250
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:57,216
- Well dad went downstairs

251
00:08:57,216 --> 00:08:58,729
to go see if they have a battery

252
00:08:58,729 --> 00:09:00,330
or if someone has jumper cables,

253
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,465
so we'll see.

254
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:02,822
Cross our fingers.

255
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:06,153
(quiet music)

256
00:09:06,153 --> 00:09:08,736
- [Ellie] Our help has arrived!

257
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:10,610
Yay!

258
00:09:11,836 --> 00:09:14,336
(quiet music)

259
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:18,726
- Yes!

260
00:09:18,726 --> 00:09:20,415
We got it to start!

261
00:09:20,415 --> 00:09:21,248
Yay!

262
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:25,271
We made it home!

263
00:09:25,271 --> 00:09:28,146
I have to be so quiet,
because everyone's asleep.

264
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,751
I wanted to give a quick story

265
00:09:29,751 --> 00:09:30,897
of what happened.

266
00:09:30,897 --> 00:09:33,189
So we got off the airplane,
we went to the car,

267
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:34,981
and I was trying to get
the clicker started,

268
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,369
and I was like what the heck?

269
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:37,870
I'm pretty sure we're on this floor.

270
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,923
We may be on the floor above,

271
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,551
as far as the parking garage.

272
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:42,553
Clicking and clicking
and nothing is happening.

273
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:44,300
And I was like I think
the van's right over here.

274
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,983
So I went there and nothing was going on.

275
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:48,383
I was like what the heck?

276
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:50,647
Tried opening the door
and nothing was happening.

277
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,876
I was like, oh crap, the
battery must be dead.

278
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,232
So while we're looking into it,

279
00:09:54,232 --> 00:09:57,471
dad went downstairs to get
someone from the rent-a-car place

280
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,650
to see if they have jumper
cables or anything like that.

281
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:03,649
One truck ended up coming to help us.

282
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:05,088
For some reason the jumper cables

283
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,075
weren't doing the best thing,

284
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:09,034
and so he called another guy.

285
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,189
He's like, you know what,

286
00:10:10,189 --> 00:10:13,450
I think this is so dead that
it needs something else.

287
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:16,608
So he called a third person to come up

288
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,156
and they used a generator to start it.

289
00:10:19,156 --> 00:10:23,532
And this whole process
took just about two hours.

290
00:10:23,532 --> 00:10:26,135
So we were in the parking
garage for about two hours

291
00:10:26,135 --> 00:10:27,795
just because the battery had died.

292
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,229
And I think honestly,

293
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,980
a light was left on or
something like that,

294
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,004
or someone bumped the car
and the alarm went off

295
00:10:35,004 --> 00:10:36,779
and just killed the battery.

296
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,732
And that's what it was.

297
00:10:38,732 --> 00:10:41,404
For two hours though, that was crazy.

298
00:10:41,404 --> 00:10:44,610
So we made it home, we're safe and sound.

299
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,804
We are so tired.

300
00:10:45,804 --> 00:10:47,013
It's past midnight.

301
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:48,267
We are going to sleep.

302
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,407
We had a great time,

303
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,764
but that was kind of like the
worst part of the whole trip.

304
00:10:52,764 --> 00:10:54,149
So thank you guys for watching.

305
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:55,752
If you enjoyed our vacation,

306
00:10:55,752 --> 00:10:57,116
give it a big thumbs up.

307
00:10:57,116 --> 00:10:58,344

Bye.
