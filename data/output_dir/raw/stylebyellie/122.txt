1
00:00:00,209 --> 00:00:02,792
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:10,507 --> 00:00:12,577
- [Jared] Are you ready for this?

3
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:13,410
Hey.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,243
- Garland, wreath?

5
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:18,001
- Wreath, garland, whatever
the crap that think is called.

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:20,816
Ellie it has been here far too long,

7
00:00:20,816 --> 00:00:22,620
so I have a wonderful idea.

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,419
Would you accompany me with this?

9
00:00:24,419 --> 00:00:25,750
- Christmas music?

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,500
- Hey Google, play some
holiday music for us.

11
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,981
- [Google Home] Sure, here's
a Google play music station

12
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:35,466
called feel good classic cottage rock.

13
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:36,299
(laughing)

14
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:37,777
- That wasn't what you asked.

15
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:39,520
- Let's try that one more time.

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,680
(festive jazzy music)

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,875
There we go.

18
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:45,067
That's what I'm talking about.

19
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:45,900
- Let's show Daddy our dance.

20
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,659
♪ Oh the weather outside is frightful ♪

21
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:48,918

(Calvin fusses)

24
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,333
- [Jared] Did you just hip check him,

25
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,688
because you wanted him to move his hips?

26
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:59,064
♪ Let it snow, let it snow let it snow ♪

27
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,027
- Okay, show him your dance.

28
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:02,464
- [Jared] C'mon let's dance Cal.

29
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,188

34
00:01:15,989 --> 00:01:16,851
(laughs)

35
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,518
Just a minute, I'm prepping him.

36
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:22,725
(Jared laughing)

37
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:23,601
You ready?

38
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,898
Let's do it together.

39
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:25,731
- No.

40
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,862
♪ Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ♪

41
00:01:28,862 --> 00:01:30,925

44
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,053
- That's alright, there's only room

45
00:01:38,053 --> 00:01:39,043
in this party for two.

46
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,465
- I told him.

47
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:42,807
♪ Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ♪

48
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:45,413
♪ Ooh wee, 'cause it's snowing ♪

49
00:01:45,413 --> 00:01:47,280
- I can't believe you told him that.

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,301
(snapping fingers)

51
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,385
♪ Let it snow, let it snow ♪

52
00:01:50,385 --> 00:01:51,953
(Ellie laughs)

53
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:53,011
- Okay, let's put

54
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,235
the garland up.
- Let's do it.

55
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,485
(bright holiday music)

56
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:11,300
- I am not Scrooge, I am not the Grinch,

57
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,958
but there's a couple Christmas songs

58
00:02:15,958 --> 00:02:18,070
that I just cannot stand.

59
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,367
And if you're listening closely,

60
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,478
it's playing in the background right now.

61
00:02:21,478 --> 00:02:23,727
I love Paul McCartney.

62
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,082
♪ Sing their song ♪

63
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:29,473
("Wonderful Christmastime" playing)

64
00:02:29,473 --> 00:02:31,265
The reason I can't stand this song,

65
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:34,725
is it's very petty, it's very lame,

66
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:38,398
but it got to the burning of my soul

67
00:02:38,398 --> 00:02:41,148
and just incinerated it to death!

68
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,792
I worked at Red Robin
when I was in high school

69
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:46,570
for three years,

70
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,123
and every Christmas, they
have the Christmas album,

71
00:02:50,123 --> 00:02:52,814
and it's the same 15 Christmas songs.

72
00:02:52,814 --> 00:02:54,561
But it always seemed like every other

73
00:02:54,561 --> 00:02:58,049
Christmas song was this Paul
McCartney Christmas song.

74
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,617
And I can't handle it anymore.

75
00:03:00,617 --> 00:03:03,867
It has stained this song for me forever

76
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,335
and every time it comes on,

77
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:08,818
I cringe and I weep for my soul

78
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,032
and I try and hit the next button

79
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:12,448
as fast as I can.

80
00:03:12,448 --> 00:03:14,096
But on the other hand,

81
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:17,449
this is one of Ellie's
favorite Christmas songs.

82
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,392
So I'm so conflicted.

83
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:22,188
- You will like it and you will play it.

84
00:03:22,188 --> 00:03:23,297
(Jared laughs)

85
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:24,318
- [Jared] Do you have any Christmas songs

86
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,566
that you just hate?

87
00:03:25,566 --> 00:03:27,134
- No.

88
00:03:27,134 --> 00:03:27,967
No.

89
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:28,800
- No, 'cause you're an angel.

90
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,415
- I really like Trans-Siberian Orchestra.

91
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:31,735
- [Jared] Yeah, do you want to know why?

92
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:32,568
- Why?

93
00:03:32,568 --> 00:03:33,689
- Because you're an angel Ellie.

94
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,104
You're a freaking angel,

95
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:37,583
that doesn't hate anything of course.

96
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,847
Do you have any Christmas songs

97
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,623
that you just can't stand anymore?

98
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,703
Let me know in the comments down below.

99
00:03:42,703 --> 00:03:46,120
(bright Christmas music)

100
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,643
- [Ellie] The garland is done.

101
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:58,626
We had one piece left,

102
00:03:58,626 --> 00:04:01,053
so we put it under this.

103
00:04:01,053 --> 00:04:04,570
Yay, it's feeling so
festive in here, arrr!

104
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,362
(laughs)

105
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,815
- [Jared] It's so festive,
I could kill, aye!

106
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:10,132
- I just love it.

107
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:12,022
Hey Calvin,
- Hey Mommy.

108
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:13,646
- Hey, Calvin, this is,

109
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:16,511
he loves to move the bar stools all around

110
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:18,391
and he always barricades himself in.

111
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:19,921
And he also runs and hides under there,

112
00:04:19,921 --> 00:04:21,416
when he's in trouble.

113
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:23,297
What did he, what has
he been getting trouble

114
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,156
What has he been getting in trouble?

115
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:25,989
What?
- For.

116
00:04:25,989 --> 00:04:26,969
- What has he been getting

117
00:04:26,969 --> 00:04:27,854
What has he?

118
00:04:27,854 --> 00:04:30,104
(laughing)

119
00:04:31,526 --> 00:04:34,315
What has he been getting
in trouble for a lot is,

120
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,698
he loves the soap dispenser

121
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:38,096
and then we have bath soap

122
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:40,128
in my bathroom that's a soap dispenser

123
00:04:40,128 --> 00:04:40,961
and then I have lip gloss

124
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:41,977
that's kind of like a dispenser.

125
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:42,810
(sighs)

126
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:44,767
- Anything with a push down.

127
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,119
- I think today, I've had to get upset

128
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,120
with him a few times,

129
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,423
and I've had to clean
up tons of his messes

130
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,068
and that's where he runs to hide, as well.

131
00:04:53,068 --> 00:04:55,733
- [Jared] Look, he's made
himself a half circle.

132
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,316
- [Ellie] I'm gonna get you.

133
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:58,149
(Calvin laughs)

134
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,585
Yeah, you better hide.
- Ahhhh!

135
00:05:00,585 --> 00:05:03,783
- [Ellie] You see that
lipstick on your face,

136
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:05,192
that you put on your face?

137
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:08,108
That was mine and you put it on my bed

138
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,194
and it's like I've been with the kids,

139
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,532
it's not like I'm not watching them,

140
00:05:12,532 --> 00:05:14,309
like I was folding laundry,

141
00:05:14,309 --> 00:05:16,425
it's those two seconds that you're not

142
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:18,585
eyeballs on them the whole time,

143
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,312
that he's destructive.

144
00:05:20,312 --> 00:05:22,368
I don't know, I was
literally putting socks away

145
00:05:22,368 --> 00:05:23,928
and he was right by me.

146
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:25,031
- And you know what?

147
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,767
That's the thing though is like,

148
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,274
we're doing the best we can.

149
00:05:28,274 --> 00:05:29,320
And you need to remember that,

150
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,832
you are doing the best you can.

151
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:32,353
- [Ellie] Oh yeah.

152
00:05:32,353 --> 00:05:33,406
- These things happen.
- Crap happens.

153
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:37,200
- It was so funny hearing
stories about my brother.

154
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,608
He knocked down the
Christmas tree one year.

155
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:41,590
He was hanging on a fence one time

156
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,445
and Ruby had pulled him down,

157
00:05:43,445 --> 00:05:44,677
he was like Jackson's age,

158
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:48,270
maybe even younger,
totally split his lip open.

159
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:50,166
Jared has a cousin, she's always telling

160
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:53,094
the funniest, but like, it's not funny

161
00:05:53,094 --> 00:05:55,833
in the moment stories of her little boy

162
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,900
doing things, it's like--

163
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,693
- Get a close up of his lipstick.

164
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,930
Can you show us your lipstick?

165
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,148
- [Ellie] Is that my purple lipstick?

166
00:06:02,148 --> 00:06:04,571
Did you try eating it?

167
00:06:04,571 --> 00:06:05,414
We're good?

168
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:06,664
- Are you good?

169
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,231
- [Ellie] Gosh.

170
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,644
(Calvin laughs)

171
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,681
- Ooh Mom took it.

172
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:16,898
Say bye Mom.

173
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:18,260
- [Ellie] Should've danced.

174
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,388
- Oh that's right.

175
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:20,429
You should've danced.

176
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:22,032
- Okay, do you want it?
- So you want to dance?

177
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,904
- Calvin do you want it?

178
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:24,737
- [Ellie] Let's dance.

179
00:06:24,737 --> 00:06:26,559
- [Jared] Okay you gotta dance.

180
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,684
- [Calvin] No.
("Little Drummer Boy" playing)

181
00:06:27,684 --> 00:06:28,692
- [Ellie] Dance first.

182
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:29,595
Shake your hips.

183
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:33,752
Look at that face, he's
like leave me alone.

184
00:06:33,752 --> 00:06:35,360
(Ellie laughing)

185
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,492
♪ The new born king to
see par rum pum pum pum ♪

186
00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,677
Next up in the decorating process

187
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,855
has nothing to do with
Christmas decorations.

188
00:06:43,855 --> 00:06:45,438
Stop, stop bumping.

189
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,931
Get your rumpabumbum away from here.

190
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:50,964
That hallway right there,

191
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:54,004
I want to put pictures one above

192
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:56,032
and under, one all along the hallway.

193
00:06:56,032 --> 00:06:58,135
- Can I put my plant back?

194
00:06:58,135 --> 00:06:59,844
- So we're gonna put,

195
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:00,858
we gotta find pictures
to put in the frames.

196
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:02,085
- Can I take my plant back now?

197
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,301
- [Ellie] Yeah please do.

198
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:05,187
- This is my office plant

199
00:07:05,187 --> 00:07:06,582
for my office, thank you.

200
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:08,530
- [Ellie] Here Calvin, I
want to ask you something.

201
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,363
Don't tell me what letter this is,

202
00:07:09,363 --> 00:07:12,252
I'm gonna see if Calvin knows, okay?

203
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,396
Okay, Calvin, Calvin,

204
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:17,086
do you know what letter that is?

205
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:17,919
- E.

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,017
- E.

207
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,847
We've been going over his letters everyday

208
00:07:20,847 --> 00:07:24,475
and it's been been fun, because
Calvin will repeat them,

209
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:27,190
and usually even, he usually doesn't say

210
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,941
every single one of them is E,

211
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:30,229
but when he actually sees E,

212
00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:31,842
he knows that it's E, so
I thought that was funny.

213
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:33,425
I am very impressed

214
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:37,741
with your handwriting skills, Mr. J.

215
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,430
Is this fun for you to do,

216
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,335
or is it work?

217
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:44,168
- Work.

218
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:46,084
- [Ellie] It's work?

219
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:48,633
Hmmm, I thought that it would be fun.

220
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:49,689
You seemed to be excited to do it.

221
00:07:49,689 --> 00:07:51,154
- I missed one, B.

222
00:07:51,154 --> 00:07:52,348
- I've got a game in mind,

223
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,786
that we're all gonna play
together as a family.

224
00:07:54,786 --> 00:07:55,946
Does that sound good?

225
00:07:55,946 --> 00:07:56,779
- What is it?

226
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:57,618
What was it?

227
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:58,728
- [Jared] Do you want to know?

228
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,561
- Mmm-mmm.

229
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,453
- Okay, let me go get
it, and we'll get ready,

230
00:08:00,453 --> 00:08:01,882
and then we'll play it, okay?

231
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:02,720
- I need to finish my letters.
- His eyebrows

232
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,553
- [Jared] are everything right now.

233
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:04,439
- Mine?

234
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,831
- His?
- What, his.

235
00:08:05,831 --> 00:08:07,868
- I need time to finish my letters first.

236
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:08,701
- [Jared] Okay, finish your letters.

237
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,743
How fun is that, he wants
to do his homework first.

238
00:08:10,743 --> 00:08:12,349
Like how cute.

239
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:14,182
His eyebrows were like

240
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,268
Alright ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,

241
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:18,592
who's ready to play a game?

242
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:19,425
- Me.

243
00:08:20,449 --> 00:08:23,183
(Ellie laughs)

244
00:08:23,183 --> 00:08:27,494
- The name is Larry
Culpepper and I don't lose.

245
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:28,804
Alright?

246
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:30,421
I've got my fanny pack,
I've got my headphones,

247
00:08:30,421 --> 00:08:32,756
I've got my all-access pass.

248
00:08:32,756 --> 00:08:34,647
All-access means all the time.

249
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:36,299
- [Ellie] Are you ready to play?

250
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,988
Does Daddy look funny?

251
00:08:37,989 --> 00:08:38,822
- Yeah.

252
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,131
- [Ellie] Alright what's the game?

253
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:41,542
- Wait first, where's the Dr. Pepper?

254
00:08:41,542 --> 00:08:42,375
(Ellie laughs)

255
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,251
- Jackson loves surprises and games

256
00:08:44,251 --> 00:08:46,106
and he always closes his eyes,

257
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,738
so he can be really surprised.

258
00:08:47,738 --> 00:08:49,321
He loves surprises.

259
00:08:50,234 --> 00:08:52,282
And these are our little markers

260
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,250
that we're gonna put on our paper.

261
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,605
Where's the paper?
- You know what?

262
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:57,522
- I forgot.

263
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:02,259
I got my Dr. Pepper right here.

264
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:04,128
Let me go get the papers,

265
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,045
name's Larry Culpepper.

266
00:09:09,457 --> 00:09:10,997
It is an honor to be playing this game

267
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:11,918
with you guys here.

268
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:12,751
- [Jackson] What?

269
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,757
- [Ellie] The lighting looks so yellow.

270
00:09:13,757 --> 00:09:14,590
- Who are you?

271
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,013
- Who am I?

272
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,210
I'm Larry Culpepper,

273
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,123
- [Ellie] Here Cal.

274
00:09:18,123 --> 00:09:20,283
- the greatest Dr. Pepper
fan there ever has been

275
00:09:20,283 --> 00:09:21,864
and ever will be.

276
00:09:21,864 --> 00:09:22,697
Do you know that?

277
00:09:22,697 --> 00:09:23,530
- Yeah.

278
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,947
- You want to try my glasses?

279
00:09:28,553 --> 00:09:30,898
I wanted to wear this for Halloween.

280
00:09:30,898 --> 00:09:32,502
Guess what, so here's the story.

281
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:34,124
So I was streaming on Twitch the other day

282
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,043
and I was streaming as Larry Culpepper.

283
00:09:37,043 --> 00:09:38,564
I had the costume on and everything,

284
00:09:38,564 --> 00:09:40,035
and it was so funny.

285
00:09:40,035 --> 00:09:42,811
And the story is, I got this costume

286
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:43,916
because I tweeted about it

287
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,811
and Dr. Pepper sent it to me.

288
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,507
This is the power of the internet.

289
00:09:47,507 --> 00:09:49,184
And how awesome Dr. Pepper is.

290
00:09:49,184 --> 00:09:50,029
(laughing)

291
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,309
- It is Thanksgiving week.

292
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:54,609
We are wanting to get into the spirit.

293
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:55,967
We are playing some bingo.

294
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,133
(Calvin yells)

295
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:57,966
The kids love,

296
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,387
this is their favorite thing,

297
00:09:59,387 --> 00:10:02,595
is that when we sit down
and play games with them

298
00:10:02,595 --> 00:10:03,970
and bingo's fun.

299
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,202
- Yeah, especially when
your markers are edible.

300
00:10:06,202 --> 00:10:07,035
- [Ellie] Okay.

301
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:08,827
- [Jared] Alright first
one ladies and gentlemen,

302
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:09,660
we've got a turkey.

303
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,884
Yeah, good job Calvin,
put it in your free spot.

304
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:11,871
- [Ellie] Turkey, do you have a turkey?

305
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:13,009
I don't have a turkey.

306
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:13,842
- [Jared] You don't have a turkey?

307
00:10:13,842 --> 00:10:14,675
Yes you have a little turkey.

308
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:16,580
Wait, let me see your turkey Ellie.

309
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,429
Sorry, uncooked turkey.

310
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:19,262
(laughing)

311
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,253
- Gobble gobble gobble.
- Oh.

312
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:22,516
Uncooked turkey.
- I want a turkey.

313
00:10:22,516 --> 00:10:23,758
- [Ellie] Oh that's a turkey.

314
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:26,690
- That's kind of sad that
we have to specify that.

315
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,190
Let's go with hay.

316
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:31,949
- I have hay, I have hay.

317
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:33,182
- [Jared] You have hay?

318
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,106
- [Jackson] Yep.

319
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:35,095
- [Jared] Let's see, hay, okay,

320
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:36,893
I'm one away on this one.

321
00:10:36,893 --> 00:10:39,810
Jackson, do you have five in a row?

322
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:43,878
What do you say?
- I missed it.

323
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,492
- Bingo!

324
00:10:45,492 --> 00:10:47,967
- Yay, Jackson got a bingo.
- Let's see.

325
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,634
- You do have bingo.

326
00:10:50,628 --> 00:10:52,142
- [Jared] Yay, you win a prize.

327
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,276
- He always get the
first bingo, high five.

328
00:10:54,276 --> 00:10:56,465
- [Jared] Where were you
on the Disney cruise dude?

329
00:10:56,465 --> 00:10:58,953
- I know, we could've
won done those dollars.

330
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:00,860
Do you have a box of apples Calvin?

331
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,188
- Oh I have a box of apples.

332
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:04,236
- [Ellie] Box of apples.

333
00:11:04,236 --> 00:11:05,069
Let's see where you put it.

334
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,572
Do you have apples on there?

335
00:11:07,572 --> 00:11:08,606
Right there.

336
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,285
So we called them

337
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:12,284
and you got all of them by yourself

338
00:11:12,284 --> 00:11:13,163
in the right spot.

339
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:15,271
- I got three and a half.

340
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:17,920
- [Ellie] Okay, pumpkin, orange pumpkin.

341
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,753
- [Jackson] Oh I have an orange pumpkin.

342
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:21,178
- [Ellie] Good job Calvin.

343
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:22,291
- [Jackson] Did he get a bingo?

344
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,656
- [Ellie] Not quite yet, good job.

345
00:11:23,656 --> 00:11:24,625
You're gonna go get our dinner?

346
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,169
- Yeah, I gotta grab my wallet though.

347
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:27,002
- He's going that way.

348
00:11:27,002 --> 00:11:28,395
We invited Jared's parents for dinner

349
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,618
tonight for Thanksgiving.

350
00:11:29,618 --> 00:11:32,389
We are gonna be at my
parents house this year,

351
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:35,515
so we're gonna do a
little hangout tonight and

352
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:36,348
I figured

353
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:37,686
- It's pre-Thanksgiving.

354
00:11:37,686 --> 00:11:40,123
- Rememer when Calvin
wouldn't dance earlier?

355
00:11:40,123 --> 00:11:42,068
I'm gonna get him.

356
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:44,687
(blowing recorder)

357
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,937
(laughing)

358
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,703
- Bye.

359
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:50,814
Ta-da.

360
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:53,897
(bright jazzy music)

361
00:11:54,761 --> 00:11:57,344
(Ellie laughs)

362
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,375
- [Ellie] He throws a beat.

363
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,292
Yay Calvin.

364
00:12:08,326 --> 00:12:09,993
Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo.

365
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,762
(Ellie laughs)

366
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:17,989
(bright jazzy music)

367
00:12:21,914 --> 00:12:23,053
- [Jared] Alright.

368
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:24,710
- What's going on?

369
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,642
- [Jared] Are you being silly?

370
00:12:25,642 --> 00:12:27,371
Oh he's silly and naked.

371
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,854
Oh he's got a diaper on, we're okay.

372
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:29,829
(Calvin fusses)

373
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:32,348
- He was naked and then
he goes to your mom.

374
00:12:32,348 --> 00:12:36,180
- [Jared] Calvin can you come
say goodnight to Grandpa?

375
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,097
(kiss)

376
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:41,173
- Calvin, do you want to know something?

377
00:12:41,173 --> 00:12:42,988
Do you know what my grandpa would do

378
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:44,137
to me all the time.

379
00:12:44,137 --> 00:12:46,399
And I don't know if I'll
ever be able to do this.

380
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,768
Is my grandpa would give me hugs

381
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,725
and he would rub his cheek on mine

382
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:53,279
and it would sting so bad

383
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,325
from the whiskers.

384
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:57,908
He would just have such sharp whiskers.

385
00:12:57,908 --> 00:12:59,510
And I think that's what
happened when he hugged you,

386
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,101
is like he was like ow.

387
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:02,080
- Ow.

388
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,879
- [Jared] Did that hurt?

389
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:05,882
Ready set
- Hold him down

390
00:13:05,882 --> 00:13:07,578
- while I
- Tickle, tickle,

391
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:08,607
- [Jared] tickle, tickle.

392
00:13:08,607 --> 00:13:09,781
- Good night, love you.

393
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:10,614
- Love you.
- Too.

394
00:13:10,614 --> 00:13:11,447
- You know how we were talking

395
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:12,624
about biggest pet peeves the other day?

396
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:14,077
- Yes, tell me more.

397
00:13:14,077 --> 00:13:16,491
- I've notice with vlogging,

398
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:19,524
people hate when people chew food.

399
00:13:19,524 --> 00:13:21,851
I stopped chewing gum forever ago.

400
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:23,133
And that is annoying.

401
00:13:23,133 --> 00:13:23,966
And you don't think it's annoying,

402
00:13:23,966 --> 00:13:25,052
until you watch someone.

403
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,388
I agree, it's annoying.

404
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,380
You know what else is annoying?

405
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,213
- What?

406
00:13:28,213 --> 00:13:30,516
- Picking or touching at your lip.

407
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,756
I am so mad at myself,

408
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:35,260
I just watch our video
that's gonna go up tomorrow

409
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,439
and I was like, I wish
Jared could cut those out

410
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,569
but he can't cut those out,

411
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,738
or the whole video will be cut out.

412
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,071
I licked my lip 1,000 times,

413
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:50,169
and I just thought, I already
know all of the comments

414
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:53,180
are gonna be, and I
already know how I feel.

415
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,930
I just annoyed a thousand people.

416
00:13:57,248 --> 00:14:00,625
I just pissed off a thousand people.

417
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:04,042
You do things that you don't even realize

418
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,368
that you do.

419
00:14:06,368 --> 00:14:07,848
Filming myself for four years

420
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:11,424
and watching myself, I have learned

421
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:12,795
that I say things differently,

422
00:14:12,795 --> 00:14:15,068
some of which I'm not
changing because I love it.

423
00:14:15,068 --> 00:14:17,617
I lick my, I'm so mad.

424
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:19,408
- You've got a cold sore,

425
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:20,836
and you're addressing it.
- But I can't help it.

426
00:14:20,836 --> 00:14:22,199
- Even if someone if someone was like,

427
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:23,253
ew, you should do that, don't do that,

428
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,586
I can't help it.

429
00:14:26,402 --> 00:14:30,163
It's just there, and I just
do that 1,000 times a day.

430
00:14:30,163 --> 00:14:31,311
- You know what's funny though?

431
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:32,420
- I'm so annoyed with myself.

432
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:35,589
- I edited that video,
and we had 10 minutes

433
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:37,747
of footage in that spot,

434
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:38,580
and I never noticed it.

435
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,522
- Well I'm glad you didn't,

436
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:42,418
but the whole time I was like oh Ellie.

437
00:14:42,418 --> 00:14:44,954
And when we did that food video.

438
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:45,787
- Yeah.

439
00:14:45,787 --> 00:14:46,620
- The taste challenge.

440
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,952
I didn't look at those
comments for like a week later.

441
00:14:48,952 --> 00:14:51,571
Life got crazy, but I ended up going back

442
00:14:51,571 --> 00:14:52,871
and like looking at it,

443
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,853
and I was like uulll.

444
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,009
And I didn't watch that video

445
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,741
and then when I watched it,

446
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,399
oh that, I was really

447
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,647
smacky and annoying,
(Jared smacks)

448
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,421
but when I'm talking and eating,

449
00:15:04,421 --> 00:15:05,771
you don't even put the two together.

450
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,100
- You just don't even think about it.

451
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,484
- And I was like oh Ellie.

452
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:11,100
There's so many things that we do

453
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,543
that I've improved on,

454
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,164
and so many things that I have more to do.

455
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,233
But that's one thing
I love about the vlog,

456
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:18,866
I feel like I've become a better person,

457
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:19,953
because I've actually been able

458
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,681
to watch myself grow,

459
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:22,755
is that the weirdest thing in the world?

460
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,099
- No.

461
00:15:24,099 --> 00:15:25,763
- Even if you guys don't want a vlog,

462
00:15:25,763 --> 00:15:28,513
like even if you don't upload,

463
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:30,846
I really truly challenge you

464
00:15:31,737 --> 00:15:35,070
to do it on your phone four times a day.

465
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:37,587
Film a little clip.

466
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:38,420
Just try.

467
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,948
It'll break you out of your shell,

468
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,604
even if you don't think you have a shell.

469
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:43,948
It'll break you out.

470
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:46,451
You'll be able to look at
yourself and you will be able

471
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:49,293
to see things that you
like about yourself.

472
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:51,345
You'll be able to see
things you don't like

473
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:52,868
about yourself, that you want to change.

474
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,573
It is the most bizarre thing

475
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:56,674
that you don't even realize

476
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,161
until you do it.

477
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:58,994
- Right.

478
00:15:58,994 --> 00:16:01,002
- Half the times, like I'll say something

479
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:03,178
that totally didn't make sneeze,

480
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,536
sounded dumb--

481
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:06,201
- But in your head it makes sense.

482
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:07,397
- Yes.
- Right?

483
00:16:07,397 --> 00:16:08,230
- Yeah.

484
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,076
- It's weird.

485
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:12,414
So first, I'm sorry about
all the lip licking.

486
00:16:12,414 --> 00:16:14,804
I annoyed the crud out of myself,

487
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:17,778
let alone I can't image how
people are gonna feel with that.

488
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:18,611
Anyway--

489
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,780
- Wait, real quick.

490
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,613
- That was my spiel.

491
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:21,942
- So that makes me wonder,

492
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:23,936
what quirks do I have, like on the video,

493
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:26,349
what do I do that you're like oh Jared.

494
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:27,674
- Maybe this?

495
00:16:27,674 --> 00:16:28,560
- Do I do this a lot?

496
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,062
- I think you grab your hair, but

497
00:16:31,062 --> 00:16:32,242
- Well it's just really fun to touch.

498
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,406
- But I don't think it's a big quirk,

499
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:34,733
but I do think you touch it.

500
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:36,356
I've tried to make a mental note,

501
00:16:36,356 --> 00:16:38,196
to not like, and I just did.

502
00:16:38,196 --> 00:16:39,583
I've made a mental note to myself

503
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,437
to not grab my hair,

504
00:16:41,437 --> 00:16:43,214
because it is flustering

505
00:16:43,214 --> 00:16:44,955
watching a video and the whole time

506
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:47,038
the girl's looking like--

507
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:48,771
- Or.

508
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:50,970
- I really try, I know, I know,

509
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,803
I know, I know.

510
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:52,834
None of us are perfect.

511
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,996
We just need to know that.

512
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:55,212
(laughs)

513
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:57,308
I really am annoyed with myself though.

514
00:16:57,308 --> 00:16:58,462
I'm gonna be better.

515
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:01,295
Okay, thank you guys for watching.

516
00:17:02,158 --> 00:17:03,877
We had a great day with the kids.

517
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,053
- Your hair gets caught in my whiskers.

518
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:07,409
- Just eat my hair.

519
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:08,888
Penny was a good girl today.

520
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:10,554
- She was so sweet today.

521
00:17:10,555 --> 00:17:11,617
- She was good.

522
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:13,896
I don't know why I said
that, it's just been fun.

523
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:16,094
- Tomorrow is her on year anniversary

524
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:19,723
of being a Mecham family
member, part of the Mecham clan.

525
00:17:19,723 --> 00:17:21,692
- Can't wait, bye.
- Have a wonderful day.

526
00:17:21,693 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
