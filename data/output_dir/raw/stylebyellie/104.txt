1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,880
(bright music)

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,754
- Shhh, oh.
- Dad!

3
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:07,253
- What?
- I can't even see anything.

4
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:10,336
- I know why you wanted to come over.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,046
Good morning guys, we had a very pleasant

6
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:17,158
surprise this morning.

7
00:00:17,158 --> 00:00:19,288
Jackson came up to me and he said Dad,

8
00:00:19,288 --> 00:00:21,149
I want to do something today

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:23,053
and what do you want to do young man?

10
00:00:23,053 --> 00:00:25,845
- I want to go to Grandma
and Grandpa Mecham's house.

11
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:27,997
- You want to go to Grandma
and Grandpa Mecham's house?

12
00:00:27,997 --> 00:00:29,485
Well I think that's a fun idea.

13
00:00:29,485 --> 00:00:31,189
It was the sweetest thing ever.

14
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,349
He came up to me while I
was working in the office

15
00:00:33,349 --> 00:00:34,845
and he was like, Dad, will you please

16
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,525
take me to Grandma and
Grandpa Mecham's house

17
00:00:36,525 --> 00:00:38,404
so I can have a spicy drink?

18
00:00:38,404 --> 00:00:41,223
They have like this fruit juice
that has carbonation in it

19
00:00:41,223 --> 00:00:42,056
or something like that,

20
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:44,584
like V8 Splash or something that he loves.

21
00:00:44,584 --> 00:00:46,218
I want to go over there
and have a spicy drink

22
00:00:46,218 --> 00:00:49,140
and cuddle with Grandma and Grandpa.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,636
And I was like that's
the sweetest thing ever.

24
00:00:51,636 --> 00:00:52,596
Do you know you're the sweetest

25
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:54,097
thing ever Jackson?
- Yeah.

26
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:55,328
- [Jared] So what did we do?

27
00:00:55,328 --> 00:00:56,853
Did we ask Grandma and Grandpa?

28
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:57,686
- Yeah.

29
00:00:57,686 --> 00:00:58,519
- [Jared] How did we ask them?

30
00:00:58,519 --> 00:00:59,853
- We Facetimed them.

31
00:00:59,853 --> 00:01:03,137
- [Jared] Yeah we Facetimed
them and what did they say?

32
00:01:03,137 --> 00:01:03,970
- Yes.

33
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:05,385
- They said yes.

34
00:01:05,385 --> 00:01:07,580
And so we are going to drop Jackson off

35
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:08,422
at Grandma and Grandpa's house,

36
00:01:08,422 --> 00:01:09,943
so he can have a spicy drink

37
00:01:09,943 --> 00:01:13,345
and cuddle with Grandma and Grandpa.

38
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,695
Okay, let's go.

39
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,463
Let's go young man, are you ready?

40
00:01:16,463 --> 00:01:17,296
Okay.
- Yeah.

41
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:18,129
- And the shoes.

42
00:01:18,129 --> 00:01:20,431
- Thank you, you are so sweet.

43
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:23,766
He's been so patient, yet not quite

44
00:01:23,766 --> 00:01:25,783
so patient, because he's
been asking every second,

45
00:01:25,783 --> 00:01:26,943
it's like are you ready yet Dad?

46
00:01:26,943 --> 00:01:28,223
Can I help you with anything?

47
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:29,455
Can I get your shoes?

48
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,288
Let's go.

49
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:32,245
He's so anxious to go and I love it.

50
00:01:32,245 --> 00:01:33,343
(Jared laughs)

51
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,865
I know why you wanted to come over.

52
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:37,818
Hey, you have fun with
Grandma and Grandpa, okay?

53
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:38,651
- Okay.

54
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:40,089
- He just, he knew what he wanted to do

55
00:01:40,089 --> 00:01:41,376
when he woke up today.

56
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,860
And that was come over to
your house and hang out like,

57
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,847
you guys must be pretty cool or something.

58
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,157
- We love it.

59
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,157
- Hey, what's happening?

60
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,396
- [Jared] Is she moving the bed for you?

61
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,229
- Hey.

62
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:56,222
- Okay bye buddy, have fun.
- Bye.

63
00:01:56,222 --> 00:01:57,676
- [Jared] Love you.

64
00:01:57,676 --> 00:01:59,202
- Love you.

65
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,035
- This is a great Christmas song.

66
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:00,954
- Oh yeah,

67
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,515
we've got the Christmas
tunes going right now guys.

68
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:04,447
We got the Christmas tunes.

69
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:06,439
Are you feelin' it Calvin?

70
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,949
You feelin' it Penny?

71
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:09,156
Yeah, come here.

72
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:10,555
Good girl.

73
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,795
Oh yeah, feelin' the Christmas tunes,

74
00:02:12,795 --> 00:02:14,140
that's for sure.

75
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,755
That's a good girl.

76
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:18,251
- Calvin and I were so hopping,

77
00:02:18,251 --> 00:02:19,443
we totally dropped one of those.

78
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:20,640
- [Jared] Oh is that what happened?

79
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,836
- Yep, we were dancing.

80
00:02:21,836 --> 00:02:24,794
- Well when I came in, it was the--

81
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:26,569
♪ This Christmas, ♪

82
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:27,551

83
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,826
and Ellie and I just started like,

84
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:29,816
we just started thumping and dancing.

85
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,649
- Busting it out.
- Bouncin'.

86
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:33,953
- We were busting it out
and having a good time.

87
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,193
Weren't we Penny?

88
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:36,802
Yeah we were, huh?

89
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:38,614
Okay show me Penny, Penny show me,

90
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:40,261
can you get in your place?

91
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,619
Good girl, that's a good girl,

92
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,370
and right into a default down position,

93
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,537
that's great!

94
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:48,787
(bright festive music)

95
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,220
(laughing)

96
00:03:00,385 --> 00:03:02,729
- Are you gonna help me film?

97
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:04,290
Are you gonna help me?

98
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,321
Are you gonna help me?

99
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
- No.

100
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:07,147
- No.

101
00:03:07,147 --> 00:03:07,980
- Don't.

102
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,258
- We are feeling the
Christmas spirit today.

103
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,451
I got my red lips on,
(festive music)

104
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:13,733
we have some Christmas music on.

105
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,566
It's very soft,

106
00:03:14,566 --> 00:03:16,771
and Jared and I just got
done filming a little bit

107
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:18,365
of my pregnancy update.

108
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,547
I wanted to find a cute way

109
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:23,451
that I wanted to do the pregnancy updates

110
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:26,423
and I hope that you guys
like it and think it's cute.

111
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:29,171
- And that involves
smelly gross boiled eggs.

112
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,006
- It's good.
- Blech.

113
00:03:31,006 --> 00:03:31,967
- It may taste good,

114
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,428
but the smell of it is just nasty to me,

115
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:36,050
I don't know how people like it.

116
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,883
- I don't think it's bad.

117
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,740
Do you like scrambled eggs?

118
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,543
- I love scrambled eggs.

119
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:41,063
I love eggs, but not hard boiled eggs.

120
00:03:41,063 --> 00:03:43,680

Yay Mom victory,

150
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:37,440
I'm trying to be quiet.

151
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,426
'Cause I don't want to bug
him or him be like, Mama.

152
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,174
'Cause he's in the mode.

153
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,696
Calvin is going to the bathroom.

154
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:49,598
Just a teeny update with potty training.

155
00:05:49,598 --> 00:05:51,465
I haven't like full force,

156
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:53,580
been like we're doing it and the diapers

157
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,846
are out of the house.

158
00:05:54,846 --> 00:05:57,788
And that's probably
the way I should do it.

159
00:05:57,788 --> 00:06:00,479
I don't know, there's probably
a hundred people that think

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,816
I'm doing it way wrong,

161
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:03,775
but we're easing into it,

162
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,310
but Calvin is going potty
and I'm so proud of him.

163
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,908
But I definitely felt like
I should just have him

164
00:06:07,908 --> 00:06:09,291
sit on the potty and I was like,

165
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,928
okay, I'm gonna go get you your prize

166
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,233
for when you go.

167
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,423
And I left, and I haven't come back

168
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:14,901
and I know he's still going

169
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,647
and I'm so proud of him.

170
00:06:16,647 --> 00:06:17,503
(Ellie laughs)

171
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,295
She looks sad.

172
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,022
She came out of there so slow.

173
00:06:21,022 --> 00:06:22,850
- Oh 'cause she was asleep.
- Hi.

174
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,769
- I was playing her to sleep.
- Aww.

175
00:06:24,769 --> 00:06:26,369
- Shh, Oh.
- Dad!

176
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:29,055
- [Calvin] Dad, did the poo.

177
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,625
- Did you go poo?

178
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,771
- [Calvin] Yeah.

179
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,604
- You did?

180
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,631
So our neighborhood is doing
a little Christmas party

181
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:37,822
get together tonight,

182
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,550
and they have asked me to play the guitar.

183
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,269
Every time I get the camera out,

184
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:43,583
Penny goes like a little crazy.

185
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,476
Hey, that's my hat.

186
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:46,049
They have asked me to play guitar

187
00:06:46,049 --> 00:06:47,643
at this get together,

188
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:50,083
and so I was like, okay I've
got to practice a little bit.

189
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,433
I've got to get some things going,

190
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:52,691
because it's been awhile
since I played guitar

191
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,524
in front of people

192
00:06:53,524 --> 00:06:54,569
and frankly I'm a little nervous.

193
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:55,794
But I needed the amp,

194
00:06:55,794 --> 00:06:56,627
because I guess there's gonna be

195
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:58,301
about 90 to a hundred people there

196
00:06:58,301 --> 00:06:59,778
and I plugged in my amp,

197
00:06:59,778 --> 00:07:01,828
and the battery is dead
on my acoustic guitar,

198
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,969
so we're gonna have to run to the store

199
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:05,921
to get a battery Ellie.

200
00:07:05,921 --> 00:07:07,449
We gotta run to the store.

201
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:09,761
- [Ellie] Can you guys see the fog?

202
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:12,369
- What?
- I can't even see anything.

203
00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:13,734
- [Jackson] I can't see anything.

204
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,211
- It is so foggy.

205
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:19,378
When Jared edits, which
is 99.9% of the time,

206
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,073
Penny lays at his feet.

207
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,573
When I'm editing--

208
00:07:28,465 --> 00:07:31,212
- [Jared] She's right there by your feet.

209
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:34,456
- I'm actually gonna edit
the next two days' vlogs,

210
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:36,123
- [Jared] While I work on something else.

211
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,425
- We'll see how I can
make it, it's midnight,

212
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,696
because Jared has some
work that he's gonna do.

213
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:45,214
And I'm like well, that way
he's not up 'til like four.

214
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,586
How about I take half the work?

215
00:07:47,586 --> 00:07:49,680
- Taking some of the
load off my shoulders,

216
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,965
I love it.
- We're gonna do teamwork.

217
00:07:50,965 --> 00:07:52,534
- [Jared] Teamwork makes the dream work.

218
00:07:52,534 --> 00:07:54,142
- Until I fall asleep.

219
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:56,075
- Frankly I'm surprised you're still awake

220
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,099
as it is,
- I know.

221
00:07:57,099 --> 00:07:58,816
It's nearly midnight.

222
00:07:58,816 --> 00:08:00,513
It's six minutes until midnight.

223
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:01,553
Here's the deal yo.

224
00:08:01,553 --> 00:08:04,626
So we had our little neighborhood
Christmas party today

225
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:07,025
and I played the guitar

226
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,186
and I did terrible.

227
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,433
Like I really really did bad,

228
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:11,232
I messed up a lot.

229
00:08:11,232 --> 00:08:13,982
- You messed up but it was jokey,

230
00:08:15,334 --> 00:08:16,775
- Yeah it was fine.
- it was fun.

231
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:19,064
- But I need to redeem myself,

232
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:22,740
so I'd like to play a portion
of the song for you right now.

233
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,331
So get comfortable, put
your listening ears on,

234
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:29,380
close your eyes and enjoy the music.

235
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,130
("Silent Night")

236
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,326
- [Ellie] He acts cocky
when he's in his own house.

237
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:47,671
He didn't act like this tonight.

238
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:50,254
(Ellie laughs)

239
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:03,146
Oh my, I think you're
just playing it thick.

240
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:37,848
("Angels We Have Heard on High")

241
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,699
Are you really concentrating?

242
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:48,532
- Yeah.

243
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,163
Now I'm not.

244
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,746
- [Ellie] I was like,
is he trying to poop?

245
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,778
Cute puppy.

246
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:04,345
("The Little Drummer Boy")

247
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:12,389
When Jared was playing this tonight,

248
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:14,544
it was at the church, our friends had it

249
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:16,016
at the church tonight,

250
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,474
and Jackson had a cookie and went up Jared

251
00:10:18,474 --> 00:10:21,891
at the very end and waited
for him to take a bite,

252
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:22,724
and then at the end,

253
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:23,959
Jared took a big ole bite of the cookie

254
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:24,915
and everyone laughed,

255
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,735
because he was just like waiting for Dad

256
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:29,712
to take a bite of the cookie.

257
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,664
And when you started this,

258
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:33,414
and he goes, bum bum.

259
00:10:34,385 --> 00:10:35,993
'Cause it's the Rum pa bum song, you know,

260
00:10:35,993 --> 00:10:37,501
the Drummer Boy,

261
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,600
and he laughed.

262
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,046
That it is from us to you.

263
00:10:41,046 --> 00:10:43,748
We'll see you tomorrow, bye.

264
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:46,267
- [Jared] Bye buddy,
hope you find your dad.

265
00:10:46,267 --> 00:10:48,369
- [Ellie] Goodnight pretty girl.

266
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:50,786
I didn't mean to wake you up.

267
00:10:52,904 --> 00:10:53,737
Goodnight.

268
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:56,096
- [Jared] Goodnight sweet prince.

269
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:58,011
- [Ellie] Gosh, she's so sensitive.

270
00:10:58,011 --> 00:10:58,976
When you walked out of the door,

271
00:10:58,976 --> 00:11:00,472
you should've seen her face.

272
00:11:00,472 --> 00:11:02,366
- Oh, as soon as I get up to leave,

273
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,038
she is right by my side.

274
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:04,871
- And I was I here,

275
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,025
and I was like Penny it's okay, just wait.

276
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:07,326
And I was in here and I waas like,

277
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:09,073
Penny, it's okay, just wait.

278
00:11:09,073 --> 00:11:09,906
And Jared went into the garage,

279
00:11:09,906 --> 00:11:11,547
you could hear all this ruckus,

280
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:13,403
and she was like,

281
00:11:13,403 --> 00:11:15,304
and then she darted from my hand out,

282
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,330
'cause she just wanted to be in the action

283
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,499
or wanted to know what was going on.

284
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:21,854
- She follows me wherever
I go in the house

285
00:11:21,854 --> 00:11:22,715
and it's sweet.

286
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:24,452
- [Ellie] It is very cute.

287
00:11:24,452 --> 00:11:25,718
But this is like the fourth time

288
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:29,173
she's fallen asleep and I don't
want to bug her, goodnight.

289
00:11:29,173 --> 00:00:00,000
- Okay, thank you for watching, bye.
