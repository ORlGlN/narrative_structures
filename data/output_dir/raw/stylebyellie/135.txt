2
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,476
- We're off! We're going!

3
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:27,758
13 hours baby.

4
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,190
We had a little mishap with seating.

5
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:37,221
- Well what happened was, we had the issue

6
00:00:37,221 --> 00:00:39,464
like a week ago where
they canceled all of our

7
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:42,810
seats and we had to
rebook our seats twice?

8
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,643
- Three times.

9
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:45,232
- Three times.

10
00:00:45,232 --> 00:00:46,801
- Bonnie was clearly back by his self.

11
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,976
- Ellie and I were on the
ends and luckily no one

12
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:51,682
showed up here in the middle so Bonnie

13
00:00:51,682 --> 00:00:53,611
came up here and Jole is just sitting

14
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:54,611
right there.

15
00:00:55,543 --> 00:00:59,573
We're close but not as
close as we'd wanna be.

16
00:00:59,573 --> 00:01:02,235
- 13 hours? You ready for this?

17
00:01:02,235 --> 00:01:04,063
- You have your melatonin?

18
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,868
Your Advil, snacks, crackers,
water, and pair of headphones.

19
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,785
- Super Mario Brothers.

20
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,011
Do you want the air on?

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,756
I can't reach it.

22
00:01:20,756 --> 00:01:23,555
- I just picked my nose.

23
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:27,638
- Jace that is not where
the salad dressing goes.

24
00:01:29,592 --> 00:01:30,704
Your pants are not salad.

25
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:31,871
- I am so red.

26
00:01:34,363 --> 00:01:35,196
- Can you believe that?

27
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,029
- He take his shoes off?

28
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:38,120
- No look at his pants.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,787
- Oh, that's cause of his shoes.

30
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,217
- It's all over his pants.

31
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:47,300
- Class, it's just class.

32
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:54,937
- We all made it.

33
00:01:54,937 --> 00:01:56,483
Jace and Rachel.

34
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,008
- We're here!

35
00:01:58,008 --> 00:01:59,841
- Hi! Bonnie and Jole.

36
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:02,676
We just made it to the hotel.

37
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:05,759
We flew for 17 hours in the airplane.

38
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:10,176
- But we're in China, isn't this amazing?

39
00:02:10,176 --> 00:02:13,848
- [Elle] This is amazing.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

40
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,200
I don't know where I'm going but

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,048
this is all so beautiful.

42
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:21,363
We're staying here for
the first two nights.

43
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,613
Wow! That wall is stunning.

44
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:29,146
It's like gold foil. Look at that wall.

45
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,044
- [Jared] Isn't that amazing?

46
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:33,542
- [Elle] This is stunning.

- [Jared] Carved out by hand.

00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:36,647
- Wow! K.

49
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,386

Hope I'm saying this right.
We are in Ghaungzhou.

52
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:49,361
- [Jared] Ghaungzhou.

53
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:50,194
- Ghaungzhou.

54
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:51,027
- [Jared] Ghaungzhou.

00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,461

This is out our bedroom window.

58
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,992
It's supposed to be really
hot and humid today here.

59
00:02:59,992 --> 00:03:01,017
We are going to be going to a place

60
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:05,026
that's really cold and a
place that's really warm.

61
00:03:05,026 --> 00:03:07,062
- This is crazy! We
are in China right now!

62
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,460
But here's the craziest thing,

63
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,425
we left Utah on November first.

64
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,564
We woke up and it's November third.

65
00:03:14,564 --> 00:03:17,143
We lost November second, I
have no idea where it went.

66
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:19,190
- We will never get it back.

67
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,023
- [Jared] No we won't.

68
00:03:20,023 --> 00:03:22,255
- We had an awesome day traveling.

69
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:26,422
It is 7:30am here but it is
5:30pm where the kids are at.

70
00:03:28,048 --> 00:03:31,715
And this is our hotel
room, this is our bed,

71
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:35,376
this is amazing! It's beautiful!

72
00:03:35,376 --> 00:03:36,880
We are going to be in
a few different hotels,

73
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,986
this is definitely the
nicer one that we will be

74
00:03:39,986 --> 00:03:42,103
in this week. It's awesome!

77

78

is why we are here in China.

- I was totally going to jump in.

83

- Do it again! Do it again!

85

- Jace and Rachel! Okay.

- Left side? I can't do left side.

87

I've ever seen in my life.

- Our friend Jace and not his spouse.

94

- You can tell she's disappointed
when this vein comes out.

are here with them and

I can compare it to CES,

how many sections are there?

123

- 52?

00:05:58,498 --> 00:05:59,331
- [Jared] Yeah.

126
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,164
- Something like that.

127
00:06:00,164 --> 00:06:01,414
- [Jared] Geez.

- [Jole] There you go!

chest strap would be really nice.

the only thing missing.

You're ready for school.

133

- (Jole laughs)

135
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:20,243
- I'm moving and this is all
my, everything that I own.

136
00:06:20,243 --> 00:06:21,967
- [Jole] They said you could
only fit it in one carry on.

137
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,634
They didn't say how big
the carry on could be.

138

- [Elle] Oh my!

143
00:06:32,186 --> 00:06:33,468
- Wait til it does it on your hands.

144
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:34,529
- [Elle] I think your mom's gonna

145
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:35,940
want you to bring one home.

146
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,899
- If it was in the airplane I will.

147
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,254
Seriously I feel like I'm going

148
00:06:40,254 --> 00:06:44,316
to go into hibernation
mode an lose it all.

149
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:45,149
- Oh my!

150
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,520
- [Elle] It's rubbing your hands.

151

- That is a face I don't
ever want to see again.

152
00:06:53,473 --> 00:06:55,776
- [Elle] It's on your feet.

153

- Your chest is shaking.

154
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,124
- Remember when we went on that

155
00:06:58,124 --> 00:06:59,561
cruise and we got massages?

156
00:06:59,561 --> 00:07:00,482
- [Elle] Yeah.

157
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:01,315
- This is already better.

158
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:02,400
- [Elle] (Gasps)

159
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,600
- [Jared] You need to tell me what you're

160
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,955
actually feeling and what it's really like

161
00:07:05,955 --> 00:07:07,004
and don't hold back.

162
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,189
- Everyone makes really
weird creepy faces.

163
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,472
- [Jared] But you'll know why soon, k?

164
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,124
It tilts back and everything.

165
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:15,775
It's the most incredible thing.

166
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:18,212
My mom would die for one of these.

167
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,007
- Oh my gosh! My feet!

168
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,503
- [Jared] Doesn't it feel so good?

169
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:24,503
- Yes! Oh it's like rubbing my feet!

170
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:31,259
I love it! They talk about
buying it in a group.

171
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,439
- [Jared] I know.

172
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,354
- They have a client that's buying some.

173
00:07:35,354 --> 00:07:37,007
- Elle and I were the first
one's to get our food.

174
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:39,701
We got our food at the
Bruce Lee store, which

175
00:07:39,701 --> 00:07:43,388
I think is the coolest thing in the world.

176
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:44,601
We're trying to save tables because

177
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,644
we've got a huge group with us.

178
00:07:45,644 --> 00:07:48,819
So Elle's sitting over there gonna save

179
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:51,629
all these tables. Bruce Lee store.

180
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:53,775
That's good food right?
That's like the best.

181
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,641
- It's one of the bigger
fast food chains in China.

182
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,849
(Jared laughs)

183
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:03,801
- It's actually Bruce Lee approved dining.

184
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,161
- [Jared] I think Bruce
Lee would eat here;

185
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:07,938
Elle's eating here so I
think Bruce Lee would too.

187
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:25,660
Hey I know you guys!

188
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,178
- This is Chinese Red Bull.

189
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:30,542
This is a more vitamin functional drink.

190
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:33,514
Jared is going to try the vitamin drink.

191
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,681
- So this is American Red
Bull, this is the Chinese one.

192
00:08:38,744 --> 00:08:39,577
- [Elle] Taste it.

193
00:08:39,577 --> 00:08:40,409
- It smells about the same.

194
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,659
- [Jace] Close.

195
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:45,710
- That's not bad at all.

196
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,543
- [Jace] No.

197
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:47,376
- That's great!

198
00:08:47,376 --> 00:08:48,209
- [Jace] It's really soft.

199
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:50,248
- Mm Hm. There's no carbonation.

200
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,280
- [Jace] No. Super smooth.

201
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,113
- That's wow! I was
expecting like when you're

202
00:08:53,113 --> 00:08:55,497
like you've gotta try this
and it's gonna be nasty.

203
00:08:55,497 --> 00:08:57,497
- No no no it's so good.

204
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,150
- I like it.

205
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,966
- I just played chicken and won!

207
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,563
- Just hang on to me. Take
the weight off your feet.

208
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:50,730
I've gotcha. (laughs)

209
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,203
Whoa!

210
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,722
- We brought the 360
cam do you have it now?

211
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:01,970
- I was gonna say this is where the 360

212
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,501
cam would be really great.

214
00:10:14,216 --> 00:10:16,488
- So we were at this day spa.

215
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:18,914
We went to a day spa after all of that.

216
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:23,117
Walking around, it was a
blast but I got beat up.

217
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:26,480
Like I really got beat up by
this lady during the message.

218
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,235
It was so painful. How was yours?

219
00:10:28,235 --> 00:10:30,014
- They are fierce.

220
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:32,188
- Oh yeah! There thumbs are sharp.

221
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,065
- It was good though, it was
a good deep tissue massage.

222
00:10:35,065 --> 00:10:36,487
Got to sit in a hot tub.

223
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:37,552
- That was really nice.

224
00:10:37,552 --> 00:10:38,385
- It was fun.

225
00:10:38,385 --> 00:10:42,554
- Yeah, it was gorgeous in
there and then we're coming

226
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:44,785
outside and it's dark outside
now and all the buildings

227
00:10:44,785 --> 00:10:46,918
are lit up and everything.
That's pretty cool.

228
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:48,967
But we are jet lagged;

229
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:50,794
I'm tired and we're gonna go to sleep.

230
00:10:50,794 --> 00:10:52,037
- I feel much better
than I thought I would.

231
00:10:52,037 --> 00:10:55,360
I don't know how you're
supposed to feel with jet lag.

232
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,582
- When I went to Finland I was a

233
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:59,090
lot more jet lagged then, than I am now.

234
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,037
- Oh, they're walking down this way.

235
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:03,181
- We're getting in the taxi.

236
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:05,131
- Haven't been nauseous, haven't been just

237
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,795
haven't had a headache.

238
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:09,032
Just been tired is all. Yeah?

239
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:11,320
- Yeah, not bad at all.

240
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,331
- So far maybe it will
hit us day three or four

241
00:11:13,331 --> 00:00:00,000
or something you know?
