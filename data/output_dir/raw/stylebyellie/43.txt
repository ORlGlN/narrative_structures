1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,277
- It's time to have
fun, and practice hard!

2
00:00:02,277 --> 00:00:04,541
- [Jared] It's a tree house museum.

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:05,726
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness.

4
00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:08,523
Look at the beautiful mountains of Utah.

5
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:11,008
- This is a historic space launch.

6
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,031
- Felt very uncomfortable,
- Yeah.

7
00:00:13,031 --> 00:00:14,708
- especially around certain people

8
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:15,918
- [Jared] We've got one camera,

9
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:18,839
two camera, three camera, lights!

10
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:20,299
- And this time we actually
- Action.

11
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,980
- have Jared to make sure
the footage goes smoothly,

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,656
because I am a crappy camera person.

13
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:26,589
- I wouldn't say that.
I forget all the time.

14
00:00:26,589 --> 00:00:28,914
Bonnie and Ellie were
here a couple days ago,

15
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:31,009
filming this amazing make-up video,

16
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:32,249
and the mic was off.

17
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:33,983
- And it was blurry.
- Blah!

18
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:35,881
- And it was half my, it was my fault.

19
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,686
- So, lets show you what we got here.

20
00:00:38,686 --> 00:00:40,109
We've got our first half.

21
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:40,942
Look at that.

22
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:41,775
Isn't that great?

23
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:42,671
Look at the depth of field.

24
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:45,594
Look at the volume of the background.

25
00:00:45,594 --> 00:00:48,376
(laughing)

26
00:00:48,376 --> 00:00:50,777
Okay, and then we got this camera, okay.

27
00:00:50,777 --> 00:00:51,634
We're working guys.

28
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,949
We're working on Tuesday morning.

29
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:56,725
- It's like your legs shaking
when you're doing piano.

30
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:00,222
(electronic piano music)

31
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:01,583
- Okay, my favorite part.

32
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,786
- I love when you do videos like this,

33
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:06,573
because you laugh so much, and I just love

34
00:01:06,573 --> 00:01:07,902
seeing you laugh
- Thank you.

35
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,200
- more than anything in the world.

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,391
- Thank you.
- When's that gonna be

37
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:11,675
up on your channel?

38
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:12,602
- Should be up on Tuesday.

39
00:01:12,602 --> 00:01:13,732
- Tuesday? Kay.

40
00:01:13,732 --> 00:01:14,565
- Yes.

41
00:01:14,565 --> 00:01:15,398
- It's gonna be fun.

42
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:16,933
Look for it on Ellie's channel on Tuesday,

43
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:17,796
we'll have 'em link 'em.

44
00:01:17,796 --> 00:01:18,629
- Shut up and kiss me!

45
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:19,462
- Oh!

46
00:01:19,462 --> 00:01:20,295
Oh baby!

47
00:01:20,295 --> 00:01:22,569
You just put that lipstick
on and it is fresh,

48
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:23,871
and do you see it on my lips?

49
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:27,297
No you don't because
American Woman by NARS.

50
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:29,214
I know because I got some for Ellie.

51
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,891
Hey buckaroo how was school today?

52
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,724
- Good.

53
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,014
- [Jared] Good, did you learn anything?

54
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:33,847
- Yep.

55
00:01:33,847 --> 00:01:34,805
- [Jared] What'd you learn?

56
00:01:34,805 --> 00:01:35,638
- More letters.

57
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:37,211
- [Jared] Oh, you learned
your letters more?

58
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:38,044
- Mmhm.

59
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,182
- Good, did you get a gem today?

60
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,223
What? One gem?

61
00:01:41,223 --> 00:01:44,015
Yay! You got a gem!

62
00:01:44,015 --> 00:01:44,950
Why do you get a gem?

63
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,783
- Because.

64
00:01:45,783 --> 00:01:48,415
- Do you get gems when you do nice things?

65
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,327
Awe. Great job buddy.

66
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:51,327
I'm proud of you.

67
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:53,849
Ellie and I have a couple
meetings out of town today,

68
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,161
so we are running around.

69
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:56,780
Grabbing a couple things before we go.

70
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,055
Ellie's actually already down there.

71
00:01:58,055 --> 00:01:58,951
Her and Bonnie went earlier.

72
00:01:58,951 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm trying to vlog

73
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,396
and think of what I need
to get at the same time,

74
00:02:01,396 --> 00:02:02,229
and it's not working.

75
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:03,374
I need to grab a couple things,

76
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,628
but while Ellie's in one of the meetings,

77
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:06,894
I'm going to take the kids,

78
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,834
and we're gonna try and
find something fun to do

79
00:02:08,834 --> 00:02:11,674
while we wait for one meeting to finish,

80
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,637
and then another meeting to start.

81
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:17,906
We are going to go to,
hopefully somewhere fun.

82
00:02:17,906 --> 00:02:20,331
We're gonna try and find
something fun to do. Kay?

83
00:02:20,331 --> 00:02:21,735
Are you okay with doin' something fun?

84
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:22,932
- What are we gonna go?

85
00:02:22,932 --> 00:02:24,218
- I dunno, we've gotta find it.

86
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:26,943
And then we're gonna
go see grandma Griffis.

87
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:29,133
Yeah buddy! Kay.

88
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,133
(children laughing)

89
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:31,423
You guys are so silly!

90
00:02:31,423 --> 00:02:33,084
(children laughing)

91
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,625
You're so silly! Huh?

92
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:35,892
You're so silly!

93
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:37,460
We've got an hour drive ahead of us,

94
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,218
so I have pulled up auditable,

95
00:02:39,218 --> 00:02:40,859
and we are listening to a book called,

96
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,571
The Power of Starting Something Stupid,

97
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,505
by my buddy Richie Norton,

98
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:47,528
and we're listenin' to
that, havin' a good time,

99
00:02:47,528 --> 00:02:50,087
admiring the beauty and
all of the melting snow

100
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,847
'cause it is 38 degrees
where we are right now.

101
00:02:52,847 --> 00:02:54,821
38, that means it's not freezing.

102
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:56,316
That means the snow is melting.

103
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:58,364
Can you believe it? It's happening!

104
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:01,864
(soft instrumental music)

105
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:11,628
- [Jared] We've made it.

106
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,359
Guys, the tree house museum.

107
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:15,690
Up this way? Okay.

108
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,851
They have games up here?

109
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:17,699
- [Children] Yeah!

110
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:18,532
- You'll have to show me.

111
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,572
We're at the tree house museum.

112
00:03:19,572 --> 00:03:20,535
I've never been here before,

113
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:21,648
but I know Ellie has taken the kids,

114
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,785
and they just love it.

115
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,995
Oh, you bonked your head?

116
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:24,849
Do you want me to kiss it?

117
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:26,385
(smooch)

118
00:03:26,385 --> 00:03:28,823
You better? Okay, let's play.

119
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:30,780
A kiss from dad works wonders.

120
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,613
- Hold my hand.

121
00:03:31,613 --> 00:03:32,800
- [Jared] I'll hold your hand, okay.

122
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,004
Where are we goin'?

123
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:35,337
- We have to go.

124
00:03:37,797 --> 00:03:40,880
Super wizard, muscle!

125
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:44,635
- [Child] Let's play this with you!

126
00:03:45,576 --> 00:03:49,076
(soft instrumental music)

127
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:52,348
- [Jared] Do you wanna see something cool?

128
00:03:52,348 --> 00:03:53,681
Kay, watch this.

129
00:03:56,315 --> 00:03:57,148
Can you try it?

130
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:57,981
- Yeah.

131
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,382
- Right on your finger,
oh that works, too!

132
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:02,436
(laughing)

133
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:03,353
Kay, ready?

134
00:04:04,808 --> 00:04:06,304
Hey!

135
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,137
Awe!

136
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,202
Yeah! High five.

137
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:12,358
While we are playing,
I'm using technology.

138
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:14,678
I am in the future is what it feels like.

139
00:04:14,678 --> 00:04:19,464
I'm watching Elon Musk launch
SpaceX Falcon Heavy launch.

140
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:22,571
He's got a Tesla Roadster two in there,

141
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,000
that he's gonna launch.

142
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,570
Jackson, look. You see this?

143
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,521
- Yeah.

144
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:29,417
- [Jared] We are going to
watch a rocket launch today.

145
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,250
Do you see the rocket?

146
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,327
- Yeah.

147
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:32,351
- [Jared] Is that so cool?

148
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,118
It's gonna launch in like two minutes,

149
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:35,530
and we're gonna watch
it take off into space.

150
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,566
Can you believe that?

151
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,544
Do you wanna watch it?

152
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,624
- I wanna watch it on your phone.

153
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:41,536
- [Jared] Okay, let's go
sit down and watch it.

154
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:42,893
Let's go get Calvin and we'll watch it.

155
00:04:42,893 --> 00:04:45,263
Calvin we're gonna watch
it launch right over there.

156
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:46,517
Kay? Do you wanna watch?

157
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:47,350
- No

158
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,402
- [Jared] No? Okay.

159
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:50,084
Do you wanna know what's
cool about this, Jackson?

160
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:50,917
- Mmhmm.

161
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,588
- Is we are witnessing history right now.

162
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:53,995
This is history in the making,

163
00:04:53,995 --> 00:04:55,574
and we're watching it together.

164
00:04:55,574 --> 00:04:58,578
This is a historic space
launch, rocket launch

165
00:04:58,578 --> 00:04:59,880

166
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,747
- Yeah. Looks really cool. Kay here we go!

167
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:04,380
Nine, eight,

Look it's goin'!

172
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:16,258
(laughing)

173
00:05:16,258 --> 00:05:18,043
We're watching a rocket launch.

174
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:20,280
Falcon Heavy just took off to the sky.

175
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,458
That rocket is gonna launch
a car into outer space,

176
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,667
and it's gonna orbit
Mars for a billion years,

177
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,647
or a million years, or
somethin' like that.

178
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:29,609
There it goes.

179
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:32,119
It's going 2,000 kilometers per hour,

180
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:34,283
and it's 20 kilometers in the sky.

181
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,507
- Where's the rocket?

182
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:36,956
- [Jared] It's right there,
it's that white thing.

183
00:05:36,956 --> 00:05:38,613
- The rocket's on fire.

184
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:39,839
- That's the boosters.

185
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,827
It's powering it through the sky.

186
00:05:41,827 --> 00:05:44,032
They had a successful
separation. Oh my god.

187
00:05:44,032 --> 00:05:46,691
The coolest thing about this
rocket is that it lands,

188
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,688
like it lands on a buoy out on a ocean.

189
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:53,356
And they just had successful
separation. Oh my gosh.

190
00:05:53,356 --> 00:05:55,942
10,000 kilometers per hour.

191
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:57,314
This is the deploy.

192
00:05:57,314 --> 00:05:59,795
Look at it, that's the car
they launched into space.

193
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:02,024
That's the Roadster. Don't Panic.

194
00:06:02,024 --> 00:06:05,195
It's playing Space Oddity by David Bowie.

195
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:08,097
Boosters have landed. Oh my gosh.

196
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,539
Hey bud, you climbin' all the way up?

197
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:12,520
There you are Jackson! Kay,
hook somethin' on there.

198
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,925
(laughing)

199
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:15,337
You got it? Is it hooked on?

200
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,154
Oh no! It's a parachute.

201
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,371
Oh that's okay.

202
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:19,686
Alright, I'm gonna send her back up.

203
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:23,457
Here she comes. Kay, grab
it and then throw it down.

204
00:06:23,457 --> 00:06:25,293
Okay, do it, do it, do it.

205
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,407
Whoa! I missed it again.

206
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:29,065
Give me some motorcycle sounds.

207
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:31,232
(rumbles)

208
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,873
(screeches)

209
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,306
Oh no! Turbulence.

210
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:36,630
(laughing)

211
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,871
Look at these heroes savin' the day. Yeah!

212
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,143
Do you guys wanna be firemen?

213
00:06:41,143 --> 00:06:41,984
- Yes.

214
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:42,817
- Yeah!

215
00:06:42,817 --> 00:06:45,573
Excuse me sir, could I buy
10 pounds of chocolate?

216
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:46,599
Yes, okay!

217
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,682
I didn't think it'd work!

218
00:06:50,632 --> 00:06:51,787
Oh yes, put the money in,

219
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,922
and then I'll take all of the candy.

220
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:55,754
Candy? You have candy?

221
00:06:55,754 --> 00:06:57,228
Okay, I'll take some.

222
00:06:57,228 --> 00:06:58,446
Can I have some change?

223
00:06:58,446 --> 00:06:59,279
- Uhuh.

224
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:00,112
- [Jared] Thank you.

225
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:02,801
Oh my gosh, did you find a baby?

226
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:03,956
- Yes ah.

227
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,974
- [Jared] Oh yeah, are
you gonna feed the baby?

228
00:07:05,974 --> 00:07:07,022
- No, dis wa.

229
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:09,198
- Oh, can you give the baby a kiss?

230
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:11,939
He found the baby a brother mount.

231
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,939
Are you ready to be a big brother?

232
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,810
What a good kid.

233
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,419
- I gotta baby!

234
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:19,148
- [Jared] You got a
baby? Kay, bring 'em out.

235
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,140
- It's a sad baby.

236
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,427
- [Jared] It's a sad baby?
Maybe we can make him happy.

237
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:24,717
Oh, he does look kinda sad.

238
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:27,808
He looks kinda like a 60 year
old in a baby's body, huh?

239
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:28,986
(laughing)

240
00:07:28,986 --> 00:07:30,916
Awe, that's such a good big brother, huh?

241
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:33,679
You guys are so good, and so loving.

242
00:07:33,679 --> 00:07:36,375
I know our little baby
brother is going to love

243
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,059
being with you boys, huh?

244
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,091
- Mmhmm.

245
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:39,993
- Mmhmm.

246
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,749
I kinda feel like this doctor behind me

247
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:43,910
is secretly judging me
and my life decisions.

248
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,103
Hey, I'm a good guy.

249
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:46,353
Is that your baby?

250
00:07:46,353 --> 00:07:47,626
- No, it's sad baby.

251
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:48,737
- [Jared] Oh, it's a sad baby?

252
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:49,570
- Ahaa.

253
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,669
- [Jared] How can you make 'em happy?

254
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:51,970
Oh, let's put him back.

255
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,678
Oh, so gentle. Good job.

256
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:54,946
- [Jackson] This is not a baby!

257
00:07:54,946 --> 00:07:56,209
- [Jared] Is that Muppet?

258
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,476
- A puppet!

259
00:07:57,476 --> 00:07:58,309
- A puppet?

260
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:00,625
When we have our baby brother,
are we gonna do things like,

261
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,059
♪ Hush little baby don't say a word ♪

♪ And it's made from electricity ♪

265
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,832
Oh we've had twins!

266
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:17,415
We had twins!

267
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:21,312
♪ Hush little babies don't say a word ♪

268
00:08:21,312 --> 00:08:25,847
♪ Daddy's gonna get you a something bird ♪

269
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:28,113
Good job Jackson, you're doin' so great.

270
00:08:28,113 --> 00:08:29,279
Calvin, can you try?

271
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,956
Can you rock the baby to sleep? Good job.

272
00:08:32,956 --> 00:08:35,041
(vrooms)

273
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,746
How bad does your head hurt right now?

274
00:08:36,746 --> 00:08:38,354
(laughing)

275
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:39,220
- Um.

276
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,604
(laughing)

277
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,734
- Both of you, I'm
asking both of you guys.

278
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:45,154
If I knew how, to like,
pop your necks like Landon

279
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:46,088
I would do that right now.

280
00:08:46,088 --> 00:08:47,057
- That's okay.

281
00:08:47,057 --> 00:08:51,564
Um, our, the cook, the family
cookbook is going to be

282
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,485
a piece that is gonna go from--

283
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:54,473
- It's gonna be artwork.

284
00:08:54,473 --> 00:08:55,770
- Generation to generation.

285
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,801
We just spent over hundreds
and hundreds of pictures.

286
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,132
- And we have hundreds and hundreds more.

287
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:02,475
- I don't have any words I wanna say,

288
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:05,091
just that it was really
a good morning to work,

289
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:08,492
but also, like, I can't wait for like our

290
00:09:08,492 --> 00:09:09,816
kids and grandkids to have this book.

291
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,802
- Mmhmm. So Bonnie and
Ellie just had their

292
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,329
first meeting that I told you about,

293
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,928
and then we just finished up
our second meeting, non-stop.

294
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:17,140
- [Ellie] Without stopping.

295
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,171
- And without eating!

296
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:19,741
- And guess what? I don't want to say this

297
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:21,941
in front of Bonnie, but
you don't like me anyway.

298
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:23,022
I'm goin' to In and Out.

299
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:25,169
- You bet you, yes!

300
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,274
(smacking)

301
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,140
Get it girl! That's my girl!

302
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,396
- I'm gonna go home
and have another apple.

303
00:09:30,396 --> 00:09:31,318
(laughing)

304
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:33,551
- I'll just have this water. I'm full.

305
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:34,898
Name that movie.

306
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:36,663
Alright, enough of that business stuff,

307
00:09:36,663 --> 00:09:38,348
no one cares about business talk,

308
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:40,481
it's time to have fun and practice hard.

309
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:43,092
Jackson, you ready to
practice your baseball?

310
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:43,997
- Yep!

311
00:09:43,997 --> 00:09:44,874
- [Jared] Yep.

312
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:48,274
Calvin, you ready to practice
your swingin' superman?

313
00:09:48,274 --> 00:09:50,750
Here we go! Whoa!

314
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,943
Let's do this. Kay,
I'll throw you the ball,

315
00:09:52,943 --> 00:09:56,505
and the you swing and hit. Ready?

316
00:09:56,505 --> 00:09:58,672
Whoa! First hit! Good job!

317
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:02,937
- [Ellie] Whoa, good job!

318
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:03,955
(thudding)

319
00:10:03,955 --> 00:10:05,476
Whoa! I heard that.

320
00:10:05,476 --> 00:10:07,346
(laughing)

321
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:08,179
- [Jared] Good hit bud!

322
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:09,316
- [Ellie] You hit dad!

323
00:10:09,316 --> 00:10:10,149
- [Jared] One try!

324
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:12,187
(laughing)

325
00:10:12,187 --> 00:10:13,185
- [Ellie] Whoa!

326
00:10:13,185 --> 00:10:14,932
(laughing)

327
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:16,149
- Look at our boys.

328
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,328
- [Ellie] I just love when kids
are so excited to show you.

329
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:19,161
- Ready?

330
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:20,039
- [Ellie] Last one.

331
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,658
- [Jared] Here we go. Get in position.

332
00:10:22,658 --> 00:10:25,075
Bring it back. There you go.

333
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,599
- [Ellie] What!

334
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:29,486
- Did you see that?

335
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:31,564
- [Ellie] Good job dude, you kiss the bat.

336
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,586
(laughing)

337
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:34,204
He doesn't even know we're watching him.

338
00:10:34,204 --> 00:10:35,595
That's the funny part.

339
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,897
He's loving this. He's
looking for the key.

340
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,147
(laughing)

341
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,440
And he's out.

342
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,273
(laughing)

343
00:10:43,273 --> 00:10:44,143
Hi Cal.

344
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,544
- Grandpa's gonna be so exited.

345
00:10:46,544 --> 00:10:49,354
- Grandpa just got home?

346
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:50,862
Can you hear him?

347
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:55,687
I feel like I should be in
a Carl's Jr. Commercial.

348
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,234
- [Jared] Oh baby! Move
over Kim Kardashian.

349
00:10:58,234 --> 00:10:59,067
- Over.

350
00:10:59,067 --> 00:10:59,900
- [Jared] You've got the moves.

351
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,448
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness.

352
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:04,266
Look at the beautiful mountains of Utah.

353
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:06,315
- I've mentioned in tweets
and on the videos that

354
00:11:06,315 --> 00:11:09,593
my mind has just been going a lot lately,

355
00:11:09,593 --> 00:11:12,598
I've been motivated for things,
talking about old projects,

356
00:11:12,598 --> 00:11:16,176
new projects, and the book
that I've been listening to

357
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,089
really struck a chord with me today,

358
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:21,227
and a quote from Jim Carrey

359
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:24,454
has been striking a chord a chord with me.

360
00:11:24,454 --> 00:11:27,880
Jim Carrey said, "you can fail
at something that you hate,

361
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,942
so you might as well try
something that you love."

362
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:34,078
You know, and I've been
thinking about, like,

363
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:37,858
Elon Musk, today he launched a rocket

364
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:41,048
and landed two of them on a barge,

365
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:44,148
and he sent a Tesla into orbit,

366
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:45,979
and it going to be in Mars orbit.

367
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:50,666
When he started doing Tesla,
SpaceX, and all of that stuff,

368
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:54,645
even PayPal, back in the day,
people thought it was crazy,

369
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:56,286
people thought it was weird,

370
00:11:56,286 --> 00:11:58,868
people didn't think he was
going to be successful.

371
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,409
Same thing with Steve Jobs,

372
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,086
same thing with Jeff Bezos with Amazon.

373
00:12:03,086 --> 00:12:06,825
People thought these things
were weird, and different,

374
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:11,445
and a failure, and I can't
help but think of the whole,

375
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,536
like, vlogging movement.

376
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:16,722
When we started vlogging,
people thought it was different,

377
00:12:16,722 --> 00:12:19,056
people thought, even family thought,

378
00:12:19,056 --> 00:12:20,933
you're a little weird for doin' that.

379
00:12:20,933 --> 00:12:23,579
- It was weird. We felt
very uncomfortable,

380
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,372
especially around certain people,

381
00:12:25,372 --> 00:12:26,724
but that's okay.

382
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:30,373
- Yeah, and I could not be
more proud about where we are,

383
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:31,703
and what we're doing.

384
00:12:31,703 --> 00:12:33,743
- And now it's very normal, like you,

385
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:36,373
I mean it's not like everyone's vlogging,

386
00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:39,403
but just social media,
and like, Instagram,

387
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:43,678
Instagram stories, Facebook,
just like, not just vlogging,

388
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,327
but like, the way the news is.

389
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:51,273
They vlog style the news a
lot and it's just common.

390
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:56,273
- Yeah. It was weird, but
now it's becoming normal.

391
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,830
We're at that point in time

392
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,585
where things like this have shifted.

393
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:06,585
Now people are seeking after
Elon Musk, praising Elon Musk.

394
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:07,964
I mean look at Apple,

395
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:11,238
the most valuable company
in the world, Amazon, Jeff--

396
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:13,505
- Except hate that they
don't have a home button.

397
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:14,338
- Right.

398
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,304
- That's why I'm not gonna switch.

399
00:13:15,304 --> 00:13:16,137
- To the ten?

400
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:19,606
Jeff Bezos is the
richest man in the world,

401
00:13:19,606 --> 00:13:21,988
I think is what the most recent thing is,

402
00:13:21,988 --> 00:13:25,355
and vlogging, social media is so normal,

403
00:13:25,355 --> 00:13:28,119
and I just can't help but
think about the new projects

404
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:31,849
that we have going on, the
things that we're thinking of,

405
00:13:31,849 --> 00:13:33,169
the things that we're planning.

406
00:13:33,169 --> 00:13:34,572
People might think it's different.

407
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:35,405
- Yeah.

408
00:13:35,405 --> 00:13:36,728
- People might think it's weird,

409
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:39,707
but that just makes everything
a little bit more exiting.

410
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:41,503
- And if it's special
to you, it is special,

411
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,346
like the cookbook, it's
like pictures of our food,

412
00:13:44,346 --> 00:13:46,111
but to us that's very special.

413
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,439
- It is very special,

414
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:50,899
and I just wanted to say this, like,

415
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:54,923
with what you're doing people
might think it's weird,

416
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:56,533
but you keep doing it,

417
00:13:56,533 --> 00:13:59,086
because there may come a time in your life

418
00:13:59,086 --> 00:14:02,844
where people will be wishing
that they were with you

419
00:14:02,844 --> 00:14:04,095
when it was happening.

420
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,664
I think Will Smith said like,

421
00:14:05,664 --> 00:14:07,513
"if you're absent during my struggle,

422
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,894
don't be expect to be
present during my triumph".

423
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:10,727
- Amen.

424
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:11,560
- You know?

425
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,331
So, there's lots of things
happening in the world.

426
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:16,296
Lots of changes are going on,

427
00:14:16,296 --> 00:14:19,303
and we're gonna seek after those things,

428
00:14:19,303 --> 00:14:21,428
and we're gonna accomplish our plans,

429
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:23,549
and I'm exited, and if they fail,

430
00:14:23,549 --> 00:14:26,035
that's just a stepping
stone into something new

431
00:14:26,035 --> 00:14:28,875
- And that's like anything,
like my hand lettering,

432
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:29,864
I've been loving doing that,

433
00:14:29,864 --> 00:14:31,682
like this is not like
some huge, elaborate,

434
00:14:31,682 --> 00:14:33,596
like this is even just simple stuff

435
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:35,277
that may be simple to some people,

436
00:14:35,277 --> 00:14:38,416
but it's really hard for me,
and I'm gonna do good at it.

437
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,068
- Yeah, absolutely.
- And I'm proud of myself

438
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:41,389
today when we were doing notes,

439
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,969
everyone had computers, but
I was in charge of the notes,

440
00:14:43,969 --> 00:14:47,455
and I'm proud of myself.
My handwriting looked good.

441
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:50,102
- Good, and that's the
thing, just baby steps,

442
00:14:50,102 --> 00:14:51,576
work one step at a time.

443
00:14:51,576 --> 00:14:54,101
I'm feeling motivated, and
that's just what I want is to

444
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,668
leave it with you today.
- That's sweet.

445
00:14:55,668 --> 00:14:56,501
- So--

446
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:57,334
- I love that.

447
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:58,360
- Thanks for watching guys.

448
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,971
I hope you're feeling
it just as much as I am,

449
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:03,405
because big things are commin',

450
00:15:03,405 --> 00:15:04,875
and we gotta pack.

451
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:08,101
- Yes, tomorrow we get
to look at baby products!

452
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:08,934
- Whoo!

453
00:15:08,934 --> 00:15:11,065
So, until then, we'll
see you guys next time.

454
00:15:11,065 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye
- Bye
