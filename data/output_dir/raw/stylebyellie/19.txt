1
00:00:00,419 --> 00:00:03,109
(cheering)

2
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:03,942
- I said, sir!

3
00:00:03,942 --> 00:00:04,775
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,775 --> 00:00:06,923
- Hi! What were you doing back there?

5
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,800
- You may sound a little boring,
but you're not like Arie.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,594
Mister, Mister Clark. You
love to get yourself dressed.

7
00:00:14,594 --> 00:00:15,627
- Yeah.

8
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:18,179
- And you know what, I think
he does pretty dang good job

9
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:19,475
getting himself dressed.

10
00:00:19,475 --> 00:00:23,087
This morning he's like,
"I want you to feed me."

11
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:25,715
And I thought for a second,
I'm like I haven't fed you

12
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:28,572
in forever, so sure I'll feed you.

13
00:00:28,572 --> 00:00:31,176
My little Jackson that's getting so big.

14
00:00:31,176 --> 00:00:33,100
Are you gonna have fun at school?

15
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,044
What do you think you'll
do at school today?

16
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:36,177
- I don't know.

17
00:00:36,177 --> 00:00:39,206
- Maybe paint? What's your
favorite thing to do at school?

18
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,211
- Play with toys.

19
00:00:40,211 --> 00:00:41,430
- Play with toys. Yeah.

20
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,761
- And my friends are Ryker and Tiger.

21
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,880
- Oh, cool!

22
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,211
You think Ryker and Tiger are twins?

23
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:50,044
- Yeah.

24
00:00:50,044 --> 00:00:50,965
- Is he name Tiger?

25
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:52,279
- Tiger and Ryker.

26
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:54,184
- Oh. That's cool.

27
00:00:54,184 --> 00:00:56,001
- Alright are you guys ready to do this?

28
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:57,011
- Yeah!

29
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:57,844
- We're ready!

30
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:58,677
- Let's go!

31
00:00:58,677 --> 00:01:00,268
Can we take your truck? Is that okay?

32
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,179
- Si, senior.

33
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:02,012
(laughing)

34
00:01:02,012 --> 00:01:02,845
- Oh, yes! High five.

35
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:06,038
- It has been many many months
since we have had to do that.

36
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:07,513
Thank you for pulling over.

37
00:01:07,513 --> 00:01:10,436
My stomach is, I feel like
I'm starting to get Braxton

38
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,348
contractions. I had one the other day,

39
00:01:12,348 --> 00:01:15,302
and I literally was like, I just sat down.

40
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:16,573
It was the weirdest thing.

41
00:01:16,573 --> 00:01:17,406
- Oh my gosh.

42
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:19,335
- And I had to breathe, like
my stomach was so tight.

43
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:20,368
Maybe that's it?

44
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:23,436
Cause my stomach is
like so tight right now.

45
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:25,630
But I feel sick as a dog.

46
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,921
So we stopped and I
got a drink, Cheez-Its,

47
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,356
beef sticks and a banana.

48
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:34,140
I feel so, just like, sick.
So thanks for pulling over.

49
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,061
Bonnie's like, Ellie are you okay?

50
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,169
- Yeah, I'm like

51
00:01:37,169 --> 00:01:38,658
(laughing)

52
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:40,467
- Am I filming you or window?

53
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,492
- The window.

54
00:01:41,492 --> 00:01:44,002
I was like we have to pull
over and get you something

55
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:47,578
if you are sick, because we
have a time we're supposed to

56
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:50,020
be there at a certain time,
but they can wait a minute

57
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,435
so that you're not sick.

58
00:01:51,435 --> 00:01:52,268
- Thank you!

59
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:53,339
- You're welcome.

60
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:55,447
- We have hundreds of orders,
and we want to be here

61
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:59,725
to fill them and sign them
and ship them on their way.

62
00:01:59,725 --> 00:02:02,346
- We came down to the warehouse
where all of our products.

63
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,279
- [Ellie] Yay!

64
00:02:03,279 --> 00:02:05,931
- It's like look at this,
look, look at this dress,

65
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,003
look at the stitching.

66
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,044
- [Ellie] Our BOLLIE logo.

67
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:10,435
- Isn't this absolutely
incredible and beautiful?

68
00:02:10,435 --> 00:02:11,718
- [Ellie] I love it!

69
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:13,186
- [Bonnie] In the masses.

70
00:02:13,186 --> 00:02:15,654
- [Ellie] Yes. We have our robes.

71
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:18,139
We are getting ready to ship stuff out.

72
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:21,157
- Oh my gosh, like this is such
a surreal feeling right now.

73
00:02:21,157 --> 00:02:23,898
So, if you guys made the
first, if you're one of the few

74
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,190
hundreds of people who made
orders, you'll probably get,

75
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,466
like a little signature
from us, like how exciting.

76
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:30,659
If you do get one, let us know!

77
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:35,441
We've got pop sockets,
leggings, dresses, robes, bras.

78
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,315
Isn't this cool?

79
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:39,728
- [Ellie] I cannot believe it.

80
00:02:39,728 --> 00:02:41,401
- That blows my mind.

81
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:43,167
- I can't wait to do this!

82
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:45,933
- K! Enough yappin', let's
get to work and start packin'.

83
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:47,494
(gasp)

84
00:02:47,494 --> 00:02:48,327
- Oh!

85
00:02:48,327 --> 00:02:49,160
- Oh!

86
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,421
(laughing)

87
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:52,697
- Yasmine, we got your order comin'.

88
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:53,556
Yes!

89
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:55,483
Do we have more pens? Here, hand me a pen.

90
00:02:55,483 --> 00:02:56,452
Packed by Jared!

91
00:02:56,452 --> 00:02:57,718
(laughing)

92
00:02:57,718 --> 00:02:59,024
Woo! Here we go.

93
00:02:59,024 --> 00:03:02,291
- K, Veronica, you're package
is packed and ready to go,

94
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,960
and I even double checked
everything, so I didn't screw up.

95
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,488
- Lacy, hey!

96
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:08,817
- Pregnant Ellie here.

97
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:09,727
I'm just telling Jared what to do.

98
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:11,060
Jared, envelope.

99
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:15,936
Jared, small robe.

100
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:19,969
Perfect.

101
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,409
- Jordan, I hope this robe
gives you as much love

102
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,294
as I'm giving it now.

103
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:24,147
(laughing)

104
00:03:24,147 --> 00:03:24,980
Enjoy.

105
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,230
- Jared, stuff.

106
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,382
Jared, slip.

107
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:30,806
Jared, seal.

108
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:33,739
(package crinkling)

109
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:35,753
Slap that label.

110
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,527
I'm so good at packaging.

111
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:40,110
(upbeat music)

112
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,954
Guess who's order I just picked up!

113
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:45,787
- [All Three] Who's?

114
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:46,620
- Guess!

115
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,453
- Mom's?

116
00:03:47,453 --> 00:03:48,286
- Julie's?

117
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:49,119
- Jennifer Griffith!

118
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:49,952
(cheering)

119
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:51,161
- Woo! Mom!

120
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,411
Thanks mom.

121
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:53,828
- Hashtag BOLLIE.

122
00:03:55,427 --> 00:03:57,366
- Let's hand deliver mom's package to her.

123
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,199
- Yes!

124
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,127
(cheering)

125
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:00,577
- Okay, I'll go get the stuff.

126
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:02,127
- You're a good son-in-law.

127
00:04:02,127 --> 00:04:03,327
- Maybe she'll have lunch for us.

128
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:04,942
(laughing)

129
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:07,820
- Alight, mom's all
packaged and ready to go.

130
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:08,653
- So cute.

131
00:04:08,653 --> 00:04:09,486
- Aw!

132
00:04:09,486 --> 00:04:10,578
- Isn't this fun?

133
00:04:10,578 --> 00:04:11,411
- She's gonna die.

134
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,627
- (signing) Hand, sealed, delivered,

135
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,484
- [Together] I'm yours.

136
00:04:13,484 --> 00:04:17,531
- I swear the times I laugh
the hardest is just moments

137
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:20,910
like this where we are
walking, just to the car.

138
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,743
(laughing)

139
00:04:21,743 --> 00:04:24,618
Like the time that Bonnie was
like, "Oh, excuse me, sir."

140
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:27,081
And he didn't say anything
cause we walked by him

141
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,616
and it was like years ago.

142
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:29,949
- I said, "Sir!"

143
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:33,958
- And he didn't turn around
and she was like, "Sir!"

144
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:37,000
like pretended to kick
him, we just, we died!

145
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,485
Like the funniest things
I ever laughed about

146
00:04:39,485 --> 00:04:41,092
is just when we're walking to the car.

147
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:42,846
Well that was a wrap up of the warehouse.

148
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,588
We had to so much fun.

149
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:47,304
But we have one deliver
that we need to make.

150
00:04:47,304 --> 00:04:48,137
Mom's.

151
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:49,952
- Hand delivery.

152
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:53,700
- [Mom] No way! I just barely saw this.

153
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,257
- [Jared] Special delivery!

154
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,964
- Oh my gosh! No way!

155
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,625
- [Ellie] Mom, what are you working on?

156
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:00,162
- Well, I've been working hard.

157
00:05:00,162 --> 00:05:02,148
- [Ellie] You have your office all set up.

158
00:05:02,148 --> 00:05:04,383
- This is my office, I'm
gonna need a new chair.

159
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,275
(laughing)

160
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:07,594
- [Ellie] Here, give momma her packages.

161
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:09,950
- What would you like to open first?

162
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,013
- Oh, the robe.

163
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:11,846
- [Jared] Ahh.

164
00:05:11,846 --> 00:05:12,679
- [Bonnie] Yay!

165
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:15,007
- Oh! What's this? Oh this is the um,

166
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:16,190
- [Bonnie & Jared] Phone case.

167
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,913
- [Bonnie] Now, what size
of phone do you have?

168
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,018
- I have a great, big phone.

169
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:19,851
(laughing)

170
00:05:19,851 --> 00:05:21,960
- So she ordered the wrong
phone case for her phone.

171
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,884
- [Jared] She ordered
the wrong phone case.

172
00:05:22,884 --> 00:05:23,717
(Ellie laughing)

173
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:25,934
- And we were there, we were
going to bring you right one.

174
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:26,767
- [Mom] That's okay.

175
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:28,278
- Oh my gosh, we'll take it back for you.

176
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:31,088
- [Other Man] That's not
a BOLLIE shipping problem.

177
00:05:31,088 --> 00:05:32,476
- Why am I so nervous? I'm like, oh!

178
00:05:32,476 --> 00:05:33,978
- Because you're on camera.
There's a little thing there.

179
00:05:33,978 --> 00:05:35,297
It's okay.

180
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:36,370
- Okay, okay.

181
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,239
- Now wait a minute.
Did you only order one?

182
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,331
- I ordered one for,

183
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,854
- [Jared] And you sent it someone else.

184
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:42,489
- Yes, I sent it to someone,

185
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:43,873
- Okay I was like did we mess that up?

186
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:44,794
Okay.

187
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,142
- I ordered on for my sister!

188
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:47,669
- [Ellie] Oh you're so cute.

189
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:50,762
- Yes, it's her birthday next
week, so I got her one too.

190
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:52,012
- [Bonnie] Yay!

191
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:57,247
- Oh this, this is so
cool. This is so cool.

192
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:58,478
- [Bonnie] It's so cute on you.

193
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:00,312
- [Ellie] You look beautiful!

194
00:06:00,312 --> 00:06:01,589
- [Mom] Oh this is cute!

195
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:03,278
I love the fabric.

196
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:04,294
I love it.

197
00:06:04,294 --> 00:06:06,698
- [Ellie] You look so cute.
Mom, thanks for supporting us!

198
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:10,155
- I have been waitin'. Like,
I knew these were comin'.

199
00:06:10,155 --> 00:06:13,157
So, I didn't buy a robe
since, like October.

200
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:14,633
- [Bonnie] Oh my gosh.

201
00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:15,881
- I wanted one for
Christmas and I'm like, no

202
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:17,298
I'm not gonna do it.

203
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:20,467
- [Bonnie] It's so cute on you. I love it.

204
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:21,611
- [Mom] I love it.

205
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:22,725
- [Ellie] Cute, mom.

206
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:23,786
- [Jared] Is it comfy?

207
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:28,577
- Yes! Got a place here for my
phone, and it won't fall out.

208
00:06:28,577 --> 00:06:32,492
I like that. I like the
length of the sleeves,

209
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,825
I like the feel, I like the stretch.

210
00:06:34,825 --> 00:06:36,145
- [Ellie] We are not making mom say this.

211
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:37,609
(laughing)

212
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:38,442
Cute!

213
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:43,280
(child yelling)

214
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:47,541
(laughing)

215
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,791
- [Grandma] Oh!

216
00:06:50,042 --> 00:06:51,308
- [Jared] Hi, what were
you doing back there?

217
00:06:51,308 --> 00:06:52,735
- [Grandma] We were playing hide-and-seek.

218
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:53,968
- [Jared] Oh, fun!

219
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:56,479
Hi, Cal. Hi, mom. Hi, Jack.

220
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:57,386
- [Jack] Hi.

221
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:58,570
- [Jared] Come give me hugs.

222
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,879
- [Ellie] Were you playing hide-and-seek?

223
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,813
- [Jared] Hey, Cal. Come give me hugs.

224
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:05,558
Oh, I missed you. Muah.

225
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,109
Were you shakin' and movin' and groovin'?

226
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:08,438
Show me your dance moves.

227
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:09,355
Yeah, boys!

228
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,676
Look at grandma, what
grandma's teachin' ya.

229
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:14,121
- [Grandma] Oh that's not from grandma.

230
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:16,165
(laughing)

231
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:17,081
- [Jared] Hey, dad.

232
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:18,128
- [Dad] Hey.

233
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,390
- Um, doing orders was so fun.

234
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,223
- [Jared] Yes it was.

235
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,056
- [Grandma] Was it? Oh, good.

236
00:07:21,056 --> 00:07:21,889
- Yes it was.

237
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:22,722
- [Jared] Yes it was so sweet.

238
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:23,555
- [Grandma] Oh good.

239
00:07:23,555 --> 00:07:26,066
- Give grandma a kisses goodbye, Cal.

240
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,280
- [Jared] Aww.

241
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,802
- [Grandma] Can you come watch
sharks? Watch it another day.

242
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:34,734
- [Jared] Calvin, blow grandma a kiss.

243
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,038
Aww. Can you blow her a kiss?

244
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:36,871
- [Ellie] Can you do this?

245
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:38,263
(laughing)

246
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:39,742
- [Jared] He just did it like five times.

247
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,124
Calvin like this. Like
this, like this, like this,

248
00:07:41,124 --> 00:07:42,042
like this.

249
00:07:42,042 --> 00:07:42,875
Yeah there you go.

250
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:43,946
- [Ellie] Can I see it?

251
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:45,613
- [Jared] Bye, guys.

252
00:07:47,364 --> 00:07:49,118
- [Ellie] When was the last time

253
00:07:49,118 --> 00:07:51,516
you gave your kid a piggy-back ride?

254
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:53,623
I was wiping up the
floor and Calvin came and

255
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,219
jumped on my back.

256
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:57,274
Did you like that, Cal?

257
00:07:57,274 --> 00:07:58,476
- [Calvin] I do again.

258
00:07:58,476 --> 00:07:59,386
- You want me to do it again?

259
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,219
Oh!

260
00:08:01,104 --> 00:08:04,577
I have not given my kids a
piggy-back ride in forever.

261
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:08,024
It's little things like that
and picking your kids up

262
00:08:08,024 --> 00:08:10,723
and holding them, like this
morning when Jackson's like,

263
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:12,309
"I want you to feed me",
I'm like, "that's crazy",

264
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:13,975
I was like, "but, okay!"

265
00:08:13,975 --> 00:08:17,266
Because he's my little
toddler, and I have not

266
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:19,804
fed him in forever, and I was like,

267
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:21,202
- [Calvin] (jabbering)

268
00:08:21,202 --> 00:08:22,927
- And it was such a cute
moment, just like putting

269
00:08:22,927 --> 00:08:23,913
him on the counter,

270
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:25,521
- [Calvin] This is my dog. Woof!

271
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,969
- Talking to him,

272
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,224
- [Calvin] I want you to do it again.

273
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:31,181
- I'm not doing it
again I'm out of breath.

274
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:33,765
My stomach, all day, I thought
it was just for a minute

275
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:36,417
it would hurt, but my stomach,

276
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,721
I have noticed a lot of changes today,

277
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,337
like I'm just out of breath, well,

278
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:42,506
obviously because I'm getting chocked,

279
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:44,481
but I'm just out of breath a lot,

280
00:08:44,481 --> 00:08:47,215
and just pregnancy and growing.

281
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:50,486
It's just crazy what
baby's doing in there.

282
00:08:50,486 --> 00:08:53,885
He's grown', and I can feel you.

283
00:08:53,885 --> 00:08:55,633
- [Calvin] (jabbering)

284
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:56,466
- What?

285
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:57,739
- [Calvin] I want to do it again.

286
00:08:57,739 --> 00:08:58,739
- Last time,

287
00:09:00,102 --> 00:09:01,551
last time.

288
00:09:01,551 --> 00:09:03,812
(heavy breathing and laughing)

289
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:06,126
- [Ellie] Alright, I
may have just found the

290
00:09:06,126 --> 00:09:08,947
best crepe recipe. I love crepes.

291
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:11,474
And tonight and I wanted
to do a simple dinner.

292
00:09:11,474 --> 00:09:15,583
I found this girl on
Pinterest, TheLittleBroken.com

293
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:16,442
is her name.

294
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,754
But, I've made crepes before
but this is my favorite.

295
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:21,261
It's two large eggs, a cup
of milk, half cup water,

296
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,210
one cup flour, two tablespoons butter,

297
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,414
one to two tablespoons honey, um,

298
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,447
a teaspoon vanilla and pinch of salt.

299
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:31,113
You mix it, refrigerate it.

300
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:34,118
And like they're the best
crepes I've ever made.

301
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:34,951
Super thin.

302
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:36,279
Jared's actually resting right now,

303
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:38,199
he woke up this morning
with a super bad cold,

304
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:39,934
so I'm saving those for Jared.

305
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,078
I'm going to eat mine, the
kids already ate theirs

306
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:45,188
and like ran off, so I'm
gonna sit by myself and

307
00:09:45,188 --> 00:09:47,306
enjoy some dinner.

308
00:09:47,306 --> 00:09:48,532
Oh, hi miss pretty girl.

309
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:50,077
Hi, miss pretty girl.

310
00:09:50,077 --> 00:09:51,146
How are you?

311
00:09:51,146 --> 00:09:53,239
You know what I was
thinking of the other night.

312
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,977
It's going to be so fun and the baby comes

313
00:09:56,977 --> 00:09:59,951
and we put the kids in
bed but it's just like me,

314
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:02,882
the baby, and Jared, but then
like Penny time, ya know?

315
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:06,401
Like I'm excited to see
how Penny is with the baby.

316
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,489
It's just going to be
exciting, there's going to be

317
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:11,282
a lot of changes that I'm
like looking forward to.

318
00:10:11,282 --> 00:10:13,913
You wanna know what Jackson
said in his prayer tonight?

319
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:14,813
- [Jared] What did he say?

320
00:10:14,813 --> 00:10:17,796
- He said, usually, it's like,
"no help me say the prayer",

321
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:19,966
no, he said it all on
his own, and he said,

322
00:10:19,966 --> 00:10:23,526
"please help us be nice to each other",

323
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,359
- [Jared] Aww

324
00:10:24,359 --> 00:10:26,834
- and then he said "and
let me see me cousins."

325
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,966
(laughing)

326
00:10:28,966 --> 00:10:29,799
Amen.

327
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,013
(laughing)

328
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,296
- [Jared] That's real sweet.

329
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:34,097
- It was so funny.

330
00:10:34,097 --> 00:10:36,088
That was his prayer, to see his cousins,

331
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:37,381
Huh, Pen.

332
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:38,214
He loves them

333
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,393
- Can the studio audience
please give Ellie

334
00:10:40,393 --> 00:10:42,888
a round of applause?

335
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:43,805
- Whaaaaat!

336
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:47,401
- Thank you very much
studio audience for that.

337
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:50,377
I don't know what has really
happened for the past couple

338
00:10:50,377 --> 00:10:54,754
hours, um, but I just know
that Ellie has taken care

339
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:58,842
of everything for the time
because I wasn't there,

340
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,340
I don't know where I was.

341
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:05,090
- You may sound a little boring
but you're not like Arie.

342
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,722
That was an interesting
ending to The Bachelor

343
00:11:08,722 --> 00:11:09,555
- Yes, it was.

344
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:10,388
- If anybody watched.

345
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:12,174
- It was very, like, boring.

346
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:15,054
- Yeah, I feel like I'm
kind of in the space

347
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:17,987
between dream and reality,
so I don't know what's real

348
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:19,706
and I don't know what's fake,

349
00:11:19,706 --> 00:11:24,706
but I think I watched The
Bachelor and they had a horse.

350
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:28,170
- That was like the last two seconds.

351
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,172
- So, here's the deal, I'm
gonna try to pull it together

352
00:11:30,172 --> 00:11:31,716
and get some work done
before the night ends

353
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,224
before I go back to bed,

354
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:35,099
but thank you guys so much for watching,

355
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:36,966
it was so much fun to go
to the warehouse today

356
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,567
and pack a bunch of those orders

357
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:40,111
and write you a bunch of notes.

358
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:42,654
Thank you so much for the
support, for everything.

359
00:11:42,654 --> 00:11:44,844
Ugh, crossing my fingers
this doesn't last long,

360
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:47,887
I don't normally get sick
but I think when I do,

361
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,249
it like okay, you're sick,

362
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,513
so hopefully I get better,

363
00:11:52,513 --> 00:11:54,121
hopefully I can put word together,

364
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm having a hard time right now guys,

365
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,324
and I know this is so
disastrous for you to watch

366
00:11:58,324 --> 00:11:59,786
so I'm going to end it here.

367
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:02,003
Thank you for watching and
we will see you next time.

368
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:02,836
Bye.

369
00:12:02,836 --> 00:00:00,000
(snoring)
