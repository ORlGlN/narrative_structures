1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,567
- [Jared] What are you
doing with that spoon?

2
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:02,680
- Unlock the door.

3
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,930
- The most humbling thing to see

4
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:07,819
is your own children
growing and developing.

5
00:00:07,819 --> 00:00:09,532
- [Grandma] Beautiful,
it's gonna be beautiful.

6
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:11,052
- Yay!

7
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:12,589
(Jared laughing)

8
00:00:12,589 --> 00:00:13,422
- [Jackson] Next me.

9
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:14,710
- Mom, your turn.

10
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,770
Good morning everyone.

11
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:18,610
Hope you're having an awesome day today.

12
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,936
We've got a visitor at our house.

13
00:00:20,936 --> 00:00:22,020
- Hi.

14
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,019
- Hi Grandma, how are you?
- We're running late.

15
00:00:24,019 --> 00:00:24,852
- We're getting ready.

16
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:26,540
We've been up early.

17
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,590
We are doing a photo shoot cooking day

18
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,450
with cookies and pies and cinnamon rolls.

19
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,560
- [Jared] Look at Jackson helping you out

20
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,585
with that chicken broth.

21
00:00:34,585 --> 00:00:35,418
- And a roast.

22
00:00:35,418 --> 00:00:37,160
- And a roast, yeah.
- And a roast.

23
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,260
- We've been up since about six o'clock

24
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,070
getting everything ready for this.

25
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:41,870
Mom, how early did you get up?

26
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,703
- About that.
- To do it?

27
00:00:42,703 --> 00:00:43,980
- About six o'clock.

28
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,610
We've got a pie.

29
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,280
Is this just cookin' something?

30
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,770
Oh look at those veggies.

31
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,410
It just smells good in this kitchen.

32
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,550
And that's the coolest part

33
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,640
about doing this cookbook,

34
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,041
is like, all these fun foods.

35
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:57,108
- 'Cause then we eat
to our heart's content.

36
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:57,941
- [Jared] Yeah.

37
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:00,960
- And Bonnie gave her
neighbors some food last time.

38
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,793
- [Jared] Uh-huh.

39
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:02,626
- My--

40
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:03,840
- Yeah and we've got
cookies too, we're doing.

41
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,870
- [Jared] Yeah, we've got
these little gingersnaps

42
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,400
and sugar snickerdoodles,
is that what they're called?

43
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,475
- Uh-huh, snickerdoodles.

44
00:01:09,475 --> 00:01:10,620
- [Jared] Snickerdoodles.

45
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,050
- [Grandma] Did you grow
up on snickerdoodles?

46
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,890
- We had our fair share of snickerdoodles,

47
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,156
we certainly did.

48
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:17,180
- Snickerdoodles or chocolate
chip, what was more--

49
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,150
- What was more prevalent at our house?

50
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,610
I would say sugar cookies, chocolate chips

51
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,150
and then maybe snickerdoodles after that.

52
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,140
- Snickerdoodles are probably the most

53
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,280
inexpensive cookie to make.

54
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,820
- And they're so stinking good,

55
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,653
they're just delicious.

56
00:01:30,653 --> 00:01:32,240
- We haven't made 'em in forever.

57
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,073
- [Jared] Yeah.

58
00:01:33,073 --> 00:01:33,906
- You have to start making cookies.

59
00:01:33,906 --> 00:01:35,340
- Can I do this part?

60
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,030
- [Ellie] Yeah you hold that for me.

61
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,060
- Okay you help Mom,
you're such a good helper.

62
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,850
But guess what, you're gonna
have to help me Jackson.

63
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,910
You, me and Calvin

64
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,990
are gonna go run some errands.

65
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,760
We're gonna go to the recycling center

66
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,542
and we're gonna go recycle
some cardboard, okay?

67
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:49,699
- [Ellie] Smell it, do you like it?

68
00:01:49,699 --> 00:01:50,532
- Uuuuh.

69
00:01:50,532 --> 00:01:51,388
(Jared laughs)

70
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:54,768
(bright guitar music)

71
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:56,140
- We're not quite there yet.

72
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,720
- [Ellie] Mom has brought
all of her goodies

73
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,630
and her camera.

74
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,980
Look at these pie pans.

75
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,990
How long have you been
using these pie pans

76
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,550
or bread pans.

77
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,412
- As long as I've been married.

78
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:17,612
- 30 years?
- 37 years.

79
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,860
- [Ellie] 37 years.

80
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,910
- Mom gave them to me,

81
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,310
Mom gave me some of them
- Awww.

82
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,750
when I went to college
before I got married.

83
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,330
- Those are used and abused

84
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,470
and they make some pretty good bread.

85
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,280
We have our set up here.

86
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,600
Mom and I are gonna do cinnamon rolls

87
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,880
and a pie.

88
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,770
Bonnie made cookies.

89
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,600
So we're gonna have a
cute shot, look at that.

90
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,070
- So we had a trailer full

91
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,160
of garbage and recyclables

92
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,220
and we recycled all that

93
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,040
and threw all of that away

94
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,480
and we surprised Grandma.

95
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,339
Hi Grandma.

96
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:49,172
- Hi.

97
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:50,360
- [Jared] With our favorite treat.

98
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,120
Jackson, what is our
favorite treat to get?

99
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,010
- Social cookies.

100
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:58,030
- [Jared] Social cookies from Swig.

101
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,610
We got Mom her favorite drink at Swig.

102
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,910
And my favorite drink.

103
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,470
And Dad is at a meeting right now.

104
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,303
- Yes.

105
00:03:04,303 --> 00:03:05,136
- We got him one too.

106
00:03:05,136 --> 00:03:07,960
But the Social cookies are my favorite,

107
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,070
these sugar cookies, we've talked

108
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,440
about 'em a lot before in the past,

109
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,100
but the Socials are my favorite,

110
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,300
because they're not too big,

111
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,220
but you still get that
sweet joy and happiness

112
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,682
from eating them.

113
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,260
(bright guitar music)

114
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,860
I just love these aluminum trailers,

115
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,640
because they're so light
and easy to maneuver.

116
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,290
I think the whole trailer weighs

117
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,860
like 700 pounds or something.

118
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,880
So that's pretty easy to
just lift and scoot back.

119
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,810
- [Ellie] I'm missing a biscuit,

120
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,730
so we'll just take a picture of that half,

121
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,990
and I'll eat that half.

122
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,910
Sound good?

123
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,830
- [Jared] So are we able
to eat some of this now,

124
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,060
can I have some of your
famous chicken pot pie?

125
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,019
- I'm plowing down.

126
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:42,852
(Jared laughs)

127
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:46,020
- This chicken pot pie is
one of my favorite meals.

128
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,380
That's the cool thing about this cookbook.

129
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,740
All of the stuff that we're making here,

130
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,600
is like oh that's my favorite.

131
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,630
Oh my gosh, that's the best.

132
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,490
Every meal that we put in here

133
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,732
is just so stinkin' good.

134
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:57,120
- Look at these bread tins.

135
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,030
Mom's had these for 37 years.

136
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,784
- [Jared] They have some love, don't they?

137
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,110
- She's been making 'em,

138
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,943
her Mom bought 'em for her,

139
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:05,830
making 'em for 20 years.

140
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,380
Mom's getting hers in the oven.

141
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,090
I'm just putting my
gravy and my roast away

142
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,020
and I'm wondering,

143
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,970
this is my great grandma's,

144
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,540
and it's a gravy boat,

145
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,130
why did they stop making
gravy boats like this?

146
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,650
Because you spill and
then this will catch it.

147
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,490
Why did they stop?

148
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,700
I'm gonna find one and buy one.

149
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,720
This one's Bonnie's.

150
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,970
I can't take hers, so.

151
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,570
- [Grandma] Is that Bonnie's?

152
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,310
- Yeah, that's an awesome idea.

153
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,960
- Ellie and I just got through
making this beautiful pie

154
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,360
and she's putting it in the oven

155
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,640
and we're doing it for our photo shoot.

156
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,063
- This has not come easy.

157
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:42,160
- [Grandma] It is beautiful.

158
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,336
It's gonna be beautiful.

159
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:44,654
- Yay!

160
00:04:44,654 --> 00:04:47,321
(playful music)

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,660
- What do you say we bring
things back up to speed.

162
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,480
How did you guys like that slo mo montage?

163
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,330
Was that pretty cool?

164
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,580
So Ellie's out delivering food

165
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,180
to one of our friends in the neighborhood.

166
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,720
Jackson's at a friend's house.

167
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,300
Calvin just woke up from a nap

168
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,140
and I want to show you where I found him.

169
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,190
Right here, perched on our bed,

170
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,060
cookie in hand that he got,
watching a little Netflix.

171
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,850
Calvin, did you do this all by yourself.

172
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,940
Oh you little sneaky boy.

173
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,490
These kids learn so fast
and it's crazy to me.

174
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,230
I am dying, where is the light,

175
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:20,066
I need to be able to see
your silly face, young man.

176
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:23,220
You are so much older
than you actually are

177
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,830
and it impresses me.

178
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,750
And I don't even realize what life

179
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,140
was like when I was Jackson's age.

180
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,660
I can't remember everything,

181
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,050
but I was on the phone with Ellie,

182
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:34,800
Jackson was over at the
neighbor's house playing

183
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,580
and Ellie and I were talking on the phone

184
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,310
and Ellie was like,
why don't you walk over

185
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:40,060
and grab Jackson so we can get ready

186
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,890
for dinner and everything.

187
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,070
I'm like yeah, that's a great idea.

188
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,030
It's about six o'clock,
we're gonna have dinner soon.

189
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,570
As soon as I opened the garage door

190
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,090
to go outside to get him,

191
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,810
guess who comes rolling up on the Segway,

192
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,660
big smile on his face,

193
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,490
he just finished playing with
his good buddy next door.

194
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,730
Jackson, hey, I'm talking about you.

195
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,830
Don't you go away.

196
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,043
Did you take the Segway
over to your friend's house?

197
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:03,876
- Yeah.

198
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:05,380
- And did you take the Segway back home

199
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,799
and park it in the garage?

200
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,632
- Mmm-hmm.

201
00:07:07,632 --> 00:07:08,465
- Yeah.

202
00:07:08,465 --> 00:07:09,298
(Jared laughs)

203
00:07:09,298 --> 00:07:10,131
He got off the Segway,

204
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,860
put it right back where it needs to go,

205
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,530
turned it off, and it
was so mature of Jackson.

206
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,060
It was the funniest thing.

207
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,680
If I have it on the camera,

208
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,910
I will put it up.

209
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,400
Hey bud.

210
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,329
- [Jackson] Hey.

211
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:27,852
- When did you get here?

212
00:07:27,852 --> 00:07:28,685
Careful.

213
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:31,839
- [Jackson] I've been to Ben's.

214
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,426
(Jared laughs)

215
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:34,759
- Give me a hug.

216
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,200
I think you're awesome, do you know that?

217
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,033
- Mmm-hmm.

218
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,310
- [Jared] What are you
doing with that spoon?

219
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,350
- Unlock the door.

220
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,200
- [Jared] Okay let's see.

221
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,040
Let's see what your mind is doing next.

222
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:48,920
(Jared laughs)

223
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,660
Oh my goodness, you boys.

224
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:55,490
And did you lock the door Calvin?

225
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,560
Oh my gosh, my little boys are growing up.

226
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,250
This is the life of a parent.

227
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,690
This is the life of having children.

228
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,940
They grow up, their brains get smarter

229
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,480
and they just do it faster than you think.

230
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,050
They do it faster than you think

231
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,170
and it's incredible, the
most humbling thing to see

232
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,300
is your own children
growing and developing.

233
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,300
Oh my gosh, it's so tender and sweet.

234
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,040
Sometimes they get into a little mischief,

235
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,832
but most of the time they're
doing fun stuff like this.

236
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:26,490
Ellie, do you think this will work?

237
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,343
You don't think it will?

238
00:08:28,343 --> 00:08:29,350
Let's try it.

239
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,644
Alright boys, circle up!

240
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,809
(crickets chirping)

241
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:35,372
Alright boys, circle up.

242
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:37,789
(crickets chirping)

243
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,929
Boys listen, this is
what we're gonna do okay?

244
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,799
I'm gonna say, alright boys come here

245
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,252
and then you come running
out as fast as you can.

246
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:45,280
And then it'll look like you're listening

247
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,113
the first time, okay?

248
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,100
Sound good?

249
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,933
Great.

250
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:49,150
Alright boys, come here!

251
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,552
Perfect.

252
00:08:52,552 --> 00:08:53,385
(Jared laughs)

253
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:55,929
Are you okay?

00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:59,267

(Jared laughing)

260
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,514
Okay, ready?

261
00:09:21,119 --> 00:09:22,610
- [Jackson] Next me.

262
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:23,890
- Mom your turn.

263
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,723
Now that I'm dizzy,

264
00:09:24,723 --> 00:09:26,988
we got to get these kids in their pajamas.

265
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:28,180
Touch, good girl.

266
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,758
Touch, good girl.

267
00:09:31,758 --> 00:09:34,246
That was a very good girl Penny.

268
00:09:34,246 --> 00:09:35,879
That was a good girl.

269
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,344
That was a good girl, yeah.

270
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,940
That is where we're
gonna end our vlog today,

271
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,910
with some training with Penny.

272
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,150
We've been having a lot of fun
doing some of these classes

273
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,110
and training a little bit more on our own.

274
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,880
So thank you so much for
watching the video today.

275
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,040
If you guys enjoyed it, be
sure to give it a big thumbs up

276
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,340
and we will see you tomorrow.

277
00:09:50,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
