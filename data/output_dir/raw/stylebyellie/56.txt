1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,920
- I don't know if that's good or not.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,753
Only time will tell.
- I'm sure--

3
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,061
I'm sure it will be very hydrating.

4
00:00:04,061 --> 00:00:04,894
(gasps)

5
00:00:04,894 --> 00:00:06,286
- Only time will tell!

6
00:00:06,286 --> 00:00:07,928
(Jared laughs)

7
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:08,838

00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:09,696
♪ Because ev-- ♪

9
00:00:09,696 --> 00:00:10,554
(Ellie laughs)

10
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:12,410
- Yeah you hear that word positivity

11
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,930
and it's like so easy to hear and say,

12
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:16,710
but hard to do, it really is sometimes,

13
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,670
especially when you just don't feel it.

14
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:20,249
- [Jared] Who drinks Diet Coke?

15
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:21,082
- [Calvin] Foo.

16
00:00:21,082 --> 00:00:22,032
- I did.

17
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:24,010
- What?
- What?

18
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:25,330
- Grandma!
- Where?

19
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,600
- Hey, so I just have a
quick question for you,

20
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,950
are you guys happy that you live

21
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,320
next to each other or something,

22
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,828
because I feel this is your
homeostasis right here.

23
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,780
(laughing)

24
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:38,613
- I love it.

25
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:40,410
- I don't think this to pick so hard,

26
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,855
we've been working.

27
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:42,871
(laughing)

28
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,070
- Well that is so true,

29
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,060
that is so true.

30
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,893
- You think we're just sitting here

31
00:00:45,893 --> 00:00:46,870
just laying and lounging.

32
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:49,080
- We are getting ready to go to a meeting.

33
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,940
- Yeah, they have a meeting
in just a little bit

34
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,610
and Ellie is getting the gas tank full,

35
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:58,070
or let me be more appropriate

36
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,323
for 2017, charging the
battery to your Tesla.

37
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:03,010
(joke ba-dum-ching)

38
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,236
Oh, everyone just went
oh Jared gross awww.

39
00:01:07,236 --> 00:01:09,440
- Yes, Bonnie actually gave this to me

40
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,610
for dinner last night.

41
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,990
It's lasagna, but instead of meat,

42
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,646
it has tons of vegetables in it.

43
00:01:13,646 --> 00:01:15,070
- You know what and Ellie, when she gave

44
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:15,903
it to me last night,

45
00:01:15,903 --> 00:01:16,736
she was like, I'm kinda worried,

46
00:01:16,736 --> 00:01:18,160
because there's no meat in it.

47
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,540
It was really delicious.
- I didn't say that.

48
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:20,740
- Did I?
- Yeah you said something--

49
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,573
- Yeah.

50
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:22,970
- I wanted to know if you liked it.

51
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:23,803
- [Jared] Oh it was delicious.

52
00:01:23,803 --> 00:01:24,636
- I knew she would love it.
- Yeah.

53
00:01:24,636 --> 00:01:25,469
- Did you honestly like it?

54
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:26,680
- Yeah I had it for dinner last night,

55
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,550
it was really great.
- Good.

56
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,030
- I don't remember saying that.

57
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,620
- Yeah, well I think you
said more along the lines of

58
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,850
I'm anxious to know what you think,

59
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,888
because there's no meat,
it's a veggie meal.

60
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,890
- It has mushrooms in it.

61
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,570
- And I'll tell you what I told my kids.

62
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,234
Eat it with the noodles
and you won't even know

63
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,417
there was a mushroom.

64
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,839
- Don't tell Julie.

65
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:44,672
(laughing)

66
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:46,650
- [Jared] Well oh my
goodness, Hi Sister Sue,

67
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,950
are you gonna help me work today?

68
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,783
Huh?

69
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:50,910
You popping here to say hello

70
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,230
and help me get some work done?

71
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,050
You love those ear scratches don't ya?

72
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,147
Is that the spot right there?

73
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:57,750
Oh that's the spot, oh
yes that's the spot.

74
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,390
She was chewing on my Bob Ross
socks a little bit earlier,

75
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,860
nibblin' my toes.

76
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,390
These are cool sockes, huh?

77
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,480
I showed them to you last
Sunday I think it was.

78
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,313
(panting)

79
00:02:07,313 --> 00:02:09,060
Hey, I know you want attention right now,

80
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,630
I know it, that's all
you want is attention.

81
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,340
You just want me to
scratch you and never stop.

82
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,480
And my Bob Ross socks are too
cool for school right now.

83
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,313
Ah!

84
00:02:18,313 --> 00:02:21,140
Of course, now you're sleeping on the job.

85
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,570
I see how it is.

86
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,590
As soon as I ask for help,
(snaps fingers) sleep.

87
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,480
- [Ellie] That's not what I thought

88
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,595
nipple creme would feel like.

89
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:30,200
- It feels different than--

90
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,460
- [Ellie] Feel it.

91
00:02:33,536 --> 00:02:34,369
- Oh it's hard.

92
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:35,740
- [Ellie] I know.

93
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,220
- It's a hard nipple creme.

94
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:41,210
- So I got some nipple creme
for when I have the baby.

95
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,010
It's supposed to be really good

96
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:47,330
and doesn't have lots of bad stuff in it.

97
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,510
It's Marcelle Nipple Creme.

98
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,720
- Marcel the Shell?

99
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,620
- Mar, I think that's the brand.

100
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:57,290
So I ordered a few maternity clothes.

101
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,640
This is one of them.

102
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,980
- [Jared] Ooh you look so nice.

103
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
- And I ordered this too,

104
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:03,370
because last time I just used coconut oil

105
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:06,040
and it was the most
painful thing in the world.

106
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,690
Same with Jackson, but
I used lanolin creme.

107
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,730
This is lanolin free.

108
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,770
But that's what I used with Jackson.

109
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,460
So I have this one for this baby,

110
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,610
but I got this shirt,

111
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,650
and then Jared and I are
going to a fun little--

112
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,483
- [Jared] Getaway.

113
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:22,316
- Getaway.

114
00:03:22,316 --> 00:03:24,230
And so, I'm wearing this shirt when we go.

115
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,248
- That looks really nice.

116
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:26,140
- Cute, huh?

117
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,973
- [Jared] Yeah.

118
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:27,806
- So I got those from Tyme.

119
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,700
I asked you guys on
Twitter what some websites

120
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,020
to go to for maternity clothes

121
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,600
and one of them, you guys suggest Thyme.

122
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,120
T-H-Y-M-E.

123
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,781
So I got a few things.
- Like the spice?

124
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,770
- Yeah, so I got a few things.

125
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,633
And I'm excited.

126
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,466
- [Jared] Yeah.

127
00:03:40,466 --> 00:03:41,780
- And I've just kinda been cleaning

128
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,420
on this cold winter day.

129
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,970
I got these emptied, cleaned my shoes.

130
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,840
- Well the thing about nipple creme Ellie

131
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,790
is I wish I could give some
advice to you about it,

132
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,920
but I've never had to
use nipple creme before.

133
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,130
- Duh, you don't have any advice to give.

134
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,130
- Right, I've never had to
use nipple creme before,

135
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,028
so I don't know if that's good or not.

136
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:01,230
Only Thyme will tell.

137
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,518
- I'm sure it will be very hydrating.

138
00:04:02,518 --> 00:04:03,351
(gasps)

139
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:04,769
- Only Thyme will tell!

140
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:05,910
(Jared laughing)

141
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,536
- You think you're really funny, you are.

142
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:08,950
- That's funny.

143
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,445
Oh that was an unintentional pun.

144
00:04:11,445 --> 00:04:12,278
- That was cute.

145
00:04:12,278 --> 00:04:13,111
- That was good.

146
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:14,080
- [Ellie] I totally forgot.

147
00:04:15,691 --> 00:04:19,620
But why would I think
to forget your prize?

148
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,470
What did you get in there?

149
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,303
- [Calvin] Choo choo.

150
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,300
- [Ellie] The choo choo?

151
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,200
Hi Dad.

152
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,940
- Hi, we are just playing Peppa Pig.

153
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,070
- [Ellie] Wow, Peppa Pig?

154
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,300
- [Jared] They have bunk beds.

155
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,210
- [Ellie] So cute.

156
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,043
- And we are watching,

157
00:04:34,043 --> 00:04:35,040
Calvin what's his name?

158
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,250
- Calvin, what did you just do?

159
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,650
- Pee pee!

160
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,638
- You pee peed?

161
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:40,471
- Yeah.

162
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,304
- Yeah, you peed in the toilet!

163
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,510
Good job Mr. Cal--

164
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,177
now he's like, where's my chocolate milk.

165
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:47,309
- [Jared] Where's my Peppa Pig?

166
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,142
(laughing)

167
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:51,750
- I've tried to have
my week be pretty empty

168
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,840
and not have a lot of things

169
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,830
I've had to do this week,

170
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:55,580
so we could really focus on Calvin

171
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,920
and potty training.

172
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,080
And the next three days are completely

173
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,960
empty and good, and so we're gonna

174
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,760
continue working on him
with potty training.

175
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,480
I would say, because we kinda had started,

176
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,820
Sunday I wouldn't really count,

177
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,129
I would say Monday is a good official day

178
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:15,466
and I would say, how
do you think it's been?

179
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:17,870
Now Monday, now today.

180
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,400
- I feel it's gone like this.

181
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,193
- [Ellie] Yeah.

182
00:05:21,193 --> 00:05:23,530
- We're on the uphill part

183
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,610
of potty training.
- Yeah.

184
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,790
- Yesterday was pretty tough.

185
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,540
- I would say that too.

186
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,440
I kinda just want him to feel relaxed,

187
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,090
and I don't want to feel pushy

188
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,840
and if he goes in the potty great,

189
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,750
if he doesn't, we'll just tell him,

190
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,140
Calvin, where do we go potty?

191
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,830
And he'll tell me and he'll learn.

192
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,978
And I'm just excited that
we're getting this down.

193
00:05:41,978 --> 00:05:42,811
- Oh yeah.

194
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:44,920
- [Ellie] Especially in the
winter months, might as well.

195
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,730
- And having only one
kid in diapers is great,

196
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,010
so hopefully he's all the way good

197
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,230
when the new baby comes.

198
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,063
- [Ellie] Totes.

199
00:05:52,063 --> 00:05:53,450
I love this little thing.

200
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,440
- You should've hard
Calvin talking and playing,

201
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,080
he's like oh there, ba
ba ba, oh George, yeah.

202
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,640
- [Ellie] Awww cute.

203
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,880
We got this when we were in South Carolina

204
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,117
for your family reunion.

205
00:06:04,117 --> 00:06:04,950
- That's right.

206
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,210
- [Ellie] We bought it to
have a toy at that house

207
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,990
and it's been so cute.

208
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:10,470
- It's the lake house.

209
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,070
- [Ellie] The lake house?

210
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,446
Do you remember picking out sea shells?

211
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,279
- Uh-huh.

212
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:16,350
- Who did we give some to?

213
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,382
We picked up some seashells for who?

214
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:19,215
- Grandma.

215
00:06:19,215 --> 00:06:20,048
- That's right.

216
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,556
- [Ellie] Yeah, we're gonna
try that again sometime, huh?

217
00:06:21,556 --> 00:06:22,389
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

218
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,370
- There's your bunk bed bud.

219
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,203
- [Ellie] Show me.

220
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:26,080
You got a prize?

221
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,913
Can I see it.

222
00:06:28,876 --> 00:06:31,390
Whoa, the choo choo train.

223
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,100
I almost forgot to give him a prize.

224
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,040
Caught you in a yawn.

225
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,654
- Second you caught me in a yawn.

226
00:06:36,654 --> 00:06:37,940
(laughing)

227
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,420
- He went potty and I was like good job

228
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,738
and we walked out, and he goes prize.

229
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:45,260
He definitely remembers
the times he needs a prize,

230
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,947
because sometimes I'm
like you didn't go potty,

231
00:06:46,947 --> 00:06:48,460
you don't get a prize right now.

232
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,840
- You know what's funny is yesterday

233
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,070
at the end of the blog, I was like,

234
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,470
it's gonna be a pretty rough night.

235
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,990
And you just caught me
in the middle of a yawn,

236
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,695
and I was like oh I'm pretty tired still.

237
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:57,710
That was a pretty rough night.

238
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,543
- [Ellie] Yeah how was our night?

239
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,376
It wasn't too bad.

240
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:00,229
- Diet coke!
- It wasn't as bad

241
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,619
- as I thought it was gonna be.

242
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:04,277
- Diet Coke, Diet Coke.

243
00:07:04,277 --> 00:07:05,350
- [Ellie] Did you say Diet Coke?

244
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,340
- Yeah, you've been hanging around Grandma

245
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,173
a little too much.

246
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:10,780
- Oh my gosh.
- Diet Coke!

247
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,921
- Thanks Grandma.
- Diet Coke!

248
00:07:11,921 --> 00:07:13,737
- [Jared] Who drinks diet coke?

249
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:14,570
- [Calvin] Foo.

250
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,128
- I did.

251
00:07:16,128 --> 00:07:17,838
- What?
- What?

252
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:19,453
- Grandma!
- Where?

253
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:20,940
- [Ellie] What?

254
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,219
- Okay, we are very very careful

255
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:27,060
about letting our kids drink soda.

256
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,180
And I guess grandma's have a special--

257
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,100
- Grandma's can, because
you're the grandma

258
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,933
and you can do what you want.

259
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:33,292
(laughing)

260
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:34,125
Calvin.

261
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:35,120
- What's your great idea Mom?

262
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,306
What's your great idea?
- Okay, close your eyes.

263
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:38,398
(laughing)

264
00:07:38,398 --> 00:07:39,826

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
- You know what, Simon Cowell?

283
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,785
That just means I'm gonna practice harder.

Goodnight.

291
00:08:42,553 --> 00:08:45,090
(gentle music)

292
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,390
The boys are asleep and Ellie is

293
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,860
at a church activity,
where they are talking

294
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,690
about mental health, specifically
during the wintertime.

295
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,230
Yesterday I think it was,

296
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,320
Jackson and I were on a walk with Penny

297
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,570
and we were talking
about the winter blues,

298
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,870
and so I'm anxious for Ellie to get home

299
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,350
and talk to us about what
they're talking about,

300
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:09,400
they have a mental health expert there

301
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,750
who's going over all of this stuff,

302
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,680
so I'm anxious for her to get home

303
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,550
and to learn about everything
they talked about, so.

304
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,470
For now, I'm just cleaning up this mess

305
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,128
of a living room, because
we've had fun today

306
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,710
playing with all of these toys.

307
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,850
And the guitar, we busted out the guitar

308
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,980
after we played on the piano.

309
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,300
She wants those frillies.

310
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,267
- I know, well we--

311
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,420
You silly girl.

312
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,720
She's been sitting here
playing for 20 minutes

313
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,600
and she's been so soft.

314
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
We were bonding and then you got up.

315
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,160
- [Jared] I'm sorry I ruined your bonding.

316
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,520
- I just got back from
a fun church activity

317
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,290
and there was a health care
professional that came.

318
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,090
And we just talked a lot
about our mental health

319
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,430
and it was just really nice to hear.

320
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,660
It was a boost for me,

321
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,120
because this whole week I've felt very

322
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,710
not myself, especially mentally,

323
00:09:58,247 --> 00:09:59,750
maybe it could be a little pregnancy,

324
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,160
maybe it could be a little winter blues,

325
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,070
I don't know what it is,

326
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,830
but I just haven't felt myself.

327
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,810
So it was really good going to this

328
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,700
and just hearing about life
and about just positivity

329
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,070
and it's like yeah, you
hear that word positivity

330
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,590
and it's like so easy to hear and say,

331
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,390
but hard to do, it really is sometimes,

332
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,560
especially when you just don't feel it.

333
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,410
When you feel down and blue.

334
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,540
He talked a lot about social media too

335
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,620
and the good effects that social media is

336
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,080
and the harmful effects
that social media has

337
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,050
and that kinda weighed heavy on me

338
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,150
and Jared and I talked a lot and--

339
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,580
- Well yeah, social media is our

340
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,670
livelihood right now.
- Life.

341
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,930
- And it can get to the point

342
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,500
where it becomes
addictions for some people.

343
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,260
And it can become
overwhelming for some people.

344
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,990
And we are on a fine line,

345
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,220
where because this is our livelihood,

346
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,540
we're usually on social media quite a bit.

347
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,490
And so we have to find that balance,

348
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,940
what works best for us
mentally, physically

349
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,620
and for our family emotionally

350
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,130
and all that sort of thing.
- Totally.

351
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,970
- And I encourage all of
us to find that balance,

352
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,130
not just you and me Ellie,
- Totally.

353
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:08,200
- but all of us, you included.

354
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,750
- I do like that Jared
and I check in a lot.

355
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,150
Like this week, you've noticed

356
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,120
that Jared's filmed a lot and I haven't

357
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,720
and most of that has been
because I've been trying

358
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,740
to work with Calvin on potty training

359
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,750
and he hasn't been dressed,

360
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,563
so it's me and Calvin are doing our thing.

361
00:11:24,563 --> 00:11:27,430
Another big part of it is just mentally.

362
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,330
I just have been in a mental slump,

363
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,190
and so Jared's helped take over.

364
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,630
And some days, some weeks I do that,

365
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,238
and it's mostly me and the kids,

366
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:40,900
we kind of take turns doing stuff.

367
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,610
So I just appreciate Jared this week.

368
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,170
I'm really glad that I
went to this meeting.

369
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,760
I didn't want to, but then when I did,

370
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,180
I felt good about it.

371
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,764
Same with activity days the other day,

372
00:11:48,764 --> 00:11:51,030
I was a little stressed,

373
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,160
not even stressed, just a little down

374
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,930
and then I just thought, what am I doing,

375
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:57,120
I can't have nine girls come over

376
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
and teach 'em how to cook

377
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,650
and be entertaining and play with them,

378
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,490
but then once they came,
it was really refreshing

379
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,760
and I had so much fun

380
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,210
and it was actually really uplifting

381
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,330
and it's service.

382
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,500
That was service.

383
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,880
I invited people into my home

384
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,940
and it felt really good to do so.

385
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,603
- Well I'm glad that made
you feel a little bit better

386
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:14,445
- [Ellie] Yeah, totally.

387
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:16,250
- and I have something prepared

388
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,900
to make you feel even more better.

389
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,733
- [Ellie] A song?

390
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:20,204
