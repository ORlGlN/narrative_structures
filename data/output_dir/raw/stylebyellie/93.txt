1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,333
- It's freezing.

2
00:00:02,199 --> 00:00:05,137
- It's freezing, good
morning, happy do year.

3
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:06,322
Happy do year?

4
00:00:06,322 --> 00:00:07,887
I was trying to say how are you

5
00:00:07,887 --> 00:00:10,514
and happy new year at the same time.

6
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:11,578
Good morning guys!

7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,868
It is a beautiful, cold day today,

8
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:15,627
and we're meeting up with my family

9
00:00:15,627 --> 00:00:17,248
to have breakfast because Jenn

10
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:19,991
is going back home, something like that.

11
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:23,316
- I'm gonna find a good seat like that.

12
00:00:23,316 --> 00:00:24,312
- [Dad] Like this up here?

13
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:25,145
- [Boy] Huh.

14
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,930
- [Dad] Calvin is that
your seat for the day?

15
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:29,841
You like it up there,
perched up in the corner?

16
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:32,226
- I wanna get in the corner.

17
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:35,407
- [Dad] (laughing) Sometimes
that's a good thing

18
00:00:35,407 --> 00:00:36,815
and sometimes that's a bad thing.

19
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:39,815
(jingle bell music)

20
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,986
- [Mom] That's a C, try the C then.

21
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,069
- [Boy] Okay.

22
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:50,530
- [Mom] Now try a K.

23
00:00:53,006 --> 00:00:54,839
Oh and the other line.

24
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:57,712
Oh okay, now the O.

25
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:05,868
Pretty good!

26
00:01:07,437 --> 00:01:08,917
- [Dad] (laughing)
these two kids over here

27
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,000
have become besties, huh?

28
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,855
(laughing) oh he's like
oh the camera's on,

29
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:15,826
gotta get closer to Jackson,

30
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:17,290
prove our friendship, huh.

31
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,554
- Well we have a little good news.

32
00:01:18,554 --> 00:01:20,296
Little good and little bad.

33
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:22,339
I took Calvin to the doctor 'cause he was

34
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:25,020
crying so bad last
night that his ear hurt.

35
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,067
He's getting his two
year old molars in still

36
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,177
and the doctor said he
had a little infection

37
00:01:31,177 --> 00:01:33,677
and so he prescribed us some medicine but

38
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,923
he said to keep him just on some ibuprofen

39
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,775
for like a day to see if that will help

40
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,594
'cause there wasn't a ton of infection

41
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:41,937
but it was there.

42
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:43,937
But, guys, are we ready?

43
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:46,870
What are we gonna do now?

44
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,070
- We're cleaning up and going to the store

45
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,153
and get some gifts for
us, for Calvin and for me.

46
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:57,481
- [Mom] Yeah, we are going to work

47
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:01,637
and if you and Calvin do your jobs,

48
00:02:01,637 --> 00:02:03,440
you guys get some money.

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,591
And then we'll go to the store and

50
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,749
you each will pick out
a gift for each other

51
00:02:06,749 --> 00:02:08,416
for Christmas, okay?

52
00:02:09,578 --> 00:02:11,607
Does that sound fun to pick out a gift?

53
00:02:11,607 --> 00:02:12,879
- When is Christmas?

54
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,963
- [Mom] And then in a
few days we'll wrap it,

55
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:16,017
we'll put it under the tree, and then in

56
00:02:16,017 --> 00:02:18,168
a few days you guys can open it!

57
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,751
- Oh, oh, oh, yeah.

58
00:02:20,788 --> 00:02:21,823
- [Mom] Does that sound like a good idea?

59
00:02:21,823 --> 00:02:22,656
- Yeah.

60
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:25,447
- [Mom] Okay you know what
chore I want you to do?

61
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:28,892
I want you to wipe up
all of the doorknobs,

62
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:31,246
so that they're nice and clean.

63
00:02:31,246 --> 00:02:32,160
So I'll give you some--

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,879
- Where's the knobs?

65
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:34,878
- [Mom] The knobs.

66
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,064
You show me where doorknobs are,

67
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:37,280
show me where they are.

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,327
- Are these, is this it?

69
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,742
- [Mom] Yep, those are the doorknobs.

70
00:02:40,742 --> 00:02:42,291
So I'm gonna give you a cloth and I'm

71
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:44,040
gonna have you wipe them up all up,

72
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,366
that's your job, okay?

73
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:46,319
- With water?

74
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,902
- [Mom] With a cloth,
like a sanitize wipe.

75
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,222
Okay go wipe the bathrooms now.

76
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,333
Now the other one.

77
00:03:08,854 --> 00:03:10,657
Here's the cloth.

78
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:14,420
Okay look, can you see
all the dirty spots?

79
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,010
You wipe those really good.

80
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,677
- More.
- Yep, more.

81
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,457
Yeah and right here.

82
00:03:20,457 --> 00:03:21,290
- [Boy] Yeah.

83
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,135
- That looks like a booger.

84
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:23,156
Right here.

85
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,361
Haha, it probably is.

86
00:03:24,361 --> 00:03:26,807
I remember last year
the kids got each other

87
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:29,692
a little gift for each other to open up

88
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:31,853
and for some reason,
it wasn't that I didn't

89
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,231
want to do it this year
but I just thought oh,

90
00:03:34,231 --> 00:03:37,499
I don't know, I don't
know what I was thinking.

91
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:40,094
And then my friend the
other day she was like,

92
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,950
oh my kids are so excited,
I had them do chores

93
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,981
to earn money, and we
got the house cleaned

94
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:47,698
and then we went and picked out a gift.

95
00:03:47,698 --> 00:03:50,245
And I was like, I'm gonna totally do that!

96
00:03:50,245 --> 00:03:54,087
So the kids are working and I'm helping

97
00:03:54,087 --> 00:03:56,613
and we're just doing extra things like

98
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:59,523
all of this stuff, it's just so sticky

99
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:01,108
and the doorknobs.

100
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,098
So we're wiping up,
Jackson's wiping up some

101
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:07,115
doorknobs, sanitizing
them, making sure none of

102
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:09,398
us get sick, and the kids
will go pick out a gift

103
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:12,112
for each other and I'm
really excited for that.

104
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:15,279
It's crazy how fast stuff gets sticky.

105
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,735
This wasn't too bad, it's mostly the kids.

106
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,376
The kids drawer 'cause
they always open up that

107
00:04:24,376 --> 00:04:26,790
to get all their plates and stuff out.

108
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,090
How are we doing down here Jacks?

109
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,743
- I'm still doing some knobs.

110
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:33,134
- Okay, you're doing all the knobs.

111
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:35,094
Calvin what are you doing?

112
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:36,473
The wall?

113
00:04:36,473 --> 00:04:39,415
Okay (laughing)

114
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,353
You are doing so good.

115
00:04:41,353 --> 00:04:42,794
I'm gonna let you finish making your bed

116
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:45,278
while I have Calvin do a chore, okay?

117
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:46,539
Kinda rushed out of the house today,

118
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,378
I didn't even do my own
chores which is my bed.

119
00:04:49,378 --> 00:04:51,211
I need to make my bed.

120
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:56,983
As good as it's gonna get!

121
00:04:56,983 --> 00:04:58,872
- You have to close your eyes.

122
00:04:58,872 --> 00:04:59,973
- [Mom] Okay my eyes are closed.

123
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,473
- Don't open them.

124
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:04,981
- [Mom] Ugh! Couch.

125
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:07,863
Gotta tell me where to walk.

126
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:09,370
Ugh! The stairs!

127
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,833
You gotta tell me how to walk.

128
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,860
Is there a stair in front of me?

129
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,143
Okay tell me, say step.

130
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:16,204
- Step.

131
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:18,871
- [Mom] Oh, I'm nervous to fall.

132
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:20,632
- Step.

133
00:05:20,632 --> 00:05:21,555
- [Mom] Oh, step, okay.

134
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,388
- Step.

135
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,573
- [Mom] Okay, good, you're
doing better at navigating me.

136
00:05:25,573 --> 00:05:27,297
- Step, step.

137
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:28,526
(laughing)

138
00:05:28,526 --> 00:05:29,639
Open them!

139
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,602
- [Mom] Oh, that looks pretty good.

140
00:05:32,602 --> 00:05:35,917
Good job, that looks pretty dang good.

141
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:39,093
You got the zipper there, okay.

142
00:05:39,093 --> 00:05:40,487
You got your toys under your pillow

143
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:42,961
like you always have before bed, huh,

144
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:45,412
you always put toys under your pillow.

145
00:05:45,412 --> 00:05:46,802
Good job, mister!

146
00:05:46,802 --> 00:05:48,252
- Yeah!

147
00:05:48,252 --> 00:05:50,250
- Who wants to help me do the dishes?

148
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,268
- [Boy] Me, me!

149
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,685
- Okay come help.

150
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:59,331
Oh, and this one.

151
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:00,414
And this one.

152
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:07,402
Thank you, you are being a good helper.

153
00:06:08,757 --> 00:06:11,840
That's what I do love about kids like

154
00:06:13,056 --> 00:06:15,525
they wanna help, they want to help you

155
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:18,111
in the kitchen, they want to help stir

156
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:21,344
the pancake mix, they want to help you and

157
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:24,927
I think sometimes, life
is busy and parents

158
00:06:26,388 --> 00:06:27,856
sometimes we just get
overwhelmed, we're like

159
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:29,449
no, no, no, we'll just do it, 'cause it's

160
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:31,976
easier and faster, but it's--
- What about these ones?

161
00:06:31,976 --> 00:06:32,861
- What about those ones?

162
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:33,694
Those are put away.

163
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,372
What about your cups?

164
00:06:35,372 --> 00:06:37,138
What about, you know where these go.

165
00:06:37,138 --> 00:06:40,393
Why don't you go put all of these away.

166
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,226
- [Boy] Okay.

167
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:43,774
- Yup, go put all of those away.

168
00:06:43,774 --> 00:06:46,846
And it's like if we can
just spend the extra time

169
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,686
and let them help us, it really does

170
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:50,432
so good for them.

171
00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:53,098
They want to help, like I don't even care

172
00:06:53,098 --> 00:06:54,760
if he helps me right now with dishes

173
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,679
but he wants to help.

174
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:00,429
Good job and we're trying
to earn some money.

175
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,520
A little faster.

176
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,103
- Super duper fast!

177
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:16,257
- Holy moly, you're in fast mode!

178
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,364
Holy moly, Jackson Clark!

179
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:20,706
Jackson Clark Wigham, he is so fast,

180
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,377
so he wants to buy his
brother a present so bad.

181
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,220
- It's almost finished!

182
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,158
- Good job, keep going fast, fast, fast!

183
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:28,837
Mister Jackson Clark Wigham is gonna go

184
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:30,426
full speeding fast everybody!

185
00:07:30,426 --> 00:07:32,631
He is using his hands,
he is using his fingers,

186
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:34,756
he is moving so fast
because he wants to earn

187
00:07:34,756 --> 00:07:37,006
every single dollar so
he can buy the coolest,

188
00:07:37,006 --> 00:07:39,414
newest toy on the market!

189
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:41,329
I hope they advertise good for this.

190
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:42,827
This toy that he is gonna buy because it's

191
00:07:42,827 --> 00:07:44,410
gonna last so long!

192
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,987
I don't even know if I'm making sense.

193
00:07:49,874 --> 00:07:51,307
I always loved it when my brother Bo

194
00:07:51,307 --> 00:07:53,306
had me for Christmas
because he always got me

195
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:55,617
the coolest gifts, and I
still have a lot of the

196
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:57,544
gifts that he got me.

197
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,704
- We're at the store right now, Jackson,

198
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,191
and what are you going to do?

199
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:04,370
- I'm gonna pick, find a gift for Calvin.

200
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,378
- Yeah, so let's go through
all of the aisles and

201
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:08,698
we'll pick a gift that you
wanna get Calvin, okay?

202
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:09,531
- Okay.

203
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,880
- [Dad] So you think of
what Calvin might like

204
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,973
and enjoy and then we'll get something

205
00:08:11,973 --> 00:08:13,273
for him, okay?

206
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:14,106
- Okay.

207
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:14,939
- [Dad] Does that sound good?

208
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:15,772
Alright, let's go.

209
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:18,164
Do you think Calvin would like a shovel?

210
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:18,997
- No!

211
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:19,830
- [Dad] No, that's right.

212
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,127
Let's try something else.

213
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,867
What about a fan?

214
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:23,700
- [Jackson] No!

215
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,279
- [Dad] No, okay let's keep lookin'.

216
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,012
- What about a nerf gun?

217
00:08:29,012 --> 00:08:31,546
- [Dad] Oh he might like
a nerf gun, that's cool.

218
00:08:31,546 --> 00:08:32,417
- [Boy] Yeah.

219
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,337
- [Dad] Do you think Calvin would like a

220
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,927
GoPro Hero 6?

221
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:35,760
I think he would.

222
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,593
- No uh.

223
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:37,482
- [Dad] Okay.

224
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,127
- That's for adults.

225
00:08:39,128 --> 00:08:40,524
(laughing)

226
00:08:40,524 --> 00:08:41,597
Oh, what about batman.

227
00:08:41,597 --> 00:08:43,227
- [Dad] Oh I think he likes Batman a lot,

228
00:08:43,227 --> 00:08:44,367
that might be cool.

229
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,570
Jackson, turn around!

230
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,618
- Put it in the cart.

231
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,207
He went, I can go show Jacks!

232
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,869
(laughing)

233
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,086
- [Dad] Oh, don't look,
don't look, no peeking,

234
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:53,465
no peeking, no peeking!

235
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,394
- Did Calvin get a toy for me?

236
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:57,296
- You guys get out of here.

237
00:08:57,296 --> 00:08:58,604
- [Dad] Did you feel
like you did good today?

238
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,252
Did you pick out some
good gifts for each other?

239
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,169
Yeah? Good.

240
00:09:02,118 --> 00:09:03,427
So this is Jackson's favorite way

241
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:04,387
to travel on the cart.

242
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:06,173
He likes to face forward
standing on the edge

243
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:08,466
with his arms holding on backwards.

244
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,050
Kind of like on the front of a ship.

245
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,803
You're like the mermaid
on the front of the ship.

246
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,962
- [Mom] Are you ready to help me?

247
00:09:14,962 --> 00:09:15,826
- Yep!

248
00:09:15,826 --> 00:09:17,568
- [Mom] Okay this is Calvin's gift.

249
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:20,959
Do you wanna use that one or this one?

250
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,792
- Um this one.

251
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:22,625
- Perfect.

252
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:30,051
I need one piece of tape, ready?

253
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:32,480
That's a big piece.

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,911
Next time do it just a
little smaller, okay?

255
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:35,755
- Okay.

256
00:09:35,755 --> 00:09:37,422
- Put it right here.

257
00:09:41,749 --> 00:09:43,099
- I wanna piece.

258
00:09:43,099 --> 00:09:44,766
- Put it right here.

259
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:48,016
Did you have fun today?

260
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:49,136
- Yeah.

261
00:09:49,136 --> 00:09:51,597
- Did you have fun
picking Calvin out a gift?

262
00:09:51,597 --> 00:09:52,430
- Uh huh.

263
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,128
- [Mom] You gonna help wrap the box?

264
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:54,961
- Yeah!

265
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:55,794
- [Mom] Could put it under the tree,

266
00:09:55,794 --> 00:09:56,627
is that one yours?

267
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:57,627
It is yours!

268
00:09:58,581 --> 00:09:59,414
- Mine?

269
00:09:59,414 --> 00:10:01,119
- [Mom] Yeah, that one is yours.

270
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:03,785
The one under it is yours.

271
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,963
Look, this one's yours Calvin,

272
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:08,831
and this one's Jackson's.

273
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:09,664
- [Boy] Mine?

274
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:10,497
- Yes!

275
00:10:10,497 --> 00:10:12,621
You guys worked so hard today.

276
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:13,882
That was really fun.

277
00:10:13,882 --> 00:10:17,570
I mean it was a little intense at Target,

278
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,090
having them pick something out,

279
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,561
but we really did try and like let them

280
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:23,400
find something for the other person,

281
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,459
especially when Jackson found Calvin's,

282
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,722
he was like Calvin would love this!

283
00:10:27,722 --> 00:10:28,961
It was really fun.

284
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,131
- I think these guys
are having a little fun

285
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,708
without me right now,

286
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:34,499
and I'm about to put it to a stop

287
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,762
so I can come in and join them.

288
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:37,595
You look so--

289
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,847
- Glad you turned on that light

290
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:39,680
(laughing)

291
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,274
I'm surprised the kids haven't yet.

292
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:43,201
- You guys look so cuddly up there.

293
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,258
You guys watching a show?

294
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,219
Uh oh.

295
00:10:46,219 --> 00:10:47,930
(laughing)

296
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,943
After a long day of
driving and getting gifts

297
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,519
and presents and wrapping them,

298
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,011
we're gonna cuddle together on the bed

299
00:10:56,011 --> 00:10:57,902
and watch Troll Hunters.

300
00:10:57,902 --> 00:10:59,373
- What is the one room we use the most

301
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:00,513
out of the house?

302
00:11:00,513 --> 00:11:02,362
- Oh, one hundred percent our bedroom.

303
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,048
- Even the kids, like
we are in here so much.

304
00:11:05,048 --> 00:11:05,887
- All the time.

305
00:11:05,887 --> 00:11:07,542
- Like whether it's just us getting ready

306
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,781
and the kids are following us,

307
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,364
or they love to lay on our bed,

308
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,706
I think it's kinda fun.

309
00:11:13,706 --> 00:11:15,514
We use our bed a lot (laughing).

310
00:11:15,514 --> 00:11:16,347
- Yes we do.

311
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:18,073
Jackson is just begging
to turn off the light,

312
00:11:18,073 --> 00:11:20,093
he just hopped off the bed, he's like

313
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:21,407
okay I'm ready to turn off the light.

314
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:24,097
You can turn off the light, Jackson.

315
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:24,930
- Yay!

316
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,585
(laughing)

317
00:11:27,585 --> 00:11:28,634
- [Mom] Now onto the show!

318
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:30,500
- [Dad] Onto the show!

319
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,260
Aww, look at Calvin all
cuddled up with you.

320
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,289
- Are you still falling asleep?

321
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:35,710
Hope so.

322
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,418
- What a wonderful day
we have spent together

323
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:38,998
as a family.

324
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:40,963
It is late at night and this little guy

325
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:43,783
woke up, he looks cranky but he's actually

326
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:45,266
been pretty smiley.

327
00:11:45,266 --> 00:11:47,039
He woke up and came
into my office to be my

328
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,715
little buddy as I'm editing.

329
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,771
Oh and now he wants to leave, bye!

330
00:11:50,771 --> 00:11:52,910
And that's where I'm
going to leave you guys.

331
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,679
Thank you so much for
watching the video today

332
00:11:54,679 --> 00:00:00,000
and I will see you guys tomorrow, bye!
