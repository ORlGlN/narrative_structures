00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,904
- Good morning guys, I'm
sitting here in my office

2
00:00:01,904 --> 00:00:04,225
getting some work done,
getting some videos edited

3
00:00:04,225 --> 00:00:06,592
and while I was trying to
edit one of the videos,

4
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:09,629
I couldn't find one of the
SD cards that I needed,

5
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:11,127
'cause we filmed on two different cameras

6
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:12,040
one of these days.

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,471
And I was looking all over the place

8
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,646
for this SD card.

9
00:00:15,646 --> 00:00:17,006
It wasn't in the camera,

10
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:18,422
it wasn't in this camera,

11
00:00:18,422 --> 00:00:19,989
it wasn't in my computer

12
00:00:19,989 --> 00:00:21,001
and I was scrambling around,

13
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:23,063
like where the heck is this SD card?

14
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:24,223
I'm looking in the kitchen,

15
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:26,259
my bedroom, everywhere
we would normally have

16
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,656
an SD card when it's
outside of the camera,

17
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,440
next to my laptops.

18
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,002
Lo and behold, I found it in
the weirdest place possible.

19
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,137
And I have no idea how it got there.

20
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:38,440
Let me show it where it is

21
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,461
and tell me if you think
this is kinda crazy.

22
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:43,783
We have this little post-it notepad thing

23
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:46,949
and there's one page, two page,

24
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,320
oh my goodness, underneath the glass,

25
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,856
there is the SD card.

26
00:00:52,856 --> 00:00:55,072
And I have to think, one of the kids

27
00:00:55,072 --> 00:00:57,056
somehow got the SD card,

28
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,289
came into my office and
was just messing around.

29
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:01,043
Everything else is kind of in its place,

30
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:02,795
nothing's really moved around,

31
00:01:02,795 --> 00:01:04,980
but that SD card somehow,

32
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,805
got slipped in there, and
that is the craziest thing.

33
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:09,236
I am so glad I found it.

34
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,293
So you have this video today.

35
00:01:11,293 --> 00:01:12,126
- So as I'm getting ready for the day,

36
00:01:12,126 --> 00:01:13,976
I wanted to show you guys the lipstick

37
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:15,472
that I've been wearing the last few days.

38
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:16,305
I've had a lot of--

39
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:17,336
Oh it's dark.

40
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:19,320
You guys have asked me the last few vlogs,

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,719
of what I've been wearing.

42
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:23,547
And it's new to me, it's a NARS lipstick

43
00:01:23,547 --> 00:01:26,919
and it's like a lip
gloss that turns matte,

44
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:27,752
so I guess not lipstick.

45
00:01:27,752 --> 00:01:29,722
It's a lip gloss, and
then when you apply it,

46
00:01:29,722 --> 00:01:30,555
it turns matte.

47
00:01:30,555 --> 00:01:32,370
I'm trying to see if there's
like a good name for it.

48
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,203
But this is, oh my--

49
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,036
(signal tone)

50
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:35,248
And it's lasted me all day.

51
00:01:35,248 --> 00:01:37,342
I kiss my kids, I love it.

52
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:39,678
The shade I'm wearing is power matte,

53
00:01:39,678 --> 00:01:41,614
American woman, is what I'm wearing.

54
00:01:41,614 --> 00:01:43,710
I've had a lot of people ask what it is,

55
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,335
so hopefully, this will
answer your questions.

56
00:01:46,335 --> 00:01:49,326
I don't think I've ever
owned a NARS lipstick.

57
00:01:49,326 --> 00:01:52,346
I like Revlon, I like, what else,

58
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,428
I have a lot of Smashbox and

59
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,146
yeah, I don't think I've
ever owned a NARS one.

60
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:58,098
But I would love to get a red one,

61
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,981
because they really do last all day.

62
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:03,237
And I used to wear LipSense quite a bit.

63
00:02:03,237 --> 00:02:06,237
(atmospheric music)

64
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:08,859
And then it'll dry.

65
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,073
I used to wear LipSense quite a bit,

66
00:02:11,073 --> 00:02:12,187
and I still have it.

67
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:13,858
A lot of people have asked me,

68
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:16,112
I've gone back and forth, I've like it,

69
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:18,016
I haven't liked it.

70
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:21,432
And I'll use it once in awhile.

71
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:23,672
I tried it for two months straight

72
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:24,794
of using it every day,

73
00:02:24,794 --> 00:02:26,419
because that lipstick is the type

74
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:28,235
where you have to wear it

75
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,426
and you can't switch
between other products,

76
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,064
which I don't love,
because it's always fun

77
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,815
to try other products
and to wear other stuff,

78
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:36,618
so that's the one thing
I don't like about it,

79
00:02:36,618 --> 00:02:39,331
is you're kind of stuck
to that one product.

80
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,100
And I don't like anyone to tell me

81
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,143
what I can and can't
wear with my make-up so.

82
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:44,141
(laughs)

83
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:46,468
There we go, ready for the day.

84
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:49,235
See, it's been on for
like two seconds now.

85
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,533
And it won't transfer on my teeth now.

86
00:02:52,533 --> 00:02:53,513
Oh it will.

87
00:02:53,513 --> 00:02:55,077
(laughs)

88
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:57,820
It will, but it does dry

89
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,429
and I do kiss the kids and it doesn't seem

90
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,116
to wear off, that was funny.

91
00:03:01,116 --> 00:03:02,733
- You also kiss me too sometimes.

92
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,946
- Yeah, sometimes.
- If I've been good.

93
00:03:04,946 --> 00:03:05,779
(laughing)

94
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,430
- [Ellie] Hi Calvin, are you doing okay?

95
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,349
You were really sad when
Jackson went to school.

96
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,411
- He was so sad, that
he wanted a wed straw.

97
00:03:13,411 --> 00:03:14,244
- [Ellie] A red straw?

98
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:15,077
- Yeah.

99
00:03:15,077 --> 00:03:16,373
A wed straw?
- A wed straw.

100
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:18,769
- Did you get a wed straw?

101
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,406
Let me see it, is it red?

102
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:21,444
- Yeah.

103
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:22,371
- [Ellie] Say red.

104
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:23,239
- Red.

105
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,215
- Red.

106
00:03:24,215 --> 00:03:25,959
You cutie patootie.

107
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:26,983
Curly hair.

108
00:03:26,983 --> 00:03:28,341
(laughing)

109
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,912
(bright music)

110
00:03:30,912 --> 00:03:33,535
- Oh! (laughing)

111
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:34,452
Here we go.

112
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,850
(laughing)

113
00:03:39,683 --> 00:03:41,235
Was that fun?

114
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:42,068
- Again.
- Yeah.

115
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:43,151
- Again?
- Yeah.

116
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,234
- Okay, one two three go.

117
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,714
(laughing)

118
00:03:47,714 --> 00:03:48,547
Again?

119
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:49,380
- Yeah!

120
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,728
- Okay.

121
00:03:50,728 --> 00:03:52,866
One two three hup.

122
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,662
(laughing)

123
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:56,245
One two three, hup.

124
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,595
(Calvin laughing)

125
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:02,981
Okay ready?
- Yeah.

126
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:03,814
- One,

127
00:04:03,814 --> 00:04:05,522
(laughing)

128
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:06,355
one, hup.

129
00:04:07,973 --> 00:04:10,195
That was a high one.

130
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:12,778
(bright music)

131
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,647
That was a high one.

132
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:20,386
High, you want to do high again?

133
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,219
- Yeah.

134
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,886
- One two three hup.

135
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:25,092
(laughing)

136
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:25,925
- High!

137
00:04:25,925 --> 00:04:27,018
- High?

138
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,092
- [Jackson] Ta-da!

139
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:30,560
- Jackson, how hi bud.
- Hi!

140
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,778
How are ya?

141
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:33,201
You scared me.

142
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:34,621
How was school?

143
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,538
- Good.
- Good.

144
00:04:35,538 --> 00:04:37,017
- Do you want to go high?

145
00:04:37,017 --> 00:04:38,433
One two three hup.

146
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:41,162
(laughing)

147
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:43,745
(bright music)

148
00:04:48,198 --> 00:04:49,166
Come over here.

149
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:49,999
- [Ellie] What?

150
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,341
- Come over here, come over here.

151
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,195
Come over here.
- What?

152
00:04:52,195 --> 00:04:53,736
- Stand right here, stand right here.

153
00:04:53,736 --> 00:04:54,721
Okay, boys are you ready?

154
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:55,554
- Yeah.
- Okay.

155
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:59,185
- One two three (laughing).

156
00:04:59,185 --> 00:05:01,518
One two three oopsie daisie.

157
00:05:02,673 --> 00:05:04,756
One two three super high.

158
00:05:08,046 --> 00:05:09,345
You want to go super high?

159
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:10,444
- Yeah.

160
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:11,702
- Okay.

161
00:05:11,702 --> 00:05:13,679
One two three hup.

162
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:15,403
(laughing)

163
00:05:15,403 --> 00:05:18,098
Jackson, look at the op, turn around,

164
00:05:18,098 --> 00:05:19,520
oh look at your shoulder,
lookit, right here,

165
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,407
it's right here, it's right here,

166
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,663
it's on your shirt,
right there, right there,

167
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:25,007
right there, do you see it?

168
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:26,143
What is it?

169
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,976
- Rainbow.

170
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:27,809
- [Jared] It's a rainbow.

171
00:05:27,809 --> 00:05:29,177
Do you see a rainbow?

172
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,457
Now it's on your forehead.

173
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,941
Now it's on your hoodie.

174
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,110
It's on your arm.

175
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,191
There's that red, oh where'd it go?

176
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,446
Do you know why that happens?

177
00:05:37,446 --> 00:05:38,279
- Yeah.

178
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,770
- [Jared] Tell me.

179
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,658
Yeah.

180
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,202
So what happens is there's
a light source out here,

181
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:44,677
and that light source comes

182
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,164
and goes through a prism,

183
00:05:46,164 --> 00:05:48,451
and this will act as a prism,

184
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,243
and when the light hits the prism,

185
00:05:50,243 --> 00:05:52,311
it breaks all the colors apart

186
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,561
into a rainbow.

187
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,031
Is that so cool?

188
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:56,864
- Yeah.

189
00:05:56,864 --> 00:05:59,197
- [Jared] Yeah, wait
children, before you go,

190
00:05:59,197 --> 00:06:02,446
come over here, I want to
show you another thing.

191
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,224
Look at all these rainbows.

192
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:05,057
(gasps)

193
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:05,890
- [Jackson] What?

194
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:06,723
Wow.

195
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:07,556
- [Jared] Is that so cool?

196
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:08,389
- Yeah.

197
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:09,222
- Yeah.

198
00:06:09,222 --> 00:06:12,080
Science is literally
happening in our living room.

199
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,247
Roygbiv, Red orange yellow

200
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:18,382
green blue violet.
- Look what I got?

201
00:06:18,382 --> 00:06:20,171
- Ta da dun.

202
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,451
- [Ellie] Where did you get that?

203
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,284
- At school.

204
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:24,005
- [Ellie] Why did you get it at school?

205
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:24,838
- Because.

206
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:26,002
- [Ellie] How did you earn it?

207
00:06:26,002 --> 00:06:27,879
- Because I got 10 gems.

208
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:28,712
- [Ellie] 10 gems.

209
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:30,525
How does a teacher give you a gem,

210
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,213
is it because you're good or do you clean,

211
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:35,685
what do you do to earn a gem?

212
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:36,605
- Be nice.

213
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,245
- [Ellie] Be nice and
you earned 10 of them?

214
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,373
And then you got a prize?

215
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,250
And you picked that one, huh?

216
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,307
- This one, yeah.

217
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,730
- I'm so proud of you.

218
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,531
That's cool.

219
00:06:48,531 --> 00:06:52,306
Okay, well we are going to be building

220
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:54,057
a puzzle right now.
- A puzzle.

221
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:56,624
- Jackson loves puzzles, so,

222
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:01,038
usually at least once a
day, I need to wipe this up,

223
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:02,711
we build a puzzle together.

224
00:07:02,711 --> 00:07:04,798
- Now that we've had fun
playing in the bedroom,

225
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,318
throwing the kids onto
the bed and the pillows,

226
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:11,335
we've done a little puzzle
attempt by you and Jackson.

227
00:07:11,335 --> 00:07:12,292
- Jackson did awesome.

228
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,829
I really hardly did it.

229
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,498
- [Jared] Oh he did all of this?

230
00:07:15,498 --> 00:07:16,554
- Of course I helped,

231
00:07:16,554 --> 00:07:19,890
but he, like I put all the green together.

232
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,279
I said this looks like the Hulk.

233
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,534
- Aww, that's awesome.
- He did a lot of it.

234
00:07:22,534 --> 00:07:24,990
- But you could tell
he got a little tired.

235
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,823
And he was done.

236
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:27,798
- So now the kids are downstairs playing

237
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:29,063
and Ellie and I have decided to take

238
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,723
the next 10 or 15 minutes

239
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:32,171
and micro clean, okay?

240
00:07:32,171 --> 00:07:33,371
Just take a little bit of time,

241
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,980
use your Hello microphone.

242
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,567
Microphone, this is a walkie talkie.

243
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,791
- Hey Jared, how's your office been

244
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,280
since I cleaned it?

245
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,113
- Spick-and-span.

246
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:41,946
- [Ellie] No it hasn't.

247
00:07:41,946 --> 00:07:43,664
- Yes it has.

248
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,119
Okay let's go in there right now

249
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:46,903
and we'll do a comparison,

250
00:07:46,903 --> 00:07:48,775
compared to what it used to be,

251
00:07:48,775 --> 00:07:50,279
to what it is right now, okay?

252
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:54,071
- I really, I think it's
more funny than anything.

253
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,171
In here.

254
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:56,698
- [Jared] I'm gonna let you go in.

255
00:07:56,698 --> 00:07:58,034
- It's not bad.
- It's not bad

256
00:07:58,034 --> 00:08:00,338
- [Jared] is right, I got
a few things right here.

257
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:01,171
See?

258
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,212
Not too bad is it, mmm?

259
00:08:03,212 --> 00:08:04,159
(bright music)

260
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,742
(Jared laughs)

261
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,732
- The wall?

262
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:16,565
- Nope.

263
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,297
We're eating apples.

264
00:08:19,297 --> 00:08:22,297
I don't know why we're on the floor.

265
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,917
- [Jackson] The ceiling.

266
00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,243
The ceiling.

267
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:29,753
- The ceiling?

268
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:32,794
No, what else is white around here?

269
00:08:32,794 --> 00:08:35,892
Look around on the floor maybe.

270
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:36,725
- No.

271
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:38,816
That's brown.

272
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:41,317
- [Ellie] No look next to you.

273
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:43,836
- What?

274
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:44,754
What is it?

275
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:46,819
- [Ellie] Look on the ground,

276
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,491
what's on the ground around here?

277
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:50,195
That's white.

278
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:51,028
Not that.

279
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,623
What?

280
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:54,492
- Santa's hat.

281
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,834
- [Ellie] Yes.

282
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:56,685
- My turn.
- Okay.

283
00:08:56,685 --> 00:09:00,185
- I spy with my little eye something blue.

284
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:04,516
- [Ellie] Something blue?

285
00:09:04,516 --> 00:09:05,444
Is it the rug?

286
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,715
- [Calvin] Apple.

287
00:09:06,715 --> 00:09:07,635
Apple.

288
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:08,641
(Ellie laughs)

289
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,112
- [Ellie] My apple.

290
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:12,695
Is it the painting on the wall?

291
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:15,084
- No.

292
00:09:15,084 --> 00:09:16,334
- [Ellie] Is it

293
00:09:17,962 --> 00:09:18,962
what's blue?

294
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:21,296
Is it the lamp?

295
00:09:21,296 --> 00:09:22,905
Yahoo!

296
00:09:22,905 --> 00:09:23,907
- You know what, there's just something

297
00:09:23,907 --> 00:09:25,930
about seeing you boys bundled up

298
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,959
in your winter clothes
that just makes me think

299
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,845
you are the cutest boys
I the whole dang world.

300
00:09:29,845 --> 00:09:30,678
You know that?

301
00:09:30,678 --> 00:09:31,832
Do you know that?

302
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:32,665
- Yeah.

303
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:34,132
- We're gonna go, you guys and me,

304
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:35,797
and Penny, we're gonna
go take her for a walk

305
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,621
in the mountains.

306
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:38,454
Do you want to go with me?

307
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,287
- Yeah!

308
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,654
- Okay, let's go get Penny

309
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:41,862
and let's go get in the car.

310
00:09:41,862 --> 00:09:43,166
And you take your finger out of your nose.

311
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:45,416
(laughing)

312
00:09:46,806 --> 00:09:47,792
Let's go.

313
00:09:47,792 --> 00:09:48,625
There's a little seat?

314
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,458
- Uh-huh.

315
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:50,291
- [Jared] Did you find a good spot?

316
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,124
- Yeah.

317
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,117
- [Jared] Good.

318
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:55,481
Well isn't that just a picture
perfect moment right there?

319
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,761
Oh perfect, now Penny's in it.

320
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,208
(Jared laughs)

321
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,225
You guys are just the cutest, huh?

322
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:02,058
- Yeah.

323
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:02,891
- [Jared] Are you guys having fun?

324
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:03,724
- Yeah.

325
00:10:03,724 --> 00:10:04,557
- [Jared] Good.

326
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:05,390
Yay!

327
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,243
- Stop.

328
00:10:06,243 --> 00:10:07,694
- [Jared] Stop.

329
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,380
What's the password?

330
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,213
- Hey!

331
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:12,103
- Oh he tricked you, he gypped you.

332
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,517
He gypped you.

333
00:10:13,517 --> 00:10:15,688
(Jared laughing)

334
00:10:15,688 --> 00:10:17,197
So we're on a little date night, you know?

335
00:10:17,197 --> 00:10:18,537
- I love date night.

336
00:10:18,537 --> 00:10:19,646
- It's just a little date date.

337
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:22,134
So the past three or four years,

338
00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:23,701
I feel terrible about this,

339
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:27,775
but TJ has a play called Juanito Bandito

340
00:10:27,775 --> 00:10:31,135
and it's locally famous
I think throughout Utah,

341
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:33,302
but especially northern Utah

342
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:35,154
and every Christmas they have a play

343
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:37,233
and every year they've invited us to come

344
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:40,154
and every year, we've had something else

345
00:10:40,154 --> 00:10:41,889
interfere with the play.

346
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:43,369
But not this year.

347
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:45,002
This year is not that year

348
00:10:45,002 --> 00:10:46,341
and we are going to the play today.

349
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:47,346
They've invited us to come

350
00:10:47,346 --> 00:10:49,830
and a bunch of other
YouTubers are here too.

351
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,069
And we are gonna go see Juanito Bandito,

352
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,064
which is this hilarious comedy play

353
00:10:55,064 --> 00:10:58,069
that TJ puts on every single year.

354
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,166
Say hi TJ.

355
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

356
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,818
- [Jared] Hey we'll see
you in the show man,

357
00:11:01,818 --> 00:11:02,663
good luck, break a leg.

358
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,188
- We love the Mecham family.
- Sorry.

359
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:05,021
- [Jared] Oh thanks man, thank you.

360
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:05,854
- Yeah don't strangle it,

361
00:11:05,854 --> 00:11:06,762
I'm not down with that.

362
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:07,595
- [Jared] Okay.

363
00:11:07,595 --> 00:11:09,648
- Jared just hugged me

364
00:11:09,648 --> 00:11:11,926
and he goes, I'll be right back.

365
00:11:11,926 --> 00:11:13,359
- [Jared] I had my hand right here.

366
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:16,429
- And he goes, oh you have love handles.

367
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,837
- [Jared] I was like,
what, there's love handles.

368
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:20,430
(laughing)

369
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,263
- I was like thanks, I'm pregnant.

370
00:11:26,448 --> 00:11:29,906
He just hugged me, he goes
you have love handles, woo.

371
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,402
- I've got something to grab onto.

372
00:11:31,402 --> 00:11:34,038
- Every kid has fallen on this.

373
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:35,470
I feel so bad.

374
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,441
There's been like five that have tripped.

375
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:39,565
He's okay, his dad just picked him up.

376
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,420
Okay, see you in a sec.

377
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,492
- Alright guys circle
up, circle up, circle up.

378
00:11:43,492 --> 00:11:44,325
- Why?

379
00:11:44,325 --> 00:11:46,895
- In my hand, I have four pieces of gum,

380
00:11:46,895 --> 00:11:49,099
but don't you announce it,
(Bonnie loud breathing)

381
00:11:49,099 --> 00:11:52,243
because as soon as someone
knows that you have gum--

382
00:11:52,243 --> 00:11:54,493
(laughing)

383
00:11:56,328 --> 00:11:57,568
(coughing)

384
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:58,401
- [Joel] Give her all four.

385
00:11:58,401 --> 00:11:59,574
- I love Bonnie, but not that much.

386
00:11:59,574 --> 00:12:01,780
- As soon as someone knows you have gum,

387
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,947
you're the gum guy.

388
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,016
And everyone's coming
to you, asking for gum.

389
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,758
- Put your hand out before it's gone.

390
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:09,404
- Did you just give
Olivia one, she's a child,

391
00:12:09,404 --> 00:12:10,767
she doesn't need it.
- We'll go halfsies okay?

392
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,175
- No no Olivia, you gotta go halfsies.

393
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:14,508
Olivia halfsies!

394
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:17,729
We went halfsies.
(Olivia laughing)

395
00:12:17,729 --> 00:12:18,843
I like a half piece of gum.

396
00:12:18,843 --> 00:12:20,232
Oh see I told you.

397
00:12:20,232 --> 00:12:22,011
I told you, I told you.

398
00:12:22,011 --> 00:12:22,844
Put it away.

399
00:12:22,844 --> 00:12:26,153
Everyone put it in your mouth.

400
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,708
Shhh, everyone be quiet,
the play's starting.

401
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,483
(laughing)

402
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:31,091
- It is not, but I wish, oh it is,

403
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:32,739
the lights are going down,

404
00:12:32,739 --> 00:12:34,156
oh crap, oh shhh.

405
00:12:35,024 --> 00:12:36,999
I wanted to show how beautiful it was.

406
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,037
- [Jared] Well they
already saw my mustache,

407
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,678
they should know.

408
00:12:39,678 --> 00:12:42,845
♪ Don't die Christmas ♪

409
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,796
♪ I love it ♪

410
00:12:46,796 --> 00:12:50,963
- So he tells you he doesn't
want to do a-caroling?

411
00:12:51,962 --> 00:12:53,903
This is a liar.

412
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:54,736
- Wa ah!

413
00:12:56,589 --> 00:12:57,814
Oh!

414
00:12:57,814 --> 00:12:59,601
- It's freezing.

415
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,434
- It's so cold.

416
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:02,612
- In Utah, what's the degrees outside.

417
00:13:02,612 --> 00:13:03,590
- Oh there's no way that's right,

418
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,543
it says 31, it's way colder than that.

419
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:07,652
I got your seat heaters on.

420
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:09,411
- It says 20, it says 18 on my phone.

421
00:13:09,411 --> 00:13:10,673
- Okay 18, we're gonna go with 18.

422
00:13:10,673 --> 00:13:12,512
- That's about right, 18 degrees.

423
00:13:12,512 --> 00:13:14,657
Ah, that'll warm the fire up.

424
00:13:14,657 --> 00:13:16,469
(laughing)

425
00:13:16,469 --> 00:13:19,533
- Oh Ellie that's the worst.

426
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,533
Ellie Ellie,

427
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:24,152
you can't--

428
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,471
What do they call it?

429
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,762
- Covered wagon you!

430
00:13:26,762 --> 00:13:27,871
- Covered wagon me.

431
00:13:27,871 --> 00:13:30,798
You can't cover wagon me in my own car.

432
00:13:30,798 --> 00:13:31,956
(mock crying)

433
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:34,231
- So we met Juanito Bandito

434
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,023
actually at the doctors office,

435
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:38,462
him and his family were
going in for an ultrasound

436
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,295
and we met him,

437
00:13:39,295 --> 00:13:41,706
and we've been wanted
to see Juanito Bandito--

438
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:42,898
- [Jared] Juanito Bandito.

439
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:44,971
- We've been wanting
to see that for years.

440
00:13:44,971 --> 00:13:47,643
And it seems like every
time we go to do it,

441
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:50,830
it's the holidays, a
family party comes up,

442
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,846
one of us have a cold or whatnot,

443
00:13:52,846 --> 00:13:53,804
we have never been able to go.

444
00:13:53,804 --> 00:13:57,657
And this time, we went
and it was very funny

445
00:13:57,657 --> 00:14:00,128
and I liked hearing his story beforehand.

446
00:14:00,128 --> 00:14:02,211
He was gonna be a doctor.

447
00:14:03,057 --> 00:14:05,130
He went to medical school,

448
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:09,201
he decided after a year
like it wasn't for him

449
00:14:09,201 --> 00:14:11,489
and that's like a hard decision to make.

450
00:14:11,489 --> 00:14:13,739
And now he is running this,

451
00:14:14,806 --> 00:14:17,853
this show all year round
in different locations.

452
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:21,432
- He's in charge of this
Pickleville Playhouse

453
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:22,265
and they put on shows.

454
00:14:22,265 --> 00:14:25,498
And this is his dream and
that's what he loves to do.

455
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,524
- Didn't even realize that
that's what he was gonna do

456
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:29,623
and it's just I feel like lately,

457
00:14:29,623 --> 00:14:31,646
I've just been more and
more happy and proud

458
00:14:31,646 --> 00:14:34,823
of people doing what works for them,

459
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:36,902
being able to bring in an income.

460
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:39,294
My friend Jenny I'm so proud of her.

461
00:14:39,294 --> 00:14:41,764
I met her on YouTube years and years ago

462
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:44,036
and she started a jewelry company

463
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:46,711
and she runs it through her Instagram.

464
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,996
It's been able to support
her, I'm so proud of her.

465
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:51,483
We met Rad Swimwear tonight,

466
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:52,692
she does the same thing,

467
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:54,593
she sells swimming suits in Utah.

468
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:57,737
And I've fallen in love with her.

469
00:14:57,737 --> 00:15:00,064
She's a kind person.

470
00:15:00,064 --> 00:15:01,791
And it's just been so fun to meet

471
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,718
so many different people do
so many different things,

472
00:15:04,718 --> 00:15:06,415
and then here we are,

473
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:07,390
doing what we love,

474
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,086
and it's just really exciting

475
00:15:10,086 --> 00:15:12,574
and I hope that everyone feels that way,

476
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:14,621
no matter what job you have, you know?

477
00:15:14,621 --> 00:15:16,759
Whether you are a doctor or an engineer

478
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:18,989
or whether you work out of your home,

479
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,438
it's just really cool to see

480
00:15:21,438 --> 00:15:23,638
and it was really cool to go tonight

481
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:24,622
and we loved it.

482
00:15:24,622 --> 00:15:26,091
We loved the company we were with,

483
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,963
so many of our friends were there,

484
00:15:27,963 --> 00:15:29,509
and it's late.

485
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:30,619
We're gonna go home and go to bed.

486
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:32,803
We have a really fun day tomorrow.

487
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:33,636
- [Jared] Woo hoo!

488
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:34,736
- I think everyone feels this way,

489
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,410
like a few weeks before Christmas,

490
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:37,650
like you want to do fun stuff,

491
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,761
but it's work work work,

492
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:39,746
you're busy, you're crazy,

493
00:15:39,746 --> 00:15:43,049
and this next week is gonna be

494
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:46,634
a huge week with watching
all the IVF videos

495
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:47,993
and then the week of Christmas,

496
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:51,225
it's like vacation mode, you know?

497
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:53,872
So, tomorrow though, we are
taking a break tomorrow,

498
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:56,465
because we are doing
something very very special.

499
00:15:56,465 --> 00:15:59,523
- Oh but there will be
a video, just you wait.

500
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:00,862
It's a very special video.
- Yes yes.

501
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:03,231
- So thank you guys so much for watching.

502
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:05,891
And we'll see you tomorrow.

503
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:07,075
Bye.

504
00:16:07,075 --> 00:00:00,000
(announcement music)
