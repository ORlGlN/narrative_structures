1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,836
- [Ellie] Morning, Mr. Jackson.

2
00:00:01,836 --> 00:00:03,628
(lively music)
Morning, Miss Penny.

3
00:00:03,628 --> 00:00:05,690
- Now I can talk.

4
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:06,523
- [Ellie] Now you can talk?

5
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:07,356
Oh, cause you were eating?

6
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:10,060
Jackson, last night you slept

7
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,870
with Calvin, how was it?

8
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,470
- It was good.

9
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,345
- [Ellie] Did you sleep all night?

10
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:16,346
- Mhm.

11
00:00:16,346 --> 00:00:17,375
- [Ellie] And he slept all night?

12
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,208
- Mhmm.

13
00:00:18,208 --> 00:00:19,190
- [Ellie] Wow.
- He got out.

14
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,470
- He got out?

15
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,638
You know, the kids actually
did really well last night,

16
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:26,321
they woke up once and
both of them were crying,

17
00:00:26,321 --> 00:00:29,010
and Jared went downstairs
and told them both,

18
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:30,330
he goes, "Lay down,"

19
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,409
and then walked out, and they did great.

20
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,080
But they did wake up
early, they woke up at six.

21
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,559
That's not too bad though,
they slept through the night

22
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,490
and I am so proud of them,

23
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,350
and they had fun,

24
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,690
and then they've been playing all morning.

25
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,320
So, last night, I would
say, was a success.

26
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,094
You know how it took me forever to get the

27
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:48,720
Christmas decorations?

28
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,586
Well, it's taking me
forever to get them down,

29
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:53,080
and I'm okay with that.

30
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,650
I guess one day at a time, right?

31
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,550
Like, one thing put away a day,

32
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,210
so by the, by February first
everything will be put away.

33
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,043
That's my goal.

34
00:01:01,043 --> 00:01:02,150
Penny, girl.

35
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,000
Penny (chuckles).

36
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,370
I went in the bathroom, I was like,

37
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,210
Jared, is Penny in here?

38
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:08,600
He's like, "How'd you lose her?"

39
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,680
I literally was like,

40
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,170
I lost her, like,

41
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,210
with Penny, she's still a puppy

42
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,367
and we definitely do not trust her

43
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,367
just to wander the house

44
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,610
if we're not by her.

45
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,639
She will chew up
something, like (chuckles),

46
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,690
she's still just a puppy, so.

47
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:27,440
I was like, where did she go?

48
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,405
I went in there, I was looking for her,

49
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:30,960
and then I came out and she
was just sitting by the stairs

50
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,560
watching Jackson come up.

51
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,220
She disappeared from me.

52
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,520
Crazy, huh?

53
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,230
Miss Penny trying to trick me.

54
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,940
Trying to trick me,

55
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,930
you little stinker.

56
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,270
You were quiet and sneaky,

57
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,190
you were probably behind
the Christmas tree.

58
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,130
Trying to break some bulbs, huh? (laughs)

59
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,440
Belly scratch time (laughs).

60
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,150
Belly scratch time.

61
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:56,987
(laughs)

62
00:01:56,987 --> 00:01:58,110
- What is this?

63
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,560
- [Ellie] That is her nipple.

64
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,480
You know how mommy breastfeeds?

65
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,520
That's how Penny will
breastfeed if she has babies.

66
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,758
- Hey, belly scratch time.

67
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:13,630
(laughter)

68
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,788
- [Ellie] She thought it was
time to scratch your belly.

69
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:17,871
(laughs)

70
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:20,767
- Scratchin' her belly time.

71
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,035
♪ Scratching her belly time ♪

72
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,880
♪ Penny loves belly scratches ♪

73
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,390
We're getting the snow back,

74
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,380
snow is coming like crazy.

75
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,220
Ellie just went to go get some groceries

76
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,170
from the grocery store and she said

77
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:36,527
the roads are so slick,
which is super disappointing

78
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:39,630
because I had some fun
plans that I wanted to do

79
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,430
with Ellie and the boys today,

80
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,940
and we'd have to drive through
the canyon to get there,

81
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,750
and I just don't think
it's as smart to do that

82
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,200
because we kinda have to hustle,

83
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,070
and hustling in the snow
is not what you wanna do.

84
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,000
But, this is very good for skiing,

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,610
because I think Jackson and I,

86
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,400
his birthday is next week,

87
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,960
I think we're gonna try and
go skiing early in the morning

88
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,380
on his birthday.

89
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,900
We'll see about that.

90
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,564
So, snow, I love the
snow, but I hate snow.

91
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,900
You're giving me more
plans for the future,

92
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,160
but you're taking away
from my plans right now.

93
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,670
This is a very big conflict right now,

94
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,200
and I don't know which side of the fence

95
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,420
I want to be on.

96
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,780
Oh, what a strong boy--
- I'm coming.

97
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,797
- [Jared] Are you helping
mom get up the stairs?

98
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,268
- I'm coming.

99
00:03:24,268 --> 00:03:25,757
- [Jared] (chuckles)

100
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:26,908
- We're not really going anywhere.

101
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,864
You want me to hold you,
while you're (laughter).

102
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:33,031
Who's holding who? (laughter)

103
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:36,694
- [Jared] Do you wanna go up?

104
00:03:36,694 --> 00:03:38,700
- I'm getting there, I'm gonna go slow.

105
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,230
- Grab mom's hand.

106
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,620
- We just put away
Christmas and now I'm like--

107
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,090
- Yeah.

108
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,537
All of the trees are finally gone.

109
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,570
I had to show you this,

110
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:50,650
because I am so dang stinking proud of us

111
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,160
for this organization.

112
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,370
Like, it is ridiculous.

113
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,780
You should have seen
what it was like before,

114
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,650
in fact, I'm kind of upset

115
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,422
that we don't have a before,

116
00:03:58,422 --> 00:04:00,620
but this room was a disaster.

117
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,810
Like, I'm talking everything
was just filled up to here.

118
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,650
But look at what it looks like now.

119
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,080
We organized the crap out of this room.

120
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,130
Like, look.

121
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,140
This is all Christmas right here,

122
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,050
and it's all neat and organized,

123
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,640
and this is all Halloween right here.

124
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,336
All of our costumes and
decorations that we have.

125
00:04:21,336 --> 00:04:23,330
We really, really did a great job,

126
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,450
and I'm proud of myself,

127
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,550
and I'm not trying to be like,

128
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,114
big headed or anything, I'm
just proud because it was a mess

129
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:31,440
and it was a disaster
and now it looks great.

130
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,660
When we were in St. George,

131
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,960
I was taking a picture of
myself, just as a joke,

132
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,030
and Carl and Ginger took a picture of me

133
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,350
taking a picture,

134
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,130
and they said, I wonder
how long it will take

135
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,340
for Jared to notice.

136
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,130
And I was doing this face, I was going.

137
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,720
It was something like that,
I'll put the picture in here,

138
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,070
and so many people thought
that I looked like Jim Carey

139
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,830
and I was like, oh, that's so funny.

140
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,463
But they said, you look like
Jim Carey as The Grinch.

141
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,702
(laughter) So Ellie--

142
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:02,950
- Hey, I've always told you
that I thought, in a way,

143
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,609
he reminds me of The Grinch.

144
00:05:05,609 --> 00:05:08,026
- And it's because of my bum.

145
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,620
I guess I have skinny legs and a bum,

146
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,330
and I look like The Grinch

147
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,190
- From behind, like the first time

148
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,628
Jared and I saw each other, I was like,

149
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,265
you look like The Grinch!

150
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,430
- [Jared] Yeah.
- And it was so funny,

151
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,933
and people might think that's really mean.

152
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:24,766
Do you think that's mean?

153
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:26,568
I thought it was really cute.

154
00:05:26,568 --> 00:05:28,220
- I don't know, I think
it's a little interesting,

155
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,500
a little weird--

156
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,095
- Well, and this.

157
00:05:31,095 --> 00:05:33,727
The Meekum nose, like this of the Meekums.

158
00:05:33,727 --> 00:05:34,560
- [Jared] Yeah.

159
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,027
- Their nose and their mouth.

160
00:05:36,027 --> 00:05:36,900
- [Jared] Uh-huh.

161
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,365
- Remind me of the Whos a little.

162
00:05:38,365 --> 00:05:39,280
- [Jared] (laughs)
- It's cute!

163
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,830
It's cute!

164
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,680
- I'm a grinch, I'm a Who from Whoville.

165
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,740
I don't know, but it's
funny, just the way,

166
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,430
and, because I love Jim Carey,

167
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,440
Jim Carey is one of my
favorite actors of all time,

168
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,792
but his face, just the
whole Grinch face, the.

169
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,880
I don't know, I don't know, I can't do it,

170
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,236
but I thought that was funny.

171
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,180
- [Ellie] Okay, I'm
gonna turn the vacuum on.

172
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,370
- We're vacuuming everything up.

173
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,940
I like, it feels like something's missing,

174
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,490
like the Christmas tree is gone,

175
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,130
but this is out house now.

176
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,076
- [Ellie] I love it.

177
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,840
I know I Instagrammed it, but
I don't know if I vlogged it.

178
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,970
Jackson is wearing Calvin's
pants today (chuckles).

179
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,950
That was so silly.

180
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,190
Okay, hold this over here.

181
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,890
- [Jackson] Okay.
- [Ellie] I'm gonna pour

182
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:20,910
some more on there.

183
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,410
Okay, pour that in.

184
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,590
Perfect.

185
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:30,070
I'm trying another recipe
in the Instant Pot, guys.

186
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,047
We're gonna see how it turns out.

187
00:06:32,047 --> 00:06:32,880
- [Jackson] And salsa--

188
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,410
- [Ellie] Okay, dump that in.

189
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,500
- [Jackson] It's so heavy.

190
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,200
- I know, you're doing good.

191
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,780
I'm getting ready to cook my soup,

192
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,840
I just found a recipe on Pinterest--

193
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,770
- [Jackson] What's a recipe?

194
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,020
- It tells you what to make.

195
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,509
So I just found a really good recipe.

196
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:50,670
(blaring harmonica)
There are some that are

197
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,130
not as simple, where it was like

198
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,900
freeze this the night
before, and I was like,

199
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,680
I ant something really easy.

200
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,867
Calvin, do not eat his hair.

201
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,073
So I found this recipe,

202
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:01,960
it is Lentil Tortilla Soup.

203
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,720
It's a cup of diced onion, a bell pepper,

204
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,700
jalapeno if you want, I didn't do that,

205
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,430
two and a half cups chicken broth,

206
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,350
a can of tomato sauce,

207
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,502
half a cup of salsa, a
table spoon tomato paste,

208
00:07:12,502 --> 00:07:15,062
black beans, pinto beans, corn,

209
00:07:15,062 --> 00:07:17,925
dried lentils, chili
powder, garlic powder,

210
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:20,840
cumin, whatever other seasoning you want,

211
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,570
and then after you cook it
you just add some heavy cream

212
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,750
and then it's done.

213
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,260
I'm excited to try it, it's really easy,

214
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,300
you pretty much everything at home anyway,

215
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,200
except maybe a bell pepper and an onion,

216
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,530
which is what I just needed
to grab at the store today.

217
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,960
So I had everything.

218
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,060
I used all of out lentils.

219
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,966
I used to make tons of
lentil stuff in the summer

220
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:41,488
cause I would a lot of what
The Healthy Grocer Girl,

221
00:07:41,488 --> 00:07:43,330
what she would post.

222
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,110
She'd post tons of fun stuff like that,

223
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,110
and I just had stopped cooking lentils,

224
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,870
but that's what it called for.

225
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,320
So we're gonna see how long,

226
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,580
I don't even know how long
it goes for, let me look.

227
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,350
High pressure for 15 minutes,

228
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,476
walk away, freedom, and
then allow natural release,

229
00:07:58,476 --> 00:07:59,470
and then you're done.

230
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,910
So, 15 minutes.

231
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,890
That's it.

232
00:08:03,753 --> 00:08:05,412
(screams) Hope it's good.

233
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:06,245
- [Jared] (mumbles) will be!

234
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:07,706
- [Ellie] If it's not we're getting pizza!

235
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:08,539
- [Jared] Woo!

236
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:09,372
- It's gonna be good (laughs).

237
00:08:09,372 --> 00:08:12,070
Does anybody else just sit and stare?

238
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,160
I mean, how many of you
have an Instant Pot?

239
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,668
And how many of you like
it or don't like it?

240
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:19,264
I've been sitting here
the whole time (laughs)

241
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,220
just staring at it.

242
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,569
And the pressure just
released so I'm assuming

243
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,280
it's gonna be done soon.

244
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,770
I haven't used it enough to like

245
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,252
get to know it.

246
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:30,502
(whirring)

247
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:34,580
- There it is with cheese on top,

248
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,971
sour cream and avocado.

249
00:08:37,971 --> 00:08:40,610
We can dip chips in it if we want.

250
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,256
Come here you crazy.

251
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:44,193
(yelling child)

252
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:45,550
Hey!

253
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,960
Go get Jackson, say time to eat!

254
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,186
You blowing on it?

255
00:08:49,186 --> 00:08:50,860
- Yeah, it's hot.

256
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,190
- [Ellie] It's hot?

257
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,460
Thoughts, Mister?

258
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,410
Do you like it?

259
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:59,243
Did you eat just the chip or
did you eat the other food?

260
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:01,870
- I ate chip and more food.

261
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,730
- Okay (chuckles) let's
see you take another bite.

262
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,340
Calvin, I put chips in your soup.

263
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,382
Jackson likes it, let's
see what you think.

264
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's see what mom thinks.

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,471
Do you guys like this?

266
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:13,460
Do you like seeing what we make?

267
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,657
I enjoy vlogging dinner and what we make,

268
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,090
because I always want
to see what other people

269
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,210
are eating and making.

270
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,973
Thoughts?

271
00:09:21,973 --> 00:09:23,334
- Hot.

272
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:24,167
- It is hot.

273
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,000
Good girl, Penny.

274
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,773
- [Jared] It's good.

275
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:28,500
- She's been very good today.

276
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,953
Some days you're not, some
days you're like a toddler.

277
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:33,220
- [Jared] You like it?

278
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,480
- Literally, we have three toddlers.

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,640
Four now with little baby.

280
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:39,320
Mmm.

281
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,570
Mhmmm.
- Mhmmm.

282
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,360
- [Ellie] And mine's even
better because it has sour cream

283
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,888
and avocado and cheese in it.
- Mmmhmm.

284
00:09:46,888 --> 00:09:48,720
- I love it.

285
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,576
This is very, very good, guys.

286
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:53,190
Yay.

287
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,590
Thanks for my Instant pot.

288
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,450
- You're welcome.

289
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,290
- Seriously, not every
dinner goes this smooth.

290
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,830
Penny, you have been so good.

291
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:06,350
She's been good all day, like,
there are some days where

292
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,500
we are like, (screams).

293
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:10,410
(laughs)

294
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,430
Sometimes we don't film a lot with her

295
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,510
being around, because
it's like we're teaching

296
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,180
and training her, it's like so much work--

297
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,510
- Well, she knows when
we have the camera out,

298
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,350
she'll start--

299
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,980
- Oh, she get's--
- Hyper when the camera's out.

300
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,458
So we're treating her and rewarding her--

301
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,049
- [Ellie] For just being so good.

302
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:32,216
- She needs to learn that
it's okay do this kinda stuff.

303
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,660
- Like, the kids have been
playing and petting her,

304
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,330
I just took a bajillion
photos of Calvin and her,

305
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,020
and she's just been so
good, I'm so proud of her.

306
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,830
- She does not always need to be up,

307
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,540
like hyper, that's, it's okay
to just ake a chill pill.

308
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,373
- [Ellie] Yeah.

309
00:10:48,373 --> 00:10:49,454
- [Jared] And she's doing so good.

310
00:10:49,454 --> 00:10:50,552
(mumbling)

311
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:51,946
- [Ellie] She scoots off.

312
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,306
- Chill pill!

313
00:10:53,306 --> 00:10:54,610
- [Ellie] Yeah, chill pill (laughs).

314
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,650
- [Jared] Look at her
noble face, I love it.

315
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,740
- Because sometimes the kids
don't just go up and pet her

316
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,650
because she just won't let them,

317
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,900
cause she's just too busy.

318
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,570
But she's like, look, she
just backs up in her place.

319
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:06,830
Oh, Penny, I'm so proud of you girl.

320
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,520
You've been so nice with the kids.

321
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:16,702
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, that's cute.

322
00:11:16,702 --> 00:11:18,250
(laughs)

323
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,280
I love this.

324
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,510
I hope you guys enjoy this footage,

325
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,496
this is so, like, just us being at home.

326
00:11:25,496 --> 00:11:28,180
Like, Jared takes Penny on a walk everyday

327
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,760
and I'm like you should film that,

328
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,020
I almost get mad, I'm
like, why don't you film

329
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,910
how fun that is?

330
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,410
But he's like, well, it's just repetitive,

331
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,660
and I'm like, um, hello?

332
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,170
I show what I film everyday
for dinner, almost.

333
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,520
So you need to, okay?

334
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,973
- The kids went to bed
so much better tonight,

335
00:11:42,973 --> 00:11:45,340
I think they're gonna
sleep really, really great,

336
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,890
and I'm really excited about it.

337
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,580
They were excited to go to bed.

338
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,460
Hi, are you waiting for me again?

339
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,990
They were excited to go to bed,

340
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:54,100
and we, oo...
(popping)

341
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,000
are about to go ham

342
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,710
on some snacks.

343
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:59,927
Ellie and I are gonna watch a movie.

344
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,201
Oh, hot hot hot hot hot hot!

345
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,528
(clattering)
Oh, not in the sink.

346
00:12:02,528 --> 00:12:03,528
Shhh! Jared.

347
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,820
The babies are trying to sleep.

348
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,480
We're gonna go ham on some snacks

349
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,900
and have a wonderful Saturday night.

350
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,050
Today was an awesome day,

351
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,970
it turned out to be awesome,

352
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,790
but it wasn't starting out.

353
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,640
I had some fun plans for
the kids and for Ellie

354
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,900
that we have to postpone
but we will do them soon.

355
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,660
So, all in all, still
a good day even though

356
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,080
it didn't work out the way we wanted.

357
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,650
And that's the best kinda day, right?

358
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,230
Anyway, thanks so much for watching, guys,

359
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,330
if you enjoyed the video
give it a big thumbs up,

360
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,860
make sure you hit that subscribe button,

361
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,846
as well as the notification bell.

362
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,860
There's been things
going around saying that

363
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,570
YouTube only pushes certain
videos when you have

364
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,560
the subscribe button,

365
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,810
but when you have the bell
notification it tells you

366
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,410
every time we put out a video.

367
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,520
Kind of frustrating, I know,

368
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,360
we're still working with
YouTube about these things,

369
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,610
but...

370
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,540
Thank you for doing that.

371
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,093
We appreciate it.

372
00:12:52,093 --> 00:12:52,926
Thanks for sharing with
your friends and family,

373
00:12:52,926 --> 00:00:00,000
and we will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
