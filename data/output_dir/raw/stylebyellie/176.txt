1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,659
(jangly upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:03,714
- [Jared] We have made
a video every single day

3
00:00:03,714 --> 00:00:05,714
for 1,210 days straight.

4
00:00:12,482 --> 00:00:15,232
But we've never done this before.

5
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:17,761
Good morning guys.

6
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,657
We have to be so quiet.

7
00:00:19,657 --> 00:00:21,930
Ellie is still asleep.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,073
Bless her heart, thank goodness she gets

9
00:00:24,073 --> 00:00:25,729
to sleep in a little bit.

10
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:27,345
But I thought it would be nice

11
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:29,035
to have her wake up

12
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:31,569
to me making her a nice, warm bath

13
00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:33,319
to start off the day.

14
00:00:35,105 --> 00:00:37,772
(running water)

15
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,673
Good morning.

16
00:00:58,673 --> 00:00:59,506
(Jared laughs)

17
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:01,441
Hi sleepyhead.

18
00:01:01,441 --> 00:01:03,358
Will you do the honors?

19
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:06,427
- Yes.

20
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:07,260
We got two fidget spinners,

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,521
because duh, we wanted one.

22
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:11,238
And usually I'd sit in the tub and do it,

23
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,576
but this is a special one,

24
00:01:12,576 --> 00:01:14,326
we're gonna watch it.

25
00:01:16,617 --> 00:01:18,217
- [Jared] Oh.

26
00:01:18,217 --> 00:01:19,412
(game show fail music)

27
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,765
- [Ellie] I don't think
this is a bath bomb.

28
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:22,704
- [Jared] Do you put it under the tub?

29
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:23,584
- [Ellie] Yes, this is a

30
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,667
- [Jared] Bubble bar?

31
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,534
- [Ellie] Uh-huh.

32
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:27,158
- [Jared] I'm sorry, I just ruined it.

33
00:01:27,158 --> 00:01:28,249
- [Ellie] That was a Lush fail.

34
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:30,650
I never had a Lush fail.

35
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,944
There we go.

36
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:33,911
(running water)

37
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:38,289
- [Jared] You got to hold
it like a fidget spinner.

38
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,311
- That's kind of a fail, but that's okay.

39
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:41,554
(sighs)

40
00:01:41,554 --> 00:01:43,193
- Today's a big day, Ellie.

41
00:01:43,193 --> 00:01:44,026
Are you ready?

42
00:01:44,026 --> 00:01:45,793
- Yes, are you?

43
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:46,649
- I think I'm ready.

44
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:49,732
(sweet guitar music)

45
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:17,862
- Oooh, hi.

46
00:02:20,436 --> 00:02:21,350
(kisses)

47
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,426
Hi.

48
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:23,815
(laughing)

49
00:02:23,815 --> 00:02:24,815
How are you?

50
00:02:26,336 --> 00:02:28,419
(kisses)

51
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,321
- Boo!

52
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:31,618
(yelling)

53
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,221
- [Jared] Hi bud.

54
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,449
Hi.
- Come here.

55
00:02:34,449 --> 00:02:35,847
- How are you?
- Did you bring me a present?

56
00:02:35,847 --> 00:02:38,114
- I did, I brought you something little.

57
00:02:38,114 --> 00:02:40,478
Did you poo poo in the toilet?

58
00:02:40,478 --> 00:02:41,424
- No, Calvin did.

59
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,784
- Calvin did, that's so cool.

60
00:02:42,784 --> 00:02:44,925
Did you poop in the toilet?

61
00:02:44,925 --> 00:02:45,758
- Mmm-mmm.

62
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:47,453
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness.

63
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:49,522
- He pooped a little nibble.

64
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:50,625
(laughing)

65
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,968
- You didn't take a
nibble though, did you?

66
00:02:52,968 --> 00:02:54,595
- That's fun.

67
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:56,443
We got you that one.

68
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:58,663
What is it Calvin?

69
00:02:58,663 --> 00:02:59,580
What is it?

70
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:04,441
- What is it, a fidget spinner?

71
00:03:04,441 --> 00:03:07,767
- That is a bath bomb fidget spinner.

72
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,095
- What?

73
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:10,568
- Is that cool?

74
00:03:10,568 --> 00:03:12,963
- [Jared] What do you see?

75
00:03:12,963 --> 00:03:13,796
- A bomby.
- Do you have any toys?

76
00:03:13,796 --> 00:03:14,629
- [Jared] A bomby?

77
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:15,848
- I don't have any toys.

78
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:16,681
(laughing)

79
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:20,356
But we brought you a bath
bomb fidget spinner, okay?

80
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,713
- [Jared] Is that so cool?

81
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:22,546
- Yes.

82
00:03:22,546 --> 00:03:23,563
- [Jared] What do you say to Mommy?

83
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,130
- Thanks Mom, what are these?

84
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:25,963
- You're welcome.

85
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,399
And we just got you some winter clothes.

86
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,213
You wanna see 'em?
- Yay!

87
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:32,263
- We made it back just in time for dinner.

88
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:35,895
We are making the yummy
Hello Fresh tonight.

89
00:03:35,895 --> 00:03:38,656
You guys know how much I
absolutely love Hello Fresh,

90
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:41,635
but we are actually going
to do a little flashback

91
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:42,531
video for you.

92
00:03:42,531 --> 00:03:43,665
Thank you so much Hello Fresh

93
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,598
for sponsoring our video today.

94
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,705
- We just got home from our drive,

95
00:03:47,705 --> 00:03:48,624
from the plane ride

96
00:03:48,624 --> 00:03:49,497
and from California,

97
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:52,458
it was awesome, but our bellies are empty.

98
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,561
And luckily, I just opened the fridge,

99
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:57,842
we have one last Hello Fresh left.

100
00:03:57,842 --> 00:04:00,809
Thank goodness because Ellie is starving,

101
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:03,274
the kids are starving and I'm starving.

102
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,161
You guys know that we love Hello Fresh,

103
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,871
for those of you who don't know about it,

104
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,536
it's a meal kit delivery service,

105
00:04:08,536 --> 00:04:10,288
where they deliver food to your house

106
00:04:10,288 --> 00:04:12,015
every single week,

107
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:15,639
in pre-portioned packages, all set,

108
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,324
ready to go and that's a huge part

109
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,156
of why I like it,

110
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,208
because it makes it easy for me to cook.

111
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:22,331
I help a little bit around the house more,

112
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,738
and it's like 30 minutes
around there to make a meal.

113
00:04:25,738 --> 00:04:28,481
So it's quick, healthy and it's delicious.

114
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:32,112
(groovy bright music)

115
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:34,695
All the ingredients right here.

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,385
Today we are making chicken

117
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:40,938
under a zucchini blanket.

118
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:42,137
It sounds delicious.

119
00:04:42,137 --> 00:04:44,097
Each meal has a recipe card

120
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:45,945
that is super easy to follow

121
00:04:45,945 --> 00:04:47,192
and each of the meals come

122
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,082
with a recyclable insulated box

123
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:50,073
delivered right to your doorstep

124
00:04:50,073 --> 00:04:54,073
and each of the meals are
less than $10 dollars.

125
00:04:56,918 --> 00:04:59,001
Alright, there is dinner.

126
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,670
I think it looks delicious.

127
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,320
I have really enjoyed having Hello Fresh

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,128
around the house for months now,

129
00:05:06,128 --> 00:05:07,762
because it gives me something to do

130
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:10,505
that's easy, quick and it's delicious.

131
00:05:10,505 --> 00:05:11,835
If you would like to join us

132
00:05:11,835 --> 00:05:14,098
and I know a lot of you guys already have,

133
00:05:14,098 --> 00:05:15,979
I'll have a link in the
description down below.

134
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:18,604
Use the promo code, ellieandjared30

135
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:21,612

136
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,879
Like I said, I'll have
a link and everything

137
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,396
in the description down below.

138
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:25,800
And we want to thank Hello Fresh

139
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,076
for being today's sponsor.

140
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,118
Now it's time to eat Ellie, I'm starving.

141
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:32,398
Woop, dinner is served times two.

142
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:34,319
We are gonna eat this dinner
and then there's some things

143
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,327
that we want to talk to the kids about.

144
00:05:36,327 --> 00:05:38,996
Also we have something
that we want to tell you.

145
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:41,402
I think we're going to
talk to the kids first,

146
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:42,324
and then we want to sit down

147
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:44,226
and Ellie and I want to
have a chat with you.

148
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:47,309
(sweet guitar music)

149
00:05:49,443 --> 00:05:51,971
- Ellie] Was that not the sweetest?

150
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:52,804
- Yeah.

151
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:54,631
- [Ellie] She was just sitting by you.

152
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,046
Aww, that was sweet too.

153
00:05:56,046 --> 00:05:56,879
Go sit down.

154
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,046
- [Jared] Come here Penny.

155
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:01,855
- [Ellie] Awww.

156
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,063
- [Jared] Wait wait,

157
00:06:06,515 --> 00:06:07,348
start.

158
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,448
Don't peek yet, don't peek, it's exciting.

159
00:06:12,448 --> 00:06:14,476
But we want to talk to you first, okay?

160
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:15,421
Are you ready?

161
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:18,101
We've got a couple things that
we want to show you, okay?

162
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:20,006
One for Jackson

163
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:21,615
and one for Calvin.

164
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,447
- We're gonna go somewhere.

165
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:26,537
This is for Jackson.

166
00:06:26,537 --> 00:06:27,370
- Ooh.

167
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,203
What is this?

168
00:06:28,203 --> 00:06:29,036
- Buzz Lightyear.

169
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:31,002
- Buzz Lightyear, do you want to hold it?

170
00:06:31,002 --> 00:06:31,929
- Yeah.

171
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:33,134
- Then Calvin,

172
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:33,967
- What is that?

173
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,467
- This is for you.

174
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,710
Do you like it?

175
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,543
- Uh-huh.

176
00:06:39,543 --> 00:06:40,756
- Are these swimming suits?

177
00:06:40,756 --> 00:06:43,752
- No, but you'll need your swimming suit.

178
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:46,712
We are gonna get on an airplane tomorrow

179
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:48,842
and we're gonna fly to Florida,

180
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:53,009
because we are going to
take you on a big big boat.

181
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,049
We're gonna go on a cruise

182
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,455
and we need to wear some costumes.

183
00:06:58,455 --> 00:07:00,433
So we got you a Buzz Lightyear costume

184
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,897
and a Woody costume.

185
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:03,876
- Do you know how we went to Disneyland?

186
00:07:03,876 --> 00:07:06,249
This is a Disney boat.

187
00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:09,453
- We're gonna see Mickey Mouse and Pluto,

188
00:07:09,453 --> 00:07:11,800
and Goofy and Minnie Mouse,

189
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,132
and all of our friends from Disney.

190
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:17,405
And you are gonna dress
up as Buzz Lightyear.

191
00:07:17,405 --> 00:07:18,238
- Me.

192
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,071
- And Woody.

193
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,792
Yeah that's right, that's you.

194
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:21,746
- And this is me.

195
00:07:21,746 --> 00:07:22,594
- That's right.

196
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:24,829
Oh Jackson there's one more thing.

197
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:28,092
You need your space ranger helmet.

198
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:29,259
- Does it fit?

199
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,126
Wow, do you like it?

200
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:32,959
- Uh-huh.

201
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,792
- Good.

202
00:07:33,792 --> 00:07:34,994
- Are you boys so excited?

203
00:07:34,994 --> 00:07:35,904
- Here we go.

204
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:36,737
- This is so fun.

205
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:37,969
We are so excited to take you

206
00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:40,307
and we're gonna go with you, is that okay?

207
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,154
- [Ellie] Look at these bodies.

208
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,758
- [Jared] Okay, come
stand next to Jackson.

209
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:48,172
- [Ellie] You guys look so cute.

210
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,005
Woo hoo!

211
00:07:50,365 --> 00:07:52,782
Woody and Buzz, here we come.

212
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:56,573
We are packed and ready to go.

213
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:02,297
- [Jared] Yay!

214
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:05,797
(vocalizing and clapping)

215
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,253
- [Ellie] Okay.

216
00:08:09,253 --> 00:08:12,920
- We have vlogged for
1,210 consecutive days

217
00:08:14,698 --> 00:08:17,755
without missing a single day.

218
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:21,184
- That's with us getting pregnant,

219
00:08:21,184 --> 00:08:25,752
having babies, having
post-partum, sleepless nights.

220
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:29,825
- Going to funerals,
family trips, camping,

221
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,160
where there's no internet.

222
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,672
We drove four hours to upload

223
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:35,544
and then drove four hours back

224
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:36,784
to be with family.

225
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:37,960
- Which we loved.

226
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:40,083
And I have loved doing the daily videos.

227
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,823
And we've never missed a day

228
00:08:41,823 --> 00:08:44,736
because that's what we had chosen to do.

229
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:45,569
- Absolutely.

230
00:08:45,569 --> 00:08:46,900
- We've never wanted to miss a day

231
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,483
and I think that now's the time

232
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,280
to just take, just a small break

233
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,024
and then we'll be right back on track.

234
00:08:55,024 --> 00:08:55,857
- Yeah.

235
00:08:55,857 --> 00:08:59,232
So we're gonna take a
break just like Ellie said.

236
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:01,480
When we go on this cruise,

237
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,344
we won't be uploading every single day.

238
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,757
And that feels, it feels

239
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:07,678
- I hate it.

240
00:09:07,678 --> 00:09:10,581
- Yeah, it feels so weird
to me that I say that.

241
00:09:10,581 --> 00:09:11,757
- I know it's not a big deal,

242
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:14,973
but to us, we really like
that we've been able to say

243
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,427
we've been doing dailies.

244
00:09:16,427 --> 00:09:18,735
We have fun with it, and
we want to keep doing it.

245
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:22,519
Jared and I had this cruise scheduled

246
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:24,851
and booked a few months ago.

247
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:28,074
Our plan was to pre-film some videos,

248
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,610
like challenges, Q & A's, fun videos,

249
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,033
have them go up while we were gone

250
00:09:33,033 --> 00:09:35,386
and then come home and do
one video of the cruise.

251
00:09:35,386 --> 00:09:38,874
As it got closer and us going
through our miscarriage,

252
00:09:38,874 --> 00:09:41,554
this is like good timing and bad timing.

253
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:43,298
We've kind of canceled some trips,

254
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:45,903
we've canceled some things
that we had on our schedule,

255
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:49,545
because I just needed to take a breather

256
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:52,399
and cancel things, and this was actually

257
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,221
on that cancellation list.

258
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,984
And I told Jared let's
just see how we feel

259
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,544
after a few days.

260
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:01,248
And I think that this will be good for us.

261
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:02,081
- Yeah.

262
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:04,200
- I would never have booked a cruise to go

263
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,888
only like a week after miscarrying.

264
00:10:05,888 --> 00:10:08,389
- I think if we would
have known this was gonna

265
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:10,176
happen, we wouldn't have scheduled it.

266
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:13,022
- No, but this is where
we are at right now.

267
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:14,954
We have decided to go.

268
00:10:14,954 --> 00:10:17,057
It'll be really fun for the boys.

269
00:10:17,057 --> 00:10:17,890
From what we've heard,

270
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:20,399
you can get some relaxing time in.

271
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,232
We'll see.

272
00:10:21,232 --> 00:10:22,111
I'm looking forward to it.

273
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:23,583
- I absolutely am.

274
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,442
I mean when we think think about it,

275
00:10:24,442 --> 00:10:27,442
vlogging for 1,210 consecutive days,

276
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:30,919
you know, there is some times

277
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:33,113
where you just have a little burn out.

278
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:35,665
And I feel like this is
gonna be a great time for us

279
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:36,904
- To recoup.

280
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:39,409
- To recoup physically,
mentally, emotionally

281
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,871
- Spiritually.

282
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,016
- And all of that.

283
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,716
And even just between Ellie and I,

284
00:10:44,716 --> 00:10:46,345
I feel like this is gonna be a great time

285
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,987
to have together.

286
00:10:47,987 --> 00:10:51,542
- I feel like Jared and I
really have grown closer

287
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,883
than anything else that we've had

288
00:10:53,883 --> 00:10:56,646
in our almost eight years of marriage.

289
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:59,383
I feel like I've re-fallen
in love with Jared.

290
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:02,694
I really have, like there's
been many tears shed

291
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:03,904
on his shoulder this week

292
00:11:03,904 --> 00:11:06,120
and he's been there to pick me up.

293
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,719
And I haven't done much to pick him up,

294
00:11:07,719 --> 00:11:09,187
he's a lot heavier than me.

295
00:11:09,187 --> 00:11:11,242
I've enjoyed my time with you this week.

296
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:12,133
- Well thank you and I love you.

297
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,021
Woo.

298
00:11:13,021 --> 00:11:13,854
- Love it.

299
00:11:13,854 --> 00:11:15,079
- I've been working
out, so it's really easy

300
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:16,878
to carry you, put you on my shoulders.

301
00:11:16,878 --> 00:11:19,217
This is pretty unique for us
to do, as you guys can tell.

302
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:23,322
- Even days where there has
been a day where we're like

303
00:11:23,322 --> 00:11:24,407
oh we don't really fell like filming,

304
00:11:24,407 --> 00:11:26,151
it's always been really nice, too,

305
00:11:26,151 --> 00:11:28,733
because I have loved capturing our kids.

306
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:29,566
- Yeah.

307
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:32,372
- And I've loved capturing
just what we've been doing.

308
00:11:32,372 --> 00:11:35,724
This has been so fun
for Jared and I to do.

309
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:37,641
- With that being said,

310
00:11:38,696 --> 00:11:41,255
we will take a break.

311
00:11:41,255 --> 00:11:43,327
We will see you guys soon.

312
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,411
Don't worry about everything.

313
00:11:45,411 --> 00:11:47,320
And I hope you guys understand.

314
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,585
I know there's gonna be some people

315
00:11:48,585 --> 00:11:49,792
who don't quite understand,

316
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,592
but we need some time
physically and mentally

317
00:11:53,592 --> 00:11:56,041
and this is weird timing,

318
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:57,631
the way it's all working out,

319
00:11:57,631 --> 00:11:59,655
but I feel like it's also good timing,

320
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:00,488
the way it's working out.

321
00:12:00,488 --> 00:12:01,321
- Yeah.

322
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,107
We will be back roughly in a week.

323
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,315
We go out tomorrow,

324
00:12:05,315 --> 00:12:07,459
I believe we get home

325
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:08,292
- Saturday?

326
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,783
- Saturday, so Saturday next week.

327
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:11,616
- Yeah.

328
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:13,014
- And then we'll have
maybe one or two days

329
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,677
of what we did on our little vacation

330
00:12:15,677 --> 00:12:16,623
and then we'll be back.

331
00:12:16,623 --> 00:12:18,343
So thank you guys,

332
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:19,703
this is really awkward for us,

333
00:12:19,703 --> 00:12:21,156
really weird to take a break.

334
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,068
It's gonna feel really weird.

335
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:24,487
- I feel almost like superstitious,

336
00:12:24,487 --> 00:12:26,471
but I know that it's necessary.

337
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:27,952
- Yeah, we're gonna turn our phones off.

338
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:30,060
We're gonna try to disconnect

339
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,887
just as much as we can.

340
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:36,335
- When we come back,
expect some great things.

341
00:12:36,335 --> 00:12:38,847
Expect some different things.

342
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:41,528
Expect some fun things.

343
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,158
And expect awesomeness,

344
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:45,406
because that's what we're gonna bring.

345
00:12:45,406 --> 00:12:47,238
- Okay, that's a lot of expectations

346
00:12:47,238 --> 00:12:48,292
that you just put on me.

347
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:52,476
- Shoot, did we overpromise
and are we gonna under deliver,

348
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:53,309
I don't know.

349
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,612
- Don't ever overpromise.

350
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:55,884
(laughing)

351
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:58,060
Okay, thank you guys for watching.

352
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,611
Thanks for being understanding.

353
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:02,059
Thanks for all the loving
kind words and stories

354
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:03,918
you've shared, especially
with me this week.

355
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:06,565
I have read them and I appreciate it.

356
00:13:06,565 --> 00:13:08,493
We'll see you guys next week.

357
00:13:08,493 --> 00:13:10,188
- We've never said that before.

358
00:13:10,188 --> 00:13:11,021
- Bye.

359
00:13:11,021 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
