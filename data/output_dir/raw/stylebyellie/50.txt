1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,145
- Happy Birthday to Joel!

2
00:00:02,145 --> 00:00:04,620
I feel like I want to tell
you guys what we're thinking,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,760
just so we're like all on
the same page, I guess.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,050
- 'Cause there will be a lot of changes

5
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,100
when the baby comes, and
this is just one of them.

6
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:11,408
Are you reading the story, Calvin?

7
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:12,241
- [Calvin] Yeah!

8
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:13,160
- Yeah?

9
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,804
In case we're not home by three o'clock,

10
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:16,664
we're going to Beaver Creek.

11
00:00:16,664 --> 00:00:17,497
- [Ellie] Okay.

12
00:00:17,497 --> 00:00:18,400
Have a fun, safe time.

13
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,290
- Thank you, love you.

14
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
- Bye.

15
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,840
Happy Birthday to Joel!

16
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,700
It is Joel's birthday tomorrow!

17
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,740
So, Jared and Joel

18
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,250
are going on a fun, little man-date.

19
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,060
And I'm getting Jacks ready for school.

20
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,820
And then Bonnie is coming over,

21
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,390
and we're filming a make-up video.

22
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,840
And I have my own girl's day!

23
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,610
We did not plan our day to be like this,

24
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,490
but I'm doing like a girl's night

25
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,540
tonight with my girlfriends.

26
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,810
We're going to dinner, Jared's
doing a man-date with Joel.

27
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,460
So, we're kind of like switching today.

28
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,680
But I'm gonna get all
dolled up for tonight.

29
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,327
Are you showing Grandma the rocks?

30
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:51,160
- Um hum.

31
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,620
- Which is your favorite one?

32
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:54,740
- That one.

33
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,130
- Yeah, that one is in the key chain, huh?

34
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,580
I'm so glad it hasn't come out yet.

35
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,650
Awesome!

36
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:03,500
It feels weird that I'm going
on a little date tonight

37
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,870
without Jared, but I just
grabbed my purse to go,

38
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,280
and I kind of laughed at what was in it.

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,610
There's not much in here.

40
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,750
I've got chap-stick,

41
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,760
I've got lip gloss, a pen,
a dime, kid's sunglasses,

42
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,980
a sucker, floss,

43
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:22,020
an empty thing of gum,

44
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,860
Jared's pen that goes in his office,

45
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,930
and another lip gloss.

46
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,680
So, lip glosses and mouth
items is my go-to in there,

47
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,513
I guess.

48
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,140
- How do you think these
teeth get so white, right?

49
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,340
- I'm laughing because
the have got, that's why.

50
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,790
That's what it looks like.
- Put things in and out.

51
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,245
Well, you're going on a date today.

52
00:01:40,245 --> 00:01:41,078
- [Ellie] Uh huh.

53
00:01:41,078 --> 00:01:41,911
- With your lady friends.

54
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,920
'Cause I went on a date
with my boy friend.

55
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,813
- [Ellie] That's okay, your man friend.

56
00:01:45,813 --> 00:01:48,160
- I went on a man-date with
Joel today, we had a lot of fun.

57
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,353
We went snowmobiling.

58
00:01:49,353 --> 00:01:50,820
It was great.

59
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,820
It was nice to just step
away from the world.

60
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,440
Like we were on the tops
of the mountain and just

61
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:03,170
looking and appreciating
the beauty, the wind.

62
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,470
And like there was one
point in time where we just

63
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,610
stopped, turned off our machines.

64
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,949
We were on the highest point
in all of northern Utah.

65
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:11,783
- [Ellie] Oh cool.

66
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,820
- And we just sat there and just did this.

67
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,623
- [Ellie] And then did you pee?

68
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:18,064
- Yeah, we were peeing.

69
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,260
(laughing)

70
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,970
No, no, but seriously,
like it was nice to just

71
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,770
be in our thoughts
without any distractions.

72
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,603
- Yeah.

73
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,990
I do feel bad because I
didn't plan the day like this.

74
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,130
I probably wouldn't have because

75
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,130
I knew that Jared wasn't gonna film.

76
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,100
And then tonight, I'm going
with my old girlfriends

77
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,940
and I'm like, I feel like
it's mom's day and we're

78
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,773
gonna go to dinner.

79
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,260
I don't think I'm gonna film.

80
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,570
So, I probably wouldn't have normally

81
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,640
planned our day like this.

82
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,990
But that's how it is.

83
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,660
And before I head out,

84
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,430
this is like a crazy, like guys we have

85
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,370
something to tell you, sit down.

86
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,480
But it is something that
I want to talk about.

87
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,590
- And it's something that we've thought

88
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,423
about for a long time.

89
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,256
- Yeah.

90
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:56,620
Just because I feel like if I say it,

91
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,483
I'll feel at ease.

92
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:01,100
I don't know why that is,
but like when you do videos

93
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,020
for so long it's like, I'm like

94
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,970
I've been thinking this
and having it to myself.

95
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm like, I feel like
I want to tell you guys

96
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,330
what we're thinking just so we're like

97
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,660
all on the same page, I guess.

98
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,030
Thank you guys for being so sweet

99
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,770
and supportive in my video.

100
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,350
Where I've had, I'm feeling much better.

101
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,620
Where the last few weeks,
I was feeling really down

102
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,240
in the dumps mentally.

103
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,030
I felt like I couldn't pick myself up.

104
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,150
I felt very just emotionally
and mentally drained.

105
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,680
And I feel like I'm starting
to come out of that.

106
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,470
Jared and I have been talking.

107
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,280
I've been voicing some
concerns of mine because,

108
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,330
I don't know if I should
just not even worry about it

109
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,894
and wait for the time to
come, and then decide.

110
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,740
And so Jared's like, so let's just

111
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,200
decide when the time comes.

112
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,290
But let's plan it for
now, so you feel at ease.

113
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,390
- Yeah.

114
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,420
- And I'm worried when the baby comes.

115
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,190
I'm worried about myself.

116
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,140
I'm worried about what if I have a lot of

117
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,130
post-partum depression
like I had with Calvin,

118
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,790
but I don't do anything and I just like

119
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,810
kind of tough through it.

120
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,010
'Cause I didn't know what it was.

121
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,420
I was just like, "Oh, I'm okay."

122
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,820
And like, I ended up just
becoming even busier.

123
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,120
Because I was thinking
that it will distract me

124
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,460
and then I ended up crashing.

125
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,190
And I just had a really
hard time after Calvin.

126
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,760
And I, I worry about myself.

127
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,140
So I asked Jared, awhile ago,

128
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,670
and it wasn't that our
conversation went bad

129
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,920
but it's just, we kind
of didn't talk about it.

130
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,940
I mentioned it, and it kind of
didn't get brought up again.

131
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,340
- Well, I think you
mentioned it, and I was

132
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,540
just like, "No."

133
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,623
- Like we won't do that.

134
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:26,810
- No, I don't want to do that.

135
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,320
- And then I mentioned it again, and then,

136
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,350
I mentioned it again.

137
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,900
- And I think what it
came down to is like,

138
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,550
yeah, you mentioned it,
but I wasn't necessarily

139
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,430
thinking of you first.

140
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,200
And I think that's really important.

141
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,950
Because I need to think of you first.

142
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,140
And that's where we came down to this.

143
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,160
Is like okay, we need to look inward

144
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,940
before we look outward.

145
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,450
- And I, I just asked Jared
if when the baby comes,

146
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,701
we took a year off last year, and it.

147
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,360
(laughing)

148
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,750
We took a week off last
year, and it was very

149
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,727
refreshing, we loved that.

150
00:05:00,727 --> 00:05:01,760
- It was great.

151
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,210
- And we decided, okay,
every year it would be nice

152
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,460
to take a full week.

153
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,120
That would be awesome.

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,670
When the baby comes in
five months, I would like

155
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,430
to do Monday through Friday.

156
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,340
That way it gives us the weekend.

157
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,110
'Cause Sundays are very repetitive.

158
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,110
We go to church, we come home
and we honestly, just sit.

159
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,650
It's just our day to like, sit.

160
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,660
And so, it's repetitive.

161
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,300
And I said I would love to take

162
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,410
Saturdays and Sundays
off when the baby comes.

163
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,730
Because that will give us
an opportunity to really

164
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:34,170
focus on us on Sundays,
and then on Saturdays,

165
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,930
really just like put
everything away and unwind.

166
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,710
And then that way, we're fresh for Monday.

167
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,890
Regardless, we're all going to
be exhausted with a new baby.

168
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,670
And I just feel like
that might be something

169
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:48,450
good for me, to look forward
to knowing the weekend

170
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,160
comes, and all I have to
do is think about the kids,

171
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,810
and that's my only thought.

172
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:55,480
- We've been filming
where we're two days ahead

173
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,380
and that has been great.

174
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,213
- Amazing.

175
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,330
- It has been wonderful.

176
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,470
And I just think while

177
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,856
the baby is here, that
would be even more help.

178
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:06,689
- Yeah.

179
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,790
- It would be even more nice to have time

180
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,130
to disconnect for that.

181
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,470
Being two days ahead is nice, but I think

182
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,557
when the baby comes, it'll be even better.

183
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:18,470
And we're still going to do
daily vlogs until that point.

184
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,530
- Yes.
- That's the plan.

185
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,470
- And we'll just see how I personally feel

186
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,710
when the time comes.

187
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,990
I'm grateful for Jared,
for being open-minded.

188
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,930
It's taken a long time for us to have

189
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,130
a conversation of us both
being okay and on the same

190
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,740
page about this decision.

191
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,090
I hope that everybody is understanding.

192
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,160
I'm sure you will be.

193
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,840
But that's what I'm going to plan on,

194
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,950
just to ease myself right now.

195
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,360
I don't want to have to think about

196
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,130
the future stress about it.

197
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:47,340
But my personality is that,

198
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,230
and so to me to be calm
right now, I just need me

199
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:54,650
to say this is what I'm doing
for me to feel good about it.

200
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,540
So, thank you for being
good to me right now.

201
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,954
- It's so, yeah.

202
00:06:57,954 --> 00:06:58,787
- It's what I need.

203
00:06:58,787 --> 00:07:00,350
- Well, it's just funny
because you say like,

204
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,370
"That's my personality."

205
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,570
Oh, to a freaking T!

206
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,200
It's your personality to
look forward, to plan ahead,

207
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,460
to set yourself up for
different situations.

208
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,128
Nothing is 100% set in stone.

209
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:14,961
- Yeah.

210
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:16,800
- And we are looking to take care

211
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,500
of ourselves and our family.

212
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,980
And things can change.

213
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,378
- And it might.

214
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:24,650
- And no matter what, no matter
what, it's going to be good.

215
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,600
It's going to be good.

216
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,310
- That's where we're at right now.

217
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,890
I just wanted to voice my opinion

218
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:30,799
and have an open conversation, so that

219
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:33,490
I feel at ease and good about
just talking about this.

220
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,870
So, on with the rest of the vlog.

221
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,210
Thank you guys for understanding.

222
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,780
I just wanted to put that out there now

223
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,859
so that everyone has like
five months to kind of prep.

224
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:41,692
(laughing)

225
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:43,820
And so we do too.
- Five months to prepare.

226
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,941
- For the baby!

227
00:07:44,941 --> 00:07:45,774
Woohoo!

228
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,870
- 'Cause there will be a
lot of changes when the baby

229
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,380
comes, and this is just one of them.

230
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,900
We didn't have a lot of
success the last time

231
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,480
we did this, but we're
going to try it again.

232
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,330
Okay kids, circle up!

233
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,895
Okay kids, circle up!

234
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:01,178
- Dada!

235
00:08:01,178 --> 00:08:02,730
Let's circle up.

236
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,950
- I'll take it, I'll
take it, all right guys,

237
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:08,210
so it is a beautiful day
outside and I am just

238
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,080
grateful that the sun is
shining, the warm air is upon us.

239
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,070
It is a beautiful day.

240
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,100
So, we are going to spend our time

241
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,669
outside before it gets
dark, does that sound good?

242
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:18,502
- Yeah.

243
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,790
- Daddy's gonna clean up some
of our mess from fire pit.

244
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,810
We're gonna throw the wood where it

245
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,800
needs to go, and do some more poop patrol.

246
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,130
And you guys can play on the slide

247
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,304
and just do whatever you want.

248
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:28,137
(children chattering)

249
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:29,672
- Even put that frame on
your head, yeah, I guess

250
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:30,505
you can do that.

251
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,930
All right frame-head, put the frame down

252
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,870
and let's go outside.

253
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,470
- [Jackson] Put it down, frame-head!

254
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,303
- [Jared] Good job!

255
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:37,135
Okay, let's go outside!

256
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:40,134
(happy guitar music)

257
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,670
Hi guys, how are you?

258
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,660
- Good.

259
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,493
- Good.

260
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:11,990
Are you reading the story, Calvin?

261
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,070
Yeah.

262
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,230
Hey, was it hot, or cold, or warm outside?

263
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,540
- Cold.

264
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,690
- [Jared] It was pretty cold?

265
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,100
Was it cold to wear winter gear

266
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,864
or did you have fun?

267
00:09:23,864 --> 00:09:24,730
- Have fun.

268
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,960
- Yeah, good.

269
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,360
It's starting to warm up a little bit.

270
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,440
That's kind of nice, isn't it?

271
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,460
We had a blast outside.

272
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,360
It was nice and warm.

273
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,070
I got a lot of clean-up done.

274
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:34,150
The kids played with Penny.

275
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,540
It was a beautiful thing.

276
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,670
Now, we're going to read a book.

277
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,966
Can you guys say
goodnight to your friends?

278
00:09:38,966 --> 00:09:40,736
- Goodnight!

279
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:41,930
- Goodnight!

280
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,450
- Love you, bye!

281
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,570
As you know, Ellie is out
with all of her lady friends.

282
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,590
She actually went all the
way down to Salt Lake.

283
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,870
So, I hope she is having a blast.

284
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,020
Joel and I had

285
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,210
a freaking blast on the
mountain snowmobiling.

286
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,530
We only got stuck three times each.

287
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,700
And actually, while we were
there, when we were stuck,

288
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,070
trying to dig ourselves
out, someone drove by.

289
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,130
Luckily, it was actually pretty cool.

290
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,850
He taught us a different way

291
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,180
than we thought to get the machines out.

292
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,710
With four-wheelers and jet-skis,
it's like kind of taboo.

293
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,060
You you don't do this.

294
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,930
You don't roll the machine over

295
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:20,810
like its handlebars to
get it back onto its end.

296
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,780
But with snowmobiles, he's
like, "Oh yeah, that's

297
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,890
"the only way we do it."
it's so much easier than

298
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,240
trying to dig yourself out.

299
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,640
Because you're digging, and then lifting,

300
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,080
and pulling, and rolling
it is so much easier.

301
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,450
So every time after that, Joel

302
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,210
and I just rolled the machines over.

303
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,410
And we did it, and it was so much easier.

304
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,550
Because if you've ever gone

305
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,860
snowmobiling before, getting
stuck is like the worst

306
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,350
thing ever, but it's kind
of part of the adventure.

307
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,540
So, we learned something new.

308
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,800
We had a blast and Joel's

309
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,692
birthday is tomorrow,
so Happy Birthday Joel.

310
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:48,180
That's kind of why we did it.

311
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,090
It was for his birthday.

312
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,860
So, kids are asleep.

313
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,300
We have had a great night.

314
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,730
We dropped some information on you

315
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,030
and nothing is changing yet.

316
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,940
And I don't want you to
think this is a big change.

317
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,010
This isn't too crazy.

318
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,970
But when we have the baby things

319
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,340
are gonna be a little bit different.

320
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,610
We're excited about that
and it's gonna be great.

321
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,290
So, thank you so much for your support.

322
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,410
Thank you so much for understanding

323
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,020
and we're so grateful for you.

324
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,780
We are grateful for each
and every one of you.

325
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,640
So, thank you for tuning in with us every

326
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,280
single day, to be a part of our family.

327
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,130
So, thank you guys.

328
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,070
And with that, I'm going to end the night.

329
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,540
Thank you guys for watching and we will

330
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,620
see you guys tomorrow.

331
00:11:20,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
