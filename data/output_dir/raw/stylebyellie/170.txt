1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:03,181
(bright music)

2
00:00:10,953 --> 00:00:13,603
- [Ellie] Guys guys guys, it's working.

3
00:00:13,603 --> 00:00:14,436
It's working.

4
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:15,405
- She's running.

5
00:00:15,405 --> 00:00:17,405
- [Ellie] It is working.

6
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,831
(laughing)

7
00:00:30,919 --> 00:00:33,086
(yelling)

8
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:36,384
- Waking up to a day with family

9
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:38,384
always puts a smile on your face.

10
00:00:38,384 --> 00:00:41,544
We have our cousin Kate here.

11
00:00:41,544 --> 00:00:44,736
And we are going to see
someone special today.

12
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:45,569
- Awww.

13
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:47,946
- Big hugs.

14
00:00:47,946 --> 00:00:49,740
Good to see you.

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,323
(bright music)

16
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,852
- Mom is here to test
out the cinnamon rolls

17
00:01:04,852 --> 00:01:06,147
that we have made.

18
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:07,387
Are they a 10?

19
00:01:07,387 --> 00:01:08,220
- They are a 10.

20
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,958
(laughing)

21
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:10,791
- Please tell me they're a 10.

22
00:01:10,791 --> 00:01:12,461
They're a 10 right?

23
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,046
I made cinnamon rolls yesterday

24
00:01:14,046 --> 00:01:16,111
and we're eating some
for a snack right now.

25
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:17,878
And they're very good.

26
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:20,206
And Julie, it feels like
you never even left.

27
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,734
- It feels completely normal to be here.

28
00:01:22,734 --> 00:01:25,230
- I know, it's just like
oh Julie's here, yay.

29
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,165
It's as if she never left,

30
00:01:27,165 --> 00:01:28,815
so I'm happy to have you back.

31
00:01:28,815 --> 00:01:30,232
- Well thank you.

32
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,697
- [Ellie] What the heck Linc?

33
00:01:33,697 --> 00:01:35,846
(laughing)

34
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:36,897
I'm mad.
- He was sitting there

35
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:37,730
- Hey.
- and he was like I want

36
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,524
- a bite and I was like
here, Ellie, have some.

37
00:01:39,524 --> 00:01:40,357
- Have a bite.

38
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:41,530
- [Ellie] That's my cinnamon roll.

39
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:42,486
(snorting)

40
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:44,703
You like my cinnamon roll?

41
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,693
Is it yummy to you?

42
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:47,526
What the?

43
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,621
You greedy little baby.

44
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,990
- We've got family back in town.

45
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,823
- Woo!

46
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:54,101
- Landon's in the house.

47
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:55,626
And Joel thought it'd
be the best idea ever

48
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:57,861
in the whole entire world
to go four-wheeling.

49
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:58,787
So that's what we're doing.
- Of course,

50
00:01:58,787 --> 00:01:59,792
- we have to go four-wheeling.

51
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:00,625
- It's a beautiful day.

52
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:02,168
Cody, are you ready to hit the trails?

53
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:04,043
Let's do it, high five.

54
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,229
Boom!

55
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,812
(lively music)

56
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:22,778
(four-wheeler motoring)

57
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,820
I'll throw it to ya.

58
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,987
One two three.

59
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:51,967
Shhhh.

60
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,288
(Jared laughing)

61
00:02:57,288 --> 00:02:58,321
Woo!

62
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:01,071
(Jared laughing)

63
00:03:14,635 --> 00:03:17,302
(wind whipping)

64
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,782
(four-wheeler motoring)

65
00:03:27,782 --> 00:03:29,309
- We shared a bed for how many years?

66
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,356
We can share a car.

67
00:03:30,356 --> 00:03:31,564
(laughing)

68
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:32,981
Woo hoo, we are going for a ride.

69
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,505
- Oh it's so slow.

70
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,387
- Oh, we don't want to break it.

71
00:03:37,387 --> 00:03:38,812
- Forward.

72
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,592
It's going so slow.

73
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:41,760
- I like it.

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,678
- Sorry kids, no batteries
for you in a minute.

75
00:03:43,678 --> 00:03:45,598
- Push all the kids away.

76
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:47,593
- No battery left when we're done.

77
00:03:47,593 --> 00:03:48,811
Oh no!

78
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,644
(laughing)

79
00:03:49,644 --> 00:03:51,847
- We've taking up all the juice.

80
00:03:51,847 --> 00:03:55,097
(cheerful jazzy music)

81
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:24,545
- So the boys just got back

82
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:25,674
and we're shuffling kids around,

83
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:27,467
getting them situated for bed.

84
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,344
And I want to show you this real quick.

85
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,297
So we went four-wheeling,
you obviously know that,

86
00:04:31,297 --> 00:04:33,301
but I feel like there's an indication

87
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:35,124
of how much fun we had,

88
00:04:35,124 --> 00:04:37,365
the more mud, the more fun.

89
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:38,198
This is my GoPro.

90
00:04:38,198 --> 00:04:39,628
- Whoa.

91
00:04:39,628 --> 00:04:40,461
What?

92
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:43,675
- It is caked in mud,

93
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:45,436
so we had a lot of fun.

94
00:04:45,436 --> 00:04:46,269
- That's awesome.

95
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,171
- You probably don't want to touch it.

96
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:48,548
I'm gonna go wash it.

97
00:04:48,548 --> 00:04:50,347
And that's the thing about
GoPro, it's waterproof,

98
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:51,680
so it's perfect.

99
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,589
- Do you guys remember when we bought

100
00:04:56,589 --> 00:04:58,019
a huge bag of gummy bears

101
00:04:58,019 --> 00:05:01,042
that supposedly they're sugar free

102
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:03,538
and they're supposed to make you poop?

103
00:05:03,538 --> 00:05:04,762
We've had them.

104
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,704
We have family over.

105
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,141
We are gonna use them,

106
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,341
and we're gonna see if they work.

107
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:11,174
(laughs devilishly)

108
00:05:11,174 --> 00:05:12,007
Now I'm not that mean,

109
00:05:12,007 --> 00:05:13,245
I'm gonna go in on the game too.

110
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:17,116
I'm gonna be eating these,
as well, so we'll see.

111
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:19,550
Sugar free, look at the reviews on Amazon.

112
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,965
They're hilarious.

113
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,695
Gummy bears, Charleston Chews,

114
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,250
what other treats do I have in here?

115
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,627
And some chocolate, that should work.

116
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:27,460
- This is the first time Landon

117
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,778
has ever been to our house,

118
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:32,175
and so he's like I'm gonna
unload the dishwasher

119
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:34,222
and find out where everything goes,

120
00:05:34,222 --> 00:05:35,563
so thanks
- I'm breaking in the house.

121
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:37,182
- for breaking in the house.

122
00:05:37,182 --> 00:05:38,849
Ooh these look good.

123
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:42,294
- Alright, while we let
those gummy bears marinate,

124
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:43,446
we'll see if they work.

125
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:44,372
It was really funny,

126
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,284
we bought them forever
ago, wanting to do this,

127
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:47,996
and tonight's the perfect night.

128
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:49,314
Bonnie and Joel are coming over,

129
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,495
Landon and Julie are here,

130
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:51,328
we're getting the kids to bed,

131
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:52,763
we're all getting in the hot tub.

132
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,741
Jared said that a lot of you guys

133
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:55,839
have been asking what Jared got me,

134
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,672
when we were on the cruise ship

135
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:59,601
and he took me into the Tiffany's store.

136
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:01,104
So I do want to show you the necklace.

137
00:06:01,104 --> 00:06:04,201
It was really sweet and thoughtful of him.

138
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:05,378
I will hold it right here.

139
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:06,997
Jared over the years of being married,

140
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:09,783
has bought me several really sweet items

141
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:10,831
that I will have forever,

142
00:06:10,831 --> 00:06:12,991
and this is one of them.

143
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,280
It is a smiley little necklace

144
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,266
that goes kind of below my collarbone.

145
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:19,314
And it's really flattering,

146
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:22,514
it's really small and simple and pretty.

147
00:06:22,514 --> 00:06:24,404
And that's what it looks like.

148
00:06:24,404 --> 00:06:25,590
Thank you Jared.

149
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,423
I love it.

150
00:06:26,423 --> 00:06:28,355
- Now I can see this going
a couple different ways.

151
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:33,014
Either it goes perfectly and
it's just a total disaster

152
00:06:33,014 --> 00:06:34,623
or it actually is a disaster

153
00:06:34,623 --> 00:06:36,558
and no one eats anything,

154
00:06:36,558 --> 00:06:38,566
or they do eat it, and nothing happens.

155
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:41,606
So I don't know, I've had
a couple myself to see

156
00:06:41,606 --> 00:06:43,701
if it actually does anything,

157
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:46,451
just to kind of lessen suspicion.

158
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:49,086
So we'll see.

159
00:06:49,086 --> 00:06:50,964
This may totally backfire, I don't know.

160
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:52,587
We got to try it sometime.

161
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:55,128
And I think it's been long
enough that no one remembers it.

162
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:57,355
I'm like wait, let me turn the light on.

163
00:06:57,355 --> 00:06:58,188
- [Ellie] Are you ready?

164
00:06:58,188 --> 00:07:01,202
- [Jared] Yes, ready, three two one.

165
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,202
Ooh eee ooh.

166
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,264
Wait, yeah, ooh eee ooh.

167
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:08,736
Do you have to do it for all of them?

168
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:10,295
- [Julie] I thought they were gonna like

169
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:11,578
- [Jareed] I thought it was
- start moving and dancing

170
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,899
- or something.
- gonna be more grand.

171
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,385
- [Jared] Individually one by one,

172
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:16,840
and what was the pattern Ellie?

173
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,780
You started with that one,

174
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,459
you went all the way over there.

175
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:20,299
(laughing)

176
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,138
What is your pattern idea there?

177
00:07:21,138 --> 00:07:22,933
- I was just trying to scare ya.

178
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,766
- [Jared] Ooh eee ooh.

179
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,203
- Very scary.

180
00:07:27,203 --> 00:07:28,036
- That's cute.

181
00:07:28,036 --> 00:07:28,981
- Very very scary.

182
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:29,814
Our house is scary.

183
00:07:29,814 --> 00:07:31,241
Jackson comes up in the
middle of the night,

184
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:32,562
and he's like Mom and Dad,

185
00:07:32,562 --> 00:07:34,377
there's ghosts in our house.

186
00:07:34,377 --> 00:07:36,201
- Awww.
- Awww.

187
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:37,626
- Hey he loves them.

188
00:07:37,626 --> 00:07:39,134
- [Jared] He does love them.

189
00:07:39,134 --> 00:07:40,750
- They all watched Hotel
Transylvania today,

190
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,009
so they might have nightmares.

191
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:44,110
- Oh that was a little crazy,
that was Olivia's request.

192
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,310
- I love Hotel Transylvania.

193
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,109
- Well what's funny is like
what movies they do think about

194
00:07:49,109 --> 00:07:49,942
in the middle of the night,

195
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:50,775
and what movies they don't,

196
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,915
because you're like Jackson
you just watched Spiderman

197
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,538
and you loved it,

198
00:07:55,538 --> 00:07:57,772
and then you watched Curious George

199
00:07:57,772 --> 00:08:00,076
and you have nightmares
about Curious George.

200
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,660
Like what the heck?

201
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,164
- He's a monkey, he's a monkey.

202
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:03,997
- I know.

203
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,164
(playful music)

204
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:10,882
We already have our first
victim, Ellie is down,

205
00:08:10,882 --> 00:08:12,717
and I am dying right now.

206
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:14,578
I am prairie dogging like
crazy, holding it in.

207
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,443
- [Ellie] Oh are you really?

208
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:16,637
- Yes I am.

209
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:17,470
- [Ellie] You're not just saying that,

210
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,303
are you really?

211
00:08:18,303 --> 00:08:19,171
- Yes I am.

212
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,931
I've had three and I'm dying.

213
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:22,764
I'm gonna go make 'em.

214
00:08:22,764 --> 00:08:25,038
- [Ellie] You're laughing,
but we're having issues.

215
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:26,397
- I know, it hurts.

216
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:27,689
Had you ever had one?
- Triple-stuffed

217
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:29,126
- Like triple-stuffed those things,

218
00:08:29,126 --> 00:08:30,667
like I love stuffed Oreos
and I have a thin one

219
00:08:30,667 --> 00:08:32,610
and I'm like mmmm.

220
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,208
- They have mega stuffed,
which are not that good.

221
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:36,193
- [Bonnie] No.

222
00:08:36,193 --> 00:08:37,716
- Thin Oreos are like the go to.

223
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,636
- [Bonnie] The way to go.

224
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:41,328
- [Jared] We have so many good snacks.

225
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:42,741
Bonnie and Joel brought some over.

226
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,416
They're pretty good I guess.

227
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,496
Are you guys jelly-filled,
or just like regular donuts?

228
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:50,528
I'm regular for sure.

229
00:08:50,528 --> 00:08:51,361
- Jelly-filled.

230
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,770
- It depends, because
if it's powder coated,

231
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,602
it has to have raspberry inside.

232
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,898
- I'm just not a creme-filled fan.

233
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:56,880
- [Joel] Creme-filled's terrible.

234
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,713
- [Landon] What?

235
00:08:57,713 --> 00:08:58,546
- [Jared] Yeah.

236
00:08:58,546 --> 00:08:59,379
- No.

237
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,654
- Lemon-filled, lemon-filled,

238
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:01,487
that's disgusting.

239
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:02,864
- What about like a Bavarian creme?

240
00:09:02,864 --> 00:09:04,114
- That's where it's at,

241
00:09:04,114 --> 00:09:04,972
chocolate and Bavarian
creme is our favorite.

242
00:09:04,972 --> 00:09:05,926
- [Jared] That sounds good.

243
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:07,616
- But there's always like four bites

244
00:09:07,616 --> 00:09:09,042
of plain donut and then all of a sudden,

245
00:09:09,042 --> 00:09:11,133
one huge gulp of Bavarian creme.

246
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:11,966
- That's true yeah.

247
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:13,432
- And you're like, did I
just swallow a pudding cup?

248
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:15,352
- Maybe if they could distribute the creme

249
00:09:15,352 --> 00:09:17,391
evenly through out the donut.

250
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,468
- I have had Bavarian
creme filled churros.

251
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,506
- That's a smart idea.
- That's good.

252
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:24,866
- You do it and then I'll do it.

253
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,699
Ready?

254
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:31,035
Nice.

255
00:09:31,035 --> 00:09:32,008
- All of our machines were like

256
00:09:32,008 --> 00:09:33,848
sliding into that position.

257
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:35,848
- That's three in a row.

258
00:09:37,713 --> 00:09:38,546
Same time.

259
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:42,452
Did you catch yours?

260
00:09:42,452 --> 00:09:43,285
- No, did you?

261
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:44,529
- Yeah, I barely got it.

262
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,571
- We got to throw it down, okay, ready?

263
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:50,519
(laughing)

264
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,073
- [Julie] Oh my gosh.

265
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:54,389
- [Bonnie] Did you choke it down?

266
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:56,771
- [Ellie] Is it in your tonsil?

267
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:58,371
- It's like I regurgitated it.

268
00:09:58,371 --> 00:09:59,204
- [Ellie] Did you like hit it,

269
00:09:59,204 --> 00:10:01,068
and throw it back out of your mouth?

270
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:05,235
- Okay, I think Landon has
had seven, seven gummy bears.

271
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:08,288
- Did you literally hear Julie.

272
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,017
- Did you ever get the ones from Amazon?

273
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:12,689
(slo' mo') Did you ever
get the ones from Amazon?

274
00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:14,071
From Amazon,

275
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,071
from Amazon.

276
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:18,335
- She's like these aren't the
ones from Amazon, are they?

277
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,305
I was like, no.

278
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:20,393
Hot tub time.

279
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:21,727
Maybe it's stupid to get in the hot tub,

280
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,456
but we're doing it.

281
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,256
It's worth the risk, extra chlorine.

282
00:10:25,256 --> 00:10:26,089
(laughs)

283
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:28,408
- A few moments later.

284
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:29,657
- How do you think the hot tub was?

285
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:30,490
- Amazing.

286
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,323
- It was so fun.

287
00:10:31,323 --> 00:10:32,156
- Oh yeah.

288
00:10:32,156 --> 00:10:32,989
- We have not been in it in a long time.

289
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,948
- It's not too hot,
and it wasn't too cold,

290
00:10:35,948 --> 00:10:37,268
it was like perfect.

291
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:38,914
- I saw a shooting star.

292
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:41,464
But before we play our game for the night,

293
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:43,566
Landon you listening?

294
00:10:43,566 --> 00:10:45,970
Those gummy bears are the ones

295
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:47,463
that we bought from Amazon, Miss Julie.

296
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,734
- I was like I swear you
bought some from Amazon.

297
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,333
And I swear these are still good.

298
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:53,558
- [Jared] Does anyone need to poop?

299
00:10:53,558 --> 00:10:56,004
- [Ellie] And Landon had a
ton, you've had a handful

300
00:10:56,004 --> 00:10:56,837
and you've had a handful.

301
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:57,670
- Well I haven't gone
to the bathroom yet, so.

302
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,449
- So far Jared and I have
gone to the bathroom.

303
00:11:00,449 --> 00:11:02,121
- [Jared] You haven't had to do anything?

304
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:03,454
- My bowels are solid.

305
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,287
- His bowels are solid.

306
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:05,974
- Seriously I've had like four of them

307
00:11:05,974 --> 00:11:07,714
and I'm like, I cannot hold this.

308
00:11:07,714 --> 00:11:08,547
- [Joel] Those?

309
00:11:08,547 --> 00:11:09,504
- Yes.
- Yes.

310
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:10,337
- [Joel] No way.

311
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,170
- [Ellie] No I'm dead serious,

312
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,279
Jared and I both went to the bathroom.

313
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,680
- [Julie] They're hard.

314
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,189
- I know.

315
00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:16,022
- [Julie] They are.

316
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:16,855
- [Jared] She had to poop.

317
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:17,688
- Oh my god.

318
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:18,521
- She had to go poop.

319
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:19,677
- Literally I went to the bathroom before

320
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,850
we got in the hot tub,
and I did eat a few.

321
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:22,815
- [Jared] So no one got sick?

322
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,648
- [Joel] No.

323
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:24,481
- [Jared] Is this a bust?

324
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,320
- [Ellie] It's a bust.

325
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,153
- [Jared] Are these busts.

326
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,751
- All those comments.

327
00:11:27,751 --> 00:11:28,584
- Landon had like four.

328
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,402
- [Ellie] Okay, we're
gonna keep eating them,

329
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:31,735
and let ya know.

330
00:11:32,709 --> 00:11:34,105
(Ellie laughs)

331
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,497
Guys guys, it's working.

332
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:39,914
It's working, it's working, it's working.

333
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:41,665
Jared, it's working.

334
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:43,438
- We were just a little too anxious.

335
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:46,650
So I think the gummy bears
totally backfired on us.

336
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,177
I mean it really only
got me, Ellie and Julie.

337
00:11:50,177 --> 00:11:52,211
Landon who probably ate the most,

338
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:53,594
didn't have anything happen to him,

339
00:11:53,594 --> 00:11:55,728
but if you guys don't remember,

340
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,993
we ordered these from Amazon,

341
00:11:56,993 --> 00:11:58,317
the sugarfree gummy bears,

342
00:11:58,317 --> 00:11:59,969
they're supposedly supposed to make

343
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,679
your bowels explode, just
be totally devastating.

344
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,173
So we wanted to try and prank people

345
00:12:06,173 --> 00:12:09,354
and we tried to lure them
in by eating some of them,

346
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:11,042
but it backfired on us,

347
00:12:11,042 --> 00:12:13,826
and got us instead of everyone else.

348
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,520
Bonnie had some, Joel had some,

349
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,409
I think everyone had some,

350
00:12:17,409 --> 00:12:20,978
but me, Ellie and Julie got it the worst.

351
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:23,067
But I don't know, have
you guys ever tried them?

352
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,116
Let me know in the comments down below.

353
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:25,949
It's probably not smart,

354
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:27,842
but I'll have a link to it down below,

355
00:12:27,842 --> 00:12:29,866
if you guys want to try and get some too

356
00:12:29,866 --> 00:12:31,986
and try and prank your friends.

357
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,561
We have to be quiet.

358
00:12:33,561 --> 00:12:35,954
It's serious, kids are waking up.

359
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,046
We may have had a lot of fun

360
00:12:38,046 --> 00:12:38,934
and laughed really loud,

361
00:12:38,934 --> 00:12:40,764
and may have woken up some of the kids,

362
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:42,189

But Landon and Julie are
staying the night tonight.

00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:46,845

00:12:46,845 --> 00:12:48,173

366
00:12:48,173 --> 00:12:49,125

367
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:50,809
