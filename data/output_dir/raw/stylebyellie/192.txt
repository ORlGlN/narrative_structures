00:00:00,546 --> 00:00:03,028
♫ I'm a pinchy crab

2
00:00:03,028 --> 00:00:04,969
(screams)

3
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,684
- [Ellie] That's the legit crab.

4
00:00:06,684 --> 00:00:09,267
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:14,383 --> 00:00:16,445
Good morning, Penny.

6
00:00:16,445 --> 00:00:17,570
- [Jackson] Good morning, Penny.

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,379
- [Ellie] Good morning, Jackson.

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:20,212
- Good morning.

9
00:00:20,212 --> 00:00:22,541
- [Ellie] We have a special day today.

10
00:00:22,541 --> 00:00:23,693
What are we doing?

11
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:24,693
- Preschool!

12
00:00:26,014 --> 00:00:29,641
I'm wearing this backpack,
and this underwear,

13
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:33,558
and this pants, and this
shoes, and this shirt.

14
00:00:36,155 --> 00:00:37,245
- [Ellie] Wow.

15
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,434
- I'm gonna bring these rocks, too.

16
00:00:39,434 --> 00:00:40,267
- K.

17
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,951
Okay, you guys know that
Jackson loves rocks,

18
00:00:42,951 --> 00:00:45,057
and I'm not gonna tell him no,

19
00:00:45,057 --> 00:00:46,820
especially on the first day of preschool.

20
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,655
- I always put rocks in my rock box.

21
00:00:49,655 --> 00:00:50,878
- Yes, you do.

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,506
Why don't you put them right there?

23
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:53,686
Perfect.

24
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,097
Jackson and I are the only ones up,

25
00:00:57,097 --> 00:00:59,093
and it's actually we gotta go to school

26
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,093
in like 20 minutes, huh?

27
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:03,953
Everyone kinda had a
rough night last night,

28
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:06,300
so I think that's why
everyone's still sleeping.

29
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,569
- Yeah.

30
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,729
- Are you excited to
see your new teachers?

31
00:01:09,729 --> 00:01:10,768
- Yeah!

32
00:01:10,768 --> 00:01:11,774
- Yes.

33
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:13,258
K, let's get your pants on.

34
00:01:13,258 --> 00:01:15,896
What are you excited about for school?

35
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,759
- To play on the slide.

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,092
- On the slides?

37
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,904
- Yeah.

38
00:01:20,904 --> 00:01:22,411
- [Ellie] 'Cause they have slides outside?

39
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,385
- Yeah.

40
00:01:23,385 --> 00:01:25,803
- You'll be a really good
listener to your teacher.

41
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:26,712
- Okay.

42
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,448
- Right?
- Yeah.

43
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,615
- And we don't take toys out
of other people's hands, right?

44
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:34,356
- No.

45
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:35,586
- Okay.
- Right.

46
00:01:35,586 --> 00:01:40,202
- All right, little
mister, my Mr. Preschooler,

47
00:01:40,202 --> 00:01:41,561
this is your hair.

48
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:44,584
All right, guys, I've
been doing my boys' hair

49
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:46,456
for years, obviously--

50
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:49,218
- I'm a monkey. Ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

51
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:51,189
- And I've talked about
this a lot of times.

52
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:52,729
Can we show our friends your hair?

53
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,061
This is the hair gel that I use,

54
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:58,742
and their hair stays
looking nice all the time,

55
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:01,572
even when they're rough playing.

56
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:03,572
This is the Got 2b glue.

57
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,300
Excuse me.

58
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,826
K, I think you're ready.

59
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,826
- Let's go to preschool.

60
00:02:12,272 --> 00:02:15,368
♫ I'm a pinchy crab

61
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:16,779
♫ I'm a pinchy crab

62
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:19,463
- [Ellie] No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

63
00:02:19,463 --> 00:02:22,133
♫ I'm a pinchy crab

64
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,330
(screams)

65
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,441
that's the legit crab.

66
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:28,090
That looks scary.

67
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,564
Today is Jackson's day.

68
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,117
He's getting ready for preschool.

69
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:32,298
He's excited.

70
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:36,652
I want him to just have
what he wants today,

71
00:02:36,652 --> 00:02:39,289
and he is going to be cracking eggs,

72
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,377
'cause we are making eggs for breakfast.

73
00:02:41,377 --> 00:02:45,012
Hit it really hard once, really hard.

74
00:02:45,012 --> 00:02:46,083
Perfect.

75
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,739
This is your favorite thing to do, huh?

76
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:49,739
One of them.

77
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,613
Ooh, k.

78
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:54,105
- [Jackson] I got egg on me.

79
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,606
- That's one.

80
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:58,607
We'll pick some of the shells
out, and we'll try it again.

81
00:02:58,607 --> 00:03:01,450
By the third one, I bet you'll be a pro.

82
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,510
Look at his face.

83
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,767
Pick up another one, and
we'll crack it again.

84
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:05,600
Here, I'll show you one.

85
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,818
Then, you do one.

86
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:07,651
Do something like this.

87
00:03:07,651 --> 00:03:10,151
Do. (screams)

88
00:03:11,005 --> 00:03:11,973
(laughs)

89
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,140
Don't do that.

90
00:03:14,464 --> 00:03:16,164
Who knows how to crack an egg better?

91
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:17,703
Mom or the toddler?

92
00:03:17,703 --> 00:03:18,620
K, I meant.

93
00:03:19,524 --> 00:03:21,196
I don't know what I'm
doing holding a camera.

94
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:22,166
You try it.

95
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,532
(laughs)

96
00:03:24,532 --> 00:03:27,960
Here, here try it on here a little bit.

97
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,903
- I'm gonna spill it on the counter.

98
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:32,498
- [Ellie] Try, try not to do
what I did just a little bit.

99
00:03:32,498 --> 00:03:34,847
Hurry and hit it, and then bring it over.

100
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:35,680
Perfect.

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,110
Now, over here and peel it up.

102
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:37,943
Mama's gonna help, too.

103
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:39,737
One, two, three, like that.

104
00:03:39,737 --> 00:03:40,570
Perfect.

105
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,820
- [Jackson] I need a towel.

106
00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:47,433
- [Ellie] Good job!

107
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,736
That's a good crack.

108
00:03:49,736 --> 00:03:50,569
Good job.

109
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:55,306
Woohoo, that was pretty good.

110
00:03:55,306 --> 00:03:56,619
Just a few shells.

111
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,932
- [Jackson] I didn't spill.

112
00:03:57,932 --> 00:04:01,345
- [Ellie] Yeah, you did so good.

113
00:04:01,345 --> 00:04:02,845
- Strawberry milk!

114
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:06,152
Hot, hot, hot.

115
00:04:06,152 --> 00:04:07,845
- [Ellie] We are sitting
here eating breakfast,

116
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:10,824
and Jackson is looking
across at the stove,

117
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:13,252
and he said, "Look, I made that butterfly,

118
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:16,894
"and I made that picture for preschool".

119
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:18,218
You totally did, and I can't wait to see

120
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,577
what you make this year.

121
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:20,903
I love those two things.

122
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:24,441
- We've had them hanging
up ever since we got 'em.

123
00:04:24,441 --> 00:04:25,808
I'm so mad that--

124
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:27,300
- [Ellie] Our stupid refrigerator

125
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,020
doesn't hold magnets, guys.

126
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,205
- The front of our fridge isn't
magnetic, but the side is.

127
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:35,209
- [Ellie] But not the flipping front,

128
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:37,146
which I probably wouldn't
put a ton on there anyway,

129
00:04:37,146 --> 00:04:38,690
but, I mean, two things would be so cute.

130
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,920
- [Jackson] I wanna hold
it, I wanna hold it.

131
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,908
- You wanna hold this magnet?

132
00:04:40,908 --> 00:04:43,673
- [Ellie] But, instead,
I'll put 'em on my oven.

133
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:45,090
- I'm gonna pray.

134
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:47,340
Now, let's pray.

135
00:04:48,193 --> 00:04:49,026
Do it.

136
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:49,859
- [Ellie] Oh, you want me to do it?

137
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:50,692
- Yeah.

138
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:51,842
- [Ellie] I thought you wanted to pray.

139
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:53,445
- I just want you to pray.

140
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:56,324
- [Ellie] Okay, dear heavenly Father,

141
00:04:56,324 --> 00:04:58,907
(gentle music)

142
00:04:59,772 --> 00:05:01,390
and we say these things in
the name of Jesus Christ.

143
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,223
Amen.
- Amen.

144
00:05:02,223 --> 00:05:03,506
- [Ellie] Amen.

145
00:05:03,506 --> 00:05:06,089
(gentle music)

146
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:11,011
♫ I'm a pinchy crab

147
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,902
♫ I'm gonna pinch you there

148
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:14,169
(laughs)

149
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:16,752
(gentle music)

150
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:22,218
- Hey, past Jared, this is future Jared.

151
00:05:22,218 --> 00:05:23,784
Just wanted to come in and say hi.

152
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:24,718
Get ready for this workout,

153
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:27,058
'cause your legs are gonna be burning.

154
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,118
Trust me. I'm future Jared, and I know.

155
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,981
My legs are burning.

156
00:05:30,981 --> 00:05:33,814
(energetic music)

157
00:05:56,838 --> 00:05:58,934
- Are you ready to get
Jackson from school?

158
00:05:58,934 --> 00:05:59,798
- Yeah!

159
00:05:59,798 --> 00:06:00,965
- K, let's go!

160
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:03,691
Let's go!

161
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:07,121
Are you ready?

162
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:11,924
We have been seriously
doing a ton of phone calls,

163
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:15,119
getting some stuff done while
Jackson's been at school.

164
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,061
Have you missed Jackson?

165
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:18,755
You missed him playing with you,

166
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,716
and singing the bum song?

167
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:22,011
- Yeah.

168
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,099
- Bum bum bum, bum bum bum.

169
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:27,257
(gentle music)

170
00:06:27,257 --> 00:06:28,330
Jackson!

171
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,440
- [Jared] You're back!

172
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,952
- [Ellie] Are you excited?

173
00:06:30,952 --> 00:06:31,785
- Yeah.

174
00:06:31,785 --> 00:06:33,363
- [Ellie] Did you enjoy school today?

175
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:34,892
- Yeah, it was fun.

176
00:06:34,892 --> 00:06:36,269
- [Ellie] It was fun.

177
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,402
You had snack time, and then
you had extra class today

178
00:06:39,402 --> 00:06:41,085
of music time.

179
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,179
- [Jared] Did you have
a music class, today?

180
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,070
- I did a lot of things.

181
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,219
- [Ellie] What did you do in music class?

182
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:50,969
- I did Criss Cross
Applesauce, and I drummed

183
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:56,338
with sticks, and I did another song.

184
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:01,897
- [Ellie] Wow, can you
sing one of the songs?

185
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:04,945
♫ One, two, three, four, five

186
00:07:04,945 --> 00:07:06,365
- [Jared] That's one of my favorite songs.

187
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,703
- Well, when we picked Jackson up,

188
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,902
the music teacher came out.

189
00:07:09,902 --> 00:07:14,615
She's done this for 30 years,
and she teaches a lot of kids,

190
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:16,953
but sometimes she'll go to
preschools and do classes,

191
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:20,703
and she grabbed me and
said, "He is so good".

192
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:25,052
She said, "I really want
him to be a part of this,"

193
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:27,177
and she gave me a flyer
of this other music group.

194
00:07:27,177 --> 00:07:29,740
She said, "I would love
him to be a part of it,"

195
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,062
and I said, "That is so cool".

196
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:34,456
I was so flattered, and
I said, "It's funny,

197
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:37,596
"because Jackson," I mean,
we are a music family,

198
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,207
like Jared loves guitar and singing,

199
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:44,200
and it's funny 'cause Calvin
is so like loves to dance.

200
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,862
Calvin is totally like--

201
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:47,457
- He feels the music.

202
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:48,290
He feels it.

203
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,554
- Yeah, he's a total music boy, too,

204
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:52,470
and I know that Jackson is
too, but I've always felt like

205
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,150
Calvin has really enjoyed it,
so it was really fun to hear

206
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,299
the teacher say that
Jackson was participating

207
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:00,205
and was really good.

208
00:08:00,205 --> 00:08:01,292
I have a few flyers.

209
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,667
I've gotta look at our schedules
and figure some stuff out,

210
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,991
'cause I think that would
be so fun for them to be

211
00:08:06,991 --> 00:08:09,137
part of something else, as well.

212
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:11,263
- Jackson, give us an
overall view of the day.

213
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,015
Did you like preschool?

214
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:14,572
Do you wanna go back again?

215
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:15,481
Is it a thumbs up?

216
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,381
- Yeah.

217
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,253
- [Jared] Yeah, thumbs up for preschool.

218
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,086
(laughs)

219
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:20,291
- [Ellie] He's so tired.

220
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,041
- I played hopscotch.

221
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:25,015
I got some gems, and--

222
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,113
- [Ellie] You got a gem?

223
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:29,254
Is that for being a good boy?

224
00:08:29,254 --> 00:08:30,873
- I didn't get a prize yet.

225
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:33,977
- [Ellie] Yeah, you gotta
have enough gems, huh?

226
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:36,387
Did you see some friends there?

227
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,419
- Yeah, my best friend was there.

228
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,652
His name was, my, he
was a different friend.

229
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:45,268
- [Ellie] And you liked him?

230
00:08:45,268 --> 00:08:47,397
Good, I'm so glad.

231
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:48,630
Did you share?

232
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,463
- Yeah.

233
00:08:51,446 --> 00:08:52,329
- [Ellie] I'm so happy!

234
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:53,396
Are you hungry?

235
00:08:53,396 --> 00:08:55,126
- Yeah, I'm super hungry.

236
00:08:55,126 --> 00:08:57,140
- All right, guys, the
kids are taking a nap

237
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,479
and doing quiet time, and
I had to make a quick trip

238
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,424
out of the house.

239
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:03,241
We're having a little issue
with insurance right now,

240
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,941
trying to figure out how
our new insurance works.

241
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:09,324
I've had to go to all of the
doctors that the kids and I

242
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:12,076
have been to the last few
months and get some statements

243
00:09:12,076 --> 00:09:15,020
so I can send more
information to my insurance,

244
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,751
so I was like, "Oh, I
gottta get outta the house,

245
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,182
"gotta run these errands real quick".

246
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,257
I told Jared I was gonna run that errand

247
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:23,641
and that I would be back really quick,

248
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:26,224
and I had to stop and get Swig.

249
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:31,487
I hardly drink soda, but Swig is so good,

250
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,321
so I grabbed a soda, and I may or may not

251
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:37,155
totally have gone to Hobby Lobby,

252
00:09:37,155 --> 00:09:39,161
because I just wanna look at a little bit

253
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,294
of their decor stuff.

254
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:44,084
I feel a little guilty,
because Jared is doing so good.

255
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,220
He is drinking water
with all of his meals.

256
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,493
He's been working out.

257
00:09:47,493 --> 00:09:49,262
It's been a few days with his goal,

258
00:09:49,262 --> 00:09:51,990
and he is feeling really
motivated and good,

259
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,567
and I know that he'll watch this

260
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:55,719
and just smile and be
like, "You're cute, Ellie,"

261
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,950
but I do feel a little guilty.

262
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,224
I did text him, and I said,
"I'm gonna make one more stop".

263
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:03,818
I'm gonna enjoy my soda,
and I'm gonna hurry

264
00:10:03,818 --> 00:10:05,525
and go look at some Halloween stuff.

265
00:10:05,525 --> 00:10:08,010
All right, at the ocean,
you know that Grandma Great

266
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,637
asked Jackson to get her some seashells,

267
00:10:10,637 --> 00:10:13,087
and, when we packed our bags to come home,

268
00:10:13,087 --> 00:10:14,821
we packed seashells.

269
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:16,404
Look at these.

270
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:21,193
These are some of the big
ones that Jackson and I found.

271
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:22,026
Crazy.

272
00:10:23,315 --> 00:10:25,475
Jackson, what jar do you want?

273
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,410
- I just want.

274
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,471
- [Ellie] You want this one.

275
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:29,915
K, this is for mom.

276
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:31,237
I'm gonna put it in the bathroom,

277
00:10:31,237 --> 00:10:33,641
and we got this one for Grandma Great.

278
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:37,159
Look at all of those seashells
that she has in there.

279
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:37,992
You gonna dump that?

280
00:10:37,992 --> 00:10:39,614
Awesome.

281
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:42,037
Look how beautiful these are.

282
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:45,036
Seriously, it was so fun doing that.

283
00:10:45,036 --> 00:10:46,485
- Look how big this one is.

284
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:47,318
- [Ellie] I know.

285
00:10:47,318 --> 00:10:48,151
- [Jared] That's so cool.

286
00:10:48,151 --> 00:10:49,510
- I found this one.

287
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,607
- [Ellie] You did.

288
00:10:50,607 --> 00:10:52,641
You found almost all of them,

289
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:55,286
and this is the new home
for all of the seashells

290
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:56,429
that we collected.

291
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:59,156
We got a little figurine
of the lighthouses.

292
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:02,178
So sweet, and this one's yours.

293
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:04,158
Are you gonna put that next to your bed?

294
00:11:04,158 --> 00:11:08,414
- I'm gonna put them next to, on my clock.

295
00:11:08,414 --> 00:11:09,376
- [Ellie] Next to your clock?

296
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,043
That's a perfect idea, and--

297
00:11:12,043 --> 00:11:14,245
- Mine goes right here.

298
00:11:14,245 --> 00:11:15,575
- Perfect.

299
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,835
I love that.

300
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:18,366
We need to straighten some things up,

301
00:11:18,366 --> 00:11:22,172
but that is an awesome spot to put it.

302
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:25,012
Jackson, I had so fun looking
for seashells with you.

303
00:11:25,012 --> 00:11:26,762
That was so relaxing.

304
00:11:27,803 --> 00:11:29,917
I love the water.

305
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,483
The ocean is beautiful.

306
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,130
- [Jared] What are you
doing in there, hon?

307
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,617
- I'm getting my snacks.

308
00:11:34,617 --> 00:11:35,472
- [Jared] For what?

309
00:11:35,472 --> 00:11:37,117
- To watch my shows.

310
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:39,952
- Oh, the Bachelor in
Paradise is back in action.

311
00:11:39,952 --> 00:11:41,302
You've got a double feature.

312
00:11:41,302 --> 00:11:42,393
It was on yesterday.

313
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:43,995
You didn't watch it, and it's on today,

314
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,523
so Ellie's back in business.

315
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:47,736
I think I'm gonna join you,
but certainly not in those--

316
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:48,906
- Not like usual.

317
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,255
- Not with those snacks.

318
00:11:50,255 --> 00:11:53,413
I think what I'll do is I'll
just chew on this lemon,

319
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,830
'cause that's healthy, right?

320
00:11:57,363 --> 00:12:00,288
Oh snap, can we just talk
about how Wells dropped

321
00:12:00,288 --> 00:12:02,223
that truth bomb for a second?

322
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:03,592
You see Wells drop that truth bomb?

323
00:12:03,592 --> 00:12:04,425
- Yes.

324
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:07,254
- That was some deep stuff. Sorry.

325
00:12:07,254 --> 00:12:09,604
- [Ellie] I don't have
a heart to move Jackson.

326
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,161
- [Jared] He's so cute right here.

327
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:12,690
- He fell asleep.

328
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,515
- [Jared] Aw, hi, bud.

329
00:12:14,515 --> 00:12:15,723
- He doesn't do this much.

330
00:12:15,723 --> 00:12:17,963
He doesn't just fall asleep
in our bed like that.

331
00:12:17,963 --> 00:12:20,281
He'll come up, but he won't.

332
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,508
So cute.

333
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:23,305
- Hey, he had his first
day of school today.

334
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:25,114
How sweet is he?

335
00:12:25,114 --> 00:12:26,031
- Love you.

336
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,181
He's so tired.

337
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,014
- Yes, he is.

338
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,737
He zonked right out.

339
00:12:30,737 --> 00:12:33,608
I have filmed this clip like seven times

340
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:36,443
just trying to find
the right words to say.

341
00:12:36,443 --> 00:12:39,438
There's so much going on in the world,

342
00:12:39,438 --> 00:12:40,580
especially in our country.

343
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,388
I mean, we have Hurricane
Harvey, Hurricane Irma,

344
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,952
some states are on fire right now,

345
00:12:46,952 --> 00:12:49,959
and I just feel so bad for so many people

346
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:51,702
who are going through this right now.

347
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:54,683
Our thoughts and prayers and best wishes

348
00:12:54,683 --> 00:12:56,923
are for you guys right now.

349
00:12:56,923 --> 00:13:00,675
We have extended family
whose house burnt down today,

350
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:03,641
whose house was flooded
in Hurricane Harvey.

351
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:06,026
This is a difficult time
for a lot of people,

352
00:13:06,026 --> 00:13:08,281
and there's not a ton that we can do,

353
00:13:08,281 --> 00:13:11,081
but we want you to know that our hearts

354
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,996
and our prayers are
with you guys right now.

355
00:13:12,996 --> 00:13:16,379
Ellie and I have done some
donations as much as we can,

356
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,908
and we want to do more,
and we appreciate so many

357
00:13:18,908 --> 00:13:22,472
of you guys who have
given us links and ideas

358
00:13:22,472 --> 00:13:24,289
as far as things that we can do,

359
00:13:24,289 --> 00:13:26,583
and we've been doing those
things, so thank you for that.

360
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,178
We so appreciate it.

361
00:13:28,178 --> 00:13:30,372
I was reading an article
today on the internet

362
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,244
about backing up your electronic files

363
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:35,591
from your computer onto
an external hard drive

364
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:38,164
or a USB drive or anything
that you can back stuff up,

365
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,838
because that is something
that a lot of people

366
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:41,439
don't think of is that kind of thing.

367
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:44,633
Everything is so physical, but,
if you guys are going to be

368
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:46,693
evacuating or anything
like that, I encourage you

369
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,640
to make sure your computer's backed up.

370
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,505
It's a lot easier to take
a hard drive than it is

371
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:52,986
an entire computer, and those
pictures, those memories,

372
00:13:52,986 --> 00:13:55,767
a lot of those are digital now,
and that's one of the things

373
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:58,681
that we don't want to
lose is those memories,

374
00:13:58,681 --> 00:14:00,472
and we wanna hold onto those forever.

375
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,568
Again, our thoughts and our
prayers are with you guys.

376
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:05,709
We hope you guys are doing
the best that you can,

377
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,968
and, with that, we're gonna end the vlog.

378
00:14:07,968 --> 00:14:09,174
Thank you guys for watching.

379
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,475
Hope you guys are doing well,
and we will see you tomorrow.

380
00:14:11,475 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
