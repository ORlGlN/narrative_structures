1
00:00:00,121 --> 00:00:01,338
- What do you wanna get?

2
00:00:01,338 --> 00:00:02,421
- A nice hat.

3
00:00:03,367 --> 00:00:04,360
My hair's a mess.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,016
- This is as good as we're getting today.

5
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:07,519
- What do you think of your glasses?

6
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:08,652
- [Ellie] I like 'em, thanks.

7
00:00:08,652 --> 00:00:09,690
- You're welcome, they're

8
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,490
nice and rose gold.
- Jared ran to WalMart.

9
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,885
- [Ellie] Hi baby!

10
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:13,745
- Good morning, baby.

11
00:00:13,745 --> 00:00:15,130
- Oh my gosh.

12
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,772
- Ellie, your belly has popped.

13
00:00:16,772 --> 00:00:18,427
- Look, that's just in the morning.

14
00:00:18,427 --> 00:00:19,260
Holy cow.

15
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,335
- Wait 'till you get a
good meal inside of ya.

16
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:23,722
- [Ellie] I'm out of breath.

17
00:00:23,722 --> 00:00:24,763
- Goin' up the stairs?

18
00:00:24,763 --> 00:00:25,630
- I tried the stairs.

19
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,964
Kay, fun adventurous day.

20
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:29,470
The sun is out.

21
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,303
We're gonna go play.

22
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:32,325
- Yeah, I got some cool
aviators like Ellie did.

23
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:33,870
I went to the store and
grabbed some sunglasses.

24
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,106
So here's the situation.

25
00:00:35,106 --> 00:00:36,950
Everyone is literally
getting in their cars.

26
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,590
We're gonna go have a blast today

27
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:42,697
and I am using my phone
to upload the video.

28
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:43,963
I'm not uploading from my phone,

29
00:00:43,963 --> 00:00:46,390
I'm using my phone as the upload place.

30
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:49,546
So I'm using YouTube on my
phone to upload the video,

31
00:00:49,546 --> 00:00:51,227
and it's taking a lot
longer than I thought

32
00:00:51,227 --> 00:00:53,130
so I'm literally like
as soon as that's done,

33
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,125
I'm sprinting out to the car

34
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:56,823
and we are gonna go have a blast.

35
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:57,755
We're gonna go take the kids

36
00:00:57,755 --> 00:01:00,242
to a place that looks like Mars,

37
00:01:00,242 --> 00:01:02,424
and I know the kids will
have so much fun there.

38
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:04,435
It's going to be so great.

39
00:01:04,435 --> 00:01:05,780
So come on, Internet.

40
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,809
Come on, YouTube.

41
00:01:06,809 --> 00:01:07,671
Upload.

42
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,504
We gotta get going.

43
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:11,508
We gotta have a blast
on the last day of 2017.

44
00:01:11,508 --> 00:01:13,503
Yes, today is December 31,

45
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:15,579
the last day of 2017.

46
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,962
So we've got to end it on
a great note, right guys?

47
00:01:17,962 --> 00:01:18,819
- [Jared] All right, kids.

48
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,905
We're about to take you
somewhere very, very special.

49
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:23,484
Do you know where we are?

50
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,243
- Pioneer Mountain?

51
00:01:25,243 --> 00:01:26,243
- No, wrong.

52
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,250
We are on the Planet Mars.

53
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:34,961
We're on Mars, and we're gonna
go explore the floor of Mars.

54
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:35,794
- Let's go.

55
00:01:35,794 --> 00:01:37,074
- [Jared] Go, let's go, let's go.

56
00:01:37,074 --> 00:01:39,046
(Laughing)

57
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:40,831
Lets leave the kids
here and say (mumbles).

58
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:42,329
(laughing)

59
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:44,942
Uncle Jarrod smoked his
peyote this morning.

60
00:01:44,942 --> 00:01:46,289
We had a great morning.

61
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,213
It was good.

62
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,564
And now we're gonna go have fun on Mars.

63
00:01:49,564 --> 00:01:51,667
Okay, okay, so this is
called Pioneer Park,

64
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:55,900
it's this beautiful red rock
area that looks like Mars.

65
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,813
We were here a while
ago with Carl and Ginger

66
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,454
and we're taking the rest of the family

67
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:01,646
to go look at it and see all of the cool

68
00:02:01,646 --> 00:02:04,410
rocks, the formations,
and explore a little bit.

69
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,993
(upbeat music)

70
00:02:22,305 --> 00:02:25,138
(music continues)

71
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,388
- I see the city!

72
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,215
(upbeat music)

73
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:25,174
(laughing)

74
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:29,341
- [Jared] So now we know how
to keep Calvin entertained.

75
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:34,548
(Laughing)

76
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,632
- [Brunette] Here you go, old friend.

77
00:03:36,632 --> 00:03:37,671
- [Jared] I'm bringing it back to ya.

78
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:39,704
- [Joel] Hey Cody, this thing
keeps running away from you.

79
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,302
- Next on the agenda is

80
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:42,462
the most uncomfortable place

81
00:03:42,462 --> 00:03:44,596
I have ever been in my entire life.

82
00:03:44,596 --> 00:03:46,321
Literally thought I was going to get

83
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,911
caught between a rock
and a hard spot and die.

84
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:49,824
Do you want to do it with me, Joel?

85
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,603
- I would like to get caught
in a rock and a hard spot.

86
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:56,360
- So just around this corner
over here, is a rock pass

87
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,478
and you have to shimmy your
way all the way through

88
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:00,402
and it gets tighter,
and tighter, and tighter

89
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:02,722
'till the very end when
it finally opens up.

90
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:06,078
We've done this before, and
that was about five pounds ago

91
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,558
so I don't know how this is gonna be today

92
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,590
but we're gonna give it a shot.

93
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,612
Are you gonna do it, Ellie?

94
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:12,875
- [Ellie] Yes.

95
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:13,708
- [Jared] You are?

96
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,334
- Last time I had Calvin strapped to me

97
00:04:15,334 --> 00:04:16,553
so totally I can go through.

98
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:18,752
- [Jared] So it starts out perfect,

99
00:04:18,753 --> 00:04:20,470
and then the more you go,

100
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,584
it gets narrower and
narrower and narrower.

101
00:04:24,584 --> 00:04:25,417
- Ooh!

102
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:31,969
I'm gonna give this brown
glassy shell to mommy.

103
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:35,508
- [Jared] Let's see it.

104
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,112
Oh, fun. Yeah.

105
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:38,999
- [Jackson] I got you one.

106
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,831
- [Ellie] You did?

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,726
- It might be broken glass, I'm not sure

108
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:45,476
but it's the thought that counts.

109
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,637
Stay right there by the side.

110
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:54,211
- [Brunette] I'm sorry I'm chickening out,

111
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,199
but I can't do this.

112
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,631
- [Ellie] It's a little intense.

113
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,077
I don't know if I can either.

114
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,046
- [Brunette] Yeah, I
feel a little anxious.

115
00:05:01,046 --> 00:05:02,040
- [Jared] Wait boys, wait.

116
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,075
Jackson, stop right there, please.

117
00:05:03,075 --> 00:05:05,789
- [Ellie] Okay Mama's Turn.

118
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:08,543
- [Jared] Watch your
head, watch it, watch it.

119
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:10,323
- [Ellie] How does
anyone fit through that?

120
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:11,796
- [Jared] Do you see that?

121
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:14,511
That's what we're gonna
try and go through.

122
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,774
Watch daddy go first okay?

123
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:16,627
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

124
00:05:16,627 --> 00:05:17,460
This is intense.

125
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,631
Okay go.

126
00:05:18,631 --> 00:05:21,082
- [Calvin] Daddy, I'm very nervous.

127
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:23,434
- [Jared] Okay come this way.

128
00:05:23,434 --> 00:05:25,145
- [Joel] You doin okay Cody?

129
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:27,235
- These kids are walking
sideways through this.

130
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:28,793
- [Ellie] Kay, if you guys have any issues

131
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,826
with claustrophobia,

132
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:31,780
this is it.
- When you get

133
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,305
to this tight spot, your gonna get out.

134
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:35,664
This is crazy.

135
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:36,671
- [Jared] You gotta wait just a second.

136
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:37,504
- This is crazy.

137
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,617
- [Jared] You gotta
let them go first Kyle.

138
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:42,322
- I could see how my mom
could have panic attacks.

139
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:43,280
I don't know...

140
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,895
Like its getting narrower Jared.

141
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:47,532
I'm literally not looking ahead.

142
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:48,449
Oh my hell.

143
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:50,778
(chuckles)

144
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:52,130
- [Jared] Are you doing good?

145
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,297
- I can see why people
have freakin panic attacks.

146
00:05:57,368 --> 00:05:59,097
Oh my hell.

147
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,722
Oh my gosh.

148
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:01,639
Oh my hell.

149
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:03,364
- [Jared] You need my hand?

150
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,447
Grab my hand.

151
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:07,182
Yeah.

152
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:08,799
- [Jackson] No I can do it.

153
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:10,799
- [Jared] Good job guys.

154
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,606
Here's the big spot.

155
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,339
We're almost all the way out.

156
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:16,571
You guys doing okay?

157
00:06:16,571 --> 00:06:18,502
- [Jackson] Yeah, we're doing okay.

158
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:19,503
- Oh that's good Jackson.

159
00:06:19,503 --> 00:06:21,553
I'm glad you're doing okay.

160
00:06:21,553 --> 00:06:23,559
- [Ellie] Mom will never do this again.

161
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:24,511
(chuckles)

162
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,440
- [Jared] Well you won't be able to

163
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,017
with your pregnant belly
getting in the way.

164
00:06:27,017 --> 00:06:28,564
Oh my gosh the camera not...

165
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:29,538
- [Bystander] You doing okay?

166
00:06:29,538 --> 00:06:30,777
- The camera's too wide.

167
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,272
- [Ellie] You can do it.

168
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,791
- [Jared] Open your hand.

169
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,042
There you go good job.

170
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:36,937
- [Ellie] Holy crap.

171
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:38,020
- [Jared] You're doing good?

172
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,476
- [Jackson] Yes doing good.

173
00:06:39,476 --> 00:06:40,336
- [Jared] Kay.

174
00:06:40,336 --> 00:06:41,169
- [Joel] I don't know.

175
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:42,002
I got caught in my chest at one spot.

176
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:46,169
That was the only spot where
I got tight around my chest.

177
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:48,775
- [Jared] (chuckles) I
can't believe they're

178
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,071
walking side ways like that.

179
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,672
(chuckles)

180
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:52,942

181
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:54,949
I am getting squished.

182
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,883
I just gotta stand up a little up here.

183
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:59,633
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

184
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:01,960
Okay there we go.

185
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,482
- [Ellie] Like why are we even doing this?

186
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,239
- [Jared] Okay Calvin give me your hand.

187
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,252
Oh you got it.

188
00:07:06,252 --> 00:07:08,085
You are doing so good.

189
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,802
- [Ellie] Are you scared or is this fun?

190
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:12,824
- [Jakson] Fun.

191
00:07:12,824 --> 00:07:13,991
- [Ellie] Fun.

192
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:18,579
I can see bird poop all over there.

193
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:25,394
- [Joel] The worst part is
when you can't turn your head.

194
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:26,813
That makes me anxious.

195
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:27,921
- Oh yeah.

196
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:29,276
When you're literally stuck.

197
00:07:29,276 --> 00:07:32,593
My mom has never liked tight spaces

198
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:34,264
and I've never cared

199
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:37,408
but to be honest I Feel
like since having Calvin

200
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:40,931
my body has become just different.

201
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:43,431
Like I used to love this stuff

202
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,518

207
00:07:51,613 --> 00:07:53,863

208
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:57,465

210
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,579

226
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,703
(laughing)

227
00:08:33,703 --> 00:08:36,063
I feel like I want to cry
cuz I just accomplished that.

228
00:08:36,063 --> 00:08:36,973
(laughing)

229
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,111
Sounds dramatic but it really was...

230
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:39,241
- [Jared] Oh my gosh Lincolns here.

231
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,074

All the way.

239
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:53,618
That was intense.

240
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:54,827
I've never done that before.

241
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,326
Last time I was here.

242
00:08:56,326 --> 00:08:58,825
