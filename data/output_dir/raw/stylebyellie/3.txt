1
00:00:00,364 --> 00:00:03,614
(light tinkling music)

2
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:22,496
- [Jackson] No, no.

3
00:00:22,496 --> 00:00:24,283
We can't Easter yet.

4
00:00:24,283 --> 00:00:27,420
Calvin, we can't Easter yet.

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,087
We can't Easter yet.

6
00:00:30,004 --> 00:00:32,254
(mumbling)

7
00:00:33,139 --> 00:00:34,806
We can't Easter yet.

8
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:41,545
Calvin.

9
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:46,298
- [Ellie] Good Morning.

10
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,228
[Ellie] Hi Jackson.
- Is it Easter?

11
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:50,934
- [Ellie And Jared] It is!

12
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,184
- What is that?

13
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,862
- [Jared] Did you get your Easter Eggs?

14
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:58,987
- [Ellie] Calvin put it all in his bucket.

15
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:01,159
- [Jared] Yeah. Jackson, do
you want to go get your bucket,

16
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,253
and put all the eggs in there?

17
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,830
- Why did you get these?

18
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:09,240
- [Jared] Oh, those are
from the Easter Bunny.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,407
- What's this?

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,957
- [Ellie] Wow.

21
00:01:12,957 --> 00:01:15,707
- [Jared] Does that look so cool?

22
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:17,687
- But what is it?
(Calvin mumbling)

23
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:19,910
- [Ellie] It looks like
a board to color on,

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,440
like at church and stuff.

25
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,908
- [Jared] Yeah.

26
00:01:22,908 --> 00:01:23,741
- Look a golden egg.

27
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:25,764
- [Jared] What!

28
00:01:25,764 --> 00:01:28,760
- Filled with gummy bears.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,197
- [Ellie] Whoa.

30
00:01:30,197 --> 00:01:31,030
- Oooh.

31
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,550
what's this?

32
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,690
- [Jared] That looks like--

33
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:39,660
- A phone.

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,544
- [Jared] A phone?

35
00:01:40,544 --> 00:01:42,920
(gasps) A phone for Easter.

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,070
- [Ellie] Just for you.

37
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,560
I think it looks like a toothbrush.

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,530
- [Jared] It looks like a toothbrush

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,194
like mommy and daddy's, for you.

40
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,959
(gasps) Calvin, you know what that is.

41
00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:52,882
- Bath bomb!

42
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:53,787
- [Jared] A bath bomb.

43
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:55,474
You gonna go get your bucket?

44
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:56,350
- Yeah!

45
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,183
- [Jared] Okay.

46
00:01:58,293 --> 00:01:59,780
- There's eggs there.
(Calvin mumbling)

47
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,330
- [Jared] There is?

48
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,977
- I think it's funny that Jackson

49
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,759
didn't want to pick up the eggs.

50
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,592
- [Jared] Yeah, he wanted-

51
00:02:06,592 --> 00:02:07,425
- He came to ask.

52
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,919
- [Jared] He wanted to make sure first.

53
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,149
- It's downstairs.

54
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,800
- [Jared] Those swimming goggles.

55
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,424
- These goggles, swimming goggles.

56
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,680
- [Jared] Yeah.

57
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,930
- It's so full.

58
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,014
Hey, why are there eggs up there?

59
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,038
- [Jared] Is there
something else over there?

60
00:02:29,038 --> 00:02:30,473
- [Ellie] It leads to something.

61
00:02:30,473 --> 00:02:32,010
- [Jared] Why don't
you go follow the eggs?

62
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,860
Grab your bucket and follow the eggs.

63
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,933
What's this over here?

64
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,850
What does that look like?

65
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,240
- [Ellie] Let's open up our eggs,

66
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,790
it looks like it goes to this.

67
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,846
- [Jared] Yeah, there's
letters on the inside.

68
00:02:48,846 --> 00:02:49,679
- [Ellie] What is that?

69
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:52,570
Your little flowers sprouted
just in time for Easter.

70
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,145
- [Jared] Yes, they did! Look at that.

71
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:58,008
- [Ellie] I can't wait
until they grow, bloom.

72
00:02:58,008 --> 00:03:00,802
- Now let's open our eggs.

73
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:01,880
- [Jared] Yeah, let's
see what's in your eggs.

74
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,040
- I'm going to open this one.

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,290
- [Jared And Ellie] Okay.

76
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:07,049
- Open this one.

77
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:07,882
- A X!

78
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:10,822
- [Jared] An X? Oh my goodness.

79
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:13,641
- [Ellie] Where does it go?

80
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:14,724
- Nope, this.

81
00:03:16,023 --> 00:03:17,800
- [Jared] Does it go right there?

82
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,633
- Yeah.

83
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,466
- [Ellie] Oh cool!

84
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:20,660
Calvin, what did you get?

85
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,630
- [Calvin] Oh!

86
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,620
- [Ellie] You got an O?

87
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,370
- [Jared] Uh, G.

88
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,203
- [Ellie] G.

89
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:28,425
- Calvin, it goes right here.

90
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:30,143
Now I'm gonna open this one.

91
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:33,270
- [Ellie] Okay, I think
it was so silly Jackson,

92
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,103
that you let--

93
00:03:34,103 --> 00:03:35,176
- I got an S!

94
00:03:35,176 --> 00:03:37,012
- That you didn't want
to pick up the eggs.

95
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:39,069
- [Jared] I know, that was kind of sweet.

96
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,257
- And sad.
- I got an S.

97
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:44,376
- [Jared] Find the one that
looks just like that one.

98
00:03:44,376 --> 00:03:45,209
- This.

99
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,350
- [Jared] Yeah, find the same one.

100
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,947
- [Ellie] Q, it's the lowercase Q.

101
00:03:49,947 --> 00:03:51,864
- It says Q, it says Q.

102
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,579
- [Jared] Yeah, Q.

103
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,441
- I got a sneeze for Easter.

104
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:59,537
- Oh my god, you got a big sneeze.

105
00:03:59,537 --> 00:04:01,362
- [Ellie] Blow, blow.

106
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:02,863
- Let's wipe and now blow.

107
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:06,113
(Calming guitar music)

108
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,063
- Okay, I've got it.

109
00:04:48,063 --> 00:04:49,760
- [Jared] You've got it?

110
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,711
Good job!

111
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, you found the last
one, you finished it.

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,833
Good job, bud.

113
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,380
- See, this mess.

114
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,620
- [Jared] Look at this
mess, all of these eggs

115
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,727
had all of those things in it.

116
00:05:01,727 --> 00:05:04,113
And you guys did it together, good job!

117
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,587
- [Voice On TV] Every true
disciple of Jesus Christ.

118
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,930
- We are sitting here together as a family

119
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,760
watching General Conference.

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,140
It's all about inspiring
and uplifting talks.

121
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,750
We're just hanging out as a family.

122
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,440
Hey, your dress sure looks pretty.

123
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,740
- Thank you, I was looking at Jack's.

124
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,743
- Happy Easter bud.

125
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,140
Fist bump.

126
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,173
Happy Easter! (laughs)

127
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,690
Conference is now over
and it was wonderful.

128
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,390
We had a bunch of hours in front of the TV

129
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,972
listening to uplifting
and inspiring messages

130
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:43,340
and it was great.

131
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,290
But we've been sitting for a long time,

132
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,930
and now I think it's the perfect time

133
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,890
to go outside and get moving.

134
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,290
We've got a bunch of eggs in this bag

135
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,690
that I'm going to hide and
a couple of jackpot eggs.

136
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,740
And we're going to have the kids

137
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,990
go look for them and find them.

138
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,780
I mean, is it really Easter
without an Easter egg hunt?

139
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,590
See if I can get the
door with all this stuff.

140
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,100
Penny, hey sister, are
you going to help me

141
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,740
hide all these eggs, huh?

142
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,500
Or are you going to
sneak some for yourself?

143
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,285
I feel like you're the sneaky type.

144
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,118
Whoa!

145
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:13,910
Need I say more?

146
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,110
Hey! No peeking!

147
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,820
Calvin, go get your bucket.

148
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,680
Silly pants.

149
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,890
- Whoa!

150
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,580
- [Jared] Don't, no, no,
no peeking, no peeking.

151
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,623
Go get your bucket.

152
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:23,634
(Calvin mumbling)

153
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:24,810
Yeah, you see one?

154
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,350
Go get it, go get your boots on.

155
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,470
Jackson, you got your boots on?

156
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,800
- Is it cold?

157
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,220
- [Jared] Uh, it's windy.

158
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,040
But when it's not windy it's good.

159
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,330
You got your boots, you got your bucket.

160
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,459
- Thumbs up, fist bump. (pow)

161
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:37,292
Ow.

162
00:06:37,292 --> 00:06:38,970
- Sorry, did my ring get ya?
- Yeah.

163
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,803
- Let's try it again.

164
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:40,801
This hand.

165
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,061
Better?

166
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:42,894
Dodododaloo.

167
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:44,233
- I think I could do this. (pow)

168
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:47,760
- Dododaloo, 'kay, let's get
our coats on and rock and roll.

169
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,050
On your mark.

170
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,920
Wait are you ready?

171
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,926
Mom, are you ready?

172
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:51,759
- I'm ready.

173
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:52,592
- Are you ready kids?

174
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:53,530
- Yeah!

175
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,197
- On your mark, get set, go!

176
00:06:57,216 --> 00:07:00,000
(cheerful music)

177
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,100
I love that you pass.

178
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,120
Oh, oh, oh my goodness.

179
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,690
I don't know if... (laughs)

180
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,280
Our tree's too little. (laughs)

181
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,473
That was good Jackson, going
for the difficult ones first.

182
00:07:16,453 --> 00:07:19,953
(eggs rattling in bucket)

183
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:22,847
- [Ellie] I love this.

184
00:07:22,847 --> 00:07:24,357
(kids Yelling)

185
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:27,107
(cheerful music)

186
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,164
- Whoa, egg, egg.

187
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:05,752
I found an egg.

188
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,977
- [Jackson] I found a pink one here.

189
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:12,894
- This egg.

190
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:16,872
- [Ellie] This is our first
Easter egg hunt in our backyard.

191
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,140
- [Jared] It is! That's so fun.

192
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,770
We've got some really good
hiding places, don't we?

193
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,720
As the kids get older.
- [Ellie] Yeah.

194
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,718
- Wow! Favorite egg!

195
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:36,961
- [Ellie] (laughs) Why does
that make me laugh so hard?

196
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:41,024
- [Jared] It's so sweet.
- What!

197
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:45,018
- [Jared] You found it.

198
00:08:48,588 --> 00:08:50,947
- You want to put it here?

199
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,106
It's too big, what are
you going to do with it.

200
00:08:55,106 --> 00:08:57,356
(laughter)

201
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,386
- [Jared] That's one way to crack it open.

202
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:06,636
- What's in it?

203
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,418
- Captain America.

204
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,251
- [Jared] Captain America.

205
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,501
- And Go fish! We'll play this today.

206
00:09:14,501 --> 00:09:16,735
- What's in my bag.

207
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,082
- [Jared] 'kay, go get it!

208
00:09:19,082 --> 00:09:20,082
- Which one?

209
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,523
- [Jared] Go, go, go, this way!

210
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,356
This way!

211
00:09:28,724 --> 00:09:30,557
- He said go this way.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,890
- [Jackson] He's not doing it.

213
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,467
- [Jared] He doesn't see it.

214
00:09:38,467 --> 00:09:40,040
(Ellie laughs)

215
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,260
Jackson sees it from all the way up there.

216
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,020
Uh oh, Jackson's going to get it

217
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,018
and see it before Calvin does.

218
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:47,851
- There's a big egg!

219
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:49,227
- [Jared] It's right there Calvin.

220
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:51,016
(laughs) It's right there.

221
00:09:51,016 --> 00:09:53,266
(laughing)

222
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,200
Jackson's going to get it before you do!

223
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,417
Hurry! Run! Run!

224
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,032
- No, I don't want that egg.

225
00:10:05,032 --> 00:10:07,453
- [Jared] You don't want it?

226
00:10:07,453 --> 00:10:09,573
- You can have it then.

227
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:11,823
- Yay! I got two jack eggs!

228
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,153
- [Jared] You didn't want the big one?

229
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,823
You want the little eggs?

230
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:25,787
I guess the thing about kids
is they always surprise you.

231
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:28,230
You would think that they
would want the biggest eggs

232
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,630
but Calvin's like, nope,
I want the little eggs.

233
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,353
Happy Easter.

234
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:43,310
- Happy Easter!

235
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,709
- I sure love you.

236
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:45,542
- I love you too.

237
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:47,001
I love that we get to do an
Easter egg hunt in our backyard.

238
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:48,810
- I can't believe this is the first one.

239
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,660
- I know.

240
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,550
- It's pretty great.

241
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,670
You remember last year when
we did the paint up there--

242
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,219
- It was fun.
- With all the dirt.

243
00:10:54,219 --> 00:10:56,170
Full of mud though.
- It was so much fun.

244
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,003
It was great.

245
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:57,836
I loved it.

246
00:10:57,836 --> 00:10:58,669
I'll have that video link down below

247
00:10:58,669 --> 00:10:59,841

248
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:01,720
- (laughing) Next year we're
going to have a little one.

249
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,553
- Oh my goodness.

250
00:11:02,553 --> 00:11:03,585
- Another little, little, little one.

251
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:05,450
Wearing my Bali dress today.

252
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,400
- It's beautiful.

253
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,710
- From our website, and it's so comfy.

254
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,680
I love this out here.

255
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,973
- Yeah, it's really nice.

256
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:13,644
I love you.

257
00:11:13,644 --> 00:11:14,967
- I love you.

258
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,800
(crack)

259
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,633
[Ellie]: You got it.

260
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,420
[Jared]: Whoa! Jackpot.

261
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,570
- I got Hulk! Look!

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,130
- [Jared] Do you guys love this?

263
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,080
Look at all these.

264
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,630
- The Jack egg, you got
Go Fish and you got I Spy.

265
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,710
'Cause Calvin didn't want the Jack egg.

266
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,560
- [Jared] Which is so
funny, he like saw it,

267
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,490
but just didn't want it because
he wanted the tiny eggs.

268
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,323
- Jack egg.

269
00:11:36,312 --> 00:11:38,790
- [Jared] : Okay. Whoa.

270
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,880
Well, do you think we're
good on candy for a while?

271
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,265
- I think we're great.
- Yeah.

272
00:11:42,265 --> 00:11:44,318
- I like, want to do that again.

273
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,651
- I know.
- Dang.

274
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:48,750
Easter egg hunts are so magical.

275
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,900
- They are, they are a lot of fun.

276
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,540
We had a wonderful day celebrating Easter,

277
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,930
spending time as a a family

278
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,800
listening to General Conference.

279
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,860
Spending time with family as
we did an Easter egg hunt.

280
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,290
Easter's a very special time for us.

281
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,940
Not only being with family

282
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,930
but, our hearts and our
minds, and our spirits.

283
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,800
So, we hope you had a wonderful day today.

284
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,760
I hope you enjoyed the same day upload,

285
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,520
and we will see you guys next time.

286
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,203
Say goodbye everyone! Say Happy Easter!

287
00:12:15,203 --> 00:00:00,000
