1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,210
- It's show and tell
and I'm bringing this.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,950
- [Ellie] That looks awesome.

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,330
Your Ultimate Garage rocket ship.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,750
Okay, can you go put
that in your book bag?

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,420
Can you go do that?

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,680
Your back pack, book bag,

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,930
I call it one thing, Dad calls it another.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:20,780
We have a busy morning ahead of us.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,570
And this mister, I don't
know if it's just taking him

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,020
a minute to wake up or
if he doesn't feel well.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,560
His color looks like it came back.

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,020
He looked a little pale this morning,

13
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,940
but he is just waking up.

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,410
When I was at Bonnie's, I was saying

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,430
how I was a little nervous

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,782
for my doctor appointment today,

17
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:38,020
because Jared's not here

18
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,440
and they're doing an ultrasound

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,510
and I just still kind of have some nerves.

20
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,410
And my mom overheard me and she's like,

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,610
I'll come, she's like
I'll be there, when is it?

22
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,443
Nine o'clock?

23
00:00:46,443 --> 00:00:47,276
I'll drive up.

24
00:00:47,276 --> 00:00:48,640
And I'm like okay.

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,780
So my mom's gonna be here any minute.

26
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:53,350
We're gonna go to my doctor's appointment,

27
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,380
we got lots of errands,

28
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,730
I have a chiropractor appointment.

29
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,520
It's gonna be a great day.

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,290
I have noticed a huge difference

31
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,430
with going to a chiropractor,

32
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:05,459
like my neck, my head, everything
has felt so much better,

33
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,370
so I'm really glad that she was able

34
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,780
to get me in so fast a few weeks ago

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,430
and that I've been able to continue to go.

36
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,920
Whoa.

37
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,990
It fit all in there.

38
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,890
That's awesome.

39
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:20,030
- But I need to drink my juice still.

40
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,350
- [Ellie] Okay go drink your
juice and get your shoes on.

41
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,183
- Okay.

42
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,016
- I can't believe it.

43
00:01:24,016 --> 00:01:25,360
He gets dressed in the mornings,

44
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,390
he gets his shoes on.

45
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,750
It's amazing.

46
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,310
It's amazing how you're being able

47
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,270
to be a little bit more independent, huh?

48
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,320
What are you thinking?

49
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,220
Oh that's a smile.

50
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,977
That's the first smile I've seen on him.

51
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,790
(Ellie laughs)

52
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,910
Okay, change of plans.

53
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,750
Mister is definitely showing signs

54
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,678
that he would want to throw up, huh Mom?

55
00:01:46,678 --> 00:01:47,810
- Yes.

56
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,635
- [Ellie] Well we're only gonna
stay for just a few minutes.

57
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:52,468
(sighs)

58
00:01:52,468 --> 00:01:53,670
- Today's the day, let's do it.

59
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,670
Did you just thumbs up
yourself in the mirror?

60
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,650
You bet I did.

61
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,420
Today is the day that I have
my speaking event with DJI.

62
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,080
If I'm being completely honest,

63
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,330
I'm a little nervous.

64
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,430
But not terribly nervous,

65
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,490
because I feel like
what I'm speaking about

66
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,323
is what I know.

67
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:10,300
It's something that I know,

68
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,133
something that I feel,

69
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:12,420
something that I believe in,

70
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,210
so I'm excited about it.

71
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,310
The issue is (laughs),

72
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,040
I waited 45 minutes for a taxi,

73
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,190
no Ubers were available.

74
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:24,322
It took 45 minutes to get
from the hotel to here

75
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:26,360
and I hopped out of my taxi

76
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,740
so I could walk the rest of the way,

77
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,040
because look, I'm going faster

78
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,700
than these cars right now.

79
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,650
This is insane.

80
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,150
The taxi that I hopped out of,

81
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,325
is like a block and a half away already.

82
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,430
(laughs)

83
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,010
- Calvin is going into a four hour nap.

84
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,370
Can you believe that?

85
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,180
Mom put him to bed.

86
00:02:46,178 --> 00:02:49,190
- He's still laying
like he was when I left.

87
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,023
- He so tired.

88
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,640
Look a the gravy.

89
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,730
Mom just gave me a huge thumbs up, yay.

90
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,890
- Mmm-hmm, you're gonna
do it for the book.

91
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,370
- You're gonna do it.
- Yay.

92
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,540
- I got a roast, got her carrots,

93
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,860
we're having lunch.

94
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,660
If Jared was here, I would fix the camera.

95
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,050
I think the settings are off.

96
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,370
I can just tell as I'm moving it,

97
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,730
so, sorry Jared, he'll
have to fix it tomorrow.

98
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,660
I don't know how to do the settings,

99
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,310
but Mom just gave me approval on my roast.

100
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,220
- Big thumbs up.

101
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,410
- And as Calvin is sleeping,

102
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,350
Mom and I have just been talking.

103
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:23,522
And she just gave, I was
like you should tweet that.

104
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:26,370
She just gave the most
inspirational saying.

105
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,520
We were just talking about life

106
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,130
and just to enjoy it,

107
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,030
and she's like you need to just enjoy

108
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,490
the moment you're in, no
matter the phase of life

109
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,040
you're in or whatever job you have,

110
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
you need to enjoy it, because,

111
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,670
do you remember what you said?

112
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,040
- I can't remember what I said.

113
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,780
- She said because when you get there,

114
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,120
wherever there is, she goes,
you might not get there,

115
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
just be happy with what you're doing.

116
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,280
Be happy with where you're at.

117
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,359
- Yeah.

118
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,192
- You said even with you,

119
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,730
you're like, I don't
know where the end is,

120
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,750
or that light point is,
- Yeah yeah.

121
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,300
- just be happy,

122
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,750
so I liked that, good job.

123
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,430
- So I made it into the convention center.

124
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:58,110
We are here at CES.

125
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,460
And I got my badge and everything

126
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,293
and I'm ready to go.

127
00:04:00,293 --> 00:04:02,910
But the hardest part about CES is finding

128
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,690
exactly where you need to go.

129
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:05,980
There are so many floors,

130
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,070
there's an east, a west, a north, a south,

131
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,890
exhibit hall and so many booths,

132
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,770
so I'm gonna have to check out this map

133
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,890
and see where I need to go.

134
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,723
Three.

135
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,439
Already found out, I
am on the wrong floor.

136
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,273
That was quick.

137
00:04:21,273 --> 00:04:23,550
Oh my goodness gracious.

138
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,850
Home sweet home.

139
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,320
This is what kinda makes me nervous.

140
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,190
Look at this crowd that I'm
going to be speaking to.

141
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,660
- [Ellie] Somebody woke up
with a smile on his face.

142
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,353
Are you happy?

143
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,103
Were you sick?

144
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,600
You slept from nine to 1:30.

145
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,433
Are you tired?

146
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:45,690
(Ellie laughs)

147
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,740
You look better, Cal.

148
00:04:49,517 --> 00:04:51,110
You got some rosiness to your cheeks,

149
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,310
but you still look pale.

150
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,860
Hi.

151
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,963
You're at those chairs again.

152
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,442
- Yeah, I just rode in
one of those chairs.

153
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:01,138
- [Ellie] I have a question for you.

154
00:05:01,138 --> 00:05:02,210
- Sure.

155
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,660
- [Ellie] Am I okay to open this?

156
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,230
- Yeah, yes, you can open it!

157
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,850
I got you a little surprise Ellie.

158
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,850
- [Ellie] Thank you.

159
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:14,120
- You're so welcome.

160
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,660
- [Ellie] That's cute.

161
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,390
- Yeah, so darnit I kinda wish I was there

162
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,223
to do this with you,

163
00:05:20,223 --> 00:05:22,130
but do you want me to explain it?

164
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,963
- [Ellie] Sure.

165
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:25,590
- Okay so what this is, every month

166
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,170
you will get a box

167
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:31,030
and inside that box, it's all based around

168
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,177
what you're feeling right now,

169
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:34,290
how far along in your
pregnancy you are right now.

170
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,520
So you're 15 weeks right now,

171
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,590
so this box is all catered to you

172
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,640
being 15 weeks pregnant.

173
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,473
- [Ellie] Yay.

174
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,960
- And then next month
you'll get another one

175
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,670
that's like 20 weeks pregnant

176
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,700
and all that sort of thing.

177
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,100
So it's based on that kind of stuff.

178
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,120
So you get a present every single month

179
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,270
to help you get through your pregnancy.

180
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,330
- [Ellie] That sounds really fun and cute.

181
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,163
- I love you so much.

182
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:53,714
- [Ellie] Thanks.

183
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:54,720
- You're so welcome.

184
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,180
- [Ellie] That's like a fun surprise.

185
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,420
- Yeah and how cool is it that it came

186
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,860
on a day that you got your ultrasound.

187
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,910
- [Ellie] It was perfect, thank you.

188
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,520
- You're so welcome.

189
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,353
I love you so much,

190
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,830
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.

191
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,020
- [Ellie] I didn't want
to open it if you don't

192
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:07,860
want me to, so.

193
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,960
- Oh no, you go ahead and open it

194
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,793
and you enjoy it.

195
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:11,626
- [Ellie] Okay, thanks.

196
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:14,190
- Take a picture of
what's inside and show me.

197
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,023
- [Ellie] Okay I will.

198
00:06:15,023 --> 00:06:15,980
- Love you, bye bye.

199
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,640
- Well I thought that
was so cute of Jared.

200
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,010
Like two weeks ago, he's like,

201
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,350
don't look at the bank account,

202
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:22,170
and I was like, he never tells me not

203
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,051
to look at the bank account.

204
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:25,570
And so, thank you so much Jared.

205
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,620
And what a fun surprise to do it on today.

206
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,930
So baby is--

207
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,530
I'm 16 weeks.

208
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,630
Baby boy is the size of an avocado

209
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,720
and he can start to hear my voice.

210
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,530
He's growing his eyelashes
and his eyebrows this week

211
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,800
and he's forming his taste buds.

212
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,060
Is that cute or what?

213
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,200
Mom's doing my dishes.

214
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,033
Why are you so cute?

215
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:47,170
- Well I'm sitting here talking to you,

216
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,003
I thought you were talking to me

217
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,070
and I looked up and you're
filming and I went oh.

218
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,980
- No you're so cute.

219
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,950
I'm talking to you too.

220
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,850
And so I'm really excited to open this box

221
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,370
from what he told me.

222
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,520
I get one once a month.

223
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,010
How cute are you?

224
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,020
To Mom.

225
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,220
Cute.

226
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,460
Relax, we've got you covered.

227
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,721
This is better than going
to get a maternity massage.

228
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:13,554
(Ellie laughs)

229
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:15,350
So the boxes are 60 bucks,

230
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,690
it has a mask, a cosmetic bag,

231
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,550
a body wash, a little loofah,

232
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,681
wooden massager, yes, fun and some snacks.

233
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:30,280
Oh cute.

234
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,060
That is so cute Jared, thank you.

235
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,580
A little loofah, yes.

236
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,064
And a mask.

237
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:43,064
(gasps)

238
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,330
And a back massager.

239
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,850
Little did he know,

240
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,810
is he's gonna give me a
back massage tomorrow,

241
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,270
he probably didn't even know.

242
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,950
A little cosmetic bag

243
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,690
and body wash, which is perfect,

244
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:01,925
because I've been using his the last week.

245
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:05,100
Mom this is so cute.

246
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,170
Thank you Jared.

247
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,393
I seriously can't wait for next month.

248
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:10,520
This is like the cutest thing

249
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:13,042
to get for your wife, thank you.

250
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,240
Like I said, this is better
than a maternity massage.

251
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,270
I was thinking of maybe going to get one

252
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,630
and then I was like, no,
Jared will just rub my back.

253
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,940
I'll have him rub my feet.

254
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,230
This is fun.

255
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,160
Thank you.

256
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,710
This is the face and body mask.

257
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,240
It looks awesome.

258
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,910
And this body wash smells so good.

259
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,077
It has a very light mint
slash, yep, melon scent.

260
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,960
And that's exactly what it is.

261
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,890
And it definitely is a melon scent,

262
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,730
but it also is a spearmint,

263
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,563
like it's minty.

264
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:44,930
It's amazing.

265
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,820
Seriously, I'm so excited.

266
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,840
- I forgot to mention this

267
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,350
when I was talking about
being in a taxi earlier today.

268
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,290
The coolest thing about CES and being here

269
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,600
is you never know who
you're gonna be next to.

270
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,690
When I was in the taxi, I
actually shared the taxi

271
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:01,560
with someone and he was from Volkswagen

272
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,870
and he was talking to me
about the autonomous vehicles

273
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,080
that they are presenting today.

274
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,710
And I just thought that
was the craziest thing,

275
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,940
like we just so happened to
be sharing a cab together.

276
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,860
This little dad YouTuber
and a guy at Volkswagen

277
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,935
talking about autonomous vehicles.

278
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,710
That's the coolest thing
about these conventions.

279
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,583
You never know who
you're gonna be next to,

280
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,510
who you're having a conversation with

281
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,600
and who you're working on
your next project with.

282
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,150
And speaking of projects,

283
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,280
you never know who you're gonna meet

284
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,510
and what you're gonna do.

285
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,390
There's a couple cool cars behind us

286
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,200
and I think we might have some fun

287
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,180
with those cars here in just a second.

288
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,180
Ah, those are Teslas!

289
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,167
(growling)

290
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:50,167
(Calvin vocalizing)

291
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,761
(laughing)

292
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,070
- [Grandma] Dangit, we embarrassed him.

293
00:10:03,741 --> 00:10:05,773
- Look at his head above the couch.

294
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:10,464
Look at his head above the couch.

295
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:11,979
- I wanted a picture.

296
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:12,856
(laughing)

297
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:14,195
- Did you hear him?

298
00:10:14,195 --> 00:10:17,370
Yay.

299
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,010
- [Grandma] He was so cute.

300
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,360
- That was funny.

301
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,970
I did not think he was going

302
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,550
to run and hide.

303
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,050
He's a shy guy.

304
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,130
- Well I loved that you could see

305
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:30,440
his little head popping up
across the top of the couch.

306
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,530
That was so cute.

307
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,510
- [Ellie] Bonnie just came over.

308
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,760
We cut Mom's hair, it looks great,

309
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,010
trimmed it a little.

310
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,100
- And by we, she means I watched.

311
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,148
- [Ellie] I did it, it's okay.

312
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:40,981
(laughs)

313
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,120
- So we are back with Zack and Dan

314
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,330
and we met up with our
buddy Ben from Teslanomics.

315
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,530
And we've got two Tesla's here

316
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,090
and I'm kind of freaking out guys.

317
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,960
We've got a Model X and
a brand new Model 3.

318
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,740
If you didn't know, I have my eye

319
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,880
on the Model 3.

320
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,510
It's my dream car I guess right now.

321
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,510
So we're just gonna
drive around with these

322
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,343
for a little bit.

323
00:11:03,343 --> 00:11:04,710
Dan has a fun video in mind

324
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,460
for the Teslas and we're
just gonna have a good time.

325
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,890
- Why don't you get one already?

326
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,890
- [Jared] I want to.

327
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,066
- He doesn't like my
tweets ever, like ever.

328
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:16,020
But if I ever do anything with the Tesla,

329
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,710
he's like heart, liking it,

330
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,620
sometimes he comments
on it with heart emojis.

331
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,930
- It's like the cry face emoji,

332
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,290
like it's so beautiful, oh all that.

333
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,240
Ellie, I mean come on,

334
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,570
you're kind of the limiting factor here.

335
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:29,621
Maybe we can make something work.

336
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:30,580
(laughs)

337
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,040
So one thing that we're doing out here

338
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,609
in the desert of Nevada,

339
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,500
(car motoring)

340
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,530
is we're testing out the shocks

341
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,454
of the Model 3

342
00:11:37,454 --> 00:11:38,287
(car motoring)

343
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:40,370
which is right there,
and then the Model X.

344
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,030
The Model X has air suspension

345
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,120
and the Model 3 has coil suspension

346
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,688
and they've been driving by.

347
00:11:46,688 --> 00:11:47,521
(cars motoring)

348
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:48,354
It's been pretty cool.

349
00:11:48,354 --> 00:11:49,310
So how does it feel guys?

350
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,143
- It felt great.

351
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,720
It felt--
- Yeah?

352
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,090
- That was better.

353
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,923
- Yeah.

354
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:57,290
- So there is a quiz going around

355
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,890
that I shouldn't prompt you of what

356
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,723
I'm going to ask,

357
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:02,110
but I'm gonna ask you some questions okay?

358
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,560
First let's wipe your mouth.

359
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,160
Calvin are you coming up here?

360
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,120
Okay.
(playful music)

361
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,210
What makes Mommy happy?

362
00:12:12,749 --> 00:12:14,000
- Smiling.

363
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,833
- Smiling?

364
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:15,700
- Mmm-hmm.

365
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,540
- Yes.

366
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,440
What makes Mommy sad?

367
00:12:19,593 --> 00:12:21,030
(growling)

368
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,850
Oh when you do scary faces?

369
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:23,980
That does make me sad.

370
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,460
What is my favorite thing to do?

371
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,200
What does Mommy do a lot?

372
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:30,937
- Get ready.

373
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,128
- Get ready?

374
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:33,550
(laughing)

375
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:36,830
Yes, what is Mommy's favorite food?

376
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,380
Do you know what I eat a lot?

377
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,503
- Cereal.

378
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:41,409
- Cereal.

379
00:12:41,409 --> 00:12:44,282
What does Daddy drink a lot of?

380
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:45,395
- Dr. Pepper.

381
00:12:45,395 --> 00:12:47,070
- That's a good answer.

382
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,220
Do you know who my best friend is?

383
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,220
- Uh-huh.

384
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,400
- Who's my best friend?

385
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,233
- Philip's mom.

386
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,666
- Philip's mom?

387
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:55,499
(laughs)

388
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,640
- I mean Parks' mom.

389
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,617
- Park's mom Chelsea?

390
00:12:58,617 --> 00:12:59,450
- Uh-huh.

391
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,090
- Yeah, Chelsea's my good friend.

392
00:13:02,317 --> 00:13:03,150
That's cute.

393
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,520
If Mommy could go anywhere,

394
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,280
where would she go?

395
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,310
- Bonnie and Joel's.

396
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,820
- Bonnie and Joel's, that's a good answer.

397
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,140
Do you think you could live without me?

398
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,973
- Nope.

399
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:13,806
- Why?

400
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:15,940
- Because I want to stay at the house.

401
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,800
- Yeah, I want to stay at the house too.

402
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,310
How old am I?

403
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,620
- 13.

404
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,470
- I'm 13?

405
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,470
- Uh-huh.

406
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,260
- Okay, what is my favorite color?

407
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,170
- Pink and purple.

408
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,800
- Pink and purple.

409
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,740
And how much do you love me?

410
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,550
That much?

411
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,660
I love you so much.

412
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,060
- I love you badder.

413
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,890
- You love me badder?

414
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,950
Oh my goodness, I love you badder.

415
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,200
- I love you badder.

416
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,430
- I love you so much I
let you mix the batter

417
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,530
when we make pancakes.

418
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,662
(vibrating lips)
(laughing)

419
00:13:52,662 --> 00:13:54,100
I thought that would be a fun little

420
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,910
questions to ask Jackson

421
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,650
to see what his answers would be.

422
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,840
Some of those are really funny

423
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,140
and most of them were on point.

424
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,520
I am good friends with Chelsea,

425
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,030
I would like to go to
Bonnie and Joel's house.

426
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:08,581
Okay, let's do this again
in a few months, okay?

427
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,464
- Eeee.

428
00:14:09,464 --> 00:14:11,320
- Oh jeez, now's the time,

429
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,650
Ben is letting me drive it.

430
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,290
Oh this is the key.

431
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,110
This is the key to the Model 3.

432
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,040
It's a card, it's like a hotel card

433
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,539
and you just put it on there.

434
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,650
Okay I'm doing it.

435
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,200
I'm not even asking, I'm doing it.

436
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,500
He gave me permission, I'm doing it.

437
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,590
Okay, I'll drive the car,

438
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,830
you man the camera, how does that sound?

439
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,770
- [Ben] I will do my best.

440
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,480
- Alright okay.
- Do we want you?

441
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,594
- Oh my gosh, you're
so much taller than me.

442
00:14:33,594 --> 00:14:36,450
So you just take the key
and you put it right here?

443
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,520
- It's back here, I don't
know if you can really see it.

444
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,353
It's kinda dark,

445
00:14:39,353 --> 00:14:40,186
but that right there.
- There we go.

446
00:14:40,186 --> 00:14:41,250
- [Ben] And then you tap the breaks.

447
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,210
And then this is your shifter,

448
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,043
- Oh my gosh.

449
00:14:44,043 --> 00:14:45,900
- [Ben] So you just
push that down for drive

450
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,810
and then when we're done,
you just tap it in for park.

451
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,780
- Tap it in for park?
- Yeah.

452
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,710
- So there you go.
- Okay.

453
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,543
- Okay, we're good.

454
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:51,864
I'm gonna line up

455
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:53,250
and then I'm gonna take off.

456
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,270
The thing about Tesla cars, it's electric.

457
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,040
It's instant, it just goes.

458
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,270
There's no ramp up from the engine,

459
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,790
a combustion engine,

460
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,190
so I'm just checking my--

461
00:15:04,038 --> 00:15:05,130
(loud exhale)

462
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,030
Ready?

463
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,863
- [Ben] Let's do it.

464
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:07,980
- It's a Model 3, it's not that fast,

465
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,420
but this is still pretty fast.

466
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,890
- It's fast.
- Okay.

467
00:15:11,804 --> 00:15:13,854
- Whoa!

468
00:15:13,854 --> 00:15:16,370
(laughs)

469
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,453
Whoa dude, we only got up to 50.

470
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,740
(Ben laughing)

471
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,070
That was still really cool.

472
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,720
And you don't even hear anything.

473
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,440
That's awesome, oh my gosh.

474
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,520
Wow, this is amazing.

475
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,090
It feels good in my hands.

476
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,500
How does the horn sound?

477
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,357
- [Ben] I don't know.

478
00:15:30,357 --> 00:15:31,190
(honking)

479
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,681
- That's a good sound for a car.

480
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,514
(honking)

481
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:34,347
I like that.

482
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:38,160
It's not too wimpy, it's
like a good medium so.

483
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,610
- [Ben] The S is overly aggressive.

484
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,360
You tap it and oh man, you feel bad.

485
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,710
- Yeah, you're like oh jeez sorry.

486
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,060
- You honked the horn everywhere,

487
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,670
you're like a little kid.

488
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,450
- [Jared] I wanted to hear
what that sounded like.

489
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,400
- I love it, I love it.

490
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,233
When you took off,
(honk)

491
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:51,960
I could feel the smile on your face

492
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,852
when you were driving away from me.

493
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,685
(laughs)

494
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:55,518
Alright, go enjoy.

495
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:56,504
- The one thing that takes
a little getting use to,

496
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,910
is there's nothing right here.

497
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,530
Everything you have is right here,

498
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:02,340
but I love how minimal that is.

499
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,669
Oh man that get up, that was a good one.

500
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,070
(laughing)

501
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,540
That get up and go is just so good.

502
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,860
Thanks for letting me drive it man.

503
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,200
This is so cool.
- Of course.

504
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,710
- Ellie Ellie, are you listening?

505
00:16:17,465 --> 00:16:18,316
My birthday.

506
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:19,450
(laughing)

507
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,900
Probably one of the strangest things to me

508
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,050
is how you get out.

509
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,400
You push this button
and that opens the door

510
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,991
and then you just push it open.

511
00:16:26,991 --> 00:16:29,300
That's kinda interesting to me.

512
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,456
Now that I've driven it,

513
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,270
I've gotta get a picture with it.

514
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,100
Is that kinda weird?

515
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,340
This is the person I want
to get a picture with

516
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,760
more than anyone at CES.

517
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,593
This Model 3.

518
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,710
- Oh you mean the car.

519
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,340
- Oh sorry Ben, yeah yeah,

520
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,210
you can be in the picture if you want.

521
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,250
Get out of town, look at this.

522
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,850
You can draw on the screen.

523
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,560
Look at that.

524
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Ellie, it's our Model 3 now.

525
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,550
Publish, boom.

526
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,863
(laughs)

527
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:03,590
Yes, what, so should I do it or not?

528
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,910
- Do it.
- Should I send it to Elan?

529
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,742
- Of course.

530
00:17:05,742 --> 00:17:07,159
- [Jared] Elan, it's coming your way dude.

531
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,664
- [Man] I don't think he's doing enough.

532
00:17:08,664 --> 00:17:09,540
(laughing)

533
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,440
- [Jared] Wait, so you're telling me,

534
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,050
you're not driving this car right now.

535
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:13,883
- Hands free.

536
00:17:13,883 --> 00:17:14,715
- [Jared] What the heck?

537
00:17:14,715 --> 00:17:15,549
Are your feet on the pedals?

538
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,378
- No feet.
- What?

539
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:19,339
(laughing)

540
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,869
- [Jared] This car is
driving itself right now.

541
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:22,639
That's insane.

542
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,250
Like look, you can see blind spot stuff,

543
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,099
you can see the car in front of you.

544
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:29,950
This is so crazy to me.

545
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,352
- [Ben] Yeah and you can adjust the speed

546
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,185
If you want to go faster,

547
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,170
well we have a guy in front of us.

548
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,600
You can change lanes and stuff too.

549
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,680
I'll wait for cars, so
it's a little bit safer.

550
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,120
So if I want to change lanes,

551
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,920
I just, without touching the wheel,

552
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,220
I just tap this to the right.

553
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,460
Oh, it's gonna do it and then get us back.

554
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,420
- [Jared] We gotta get
back over, that's funny.

555
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,270
- Well it did it,

556
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,749
it worked.
- Yeah it did it, yeah.

557
00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:54,460
- Oh my gosh, it just blows my mind

558
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,720
that these things can happen now.

559
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,730
That's so crazy to me.

560
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,030
This is so cool.

561
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,580
Sorry guys, I'm geeking out,

562
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,890
I'm geeking out here.

563
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:04,560
- [Ellie] Are you feeling better Mr. Cal?

564
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,400
He's been acting really good today,

565
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,620
hasn't had a fever.

566
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,000
He just took that big long nap.

567
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,270
We'll see how you do tomorrow,

568
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,890
but he's done pretty well.

569
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,890
How are you mister?

570
00:18:14,805 --> 00:18:15,638
- Good.

571
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:16,830
- [Ellie] You're good, we're eating a bowl

572
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,650
of fruit before bed.

573
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,410
We just had soup.

574
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,510
Can't wait for Daddy to get home tomorrow.

575
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,005
Did that put a smile on your face?

576
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:27,930
(Ellie laughs)

577
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:29,440
You can't wait to see Daddy

578
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,510
or you can't wait to see his little,

579
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,120
his game that you play with?

580
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,613
- What game?

581
00:18:36,613 --> 00:18:38,210
- His Mario game.

582
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,900
Jared has this Mario game

583
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
that Jackson has figured out how to play

584
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,130
and he's been looking for it,

585
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,963
for a few days.

586
00:18:44,963 --> 00:18:46,940
And I'm like nope, it's with Daddy.

587
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,350
Our lighting, like
everyone looks extra pale.

588
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,100
I know the settings are off on the camera.

589
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,600
(Calvin vocalizing)

590
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,950
I wish I knew how to fix it.

591
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,580
I'm gonna have Jared teach me.

592
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,850
When he gets back.

593
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,020
Okay Jared, I'm gonna have you teach me

594
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,853
how to do the settings,

595
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:03,680
because it's bad, it's out of focus

596
00:19:04,788 --> 00:00:00,000
and it's bad.
