1
00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:03,746
- [Ellie] What dance moves
did Bonnie just teach Jackson?

2
00:00:03,746 --> 00:00:05,140
(laughs)

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,570
- Good job, Jackson! What a great helper!

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,130
We have created fire!

5
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,660
Good morning and happy Saturday.

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,410
Today is the day before The Big Game

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:16,239
cause I guess you're not
allowed to say Super Bowl.

8
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,073
I mean, oops
- [Ellie] Why?

9
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:18,900
- I said it. For these legal reasons.

10
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,210
Like NBC, I think, or I can't
remember which network it is,

11
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,489
has the legal rights to
the word Super Bowl, and--

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,130
- And so people say The Big Game.

13
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:30,730
- That's exactly right like
on commercials and everything.

14
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,563
- I'm learning.

15
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:32,840
- You gettin' ready for The Big Game?

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,230
Yeah, it's all legal stuff.
- [Ellie] That's crazy.

17
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:38,133
- But we are going to get ready for the,

18
00:00:38,133 --> 00:00:41,380
enter legal appropriate name, Big Game.

19
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,310
- I'm on grocery list duty.

20
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,570
- [Jared] Guess what duty I am on?

21
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,570
- What duty do you have?

22
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,248
- I'm on poop patrol! Doody duty!

23
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,694
(laughs)

24
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:51,820
(laughs)

25
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,483
- You and the kids do poop duty.

26
00:00:54,483 --> 00:00:58,580
And, oh wood. Where am
I going to buy that?

27
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,623
- Um, I think they would
actually have some there too.

28
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:03,110
- And maybe in the mountains,
I could go chop down a tree.

29
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,950
- Yeah. I have an ax in the four wheeler

30
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,390
and the trailer, so.

31
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,460
- We used to do that
growing up at our house.

32
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,930
We just, we had trees that my
dad would make wood out of.

33
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,800
But we need some wood for the fire pit.

34
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,080
- Yeah, because we're having
a pre-party football game,

35
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,940
Big Game party.

36
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,820
Tonight, we've got some
family coming over,

37
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,340
and we're gonna have
a little get together,

38
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,450
and we're gonna do some fun stuff.

39
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:25,360
So, we've gotta get the yard picked up.

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,200
We've gotta get the house,

41
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,630
the house is pretty much picked up.

42
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,710
Thanks, mom. Like killin' it yesterday.

43
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,730
And Ellie is going grocery shopping

44
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,110
getting some Super Bowl snacks.

45
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,440
So, what are your favorite
Super Bowl snacks?

46
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,480
I know that we have a
video on Ellie's channel

47
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,313
about Super Bowl--

48
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:41,146
- [Ellie] That was forever ago.

49
00:01:41,146 --> 00:01:42,200
- Yeah, when we lived in our old place.

50
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,840
About our favorite Super Bowl snacks.

51
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,440
So, I'll have that linked down below.

52
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,680
So, you guys can check that out.

53
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,850
I know it's after the Super Bowl,

54
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,880
but it's still good snacks.

55
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,730
- Um, bean dip. We're making bean dip.

56
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,469
Smokies, chips, drinks, candy,
veggie tray, fruit tray.

57
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:55,800
All of it.

58
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,920
- Gosh, it is a beautiful day today.

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,590
I'm wearing my hoodie and vest,

60
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,690
and I don't even think I
need it, it's that beautiful.

61
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,100
But here's the thing, all
of the snow is melting.

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,407
So, it's the perfect opportunity
to get all those poops

63
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,509
that Penny has left us,
those little surprises,

64
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,760
and pick those up so
the yard is all clean.

65
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
But, here's how Utah works.

66
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,660
Utah is this glorious place

67
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,290
where the mountains are beautiful.

68
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,370
The weather is always changing.

69
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,870
And because the snow is
all melting right now,

70
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,157
and it's still barely the
beginning of February,

71
00:02:25,157 --> 00:02:27,840
I guarantee you that we'll have

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,140
at least one more big snowfall.

73
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,440
So, we're not done with
winter yet, not even close.

74
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,164
I can't remember what Groundhog
Day was supposed to say,

75
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:37,100
if it was Spring is coming

76
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,960
or we have to wait six more weeks.

77
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,442
But I guarantee we will have
at least one more big snowfall

78
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:45,450
that covers everything
where we'll have to plow

79
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,580
and do all of that stuff.

80
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,790
Because that's how Utah works.

81
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,820
If you're not satisfied
with the weather in Utah,

82
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,021
wait five minutes.

83
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:53,688
(playful music)

84
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,336
What'd you find?

85
00:02:58,336 --> 00:02:59,816
- A treasure map.

86
00:02:59,816 --> 00:03:00,960
- [Jared] A treasure map?

87
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,684
Do you think there's treasure somewhere?

88
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,790
- Uh, yeah.

89
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,940
- [Jared] Yeah, we'll have to look around.

90
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,191
Where did we find treasure before?

91
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:11,076
- When we were at our ninja--
- Yeah.

92
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:13,580
Well when I'm all done picking up poo,

93
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,256
maybe we can find some treasure.

94
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:16,560
- Hey, there's some.

95
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,140
- Yeah, there's some too.

96
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,600
The kids have been helping
me find all of the poop,

97
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,470
and I'm just like,

98
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,810
"Please don't step in
it, Gavo, Gavo, Gavo!"

99
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,820
Don't step in it. They're little helpers.

100
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,650
- Poo poo.
- Yeah, good job.

101
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,620
Alright. Here is what I want you to do.

102
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:32,400
We've got the leaf blower.
Pretty sweet, right?!

103
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,770
We are going to blow some
of this dirt and stuff

104
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,260
back where it belongs in between the rocks

105
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,300
with all the bark and all of that. Okay.

106
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,610
Now, pull the trigger.

107
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,120
(motor revs)

108
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,610
Yeah! You're doing great bud!

109
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,170
Good job! Woo!

110
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,240
Yeah! Good job, buddy!

111
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,873
Good job, Jackson! What a great helper!

112
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,691
Yes! He's old enough to help.

113
00:03:59,691 --> 00:04:01,128
(laughs)

114
00:04:01,128 --> 00:04:03,711
(upbeat music)

115
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,932
(laughs)

116
00:04:12,932 --> 00:04:15,130
- I just grabbed the camera and mic.

117
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,130
Hey, you two are making soup
for tomorrow and tonight.

118
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,730
The boys are out playing,

119
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,870
and Jackson is doing his favorite thing.

120
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,410
This is their favorite thing
to to do at Aunt Bonnie's.

121
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,320
Whoop!
(laughs)

122
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:39,610
So nerve racking.

123
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,650
- [Bonnie] I'm scared
they're gonna hit their bums

124
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,500
on the floor.

125
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,937
(screams)
(laughs)

126
00:04:46,937 --> 00:04:49,590
You just rolled across the floor!

127
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,438
(upbeat music)

128
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,480
What dance moves did
Bonnie just teach Jackson?

129
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:18,534
(laughs)

130
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:20,736
We don't invite people
to our dance parties

131
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:23,922
because usually they don't
end up how they should.

132
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:25,514
I'm not filming that.

133
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:28,470
(upbeat music)

134
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,303
- And we're back.

135
00:05:29,303 --> 00:05:31,470
So, we went shooting
while the girls hung out,

136
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:35,570
cooked, did fun stuff with
the kids, and we're back home.

137
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,050
But the night is not over yet.

138
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,280
In fact, it is just beginning.

139
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,160
We've got Ellie's parents coming over,

140
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,900
Landon and Julie coming over,
Bonnie and Joel coming over,

141
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,970
and we're all going to
hang out and have some food

142
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,940
and get in the hot tub,

143
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,490
and I think we may even
have a little campfire.

144
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,750
But it's cold outside,
especially at the night time.

145
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,660
And we've had these guys, whoop,

146
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,740
these guys here for a while.

147
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,930
They are patio heaters, and
they have yet to be assembled.

148
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,480
So while Ellie is getting
the kids ready for bed,

149
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,962
I'm going to assemble a
patio heater, maybe two,

150
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:07,490
maybe three, I don't know. We'll see.

151
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,260
In between, I know this is crazy,

152
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,370
but in between the hot
tub and the campfire,

153
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:14,980
we're going to see if we
can have patio heaters.

154
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,330
As if that's not enough warmth,

155
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:19,410
we want to put patio heaters
there so we can sit out

156
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,941
and talk and enjoy each other's company,

157
00:06:20,941 --> 00:06:23,720
outside the hot tub, outside
of the fire. I don't know.

158
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,610
It sounds weird when I'm
talking about it, guys.

159
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,442
Just bare with me, we're going
to put this together, okay.

160
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:31,025
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,090
Alright. We've got her all assembled.

162
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,050
So, we've got a hot spot here,

163
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,530
a hot spot there,

164
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,430
a hot spot here.

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,850
So, I don't know like a hot spot here.

166
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,159
That's a mobile hot spot.

167
00:07:05,159 --> 00:07:06,080
(laughs)

168
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,060
There we go. Yeah buddy! There we go!

169
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,397
We have created fire!

170
00:07:13,397 --> 00:07:15,443
- We have made fire!

171
00:07:15,443 --> 00:07:16,276
Hey!

172
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,080
- It might smell funny for a second.

173
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,940
- And that white smoke,

174
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,031
well known fact, toxic to humans.

175
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,760
(laughs)

176
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,620
- Look how it just like
lights up the metal.

177
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,600
You know. It's so hot,
it's just like, ooh.

178
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,433
That's so cool.

179
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,000
- [Ellie] It's always a fun
day when mom gets her hair cut.

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,285
Bonnie's turn this time.

181
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:38,040
(laughs)
We switch up.

182
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,790
The boys have been outside
like laughing and yelling.

183
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,850
I don't even know what
they're laughing about.

184
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,780
Oh, I thought that was Penny.

185
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,090
You can see them all huddled out there.

186
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,810
I was like, "You should
build a fire tonight."

187
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:52,418
But they built the fire warmer and stuff.

188
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:54,588
(upbeat music)

189
00:07:54,588 --> 00:07:56,910
- The two little pregnant ladies.

190
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,580
Not so little though, are you?

191
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,330
Three, two, one.

192
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,240
I think it's absolutely crazy
insane that you are pregnant,

193
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:13,452
you are pregnant, Emily's
pregnant, Emily is pregnant,

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,310
and Jennifer is pregnant.

195
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,175
So many people in our family
are pregnant right now,

196
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:18,008
and that's very exciting.

197
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:19,880
And we're the only one having a boy.

198
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,745
- [Bonnie] I think that's cool.

199
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,040
(laughs)

200
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,740
- [Ellie] Penny. Penny.

201
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,060
She has made her rounds to
every single person 100 times.

202
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,666
She just kind of stays away from Bonnie.

203
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,743
(laughs)

204
00:08:34,743 --> 00:08:37,750
- What? No.
(laughs)

205
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,270
- Well, we kicked everyone out
of our house because frankly,

206
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,700
we just don't like the guests.

207
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,630
The guests have just been too much,

208
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,740
and it wasn't as fun as
we thought it would be.

209
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,820
Oh! I mean, maybe not everyone.

210
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,540
But that is gonna be it
from us tonight, guys.

211
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,000
Tomorrow is The Big Game.

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,960
We're talking about how legally,
we can't say Super Bowl.

213
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,070
I mean, The Big Game. You
know because legal stuff.

214
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,300
Anyway, thanks for watching guys.

215
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,820
If you enjoyed the vlog,
give it a big thumbs up.

216
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,510
And we will see you tomorrow.

217
00:09:04,510 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
