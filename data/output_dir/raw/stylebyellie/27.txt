1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,630
- Alright, it's that time again.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,950
That was incredible.

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:05,790
- That was phenomenal.

4
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,029
- [Jared] Look at these pregnant ladies.

5
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,730
- She has a new best friend.

6
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,563
- Wee.

7
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:12,986
- [Ellie] You are so cute.

8
00:00:12,986 --> 00:00:15,125
What did Calvin not
want you to say to him?

9
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:17,820
- He doesn't want me
to say sunshine to him.

10
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,746
- [Ellie] He didn't like that?

11
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:20,768
- [Jackson] No.

12
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:21,655
- [Ellie] Good morning Sunshine.

13
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:22,488
You doing okay?

14
00:00:22,488 --> 00:00:23,791
Should we eat breakfast.

15
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,813
- Yeah.

16
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:25,834
- [Calvin] No.

17
00:00:25,834 --> 00:00:26,667
- [Ellie] No?

18
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:27,500
What about chocolate milk?

19
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,732
Are you gonna help me get what I need?

20
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:32,753
- Yeah.

21
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:33,776
- Okay, good.

22
00:00:33,776 --> 00:00:36,193
(rock music)

23
00:00:41,694 --> 00:00:42,820
- Wee!

24
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,140
- [Ellie] You are so cute.

25
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:45,870
- You too.

26
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,380
- [Ellie] It is a cold, bitter day.

27
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,400
So nothing like fresh flowers
to brighten our spirits.

28
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,970
I've been on a little kick that every time

29
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,990
I go to the grocery store
I pick up a little bit

30
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,020
of fresh flowers just
because it's so cold outside.

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,290
It really does just like brighten our day.

32
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,516
It's just simple and small, but I love it.

33
00:01:05,516 --> 00:01:07,934
(rock music)

34
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:10,556
- Bye Mom.

35
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:11,485
- Bye Mom.

36
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:13,568
- Don't get into my food.

37
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:16,361
- [Ellie] Okay.

38
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:17,630
- Get in my food.

39
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,008
- [Ellie] Okay.

40
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:21,410
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,650
Did you think you wanted help clean

42
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:26,980
and you're mad that she's not
letting you get more wipes?

43
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,520
Why don't you go play
and then we'll clean up

44
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,590
when we're done okay?

45
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,760
It is that time of day
where it's one o'clock

46
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,660
and the kids have requested a show.

47
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,170
Where I lay in bed and one lays next to me

48
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,170
and the other lays next to me.

49
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,010
Jackson is adamant that
he puts on the show.

50
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,360
We have a little cuddle, snuggle time.

51
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,280
At the play area, Jackson
gathered all of the kids

52
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,330
he was playing with and he goes,

53
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,780
do you guys wanna see my mom?

54
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,850
I laughed out loud.

55
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,770
I don't know why that made me laugh.

56
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,170
I thought it was cute that he was thinking

57
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,470
like I wanna show all my friends my mom.

58
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,300
They're just really cute.

59
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,033
Jackson always finds and makes friends.

60
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:07,150
Calvin is always so, so good to tag along

61
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,720
and run after then and play.

62
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,277
It's cute.

63
00:02:10,277 --> 00:02:11,790
All of of the kids at the play area

64
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:14,210
where grabbing the sanitation wipes

65
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,990
and they were wiping down the toys.

66
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,180
None of the kids were playing,
everybody was doing clean up.

67
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,400
The kids loved it and was so entertained.

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,360
But Jackson, why were
you sad at the play area?

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,318
- I didn't want that
girl to take those wipes

70
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,570
and throw them in the hamburger.

71
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,650
- [Ellie] In the garbage?

72
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,483
- Yeah.

73
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,290
- Yeah, there was as little girl.

74
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,190
She was like six and she's
like no more wipes to everyone.

75
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,510
But I let the kids each have two wipes

76
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,150
and they both wiped down slides
along with the other kids.

77
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,650
There was tons of other
kids wiping stuff down.

78
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,266
It was kinda cute.

79
00:02:48,266 --> 00:02:49,270
Okay, cuddle time.

80
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,679
Or is this called snuggle
time, what is it called?

81
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:52,512
- Cuddle.

82
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:54,950
- Cuddle, you always
love to cuddle me huh?

83
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,694
Get your head in here, there we go.

84
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:00,110
- Well, today is the day.

85
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,340
It's a very windy day.

86
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,630
My dad and I have driven
down to Salt Lake City, Utah,

87
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,090
and we are at the Tesla store.

88
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,837
Dad, it's time we got you a Tesla.

89
00:03:09,837 --> 00:03:11,973
- Yeah.

90
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,506
- [Jared] So which one do you want Dad?

91
00:03:13,506 --> 00:03:15,870
Do you want the red one or the white one?

92
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,850
- Let's get both.

93
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,060
- [Jared] Oh, that's a great idea.

94
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,540
Why not both?

95
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,220
We're actually here to test drive a Tesla.

96
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,330
- Feels awesome.

97
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,139
- [Jared] You've never
been in a Tesla before.

98
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:26,430
- No, I've never been in a Tesla before.

99
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,830
- [Jared] It's cool huh?

100
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:29,388
What do you think of that screen?

101
00:03:29,388 --> 00:03:30,790
- I think it's amazing.

102
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,453
Wow.

103
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:33,470
- [Jared] Do you think
Mom would let you get one?

104
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,938
- No.

105
00:03:34,938 --> 00:03:36,052
(laughter)

106
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:38,635
(techno music)

107
00:03:40,812 --> 00:03:41,645
- [Jared] Open it up.

108
00:03:42,693 --> 00:03:45,530
(laughter)

109
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,569
They call it a frunck.

110
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:50,286
(laughter)

111
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:51,401
Isn't that cool?

112
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:52,678
- A lot of horses in there.

113
00:03:52,678 --> 00:03:53,511
(laughter)

114
00:03:53,511 --> 00:03:54,480
- This is where we do it.

115
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,300
Are you ready for this?

116
00:03:58,134 --> 00:03:59,434
And it's in ludacris mode.

117
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:01,733
Okay, do you have your seat belt on Dad?

118
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:02,566
- I do.

119
00:04:05,456 --> 00:04:06,328
- Holy crap.

120
00:04:06,328 --> 00:04:08,578
(laughter)

121
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,740
That was awesome.

122
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,690
That was amazing.

123
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,399
Whoa, did you feel that?

124
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,232
- I did.

125
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,730
- [Jared] Okay Dad, don't kill us.

126
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,700
- No guarantees.

127
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:30,591
Actually I don't feel anything.

128
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,180
- [Jared] Isn't that weird.
- So bizarre.

129
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,026
- [Jared] You're good.
- I need to adjust.

130
00:04:35,026 --> 00:04:37,276
(laughter)

131
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,620
- So my dad has never
driven a Tesla before.

132
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,080
I kind of feel like he's a kid
in a candy store right now.

133
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,070
Everything we do, he starts laughing.

134
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,710
He's about to go into auto pilot.

135
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,830
- You wanna just keep your
hands rested on the wheel,

136
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,480
but you just supervise it.

137
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:57,540
- [Jared] What do you think?

138
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,270
- Gets me way too close.

139
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:04,680
I feel like I'm riding the left lane.

140
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,278
But now I feel comfortable.

141
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:08,740
I think Mom would really like this.

142
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,274
- [Jared] You think so?

143
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:11,107
- I think so.

144
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,140
- [Jared] Yeah, I think she'd like it.

145
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,680
Do you think she'd like this
or her red Mercedes Coupe

146
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,774
that she's been wanting
since she was a kid.

147
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:20,550
- I think if we got a red Tesla,

148
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,490
I think she would forgive me.

149
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,690
- [Jared] Go for it Dad.

150
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:27,710
(laughter)

151
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,260
- I'm afraid what I would
do with a car like this.

152
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,440
- [Jared] I think you only went up to 45.

153
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,630
- I know but did you feel those Gs?

154
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,303
- [Jared] That was awesome.

155
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:37,290
So what'd you think Mr. Tesla?

156
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,930
- Oh wow!

157
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:42,380
- [Jared] We drove the model SP100D.

158
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,213
Looks great.

159
00:05:43,213 --> 00:05:44,360
- I'm definitely a convert.

160
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,260
- [Jared] Oh good, I've converted you.

161
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:48,860
Oh man.

162
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:52,696
Now we're back in this rink-a-dink car.

163
00:05:52,696 --> 00:05:55,490
I'm spoiled now that we
have that test drive.

164
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,830
That was incredible.

165
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,740
- That was phenomenal.

166
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,380
- Oh my goodness.

167
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,930
I have to put my key in the ignition.

168
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,240
I have to shift.

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,980
The engine has to turn on.

170
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,320
I converted Dad though.

171
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,270
- Absolutely.

172
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,871
- So sorry Mom, Dad wants a Tesla

173
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:15,704
and it's all my fault.

174
00:06:15,704 --> 00:06:17,170
- There's a Tesla in my future.

175
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,003
(laughter)

176
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:18,920
- Hey, I'm hungry.

177
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,670
Why don't we go to lunch, my treat?

178
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:22,720
- Awesome.

179
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,741
- I get to pick though.

180
00:06:23,741 --> 00:06:25,158
McDonald's it is.

181
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:36,373
- You're a good singer.

182
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,416
I like singing with you.

183
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,553
- I love singing with you.

184
00:06:40,553 --> 00:06:42,970
(epic music)

185
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,471
- [Ellie] Whoa!

186
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,850
Are you gonna stomp it out?

187
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,528
Wahoo!

188
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:58,480
We listen to this
soundtrack every single day

189
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,230
and no one is sick of it.

190
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,460
The Greatest Showman, if you
haven't seen it, go watch it.

191
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:17,078
Did you want that kiss song?

192
00:07:17,078 --> 00:07:18,959
- [Jared] Don't you want that kiss song?

193
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,292
- Don't like that kiss song.

194
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:25,913
- Kiss my lips.

195
00:07:30,568 --> 00:07:31,640
- You're a good dancer Calvin.

196
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,726
My turn.

197
00:07:33,726 --> 00:07:35,976
(laughter)

198
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,480
He gets jealous of you.

199
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:47,200
- Alright, it's that time again.

200
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,750
It's Fondue Friday, wait it's Thursday.

201
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,880
It's Fondue Thursday.

202
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,490
- _ need to ask for the recipe.

203
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,330
I was like, I'm not giving it to you

204
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:00,310
'cause you're gonna invite,
she has a new best friend.

205
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,260
I was like, you're gonna invite them over.

206
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,400
She's like, no I won't.

207
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,200
I was like, 'cause I'm just being jealous.

208
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,210
I was like, you guys can all
come over here for fondue.

209
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,830
- Yeah, but not her friends.

210
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,430
- She's like I really feel like you're not

211
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,130
gonna give me the fondue recipe.

212
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:16,180
I was like, yeah, I'm not.

213
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,013
- No, we're not.

214
00:08:17,013 --> 00:08:19,620
It's actually a really
great cheese fondue recipe.

215
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:24,620
_, I really don't know how
to pronounce it and Swiss.

216
00:08:25,135 --> 00:08:26,621
- It's better than the Melting Pot,

217
00:08:26,621 --> 00:08:29,106
it's better than the
expensive meal that we,

218
00:08:29,106 --> 00:08:30,476
and it's so expensive.

219
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,309
- We know that means it's good.

220
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:33,860
This is boiling, we don't want it to boil.

221
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,950
We just want a little
simmer, simmer down now.

222
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,190
So I'm gonna add the cheese.

223
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:38,900
What else have we got, we've got chocolate

224
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,860
and we've got some good dipping stuff.

225
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,688
- Pineapple and strawberries
and chocolate dipping sauce.

226
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:47,612
- [Jared] Okay cheese,
let's simmer down now.

227
00:08:47,612 --> 00:08:50,195
(upbeat music)

228
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,450
Now that the kids are downstairs,

229
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,910
now that we're done with the cheese,

230
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,020
it's time to bust out the chocolate.

231
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,666
I have to be really quiet when I say that.

232
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,199
- This is more fun when
the kids are asleep.

233
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,449
- [Jared] Everyone enjoy.

234
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,420
Look at these pregnant ladies.

235
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,080
- We've gotta get a picture.

236
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,740
- [Jared] Who's further
along, you are Jen right?

237
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,510
When's your due date?

238
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,462
- May 30th.

239
00:09:24,462 --> 00:09:25,902
- [Jared] May 30th.

240
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,810
So that's what it is.

241
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,750
So Matt's wife, Emily, is end of April,

242
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,880
Jen is end of May, Ellie's end of June.

243
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,400
That's gonna be a crazy summer.

244
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,080
Well Penny, it's that time of night

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,980
where we say goodbye to our friends

246
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,070
after a wonderful day of spending time

247
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,980
with friends and family,
eating delicious food,

248
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,450
experiencing life to its fullest.

249
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,023
That's what you've been
doing, I know that.

250
00:09:53,023 --> 00:09:54,840
Yes, oh is that the spot today?

251
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,520
Found it, yep, got it.

252
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,920
You're such a good girl.

253
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,220
I wanted to thank you
guys for taking the time

254
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,830
and watching this video today.

255
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,090
Although Ellie and I spent most of the day

256
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:07,190
apart from each other,
we wrapped up the day

257
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,270
with each other with our
family and that was fun

258
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,901
to have dinner with my family,

259
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:14,710
having a new meal, it was great.

260
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,250
Thanks again for being with us today

261
00:10:17,250 --> 00:00:00,000
and we'll see you guys next time, bye.
