1
00:00:00,897 --> 00:00:02,147
- No not again!

2
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:09,044
Oh my gosh Jackson's going!

3
00:00:09,044 --> 00:00:12,405
You guys I think it's
time for a drastic change.

4
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:14,905
(happy music)

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,016
I tell you what!

6
00:00:21,016 --> 00:00:22,167
I tell you one thing,

7
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:25,212
there's nothing quite like
sleeping in your own bed

8
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,416
and having a shower in your own house.

9
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,430
- [Ellie] And using conditioner!

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,727
The last two times I washed my hair

11
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:32,894
I didn't have conditioner.

12
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:36,101
- The world is going to end!

13
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,604
You have energy power?

14
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:42,996
That's been the cutest thing.

15
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:44,967
Jackson's been playing
with these glow sticks

16
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,354
and then he calls them his energy.

17
00:00:47,354 --> 00:00:50,572
And it makes me think
of like Dragonball Z.

18
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:55,189
I don't have enough energy
to continue the fight!

19
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,509
Calvin does though.

20
00:00:57,509 --> 00:01:00,324
- I'm gonna save your head.

21
00:01:00,324 --> 00:01:01,574
- No not again!

22
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:05,132
Not my freshly done hair!

23
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:07,493
- [Ellie] Oh yeah seriously
you just did your hair.

24
00:01:07,493 --> 00:01:08,964
Come on let's get ready
we gotta go to church!

25
00:01:08,964 --> 00:01:09,797
- Guess what guys?

26
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,858
We have to go to church today.

27
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:13,302
Let's go wash your bums 'cause

28
00:01:13,302 --> 00:01:14,644
your bums are stinky!

29
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:15,654
- What's the bum song?

30
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:17,482
- [Jared] Yeah sing the bum song Jackson.

31
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:19,649
(mumbles)

32
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,917
- It's time to wash your bumy!

33
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,500
- When you are ready for church early

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,866
you get to sit on your bed
and you get to eat a snack

35
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:33,539
and watch a movie and that
is just what we're doing.

36
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:35,719
I made some eggs and I'm
eating it with salsa.

37
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,343
I usually just eat it alone.

38
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:39,558
Jared always eats his eggs with salsa

39
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,952
and it's good but I just never have and

40
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:44,736
I really like it and I'm enjoying it.

41
00:01:44,736 --> 00:01:45,702
Kids are watching a show.

42
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:47,933
We are watching Halloween Curious George

43
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,203
and speaking of Halloween and fall,

44
00:01:50,203 --> 00:01:53,005
I have loved summer and I'm
going to miss the warm days

45
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:56,779
'cause I really am not into
the whole cold weather but

46
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:59,070
Utah gets really cold really snowy,

47
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:01,012
but I am looking forward to fall.

48
00:02:01,012 --> 00:02:01,881
The fall weather,

49
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:03,714
the clothes Halloween.

50
00:02:05,284 --> 00:02:08,204
Last year we had moved
into the house in October

51
00:02:08,204 --> 00:02:11,694
and I had bought just a
few holiday decor items

52
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,732
just for like the mantle downstairs

53
00:02:13,732 --> 00:02:15,448
but I've been looking
online and I'm excited.

54
00:02:15,448 --> 00:02:19,799
I need to find a cauldron
because we're gonna make some fun

55
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:21,699
juice or some sort,

56
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:25,375
you know with boogers and eyeballs and

57
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:26,563
spiders to put in it.

58
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,833
I have a few small fun ideas for Halloween

59
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:31,081
that will be fun for the kids.

60
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:33,004
So that's what I've been
doing this morning but

61
00:02:33,004 --> 00:02:34,238
on to our eggs,

62
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,686
on to picking our nose,

63
00:02:35,686 --> 00:02:37,486
on to Curious George.

64
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:41,905
- So I spent the morning
doing something very special.

65
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:45,024
I was reunited with my friend Penny!

66
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:45,973
Come here Penny!

67
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:46,827
How are you girl?

68
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:48,136
I missed you so much!

69
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,620
I missed you so much!

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,625
Such a good girl!

71
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:52,492
Hey don't bite the camera!

72
00:02:52,492 --> 00:02:54,486
You know from experience
that that is not a good idea

73
00:02:54,486 --> 00:02:56,434
to get your camera close to Penny.

74
00:02:56,434 --> 00:02:58,376
I've missed this girl so much.

75
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:00,973
She was with some friends
of ours while we were gone

76
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:03,108
and now I'm reunited.

77
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,939
Still scared to get my face close to her

78
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:06,701
'cause she's that excited.

79
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:08,419
And I also wanted to
show one other thing that

80
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,978
happened while we were gone.

81
00:03:09,978 --> 00:03:11,981
As you guys know we
have this giant hot tub

82
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:13,281
which is like one of our favorite things

83
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,905
in the whole entire world,

84
00:03:14,905 --> 00:03:16,171
and while we were gone we had something

85
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:18,266
installed for protection,

86
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,698
for security and for looks.

87
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:22,196
All the controls are
down here in the hot tub

88
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:23,262
and we have young kids

89
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:25,164
and we don't want the
kids to fall down in here,

90
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,539
even though they never
really come around here,

91
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,861
we just want to prevent that.

92
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:29,287
So we have this

93
00:03:29,287 --> 00:03:31,874
to make it look all nice and cool.

94
00:03:31,874 --> 00:03:33,429
Kids can come over here

95
00:03:33,429 --> 00:03:34,278
and we can lift that up

96
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:35,933
if we ever need access in there.

97
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:38,069
I think it looks great don't you Penny?

98
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:40,402
(fun music)

99
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:02,143
I told you!

100
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:04,593
- [Ellie] And lunch is prepared!

101
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:06,659
- It smells so good!

102
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,235
I'm so glad you made dinner.

103
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,125
- She's like have you made this before?

104
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,937
And I was like yes.

105
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:15,607
This was a HelloFresh that
I made like a few weeks ago

106
00:04:15,607 --> 00:04:17,446
but you can just go to the store and

107
00:04:17,446 --> 00:04:19,064
buy all the stuff you know?

108
00:04:19,064 --> 00:04:19,897
Went to the store.

109
00:04:19,897 --> 00:04:22,023
It's spaghetti Ragu

110
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:24,000
and it has zucchini,

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,905
ground beef tomatoes,

112
00:04:25,905 --> 00:04:29,132
onion and obviously the spaghetti;

113
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:30,437
and it's really good.

114
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,509
- [Bonnie] Is that hamburger or pork?

115
00:04:32,509 --> 00:04:33,349
And you said Ragu.

116
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:35,232
Is there pizza sauce or is it just-

117
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:36,855
- [Ellie] It's just tomato stuff.

118
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:39,535
Like this is exactly what
the recipe calls for.

119
00:04:39,535 --> 00:04:41,205
Just Beef Ragu,

120
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:44,038
that's all the stuff that's in it.

121
00:04:45,408 --> 00:04:46,241
Should we eat?

122
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,853
- I think that's a great-
- [Ellie] How was church?

123
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:48,910
Were you kind to people?

124
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,698
- I was kind to people.

125
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:52,018
- [Ellie] Did you heart people?

126
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:55,507
- I hearted people and I'm
hoping you heart people to.

127
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,470
- I came home early with Calvin.

128
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,072
- Without fail anytime we
have kids over at the house

129
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:03,059
this comes out!

130
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:04,757
It's peanut butter jelly time!

131
00:05:04,757 --> 00:05:06,308
Peanut butter jelly time!

132
00:05:06,308 --> 00:05:08,342
Peanut butter jelly time!

133
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,954
Tell me what made you think to
put that on right now Olivia?

134
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:12,494
- I just want to be like a banana.

135
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:15,571
- [Jared] You just wanted
to be like a banana.

136
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:18,011
There are days where I want
to feel like a banana to

137
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,592
and that's exactly why we have it.

138
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:21,673
Alright kiddos I thought of a fun idea

139
00:05:21,673 --> 00:05:25,983
and I need every single one of your helps.

140
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:26,947
I need your help.

141
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:27,780
All of you.

142
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,780
Your help thanks Olivia.

143
00:05:31,393 --> 00:05:34,880
We have this giant big blue
slide right here right Cody?

144
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,613
And you love going down it don't you?

145
00:05:36,613 --> 00:05:37,743
I love going down it.

146
00:05:37,743 --> 00:05:38,703
Do you love going down it?

147
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,125
- I love going down it.

148
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,392
- I enjoy going down that slide.

149
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,329
- We go down the slide all the time.

150
00:05:44,329 --> 00:05:47,863
The competition is we are
going to run up the slide

151
00:05:47,863 --> 00:05:51,530
and we're gonna see who
can get the highest.

152
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:55,131
- [Olivia] Who can make
it to the very top?

153
00:05:55,131 --> 00:05:58,375
- [Jared] Oh my gosh Jackson's going!

154
00:05:58,375 --> 00:05:59,292
Oh my gosh!

155
00:06:02,607 --> 00:06:04,269
Oh he did it without hands!

156
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:06,511
Olivia or mom go!

157
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:10,678
- [Ellie] I don't know how
to do it without hands.

158
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:13,749
- [Jared] Go Olivia go!

159
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:15,876
Oh my gosh.

160
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:16,959
My turn guys.

161
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,543
Alright here I go no hands.

162
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:24,067
Ellie I'm gonna run right through you.

163
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,367
No one's letting me have a turn.

164
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,013
Calvin it's my turn!

165
00:06:28,013 --> 00:06:32,180
I just wanna run up the slide
and I don't wanna hurt anyone.

166
00:06:33,962 --> 00:06:35,862
This is so stinking cute.

167
00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,153
Here we go watch out Jackson!

168
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:38,820
- Trip over Jackson!

169
00:06:40,082 --> 00:06:41,158
- There we go!

170
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:43,325
(screams)

171
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:45,294
I made it!

172
00:06:47,414 --> 00:06:49,225
- Choo choo train!

173
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:51,803
- [Jared] Choo choo train?

174
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:52,779
Hold on guys.

175
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,273
I'm gonna send the camera down the slide

176
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:56,196
so Ellie can film the
choo choo train okay?

177
00:06:56,196 --> 00:06:58,521
- [Olivia] You guys gonna have fun now!

178
00:06:58,521 --> 00:06:59,578
- Don't want Penny getting it.

179
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:00,661
- [Jared] Hold on guys!

180
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:01,952
- She'll grab it.

181
00:07:01,952 --> 00:07:03,824
She's ready for it oh my gosh.

182
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:04,741
Here we go!

183
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,703
- [Ellie] You girl I
saw your mouth open up.

184
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:12,686
Is everyone gonna go behind you?

185
00:07:12,686 --> 00:07:15,269
- [Jared] Okay I've got a hold.

186
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,663
(applause)

187
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,707
- [Ellie] Only one roll.

188
00:07:29,707 --> 00:07:31,135
Pretty good no tears.

189
00:07:31,135 --> 00:07:32,402
- [Jared] I'll catch you!

190
00:07:32,402 --> 00:07:34,235
- I wanna do it again.

191
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,353
- [Ellie] Look at his hands.

192
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:39,639
Look at his hands!

193
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:42,427
- He's trying to hold on.

194
00:07:42,427 --> 00:07:45,988
We just said bye to Bonnie and the kids

195
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:47,963
and I'm just like where is Calvin?

196
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:49,431
Where is he?

197
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,605
And I'm calling his name and
I don't hear any response

198
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:53,559
and I hear some noises down here

199
00:07:53,559 --> 00:07:56,139
and he's got this apron around him

200
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,373
and he was in the hello room

201
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:00,658
and he was scrubbing the dishes.

202
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,188
That's what he was doing.

203
00:08:02,188 --> 00:08:04,322
Show us what you were doing Calvin!

204
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:07,184
He had this spoon and something

205
00:08:07,184 --> 00:08:09,326
and he was rubbing them together.

206
00:08:09,326 --> 00:08:10,159
- [Ellie] What were you doing?

207
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:13,326
- [Jared] Show us what you were doing.

208
00:08:15,466 --> 00:08:17,844
He put the apron on and did that.

209
00:08:17,844 --> 00:08:19,844
- That's a good cleaner!

210
00:08:21,403 --> 00:08:23,486
- [Jared] You are cheesy!

211
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,000
(mumbles)

212
00:08:28,097 --> 00:08:30,930
Can I have a nibble of the cheese?

213
00:08:32,232 --> 00:08:34,946
(laughter)

214
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:36,986
- My cheese costume you ate it!

215
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,357
- [Jared] It was so delicious!

216
00:08:38,357 --> 00:08:39,940
Oh is that ketchup?

217
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:51,320
(mumbles)

218
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:55,965
- I wanna show you something.

219
00:08:55,965 --> 00:08:57,526
I spilled juice on my shirt.

220
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:59,842
- [Jared] Oh you did oh no!

221
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:02,412
Don't worry I bet you we
can put it in the laundry

222
00:09:02,412 --> 00:09:03,331
and make it all clean.

223
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,996
Should we do that?

224
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,428
Okay let's go do that.

225
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:07,719
Brush your teeth

226
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,437
'cause it is almost time for bed!

227
00:09:09,437 --> 00:09:10,420
We gotta brush our teeth

228
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,240
and we gotta change into our pajamas

229
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,478
and have a good night huh?

230
00:09:13,478 --> 00:09:15,710
- When the sheep says...

231
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,543
does he really mean...

232
00:09:18,764 --> 00:09:20,347
And the cats say...

233
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:25,283
You guys I think it's
time for a drastic change.

234
00:09:25,283 --> 00:09:28,250
Ellie and I have been doing
good on various things.

235
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,447
We've been trying to eat healthier,

236
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:30,350
we've been active,

237
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,183
we've been working out,

238
00:09:31,183 --> 00:09:33,001
we've been taking Penny
for a walk and everything,

239
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,098
but I'm still feeling

240
00:09:35,098 --> 00:09:36,577
this weight holding me back.

241
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,326
Not physical weight but like mental,

242
00:09:38,326 --> 00:09:40,789
physical and emotional
weight holding me back

243
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:43,273
and I think it's time for a drastic change

244
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,753
and I need to do this.

245
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:47,483
I need to do this for me Ellie you know?

246
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,316
You're more than welcome to

247
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,065
come along with me.
- And I will.

248
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:53,313
- We've been doing good but
we haven't been doing great

249
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:55,090
and I want to do great.

250
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,923
There's a good,

251
00:09:55,923 --> 00:09:57,035
there's a better and the best.

252
00:09:57,035 --> 00:09:59,812
We've been doing good
and I want to do my best.

253
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:00,921
That's a big part of this.

254
00:10:00,921 --> 00:10:03,791
I feel like I've been doing
good but I can do better.

255
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:04,865
And that's the thing about it,

256
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:06,122
I've just gotta do it.

257
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:07,689
It's all or nothing!

258
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,304
It's time for something

259
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:11,985
serious and I did this two years ago?

260
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:15,705
When I said like I'm not
drinking Dr. Pepper for a year

261
00:10:15,705 --> 00:10:16,538
and I did that.

262
00:10:16,538 --> 00:10:18,952
I didn't drink Dr. Pepper or soda pop

263
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,114
for an entire year and
I need to do something

264
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:22,640
like that right now.

265
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,966
And I think being in North
Carolina with my family

266
00:10:24,966 --> 00:10:26,570
was like a big catalyst to that.

267
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,188
Just being with my family

268
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:31,235
and being at the pool and it's like...

269
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:33,857
It's not that I'm like out
looking at myself when I'm...

270
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:36,350
It's nothing like that it's
just I want to feel better.

271
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,640
- Especially with your hips.

272
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,682
Jared and I have talked a lot it's like

273
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,406
you're not overweight at all

274
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,563
and I feel like we're pretty
active like as far as just like

275
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:47,848
daily like what we do and stuff but

276
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:49,015
one concern is

277
00:10:50,158 --> 00:10:53,697
if you do get bigger it's
really hard for you to work out

278
00:10:53,697 --> 00:10:55,577
'cause your hip hurts.

279
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:57,290
- And that's the other thing
'cause like with working out

280
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,735
a lot of these pains

281
00:10:58,735 --> 00:11:00,022
that you have will go away.

282
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:01,052
A lot of your back pains,

283
00:11:01,052 --> 00:11:03,166
your knee pains will go
away because your muscles

284
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:05,058
have been building up the
muscles that you haven't

285
00:11:05,058 --> 00:11:07,177
used to the extent that you used to.

286
00:11:07,177 --> 00:11:08,171
And that used to be me.

287
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:11,004
I used to be a collegiate athlete.

288
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:13,660
It's just like it's frustrating and I've

289
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,792
gotten to that point where I just like

290
00:11:14,792 --> 00:11:16,715
I need to make a change right now.

291
00:11:16,715 --> 00:11:19,264
So this is what I'm gonna do
and I need the accountability

292
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:21,130
and that's the other thing
is I need the accountability

293
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:22,662
so I'm telling you guys about it.

294
00:11:22,662 --> 00:11:25,466
For one month right now...

295
00:11:25,466 --> 00:11:27,262
Calvin is coming out
of bed and he's dressed

296
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:28,762
like he's a ghost.

297
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:33,276
For one month I'm going to work out

298
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:36,191
at least six days a week maybe seven.

299
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:39,097
And have like one cheat
day is what they call it

300
00:11:39,097 --> 00:11:41,139
and that's pretty normal with workouts

301
00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:42,225
and maybe I won't even do that,

302
00:11:42,225 --> 00:11:43,874
but for one month I'm going to do that

303
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:45,399
and then I'm gonna have a review.

304
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,266
And then I'm gonna try
and go for two months

305
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:48,113
but I need to do this

306
00:11:48,113 --> 00:11:49,779
and I need to tell you guys about it and

307
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:50,881
I just think it's time for a change

308
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,657
and I'm gonna start being
more committed and doing that

309
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:55,726
because I think physically
it's gonna help me out

310
00:11:55,726 --> 00:11:57,308
and a lot mentally to.

311
00:11:57,308 --> 00:11:59,193
I feel like I've kinda been in a slump

312
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:00,908
the past little while
and I think this is gonna

313
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,365
help a lot with that.

314
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:04,773
Getting up working out.

315
00:12:04,773 --> 00:12:05,834
Walking the dog,

316
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,303
I do that everyday anyway but I feel like

317
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:08,190
that's gonna be a good warm up.

318
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,126
- Like get your heart
racing you know working out.

319
00:12:11,126 --> 00:12:14,104
I had so much fun doing CrossFit

320
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:16,288
but it's hard leaving

321
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:17,153
the house to work out.

322
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,346
I think a lot of people
can relate to that.

323
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:22,324
It's hard to like do that you know?

324
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:24,886
- I've got a machine
downstairs and I need to use it

325
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,154
and so I'm going to.

326
00:12:26,154 --> 00:12:27,984
Guys I'm telling you

327
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:29,037
so it's on the blog.
- You can do it!

328
00:12:29,037 --> 00:12:30,301
- I'm gonna do it
- I'm proud of you.

329
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:31,516
We can do it.

330
00:12:31,516 --> 00:12:32,915
We will do it.

331
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,633
We'll take Calvin to bed!

332
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:35,813
- Well guys here it is.

333
00:12:35,813 --> 00:12:36,982
I started this a long time ago

334
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,334
and never got finished
but I finally finished

335
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:41,866
because I'm motivated.

336
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,898
Plus I have a little Marvel Defenders,

337
00:12:44,898 --> 00:12:47,835
you know like Daredevil and
Jessica Jones and all that,

338
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,899
I've been watching that and that's been

339
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:52,163
really fun to keep me company
while I've been building that.

340
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:55,471
It is late at night and I'm
gonna have an early morning

341
00:12:55,471 --> 00:12:56,846
'cause I'm gonna start everything.

342
00:12:56,846 --> 00:13:00,447
So Roman Atwood wants to
have a demolition derby.

343
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,680
I think that's like
the coolest thing ever.

344
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,124
I was talking to my buddy Shonduras

345
00:13:04,124 --> 00:13:06,777
who's actually confirmed
he's going to do that thing

346
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:08,615
which I think is so awesome!

347
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:09,931
I think it's fun that

348
00:13:09,931 --> 00:13:12,453
Roman is bringing a lot
people together and that's

349
00:13:12,453 --> 00:13:13,960
one of the coolest things about it.

350
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,276
I would love to do this,

351
00:13:15,276 --> 00:13:17,236
whether I do or not,

352
00:13:17,236 --> 00:13:19,115
this is gonna be so cool to have all the

353
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:22,156
creators come together
and all of the viewers

354
00:13:22,156 --> 00:13:23,451
come together to this stadium.

355
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:27,004
I think it's gonna be pretty
cool to see it all unfold.

356
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:29,141
I don't think anything like
this has been done before.

357
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,473
I mean there's been
tours and everything but

358
