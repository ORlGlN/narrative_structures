1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,430
- If you're from Louisiana,

2
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:02,420
my mom speaks the truth.

3
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:03,810
- This is so fun.

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:05,630
- I just got a message

5
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,390
from one of our IVF couples.

6
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,397
See, it's funny.

7
00:00:08,397 --> 00:00:09,640
(laughing)

8
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,473
Thank you.

9
00:00:10,473 --> 00:00:11,306
Good morning guys.

10
00:00:11,306 --> 00:00:13,120
I found you right where
I left you last night.

11
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,376
I'm up bright and early
at six in the morning,

12
00:00:15,376 --> 00:00:18,450
which I actually get to sleep in today,

13
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:21,100
because usually I wake
up at five in the morning

14
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,933
to go to the gym,

15
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:26,130
but I am going to be in Salt
Lake City today all day long

16
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,150
for meetings and I'm very excited.

17
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,810
It's someone that I've never met with

18
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,140
and I'm anxious to see some things

19
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,640
that they have to say.

20
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,720
A little company called
Facebook and Instagram.

21
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,250
Ooh, Facebook owns Instagram,
so it's kinda same same,

22
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,773
but a little bit different.

23
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:43,380
Anyway, but I have to hit the road

24
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,850
in order to get there on time,

25
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,940
because traffic and snow is
a little cray cray today.

26
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,680
- [Ellie] He wanted to poke your eye.

27
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,953
Okay run dinosaur run, run!

28
00:00:51,953 --> 00:00:53,641
Go get him.

29
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,965
(Jackson laughing)

30
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:56,843
- Ball.

31
00:00:56,843 --> 00:00:59,459
- Ooh wait, what about we hugging

32
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,100
and run together.

33
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,621
(Ellie laughs)

34
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,660
(laughing)

35
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,100
- [Ellie] Who's gonna fall down first?

36
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,830
Oh they both did.

37
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:10,082
Who won?

38
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:11,113
- I did.

39
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,627
(Ellie laughs)

40
00:01:12,627 --> 00:01:14,227
- Me.

41
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:15,260
- [Ellie] You won?

42
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,636
I think you both won.

43
00:01:16,636 --> 00:01:18,652
(laughing)

44
00:01:18,652 --> 00:01:20,029
(Ellie laughs)

45
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,612
(bright music)

46
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:27,444
You okay?

47
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:28,600
(Calvin vocalizing)

48
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,871
What did Mom do?

49
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:31,566
- Bumped my head.

50
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:33,156
- Well why were you
standing right by the fridge

51
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:35,583
when I opened the door?

52
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,833
- I don't know.

53
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,850
- I totally just bonked his head.

54
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,683
Sorry.

55
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,620
This is Jack, Calvin's favorite drink,

56
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,870
which is chocolate milk.

57
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,852
And Jackson, what's your favorite drink?

58
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:46,685
- [Jackson] Chocolate milk.

59
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:48,110
- Yours is chocolate milk?

60
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,600
And Mama's lately has
been strawberry water.

61
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,770
I love Gatorade.

62
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,810
I've been really trying
to just drink water

63
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,310
and I've always had a hard time

64
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,960
drinking just plain water,

65
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,450
but if I have strawberries in it,

66
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,850
I will drink two or three of these a day.

67
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,090
Which is my goal is to drink

68
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,280
at least four a day,

69
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,930
I think that would be perfect,

70
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,720
but if I get two in, I'm happy.

71
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,090
Every morning, I just cut
up fresh strawberries,

72
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,470
I fill it up throughout the day

73
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,980
and then the next morning I do it again.

74
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,240
I cut up a few strawberries

75
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,110
have ice and then that's my whole day.

76
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,670
I've been feeling really good

77
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,540
as far as keeping hydrated.

78
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,341
Calvin, will you grab that sock?

79
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:26,508
(upbeat guitar music)

80
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,334
- No no no!

81
00:02:37,334 --> 00:02:40,276
- Sorry Calvin, I didn't mean to do that.

82
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:43,443
(upbeat guitar music)

83
00:02:51,748 --> 00:02:53,020
- Choo choo train.

84
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,600
- [Ellie] When I see messes
left over from the kids,

85
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,070
I think it is the cutest
thing in the world.

86
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,850
Like what was Calvin thinking

87
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,140
as he was playing with
his horses over here?

88
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,070
I think that mess is so cute.

89
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,570
With Jared and I in the photo
organization life right now,

90
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,780
trying to get all of our photos organized

91
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,680
and into books,

92
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,690
that is one thing I want to do more of

93
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,950
is take a picture of what
the kids have left behind,

94
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,240
whether it's the rock in the dryer

95
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,790
that came from Jackson's pants

96
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,146
or the horses that are on the table

97
00:03:23,146 --> 00:03:24,670
from Calvin playing with.

98
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,170
Just once in a while, when I see something

99
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,950
that's really cute, take a picture of it

100
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,610
and just have it in a little file

101
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,430
in our computer and
eventually print a book

102
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,100
that's called the kids' nicknacks.

103
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,960
These cute moments that the kids

104
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,650
aren't even in, but just something

105
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,830
that they've left behind.

106
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,800
That's just so funny to me.

107
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,666
I don't know, maybe it's
just a parent thing,

108
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,730
you think it's cute if it's your own kid.

109
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,560
But that's just really sweet.

110
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,570
I'm going to be 22 weeks tomorrow

111
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,570
and baby will be the size of a coconut,

112
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,620
is what my app says,

113
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:57,610
and I can't believe I'm gonna be 22 weeks.

114
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,160
I am moving really slow.

115
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,820
I think I'm definitely moving slower

116
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,730
this pregnancy than I ever have

117
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,668
and I definitely think it's because

118
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:07,200
I have two other toddlers that I have

119
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,660
and just other stuff that's going on,

120
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,640
but just pregnancy, I'm moving slow.

121
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,400
I can't wait to go to my
chiropractor appointment tomorrow.

122
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,290
My eyes have been hurting for a few days.

123
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,870
And it's like clockwork,
if I don't go every Monday,

124
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,720
if I go any further, I'm miserable.

125
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,340
And I didn't go on Monday,

126
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,590
so I have an appointment tomorrow,

127
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,120
so my head's killing me.

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,870
I'm just feeling very pregnant,

129
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,010
but little baby is doing well.

130
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,530
I feel him kicking

131
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,500
and I feel good other
than just the typical

132
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,410
tiredness and headache stuff.

133
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:39,540
This is so fun.

134
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,190
I have a lady here, she's going out

135
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,220
to get some more prints,

136
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,500
but we are finally getting some shades

137
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,680
on these windows.

138
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,040
Especially this summer,
last summer I was like

139
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,500
how did we go all summer
without shades on there

140
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,300
with the sun blaring through.

141
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,550
But I'm pretty sure I'm
gonna go with clamshell.

142
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,880
But we're gonna do a fun pattern

143
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,940
in my bathroom.

144
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,001
So this is gonna be for the windows

145
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,185
and then I'm gonna do a fun pattern

146
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:03,180
for my bathroom.

147
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,672
(gentle music)

148
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:11,370
- [Jackson] Calvin is asleep.

149
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,630
- I have returned from
my meeting with Facebook.

150
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,770
Is our lens super dirty?

151
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,680
I think it's super dirty.

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,300
Don't worry, I'll clean it, just a second.

153
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,133
It was fun.

154
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:22,760
I had some one on one time with Facebook,

155
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,060
which was very really cool

156
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,269
to talk to them about
some things they have

157
00:05:26,269 --> 00:05:27,570
up and coming.

158
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,190
But that's not the
important thing right now.

159
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,730
I just got a message from one of our

160
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,910
IVF couples Aaron and Rylie.

161
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,820
They had their baby a few months ago

162
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,370
and they said, hey Jared,
we're in your town,

163
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,750
would you like to see the baby?

164
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,730
And we said, yes absolutely,

165
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,870
come over for dinner, because
we just picked up Costa Vida

166
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,360
and they are going to join us.

167
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,890
I am so excited, this is so cool Ellie.

168
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,179
This is so cool.

169
00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:54,012
- What?

170
00:05:54,012 --> 00:05:55,294
That we get Costa Vida for dinner or?

171
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,400
- [Jared] Oh yeah yeah, that's cool.

172
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,233
Yeah.

173
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,066
(Jared laughs)

174
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,040
- I'm hungry please.

175
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,740
- [Jared] Keep singing it brother.

176
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:05,270
- No.

177
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,153
- [Jared] Caught ya.

178
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:09,017
- I think the red, there's the baby.

179
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:10,045
- Is that the baby?

180
00:06:10,045 --> 00:06:10,878
- Mmm-hmm.

181
00:06:10,878 --> 00:06:11,809
- Do you like him?

182
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:12,900
- Mmm-hmm.

183
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,799
- Are you gonna be nice when we have baby?

184
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:15,632
- Yeah.

185
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:16,751
- Are you gonna want to hold him?

186
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,584
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:18,961
- Okay, sounds awesome.

188
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,120
(laughs)

189
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,500
- Guys, Aaron and Rylie are here, yay.

190
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,650
- Hey.
- Yay.

191
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,590
- [Jared] And they
brought their baby Declan.

192
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:27,120
- And Calvin is being really good.

193
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,720
- [Jared] Yes he is.

194
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,470
Hi bud, can you give us a smile?

195
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,600
Look at him look right into the camera.

196
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,521
- Well thanks for coming over,

197
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,950
because it is February

198
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,391
and we washed our hands.
- I know.

199
00:06:37,391 --> 00:06:38,224
- Yeah.
- Right.

200
00:06:38,224 --> 00:06:39,782
- It's kinda scary bringing a baby out.

201
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:42,153
- Well he already had RSV, so.

202
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,843
- Aww, how's he doing?
- That's awful.

203
00:06:43,843 --> 00:06:44,676
- He's doing good.

204
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,649
- Is that scary?
- Good.

205
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:46,482
- We actually have just gotten over it.

206
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:47,315
- I didn't know that.

207
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:48,247
- It was so scary.
- Like last week.

208
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:49,080
- [Ellie] I didn't know that.

209
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
- Yeah, we were worried about him having

210
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,530
to go to the hospital.

211
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,916
Or dying or, yeah.

212
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:56,020
- [Ellie] Babies, yeah they die with that.

213
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,890
- After the baby gets here

214
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,709
and then it's three months later.

215
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,026
- It's okay.
- We all get busy.

216
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:02,206
- It's okay.
- Sorry, sorry.

217
00:07:02,206 --> 00:07:03,660
- No, it's life.

218
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,980
I do not blame you and
it's winter, so it's okay.

219
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,693
- Oh look at the smile.

220
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:09,048
- He is so handsome.

221
00:07:09,048 --> 00:07:10,120
- [Aaron] Oh thanks.

222
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,370
- I can't believe this.

223
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,283
- [Aaron] He looks a lot
like her side of the family.

224
00:07:13,283 --> 00:07:14,116
- My side of the family.

225
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:14,949
- Really?

226
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:16,370
- [Jared] Well I was gonna
say, I see some blond,

227
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,701
but there's some red in there too.

228
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:19,733
- Yeah that's what people tell me.

229
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:20,596
- The fair skin,

230
00:07:20,596 --> 00:07:22,251
the really pretty fair skin.
- Yeah yeah.

231
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,060
- He's so cute.

232
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,120
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

233
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,830
- I just can't believe how stout he is.

234
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,663
- Yeah.

235
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,738
- But maybe it's because
Calvin was this little--

236
00:07:29,738 --> 00:07:32,490
- Calvin was tiny and Jackson was a chunk.

237
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,217
Like looking back at our photos,

238
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:35,910
that was like Jackson.

239
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,743
- Yeah.

240
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,370
- [Jared] He's got the
chubby cheeks and everything.

241
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,949
- It's kinda nice to hold a hearty baby.

242
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:41,362
- Yes yes.

243
00:07:41,362 --> 00:07:42,195
(Jared laughs)

244
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,821
- I think he weighs as much as Calvin.

245
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:44,732
(laughing)

246
00:07:44,732 --> 00:07:46,590
- You know it's been a really long day

247
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,259
when Dad is falling asleep at the table.

248
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:49,092
(Jared laughing)

249
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,151
- I'm not.

250
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,580
- Mom?

251
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,280
Yeah, he totally is.

252
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,290
Dad and I actually both droved out.

253
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,300
I went to Salt Lake,

254
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,130
Dad went even further
down into Utah county

255
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,510
is what we're calling it

256
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,170
and he had a meeting
with his brother today,

257
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,310
which was pretty cool.

258
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,700
And you know, driving in Utah,

259
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,760
with the worst drivers in
the world, it's tiring.

260
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,600
Wouldn't you say Dad?

261
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,060
- It is, absolutely.

262
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,527
- So Ellie, I'm sorry to
throw you under the bus.

263
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,618
- Oh it's okay.

264
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:16,451
(laughing)

265
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,990
Get it, because we're
talking about driving?

266
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,835
It's funny.

267
00:08:18,835 --> 00:08:20,000
(laughing)

268
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,950
Thank you, thank you I needed that.

269
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,540
It's tiring driving with
some of the worst drivers.

270
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,820
Honestly, I think in a national ranking,

271
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,720
like a poll,

272
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Utah was number four
worst states to drive in.

273
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,393
- Well they're mean.

274
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:33,657
The other day, someone flipped Jared off

275
00:08:33,657 --> 00:08:36,280
out of the middle of
nowhere, and we're like,

276
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,169
we're going 15 over, and
he still was ticked at you.

277
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,316
It was really bad.

278
00:08:41,317 --> 00:08:44,880
- Louisiana has worst drivers than Utah.

279
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,990
- Yep yep.

280
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,823
- I'll say that.

281
00:08:46,823 --> 00:08:47,656
Oh my goodness.

282
00:08:47,656 --> 00:08:49,320
- Look if you're from Louisiana,

283
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,478
my mom speaks the truth, okay?

284
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,160
(laughing)

285
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,753
I'm sorry if you're from Louisiana

286
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:54,586
and you're a good driver,

287
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:55,720
you're not included in that.

288
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,820
- [Ellie] Did she snort
a bone or something?

289
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,530
She sounds nasally.

290
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,910
What, you are sick of me?

291
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,010
Were you sick of me today?

292
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:04,180
- I missed my doggie today.

293
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,310
- [Ellie] She missed you.

294
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,143
- Yeah.

295
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:07,286
- Aww see, she does like me.

296
00:09:07,286 --> 00:09:09,330
Seeing Aaron and Rylie was so fun

297
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,870
and seeing their baby.

298
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,760
And seeing Jackson and Calvin

299
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,320
with the baby was so cute.

300
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,880
Calvin went and got his binky

301
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,940
and gave it to the baby

302
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,641
and was so sweet and soft.

303
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,631
It makes me excited to see what he's like

304
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,940
with our little guy coming.

305
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,480
And then when they left actually

306
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,440
at the dinner table, it
kinda shocked us all,

307
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,360
Jackson goes, is our baby gonna live?

308
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,250
And I said yes, our baby's gonna live.

309
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,550
It struck a chord, it was just like ahh.

310
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,970
Just hearing a toddler say that,

311
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,020
it's like he knows that I
did have the baby in my tummy

312
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,210
and the baby didn't live.

313
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:50,030
And it was just really weird.

314
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,160
Would you say weird?

315
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,090
Another word, sad, I don't know.

316
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,989
- It kinda takes you out of your body,

317
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:58,290
just making you think about everything.

318
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,780
Because we were open
about it with Jackson.

319
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,210
He knows what's going on and--

320
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,912
- But it was a good conversation to have.

321
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:06,750
It was sweet of him.

322
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,610
I don't know really what to say

323
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:11,060
other than that's what
happened, just yeah.

324
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,650
Broke this bad guy out last night,

325
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,790
it was the best sleep
I've had in a long time.

326
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,430
Pregnancy pillow, for the win.

327
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:19,900
Maybe that's why babies
like those bassinets

328
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,670
or what are they called?

329
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,990
Rock and plays or the
DockATots or something,

330
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,170
Docadots or something like that,

331
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,430
where it cocoons then,

332
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,890
because I had the best sleep ever

333
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,280
sleeping with my pregnancy pillow.

334
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,910
I should've busted it out weeks ago.

335
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,650
This little guy today is so sore

336
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,186
and so tired.

337
00:10:39,186 --> 00:10:44,115
Oh my gosh, my stomach
has not been this tight.

338
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:45,850
- Well when Aaron and Rylie were here,

339
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,090
you were like oh, I
pushed my tummy too hard.

340
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,340
- Yeah I was pushing my stomach

341
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:51,100
and it hurt so bad and I didn't mean to.

342
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,220
- That's okay, our little guys growing.

343
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,700
- It was crazy, but my stomach
feels super tight right now.

344
00:10:56,700 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see you guys tomorrow.
- Thanks for watching, bye.
