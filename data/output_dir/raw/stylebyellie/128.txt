1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,746
- Are you taking a little
power rest from preschool?

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:06,333
Were you busy today?

3
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,087
What did you do at preschool?

4
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:09,764
Did you enjoy painting?

5
00:00:09,764 --> 00:00:10,944
Yeah?

6
00:00:10,944 --> 00:00:13,104
Why are you so quiet?

7
00:00:13,104 --> 00:00:14,288
Hi.
- Hi.

8
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:16,359
- Why are you so quiet

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:18,892
Are you all camera shy?

10
00:00:18,892 --> 00:00:20,278
(laughs)
(paper rustling)

11
00:00:20,278 --> 00:00:23,338
Come here, I wanna see what you did.

12
00:00:23,338 --> 00:00:27,543
I looked at this when I got
it, and I thought you did

13
00:00:27,543 --> 00:00:28,376
so good.

14
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:32,238
Did you do all of this by yourself?

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,362
Did your teacher help you?

16
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:36,205
You did this by yourself.

17
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:38,238
Jackson brought this home
from school and I seriously

18
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,765
was like, "He is doing so good!"

19
00:00:40,765 --> 00:00:42,864
He traced his name.

20
00:00:42,864 --> 00:00:44,705
Oh, is that your truck?

21
00:00:44,705 --> 00:00:45,929
Wow.

22
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:49,679
And he traced all of that
and he did so good by staying

23
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:51,674
around the lines.

24
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:53,310
I'm proud of you.

25
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,389
You're so quiet.

26
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,437
You're so quiet.

27
00:00:57,437 --> 00:00:59,564
Do you just wanna rest?

28
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:00,748
Yeah?

29
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:02,298
And watch a little show?

30
00:01:02,298 --> 00:01:05,251
Well, I am gonna let him rest.

31
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:07,861
Seriously, I was so proud of him.

32
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,373
The house is a disaster.

33
00:01:09,373 --> 00:01:10,802
- Mommy, play that.

34
00:01:10,802 --> 00:01:11,823
- [Mom] Oh, do we need to charge that?

35
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:13,092
- Yeah.

36
00:01:13,092 --> 00:01:15,342
- Yeah, this is a disaster.

37
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,668
We have lots of picking up to do.

38
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,488
We have left over dinner from
the other night (giggles)

39
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:21,842
still just sitting there.

40
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,533
Kinda gross, need to pick up.

41
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,434
- [Jared] Okay, roll it out.

42
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:25,822
(mom mumbles)

43
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:28,271
You got the camera (laughing).

44
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:29,535
(boys giggling)

45
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:33,369
Good job boys, you're such good helpers.

46
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:35,062
Uh oh, uh oh.

47
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:38,000
- Almost.
- We almost had it perfectly.

48
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,672
- It almost needs to be pulled--

49
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:42,158
- [Jared] So we need to pull
it this say just a smidge,

50
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:44,894
and then rotate it that much right there.

51
00:01:44,894 --> 00:01:47,871
- Simon says touch your ear.

52
00:01:47,871 --> 00:01:51,296
- [Jared] Simon says touch your toes.

53
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:53,831
Simon says wiggle your nose.

54
00:01:53,831 --> 00:01:55,096
(giggles)

55
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:57,346
Simon says sit on your bum.

56
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:00,328
- [Ellie] Okay, now stay
there 'til the rug's done.

57
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:02,107
- [Jared] (laughs) Let's pull it hurry!

58
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,701
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

59
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:05,290
(rug flops)

60
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,998
- One, two, three.
(rug flops)

61
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:10,831
(Calvin talking indistinctly)

62
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:15,513
He wants you to touch your eye, Jacks.

63
00:02:15,513 --> 00:02:17,964
Tell 'em what else to do.

64
00:02:17,964 --> 00:02:19,047
Do your nose.

65
00:02:21,382 --> 00:02:22,255
- [Jared] Oops.

66
00:02:22,255 --> 00:02:24,213
- Oh, too much?
- Yeah, I just did a little

67
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:25,113
too much.

68
00:02:25,113 --> 00:02:28,428
I just don't know my own strength.

69
00:02:28,428 --> 00:02:31,454
- (laughs) Touch your bum.
- Touch your bum?

70
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:33,733
Your head.
- Awesome.

71
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,121
- I think that's it.
- We're getting there.

72
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:38,266
(boys cheering)

73
00:02:38,266 --> 00:02:40,433
- Guys, I'm tellin' ya, as
even as much as I did it

74
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:44,832
as a kid, our furniture is
not an obstacle course, okay?

75
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,789
Look, Calvin's even participating.

76
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:47,689
Woop!

77
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:49,240
Blast off!

78
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,073
Woo!

79
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,001
Penny, come!

80
00:02:53,247 --> 00:02:57,155
That's a good girl, that's a good girl.

81
00:02:57,155 --> 00:03:00,244
So mom went to a church activity.

82
00:03:00,244 --> 00:03:02,494
We have one hour til she gets home.

83
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:04,691
We have all this furniture
that we still have to move.

84
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,997
I don't want Ellie liftin' all this stuff

85
00:03:05,997 --> 00:03:08,003
if she doesn't have to.

86
00:03:08,003 --> 00:03:09,924
So I called my brother in law, Joel.

87
00:03:09,924 --> 00:03:11,275
Joel's on his way over
here and we're gonna see

88
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,810
if we can get all of the
furniture in the living room

89
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,203
set up just the way it was
before Ellie gets home.

90
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:19,035
Hopefully that will make her smile.

91
00:03:19,035 --> 00:03:20,178
I don't know, maybe snicker a little bit,

92
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:21,981
maybe do a little bit of the heel click.

93
00:03:21,981 --> 00:03:23,530
I don't know, maybe do
a little dance for me,

94
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,815
do a moon walk, recite
the Pledge of Allegiance?

95
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:27,418
I don't know, something of
the sort, I'm hoping to get

96
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:29,835
some sort of positive reaction from Ellie

97
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,026
once this is done.

98
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:32,546
Penny, come!

99
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,318
That's a good girl, yes!

100
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:36,151
Soft.

101
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:38,633
Oh, so, so, so, so soft.

102
00:03:38,633 --> 00:03:39,466
So, so, so, so soft.

103
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:41,051
Oh, that's a good girl!

104
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:44,718
(upbeat instrumental music)

105
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,571
By Job, I think I've done it.

106
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:55,738
I think I have everything.

107
00:03:57,023 --> 00:03:58,496
You probably will notice before I do

108
00:03:58,496 --> 00:03:59,680
if there's something missing.

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,153
But I've got the couch,
I've got the ottomans,

110
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,409
I've got the lamps, I got the accessories,

111
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,242
what do you call that?

112
00:04:04,242 --> 00:04:05,075
Decor?

113
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,802
Other lamp, genie lamp,

114
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:08,635
all of that stuff.

115
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:10,526
The bar stools, the table, the chairs.

116
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:12,403
I wiped everything down,
I vacuumed everything.

117
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:13,343
(Calvin talking indistinctly)
Yeah bud?

118
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:15,766
- (mumbles) in my bed.

119
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,449
- [Jared] You wanna sleep
in your bed tonight?

120
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:19,253
- Mm hmm.
- Aw, okay.

121
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:21,589
Now it's just a matter
of Ellie to get home.

122
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:25,519
We'll see her reaction
and, crossing our fingers,

123
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:27,732
I'm really hoping she does the
Pledge of Allegiance for me.

124
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:28,667
That would be so sweet.

125
00:04:28,667 --> 00:04:31,039
That would just be like really
satisfying, knowing that

126
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:33,469
I did a good job and she recites
the Pledge of Allegiance.

127
00:04:33,469 --> 00:04:35,302
(snaps)
That or the Flashdance.

128
00:04:35,302 --> 00:04:36,302
You know, the--

129
00:04:36,302 --> 00:04:38,718
(laughs)

130
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,189
- Jared just yelled at me.

131
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:43,249
- [Jared] I had the camera
pulled up and everything

132
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,686
so I wouldn't miss you.

133
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:45,519
- It's okay.

134
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,935
You did the cleaning!
- Yeah, I did.

135
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:48,949
- [Jackson] Mom!

136
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:50,685
- What do you think?
- This is so,

137
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:52,081
I mean, good!
- Yeah.

138
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,626
- [Ellie] It looks great.

139
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,238
- [Jared] I hope everything
is in it's right place.

140
00:04:56,238 --> 00:04:58,488
- I kind of love it better.

141
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,395
Like this is on the rug
- On the rug.

142
00:05:01,395 --> 00:05:02,541
- not on the wood floor.
- And then these are on.

143
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:05,077
- Yeah, I think we have the
rug a teeny bit different

144
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,874
and I like it.
- Yeah.

145
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:07,707
- Feels so good.

146
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,751
- Good!
- Thank you!

147
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:09,584
- You're welcome.

148
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,531
I just want it to be one less
thing you had to worry about

149
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:12,835
when you got home.
- Well, thanks.

150
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:13,668
(kisses)

151
00:05:13,668 --> 00:05:16,536
- I went to a church activity.

152
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,388
That's where I went.
- Yeah.

153
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:20,055
- But you know what?

154
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,620
Our neighbor, Piper,

155
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,287
she had her puppies.

156
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,578
Do you wanna go see them?

157
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:27,721
- Yeah.
- Okay.

158
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:29,065
- Let's go see some puppies.
- The puppies are

159
00:05:29,065 --> 00:05:30,610
several weeks old now, so I think it's--

160
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,545
- Can I hold them?
- I don't know.

161
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:33,690
We're just gonna pet them for now.

162
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,884
- Yeah, we're gonna look at them,

163
00:05:34,884 --> 00:05:35,860
- 'Cause they're so little.
- yeah.

164
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,449
Are you excited to see some puppies?

165
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:39,320
- Let's go look.
- Let's go look

166
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,948
at the puppies!

167
00:05:40,948 --> 00:05:41,888
- You think Penny's okay?

168
00:05:41,888 --> 00:05:42,721
- [Jared] Yeah, she's great.

169
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:43,569
We played with her really hard.

170
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:45,130
- Okay.
- We really, really did.

171
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:45,963
- Awesome.

172
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,690
- I'm like outta breath,
- You're workin' hard!

173
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,962
- I'm outta breath because
I played with her so hard

174
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,716
and then I did all this.

175
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:54,472
I was like, Joel, we've got 45
minutes to make this happen.

176
00:05:54,472 --> 00:05:55,982
And I think you've been gone
- I appreciate this.

177
00:05:55,982 --> 00:05:56,888
- for like an hour or so.

178
00:05:56,888 --> 00:05:58,881
Okay, I'm gonna get on my
shoes, you're out the door

179
00:05:58,881 --> 00:05:59,860
and I gotta get my shoes on.

180
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,193
- [Audience] Aw.

181
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:05,039
- Alright, so we're gettin'
towards the end of the night

182
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,467
and the kids are in the tub.

183
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:09,687
And sometimes when it's
really late, the kids'll be

184
00:06:09,687 --> 00:06:12,260
in the tub and I'll feed 'em some yogurt.

185
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,850
And Jackson's like, "Will
you feed us yogurt?"

186
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,683
I'm like, "Yeah."

187
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:16,503
So I'm sitting here feeding them yogurt

188
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,865
while they're playing,
and Jackson was going,

189
00:06:18,865 --> 00:06:21,304
"Me, me, me, me, me,"
when it was his turn.

190
00:06:21,304 --> 00:06:22,855
And then Calvin started doing that.

191
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:24,290
- [Calvin] Please?

192
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,918
- Yes, and so I said, "Jackson,"

193
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,260
- [Calvin] Please?

194
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,828
- you are a good example.

195
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:33,126
So if you say please
instead of "Me, me, me,"

196
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,169
Calvin will say please, and
that saying "Me, me, me"

197
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:38,169
is not nice.

198
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,252
And I said, "You need
to wait and say please."

199
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:43,953
So he started saying please
and I said, "See Jackson,

200
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:45,751
"you're such a good example."

201
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:49,016
And I said, "If you're nice
and kind, and you don't hit,

202
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:52,781
"and you don't bite, that means
that Calvin won't do that.

203
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,621
"Like, he will see--"
- Calvin bite me

204
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:56,785
when I didn't bitted him.

205
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,868
- And that's exactly
what he told me, he goes,

206
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:02,334
"But I don't bite and Calvin bites me."

207
00:07:02,334 --> 00:07:05,878
You are such a good
example, and sometimes he is

208
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:07,427
a little biter, huh?

209
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,744
- And a kicker.
- Oh yeah.

210
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:12,394
And we really try hard
not to do that, huh?

211
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:13,727
Right?
- But he--

212
00:07:14,796 --> 00:07:16,344
- He hurt your foot, huh?
- Well,

213
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:21,218
when he can run, we go
across to see the puppies,

214
00:07:21,218 --> 00:07:25,385
he was riding a scooter and
he fell off and got blood

215
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,113
and the owie is under his blood.

216
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:31,984
- Under the blood, yeah.

217
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,272
Calvin got a little owie on his foot, huh?

218
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:36,960
But I just, I laughed out
loud, because he was like

219
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,376
"But I don't bite and Calvin bites me."

220
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,354
(laughs)

221
00:07:40,354 --> 00:07:43,876
For the most part, Calvin's
really good to listen

222
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:46,539
and watch exactly what Jackson does.

223
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:47,872
And it's weird--

224
00:07:48,714 --> 00:07:52,838
It's just been nice having
two of the kids close in age.

225
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:57,603
Calvin just gets it 'cause
he sees Jackson, you know?

226
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,234
You are a good example.
- Me, me, me, me.

227
00:07:59,234 --> 00:08:02,354
- Even with potty time,
Jackson, it took a long time

228
00:08:02,354 --> 00:08:06,262
to get 'em comfortable to
even sit on the toilet,

229
00:08:06,262 --> 00:08:08,957
whereas Calvin already is
sitting on the toilet often

230
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:10,834
and sometimes even going.

231
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:13,031
And it's just been awesome.

232
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:16,088
He sees Jackson and he wants to do exactly

233
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:17,312
what his brother does.

234
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:19,275
So, we're saying please now

235
00:08:19,275 --> 00:08:22,126
instead of me, me, me, me, me.
- Please can I have

236
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,803
some more yogurt?

237
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,567
- Yes,
- Please?

238
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,424
- [Ellie] Please?

239
00:08:26,424 --> 00:08:29,348
Alright, who's gettin' out first?

240
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:31,191
Who's gettin' out first?

241
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,620
(laughs)

242
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,195
They usually point to each
other is what happens.

243
00:08:35,195 --> 00:08:37,030
Who's gettin' out first?

244
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,868
No, you no Calvin?

245
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,849
I think we should get you out first.

246
00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:42,967
- No.
(laughs)

247
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,394
- Usually I say, "Okay,
who's gettin' out first?"

248
00:08:44,394 --> 00:08:45,988
and they both always point to each other.

249
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,340
You're it today.

250
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,815
- No.
- Yes, you're getting out

251
00:08:48,815 --> 00:08:49,794
first, come on.

252
00:08:49,794 --> 00:08:51,302
- Okay, come on!

253
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:52,135
- Okay,

254
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:55,028
go play.

255
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:57,474
- Bye have fun!
- Bye (laughs).

256
00:08:57,474 --> 00:08:59,068
So I was getting Calvin
dressed, Jackson's like,

257
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:00,293
"You wanna play with me?

258
00:09:00,293 --> 00:09:01,126
"Come on."

259
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:02,088
And he said it like a hundred times.

260
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:04,169
So if I set the camera up
he might come in and do it

261
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,024
one more time.

262
00:09:05,024 --> 00:09:07,118
'Cause he was doing it so many times.

263
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:07,951
So cute!

264
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:12,238
We, how Jared and I are
feeling, we've been home

265
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:16,155
4 days now, 5 days, and
I don't know if jet lag

266
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,247
hits really bad on the third day?

267
00:09:20,247 --> 00:09:23,341
That's what Joel said,
and Joel knows everything,

268
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,174
by the way.

269
00:09:24,174 --> 00:09:25,795
So yes, I believe him.

270
00:09:25,795 --> 00:09:28,630
But really, like the third, fourth day,

271
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,131
or the third day, I really was feeling it.

272
00:09:31,131 --> 00:09:32,477
And today I'm feeling much better.

273
00:09:32,477 --> 00:09:35,762
I had a really slow start to
my day, but now I'm getting

274
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:37,311
ready for the night.

275
00:09:37,311 --> 00:09:38,948
I have a little bit more energy.

276
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:43,265
But I'm ready to have a
good night's rest tonight.

277
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:44,098
That's for sure.

278
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:46,115
Our house is getting put back together,

279
00:09:46,115 --> 00:09:47,458
the floors look great.

280
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:50,198
They look so, so much better.

281
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:52,360
We did a lot of, I think
we talked about this

282
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,031
on our house video, I don't
know how much we've talked

283
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:54,864
about it on the vlog.

284
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:58,947
But, we have a lot of
scratches and surface stuff

285
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:04,144
because when the yard wasn't done yet,

286
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:05,856
and Penny was coming in and
out and we were coming in

287
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:07,736
and out, there was a lot
of dirt and rock that got

288
00:10:07,736 --> 00:10:10,976
brought in the house, and I
just can tell a huge difference.

289
00:10:10,976 --> 00:10:14,315
It feels really fresh and
like it doesn't look dull

290
00:10:14,315 --> 00:10:15,764
especially right here.

291
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:17,153
So I'm really happy we did it.

292
00:10:17,153 --> 00:10:19,154
It was kind of a pain 'cause
we had to move everything,

293
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:21,645
but I wanted to get it
done sooner than later.

294
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:25,151
So I feel much better
and so grateful Jared

295
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,833
and Joel brought all the furniture in.

296
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,770
So nice of them.

297
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,534
Now I just have to get
this kitchen cleaned up.

298
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:31,937
One space at a time (laughs).

299
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:35,258
I'm slowly working on the
house, getting things organized

300
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:38,526
and decluttered and getting
ready for the holidays.

301
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,113
Can't believe Thanksgiving is next week.

302
00:10:40,113 --> 00:10:42,464
I love Thanksgiving.

303
00:10:42,464 --> 00:10:43,655
There's so many holidays, it's like,

304
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,163
"What's your favorite holiday?"

305
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:47,935
And I always love 4th of
July because it's just fun.

306
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,428
Like, families come
together, cooking outside,

307
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:53,568
it's hot, I love the
heat, swimming, I love

308
00:10:53,568 --> 00:10:54,466
the 4th of July.

309
00:10:54,466 --> 00:10:56,176
But there's something about Thanksgiving

310
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,525
that's really special too.

311
00:10:57,525 --> 00:10:59,250
So, I'm really excited for that.

312
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,935
- So with all of our China
footage, I've actually been

313
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:04,605
editing that still, and I've
been taking two or three days

314
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,240
and combining them into one vlog.

315
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,390
So, I have like, two hours
of footage every single night

316
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,728
that I combine down into
anywhere between 10 and 25

317
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:14,907
or so minutes.

318
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,958
And yesterday was our anniversary, yes!

319
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,708
So I didn't do any work that day.

320
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:24,365
And by the time Ellie
and I were ready for bed,

321
00:11:24,365 --> 00:11:26,196
that's when I started working.

322
00:11:26,196 --> 00:11:30,027
So I didn't end up
going to bed until 3:30,

323
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:33,251
and then I woke up at six to
get the kids ready for school

324
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,448
and for some other stuff
that we have goin' on today.

325
00:11:35,448 --> 00:11:38,612
It is now 7:45, I fell
asleep putting Calvin to bed.

326
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:40,438
So I am going to go to
bed and I'm gonna wake up

327
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:43,053
bright and early tomorrow
and edit this video.

328
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,194
(laughs)

329
00:11:44,194 --> 00:11:45,377
So, I'm gonna say goodnight.

330
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:47,212
I'm not sure if Ellie's
gonna say anything.

331
00:11:47,212 --> 00:11:48,717
She's with Jackson right
now, but if she does,

332
00:11:48,717 --> 00:11:49,941
she'll talk to you then.

333
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,397
If not, thanks for
watchin', have a good night.

334
00:11:52,397 --> 00:11:53,314
I'm zonked.

335
00:11:54,175 --> 00:00:00,000
(crash)
