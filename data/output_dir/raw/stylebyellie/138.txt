1
00:00:00,326 --> 00:00:02,394
- First of all, Jared and I are coming up

2
00:00:02,394 --> 00:00:04,578
on eight years of marriage.

3
00:00:04,578 --> 00:00:05,706
- Woo.

4
00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:08,690
- And I don't know why that's relevant.

5
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,882
I just think that we
should throw that in there.

6
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:12,239
I think it's cute,

7
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,313
and that this is so long ago.

8
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:16,585
So my sister Julie just did a video

9
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:18,882
where she tried on her old prom dress.

10
00:00:18,882 --> 00:00:21,881
So I have some old prom dresses here

11
00:00:21,881 --> 00:00:24,105
and then even two special ones

12
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:25,681
that I'll try on at the end.

13
00:00:25,681 --> 00:00:26,690
- Bonus.

14
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,346
- Let's go on with the very
first dress I ever wore,

15
00:00:29,346 --> 00:00:30,394
it was to a homecoming.

16
00:00:30,394 --> 00:00:33,106
And it, to this day, is my favorite dress.

17
00:00:33,106 --> 00:00:33,939
- This
- I'll try it on

18
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:34,772
- while you talk.

19
00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:36,627
- Okay, so the dress that Ellie's going

20
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:37,639
to start out with,

21
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:41,703
is the very first picture I saw of Ellie.

22
00:00:41,703 --> 00:00:44,015
I can't remember if it was on my mission

23
00:00:44,015 --> 00:00:46,983
with Landon and he had
pictures of your family.

24
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,303
I think that's where it was.

25
00:00:48,303 --> 00:00:51,436
But I saw the picture of
Ellie and I was just like wow,

26
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,124
she is beautiful.

27
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,838
And she was wearing this dress.

28
00:00:54,838 --> 00:00:56,529
And so it's like ingrained in my mind

29
00:00:56,529 --> 00:00:57,880
because it was the very first picture

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,176
I saw of Ellie,

31
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:01,685
so it's just a really
really beautiful dress.

32
00:01:01,685 --> 00:01:02,866
- [Ellie] Close your eyes.

33
00:01:02,866 --> 00:01:03,699
Woo.

34
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,596
- Tell me when I can open them.

35
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,705
- [Ellie] Here, you hold
up the picture to them.

36
00:01:07,705 --> 00:01:10,846
- So this is the picture of Ellie at prom,

37
00:01:10,846 --> 00:01:13,828
or one of the dances, homecoming.

38
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:16,296
And then this is her
wearing the dress again.

39
00:01:16,296 --> 00:01:17,129
- Laaaa.

40
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,921
- It looks really good Ellie.

41
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:20,754
- Thanks.

42
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:25,290
And it's been cleaned and
put away in closets forever.

43
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,123
- Yeah.

44
00:01:26,123 --> 00:01:27,186
- And I think on our cruise,

45
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:28,524
I should've brought it on our cruise,

46
00:01:28,524 --> 00:01:29,546
so I could've worn it.

47
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:30,746
- Yeah that would've been really fun.

48
00:01:30,746 --> 00:01:32,472
- Yeah, it's really cute.

49
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:33,572
- I think it looks better on you now.

50
00:01:33,572 --> 00:01:37,978
- I think for the day I had
it pinned just a little.

51
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:40,262
- Yeah, no yeah, I can
see that in the picture.

52
00:01:40,262 --> 00:01:41,095
- Yeah.

53
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,906
Aww, there it is.
- Look how good you look.

54
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,424
- I love the sparkles on the bottom.

55
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,095
- Okay, next dress.

56
00:01:48,095 --> 00:01:50,148
Really I'm just here to go down
memory lane with you Ellie.

57
00:01:50,148 --> 00:01:51,461
I don't really have any part of this.

58
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,062
Do you need me to zip you up on this one.

59
00:01:53,062 --> 00:01:53,895
- Yes.

60
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:56,046
(laughs)

61
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:58,414
Did this really fit me then?

62
00:01:58,414 --> 00:02:00,038
(laughing)

63
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,461
This is awkward.

64
00:02:01,461 --> 00:02:03,118
So I wore this dress twice.

65
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:04,262
You can show them.

66
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,386
- There's that one time.

67
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:07,841
And then there's that time.

68
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,842
- And we actually came up to here,

69
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,451
to this town to buy this dress.

70
00:02:11,451 --> 00:02:12,284
- Oh wow.

71
00:02:12,284 --> 00:02:13,117
- With Mom.

72
00:02:13,117 --> 00:02:14,993
With Mom and Bonnie.

73
00:02:14,993 --> 00:02:15,826
Cute.
- Yeah.

74
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:17,032
- And I love the pick ups in it.

75
00:02:17,032 --> 00:02:17,865
And this pretty much looked

76
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,872
just like my wedding dress, but white.

77
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:21,304
- Yep.

78
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:22,984
- And I just rented my wedding dress,

79
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,144
I don't have it.

80
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:24,977
Isn't that cute?

81
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:25,810
- Yeah I like it.

82
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,122
- It was a really
different color of green.

83
00:02:28,122 --> 00:02:28,955
This was two years apart,

84
00:02:28,955 --> 00:02:31,114
so you can see one picture
I had really short bangs,

85
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:32,394
and then the other picture

86
00:02:32,394 --> 00:02:33,869
was the year before we got married.

87
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,935
Oh this was my senior year,
so then we got married--

88
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:36,768
- Right after that

89
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:39,017
- We were dating, so the story about this,

90
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,761
Jared and I were actually dating

91
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,209
when I went to my prom.

92
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,185
And he felt and I felt,

93
00:02:44,185 --> 00:02:45,018
like it was very mutual,

94
00:02:45,018 --> 00:02:46,073
like you need to go to your prom,

95
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:49,122
you need to like be in high
school and do your thing

96
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:49,955
and then when you're done,

97
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:52,490
we'll really be serious and date.

98
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,834
But what did you think?

99
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:55,629
- I was in love with you.

100
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,876
- Well tell me, like what did you think

101
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,134
- When you went to prom?
- When I went to prom, yeah.

102
00:02:59,134 --> 00:03:00,810
- Well I didn't think much of it,

103
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,823
because I knew you were just
gonna call me right afterwards,

104
00:03:03,823 --> 00:03:05,052
and we were gonna talk, so.

105
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:05,885
I thought it was important

106
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,163
that you went to your senior prom,

107
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:09,074
so of course you went.

108
00:03:09,074 --> 00:03:10,313
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

109
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:11,268
- There we go.

110
00:03:11,268 --> 00:03:12,101
- You look good.

111
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,934
- Thanks.

112
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:13,767
- You look like a little lime.

113
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:14,982
- This next one,

114
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:16,150
is a real doozy.

115
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,983
- Ooh.

116
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,702
- Okay, I have to preference this dress.

117
00:03:18,702 --> 00:03:20,261
We're both cringing.

118
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:22,678
Okay, this was Bonnie's dress

119
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:26,234
and I wore it to two dances.

120
00:03:26,234 --> 00:03:28,651
Bonnie is very large chested,

121
00:03:28,651 --> 00:03:31,779
so how come I tried to fit into this,

122
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,712
I don't know what my parents were,

123
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:35,436
I guess, just sweet enough to just think

124
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,411
oh she feels good in it, let her wear it.

125
00:03:37,411 --> 00:03:38,887
So when Bonnie wore this dress,

126
00:03:38,887 --> 00:03:40,511
it just came like this.

127
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,472
But my Mom said, I think
you should put something

128
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,679
on the sleeves, so it's, you know,

129
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,086
a little more modest.

130
00:03:45,086 --> 00:03:46,350
These are like the wimpiest,

131
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,247
see-throughest, ugliest
sleeves in the world.

132
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:50,517
And I think

133
00:03:50,517 --> 00:03:52,430
- But good for your mom to do that, right?

134
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,598
- Yes, I just don't think
it's flattering at all.

135
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,526
And now I can fill it in a little better.

136
00:03:57,526 --> 00:03:58,695
But at the time,

137
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,382
I was like, trying to do this

138
00:04:00,382 --> 00:04:01,950
and hold it with my chest,

139
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,109
so it didn't like fall down.

140
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:05,694
You know, it's like oh brother,

141
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,687
you can show them the pictures.

142
00:04:07,687 --> 00:04:09,181
- And you wore it two different times.

143
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,716
- [Ellie] Yes, to different proms.

144
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:12,625
- Ellie, you went to a lot of dances.

145
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:14,128
(laughs)

146
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:14,994
Okay do a spin.

147
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:16,577
- Okay, here we go.

148
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,651
It's not my favorite.

149
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:21,262
It's kind of funny that it was Bonnie's

150
00:04:21,262 --> 00:04:23,104
and then everyone tried to wear it.

151
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,021
And that's what it was.

152
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:28,081
- So the dress that
Ellie's gonna put on now

153
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:29,857
has some pretty special meaning to me

154
00:04:29,857 --> 00:04:31,105
along with the first dress.

155
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,424
They're kind of firsts.

156
00:04:32,424 --> 00:04:34,569
The first dress was when I first saw Ellie

157
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:37,366
and this dress I think
is when we both knew

158
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:39,029
that we were in love with each other.

159
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:39,862
- [Ellie] Totally.

160
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,847
- So come on out, show 'em.

161
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,180
- Ahhhh.
- Woooo.

162
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:45,296
(laughs)

163
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:49,870
- This dress was when my
sister Julie got married.

164
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,953
And I'm surprised and
shocked that it still fits.

165
00:04:54,822 --> 00:04:56,758
It was during the holiday season,

166
00:04:56,758 --> 00:05:00,127
so it's red and sparkly
and really fun for a party.

167
00:05:00,127 --> 00:05:02,823
And I wore some sort
of black shawl with it.

168
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:06,126
- But this dress she wore
to her sister's wedding.

169
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:07,542
And that was the time

170
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:10,316
that Ellie and I, we were
dating some other people

171
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:13,171
off and on, but that was
like when we were like,

172
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,387
no,
- I really like you.

173
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:15,459
- We're gonna date each other.

174
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,817
- And it just happened.

175
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:17,650
- Yeah.

176
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,163
- We left there just being like,

177
00:05:19,163 --> 00:05:21,051
we love each other.

178
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,482
And it was not like anything crazy,

179
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:25,136
we just were with each other, we hung out,

180
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,599
and we didn't want to
not be with each other.

181
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:30,053
- And then 11 months
later, we got married.

182
00:05:30,053 --> 00:05:30,886
(gasps)

183
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:32,259
- Isn't that weird?

184
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:34,957
11 months before I was married.

185
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:35,928
Woo, kay.

186
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,221
- And we're in love still.

187
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:38,354
(laughs)

188
00:05:38,354 --> 00:05:39,478
We're still in love.

189
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:40,379
Whoa, baby.

190
00:05:40,379 --> 00:05:41,302
(laughs)

191
00:05:41,302 --> 00:05:42,141
Woo!

192
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,541
- Next up, my mom's prom dress.

193
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:45,928
- Ooh is this one of the bonus ones?

194
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,761
- Yes.

195
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:47,759
- Oh fun.

196
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,410
Okay, we're having a flashback.

197
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,243
- This

198
00:05:51,243 --> 00:05:52,537
- It's very

199
00:05:52,537 --> 00:05:54,620
- is my mom's prom dress.

200
00:05:55,585 --> 00:05:56,577
- Come a little closer.

201
00:05:56,577 --> 00:05:58,832
- And it has been hanging up

202
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,718
in our closets for years.

203
00:06:01,718 --> 00:06:02,589
And my mom was so sweet.

204
00:06:02,589 --> 00:06:03,781
When I told her I was doing this,

205
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,494
she said, you should try on my prom dress.

206
00:06:05,494 --> 00:06:08,969
I was like, okay and I want
to be very careful with it.

207
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,802
My mom's mom made this

208
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:14,918
for my mom for her prom.

209
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:16,688
Like look at the detail

210
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:18,225
- of this.
- It's very elegant.

211
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:21,081
- She made this shawl to go with it.

212
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,291
Isn't that beautiful?

213
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,379
- It's pretty, yeah, it's very pretty.

214
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:25,733
- Like every stitching on it,

215
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,485
I'm just like, my grandma did that

216
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:29,133
and it looks so nice.

217
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,151
- You have to think about it this way,

218
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:32,314
like how late did she stay up

219
00:06:32,314 --> 00:06:33,218
sowing this for your mom?

220
00:06:33,218 --> 00:06:36,301
- Yeah and my grandma had
cancer all while my mom

221
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,999
was growing up, she was very sick,

222
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,724
so I think just knowing that

223
00:06:39,724 --> 00:06:42,178
and knowing she made this is so

224
00:06:42,178 --> 00:06:43,253
- So special.
- Special, yeah.

225
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:44,468
- It's beautiful, the color's beautiful.

226
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:45,802
the white and orange.

227
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:49,260
If I was smart, I probably
should've worn this

228
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,243
to one of my proms.

229
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,202
How cute would that have been?

230
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:53,902
But how cute, huh?
- Yeah, it looks really great.

231
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:54,735
- I love it.

232
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,293
Thanks Mom, for letting me try it on.

233
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,917
So those are some special
dresses that I have worn.

234
00:06:58,917 --> 00:06:59,934
It's funny that we have these

235
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,484
and I don't have my wedding dress,

236
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,932
but we didn't buy our wedding dress.

237
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:06,899
- It just wasn't that
important, our wedding.

238
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:07,893
(laughing)

239
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:10,599
- Well I think it was
just cheaper to rent.

240
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,432
- Yeah.

241
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:15,127
- And I don't regret it, I rented it.

242
00:07:15,127 --> 00:07:17,926
I think the only one who
bought it was Bonnie,

243
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:20,290
bought her dress and it
was beautiful as well,

244
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,351
and I have a picture of it

245
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:23,079
and that's awesome.

246
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,088
- My sister Melanie
bought her wedding dress.

247
00:07:26,088 --> 00:07:28,347
I don't think she wished she did.

248
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:29,974
I think she wished she would've rented it.

249
00:07:29,974 --> 00:07:30,902
I'll have to ask her.

250
00:07:30,902 --> 00:07:33,003
But this was fun for me to be a part of,

251
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,509
I'm sorry if I kinda was
just like a fly on the wall

252
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:36,491
and just like hey,

253
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,324
- It was cute.

254
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,291
- look at this memory lane prom dress

255
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:40,649
try on session.

256
00:07:40,649 --> 00:07:42,132
- Let me ask you one question,

257
00:07:42,132 --> 00:07:43,587
is there one thing
about any of your dances

258
00:07:43,587 --> 00:07:44,807
that stick out.

259
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:47,359
- I mean I think senior
prom was the most fun

260
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:50,440
that I had, because our
closest group of friends

261
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,861
that we all went together with,

262
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,354
that was a ton of fun.

263
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:55,448
And they had it at this really cool place,

264
00:07:55,448 --> 00:07:56,750
so it wasn't at the school.

265
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,000
- That was fun.
- So I think that was fun.

266
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,060
- I had another winter
formal that I went to

267
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,569
while I was in Washington,

268
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,585
that I was invited to in Utah

269
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,035
but it wasn't with you,

270
00:08:07,035 --> 00:08:08,139
it was before I even knew you.

271
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,056
So I flew to Utah for a

272
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,636
- Which boggles my mind.

273
00:08:12,636 --> 00:08:14,630
It's cute, it's cute that
your parents let you.

274
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,561
I don't know if my parents
would ever let me do that.

275
00:08:16,561 --> 00:08:17,689
- I don't know.

276
00:08:17,689 --> 00:08:20,576
Not too many years people
as cool as me go to proms

277
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:22,416
outside of their own state, right?

278
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,741
- That's cool, that's fun.

279
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,070
- That's kinda like weird
for me to say, I'm sorry.

280
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,702
But those are just things
that I have memories of, so.

281
00:08:28,702 --> 00:08:29,535
- How fun.

282
00:08:29,535 --> 00:08:30,368
- Yeah.

283
00:08:30,368 --> 00:08:32,529
What was your coolest
and worst memory of prom?

284
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:33,687
- I don't think I have a worst memory.

285
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,192
I think they were all really fun.

286
00:08:35,192 --> 00:08:37,123
I think that everyone I was with

287
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,674
was always just very
nice and fun to be with

288
00:08:39,674 --> 00:08:41,049
and I always had fun.

289
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:42,730
You know, for a few of the dances,

290
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,106
like you do an activity before

291
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,706
and we would go shooting.

292
00:08:45,706 --> 00:08:49,109
So for a lot, like we'd go
shotgun shooting, like pigeons,

293
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:49,990
you know, like laser tag,

294
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,873
we would do stuff like that.

295
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:53,449
- Okay, here's one thing I remember.

296
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,032
You hated going bowling before,

297
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,241
for your activity.

298
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,323
I remember you calling me on the phone

299
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:04,407
and talking about, like you have this date

300
00:09:04,407 --> 00:09:05,998
coming up, like this prom date,

301
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:08,223
and you're going bowling
for your date activity

302
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:10,544
and you're just like, I
don't want to go bowling

303
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,209
for my date activity,

304
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:15,507
which is funny, because
I enjoy bowling so much.

305
00:09:15,507 --> 00:09:17,838
- I don't remember that at all,

306
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:18,671
that's funny.
- Yeah, yeah.

307
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:19,809
- That's funny, huh.

308
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,984
Oh my gosh, it's fun to
go back down memory lane

309
00:09:22,984 --> 00:09:23,857
and think about the things

310
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,248
that you were thinking

311
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:26,304
and the things you said,

312
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:29,023
and just how they compare to now.

313
00:09:29,023 --> 00:09:30,700
Because we would go
bowling in a heartbeat.

314
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,533
- Yeah.

315
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:32,366
- And we would have fun.

316
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,234
- I was a dork.

317
00:09:33,234 --> 00:09:34,377
- You still kinda are.

318
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:35,601
It's alright, I love you.

319
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,595
- You dork.
- That's funny.

320
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,642
- Well that is the prom dresses

321
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:40,486
that I have tried on.

322
00:09:40,486 --> 00:09:42,645
I hope you enjoyed this video.

323
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:44,838
This was fun to do, love you.

324
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:45,671
- Love you.

325
00:09:45,671 --> 00:09:47,450
- That green one was kind of funny.

326
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,211
I think it was hilarious
that it was Bonnie's.

327
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:50,886
Bonnie had a completely
different body type

328
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:52,230
than any of us, and
all of us sisters tried

329
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,573
to wear it because at the time it was like

330
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:55,791
beautiful.
- This is nice.

331
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,279
- This is a sweet dress.

332
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,749
- Okay, we'll see you guys later.

333
00:09:59,749 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
- Bye.
