1
00:00:01,926 --> 00:00:03,394
- [Jared] You ready for this?

2
00:00:03,394 --> 00:00:04,807
- Yeah!

3
00:00:04,807 --> 00:00:07,390
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,926
- K, ready, Jar?

5
00:00:13,926 --> 00:00:15,878
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready,

6
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:17,383
by the grace of everything.

7
00:00:17,383 --> 00:00:18,887
- Let me get a little water.

8
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:20,603
- [Ellie] K, get in a sip, and then--

9
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:23,208
- Make sure you stay hydrated, young man.

10
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:24,525
- Gonna get a drink, and
then we're gonna head out.

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:27,783
We have been working the last few days

12
00:00:27,783 --> 00:00:30,593
from eight A.M. 'til six at night.

13
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:32,916
We've been filming some
really fun projects.

14
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,230
Today, we are finishing
up one of those projects.

15
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,403
It is a giving.

16
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:39,584
It is a service project
that we were able to work

17
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:42,361
with a company and combine
and do something really big

18
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:43,988
for some fun people.

19
00:00:43,988 --> 00:00:45,252
That's where we're going right now

20
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,783
after we fight over the water.

21
00:00:46,783 --> 00:00:48,196
We're all gonna get in the car,

22
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:51,134
and we're gonna head out
and surprise some families,

23
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,263
and I'm really excited to do that.

24
00:00:53,263 --> 00:00:55,846
(gentle music)

25
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:58,112
- [Jared] Good donut?

26
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,378
- So good. You want a bite?

27
00:00:59,378 --> 00:01:01,795
- [Jared] Yes, I want a bite.

28
00:01:05,846 --> 00:01:06,899
- [Ellie] Oh, you got donut.

29
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,351
- He's like mouthful already.

30
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,869
Oh, wow, let me have another bite.

31
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:12,078
- This is the best donut.

32
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:13,728
It's like a scone.

33
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,837
- Yeah, it's so stinking good.

34
00:01:15,837 --> 00:01:17,109
- It's just like a scone.

35
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:19,040
- [Jared] Yeah, that's a sconut.

36
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,873
Ooh.

37
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:23,142
- [Jackson] Dad, the cape.

38
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:25,725
(gentle music)

39
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:31,267
- [Ellie] Come here, come here, come here.

40
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:32,247
- [Jared] Come here, boys.

41
00:01:32,247 --> 00:01:33,080
Hi, Jackson.

42
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,082
- [Ellie] Are we gonna get ready?

43
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:34,915
- [Jared] You ready for this?

44
00:01:34,915 --> 00:01:36,248
- Yeah!

45
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:37,864
- [Jared] Hi, Cal.

46
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:38,697
Hi, bud.

47
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:39,890
- [Woman] Guess it will
look right in here.

48
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:40,723
- [Ellie] Yeah, it's
good in the middle, but--

49
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:41,616
- [Jared] Hi.

50
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:45,101
Jackson, you are doing so
good with the snowflake.

51
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:48,049
You're following the lines and everything.

52
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,154
Good job, bud.

53
00:01:49,154 --> 00:01:51,737
(gentle music)

54
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:01,359
Ellie, I could never
make a gingerbread house

55
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,511
like these guys.

56
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,603
Like, look at that.

57
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,011
- [Ellie] That's fun.

58
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,882
- It's the teamwork that
makes the dream work.

59
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:07,729
- There you go.

60
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:09,595
That's a lesson to live by.

61
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,009
Yeah, you put that on a t-shirt.

62
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:12,637
Sell it on Teespring.com.

63
00:02:12,637 --> 00:02:13,609
(crosstalk)

64
00:02:13,609 --> 00:02:14,912
Blah, blah, blah.

65
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,819
Blah, blah, blah.

66
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:16,652
- My dad.

67
00:02:16,652 --> 00:02:17,485
- Yours?

68
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:18,318
- Yeah.

69
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:21,514
- Well, find it, and that
is a wrap on the day.

70
00:02:21,514 --> 00:02:23,194
That is a wrap on the day.

71
00:02:23,194 --> 00:02:24,759
We are all done.

72
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,228
(laughs)

73
00:02:26,228 --> 00:02:28,035
Ellie's wrapping up with some pie.

74
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:29,452
- Yes, pie, soup.

75
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,551
We are pooped.

76
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:34,667
- Pooped.

77
00:02:34,667 --> 00:02:38,129
We're at The Pie Dump, and
we're pooped eating pie.

78
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:39,194
- Poopoo.

79
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:42,037
- That's the cutest name
for a restaurant: Pie Dump.

80
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,270
- Yeah, The Pie Dump.

81
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,488
Well, and what we didn't
know until today is, like,

82
00:02:45,488 --> 00:02:48,034
Joel would come here all the time.

83
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,073
They have the best rolls.

84
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:51,827
They have amazing pies, and,
everyone in the community,

85
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:54,907
this is their hangout, which is so fun.

86
00:02:54,907 --> 00:02:56,279
We're gonna have to come here more often.

87
00:02:56,279 --> 00:02:58,164
- Yes, so far so good.

88
00:02:58,164 --> 00:03:00,472
(laughs)

89
00:03:00,472 --> 00:03:03,518
Remember how little she was a year ago?

90
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,315
Like, under the tree and fireplace.

91
00:03:05,315 --> 00:03:07,431
She was just under the couch.

92
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:10,876
- I remember the first picture
we took was right here,

93
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,775
her looking up right here.

94
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,920
She would fit underneath the couch.

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,517
- [Ellie] Now, she's chomping on a treat.

96
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:18,588
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

97
00:03:18,588 --> 00:03:19,560
- [Ellie] Those little
things are the coolest.

98
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,166
It's like a ball that you put a treat in,

99
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,935
and it occupies her.

100
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:23,768
- Yeah, well, it's--

101
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:24,601
- [Ellie] For a minute.

102
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:27,613
- It's a little mental
and physical stimulation.

103
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:29,425
She's had such a fun day.

104
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:32,210
She's been playing with
her buddies all day today

105
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,710
at doggie daycare.

106
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:37,094
- Yeah, she went to a little daycare today

107
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:41,314
while we finished filming,
because today was sun up

108
00:03:41,314 --> 00:03:43,415
'til sun down filming.

109
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:45,491
We brought you along a little bit.

110
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,385
I don't even know if it made sense.

111
00:03:47,385 --> 00:03:49,579
We had a really fun day.

112
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,959
We're gonna have a main
video of that coming out

113
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,836
in the few weeks, I think, but--

114
00:03:53,836 --> 00:03:55,855
- We'll let you know for sure
exactly when it's coming out

115
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:57,019
so you can be ready for it.
- Yes.

116
00:03:57,019 --> 00:03:59,333
She got the treat out of the.

117
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,537
(laughs)

118
00:04:01,537 --> 00:04:03,180
- That took 30 seconds.

119
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,787
- Our vlogs the last
few days have not been

120
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:08,123
the typical vlogs at home,
but we have been working on

121
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,737
some side projects that
have been really fun

122
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:12,873
that will go up in a couple of weeks.

123
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:13,887
We are home now.

124
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,021
The kids are in bed.

125
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:18,047
Our minds, our mental
stimulation the last few days

126
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:20,720
of filming has been overwhelming but fun.

127
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,039
It's been fun to see
there's just so many jobs,

128
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:26,085
and it's just fun.

129
00:04:26,085 --> 00:04:27,435
Oh, she found her toy.

130
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,289
She found her toy.

131
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,339
Was that on the counter?

132
00:04:29,339 --> 00:04:31,492
- [Jared] It was on her bed, I think.

133
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:32,415
- You find your toy.

134
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:34,889
It was fun to see, but
our house was filled

135
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:37,463
with, like, 15 crew people
and all these cameras

136
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:41,137
and equipment, and I just was thinking,

137
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:42,096
"Look at all these jobs they have".

138
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:45,570
Look at all the jobs that
people have coordinating

139
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,355
even, like, what we did
this weekend and then us,

140
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:52,321
and it just was a really
cool experience for us,

141
00:04:52,321 --> 00:04:56,665
and Penny really likes this
experience of her new toy.

142
00:04:56,665 --> 00:04:59,894
Side note, Magna-Tiles,
we've had those for a year

143
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:03,597
and a half, and the boys
literally have been playing

144
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:06,898
with them for hours, and
she just got a diaper.

145
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:08,676
They've been playing with them for hours

146
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,199
building garages for their cars.

147
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,332
So cute.

148
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:15,201
- And it's funny, because
it just clicked for Jackson.

149
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,923
He's like, "Okay, I can
have fun and build things

150
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:21,087
"with these toys," so it's
like we had them for so long,

151
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:22,832
but, now, he's so interested in 'em,

152
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:25,106
and I wanna say the next
progression after that

153
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:26,347
is gonna be LEGO.

154
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:27,460
You know, Magna-Tiles, then maybe LEGOS.

155
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,330
- I hope so.

156
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,163
I kinda keep--
- I know.

157
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:30,198
I'm kinda crossing my fingers for that.

158
00:05:30,198 --> 00:05:31,782
- We have a little box of LEGOS downstairs

159
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:34,385
that my mom got out when
she was with the kids,

160
00:05:34,385 --> 00:05:36,365
and she's like, "They
actually really liked 'em,"

161
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:38,714
and he's been liking carrying
'em around in baggies,

162
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,857
but he likes holding 'em,
but he doesn't really like

163
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:43,682
playing with them a whole ton.

164
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:45,039
That could be the next step.

165
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,757
I think LEGOS are fun.

166
00:05:46,757 --> 00:05:49,135
- What are the Du, Duplo, Duplox?

167
00:05:49,135 --> 00:05:50,223
Is that like the bigger LEGO?

168
00:05:50,223 --> 00:05:51,056
- [Ellie] I think so.

169
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:51,889
- I don't know. I don't know.

170
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,447
- I don't know, but these are cool.

171
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,902
We have a small set of 'em.

172
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:56,735
- [Jared] We need to get more.

173
00:05:56,735 --> 00:05:57,976
- That is our vlog, guys.

174
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,634
Thank you so much for watching.

175
00:05:59,634 --> 00:06:01,223
Like I said, it's kinda
been a little funny

176
00:06:01,223 --> 00:06:04,282
the last few days, but we're
getting into Thanksgiving,

177
00:06:04,282 --> 00:06:06,580
and I'm very excited.

178
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,464
- [Jared] Do you wanna know something?

179
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:08,297
- What?

180
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:09,130
- I'm grateful for you.

181
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,443
- [Ellie] Thank you.

182
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:14,596
- I was gonna say, like, "Do
you wanna know something,"

183
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:17,384
and it's gonna be this
long, mystical thought.

184
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,712
Nope, I'm just grateful for you.

185
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,364
- Thank you, and I truly
am grateful for you,

186
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,041
and we're not, like, it's so funny,

187
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:25,879
'cause, when you first
say it, I'm like, "Ugh,"

188
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:28,861
but I know you mean it, because
you say that a lot to me.

189
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:29,796
- I want you to know that
I'm grateful for you.

190
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,874
- And I am grateful for you.

191
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:33,004
- You know, I want you to know that,

192
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:35,538
and I want you to know that
I'm grateful for her, too,

193
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:37,740
because I am so much.

194
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,573
(laughs)

195
00:06:38,573 --> 00:06:39,664
- K, guys.
- We're so weird.

196
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:42,071
- Roll your eyes, 'cause
I rolled mine halfway.

197
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:43,018
I do love you.

198
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:43,851
- Well, I love you too.

199
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:45,006
- And we're gonna go take a hot bath.

200
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:46,839
We're gonna put our feet in the bath, k.

201
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,939
- Put our feet in the bath.

202
00:06:47,939 --> 00:00:00,000
- We'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
- Bye!
