1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
- Then I am going to kick
Jared's butt here in a minute.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,300
- How can there be so many calories in

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,660
a Krispy Kreme Donut, when it's like air?

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,484
- I was this close to
passing out this morning.

5
00:00:10,484 --> 00:00:11,890
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,060
- We are not perfect, we are normal,

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,970
we are a fun, functional,
and dysfunctional family.

8
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,500
I am sick.

9
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:22,333
Jackson.

10
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:24,377
- I just may have yelled at everybody.

11
00:00:24,377 --> 00:00:25,210
(laughing)

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,270
- It is one of those mornings,

13
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,780
a morning where we all have to get ready

14
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,320
out of the house at a certain time.

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,670
And not everyone is
agreeing with that now.

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,320
You've got a smile on your face now.

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,360
Are you looking at yourself?

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,302
Yay Jackson.
- Calvin look at mom.

19
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,150
He's so mad that I did his hair.

20
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,963
- [Jared] Your hair looks so good.

21
00:00:40,963 --> 00:00:42,870
- No, I want it off.

22
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,000
- [Ellie] Ok, we'll take it off.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,290
- [Jared] Oh there we go, okay it's off.

24
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,540
It's better now; you good?

25
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,373
(laughing)

26
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:50,220
We're all getting ready
to go because we are going

27
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,300
to the doctor to hear our
sweet little baby's heartbeat.

28
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,840
We should probably pick a name.

29
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,050
Oooh, that looks good, whatcha makin'?

30
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,060
- Soup.

31
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:58,893
- [Jared] Soup?

32
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,020
- I mean spaghetti.

33
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,900
- [Jared] Oh spaghetti,
yum, that sounds delicious.

34
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,495
Do you have enough for everyone?

35
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:05,552
- I do.

36
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:06,385
- [Jared] Good.

37
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:07,397
- There's one, two,
three, four, five, six,

38
00:01:07,397 --> 00:01:08,920
seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

39
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,930
- [Jared] Oh perfect,
just the right amount.

40
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,484
Is it all done?

41
00:01:12,484 --> 00:01:13,317
- Yup.

42
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:15,460
- [Jared] Alright, there's my bowl.

43
00:01:16,782 --> 00:01:17,615
Oh, good.

44
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,915
That looks delicious, is it good?

45
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,748
- Yeah.

46
00:01:22,748 --> 00:01:23,670
- Can I have some in my bowl?

47
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:26,598
Thank you.

48
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:28,480
(slurping)

49
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,730
That is good.

50
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,620
That is so tasty.

51
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,815
Are you finding the right pathway?

52
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:34,880
- [Calvin] Yeah.

53
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,460
- [Jared] Good, you're almost there.

54
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,661
Yay, you did it.

55
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:39,550
- [Calvin] Oh.

56
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,680
- [Jared] Oh, you gotta get
it through that one now.

57
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,776
That one's kinda tough, huh?

58
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:45,750
- [Calvin] It's stuck.

59
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,250
- [Jared] Yeah, it's stuck.

60
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,427
Where's the baby?

61
00:01:48,427 --> 00:01:49,750
- In there.

62
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,189
- [Jared] There's the baby.

63
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:53,520
(kissing)

64
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,910
- Come here, Cal.

65
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,640
- [Jared] You're our baby right now, huh?

66
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,196
- Was mommy mad today?

67
00:01:58,196 --> 00:01:59,029
- Yup.

68
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:01,690
- I won't be mad no more, okay.

69
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:03,230
- [Jared] Were you mad today, Calvin?

70
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,793
- We were a little mad?

71
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:05,626
- No.

72
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,735
- [Jared] Uh, yeah.

73
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,146
- Here to help the baby?

74
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:11,258
- Yup.

75
00:02:11,258 --> 00:02:13,069
- [Jackson] What's that one?

76
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,220
- They're checking it to
make sure everything is good.

77
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,798
- [Jared] Do you want
to sit up there Jackson?

78
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:18,790
- I've got the fuzziest belly.

79
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,640
- [Nurse] That happens.

80
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,350
- I was like, oh!

81
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,390
- [Nurse] Really, I can't even see it.

82
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,270
- Peach fuzz.

83
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,840
- [Nurse] Sorry, I know that's cold.

84
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,735
Sometimes it takes just a minute.

85
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:30,568
(ultrasound whooshing)

86
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:32,816
To find where they're tucked.

87
00:02:32,816 --> 00:02:34,477
(baby's heart beating)

88
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:35,896
Do you hear it?

89
00:02:35,896 --> 00:02:37,728
So cool isn't it?

90
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:38,690
- That's his heartbeat, Jax.

91
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,760
- [Nurse] That's what your
heart sounds like too.

92
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,840
- Can you hear him?

93
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:47,790
- [Nurse] Oh, did that feel cold?

94
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,720
Do you want to wipe
your finger on a tissue?

95
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,250
Or did you just do it on your mom's tummy?

96
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:53,525
- He's like, I wiped it on her pants.

97
00:02:53,525 --> 00:02:54,759
- That's great.

98
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,706
- Yeah!

99
00:02:55,706 --> 00:02:57,648
- [Ellie] Is that the baby's heartbeat?

100
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:58,481
- Do you hear that?

101
00:02:58,481 --> 00:02:59,585
- Yep.

102
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:01,260
- Good, what did it sound like?

103
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,093
- A baby!

104
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:04,172
- A baby, can you make that sound?

105
00:03:04,172 --> 00:03:05,670
- Wooshoo.

106
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,080
- Can you do that Jackson?

107
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,722
Go shoo, shoo, shoo.

108
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,555
- Shoo, shoo, shoo

109
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:10,680
- [Jared] Yeah

110
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,430
Jackson, you were such a good helper.

111
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,890
- That made me so happy
that he wanted to sit by me.

112
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,723
- [Jared] I know

113
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:17,556
- He was like not going to get down.

114
00:03:17,556 --> 00:03:18,799
I was like, you can sit by me!

115
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,590
- [Jared] It was so sweet.

116
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,369
- We've been talking about
him all day today, huh?

117
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,202
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

118
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:26,570
- [Jared] Hey what do you
want to name the baby?

119
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,623
- Mason Cody.

120
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:30,591
- [Jared] Mason Cody.

121
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:31,424
- Mason Cody.

122
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,137
- [Jared] You just like
the name Cody, huh?

123
00:03:33,137 --> 00:03:33,970
- Yeah.

124
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,803
- [Jared] Yeah.

125
00:03:34,803 --> 00:03:35,636
- So, our morning was a little cray cray.

126
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:36,670
- What's a cray cray?

127
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,210
- It's just a little crazy.

128
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,503
We've had a crazy morning,
but it was so fun.

129
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:42,666
(baby jabbering)

130
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:43,499
Did you meet a friend here?

131
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:45,484
What was his name, you met a friend.

132
00:03:45,484 --> 00:03:46,317
- Lincoln.

133
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:47,150
- Lincoln.

134
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,300
And it's just fun when
you meet other couples

135
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,150
that you mesh with.

136
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,860
Like we were just in the waiting area,

137
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,150
and we were talking
with Lincoln's parents,

138
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,440
and you were playing with him,

139
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,370
and we're going to have a play date.

140
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,907
We're gonna all do dinner together.

141
00:03:59,907 --> 00:04:03,370
We exchanged numbers, and
were like friends now.

142
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,715
It's just funny how days, you know,

143
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:07,130
it can be overwhelming one minute

144
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,259
and then the next
- The next minute

145
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,463
just change.

146
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:10,660
- It's good, you know?

147
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,300
- [Jared] You having a hard time?

148
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,390
- Okay, I've never done
maternity photo, ever.

149
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,329
- [Jared] Never.

150
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,969
- I mean, we've taken a bajillion.

151
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,120
- We've taken a lot of photos,

152
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,570
but you've never had a
maternity photo shoot.

153
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,924
- Maternity session, and
I really want to do that.

154
00:04:23,924 --> 00:04:24,757
- [Jared] Right.

155
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:26,760
- I found a place, I'll show you.

156
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,110
Thanks to my friend for
telling me about it.

157
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,440
This is in Utah.

158
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,273
- [Jared] Yeah.

159
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:34,070
- So I want to do a maternity shoot here.

160
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,846
But I'm trying to find
a really pretty dress.

161
00:04:36,846 --> 00:04:40,170
But a lot of what I find
is dresses like this.

162
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,003
- [Jared] Right.

163
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:41,940
- Or like this,

164
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,290
and they're not quite
what I'm looking for.

165
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,640
But I also think it would be
really pretty to show my belly.

166
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,926
Like this is kind of fun
for maternity shoots.

167
00:04:50,926 --> 00:04:51,855
'Cause you can see your belly.

168
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:52,950
- 'Cause you can see your actual belly,

169
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,050
and you've never done one
where you show your belly.

170
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,550
- Yeah, so I don't know what to do.

171
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,200
- Well, I know what you could do.

172
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,420
Just like your shirt that
you're wearing right now,

173
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,490
just do that, and just
cut a hole right there,

174
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,100
and that way your belly can show.

175
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,352
And you don't have to
get a new, yeah, perfect!

176
00:05:07,352 --> 00:05:09,800
And then just like have
your belly pop out.

177
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,879
I said ball, have your bally pop out.

178
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:12,712
- Oh that's hilarious.

179
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:13,545
- [Jared] Your bally belly.

180
00:05:13,545 --> 00:05:14,378
- This is cute though too.

181
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:15,770
Just like a really pretty.

182
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,839
- [Jared] Yeah.

183
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,170
- But I just want my arms.

184
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,970
But I would buy this if
it had arms and stuff.

185
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:21,803
- [Jared] Yeah.

186
00:05:21,803 --> 00:05:23,370
- I mean I still might, like
this would be beautiful.

187
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,060
- [Jared] Oh, yeah, sure, great.

188
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,910
- I don't know, I'm thinking.

189
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,760
- [Jared] Think about it.

190
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm gonna just back away
from this conversation.

191
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,700
- Okay.
- I love you.

192
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,533
- [Ellie] Love you!

193
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,586
- [Jared] Bye.

194
00:05:34,586 --> 00:05:36,458
(laughter)

195
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,041
- You see his face?

196
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,848
- [Jared] You winking?

197
00:05:44,848 --> 00:05:46,550
Is he winking at you?

198
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,109
- I looked up and he was like.

199
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,827
And I was like, so I just winked at him.

200
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:52,467
And he was like.

201
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:53,300
His wink.

202
00:05:57,572 --> 00:05:59,905
(laughing)

203
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:01,390
You are so cute.

204
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,440
- [Jared] What are you guys making?

205
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,290
- Um, we're eating
crepes again for dinner.

206
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,123
- [Jared] Yay!

207
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:06,030
- So, sorry!

208
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,020
- [Jared] That sounds crepe!

209
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,340
- That's about as much as I can make.

210
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,670
- Thank you very much, appreciate it.

211
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,935
It's donut time with Jared and Joel.

212
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:13,867
(laughing)

213
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:15,430
Do you know how much I
love hearing that, Jared?

214
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,016
- My brother just older than me is Jared,

215
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:18,020
so it was always Jared and Joel.

216
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,015
The two young ones.

217
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:21,120
- Since you're technically older than me,

218
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,670
should we call it Joel and Jared?

219
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,470
- [Joel] No, I won't
have it any other way.

220
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:26,353
♪ Donut time with Jared and Joel. ♪

221
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:27,186
- [Joel] My favorite time of the day.

222
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,150
- So Joel and I are going to Auto Zone.

223
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,570
Probably soon, because Ellie
and I are actually gonna

224
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,940
go on a trip here pretty soon,

225
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,900
and we're gonna take the trailer with us.

226
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,720
And we're going to install
a trailer break controller.

227
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,553
I am anyway.

228
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:45,735
I don't think, I don't know
that our venture is gonna

229
00:06:45,735 --> 00:06:49,580
be today or not, but the
purchase is going to be today.

230
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,770
The instillation may be another time.

231
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:54,030
But first, we gotta bust
out at least one donut.

232
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,480
You know, I'm not feeling the greatest,

233
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,630
and I think the donuts
would probably help that.

234
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,780
If we can open the box.

235
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,860
- Who do they think I am?

236
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,250
Oh it's open from the
end, not from the side.

237
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,150
I'm really confused here.

238
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,650
- [Jared] How do you open the box?

239
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,650
- I see, I see.

240
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,550
I was thinking it was a small
version of their big ones.

241
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,250
But it's an end open, not a side open.

242
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,350
- That's so weird.

243
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,380
Consistency is key, Krispy Kreme.

244
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,580
- Okay, regular now 'cause
it's going to be warm?

245
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,560
Ooh, it's warm, it's very warm.

246
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,040
- Okay, good, good, good, good, good.

247
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,360
What I don't understand, how
can there be so many calories

248
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,800
in a Krispy Kreme donut
when it's like air?

249
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,340
- All I know is all the calories
disappear once it's gone.

250
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,100
- No one knows where they disappear to.

251
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,420
- The faster we get these eaten,

252
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,940
the quicker they're away from us.

253
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,350
- I'm the worst eater in the world.

254
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,183
It's all over.

255
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:33,210
- Well, that was amazing.

256
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,260
- Still is!

257
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,580
- We may have to stop on the way back.

258
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,480
- We might have to.

259
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,720
Well I hope you enjoyed
the very first installment

260
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,300
of Donut Time with Jared and Joel.

261
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,050
Stay tuned for next week
where we do it again.

262
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,660
- We'll consume more donuts.

263
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,640
- Its kinda the point of the segment.

264
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,530
- Yeah it's really clear.

265
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,363
- Yep.

266
00:07:50,363 --> 00:07:51,196
So we're looking at trailer breaks,

267
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,520
and there's so many different
things you can get with it.

268
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,680
Different adapters for different cars.

269
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,450
We have a Honda, and it's not there.

270
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,090
But this is the one I
was really looking at.

271
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,820
My father-in-law was saying
you should get this exact one.

272
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,720
And it's gone.

273
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,553
Did you take it?

274
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,720
Did you take it?

275
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,553
- Stop.

276
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,570
Get it, brakes.

277
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:12,403
- No, I didn't get it.

278
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:14,300
I'm just kidding; that's
not the one I wanted.

279
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,310
But I noticed it was
gone so its like uhhh.

280
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,300
Someone took that.

281
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,510
Okay, let's see here.

282
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,504
(speaks gibberish)

283
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,587
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

284
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,699
- Okay, the trailer mount is
mounted under the, oh, thanks.

285
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:33,289
(laughs) I am so silly.

286
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,359
Oh this is French.

287
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,193
Oh my gosh!

288
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,299
There we go.

289
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,239
Power knob, manual slide knob.

290
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,700
Digital power display.

291
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,210
I think I might be
getting in over my head.

292
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,100
You think that just because
I hung out with Joel,

293
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,050
you can come over to my house
when the kids are asleep,

294
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,399
and hang out with my wife.

295
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,232
- Yeah.

296
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,370
- [Jared] Yeah, you think?

297
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,010
- I wish we were hanging out.

298
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,010
- Round two of work!

299
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,460
Ellie and Bonnie are
getting together to film

300
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,230
a video all about Bali.

301
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,940
And what's the video today?

302
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,448
- We're going to talk about
how we designed the dress.

303
00:09:04,448 --> 00:09:05,315
- Wait, what are we talking about?

304
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,060
- We're going to talk about
how we designed the dress.

305
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,893
- Oh.

306
00:09:07,893 --> 00:09:09,010
- [Jared] How you designed the dress, fun!

307
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,310
- And then next week is hair curls.

308
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,560
- Oh perfect.

309
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,970
I guess I gotta set everything up for ya,

310
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,790
so I'll see ya in two seconds.

311
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,000
- I have not been feeling the
best pregnancy-wise today,

312
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,870
and Bonnie just dropped a
big ol' fat a bomb on me.

313
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,500
That I am gonna to kick
Jared's butt here in a minute.

314
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,230
After you film for us, honey.

315
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,740
What the heck!

316
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,451
- I was sitting here and I was like,

317
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:33,460
did Jared bring you home
Krispy Kreme donuts,

318
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,161
and Ellie's face was like, what?

319
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,290
- I was like you went
and you didn't bring your

320
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,641
pregnant wife home a Krispy Kreme donut?

321
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:45,720
- First of all, it was Donut
Time with Jared and Joel,

322
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,553
not the spouses.

323
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,640
- Yeah, but he got one
to bring to his wife.

324
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,473
- I'm so--

325
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,320
- Anyway, thanks for
throwing me under the bus.

326
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,153
(laughing)

327
00:09:52,153 --> 00:09:55,680
He got donuts for him,
that's what I was told.

328
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,513
- [Ellie] Okay

329
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,410
- But I did bring you home something.

330
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,243
- You did.

331
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:02,070
He brought home Cheetos,
but they're not Cheetos.

332
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,160
- [Jared] They're cinnamon twists.

333
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,030
- They're cinnamon twists.

334
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,229
- Oh that's yummy.

335
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,001
- [Ellie] It's not a Krispy Kreme donut.

336
00:10:07,001 --> 00:10:09,700
- She was like eww, I don't want it

337
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,940
- Regardless, probably
should not have known that

338
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,754
my husband got a donut today and I didn't.

339
00:10:14,754 --> 00:10:17,390
- [Jared] It was donut
time with Jared and Joel.

340
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,223
- He wants one.

341
00:10:18,223 --> 00:10:20,240
Look at my belly, holy moly.

342
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,890
- I'm sorry that I'm married
to Jack from This is Us.

343
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,880
- Excuse me, excuse me.

344
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,008
I am Jack from This is Us.

345
00:10:29,008 --> 00:10:29,841
You tell her.

346
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:30,674
- We have good husbands.

347
00:10:30,674 --> 00:10:31,507
- Tell her right now.

348
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:32,340
- We have good husbands.
- Tell her right now.

349
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,930
- Jared is really good to me.

350
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,710
Jared and I are just getting ready

351
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,910
to go over the video for the night.

352
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,680
But I wanted to talk to you guys

353
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,560
about this morning, and I
wanted to ask you a question.

354
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,060
I'll ask you the question first.

355
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,850
Every pregnancy I've had,
I have been vlogging.

356
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,300
And I've been filming,
and I truly want to know

357
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,860
what you do, or what you've
done to relax in your pregnancy.

358
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,130
Or something that you've
done for yourself.

359
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,090
I've never done maternity photos,

360
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:03,300
and I wanna plan a one night getaway

361
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,660
when we do the maternity photos.

362
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,910
And me and Jared go do maternity pictures,

363
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,090
and then go stay somewhere,
do like massages together.

364
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,620
That's something that I would like to do,

365
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,250
that we've never done.

366
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,250
And so I've been thinking today.

367
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:19,500
it's kind of crazy that
I've filmed my pregnancies,

368
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,470
and I've filmed my
deliveries, and after birth.

369
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,380
It's just like what
have you done to relax,

370
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,670
or pamper yourself?

371
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:26,650
Or even at home.

372
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:29,090
Like sometimes, for me at home,

373
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,300
just to really enjoy my pregnancy.

374
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,020
I love just laying on my
bed, with my shirt up,

375
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,170
looking at my tummy.

376
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,369
And the kids are watching
shows by me and cuddling me.

377
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:41,160
I just like holding my
tummy, and feeling him move.

378
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,770
Just trying to take a few
minutes out of the day,

379
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:47,040
truly to just like enjoy
my pregnancy, you know?

380
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,440
That was that.

381
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,880
But this morning was a rare thing.

382
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,880
I completely, I was this close
to passing out this morning.

383
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,460
I was taking a shower, I
had just eaten breakfast.

384
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,170
And Jared was just getting
in as I was coming out,

385
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:08,940
and from my toes tingly
all the way to my head,

386
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,690
I literally went, I don't feel good.

387
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,910
And I was like, it's black.

388
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,970
Like I instantly fell into Jared's arms,

389
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,540
and like sat on the tile
floor for a few minutes.

390
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,370
I've never experienced that,

391
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,160
and it was the weirdest,
craziest, and scary thing.

392
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,460
- Yeah, and your face
was white as a ghost.

393
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,970
I literally like put my
arms under your arms,

394
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,580
and just held you.

395
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,860
Like I held you like a baby.

396
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,380
Just like grabbing you like that.

397
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,460
- It was weird.

398
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,270
- And we slowly went down
to the floor together.

399
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,345
- Like what if you
weren't there, you know?

400
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:41,178
- [Jared] Yeah.

401
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,120
- It was so fast.

402
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,550
Maybe the shower was hot.

403
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,650
I was taking a more hot
shower than I normally do.

404
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,120
I don't know, but it was just crazy.

405
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,910
So that's our day today.

406
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,510
I did wanna just ask you guys.

407
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,590
I told them like, all of our
pregnancies we've filmed,

408
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,530
and what do they do to relax?

409
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:00,791
Or what do they do to take
care themselves, you know?

410
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,310
- [Jared] Lush balls

411
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,270
- Baths, baths, I like that.

412
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:07,170
But, thank you guys so much
for watching our video today.

413
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,710
We will see you guys.

414
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,720
- Next time.

415
00:13:09,720 --> 00:00:00,000
- See ya!
- Bye
