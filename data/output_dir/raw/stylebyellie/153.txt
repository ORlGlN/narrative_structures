1
00:00:00,292 --> 00:00:03,459
(gentle guitar music)

2
00:00:04,501 --> 00:00:05,894
(Jackson yelling)

3
00:00:05,894 --> 00:00:06,727
- [Jared] Penny, what good is a pillow

4
00:00:06,727 --> 00:00:09,060
if you don't even lay on it?

5
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,814
- Well after laying in bed all morning

6
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,020
and Jackson's like please, I want to eat,

7
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:18,148
I'm like fine, I'll get up,

8
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,420
I'll make breakfast.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,395
I made some eggs

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,509
and Jackson wanted to eat outside.

11
00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:24,030
I said it's a little cold, I think.

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,893
He goes that's okay.

13
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:28,226
And so he is eating outside.

14
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,019
Is that what you're doing?

15
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:31,852
- Yeah.

16
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:33,671
- [Ellie] And you can
see my pan the other day,

17
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:35,376
I totally smoked the house out,

18
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:38,315
so I threw it out here to cool off.

19
00:00:38,315 --> 00:00:42,482
Why are you cute to want
to eat out there Spiderman?

20
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:45,142
Okay do you want me to close the door

21
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:46,156
or do you want to come in?

22
00:00:46,156 --> 00:00:47,075
You want to come in now?

23
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:48,038
- Yeah.

24
00:00:48,038 --> 00:00:50,096
(Ellie laughs)

25
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:50,929
- Bye.

26
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,291
- [Jared] Hi, you're on
the phone with someone?

27
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,242
Who are you talking to?

28
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:57,443
Oh the graham cracker.

29
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,233
What did the graham cracker have to say?

30
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,307
- Says it's talk.

31
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:01,492
- [Jared] Are you talking?

32
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:02,900
It's ringing, answer it.

33
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,044
He's gotta update his app first.

34
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:04,876
- Hey!

35
00:01:04,876 --> 00:01:06,248
- [Jared] Hey that's his
phone, where's your phone?

36
00:01:06,248 --> 00:01:08,730
He's gotta update his apps
first, before he can use it okay?

37
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,563
- Hey!

38
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:10,819
- [Jared] The new operating
system just came out.

39
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:12,983
He's gotta update, so he
has the latest firmware.

40
00:01:12,983 --> 00:01:15,153
- Where's the letter E?

41
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:15,986
E!

42
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,725
- Like what kid uses a graham cracker

43
00:01:20,725 --> 00:01:22,414
as a cell phone.

44
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:24,623
That is the time that
we're living in right now,

45
00:01:24,623 --> 00:01:26,199
where phones are this thin

46
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,789
and they look like candy bars

47
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:29,445
and graham crackers.

48
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:30,278
What's the deal guys?

49
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:31,111
We get home from church

50
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,327
and the first thing you can do is just

51
00:01:32,327 --> 00:01:33,160
take off your clothes

52
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,893
and you're in your diaper and undies?

53
00:01:34,893 --> 00:01:37,141
What's the deal, huh?

54
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:38,891
Huh, what's the deal?

55
00:01:40,637 --> 00:01:41,470
What's he?

56
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,819
He gave this knife and
just patted me on the leg

57
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:45,706
and was like, here you go Dad.

58
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,419
Hey are you comfy now?

59
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:48,399
Are you comfy now?
- Yeah.

60
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,496
- [Jared] Close your eyes, go to sleep.

61
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:52,746
(laughing)

62
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,313
(Jackson yelling)

63
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:03,264
- That's his reaction from
when Mom and Dad just kissed.

64
00:02:03,264 --> 00:02:04,264
Where is he?

65
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:08,918
- Hey Jackson, I want to kiss her.

66
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:10,984
- Jared just kissed me and Jackson went

67
00:02:10,984 --> 00:02:13,888
(yelling)

68
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,955
(yelling)

69
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,862
Wait wait Jackson wait
stop stop stop stop,

70
00:02:16,862 --> 00:02:19,362
wait wait, hold on one second.

71
00:02:20,927 --> 00:02:22,337
(yelling)

72
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,553
(laughing)

73
00:02:24,553 --> 00:02:26,517
- You're a goofball.

74
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:28,684
(yelling)

75
00:02:30,488 --> 00:02:31,321
- Hey Jackson.

76
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:33,488
(yelling)

77
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,073
Follow me this way here real quick.

78
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:41,058
Let's take a closer look.

79
00:02:41,058 --> 00:02:43,866
Oh, some more evidence here.

80
00:02:43,866 --> 00:02:45,522
Ah-ha.

81
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:47,022
Excuse me, Calvin,

82
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,601
- [Ellie] Go tell Dad what you did.

83
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,476
- Come over here young man.

84
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:53,143
Calvin Scott Mecham,

85
00:02:55,038 --> 00:02:57,150
I need you to come over with me please.

86
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,400
Calvin come on!

87
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,193
Excuse me young man,

88
00:03:03,193 --> 00:03:06,776
do you know anything
about this right here?

89
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,233
Is that yours?

90
00:03:10,187 --> 00:03:11,185
- It's mine.

91
00:03:11,185 --> 00:03:15,072
- [Jared] Well where's the rest of it?

92
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,905
- Gone.

93
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:16,774
- [Jared] It's gone?

94
00:03:16,774 --> 00:03:17,892
- Yeah.

95
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:20,059
- [Jared] Where did it go?

96
00:03:23,956 --> 00:03:24,789
- Show.

97
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,598
- [Jared] Where'd it go, you're
gonna show me where it went?

98
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:27,431
- Yeah.

99
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:31,024
- [Jared] Okay let's see, show me the way.

100
00:03:31,024 --> 00:03:33,274
(laughing)

101
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,380
- No.

102
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,400
- No not here okay.

103
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,101
- [Ellie] Did he look in the toilet?

104
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,594
- [Jared] Well he went
in there and said no.

105
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,677
Where did it go, show me.

106
00:03:50,873 --> 00:03:52,873
No, not down the stairs.

107
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:55,106
- No.

108
00:03:55,106 --> 00:03:59,073
- This is the great chocolate detective.

109
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,636
Show me where it went.

110
00:04:01,636 --> 00:04:02,469
- No.

111
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:03,302
- [Jared] No?

112
00:04:03,302 --> 00:04:04,635
Where did it go?

113
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,334
(laughing)

114
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:09,820
- No.

115
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,282
(laughing)

116
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:13,115
No.

117
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:14,281
- [Jared] No?

118
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,613
Okay, is it in your tummy?

119
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:17,446
- Yeah.

120
00:04:17,447 --> 00:04:19,918
- Yes, it's in your tummy.

121
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:20,750
It's in your tummy?

122
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,583
- Yes.

123
00:04:21,584 --> 00:04:22,745
- [Jared] You took me
on this wild goose chase

124
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:25,010
and it's in your tummy this whole time?

125
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,581
(laughing)

126
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:29,246
- Dad, he took one and
it was in his tummy.

127
00:04:29,246 --> 00:04:31,361
- Yeah, oh my goodness.

128
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:33,163
Okay well here's the deal,

129
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:34,821
you are your mother's
son, that's for sure,

130
00:04:34,821 --> 00:04:36,341
that's point number one.

131
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:38,064
Yeah, I'm looking at you.

132
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:38,956
- He's silly.

133
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,854
- Point number two,

134
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,758
you can't just leave garbage
lying around the house.

135
00:04:42,758 --> 00:04:44,835
Let's go throw it in the garbage, okay?

136
00:04:44,835 --> 00:04:45,668
No?

137
00:04:45,668 --> 00:04:47,974
- You know what, that made my
dad always always the maddest,

138
00:04:47,974 --> 00:04:50,758
he'd be like I don't care that you ate

139
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,973
the last licorice,

140
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:52,918
I don't care that you ate it,

141
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,101
don't leave the empty bag in the pantry,

142
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,331
because then that makes me mad

143
00:04:56,331 --> 00:04:57,355
when I go to eat the licorice

144
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,066
and there's none there.
- There's nothing there.

145
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,985
- That's the worse thing.

146
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:01,520
But guess what,

147
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,112
I'm guilty of that more than anyone else.

148
00:05:03,112 --> 00:05:04,714
in the world.
- Oh yeah.

149
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,662
- Calvin, that was hilarious.

150
00:05:06,662 --> 00:05:08,276
- You guys have seen on our vlogs

151
00:05:08,276 --> 00:05:10,080
and on Ellie's Instagram Stories

152
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,941
that we love Hello Fresh.

153
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,386
It is dinner time, so we
are making Hello Fresh.

154
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:16,484
But what you guys probably don't see

155
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:19,031
is all of the times outside of the vlog

156
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:21,272
that we're actually using
and making Hello Fresh,

157
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:22,826
because we love it.

158
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:25,898
It's easy, its quick and it's delicious.

159
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:28,010
Hello Fresh is a meal kit delivery service

160
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,474
that delivers food to your door for free

161
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:32,055
in a recyclable, insulated box

162
00:05:32,055 --> 00:05:35,472
and all of the food is pre-measured, cut,

163
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,000
whatever you need to
make it fast and easy.

164
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,170
Today we are making
Carolina Barbecue Chicken

165
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,827
and I've just gotta smash
this chicken down to size.

166
00:05:44,827 --> 00:05:46,529
(pounding)

167
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:47,789
(sizzling)

168
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:50,626
(chill twangy music)

169
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:51,498
While we're watching this sizzle,

170
00:05:51,498 --> 00:05:53,055
it smells so good already,

171
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:54,632
every week, Hello Fresh comes out

172
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:56,168
with new recipes and they come

173
00:05:56,168 --> 00:05:58,055
with step by step instructions.

174
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,559
And each meal takes
like 30 minutes to cook.

175
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,111
This one says it takes about 20 minutes.

176
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:05,413
Each meal comes out to less than 10 bucks,

177
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:06,792
so it's a great deal for great food.

178
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:08,027
- So while Jared is
finishing making up dinner,

179
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:09,305
I wanted to tell you guys

180
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:12,305
that we only have three meals shipped

181
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:13,571
to us a week.

182
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,121
You can definitely have more,

183
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:17,552
but we have felt that for our family

184
00:06:17,552 --> 00:06:20,081
that that's perfect,
because if there's a day

185
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:22,353
we want to go out to
dinner, we can do that,

186
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:24,640
and that also gives me the opportunity

187
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,848
to still cook some meals that I want,

188
00:06:26,848 --> 00:06:30,986
but I'm not so overwhelmed
with cooking every night.

189
00:06:30,986 --> 00:06:33,690
The meals that we've made
that I've absolutely loved,

190
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,498
I've written down, and then I go out

191
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:38,075
and by those on my own and make those,

192
00:06:38,075 --> 00:06:40,200
in addition to the meals that we get

193
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,049
for the new week.

194
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:42,595
So I have Beef Ragu Spaghetti

195
00:06:42,595 --> 00:06:44,896
that I have written down
that I really liked.

196
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:48,908
And the Southwest Stuffed
Peppers are awesome.

197
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,049
You can see Calvin drew all over it.

198
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,921
But those peppers are my favorite

199
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:54,612
and I instagramed those the other day,

200
00:06:54,612 --> 00:06:56,217
or I tweeted that the other day.

201
00:06:56,217 --> 00:06:57,994
It was by far my favorite

202
00:06:57,994 --> 00:07:00,066
and then I made it for my
sisters the other night.

203
00:07:00,066 --> 00:07:01,162
And then today for lunch,

204
00:07:01,162 --> 00:07:04,121
I actually made the Chicken
Pineapple Quesadilla.

205
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:07,895
So good, like all the meals are hearty,

206
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:08,728
they're yummy.

207
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,864
I cook a lot more in the kitchen,

208
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:13,255
but it's just been a nice break for me,

209
00:07:13,255 --> 00:07:15,831
so I don't have to prepare dinner

210
00:07:15,831 --> 00:07:18,697
and lunch every single day all the time.

211
00:07:18,697 --> 00:07:22,324
It really has eliminated a lot of work

212
00:07:22,324 --> 00:07:24,924
on my shoulders, so I'm glad.

213
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,988
We've been doing this for how many months?

214
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:27,980
- Nine months?

215
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,524
- Yeah, so the first time we did work

216
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:32,740
with Hello Fresh, we really liked it,

217
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,147
and then we worked with them another time

218
00:07:34,147 --> 00:07:36,308
and then Jared started just having it come

219
00:07:36,308 --> 00:07:38,281
every week, just because we really

220
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:40,593
just fell in love with it, so.

221
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,449
This would be awesome for
the holidays coming up,

222
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:44,385
sometimes you really
don't know what you get

223
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:47,181
your parents that have
pretty much everything

224
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:49,000
that they want or need

225
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,391
and this is something
that I'm writing down,

226
00:07:52,391 --> 00:07:54,397
shhh, I don't want my parents to watch.

227
00:07:54,397 --> 00:07:56,993
Something that I want to get family,

228
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,690
because it's helpful.

229
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,675
- [Jared] So this is what
the final plate looks like.

230
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,297
I'm so happy with myself.

231
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:03,811
I think it looks so delicious.

232
00:08:03,811 --> 00:08:05,110

- Full service Hello Fresh.

244
00:08:29,489 --> 00:08:30,322
Goodnight.

245
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:33,088
Goodnight buddy.

246
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,220
Hi sweet girl, did you
have a good potty break.

247
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,053
Yeah?

248
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:41,100
You're such a good girl.

249
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,303
Penny, what good is a pillow
if you don't even lay on it?

250
00:08:45,303 --> 00:08:49,414
There you go, yeah, get
in your place, come on.

251
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:50,829
It's the funniest thing,

252
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:53,931
lay on the pillow Sillypants McGee.

253
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,515
That is not comfortable.

254
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:56,593
That is much more comfortable.

255
00:08:56,593 --> 00:08:58,893
In church, you know I teach primary,

256
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:02,556
so I teach the eight
and nine year old kids

257
00:09:02,556 --> 00:09:06,914
and in the big class where
all the classes get together,

258
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,472
we sing primary songs,

259
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:09,979
and one of the songs we were singing about

260
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,505
is families, it's about families

261
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:14,760
and families can be together forever.

262
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,878
The first words are like I
have a family here on earth,

263
00:09:16,878 --> 00:09:19,181
they are so good to me,

264
00:09:19,181 --> 00:09:22,141
and while we were singing that song,

265
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:26,173
I just got punched in
the gut, in the heart

266
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:29,840
and I just thought of
something for a second

267
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:32,780
and I just

268
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,363
(gentle music)

269
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:40,471
We have been trying to have

270
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,304
- [Ellie] Yeah.

271
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:44,860
- a baby and it has been difficult for us.

272
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,056
We've gone through two
miscarriages recently

273
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:52,768
and I just have been thinking
about our future family.

274
00:09:52,768 --> 00:09:55,601
And I got hit with the realization

275
00:09:59,594 --> 00:10:03,011
that we may only have two kids of our own

276
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,475
and that's not a bad thing.

277
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:10,142
This may be our family right now

278
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:13,029
and I'm so grateful for them.

279
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,175
I'm not sure what the
future has in store for us,

280
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:20,989
but I just got hit with the fact that

281
00:10:20,989 --> 00:10:25,156
this might be it and that's
not a bad thing at all,

282
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:29,824
but it was hard for me to hear that voice

283
00:10:29,824 --> 00:10:33,324
say that to me, because of what we've gone

284
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:36,139
through and everything

285
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,139
and I'm not trying to set
any standards or plans

286
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,543
or anything like that,

287
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,968
but it just came into my head,

288
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,086
- [Ellie] You need to always
be grateful for what you have.

289
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:47,540
- Yeah exactly, I want to
be grateful for what I have,

290
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,178
but I also want to be prepared

291
00:10:49,178 --> 00:10:53,885
for the events that may or
may not happen in the future.

292
00:10:53,885 --> 00:10:56,990
Whether or not that is true,

293
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,238
if we do or don't have more kids,

294
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,571
it just hit me that that's a possibility

295
00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:06,389
that Jackson and Calvin may be it.

296
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:09,639
And I feel like I have to preface that,

297
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,509
I am grateful for our kids,

298
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,676
but it's just hard to have
that come to my realization.

299
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,637
Do you know what I mean by that?

300
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:25,470
That's what I wanted to
tell you a little bit.

301
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,260
It's not too often that I just get hit

302
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,094
with these moments, these
sudden clarity things,

303
00:11:37,094 --> 00:11:39,804
and I never wanted to come across

304
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,325
that I'm not grateful for what I have,

305
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,684
because the amount of gratitude

306
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:45,017
that I have is unimaginable.

307
00:11:46,423 --> 00:11:49,441
And it was just weird for
me to have that feeling

308
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,777
and to have it so close to me right now

309
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:55,287
and I feel like that's
the feeling that I wanted

310
00:11:55,287 --> 00:11:56,954
to have come across,

311
00:11:58,144 --> 00:12:02,128
and I don't know what's going to happen,

312
00:12:02,128 --> 00:12:05,616
but I want to be prepared
for any situation

313
00:12:05,616 --> 00:12:06,449
that may come.

314
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:10,209
You may have heard that this
video is filmed on Sunday

315
00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:11,926
but it's uploaded later.

316
00:12:11,926 --> 00:12:14,812
We're currently a day
ahead of schedule right now

317
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,517
and that's on purpose.

318
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:19,093
After Halloween, Ellie and I
are going to be out of town

319
00:12:19,093 --> 00:12:21,141
and we're not going to be able to upload

320
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,543
while we are out of town,

321
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,357
so we have some videos that we're filming

322
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:26,758
in the meantime to go up while we're gone

323
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,540
and we'll resume normal schedule

324
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,183
as soon as we get back.

325
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,912
I wanted to let you
guys know ahead of time,

326
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,784
so you're not shocked when it does happen,

327
00:12:33,784 --> 00:12:35,449
but it's gonna be a lot of fun.

328
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:36,999
I'm excited for you to see the videos

329
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:38,069
that we have planned,

330
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:40,565
but for now, we're gonna end the vlog.

331
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:41,741
Thank you so much for watching.

332
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,492
I hope you had a wonderful evening

333
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:45,893
and we will see you next time.

334
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:46,934
Bye.

335
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:47,943
Go get Mama.

336
00:12:47,943 --> 00:12:49,259
Go get Mom, go get Mom.

337
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,142
- [Ellie] Penny (growls).

338
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,801
- Go get Mom, go get Mom.
- Penny.

339
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,218
- Hey that's my towel.

340
00:12:55,218 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jared] She wants to wash her face too.
