1
00:00:00,132 --> 00:00:00,965
- Baby--

2
00:00:02,057 --> 00:00:02,890
- Brother.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,846
- Baby brooother.

4
00:00:06,846 --> 00:00:07,679
(laughs)

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,837
- Mm-mm-mm.

6
00:00:08,837 --> 00:00:10,327
(Ellie laughs)

7
00:00:10,327 --> 00:00:11,400
- [Ellie] Let's go!

8
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,873
- Are you stopping in the mirror

9
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:13,706
and being like, oh wow.

10
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:14,539
- Move it!

11
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:15,660
- [Jared] That's his eyeballs right there

12
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,059
and that's his little nose.

13
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:18,374
- [Woman] That's his eye
socket and his little--

14
00:00:18,374 --> 00:00:19,207
- [Jared] Yeah.

15
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:20,570
- Are we gonna see baby brother today?

16
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,837
- No babies here.

17
00:00:21,837 --> 00:00:23,383
- Is he gonna come out?

18
00:00:23,383 --> 00:00:24,216
- He's not gonna come out,

19
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:25,726
but we're gonna go to--

20
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,180
- [Jared] We're gonna go look at pictures.

21
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,010
- And we're gonna see
him in my belly moving.

22
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,843
- Mmm-hmm.

23
00:00:30,843 --> 00:00:34,010
So we've actually got a few
doctor's appointments today.

24
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,200
- Today's doctor appointment day.

25
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,033
- [Jared] Yes it is.

26
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:38,449
- It's cut pre-cancerous
out of your back day.

27
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:39,282
- [Jared] Yes.

28
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:40,900
- It's scrub your teeth day.

29
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,733
- [Jared] Yes.

30
00:00:41,733 --> 00:00:43,480
- And it's check on baby boy day.

31
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,960
- Yeah, so Ellie is going to the doctor

32
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,960
to cut out more of the melanoma stage mole

33
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,480
and I don't envy you one bit.

34
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,165
I hope they don't cut out too much--

35
00:00:56,165 --> 00:00:58,460
When I got mine cut out here,

36
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,921
recovery was annoying
- Oh yeah.

37
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:02,531
and now they're gonna
dig deeper on your back.

38
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,620
- Yeah, it's weird because as it heals,

39
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,340
it itches like crazy.

40
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:08,470
I guess it could be like any
other scab, I don't know.

41
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,800
But it's so deep, it hurts.
- Well it's deep, yeah.

42
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,350
- My mom's like, are they gonna have

43
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,270
to do a stitch in your back?

44
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,103
- [Jared] I don't know.

45
00:01:16,103 --> 00:01:18,863
- We'll see, but it's crazy.
- We'll have to see.

46
00:01:18,863 --> 00:01:19,696
(mock retching)

47
00:01:19,696 --> 00:01:20,850
- [Jared] Okay, Calvin can you show us

48
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,160
your super cat speed?

49
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,820
- [Ellie] Say it and run.

50
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,800
- [Jared] Oh you gotta say it.

51
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,970
You gotta say it to work.

52
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,640
- Guys he's so shy.

53
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,660
- [Jared] I know.

54
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,660
- He came in our room this morning

55
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,780
and goes super cat speed

56
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,480
and then ran out.
- And then ran out.

57
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,688
(Jared laughs)

58
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:37,521
- Gah.

59
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:38,460
He doesn't like--

60
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,351
He knows when we're filming.

61
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,184
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

62
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,100
- So we've got a busy day today.

63
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,650
Mom's at the doctor's right now

64
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,260
and I want to tell you when Mom gets home

65
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,650
her back is probably
gonna hurt pretty bad.

66
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,110
So we need to be extra extra
nice to Mom today, okay?

67
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,280
- Okay.

68
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,990
- And then we're all
gonna go to the dentist

69
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,930
and the dentist (chomp),
they're gonna clean our teeth.

70
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,170
The dentist is gonna clean
Mommy's and Daddy's teeth

71
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,540
and make sure they're extra nice

72
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,481
and strong and clean.

73
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,440
And then, after that, we're gonna go

74
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,722
to the doctor and we're gonna
see our little baby brother.

75
00:02:05,722 --> 00:02:07,472
Baby--

76
00:02:07,472 --> 00:02:08,305
- Brother.

77
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,390
- Baby brooother.

78
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,864
(laughing)

79
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:16,447
(bright music)

80
00:02:20,563 --> 00:02:22,474
(clapping)

81
00:02:22,474 --> 00:02:25,307
(Calvin laughing)

82
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,707
- Your guy's face is dry, so I have to--

83
00:02:28,707 --> 00:02:31,150
oh don't put it in your hair Cal ah!

84
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,420
Mommy and Daddy are going to the dentist,

85
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,660
and you guys can maybe watch a show

86
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,680
while we're at the dentist office.

87
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,780
Is that okay guys?

88
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,730
Can you be good?

89
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,700
- Give us a thumbs up.

90
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,533
Yeah.

91
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,130
- Oh you're so warm, wow.

92
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,600
Okay we are rushing from
appointment to appointment today,

93
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,660
until we're all done with appointments.

94
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,410
I got stitches in my back.

95
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,243
- Mm-mm-mm.

96
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:56,471
(Ellie laughs)

97
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:57,480
- Let's go!

98
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,313
- Are you stopping in the mirror

99
00:02:58,313 --> 00:02:59,643
and being like oh wow.

100
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,476
- Move it!

101
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:03,270
Jackson, where does he get that?

102
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,160
I promise we do not look in the mirror

103
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,370
and do crap like that.

104
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,570
- I promise you don't look

105
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,640
in the mirror and do that.

106
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,850
- I got an inch cut out of my back,

107
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,900
I have a few stitches in there

108
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,650
and he said to be really
careful the next few days,

109
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:18,100
so I don't upset it or open it up.

110
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,410
He's like just and take it easy.

111
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,550
And I go back in a month
to do my ingrown toenails.

112
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,660
So this is the year of taking care

113
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,080
of our bodies, our mental
health and our babies.

114
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,070
- Hey Ellie, are you
watching anything on TV?

115
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,729
- [Ellie] No!

116
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:33,592
I'm closing my eyes.

117
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,100
- You're closing your eyes?

118
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,450
We're at the dentist office right now,

119
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,710
and Ellie's next door.

120
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,130
The kids are playing in the front area

121
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,230
with the receptionist.

122
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,840
I changed my mind.

123
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,920
I'm gonna watch something on the TV.

124
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,640
When I was a kid, this was all you wanted.

125
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,955
And it never was a thing.

126
00:03:49,955 --> 00:03:51,297
- [Woman] You had to count
holes in the ceiling.

127
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:52,990
- Yeah exactly, you just looked at

128
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,410
all the marks on the ceiling.

129
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,785
Uh-oh,

130
00:03:55,785 --> 00:03:56,618
- [Woman] How many light bulbs are there?

131
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:58,990
- [Jared] please wait and
try again, maybe I won't.

132
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,130
- When scheduling appointments,

133
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,480
you always schedule them
not so close together

134
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,990
and that's exactly what I did today,

135
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,580
but it just seems like
one after the other,

136
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,630
it's like get in the car, run.

137
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,750
Our teeth are clean and sparkly.

138
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,700
But you know what?

139
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,533
Smile.

140
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,150
But you know what?

141
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,550
- It was the most embarrassing
dentist appointment

142
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,900
I've ever had in my life.

143
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
- We both need to go back

144
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,014
and we both need some dental work.

145
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,850
- I've had fillings done before,

146
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,200
I've had fillings, but
I've never had it be like

147
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,855
okay, you need to get
three cavities filled,

148
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:31,850
like you need three cavities--

149
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:32,714
- [Ellie] Four.

150
00:04:32,714 --> 00:04:33,633
- Four, was it four?

151
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:35,571
Ahhhh.

152
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:38,870
- He's like they're so small,
he's like I just would rather

153
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,440
get them taken care of,

154
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,060
before they evolve to something bigger,

155
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,090
and it's like I have never
had that happen before.,

156
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,520
What the heck?

157
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,470
They said our teeth
look really good, but--

158
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,300
and you know what?
- Obviously not.

159
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,240
- I scheduled my next
dentist appointment though

160
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,420
for six months, for my cleaning

161
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,410
and we will have a

162
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,090
just a few week old baby,
- A one month old?

163
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,770
- Not even, a few week old baby.

164
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,500
Maybe it'll be a month.
- Oh my goodness.

165
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,400
We'll have a month old baby

166
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,080
and I was thinking in my head

167
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,060
of feeding, because I
scheduled Jared and I,

168
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,710
I was like okay, how do we do this

169
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,290
with a newborn again?

170
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,338
Let me do this time,

171
00:05:16,338 --> 00:05:18,850
I was thinking of all the stuff, so.

172
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:19,820
- [Jared] You haven't thought about that.

173
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,000
- Yeah, crazy, I was like oh wow,

174
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm gonna have a newborn,

175
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,190
we're gonna have a newborn.

176
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,440
- You know what I am proud of though?

177
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,273
- What?

178
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:27,960
- I haven't missed a day of flossing

179
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,415
since our last dentist appointment.

180
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:31,248
- What?

181
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,766
- And I still have those frickin cavities.

182
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,933
(gentle guitar music)

183
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,940
Now look, up on that TV,

184
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,407
that's where we're gonna see brother.

185
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:51,552
So let's look and we'll see
if we can see brother, okay?

186
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:53,380
- [Jackson] There's his body.

187
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:56,018
- [Jared] Oh he's doing hand
stands like you guys do.

188
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,880
- [Calvin] Hi.

189
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,713
- [Ellie] Jackson, do you see his butt?

190
00:05:58,713 --> 00:06:01,010
- [Jared] Oh my goodness,
do you see his leg and foot?

191
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,190
There's his leg.

192
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,730
- [Jackson] Can you see the baby?

193
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:04,782
- [Jackson] I saw the foot.

194
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:06,311
There's the baby's eyes.

195
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,144
(Jared laughing)

196
00:06:07,144 --> 00:06:09,210
- [Jared] It kinda looks like it.

197
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,470
Those look like two round objects.

198
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,970
- [Ellie] Those are his feet.

199
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,803
- [Jared] Yeah.

200
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:16,136
(heartbeat)

201
00:06:17,223 --> 00:06:20,920
(gentle guitar music)

202
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,710
See that right there?

203
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,560
That's his spine, that's his spine,

204
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,120
that's right here on you.

205
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,600
And right here on you.

206
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,380
Yeah, hey here's confirmation.

207
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,368
There it is.

208
00:06:32,368 --> 00:06:33,613
(Jared laughs)

209
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:34,446
Yep.

210
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:35,279
- [Ellie] It's a baby boy.

211
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:36,470
- [Jared] That's a baby boy.

212
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,183
Do you see the baby's arm?

213
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:40,112
- [Jackson] Is that the smile?

214
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:43,621
- [Jared] Is that the smile?

215
00:06:43,621 --> 00:06:47,560
(gentle guitar music)

216
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,020
That's his eyeballs right there

217
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,500
and that's his little nose.

218
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,620
Do you see that guys?

219
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,453
Do you see his head?

220
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,750
- [Ellie] Aww, that's so cute.

221
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,210
I've never seen that.

222
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,520
- Drinking the amniotic
fluid, that's so cool.

223
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,340
It's time for a celebration.

224
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,590
Not only did we see our camera shy baby

225
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,750
today at the ultrasound, oh my goodness.

226
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,290
I don't know if it was a
Braxton-Hicks contraction or what?

227
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,920
- She said I was having a
Braxton-Hicks contractions,

228
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,195
that wasn't helping the case.

229
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,862
- [Jared] And he's so low.

230
00:07:17,862 --> 00:07:21,718
- And his head is right here.

231
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:22,551
(Jared laughs)

232
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,100
She's like, I can't.

233
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,810
She's like your bone's in the way.

234
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,967
I'm like--
- Uuuh.

235
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,450
- Baby's head is right here,

236
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,300
but his bum bum's here.

237
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,190
- [Jared] Yep.

238
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,023
- Great.

239
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:32,856
- [Ellie] Yeah, you saw him.

240
00:07:32,856 --> 00:07:34,520
- Yeah, so we saw baby brother.

241
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,450
And Calvin just went pee in the potty

242
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,810
it's time to celebrate.

243
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,990
And we're celebrating
by having a bath bomb

244
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:41,350
in the bath today.

245
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:42,440
Do you hear that buddy?

246
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,800
You're getting a bath bomb.

247
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
And I'm getting the spotlight,

248
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,980
right where I belong.

249
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,010
In the spotlight, ahhhh.

250
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:52,640
Boogedeegoogedeeboo!

251
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,290
Let me just say and I gotta say it, Ellie,

252
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:58,809
The Flash is getting pretty good, okay?

253
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,150
We were a little hesitant at first,

254
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,202
there's some goofy stuff
and that's the whole thing--

255
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:05,469
- There's some stupid episodes.

256
00:08:05,469 --> 00:08:06,757
(Jared laughs)

257
00:08:06,757 --> 00:08:10,440
- The thing is, there's
some really cheesy stuff,

258
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,590
but this whole seasons,

259
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:13,883
the whole Devoe.
- Oh my gosh.

260
00:08:13,883 --> 00:08:14,716
- So good.

261
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:17,710
- So much better than a speedster villain.

262
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,680
- Kid Flash?

263
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,630
- Listen, we like The Flash a lot.

264
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,740
- We love it, but I hate it.

265
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:27,850
- It's a love hate relationship.

266
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,220
- It's good though right now,

267
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,230
so it's a thumbs up.

268
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,710
- Yeah definitely a thumbs up from us.

269
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,120
The kids are in bed.

270
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,830
We are having a Flash marathon.

271
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,330
And that's where we're gonna
end the night, I'm sorry.

272
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,309
No, sorry, not sorry.

273
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:44,019
We're ending the night with The Flash.

274
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,280
Thank you Barry Allen for saving the day.

275
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,560
And we will see you guys tomorrow

276
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,050
on the next episode of Barry Allen,

277
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:52,991
the fastest man alive.

278
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:55,579
- I'm Barry Allen and I'm
the fastest man alive.

279
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,370
- Thanks for watching guys

280
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,340
and we will see you tomorrow.

281
00:08:58,340 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
