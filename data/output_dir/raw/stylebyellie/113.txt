1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:01,072
- I know what it's like
(bright music)

2
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:02,662
to be grateful to have a baby.

3
00:00:02,662 --> 00:00:04,054
- We're getting our haircuts together,

4
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:04,977
you excited bud?

5
00:00:04,977 --> 00:00:05,810
- Yeah.

6
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:06,643
- [Jared] When you hang out with Dad,

7
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:08,192
you get to do some fun stuff, huh?

8
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,025
- Yeah!

9
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:09,858
- Yeah.

10
00:00:09,858 --> 00:00:13,617
I have to ask Ellie if
Bonnie can go with me.

11
00:00:13,617 --> 00:00:15,593
(laughing)

12
00:00:15,593 --> 00:00:17,106
I am crossing my fingers.

13
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:19,354
- I bet there's a thousand people in line.

14
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:20,187
(cheering and clapping)

15
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,437
- [Jared] Yeah!

16
00:00:24,378 --> 00:00:25,780
- Good morning.

17
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,234
(laughs)

18
00:00:27,234 --> 00:00:29,256
Look at me today.

19
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:31,006
Hi Cal, good morning.

20
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,623
Guess what we're doing today?

21
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,391
I think Calvin's been ready

22
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:37,254
to be potty trained for awhile,

23
00:00:37,254 --> 00:00:40,005
and I'm going to give it this weekend

24
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:43,124
to work with him on potty training

25
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:45,126
and see how he adapts to it.

26
00:00:45,126 --> 00:00:46,958
He's really good to sit on the toilet

27
00:00:46,958 --> 00:00:50,392
and I think the warming up
process is so good for kids.

28
00:00:50,392 --> 00:00:52,984
It took awhile to warm
Jackson up to the toilet

29
00:00:52,984 --> 00:00:54,158
when we were potty training him.

30
00:00:54,158 --> 00:00:55,964
Calvin, it's worked so fast.

31
00:00:55,964 --> 00:00:57,763
I think it's because he sees his brother,

32
00:00:57,763 --> 00:00:58,940
and so he's more willing.

33
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,387
So we have underwear on him.

34
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,996
So we're gonna try this
weekend to see how things go.

35
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:04,596
And Jared just called me.

36
00:01:04,596 --> 00:01:07,263
And Jared doesn't get flustered,

37
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,052
I guess much, with YouTube,

38
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:11,459
and we've talked about this a lot,

39
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:12,979
but just to reiterate,

40
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,146
it's sometimes hard for me

41
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:19,990
and Jared to film our
daily what's going on,

42
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,643
because sometimes, and
it's not even a lot,

43
00:01:24,643 --> 00:01:26,890
sometimes it's just a few people

44
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,140
will take that and spin it.

45
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,882
And I'm pregnant, I'm sick, I love it,

46
00:01:33,882 --> 00:01:36,531
and I always always end it with,

47
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,163
I'm grateful, I love it.

48
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:40,499
I know what it's taken me to get a baby.

49
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,416
I laid on that damn bathroom floor,

50
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:47,452
for eight hours, cramping, crying,

51
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:50,014
bleeding trying to miscarry.

52
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:53,422
I know what it's like to
be grateful to have a baby.

53
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:56,896
And so when we film about, I'm sick,

54
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:57,958
this is what happened,

55
00:01:57,958 --> 00:02:00,094
I'm just trying to give you guys a vlog,

56
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:01,974
and I'm just trying to
show you what's going on

57
00:02:01,974 --> 00:02:05,625
in a 10 week pregnant body, you know?

58
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,729
So I'm not complaining.

59
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,291
I have never once
complained about pregnancy.

60
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:13,168
I prayed to God that
if I could get pregnant

61
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:16,179
with Jackson, I will never complain.

62
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,888
And I definitely have told God it hurts,

63
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:19,936
it hurts to be pregnant.

64
00:02:19,936 --> 00:02:21,754
It hurts when you sneeze,
and like you feel like

65
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:23,106
your stomach rips open.

66
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:24,898
But that's not complaining,

67
00:02:24,898 --> 00:02:27,674
that's explaining what
it's like to be pregnant.

68
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:31,406
I have been grateful for every
second of my kids' childhood

69
00:02:31,406 --> 00:02:35,573
and I truly believe that I
have soaken up every second.

70
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,566
I am a mom and I am a mother

71
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:44,599
and that is the only thing
in my life that matters,

72
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,766
being a mom, and paired with
that is being a wife to Jared.

73
00:02:49,743 --> 00:02:52,008
But that is something that I've wanted

74
00:02:52,008 --> 00:02:53,751
for a long time, and it's something

75
00:02:53,751 --> 00:02:54,671
that I don't take lightly

76
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,526
or that I don't take for granted.

77
00:02:56,526 --> 00:02:58,993
So I definitely have to say that,

78
00:02:58,993 --> 00:02:59,941
(laughs)

79
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:02,105
then I'll move on with
the rest of my pregnancy.

80
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:04,950
But by me talking about symptoms,

81
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,046
by me talking about situations,

82
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:11,390
by me being frustrated that Calvin

83
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,134
is ripping the toilet paper to shreds

84
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:15,679
in the bathroom, that's just motherhood.

85
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:18,382
And it sucks, it sucks that he ripped up

86
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:19,374
a whole toilet paper roll,

87
00:03:19,374 --> 00:03:21,790
but I'm just showing you it sucks,

88
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,946
that doesn't mean I'm
not grateful for him,

89
00:03:22,946 --> 00:03:25,881
it doesn't mean I'm not
grateful for pregnancy,

90
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:26,714
I'm just explaining,

91
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:28,128
that's what a vlog is for.

92
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,864
That's the purpose of our vlog,

93
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:31,324
is just to show you what the heck

94
00:03:31,324 --> 00:03:32,828
is going on in our world.

95
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:35,540
And it's weird that some
people want to watch it,

96
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,239
it's weird that I want to watch others,

97
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,318
but there are a handful of vlogs

98
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,585
that I connect with, that
I really enjoy watching

99
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:44,250
that in a way that they don't even realize

100
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,373
has helped me become a better person.

101
00:03:47,373 --> 00:03:49,910
It's a weird thing, vlogging
and filming your life

102
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,030
is weird, but it's also really cool

103
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,746
and really special and I've
learned a lot about myself.

104
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:57,853
But I did have to tell you that.

105
00:03:57,853 --> 00:04:01,069
So speaking of, I was
dizzy all night last night.

106
00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:03,317
I laid in bed and I
thought, what is going on,

107
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:04,333
I am dizzy.

108
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,445
I'm gonna call the doctor,

109
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,459
because I am on some medicine

110
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:10,470
that it is okay to be
on when you're pregnant,

111
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,533
but I am worried,

112
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:13,930
because I notice when I take it,

113
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,218
I get super super dizzy

114
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:18,107
and I don't think that
that should be the case,

115
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:21,019
so I'm gonna call, figure that out.

116
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:22,019
Mr. Cal Cal.

117
00:04:23,435 --> 00:04:24,692
Hey.

118
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:26,787
Do you need to go potty?

119
00:04:26,787 --> 00:04:28,428
Do you need to go potty?

120
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:29,261
Huh, no?

121
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,004
Just poop?

122
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:33,534
Go hide in the corner.

123
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,367
Jackson.

124
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:36,308
- What?

125
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,449
- [Ellie] Is this the first
time you've ever seen this?

126
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:39,420
- Yeah.

127
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,030
- [Ellie] We're watching the
original Christmas movies,

128
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,780
Jackson's never seen.

129
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,173
And I think the Abominable
Snowman's coming

130
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:49,860
and that used to scare my brother Beau.

131
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,831
What do you think of the
movies you've never seen?

132
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:54,416
- I like it.

133
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,798
- [Ellie] I'm so glad.

134
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:58,175
- This reminds me of childhood.

135
00:04:58,175 --> 00:04:59,445
- [Ellie] That's why we're watching it.

136
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:00,668
- I love this.

137
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,948
- [Ellie] How was pre-school?

138
00:05:02,948 --> 00:05:05,357
Good, he passed off his letters.

139
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:07,702
- Yeah you passed off
your letters today, huh?

140
00:05:07,702 --> 00:05:08,535
Boom.

141
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,818
Do I get a one, blended
up through the sides?

142
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:11,794
Is that what I do?

143
00:05:11,794 --> 00:05:12,627
- [Ellie] Yes.

144
00:05:12,627 --> 00:05:13,460
- One, okay.

145
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,623
- [Ellie] Yes.

146
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,826
- I'll race you to the car.

147
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:17,833
- [Jared] Oh I don't know, I don't know.

148
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:21,072
Oh you beat me, you're so quick.

149
00:05:21,072 --> 00:05:22,518
You ready to spend some good quality

150
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:24,166
father-son time together?

151
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:24,999
- Yeah.

152
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:26,456
- [Jared] Yeah, what do
you want to do today?

153
00:05:26,456 --> 00:05:28,250
- A hair cut and get chocolate milk.

154
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,736
- Oooh that sounds like so much fun.

155
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:31,884
We're getting our haircuts together,

156
00:05:31,884 --> 00:05:32,788
you excited bud?

157
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:33,680
- Yeah.

158
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,681
- Yeah, should you get a
mohawk today, ya think?

159
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:38,339
Yeah, you want a mohawk?

160
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,653
Okay, when we get in
there, I want you to say,

161
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,461
I want a mohawk, okay?

162
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:42,294
- Okay.

163
00:05:42,294 --> 00:05:44,135
- And that's what they'll
cut your hair as, alright?

164
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:44,968
- Okay.

165
00:05:44,968 --> 00:05:47,051
(laughs)

166
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:51,115
- [Jared] Didn't ask for a mohawk, huh?

167
00:05:51,115 --> 00:05:52,110
- Yeah.

168
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,943
(Jared laughs)

169
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,282
- [Jared] Looks good buddy.

170
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,273
You're almost done.

171
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:56,610
- That was a great day.

172
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,854
- Well yeah, you got of couple
handsome fellas right here,

173
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:00,799
with our haircuts, what do you think?

174
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:01,671
- Good.

175
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,646
- It's good.

176
00:06:02,646 --> 00:06:05,327
Is that your first soda
pop all to yourself?

177
00:06:05,327 --> 00:06:06,160
- Uh-huh.

178
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,993
- That was so cool.

179
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:10,390
I actually think this is one
of Jackson's first soda pops,

180
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,854
but they offered one.

181
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:14,189
And you were like what's a soda pop?

182
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,862
And what flavor is it?

183
00:06:15,862 --> 00:06:16,835
- Soda.

184
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,165
- Black cherry soda.

185
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:18,998
Is it good?

186
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:19,831
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:20,816
- We'll keep this our little secret, okay?

188
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,553
We won't tell Mom about it.

189
00:06:22,553 --> 00:06:24,645
At least until we get home.

190
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,478
Let's go.

191
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,282
- I'll put this in my cup holder.

192
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:28,459
(Jared laughs)

193
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,468
- We'll see about that,
we'll see about that.

194
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:31,301
When you hang out with Dad,

195
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:33,060
you get to do some fun stuff, huh?

196
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,956
- Yeah!

197
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:35,476
- Yeah.

198
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:37,059
Joel Joel, tonight,

199
00:06:38,503 --> 00:06:41,006
no guys break it up,
break it up, break it up.

200
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:41,839
- Sorry.

201
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:42,672
- Joel tonight is the movie screening

202
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:44,139
of Psych the Movie tonight.

203
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,394
Should we try and go?

204
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:47,051
It's in one hour,
(Bonnie yells)

205
00:06:47,051 --> 00:06:51,227
oh, it's in one hour,
no it's in two hours,

206
00:06:51,227 --> 00:06:54,014
but the doors open at six.

207
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:54,939
It's five o'clock.

208
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:56,442
Do you think we can make it?

209
00:06:56,442 --> 00:06:57,730
- I can make it.

210
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,563
- Should we do it?

211
00:06:58,563 --> 00:06:59,507
- No, this is like for real.

212
00:06:59,507 --> 00:07:02,660
Joel has to cancel like YU deeds.

213
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,716
- We can do it, we can
postpone, we'll be okay.

214
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,583
- [Jared] But you have to want to do this.

215
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,537
- I want to do this.

216
00:07:07,537 --> 00:07:08,854
Do you want me to do this?

217
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:10,371
- I would love if you went and did that.

218
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,838
- (whispers) I have to ask my permission.

219
00:07:11,838 --> 00:07:12,703
Can I go?

220
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:13,989
- I want to go.

221
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:14,822
- Do you want to go with Jared?

222
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:18,076
- I have to ask Ellie if
Bonnie can go with me.

223
00:07:18,076 --> 00:07:20,326
(laughing)

224
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:22,822
Seriously though, this is like the debate,

225
00:07:22,822 --> 00:07:26,499
because so the doors open
at five, to wait in line

226
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:29,158
to get in at six, the
movie starts at seven,

227
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,687
and there's a Q&A afterwards.

228
00:07:30,687 --> 00:07:33,199
We live an hour and a half
away from there right now,

229
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,462
so we're gonna get there a little bit

230
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:37,745
after the doors open.

231
00:07:37,745 --> 00:07:39,125
So are there gonna be enough people

232
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,170
there that there's no way
we're gonna get there?

233
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:44,327
We won't know until we drive down there.

234
00:07:44,327 --> 00:07:46,590
- There hasn't been any hype
about this on the news yet.

235
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:49,589
I'm hoping that the word's
kinda been on the down low.

236
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:51,208
- But the thing is, I think
you're underestimating

237
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:52,983
the Psych audience in Utah.

238
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:53,816
- [Bonnie] Oh yeah.

239
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:54,846
- They're coming to Salt Lake,

240
00:07:54,846 --> 00:07:56,711
because people voted for it.

241
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,544
- Oh okay.

242
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,718
- I'm a Psych fan and I
haven't heard anything.

243
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:01,415
- My go is you're literally
not gonna be able to get in.

244
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,248
But I want you to,
(Jared groans)

245
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,335
I want you to go and try,

246
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,799
because what if there's room?

247
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:05,767
- Yeah.

248
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,295
- And what if you show
up and they're like,

249
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:09,422
Jared, Joel, come on in.
- We could meet Shawn and Gus.

250
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,301
- I know.

251
00:08:10,301 --> 00:08:12,833
I feel like James Roday would see me,

252
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,366
and he's like, oh yeah,
come on, front row Jared.

253
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:17,914
- Gus'll be like, hey,
there's my buddy, come on.

254
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,747
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

255
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:19,580
- Should we try this?

256
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,817
I'm kind of freaking out.
- I'm game.

257
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:24,068
- I can't believe I forgot it was today.

258
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:25,486
I thought it was like the 4th.

259
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:26,918
- Yeah, you were saying
like a week from now.

260
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:29,056
And we were making plans.
- I thought it was the 4th.

261
00:08:29,056 --> 00:08:30,811
- Ugh, okay, let's go--
- I think you should try it.

262
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:32,812
- Okay alright, we'll try, we'll try.

263
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:33,645
We're gonna try this.

264
00:08:33,645 --> 00:08:34,586
We have our wives' permission.

265
00:08:34,586 --> 00:08:35,683
We got the okay from them.

266
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:37,698
We are racing down to
Salt Lake city right now.

267
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:39,162
It is five o'clock on the dot,

268
00:08:39,163 --> 00:08:40,986
so if we do this right,

269
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,195
we will be there on time.

270
00:08:42,196 --> 00:08:43,443
It's not a matter of time.

271
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:44,275
- Mmm-hmm.

272
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:45,109
- We will be there on time,

273
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:46,580
it's a matter of capacity.

274
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,747
Kingsbury Hall has a seat
capacity of 1,992 people.

275
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:55,014
The question is, are there 1,990 people

276
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,085
and then us

277
00:08:58,085 --> 00:08:59,372
seats, you know?

278
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,984
- What if we were the 91 and 92?

279
00:09:00,984 --> 00:09:02,080
- Oh my gosh.

280
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,274
- The last two people to enter?

281
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:05,541
- All of it would be worth it.

282
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,374
- it's totally worth it.

283
00:09:06,374 --> 00:09:07,243
- Totally worth it.

284
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,826
(upbeat music)

285
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:16,820
Joel that's some skilled
driving you've done there.

286
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,065
You've navigated through
like a Tetris piece.

287
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:20,416
Just weaved in and out.

288
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,441
- I think we owe the state
of Utah a great thanks.

289
00:09:23,441 --> 00:09:25,356
For the occasion they
raised all the speed limits

290
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,189
five miles per hour.

291
00:09:26,189 --> 00:09:27,962
- They actually did.

292
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:29,043
I don't know when they did this,

293
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:31,464
but all of the speed limits
were up five miles per hour,

294
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:32,487
which helped us.

295
00:09:32,487 --> 00:09:33,879
It is 6:24.

296
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,687
The premier starts at seven.

297
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:38,103
I have confirmed through Twitter

298
00:09:38,103 --> 00:09:40,386
to other people who are seeing this event,

299
00:09:40,386 --> 00:09:44,060
that I have RSVP'd and
we're not on standby.

300
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,209
So that should be good news for us.

301
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,683
This has been the adventure of a lifetime

302
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:49,257
and whether we get in or not, Joel,

303
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:50,507
I'm happy I did it with you.

304
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,410
- It's good traveling with you, buddy.

305
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,899
- Oh my gosh is that,
- Oh that's the standby line.

306
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:55,708
- [Jared] That's gotta
be the standby line.

307
00:09:55,708 --> 00:09:56,921
- [Joel] Think I can part right there?

308
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,376
Can I park right there?
- I don't know.

309
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,853
- [Jared] Well it's worth a shot.

310
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:01,764
Is that a Psych vehicle?

311
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:03,311
That's gotta be a Psych vehicle.

312
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,144
Joel?

313
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:04,977
- [Joel] Yep.

314
00:10:04,977 --> 00:10:07,334
- [Jared] We're there.

315
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:08,167
We made it.

316
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:09,937
- We made it, everybody else behind us,

317
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:10,770
it's too bad for them.

318
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,103
- Yeah, suckers.

319
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:15,165
We are literally the last ones in line,

320
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,032
uh, but there's still standby.

321
00:10:17,032 --> 00:10:18,301
These are RSVP's so I think we're okay.

322
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:19,869
- The standby line looks pretty big too.

323
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,702
- Does it?
- I'm feeling nervous.

324
00:10:20,702 --> 00:10:21,535
- Oh my gosh.
- Yeah.

325
00:10:21,535 --> 00:10:23,179
- I am crossing my fingers.

326
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:24,722
- I bet there's a thousand people in line.

327
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,206
- [Jared] Oh jeez,
that's a lot of gas money

328
00:10:26,206 --> 00:10:27,599
to not go to see this movie.

329
00:10:27,599 --> 00:10:28,755
- It's worth it Jared, it's worth it.

330
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:30,856
- [Jared] Oh be still my heart, Joel.

331
00:10:30,856 --> 00:10:32,819
Be still my heart, I can see the signs.

332
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:33,782
- [Joel] Yeah.

333
00:10:33,782 --> 00:10:34,981
- [Jared] We're almost there.

334
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:36,846
- Psych.
- Found it.

335
00:10:36,846 --> 00:10:37,679
- [Jared] Found the pineapple.

336
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:38,512
- [Woman] There's the pineapple.

337
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,345
(Jared laughs)

338
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:40,386
- [Jared] Joel we did it!

339
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:41,219
- We're in.

340
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:42,136
- We're in!

341
00:10:44,132 --> 00:10:45,609
I'm gonna drop my camera.

342
00:10:45,609 --> 00:10:47,410
We're here we made it,

343
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:50,408
we did it, oh my gosh,
I cannot believe this.

344
00:10:50,408 --> 00:10:51,583
We're gonna go see the movie right now.

345
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,810
Hi, just go downstairs?

346
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,727
Oh my gosh.

347
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,649
(laughing)

348
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,277
I gotta get these on.

349
00:11:02,277 --> 00:11:03,822
Oh my goodness.

350
00:11:03,822 --> 00:11:04,655
Woo hoo.

351
00:11:05,673 --> 00:11:09,621
Look at this, here, do
you want some popcorn?

352
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:11,058
Grab some popcorn Joel, here you go.

353
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:13,308
(cheering)

354
00:11:15,043 --> 00:11:16,530
Are you ready for this dude?

355
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,989
- Oh my gosh.

356
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:21,322
(cheering and clapping)

357
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:24,600
- Robert, film illustrator.

358
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,933
(cheering and clapping)

359
00:11:32,469 --> 00:11:36,042
There was a contest all over Twitter,

360
00:11:36,042 --> 00:11:38,474
and they've narrowed it to 10 great cities

361
00:11:38,474 --> 00:11:40,138
in the United States.

362
00:11:40,138 --> 00:11:41,971
Chicago almost did it.

363
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,867
(crowd booing)

364
00:11:44,867 --> 00:11:46,784
Chicago came in second.

365
00:11:48,844 --> 00:11:49,927
Second place.

366
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:54,968
And there was one city
with a few more votes.

367
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:59,425
In fact, the difference
between the first place

368
00:11:59,425 --> 00:12:02,154
and second place, was double,

369
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,874
second place was--.

370
00:12:03,874 --> 00:12:06,445
(cheering)

371
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:08,242
- [Jared] Wow!

372
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:09,075
Woo yeah!

373
00:12:15,573 --> 00:12:16,406
- It's Maggie Lawson.

374
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,656
- [Jared] Yeah!

375
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,980
(clapping and cheering)

376
00:12:24,192 --> 00:12:25,025
Woo hoo!

377
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,177
Get out of town.

378
00:12:27,177 --> 00:12:29,476
This night just keeps getting better.

379
00:12:29,476 --> 00:12:30,562
What is this,
- Have a nice night.

380
00:12:30,562 --> 00:12:31,395
just a pineapple?

381
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:32,349
- [Man] It's a pineapple man.

382
00:12:32,349 --> 00:12:33,909
It has a straw.
- Ah!

383
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,513
- You can like drink stuff out of it.

384
00:12:35,513 --> 00:12:37,059
- [Jared] That's so cool Joel.

385
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,677
And we end our evening as we gaze

386
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:40,446
over the city of Salt,

387
00:12:40,446 --> 00:12:43,863
our minds nourished, our bellies laughed.

388
00:12:44,808 --> 00:12:46,224
Laughed, does that work?

389
00:12:46,224 --> 00:12:47,490
I'm trying to be funny.

390
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,744
- I'm calling it.

391
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:49,577
It's laughed.

392
00:12:49,577 --> 00:12:51,445
- [Jared] Laughed, bellies laughed,

393
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:53,112
and our hearts fall,

394
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:55,907
as we drive home.

395
00:12:55,907 --> 00:12:59,539
The two hour drive that
we did in one hour,

396
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,946
thanks go Joel.

397
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,223
- I can do it again, I can do it again.

398
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:05,556
- Seriously though, that was next level.

399
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,472
That was so much fun.

400
00:13:08,472 --> 00:13:10,972
Like Psych is the show that I,

401
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:15,384
high school, college,
that's where I spent time,

402
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,974
that's like how I was entertained.

403
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:18,477
When I had my hip surgery,

404
00:13:18,477 --> 00:13:20,854
I had three months of recovery time

405
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:22,268
at my Grandma's house,

406
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:25,668
and I had season two of Psych to watch.

407
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,124
So I know season two of Psych

408
00:13:27,124 --> 00:13:29,468
like the back of my hand.

409
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:30,635
Black and Tan,

410
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,935
a crime of fashion?

411
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:34,438
- How dare you judge us?

412
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:38,029
- Yeah, that's like my
favorite episode of Psych,

413
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:40,244
but Psych has a special place in my heart

414
00:13:40,244 --> 00:13:42,045
and I'm so happy that
we were able to be here.

415
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,717
I'm so happy that we were able to get in.

416
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:45,947
I RSVP'd, but I didn't know

417
00:13:45,947 --> 00:13:47,795
that that guaranteed you to get in,

418
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,706
because there were so many people in line,

419
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:52,592
but we did it and it was amazing.

420
00:13:52,592 --> 00:13:54,473
Thanks for driving Joel,
thanks for coming with me.

421
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:55,671
- Anytime, buddy.

422
00:13:55,671 --> 00:13:56,504
Thanks for the RSVP.

423
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:58,406
- [Jared] Hey, you're my plus one.

424
00:13:58,406 --> 00:13:59,399
- Thanks.

425
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,232
- Move over Ellie,

426
00:14:00,232 --> 00:00:00,000
you're my plus one Joel.
(laughing)
