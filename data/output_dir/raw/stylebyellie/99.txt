1
00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:01,637
- Are you ready for the news?

2
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:02,470
(Ellie laughs)

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,387
It's aaaa--

4
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:05,749
(laughing)

5
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:06,737
(clapping)
(bright music)

6
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:07,755
You have to take a bite,

7
00:00:07,755 --> 00:00:09,065
and then you'll know the gender.

8
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:09,898
Ready?

9
00:00:09,898 --> 00:00:10,792
At the same time, you have
to do it at the same time.

10
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,296
(yelling and laughing)

11
00:00:13,296 --> 00:00:15,215
- [Ellie] I'm so glad
you answered the phone

12
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:17,480
during your ultrasound.

13
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,313
- Ah good!

14
00:00:19,866 --> 00:00:20,853
(gasps)

15
00:00:20,853 --> 00:00:22,645
(laughing)

16
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:25,228
(bright music)

17
00:00:31,802 --> 00:00:33,372
- Good morning guys.

18
00:00:33,372 --> 00:00:36,002
Today is a very exciting day,

19
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,816
and I'm gonna tell you why.

20
00:00:37,816 --> 00:00:40,952
Today is the day that
I get to surprise Ellie

21
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:43,944
and let her know if we're
having a boy or a girl.

22
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,527
(bright music)

23
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,309
Not only that, we get to tell

24
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,940
the rest of our family what
we're having today too.

25
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,788
But before we do that, I've
got to run to the store

26
00:00:57,788 --> 00:00:58,653
and grab a few things

27
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,653
in order to tell Ellie a proper way.

28
00:01:08,576 --> 00:01:10,493
(beep)

29
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:14,534
I got what I need.

30
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:17,875
And the most important
thing is right here.

31
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:19,843
In this envelope are the results

32
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:22,083
of genetic testing that we did.

33
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:23,146
After these miscarriages,

34
00:01:23,146 --> 00:01:24,619
we wanted to check everything.

35
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:27,090
And in those genetic tests are the gender.

36
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,861
And I'm going to open this right now,

37
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:31,221
find out what we're having

38
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,525
and then I'm gonna go home

39
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:36,692
and I'm going to surprise
Ellie with what we are having.

40
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:40,968
I'm starting to get butterflies.

41
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:41,801
(laughs)

42
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:43,021
I'm starting to get butterflies,

43
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:44,309
oh my goodness.

44
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:45,389
I've never done this alone,

45
00:01:45,389 --> 00:01:47,400
but this is a different way

46
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,962
that we wanted to do it so,

47
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:49,879
here we go.

48
00:01:53,188 --> 00:01:55,962
(laughing)

49
00:01:55,962 --> 00:01:58,602
(clapping)
(bright music)

50
00:01:58,602 --> 00:01:59,435
Oh!

51
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,963
Oh my gosh, Ellie is going to freak.

52
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:07,213
(laughing)

53
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,278
Oh my goodness gracious.

54
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,278
Oh my goodness gracious.

55
00:02:15,194 --> 00:02:16,027
Woo hoo!

56
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,481
Okay, I've get home.

57
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:22,749
I've gotta tell my wife what we're having,

58
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:25,753
because now I know what we are having.

59
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:27,592
(laughs)

60
00:02:27,592 --> 00:02:29,313
Let's go car, come on!

61
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:30,146
Hello.

62
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,609
- [Ellie] You got the eggs?

63
00:02:33,609 --> 00:02:35,602
- I've got everything we need.

64
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:36,435
Hi boys.

65
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,986
Hey, I have something
that I want to tell you.

66
00:02:39,986 --> 00:02:41,306
- What?

67
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:42,834
- I know what we're having.

68
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,084
(laughing)

69
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,574
Yes Jackson,

70
00:02:47,574 --> 00:02:49,574
we are having cupcakes.
- When did you look?

71
00:02:49,574 --> 00:02:51,939
- We are having cupcakes.

72
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,772
- Yay.

73
00:02:52,772 --> 00:02:53,605
- [Jared] When did I look?

74
00:02:53,605 --> 00:02:54,438
- Yeah.

75
00:02:54,438 --> 00:02:55,432
- That's a little secret, okay?

76
00:02:55,432 --> 00:02:57,600
I have something for you

77
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,961
and I want to get it all set up

78
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:00,905
and then we'll go somewhere special

79
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:02,345
and we'll do this thing.

80
00:03:02,345 --> 00:03:05,701
- And in the meantime, the kiddos and I

81
00:03:05,701 --> 00:03:08,216
we are going to at least
going to start on the muffins.

82
00:03:08,216 --> 00:03:10,152
- [Jared] Perfect.

83
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:11,557
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh, I'm excited.

84
00:03:11,557 --> 00:03:13,199
- [Jared] What do you think guys?

85
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,202
Boy or girl?

86
00:03:14,202 --> 00:03:15,945
- Sprinkles sprinkle.

87
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,192
- [Jared] Sprinkles?

88
00:03:17,192 --> 00:03:18,602
We've got blue sprinkles,

89
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:20,932
we've got pink sprinkles.

90
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,349
- We got them at Lee's.

91
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:23,837
- [Jared] Yeah, good.

92
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,203
- That's his favorite grocery store.

93
00:03:25,203 --> 00:03:26,331
- [Jared] Yes it is.

94
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,331
Okay I'll be right back.

95
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,204
- I'm gonna give you one

96
00:03:31,204 --> 00:03:33,142
and you can put it in.

97
00:03:33,142 --> 00:03:33,975
Here.

98
00:03:34,956 --> 00:03:36,756
It goes right here.

99
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:38,076
- Oh yeah.

100
00:03:38,076 --> 00:03:40,108
- You want to put it here?

101
00:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,108
Put it here,

102
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:45,013
and I'm gonna do the next one.

103
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,680
(playful music)

104
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,821
- This is so cute.

105
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay baby,

106
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,816
- Come sit right here.

107
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:05,229
- we officially will know now.

108
00:04:05,229 --> 00:04:07,101
I just got a little bump.

109
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:08,389
Oh my gosh.

110
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:09,706
This is so cute.
- Okay.

111
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:12,674
- So instead of just telling you

112
00:04:12,674 --> 00:04:14,911
what gender the baby is,

113
00:04:14,911 --> 00:04:17,238
I wanted you to open up something

114
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,216
that is a gift that isn't just going to be

115
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:23,289
one and done, it's something
that you're going to have,

116
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,377
that we're going to have for awhile.

117
00:04:26,377 --> 00:04:27,689
And I think we'll love it

118
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,804
and I think we'll put it to good use

119
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:32,185
and all of that sort of thing.

120
00:04:32,185 --> 00:04:34,297
- That was so cute, I
think it went over my head.

121
00:04:34,297 --> 00:04:35,611
(laughing)

122
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:36,967
(Ellie yelling)

123
00:04:36,967 --> 00:04:38,886
- You are just so focused
on this right now.

124
00:04:38,886 --> 00:04:39,719
- That's cute.

125
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:40,552
Thank you.

126
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:41,488
- You're welcome.
- That was thoughtful.

127
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:42,321
- Okay.

128
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:44,462
- Okay, wait wait wait
wait wait wait wait,

129
00:04:44,462 --> 00:04:46,113
are you ready to find out?

130
00:04:46,113 --> 00:04:47,601
- Tell me how you felt?

131
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:50,905
- I was so thrilled and excited.

132
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:52,173
I can't give away too much,
- Obviously.

133
00:04:52,173 --> 00:04:53,477
because I'm on YouTube.

134
00:04:53,477 --> 00:04:55,020
Open it up and see for yourself.

135
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
(gasps)

136
00:04:58,081 --> 00:05:00,331
(laughing)

137
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,830
What do you think?

138
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:05,352
- Oh my crazy.

139
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:12,021
Oh my crazy, that's cute.

140
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:16,441
I knew.

141
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:18,900
(Jared laughs)

142
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,733
I knew.

143
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:21,882
- We're having a boy.

144
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:23,132
- This is cute.

145
00:05:24,105 --> 00:05:27,089
My stomach is going a million
miles a minute right now.

146
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:29,158
- Three boys Ellie,
- I can't think.

147
00:05:29,158 --> 00:05:30,711
- three boys.

148
00:05:30,711 --> 00:05:32,149
- I'm outnumbered,

149
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:32,982
- Yes you are.
- a lot.

150
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:35,138
- You and Penny are gonna
have to fend for yourselves.

151
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:37,138
- I'm a good mama's boy.

152
00:05:38,101 --> 00:05:39,637
- You're a good mama of boys.

153
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:40,599
- Yeah.

154
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:42,111
- I love you.

155
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:42,944
- I love you.

156
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,409
This is exciting.

157
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:45,903
- This is exciting.

158
00:05:45,903 --> 00:05:47,271
- What are we gonna name him?

159
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:48,784
- I don't know, I was thinking about that

160
00:05:48,784 --> 00:05:51,015
on the way home, like gosh--

161
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:53,226
- What are we going to name him?

162
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:55,886
We have talked about names and I--

163
00:05:55,886 --> 00:05:57,744
- And we've already used
up two really good ones.

164
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:59,186
- Yeah, we've thought about
names, and we're like--

165
00:05:59,186 --> 00:06:00,461
- We can't name him Jackson or Calvin.

166
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:02,127
- what are we gonna--

167
00:06:02,127 --> 00:06:03,889
- How do you feel right now?

168
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:06,666
- I'm, the kids are gonna be ecstatic.

169
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,418
- Jackson is gonna freak out.

170
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:12,827
- All day he's like, but
if I put blue sprinkles

171
00:06:12,827 --> 00:06:14,290
on it, it'll be a boy.

172
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,278
I'm like no.

173
00:06:15,278 --> 00:06:16,311
(laughs)

174
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,486
- He's kind of right.

175
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:18,841
(laughing)

176
00:06:18,841 --> 00:06:22,170
- Aww, what is he gonna look like?

177
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,143
- I don't know.

178
00:06:23,143 --> 00:06:24,904
That's gonna be the crazy thing.

179
00:06:24,904 --> 00:06:26,738
(laugh-yelling)

180
00:06:26,738 --> 00:06:27,571
- Ahhh!

181
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,487
- I can't even believe it Ellie.

182
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:31,964
- I can't wait.

183
00:06:31,964 --> 00:06:33,030
- These are little belly stickers

184
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,676
that show how many months old the baby is,

185
00:06:35,676 --> 00:06:37,322
so we can take pictures.
- That's cute.

186
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:38,871
- So that will be fun.

187
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:40,887
And then this is a memory book,

188
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:43,279
and it's all about our
baby boy's adventure.

189
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,112
- Yes.

190
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:47,231
- So you'll have things like born date,

191
00:06:47,231 --> 00:06:50,727
weight, photos, all of the information

192
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,904
and this will be cool for the baby to have

193
00:06:52,904 --> 00:06:53,888
when they're adults.

194
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:54,721
- So cute.
- You know?

195
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:57,895
- So what we're doing now
is we're making cupcakes

196
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,419
with filling on the inside,

197
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,978
and now we know what color
the filling's gonna be.

198
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:03,369
So when they take a bike--

199
00:07:03,369 --> 00:07:04,477
- I have butterflies still.

200
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:05,494
- They will know what we're having.

201
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:07,220
I have butterflies, this is insane.

202
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,328
- Three boys.
- This is so exciting.

203
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,578
(laughing)

204
00:07:14,238 --> 00:07:15,071
- Love you.

205
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,329
- Love you.
- Love you.

206
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:17,183
- Hello baby boy.

207
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:19,151
- I don't know what I'm gonna name you.

208
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:20,112
I'm dying right now.

209
00:07:20,112 --> 00:07:22,127
I can't even concentrate and think,

210
00:07:22,127 --> 00:07:24,077
I'm just like scatterbrained.

211
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,986
I'm going to put the muffins in the tins

212
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:28,961
and I can't, I'm gonna show you guys.

213
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:30,232
I am excited.

214
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,249
So the boys have tons of shoes,

215
00:07:32,249 --> 00:07:35,378
because Calvin's wearing
some of Jackson's,

216
00:07:35,378 --> 00:07:38,078
but a lot of Calvin's little shoes

217
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:39,911
have hardly been worn.

218
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:42,947
Like these church shoes, I
think he wore them twice,

219
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:45,249
and then he flippin' grew out of them.

220
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:47,614
Look at those baby shoes.

221
00:07:47,614 --> 00:07:49,697
Look at those baby shoes.

222
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:52,803
That this little boy is gonna be able

223
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:54,636
to pass down and wear.

224
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:58,692
My heart is going a
million miles a minute.

225
00:07:58,692 --> 00:07:59,760
'Cause it's like I had Jackson,

226
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,103
and it's like what is he gonna look like?

227
00:08:01,103 --> 00:08:02,809
And then I had Calvin

228
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:06,436
and now I'm like what possibly
could a third boy look like?

229
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:07,636
And then I think of my family

230
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:09,092
and how they have like three girls

231
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:12,580
or three boys and it's like
they all are so different,

232
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,676
and different personalities,
what is this little guy's

233
00:08:14,676 --> 00:08:17,113
personality gonna be like?

234
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,010
This is gonna take a
good minute to sink in,

235
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,260
to really be like holy cow.

236
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,595
I mean even if it was a girl,

237
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:27,009
it would take a minute to just sink in.

238
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,513
This is crazy.

239
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,320
I cannot wait to tell our family.

240
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,903
(gentle music)

241
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:06,981
- Good job.
- Look.

242
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:08,470
- Turn it that way.

243
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,807
- Maybe I'm gonna do this side down.

244
00:09:09,807 --> 00:09:11,910
- Woo!
- Good job.

245
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,048
- This is all they've been
wanting to do all day, guys.

246
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:17,584
These ones are for you and Calvin.

247
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:20,084
The inside color will tell you

248
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:22,449
if it's a boy or a girl.

249
00:09:22,449 --> 00:09:24,865
- But I want it to be a boy.

250
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:27,041
- You're gonna find out.
- You want it to be a what?

251
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:27,874
- A boy.

252
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:29,792
- [Jared] So when you take a big bite

253
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:31,648
and you see the color in the middle,

254
00:09:31,648 --> 00:09:34,164
that's gonna tell us if
we're having a boy or a girl.

255
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:35,246
- Do you want it?

256
00:09:35,246 --> 00:09:36,929
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

257
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:37,921
- I want to eat it too.
- Let's watch Jackson.

258
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,073
- You want me to take it off?

259
00:09:39,073 --> 00:09:40,125
- Mmm-hmm.

260
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:41,337
- And you cut it open?

261
00:09:41,337 --> 00:09:42,473
- Yeah.

262
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:44,556
- Alright, give it to me.

263
00:09:47,096 --> 00:09:47,929
- What?

264
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:51,007
What?

265
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,051
- What color?

266
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,884
- Blue!

267
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,263
- What does that mean is in Mommy's tummy?

268
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,871
- Blue, a boy!

269
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,704
- That's right.

270
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:01,071
- Are you gonna have a baby brother?

271
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:01,904
- Uh-huh.

272
00:10:01,904 --> 00:10:03,221
- Calvin, did you hear that?

273
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,088
- You're gonna have a baby brother.

274
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,005
- You're a big brother.

275
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,280
- But we want another big brother.

276
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,412
- Another big brother?

277
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,413
You are gonna be a big brother.

278
00:10:15,413 --> 00:10:17,065
- Again.

279
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:20,815
- So we're gonna have
a little tiny baby boy.

280
00:10:22,353 --> 00:10:23,608
- Is that so exciting?

281
00:10:23,608 --> 00:10:24,641
- Yeah.

282
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:27,905
- That's exactly what you wanted Jackson.

283
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,563
- I'm gonna eat those ones.

284
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,641
I can eat right here.

285
00:10:31,641 --> 00:10:32,474
- What?

286
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,705
- I love you boys.

287
00:10:35,705 --> 00:10:37,587
So here is the deal,

288
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,809
we have cupcakes right here for you guys

289
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:40,913
to bite into.

290
00:10:40,913 --> 00:10:43,881
Inside the cupcakes is a filling

291
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:45,331
and the filling
- Okay, great, okay!

292
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:47,169
- is the color of the gender.
- Okay wait wait wait wait.

293
00:10:47,169 --> 00:10:48,760
- You have to do it at the same time.

294
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,593
- We have to do this--

295
00:10:49,593 --> 00:10:50,426
- No we don't,

296
00:10:50,426 --> 00:10:51,509
no we don't!
- Yes we do!

297
00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:53,109
- [Ellie] Hurry, he's gonna get it!

298
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,717
(Ellie yells)

299
00:10:54,717 --> 00:10:56,704
(laughing)

300
00:10:56,704 --> 00:10:58,671
- We're having a baby brother.

301
00:10:58,671 --> 00:10:59,921
- A boy.
- Yeah.

302
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:04,533
- Are you gonna be a big brother?

303
00:11:04,533 --> 00:11:06,670
Yes you are!
- Yes you are!

304
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,745
- You're gonna be a big brother.

305
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:09,578
- No!

306
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:13,507
- I wonder if you're
following in Matt's footsteps.

307
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,609
- I know.
- I know, huh?

308
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:15,898
- We are like identical,

309
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:17,804
except I'm much better looking.

310
00:11:17,804 --> 00:11:19,286
(laughing)

311
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,542
- Here's the deal, you
probably already know

312
00:11:21,542 --> 00:11:23,251
the situation, but you got a cupcake,

313
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,680
inside the cupcake is filling

314
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,501
and the filling is the color of the gender

315
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:27,465
of the baby that we're having,

316
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,516
so you have to take a bite and
then you'll know the gender,

317
00:11:29,516 --> 00:11:30,676
ready, at the same time,

318
00:11:30,676 --> 00:11:32,721
you have to do it at the same time.

319
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:34,403
- I just want to rip it open.

320
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,906
- You can cut it if you want--

321
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:37,168
- I just want to rip it open!

322
00:11:37,168 --> 00:11:38,001
It's a boy!

323
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:40,113
(laughing)

324
00:11:40,113 --> 00:11:42,268
I knew it was going to be a boy.

325
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:43,716
- What does blue mean?

326
00:11:43,716 --> 00:11:45,112
- [Jared] What does blue mean?

327
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:46,494
- I told Jared the same thing.

328
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:49,689
I said I think girl,
'cause it's different,

329
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:51,592
but my heart always goes back to,

330
00:11:51,592 --> 00:11:54,120
no, I'm having a boy.

331
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,703
I am a mom of boys.

332
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,868
- We all have three boys,

333
00:11:58,868 --> 00:12:00,276
that's so funny.

334
00:12:00,276 --> 00:12:01,373
- It comes back to whatever you want,

335
00:12:01,373 --> 00:12:02,820
you don't get.

336
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,096
(laughing)

337
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:08,379
I'm so excited to have
another Joel running around.

338
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:09,815
I mean I'm just kidding.

339
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,165
Or a Gregory.

340
00:12:11,165 --> 00:12:13,718
- [Jared] Are you ready for the news?

341
00:12:13,718 --> 00:12:14,635
It's aaaa--

342
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:16,989
- Boy!
- Boy!

343
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:19,058
(laughing)

344
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,058
- Oh really?

345
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,910
- [Ellie] We like to
follow in your footsteps.

346
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,410
- [Jared] We are having a boy!

347
00:12:30,234 --> 00:12:31,067
- Really?

348
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:31,900
- [Jared] Yeah.

349
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,760
(laughing)

350
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,991
- Are you really having another boy?

351
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:35,564
- Yeah.
- Another boy.

352
00:12:35,564 --> 00:12:37,301
- [Jared] Three boys.

353
00:12:37,301 --> 00:12:39,099
- What's up Ellie?

354
00:12:39,099 --> 00:12:41,252
(Ellie laughing)

355
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:42,085
Did you find out what you're having?

356
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:42,918
- [Ellie] Yes.

357
00:12:42,918 --> 00:12:44,404
I'm so glad you answered the phone

358
00:12:44,404 --> 00:12:46,699
during your ultrasound.

359
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,489
- [Landon] We just found
out like three seconds ago.

360
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:49,448
- [Ellie] Oh my oh!

361
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,283
- What are you having?

362
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:53,074
- [Ellie] I'm having a boy.

363
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,157
- Oh my gosh.

364
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:56,353
- [Ellie] What are you having?

365
00:12:56,353 --> 00:12:57,346
- [Landon] We are having--

366
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,179
Go ahead.

367
00:12:58,179 --> 00:12:59,012
(signal tone)

368
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,325
- We're headed to Grandma Great's

369
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:03,102
and my Mom's house to
give them their cupcake.

370
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:05,877
We've spent the whole
day just making cupcakes,

371
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:08,565
being with the kids, going to family

372
00:13:08,565 --> 00:13:11,517
and the more and more
the day has progressed,

373
00:13:11,517 --> 00:13:14,041
the more I am just tickled--

374
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,090
- [Jared] Woo!

375
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:17,245
- and just can't stop
the smile off my face.

376
00:13:17,245 --> 00:13:19,373
I grew up with a lot of girls.

377
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:21,705
And it was like the cluster of girls

378
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,254
and like I have a cluster of boys.

379
00:13:24,254 --> 00:13:26,391
Jared grew up with a lot of brothers.

380
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:28,678
And I just keep thinking of the future

381
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:29,543
and how fun it's gonna be

382
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:32,532
and what adventures they
go on and it's just crazy.

383
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:34,115
Like this is crazy.

384
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,244
And I must be fit for boys.

385
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,223
(laugh-yelling)

386
00:13:39,223 --> 00:13:40,061
- You are a mom of boys.

387
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,427
- I think it's so fun.

388
00:13:42,427 --> 00:13:43,578
They're so cute.

389
00:13:43,578 --> 00:13:47,006
Boys, like my boys they love me.

390
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:48,209
And it's like weird to say that out loud,

391
00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:49,914
because it sounds kind of funny,

392
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:50,865
but like my boys love me

393
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,959
and I love that they do

394
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,472
and I can't wait to bring in another one.

395
00:13:54,472 --> 00:13:57,265
- Well it's because
you're a good mom to them,

396
00:13:57,265 --> 00:13:58,818
like no wonder they love you.

397
00:13:58,818 --> 00:13:59,651
They love me too.

398
00:13:59,651 --> 00:14:01,521
I'm not gonna shy away from this,

399
00:14:01,521 --> 00:14:03,514
if we're giving ourselves compliments.

400
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:04,483
They love me too.

401
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:06,026
- Our kids are just very cuddly.

402
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,066
- [Jared] Yeah.

403
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:08,513
- And it's like I hope this next one wants

404
00:14:08,513 --> 00:14:09,601
to cuddle as much,

405
00:14:09,601 --> 00:14:12,646
and it'll be fun, I can't wait.

406
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:13,647
Oh my gosh!

407
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:15,508
Okay, we're gonna go see Grandma Great.

408
00:14:15,508 --> 00:14:17,154
- Excited about Christmas?

409
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:18,440
Give me love.

410
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,784
Oh my goodness, oh.

411
00:14:20,784 --> 00:14:22,368
Hi.

412
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:23,618
Hi how are you?

413
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,243
Good to see you guys, come on in.

414
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:28,317
- Well thank you.
- Your lights are cute.

415
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:29,916
- Yeah, your lights look great out there.

416
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,532
We found out what we're having.

417
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:33,604
- Oh you have?

418
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:34,715
- Yes.
- Really?

419
00:14:34,715 --> 00:14:38,306
- And inside this cupcake is filling

420
00:14:38,306 --> 00:14:41,606
and the filling is the color of the gender

421
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:42,439
of the baby.

422
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:44,820
- Oh my gosh, you kids.

423
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,130
- And would like you to either cut it open

424
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:50,027
with the knife or take a big bite.

425
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:50,860
Oh no!

426
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,993
To find out what we're having.

427
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:54,826
Whoops (laughs).

428
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,175
- I gotta cut it.

429
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:57,425
- [Ellie] Okay.

430
00:15:01,091 --> 00:15:01,924
- A boy.

431
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:02,757
- Yeah.

432
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:06,011
Another boy.

433
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:09,794
- Well I had put my order in for a girl,

434
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:10,742
- Oh didn't we all.

435
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:12,644
- but I love boys too.

436
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,364
I'll accept a boy.

437
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,541
(laughing)

438
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,100
- [Ellie] The Mecham's are good at boys.

439
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:20,168
We found out what we're having today.

440
00:15:20,168 --> 00:15:21,180
(gasps)

441
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,407
We're having another boy.

442
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:24,240
- Ah good!

443
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,978
- [Ellie] Three in a row.

444
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,253
- Three boys!

445
00:15:31,354 --> 00:15:33,666
- [Ellie] We're having a boy.

446
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,749
- Oh my gosh.

447
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:36,875
Are you serious?

448
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,042
- [Ellie] Yes.

449
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:41,617
- They're having a boy.

450
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:45,504
They have Jackson and
Calvin and another boy.

451
00:15:45,504 --> 00:15:47,771
- His eyes.
- That's a lot of boys, huh?

452
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:51,098
- [Jared] We are having a boy.

453
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:52,578
- Well that's a big surprise, huh?

454
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:53,828
- [Jared] Yeah.

455
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:57,689
- 'Cause it's a boy.
- Boy!

456
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:59,729
(yelling)

457
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:03,997
- Jackson and Calvin are
gonna have a brother.

458
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,346
- [Ellie] That's how I think too.

459
00:16:05,346 --> 00:16:07,995
(laughing)

460
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,662
We are having a boy.

461
00:16:10,734 --> 00:16:11,693
- Oh!

462
00:16:11,693 --> 00:16:13,246
(Ellie laughing)

463
00:16:13,246 --> 00:16:14,634
- Were you a little shocked?

464
00:16:14,634 --> 00:16:15,889
- [Ellie] I was shocked.

465
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:16,880
- [Ellie] Whenever you want.

466
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,303
- But the answer
- This is exciting.

467
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:20,085
- is inside.
- is in the middle.

468
00:16:20,085 --> 00:16:22,016
- This is exciting.
- Okay now, you just hold on--

469
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:23,821
- [Jared] You gotta do it
at the same time though.

470
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:26,209
- Okay, you gotta do it at the same time.

471
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:27,258
- [Ellie] Unless you're Jared's mom,

472
00:16:27,258 --> 00:16:29,317
she gets excited and just rips it.

473
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,824
- Okay you ready?

474
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,241
On 17, one, two--

475
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:36,083
(laughing)

476
00:16:37,284 --> 00:16:38,117
Oh.

477
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:40,747
- No!
- That's funny.

478
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,124
- Oh that's funny, my three sons.

479
00:16:43,124 --> 00:16:44,048
- Congratulations.
- Yep.

480
00:16:44,048 --> 00:16:45,395

00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:47,669
- You make good boys.

483
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,798
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

484
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:49,631
- You make good boys.

485
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:52,170
- Thanks guys.
- Oh how cute.

486
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,157
- Yeah, that was fun.

487
00:16:53,157 --> 00:16:55,112
- Can you imagine another little one?

488
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:56,308
- That's crazy.

489
00:16:56,308 --> 00:16:58,035
- Another one.
- It's gonna be so cute.

490
00:16:58,035 --> 00:17:00,268
- You boys are just gonna be--

491
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,351
- Check hard?

492
00:17:02,246 --> 00:17:03,326
- We literally said that today.

493
00:17:03,326 --> 00:17:05,625
Jared's like your dad's
gonna want to give him back.

494
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,127
(laughing)

495
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,226
- No no.

496
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:09,829
- [Jared] We can read
you guys like a book.

497
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,920
(bright music)

498
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,955
- Today has been crazy.

499
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:16,155
- We're having a boy.

500
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:18,345
- I am speechless.

501
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:19,925
- You know what we have to do next?

502
00:17:19,925 --> 00:17:21,015
- I'm speechless.

503
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:21,848
Find a name.

504
00:17:21,848 --> 00:17:22,866
- Find a name.

505
00:17:22,866 --> 00:17:24,936
- I literally have been on the couch

506
00:17:24,936 --> 00:17:26,858
and I keep texting Jared,

507
00:17:26,858 --> 00:17:30,475
and I have, and I remember
this name last time, Mason.

508
00:17:30,475 --> 00:17:31,308
- Yeah.

509
00:17:31,308 --> 00:17:32,141
- And you're like no,

510
00:17:32,141 --> 00:17:33,915
but every time I read it, it sticks out.

511
00:17:33,915 --> 00:17:34,811
- Huh?

512
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,838
- I really like the name Mason.

513
00:17:35,838 --> 00:17:37,509
- That's interesting.

514
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:39,822
It's always to have fun to have names

515
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:41,581
that just like ring a bell.

516
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:42,414
- Yeah.

517
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:43,993
- Or like yeah, it's something
that resonates with you.

518
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:46,058
- Jackson, Calvin and Mason.

519
00:17:46,058 --> 00:17:46,891
- Yeah.

520
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:48,021
- I think it's cute.

521
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,602
- Yeah, we got three boys.
- We'll have to see.

522
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,811
- Yeah.

523
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,660
I am so excited.

524
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,683
- I am too.

525
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:57,619
- I can't wait to get
newborn clothes again,

526
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,765
set up a room.

527
00:17:58,765 --> 00:17:59,853
Penny's like rub my belly.

528
00:17:59,853 --> 00:18:01,008
- Penny is right here

529
00:18:01,008 --> 00:18:02,781
and she's making me rub
- Where she's sprawled out.

530
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:05,180
- her belly with my foot.

531
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,180
- Guys I hope you enjoyed the vlog.

532
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,956
We loved today, we are pooped.

533
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,917
We've driven around up and down town,

534
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,243
to see family.

535
00:18:13,243 --> 00:18:15,451
And it was wonderful, it was amazing.

536
00:18:15,451 --> 00:18:16,779
- And the cupcakes were amazing.

537
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:17,612
- They were really good.

538
00:18:17,612 --> 00:18:18,585
They were so tasty.

539
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:21,325
They were as good as they looked, so.

540
00:18:21,325 --> 00:18:22,158
