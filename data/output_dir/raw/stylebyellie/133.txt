1
00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:01,999
We're sitting down here
waiting to get on a train,

2
00:00:01,999 --> 00:00:04,721
because, today, we're going--
To Hong Kong!

3
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:05,805
Hong Kong.

4
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,689
A lot of you guys are like,
"Are you going to Hong Kong".

5
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:08,783
We are today.

6
00:00:08,783 --> 00:00:10,529
I'm so excited, but, Natalie, hi, girl.

7
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:11,362
Hello.

8
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:12,895
Is in the middle of--
I'm so beautiful.

9
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:14,336
She's in the middle of getting ready.

10
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,038
You do look beautiful, and I was like,

11
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:17,502
"Where did you get your skirt".

12
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:20,325
Look at this velvet skirt,
and she got it on Amazon.

13
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:23,431
I have so many friends, and, my cousin,

14
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:24,376
she buys all of her clothes on Amazon.

15
00:00:24,376 --> 00:00:26,583
- [Natalie] You go like
this, and it wiggles.

16
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,656
You look so cute!

17
00:00:28,656 --> 00:00:30,073
You look darling.

18
00:00:31,046 --> 00:00:32,588
I'm gonna have to get my game on

19
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:33,720
and start shopping on Amazon for clothes.

20
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,112
- [Jared] Get your skirt game, girl.

21
00:00:35,112 --> 00:00:36,065
Yeah.

22
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,648
(upbeat music)

23
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:54,159
- [Jared] Everyone
create a circle of trust,

24
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,202
a circle of safety and love.

25
00:00:56,202 --> 00:00:57,513
He's in the circle of trust.

26
00:00:57,513 --> 00:00:58,346
Okay, good.

27
00:00:58,346 --> 00:00:59,429
Aw, so sweet.

28
00:01:01,555 --> 00:01:03,638
Look at all these people.

29
00:01:05,423 --> 00:01:06,941
Welcome to Hong Kong, Ellie.

30
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,774
You're in the middle.

31
00:01:07,774 --> 00:01:09,802
That means you have to break dance.

32
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:11,421
Yes! No!
I'll throw a beat.

33
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,254
Don't say no.

34
00:01:12,254 --> 00:01:13,597
I'll throw a beat. You break dance.

35
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:15,678
- [Ellie] I don't wanna break dance.

36
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:18,261
(upbeat music)

37
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:24,525
(laughs)

38
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:30,861
Yeah!

39
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,789
I feel like we're sardines in a can.

40
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,505
Traveling is always packed.

41
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,255
- [Jared] Yes, it is.

42
00:01:39,038 --> 00:01:40,440
We're trying to get on the bullet train.

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,581
Got it.

44
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:45,748
Goal is to not move while
in the subway when it stops.

45
00:01:48,585 --> 00:01:49,617
You're gonna step.

46
00:01:49,617 --> 00:01:50,450
Mind your step.

47
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,357
I didn't step.

48
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:53,607
(shouting)

49
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:56,503
She's got the Matrix!

50
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:58,880
This is so easy.

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,835
"This is so easy," he says.

52
00:02:00,835 --> 00:02:03,403
So easy he couldn't do it.

53
00:02:03,403 --> 00:02:04,964
Are you a kung fu master?

54
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:07,055
With one foot, he says.

55
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,555
One foot, he says.

56
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,259
Dang it!

57
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,842
(upbeat music)

58
00:02:21,846 --> 00:02:24,219
Do you see that scaffolding?

59
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:25,052
- [Ellie] Yes.

60
00:02:25,052 --> 00:02:26,772
- [Jared] That's all made from bamboo.

61
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:27,943
Isn't that cool?

62
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:29,379
- [Ellie] That's crazy.

63
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:30,454
They did the same thing in China,

64
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:33,176
but we're in Hong Kong right now,

65
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:34,246
and it's cool to see the difference

66
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:36,001
between Hong Kong and China.

67
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,712
Hong Kong was under British
rule for like 100 years,

68
00:02:39,712 --> 00:02:43,072
and there's a lot more
Western influence, I think,

69
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,621
and you see more McDonald's
and 7-Elevens and circle K,

70
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:49,097
and people are driving on
the opposite side of the road

71
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:53,863
than in the United States, but,
even just across the river,

72
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,886
it's crazy to see the
differences between China

73
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:57,136
and Hong Kong.

74
00:02:57,136 --> 00:03:00,636
(noise drowns out speech)

75
00:03:01,935 --> 00:03:03,426
What a small world.

76
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:07,910
We are in Hong Kong, and we
just got to the LDS church.

77
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,156
We went to the bathroom.

78
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:14,030
We didn't make it in time to
go to the sacrament meeting,

79
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,969
the worship meeting, and Jared
met someone that he knows

80
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,834
from Utah, and he works here now.

81
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:22,903
Is that not crazy?

82
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,575
And Jase and his friend met someone

83
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:29,093
that they knew in Hawaii, so
two people that we both met

84
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:32,363
from different parts of the world.

85
00:03:32,363 --> 00:03:33,623
They're just catching up.

86
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:36,206
(gentle music)

87
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:45,044
I'm noticing that the world
is smaller and smaller

88
00:03:45,044 --> 00:03:46,070
every single day.

89
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,250
We are here in Hong Kong, and
a buddy of mine from college,

90
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,380
Scott, lives here, and I had
no idea that you were here.

91
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,213
TFN told me.

92
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:54,413
I was like, "That name sounds so familiar,

93
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:56,042
"like why is that so familiar".

94
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:56,875
He showed me your picture.

95
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,762
I was like, "Oh my gosh, I
went to school with you,"

96
00:03:58,762 --> 00:04:00,525
but Scott is here in Hong Kong.

97
00:04:00,525 --> 00:04:01,665
He's been here for like four years,

98
00:04:01,665 --> 00:04:03,425
and he's been doing some amazing things

99
00:04:03,425 --> 00:04:06,339
that is changing the world of Hong Kong

100
00:04:06,339 --> 00:04:09,280
and the people who come here to work.

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,113
Basically, in Hong Kong, there's issues

102
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,116
around forced labor with
migrant workers from

103
00:04:12,116 --> 00:04:13,483
the Philippines and Indonesia.

104
00:04:13,483 --> 00:04:17,265
We've set up a nonprofit employment agency

105
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:18,966
to help these people find jobs ethically

106
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,920
and kind of prevent the debt
bondage that occurs here.

107
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:25,515
Yeah, and he's gone
from, in over the course

108
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,593
of two, three years--

109
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:27,426
- [Scott] Three years.

110
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:30,582
Three years, from placing 90 per year

111
00:04:30,582 --> 00:04:32,020
to like 1,000.

112
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,073
You're on the pace for
like 1,000 per year,

113
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:37,856
so 1,000 people are getting
out of terrible situations

114
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:41,097
into safe working environments
and that sort of thing.

115
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:44,555
Yeah, we're gonna place
about 1,000 people this year,

116
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:46,770
which is a lot of people
that we're helping,

117
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,415
but we also see opportunity
to help a lot more

118
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:50,451
over the next couple years.

119
00:04:50,451 --> 00:04:53,163
- [Jared] That's so cool, and
what's the nonprofit called?

120
00:04:53,163 --> 00:04:54,370
The Fair Employment Agency.

121
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,896
That's so cool, man.

122
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,766
How cool is it?

123
00:04:56,766 --> 00:04:59,902
Like, a friend of mine
from college is doing this,

124
00:04:59,902 --> 00:05:02,156
changing so many people's lives.

125
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:03,027
Awesome, dude.

126
00:05:03,027 --> 00:05:04,181
That's so cool.

127
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:06,764
(gentle music)

128
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,994
(moves into pleasant music)

129
00:05:35,906 --> 00:05:37,639
(record scratching)

130
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,593
Well, that was funny.

131
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,528
We all took a picture on
the stairs over there,

132
00:05:42,528 --> 00:05:47,018
and all of these girls from
Hong Kong, I'm guessing--

133
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:48,607
They were, like, they were laughing,

134
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:49,988
and they were pointing
at Jared the whole time

135
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,261
we were all taking a group picture.

136
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:53,047
Well, yeah, 'cause we
were waiting to get down,

137
00:05:53,047 --> 00:05:53,880
because we didn't know if
the picture was being taken--

138
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,872
He was being goofy.

139
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:56,270
I was doing some poses here and there,

140
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,736
and they're all just laughing,
and then the mom comes up

141
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:00,527
to me and was like, "'Scuse me.

142
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:02,113
"You take picture with these girls".

143
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,542
- [Ellie] It was so cute.

144
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:04,530
- [Jared] It was so funny.

145
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,363
They all--

146
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:06,196
- [Ellie] I stood back and filmed.

147
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:07,375
I'm like, "You want me in it".

148
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:08,325
No, okay, just Jared.

149
00:06:08,325 --> 00:06:09,158
My first thought was, like, "Oh, good.

150
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:10,928
"They watch our Youtube
channel," but, nope,

151
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:12,904
they just liked me for my personality.

152
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:14,897
It was so cute.

153
00:06:14,897 --> 00:06:16,934
Do you ever get the feeling that our wives

154
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:20,039
like each other better than they like us?

155
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,039
- [Joel] It's confirmed.

156
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:25,038
I just think they like spending more time

157
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:27,784
with themselves than they do us.

158
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:29,700
If they didn't need us,
they wouldn't have us.

159
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,732
Probably not.

160
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,140
That's where you come in, though.

161
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,890
I get a lot from you.

162
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,375
Thanks for saying that, Joel.

163
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,503
I needed to hear that.

164
00:06:39,503 --> 00:06:40,977
Bros.

165
00:06:40,977 --> 00:06:41,810
Before--

166
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:43,586
- [Joel] Clothes?

167
00:06:43,586 --> 00:06:44,733
Wives.

168
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:46,683
I think something that's been
interesting that is cool--

169
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:48,789
And then you hold it up to
your eye, and you're like--

170
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,295
Is the money here.

171
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:52,437
Then, your eye looks really fancy.

172
00:06:52,437 --> 00:06:55,454
It's like every time we
get money in Hong Kong,

173
00:06:55,454 --> 00:07:00,112
it's different than in China,
and it's just very fancy.

174
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:02,529
It feels cool, but that's 10.

175
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,162
What does that mean here?

176
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:07,309
It's 10 here, but what
does it mean in the U.S.?

177
00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:09,569
You divide it by nine,
so it's like a dollar.

178
00:07:09,569 --> 00:07:10,995
Divide it by eight.

179
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:12,183
It's like a dollar.

180
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:13,345
- [Ellie] Cool. I like it.

181
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:14,381
It feels weird, huh?

182
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:15,214
- [Ellie] Yeah.

183
00:07:15,214 --> 00:07:16,715
I wonder--

184
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:17,851
- [Ellie] Doesn't.

185
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:18,684
Doesn't tear.

186
00:07:18,684 --> 00:07:19,703
- [Ellie] Good.

187
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:20,684
That's crazy.

188
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:21,543
These don't tear.

189
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:25,376
Maybe the U.S. should
upgrade their dollars.

190
00:07:29,402 --> 00:07:32,318
(heavily accented speech)

191
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:33,255
Okay, okay good.

192
00:07:33,255 --> 00:07:35,215
Our next stop of the day
is at the Chi Lin Nunnery.

193
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:38,765
This is a temple which
is very sacred to them,

194
00:07:38,765 --> 00:07:40,584
and we are going to walk through,

195
00:07:40,584 --> 00:07:42,112
and we're going to be very respectful,

196
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,509
but it's just absolutely beautiful.

197
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:46,224
I'm not sure exactly what we can

198
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,776
take pictures of and everything.

199
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,398
Like I said, we wanna be respectful

200
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:51,883
of what they hold scared,

201
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:55,117
and we are going to go
through and admire the beauty

202
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:58,624
and the history of the Chi Lin Nunnery.

203
00:07:58,624 --> 00:08:01,207
(gentle music)

204
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,347
This has been a very peaceful Sunday,

205
00:08:16,347 --> 00:08:20,185
and this is a very peaceful, sacred place,

206
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,685
and it's beautiful to be here.

207
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:25,414
This is amazing.

208
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:26,508
This is behind--

209
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:28,084
The trees are just like the bonsai trees.

210
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:28,917
Is that what they call they call 'em?

211
00:08:28,917 --> 00:08:32,426
- [Joel] Yeah, no, they're banyan trees.

212
00:08:32,426 --> 00:08:33,259
I'm gonna say that wrong

213
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,933
if I try and say what they are called,

214
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,428
but they're beautiful.

215
00:08:36,428 --> 00:08:37,611
I love being here with you.

216
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:40,148
This is like the coolest thing ever.

217
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,650
This has been a really good day.

218
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,233
(gentle music)

219
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,032
All day, I kept thinking
about our relationship Q&A

220
00:08:55,032 --> 00:08:57,522
and thinking, "I don't
know if I wanna post it".

221
00:08:57,522 --> 00:09:00,181
I feel a little nervous to post it,

222
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:02,093
because, the more I've been here,

223
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:03,816
I've never been out of the country,

224
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:04,839
especially like this.

225
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:08,785
What works for one person
does not work for another.

226
00:09:08,785 --> 00:09:11,131
May not, yeah.
Yeah.

227
00:09:11,131 --> 00:09:14,464
And I have loved seeing the culture here

228
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:18,829
and how other people do things, you know?

229
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:22,770
It's a unique experience
being able to live life

230
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,367
somewhere else, and we've
only been here for a few days,

231
00:09:25,367 --> 00:09:28,001
but you get to see life
through someone else's eyes

232
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:32,888
for a minute, and, like we
said in the relationship Q&A,

233
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:35,943
things may not work for
you like they do for us,

234
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,776
but it's the principle--

235
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,884
I just keep reflecting on that.

236
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:41,801
I think Jared and I are
able to understand more

237
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,705
of comments that have
come in that are different

238
00:09:47,705 --> 00:09:49,769
for them to see in our life.

239
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:52,936
Things that are the norm where we live

240
00:09:53,878 --> 00:09:55,841
is not the norm where a lot of you live,

241
00:09:55,841 --> 00:09:59,499
and our demographic is so large,
and I think that it's nice

242
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:02,764
to get out of our space--
Our bubble.

243
00:10:02,764 --> 00:10:06,311
Into another and open our eyes more,

244
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,628
and it's been amazing to be here,

245
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:09,680
and it's been amazing to hear the culture.

246
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,572
That's always been a goal of mine--

247
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:12,922
Emotional.

248
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,647
Yeah, it's always been a
goal of mine to take myself

249
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:18,814
out of my shoes and to see
perspective from all around.

250
00:10:19,705 --> 00:10:21,216
And you're very good at that.

251
00:10:21,216 --> 00:10:24,846
And being out of the country,
a very different country

252
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,407
at that, has been just a
really great opportunity

253
00:10:27,407 --> 00:10:28,856
to do just that.

254
00:10:28,856 --> 00:10:31,154
Was that a bird poop or rain?

255
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:33,544
I think it was a bird poop.

256
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:34,530
Yep, right there.

257
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,363
That's the bird right there.

258
00:10:35,363 --> 00:10:37,226
(laughs)

259
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:40,005
- [Ellie] Did you hear it?

260
00:10:40,005 --> 00:10:41,155
Where is he?

261
00:10:41,155 --> 00:10:42,155
Right there.

262
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:44,622
That was hilarious.

263
00:10:44,622 --> 00:10:45,455
Right there.

264
00:10:45,455 --> 00:10:46,288
I see him right there.

265
00:10:46,288 --> 00:10:47,121
- [Jared] Yeah, right there.

266
00:10:47,121 --> 00:10:48,825
- [Ellie] That was hilarious.

267
00:10:48,825 --> 00:10:50,271
Well, we almost got pooped on by a bird.

268
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:52,375
Yeah, I totally heard that.

269
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,987
Well, and even talking,
like, I've never met

270
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,941
Natalie and Richie, but meeting
them and talking with them

271
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:01,590
and what they do for a
living, and they are speakers,

272
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,449
and she is definitely a motivated speaker,

273
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,906
and just talking to her this week,

274
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:09,175
I'm like it's just calmed my nerves

275
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:13,211
I didn't even know that I had,
and it's been eye-opening,

276
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:14,044
and I've enjoyed meeting new people.

277
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:15,533
Makes you wanna be a go-getter.

278
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,612
Yeah, they're awesome.

279
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:20,566
I really enjoy the people
that we put ourselves around.

280
00:11:20,566 --> 00:11:23,637
It makes us better people
because of the people we have

281
00:11:23,637 --> 00:11:25,356
surrounded ourselves with.

282
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:26,189
Yeah, and what's the saying?

283
00:11:26,189 --> 00:11:27,329
You're the average of the five people

284
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:29,521
you surround yourself with the most.

285
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:31,415
Surround yourself with good people.

286
00:11:31,415 --> 00:11:33,139
I'm just very grateful, and I love you.

287
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:33,972
And I love you.

288
00:11:33,972 --> 00:11:34,805
And I am grateful for this opportunity,

289
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:37,482
and we are celebrating eight
years of marriage this month.

290
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:38,547
This month.

291
00:11:38,547 --> 00:11:40,305
Holy crap, eight years.

292
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,723
That's a long time, and I kept thinking,

293
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:45,935
when we came here, 'cause this
is such a beautiful place,

294
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,352
of when Jared proposed to me,

295
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,460
and the conversation that Jared and I had

296
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,180
when he proposed to me.

297
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,710
I remember it in my head clear as day.

298
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,981
I remember what I was wearing.

299
00:12:01,981 --> 00:12:05,120
I just remember thinking,
like, I really wonder--

300
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,953
What are we gonna be like?

301
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:09,864
And I would have been
happy if our original plan

302
00:12:09,864 --> 00:12:12,472
turned out, but I think
I'm even more grateful

303
00:12:12,472 --> 00:12:15,587
for where we're at now
with our relationship,

304
00:12:15,587 --> 00:12:18,847
with our kids, and I miss them so much.

305
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:20,162
We video chatted with them yesterday,

306
00:12:20,162 --> 00:12:21,816
and it was the sweetest thing.

307
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:24,698
Our boys are so happy, and
I feel like they're mature.

308
00:12:24,698 --> 00:12:26,218
Jackson's so mature.

309
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:28,271
When I talked to him, I was
nervous how he would be,

310
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,496
but he was like just happy, you know?

311
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:33,267
He's a good boy.

312
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:35,431
Can't wait to go home and
kiss them and give them gifts.

313
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:36,264
Yeah.

314
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:37,525
He's like, "Did you get a gift,"

315
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,727
'cause I told him when I left, I said,

316
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:41,656
"We're gonna leave for a while,

317
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:44,494
"but we'll get you something special,"

318
00:12:44,494 --> 00:12:45,878
and that kinda always helps kids.

319
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:46,861
It helps me.

320
00:12:46,861 --> 00:12:48,192
You'll be gone?

321
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,081
Bring me home some flowers.

322
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:50,770
Yeah, absolutely.

323
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,935
Well, we're gonna go look at the temple

324
00:12:51,935 --> 00:12:55,824
a little bit more, because
it's stinking beautiful.

325
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:57,618
It's beautiful like you.

326
00:12:57,618 --> 00:12:58,702
Thank you.

327
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:01,517
(energetic music)

328
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:02,730
Morning.

329
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,778
We are at a book factory right now,

330
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:07,997
and, right here behind us,
they are printing a book.

331
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,587
- [Ellie] 19,000 pages.

332
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,397
- [Jared] 784, five, six, seven, eight.

333
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:16,085
Look at this just shovel
through the pages.

334
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:16,918
It's air-powered.

335
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,036
It's a vacuum.

336
00:13:18,036 --> 00:13:19,751
The suction cups pick it up,

337
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:21,649
this suction cup pushes it over,

338
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,757
and then the feet right here grab it

339
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:25,882
and throw it into the
machine, and that's where

340
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,504
it gets all the lines
printed and everything.

341
00:13:28,504 --> 00:13:30,478
- [Jared] That is incredible.

342
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:33,021
How many thousands of pages
do you think are here?

343
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:35,829
That stack over there is
20,000, just that small stack.

344
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,343
- [Jared] This is probably three, 400,000.

345
00:13:39,343 --> 00:13:40,837
Yeah.

346
00:13:40,837 --> 00:13:41,957
That's amazing.

347
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,366
It makes my printer feel so inadequate.

348
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,199
(laughs)

349
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,481
Don't ever show my printer this footage.

350
00:13:46,481 --> 00:13:48,056
I know.

351
00:13:48,056 --> 00:13:49,775
They'd be so jealous.

352
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,383
It's not every day you
get welcomed in China

353
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,970
with a red carpet, Joel.

354
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,861
Yeah, just today.

355
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:56,694
- [Jared] Just today.

356
00:13:56,694 --> 00:13:57,527
- [Bonnie] What is happening?

357
00:13:57,527 --> 00:13:58,840
I'm so excited to eat!

358
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,673
This is fun.

359
00:13:59,673 --> 00:14:00,630
We're going to Hot Pot, which, apparently,

360
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,819
is like so stinking good.

361
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:03,652
I don't know.

362
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,085
WE've never been here, but
they have a red carpet for us,

363
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:07,102
which is so nice.
Smells amazing.

364
00:14:07,102 --> 00:14:08,058
- [Jared] Yeah, it smells really good.

365
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:09,407
Hi, ni hao.

366
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,240
All right, everyone.

367
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,775
Have we learned our lesson from last time?

368
00:14:12,775 --> 00:14:14,579
You boys all know,
'cause you've come here.

369
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:16,898
We're having a lunch meeting again today,

370
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:18,735
and none of us are sitting until--

371
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:19,568
The big boss.

372
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:20,783
Big boss comes.

373
00:14:20,783 --> 00:14:21,794
Until big boss comes in.

374
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,419
Jimmy, you're a big boss.
(crosstalk)

375
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,677
They are gonna give us a big thing

376
00:14:24,677 --> 00:14:26,200
of boiling water.

377
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,125
We will open these, and
rinse your stuff in them,

378
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,797
pour them out, put 'em off to the side.

379
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,697
Watch and see what Jimmy does first.

380
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:32,605
- [Bonnie] You wash your own dishes?

381
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,766
And then you'll wash your
dishes before you eat.

382
00:14:34,766 --> 00:14:37,483
These are sanitary, but
they have you do it again

383
00:14:37,483 --> 00:14:39,332
just so you feel good about it.

384
00:14:39,332 --> 00:14:40,246
- [Ellie] Cool.

385
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,187
He's gonna sit down.

386
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:43,845
He's gonna sit down where he can see,

387
00:14:43,845 --> 00:14:45,275
where he can see the door.

388
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:46,376
He does?

389
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:48,118
That's where he usually sits

390
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:49,766
so he can sit down where
he can see the door,

391
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:51,069
people coming in and out.

392
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:51,902
- [Ellie] I didn't know that.

393
00:14:51,902 --> 00:14:54,137
Yeah, that's why they sit down first.

394
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:57,804
(speaking foreign language)

395
00:15:02,683 --> 00:15:04,935
Right now, they're
talking about which meal

396
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:05,768
they're gonna have first.

397
00:15:05,768 --> 00:15:06,601
- [Ellie] No, they're not.

398
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:07,684
I don't know what they're saying.

399
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:10,654
- [Ellie] Jimmy is gonna teach us how--

400
00:15:10,654 --> 00:15:11,487
- [Bonnie] Big boss man.

401
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,095
- [Ellie] Big boss man.

402
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:14,673
We call him that too.

403
00:15:14,673 --> 00:15:18,080
Is put our potstickers in here, cook it,

404
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,270
take it out, put it in our sauce.

405
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,550
This is like the cook, to cook it,

406
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:23,093
and then this is your flavor.

407
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:23,926
- [Ellie] Awesome.

408
00:15:23,926 --> 00:15:26,789
Is essentially the way
that I'm figuring it out.

409
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:31,053
Now, all of them is ready
to eat except this one.

410
00:15:31,053 --> 00:15:31,886
- [Joel] In the hot pot.

411
00:15:31,886 --> 00:15:34,594
You have to put inside, the four of you.

412
00:15:34,594 --> 00:15:37,503
Others, you can, you
know, pick it by yourself.

413
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:39,086
Mm, it's so good.

414
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:41,771
Noodles are amazing.

415
00:15:41,771 --> 00:15:44,089
- [Jared] This is what the
entire table looks like

416
00:15:44,089 --> 00:15:46,615
with almost all of the food.

417
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,448
- [Ellie] This is amazing.

418
00:15:47,448 --> 00:15:48,505
- [Jared] This is so crazy.

419
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,592
Hey!

420
00:15:49,592 --> 00:15:51,394
This is the lining of a cow's stomach.

421
00:15:51,394 --> 00:15:52,227
- [Jared] Right over there.

422
00:15:52,227 --> 00:15:53,461
- [Natalie] This is our favorite sauce.

423
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,894
- [Jared] But then we've
got this table over here

424
00:15:54,894 --> 00:15:57,018
which has a lot more stuff on it too.

425
00:15:57,018 --> 00:15:58,412
He's making some fried rice right now.

426
00:15:58,412 --> 00:15:59,800
This is incredible.

427
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,205
This is so delicious.

428
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:03,545
The first several days
while we have been here,

429
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,389
it has been more business.

430
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:07,154
We've talked with owners.

431
00:16:07,154 --> 00:16:10,521
We've been with our friends
that work here in China,

432
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,935
and, now, we are kind of on more

433
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:15,100
of the tourist-y stuff today.

434
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,443
We are taking a three-hour train ride.

435
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,727
I'm not quite sure where.

436
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:19,889
I don't know where it is.

437
00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:20,848
- [Ellie] Just following everyone.

438
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:24,335
Bullet train, and it goes
like 200 miles per hour.

439
00:16:24,335 --> 00:16:25,168
- [Bonnie] 300!

440
00:16:25,168 --> 00:16:26,465
300 miles per hour!

441
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:28,793
Girl, that's crazy!

442
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:29,868
- [Jared] I can't even think that fast.

443
00:16:29,868 --> 00:16:34,454
Tonight, tomorrow will
be a fun, tourist-y day.

444
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:35,756
Huh, Bon?

445
00:16:35,756 --> 00:16:37,178
I'm having fun with you.

446
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:38,540
I know. This is incredible.

447
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,350
I feel like I haven't even vlogged tons

448
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,503
personally or especially with Bonnie,

449
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:46,082
but we've been walking
like seven miles a day.

450
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,164
We've been running, so now I
can take a little breather now.

451
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:50,395
Wasn't that food delicious, Bonnie?

452
00:16:50,395 --> 00:16:51,892
Our feet are swollen.

453
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:54,199
Our faces are swollen.

454
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:55,865
Our tummies are swollen.

455
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,827
Oh my gosh, I wish I could
have filmed that experience

456
00:16:57,827 --> 00:16:58,758
that we just went through.

457
00:16:58,758 --> 00:17:01,494
We all just rushed into this.

458
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:03,388
We're going into the bullet train,

459
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:05,659
and everyone is like fighting for space.

460
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:07,248
It's crazy.

461
00:17:07,248 --> 00:17:08,080
Here we go.

462
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,001
Bonnie] Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

463
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:09,877
Move, move move.

464
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:10,993
Here we go.

465
00:17:10,993 --> 00:17:11,826
14B and A.

466
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,012
- [Ellie] Oh, you're so hot.

467
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:18,845
I know. It's really hot in here.

468
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,431
- [Ellie] This is a lot
more space than I thought.

469
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,568
This is like first class.

470
00:17:23,568 --> 00:17:24,401
This is very nice.

471
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,207
No, this is like Delta common.

472
00:17:26,207 --> 00:17:27,146
This is nice.

473
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:28,625
We're going on a three-hour bullet train.

474
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,594
- [Jared] Bullet train.

475
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:31,978
- [Ellie] Jackson, thinking of you.

476
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:32,811
Look at these trains, Jackson.

477
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:34,846
This is so cool.

478
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,657
- [Ellie] These are the tracks.

479
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:37,707
What are you looking at?

480
00:17:37,707 --> 00:17:39,829
Sometimes you give me looks,

481
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:42,731
and it makes me laugh and scared.

482
00:17:42,731 --> 00:17:45,680
Bonnie scares me sometimes.

483
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,785
♪ We're going on a trip ♪

484
00:17:46,785 --> 00:17:49,023
♪ In our favorite rocket ship ♪

485
00:17:49,023 --> 00:17:50,382
What are you doing, Jar?

486
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:53,456
I'm getting your audio adapter

487
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:55,203
so you can listen to that book.

488
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:56,036
- [Ellie] Oh, thanks.

489
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,082
- [Jared] And I've got your headphones.

490
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:58,996
- [Ellie] And Jared has his.

491
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,169
My Nintendo Switch.

492
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,688
- [Ellie] Heck yeah,
I wanna play with you.

493
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:02,844
I wanna play Mario, yeah.

494
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:04,200
I wanna play with you.

495
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,034
You can kinda do two-player on it.

496
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:09,367
Bonnie and I are gonna listen to a book

497
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:11,125
and one of Natalie's suggestions.

498
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:12,044
It's not always that way.

499
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:13,785
You guys all have to go follow everyone,

500
00:18:13,785 --> 00:18:16,654
but especially Natalie's Instagram.

501
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:18,424
She is amazing.

502
00:18:18,424 --> 00:18:19,257
We've got The Ohana Adventure on Youtube--

503
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:20,987
I really like her.
You're so nice to me.

504
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:22,843
We've got Natalie Norton.
You're nice to me.

505
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:25,913
We've got Richie Norton, aka Ricky Bobby.

506
00:18:25,913 --> 00:18:27,406
Hello!

507
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:28,259
What up?

508
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:29,556
- [Jared] Ricky Bobby!

509
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:31,883
- [Bonnie] Ricky Bobby!

510
00:18:31,883 --> 00:18:34,104
And is your Instagram The Ohana Adventure?

511
00:18:34,104 --> 00:18:34,937
- [Jase] Yes.

512
00:18:34,937 --> 00:18:35,770
As well as Youtube.

513
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,215
There you go. You have it.

514
00:18:37,215 --> 00:18:38,994
Did you introduce me?

515
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:39,827
Oh, and this is Bonnie.

516
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:40,971
- [Jared] No, do you need an introduction?

517
00:18:40,971 --> 00:18:41,807
- [Bonnie] Yes!

518
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:43,070
We are sisters.

519
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,813
Some people don't know that.

520
00:18:44,813 --> 00:18:45,646
Every time.

521
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,611
My channel is Bonnie Hoellein.

522
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:48,444
Thank you.

523
00:18:48,444 --> 00:18:49,277
- [Jared] Such an angel.

524
00:18:49,277 --> 00:18:50,110
- [Bonnie] Jerk!

525
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,943
Look at our eyes.

526
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,710
Your eyes are so much bigger than mine.

527
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,078
When I smile, sometimes Jared goes,

528
00:18:56,078 --> 00:18:58,798
"Open your eyes up," and I
always get a little flustered,

529
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:00,079
'cause I'm like, "They are open".

530
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,700
They're open as I can get them.

531
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,469
I don't know.

532
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:09,315
My teeth are unproportionately
too large for my face.

533
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,898
(upbeat music)

534
00:19:19,008 --> 00:19:21,563
We're going to the mountains.

535
00:19:21,563 --> 00:19:24,146
(upbeat music)

536
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,937
After the beautiful
bullet ride that we took,

537
00:19:37,937 --> 00:19:39,621
it was a three and a half hour ride,

538
00:19:39,621 --> 00:19:40,898
we checked into our hotel.

539
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:41,734
Now, we're gonna go.

540
00:19:41,734 --> 00:19:42,567
(horn beeping)

541
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,067
Whoa! Hey!

542
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,397
I'm walking here.

543
00:19:45,397 --> 00:19:46,396
(horn beeping)
Hey!

544
00:19:46,396 --> 00:19:47,388
No! I'm serious.

545
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:48,221
Stop it.

546
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:50,272
Okay, that's enough.

547
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,262
Jeepers, you know.

548
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:53,095
(horn beeping)

549
00:19:53,095 --> 00:19:54,027
Hey, I'm serious!

550
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,451
What's the big deal?

551
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:59,727
We're going to this place
where we're gonna go fishing

552
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:02,397
with birds, using birds to fish.

553
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:03,230
Is that right?

554
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,173
That is correct.

555
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,529
How does it work?

556
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:06,407
I, well, actually, have no idea.

557
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:07,240
- [Ellie] Actually, the
bus driver's driving

558
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,633
with the door open.

559
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:09,685
Hey, we're gonna find out.

560
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,517
Ellie, have you ever
fished with birds before?

561
00:20:11,517 --> 00:20:12,941
No, I don't even know what we're doing.

562
00:20:12,941 --> 00:20:13,890
This is like the first I have--

563
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:14,723
- [Jared] Well, I'll tell
you what we're doing.

564
00:20:14,723 --> 00:20:16,127
We're fishing with birds.

565
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:19,050
That's what we're doing,
but how is the question.

566
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,108
How?

567
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:20,941
Ni hao.

568
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:21,942
Ni hao, that's how.

569
00:20:21,942 --> 00:20:24,192
(laughing)

570
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:29,373
That owner today was
so nice, so talkative.

571
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:30,206
He was probably really nice,

572
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,628
'cause we let him sit down first.

573
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:33,200
We were very respectful,
but he really was.

574
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,242
We followed cultural rules.

575
00:20:35,242 --> 00:20:36,193
Okay, here we go.

576
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,422
We're walking down.

577
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:39,329
K, everyone watch your step.

578
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:40,835
Be careful.

579
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,323
- [Joel] My shoelaces will light the way.

580
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:43,156
- [Jared] There you go.

581
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,756
Those glow in the, they do.

582
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:46,889
Oh my gosh, Ellie, come over here.

583
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:47,756
Look at this.

584
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:49,280
This is what we're using to fish.

585
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,126
Isn't this incredible?

586
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,805
What in the world?

587
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,138
(crosstalk)

588
00:20:58,451 --> 00:21:00,647
- [Ellie] They train these birds,

589
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:03,480
and they get fish for them to eat.

590
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:05,708
- [Offscreen Woman] It's heavy, right?

591
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,818
It's not really light.
Yeah, heavy on my arm.

592
00:21:07,818 --> 00:21:10,401
(gentle music)

593
00:21:14,437 --> 00:21:15,270
Those are the birds.

594
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,103
Those are the birds.

595
00:21:16,103 --> 00:21:16,967
Oh my gosh!

596
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:20,134
They're swimming underneath the water.

597
00:21:21,585 --> 00:21:24,301
- [Bonnie] No, those birds are fishing.

598
00:21:24,301 --> 00:21:25,255
- [Joel] He's got a fish in his beak.

599
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,494
He's trying to swim with it.

600
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,327
See him try to swallow it?

601
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:29,350
- [Jared] Yeah.

602
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,310
- [Joel] He can't get it down.

603
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,540
- [Jared] Now, he's bringing it.

604
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,373
Oh my gosh.

605
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:35,738
Oh, no way.

606
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:37,071
No freaking way.

607
00:21:37,925 --> 00:21:38,758
No freaking way.

608
00:21:38,758 --> 00:21:40,091
He's got a fish.

609
00:21:41,994 --> 00:21:42,827
Oh!

610
00:21:45,225 --> 00:21:46,058
Oh my gosh.

611
00:21:46,058 --> 00:21:46,891
- [Natalie] That's huge.

612
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:49,305
That's the size of him.

613
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:51,555
(cheering)

614
00:21:53,705 --> 00:21:54,583
- [Jared] They're holding their breath

615
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,416
and going underwater.

616
00:21:55,416 --> 00:21:57,079
That's so crazy to me.

617
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,246
- [Joel] Swimming upstream, look at him.

618
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:00,434
- [Jared] Both got 'em?

619
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:02,179
- [Joel] Look how big their necks are.

620
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:03,012
- [Jared] But they're gonna, yeah,

621
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:04,679
jump up on the boat.

622
00:22:06,761 --> 00:22:08,662
That's so crazy to me.

623
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,245
(gentle music)

624
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,757
After a long day's work, these
birds are just going to town.

625
00:22:18,757 --> 00:22:21,232
Look at them chowing down on their dinner.

626
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:23,248
- [Ellie] Sitting next to their master.

627
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:25,417
And they're just staying there.

628
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:27,014
Like, they're staying on the boat,

629
00:22:27,014 --> 00:22:30,000
because they're trained
to do that for these guys.

630
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,337
That is so cool.

631
00:22:31,337 --> 00:22:34,882
Those birds, it was incredible
the way that they did that,

632
00:22:34,882 --> 00:22:37,203
and these fishermen are with these birds

633
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:38,087
for such a long time.

634
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,664
Those fisherman, this is their living.

635
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:41,497
Livelihood.

636
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:42,555
Yeah, this is how they make money

637
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:46,363
is they take these birds
who are natural fishermen,

638
00:22:46,363 --> 00:22:48,505
fisher birds or something--
Fish birds.

639
00:22:48,505 --> 00:22:50,169
Fish birds, and they dive under the water,

640
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:52,220
and they grab these fish,
and those fishermen sell

641
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,152
the fish that these birds grab,
so this is their livelihood,

642
00:22:55,152 --> 00:22:58,225
and a way that they've improved on it

643
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:01,043
is that they show tourists
exactly what they do.

644
00:23:01,043 --> 00:23:03,466
Yeah, 'cause then we pay them, tip them--

645
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,409
Yeah, we tipped them and paid them

646
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:08,247
for us to follow them on
the boat and everything,

647
00:23:08,247 --> 00:23:10,900
and it's pretty cool to
see how they can take

648
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,596
this thing that they've
been doing for generations.

649
00:23:13,596 --> 00:23:16,617
They were saying this is their third time,

650
00:23:16,617 --> 00:23:18,620
third generation fishermen
doing this things

651
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,382
with these birds, and--

652
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:21,436
And they listen to him.

653
00:23:21,436 --> 00:23:22,453
He yelled at them.

654
00:23:22,453 --> 00:23:24,475
Yeah, it's incredible.

655
00:23:24,475 --> 00:23:25,308
It was like Penny.

656
00:23:25,308 --> 00:23:27,097
It's like, "Get over here! Come here".

657
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:27,930
Bring the fish.

658
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:28,798
Hop up up here.

659
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,121
Hey, is what they were saying.

660
00:23:31,121 --> 00:23:33,151
I just thought it was so cool.

661
00:23:33,151 --> 00:00:00,000
(gentle music)
