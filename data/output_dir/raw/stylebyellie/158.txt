1
00:00:00,151 --> 00:00:01,931
- [Jared] Oh my goodness.

2
00:00:01,931 --> 00:00:05,501
Hi Lumberjack, I mean Lumbercalvin.

3
00:00:05,501 --> 00:00:07,555
This is Jackson's old hat.

4
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,331
You guys may remember it from Halloween

5
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:10,841
one or two years ago,

6
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,497
but he wore it for his Lumberjack costume

7
00:00:12,497 --> 00:00:14,169
and now Calvin's wearing it.

8
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,640
And he just looks so stinking cute.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,205
- [Jackson] I'm gonna roll to you.

10
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:19,038
- [Jared] What?

11
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:19,871
You're gonna role to me?

12
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:20,704
- Yeah, watch

13
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:21,928
- [Jared] Okay, I'm watching.

14
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,673
Rollin' rollin' rollin'.

15
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:24,602
- I love this time of year

16
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:26,515
where I cook a lot more.

17
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:28,819
In the summer, I really
don't cook as much,

18
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:32,387
but I have really missed
eating one cinnamon roll a day,

19
00:00:32,387 --> 00:00:33,792
or two cinnamon rolls a day.

20
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,416
So I am getting ready to pour my yeast

21
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:39,082
into my flour,
- I'm playing with Play Doh.

22
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:39,915
- [Ellie] and you mister, you are,

23
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,616
you're playing with Play Doh.

24
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:45,170
So I'm making some
cinnamon rolls today guys.

25
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,592
So fun.

26
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,675
It's fall, it feels beautiful.

27
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,379
I can't wait to take Penny on a walk,

28
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,212
a family walk later.

29
00:00:51,212 --> 00:00:52,451
- I want to go on a walk too.

30
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:56,021
- [Ellie] You do, you
don't want to stay here?

31
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:56,854
- No.

32
00:00:56,854 --> 00:00:59,177
- Well fine, okay well
we will all go on a walk.

33
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:01,161
But I gotta get this ready, look at that.

34
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,084
You know you're gonna have
some good cinnamon rolls,

35
00:01:03,084 --> 00:01:03,917
when it looks like that.

36
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:04,991
While my bread is rising,

37
00:01:04,991 --> 00:01:06,615
I want to do a little story time.

38
00:01:06,615 --> 00:01:09,320
When I went into the
kitchen store the other day,

39
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,640
I was getting my friend a wedding present

40
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,744
and I ran into Bonnie and she was there.

41
00:01:13,744 --> 00:01:16,361
And that always makes me laugh when we run

42
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,640
into each other, because
I think people think

43
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,950
that we've never seen each other,

44
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,482
because we're like oh my gosh,

45
00:01:21,482 --> 00:01:23,218
so that was kind of funny.

46
00:01:23,218 --> 00:01:24,785
But I was picking up a hand mixer

47
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,970
because a few times ago,
while I was cooking,

48
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,637
my mixers had broke.

49
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,877
So I picked up a new one

50
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:36,427
and when I was there, I
wanted the KitchenAid one,

51
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:37,525
because that's what I've always had,

52
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:39,085
and I didn't know how
good a brand this was

53
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:41,243
and Bonnie said that she has the same one,

54
00:01:41,243 --> 00:01:43,254
and she loves it, and when I opened it,

55
00:01:43,254 --> 00:01:45,823
it had kneaders for bread.

56
00:01:45,823 --> 00:01:48,851
And so I've used those
and I really liked it.

57
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:50,201
And I was like this is awesome.

58
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:53,779
And then a few days later,
when I was in my pantry

59
00:01:53,779 --> 00:01:56,587
making toast, I told you guys

60
00:01:56,587 --> 00:01:59,259
how cool my toaster is,
it just is really cool,

61
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,850
like you put the toast in
and it slowly goes down

62
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,690
and it just seems like
a really cool toaster.

63
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:07,498
And it's the same brand,

64
00:02:07,498 --> 00:02:10,026
then I just thought oh, I really like that

65
00:02:10,026 --> 00:02:12,194
and so far, I really like these mixers,

66
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:15,770
so I think I scored by getting this.

67
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,023
But when we first moved into the house,

68
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:21,106
I bought like a big KitchenAid mixer,

69
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,171
and it had a shortage,

70
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,180
like it worked for one
time and it didn't work.

71
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,209
So when I went to take it back,

72
00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:32,616
I ended up returning it and
not getting another one.

73
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:34,767
And I do like not having one,

74
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,562
I like that this is just small.

75
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:41,137
And I even have my kneading
mixers with that too, so,

76
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:42,230
kinda funny.

77
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,239
- I want to get braces.

78
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:44,494
- [Ellie] You want to get braces?

79
00:02:44,494 --> 00:02:45,327
- Yeah.

80
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:47,544
- [Ellie] Show me how it works.

81
00:02:47,544 --> 00:02:51,027
Oh, on your Play Doh,
show me how it works.

82
00:02:51,027 --> 00:02:52,255
Cool.

83
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,447
You want to mix it?

84
00:02:53,447 --> 00:02:54,280
- Yeah.

85
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,409
- [Ellie] Okay, hold this.

86
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:57,242
Hold this.

87
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:58,491
(mixer whirring)

88
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,658
Go all around.

89
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,722
Alright, three hours later and I am now

90
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:07,954
ready for the day.

91
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:10,043
And my bread has risen.

92
00:03:10,043 --> 00:03:11,211
Doesn't it look awesome?

93
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:12,579
I tweeted you guys the other day

94
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:15,978
and I said, show me your spice cabinet,

95
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,370
because I was really interested

96
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,517
how everybody organized theirs.

97
00:03:19,517 --> 00:03:21,109
Because something that
I've had a hard time

98
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:21,974
with since we've moved,

99
00:03:21,974 --> 00:03:24,614
is trying to figure out how things work,

100
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,622
and I finally think I figured it out.

101
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:29,109
This is like the cookie
cutter and sprinkles,

102
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:31,429
because we don't really
get into that very much.

103
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:34,982
Pie plates and then a lot of
my kitchen stuff right here.

104
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,431
My spices used to be right here,

105
00:03:36,431 --> 00:03:38,739
but it was really packed and stuff.

106
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:41,095
And a lot of you guys
had yours in drawers.

107
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,236
So I moved all my spices into the drawer

108
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,053
and I really liked it a lot better

109
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:46,859
so thanks for tweeting
me your guys' pictures

110
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,077
the other day.

111
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:49,969
But I am going to roll these out

112
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,804
and make some cinnamon rolls.

113
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,887
(chill guitar music)

114
00:04:00,763 --> 00:04:01,841
That is a wrap.

115
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,643
I am done in the kitchen today.

116
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,542
When you're cooking bread in the kitchen,

117
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,375
it's all day in the kitchen,

118
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,744
you gotta wipe up the kitchen.

119
00:04:08,744 --> 00:04:10,054
And entertain the kids.

120
00:04:10,054 --> 00:04:11,453
They've watched some TV and they've played

121
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:13,893
outside a lot, so I think they're okay.

122
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:14,726
I think they're happy.

123
00:04:14,726 --> 00:04:17,793
But bread is done,
cinnamon rolls are done.

124
00:04:17,793 --> 00:04:18,746
I texted my mom and I said
when I make the cinnamon rolls,

125
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:22,345
I can't help but make them humongo.

126
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,650
I don't know how to not make them huge.

127
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,554
But I guess that's okay too, right?

128
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:29,434
Calvin is playing a trick on me.

129
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:30,495
Stop!

130
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:31,634
Every time I turn

131
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:35,211
okay, every time I turn it
on to rinse the sink out,

132
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:38,794
he pushes it to start
it and stop it again.

133
00:04:39,903 --> 00:04:40,986
Jokes on you.

134
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,551
Can't turn it on.

135
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,968
Can't turn it on.

136
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,205
Stinker.

137
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:51,926
- Okay we need to spice
things up a little bit.

138
00:04:51,926 --> 00:04:52,759
Alright?

139
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,187
Ellie has been in the kitchen all day,

140
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:57,131
making some delicious
cinnamon rolls and bread

141
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:57,964
and it's been amazing.

142
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,035
The kids have been playing,

143
00:04:59,035 --> 00:05:00,627
having a great time,

144
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:02,034
but I think they need to spice things

145
00:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,251
up a little bit.

146
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:05,339
I've had something in my
trunk for quite some time

147
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,548
and I think it's about time I pull it out

148
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:10,122
and well, you'll see.

149
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:12,146
What the kids don't know,

150
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,135
oh they'll soon know.

151
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,939
So like I said, I've
had these in the trunk

152
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,067
for quite some time, just
waiting for the right moment

153
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,258
to pull them out,

154
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:19,922
and I think now's the perfect time.

155
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:21,714
Are you ready to see this?

156
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:23,905
Um, cue the epic entry moment.

157
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:26,655
(dramatic music)

158
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,977
It's time for a Nerf war.

159
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:30,311
The kids have no idea.

160
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:32,087
Ellie knows and I'm gonna call her up here

161
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,874
in just a second and have some help,

162
00:05:33,874 --> 00:05:35,498
and we're gonna surprise the boys.

163
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:37,259
But it might not be a
surprise that you're thinking

164
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,691
that we're giving them.

165
00:05:38,691 --> 00:05:40,306
It's the other kind of surprise.

166
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:43,240
And just in case we run out of ammo,

167
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,087
I've got plenty more.

168
00:05:44,087 --> 00:05:44,920
(laughs)

169
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,635
Am I bad, or is this
just hilarious and fun?

170
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,146
We're about to find out, I don't know.

171
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:51,650
I'm excited, this is gonna be great.

172
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,082
Hey Ellie, can you come
upstairs and help me

173
00:05:53,082 --> 00:05:54,974
for a minute?

174
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:56,870
(lively music)

175
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,787
Are you ready for this?

176
00:06:02,065 --> 00:06:02,898
Hide it.

177
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,373
- Raaa!

178
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:11,477
Oh no.

179
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,725
They're so excited.

180
00:06:13,725 --> 00:06:14,725
Oh no, fire.

181
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:18,894
It's not working.

182
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,022
- [Ellie] It doesn't work!

183
00:06:20,022 --> 00:06:22,022
- [Jared] What happened?

184
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,625
- Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry.

185
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,112
Let's get Daddy, let's get Daddy.

186
00:06:40,112 --> 00:06:41,557
Waa, you did it!

187
00:06:41,557 --> 00:06:43,724
Get him, get him, get him!

188
00:06:58,605 --> 00:06:59,438
You won!

189
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:07,421
Good job.

190
00:07:08,272 --> 00:07:09,689
- Na na na na na.

191
00:07:10,753 --> 00:07:11,793
- Is that fun?

192
00:07:11,793 --> 00:07:12,626
- Yeah.

193
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:14,599
- Here Calvin, here let me help ya.

194
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:15,432
- Oh that was funny.

195
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:17,982
My brother Beau had a yellow Nerf gun

196
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:21,232
and that thing lasted for years, years.

197
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:23,882
Okay let's see it.

198
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:27,370
(yelling)

199
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,513
Launch it back, launch
it back, hold it tight.

200
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,662
- Mission mission is a go, ready?

201
00:07:31,662 --> 00:07:32,829
One two three.

202
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:36,349
(slow motion)

203
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:43,535
(laughing)

204
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:45,976
I hit the camera.

205
00:07:45,976 --> 00:07:48,473
- You want to try it?

206
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,306
Whoa!

207
00:07:51,454 --> 00:07:52,287
- Hoo Ha!

208
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:54,490
Ha!

209
00:08:00,072 --> 00:08:01,155
- [Ellie] No!

210
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:05,022
- [Jared] You're surrounded.

211
00:08:05,865 --> 00:08:08,198
Grab your blaster, let's go.

212
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:10,061
Go go go!

213
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:12,360
Oh no.

214
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,680
- Your blaster, let me see it.

215
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,543
- [Jared] Blast Captain America's shield.

216
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:18,005
Nice.

217
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:19,612
Did you have fun with your blasters?

218
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:21,466
Okay, Daddy's gonna put 'em away, alright?

219
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,992
Can you say thanks Dad?

220
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:25,088
- Thanks Dad.
(Calvin singing)

221
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,490
- You're such a good musician.

222
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,644
You know that?

223
00:08:27,644 --> 00:08:29,310
Seriously though, Calvin,

224
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,034
I think Calvin is gonna
have a musical talent.

225
00:08:32,034 --> 00:08:33,325
Oh thanks for that blaster.

226
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:35,950
I think really Calvin is gonna have

227
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,606
a really great musical talent.

228
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,390
I forgot more blasters,
okay let's grab 'em.

229
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,327
Just between you and me guys,

230
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:42,639
these blasters are for me.

231
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,278
They're my toys.

232
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:46,065
The kids aren't even strong
enough to pull 'em back.

233
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:47,674
Besides I'm probably
going to be the only one

234
00:08:47,674 --> 00:08:49,826
who's using it, mostly
to do things like this.

235
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,732
(Nerf shot)

236
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,195
- First a screech, then a growl

237
00:08:53,195 --> 00:08:55,112
and a howl at the moon.

238
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:59,244
Next up zombie truck.

239
00:08:59,244 --> 00:09:03,302
Headlights full of green dripping diesel.

240
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:05,135
He's cranky and green.

241
00:09:07,303 --> 00:09:08,290
Then out of the shadows,

242
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,124
ghost truck appears.
- Truck.

243
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,610
Rattling his axles and grinding his gears.

244
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,548
- More trucks.

245
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:15,271
- More trucks.
- Are those more trucks?

246
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:18,845
- Vampire truck is toothsome cruel.

247
00:09:18,845 --> 00:09:22,207
He waits for his victims
and drinks down their fuel.

248
00:09:22,207 --> 00:09:23,953
Do you know who gave us this book?

249
00:09:23,953 --> 00:09:24,786
- Yeah.

250
00:09:24,786 --> 00:09:27,002
- All of our IVF couples last year,

251
00:09:27,002 --> 00:09:29,597
they all chipped in and
bought us some stuff.

252
00:09:29,597 --> 00:09:31,792
And that was so nice of them to give,

253
00:09:31,792 --> 00:09:33,008
that's like a fun book.

254
00:09:33,008 --> 00:09:33,841
That's the first time I've read it.

255
00:09:33,841 --> 00:09:34,988
- Oh it's like my favorite book

256
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:36,325
to read to the kids, I love it.

257
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,021
It's fun because it's Halloween.

258
00:09:38,021 --> 00:09:40,629
And Calvin loves trucks.

259
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:42,046
So I didn't tell you this,

260
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,255
so I went to the four-wheeler store today,

261
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,655
because we've got a fun
trip coming up this weekend

262
00:09:46,655 --> 00:09:48,935
and I took Calvin with me.

263
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:52,405
We went into the store and he went crazy.

264
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:55,421
He went crazy, he was
like vroom vroom, vroom,

265
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:57,731
vroom vroom, truck.

266
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,580
It was the funniest thing,

267
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,838
like literally that
cadence, he saw every truck.

268
00:10:02,838 --> 00:10:04,021
Do you remember

269
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,914
going to the trucks?
- When they're old enough,

270
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:09,460
- they will for sure
ride four-wheelers, huh?

271
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:11,844
- [Jared] Oh, you think
you're gonna sleep here again?

272
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:12,770
That didn't last very long last night.

273
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,943
- [Ellie] No it didn't,
that was the worst.

274
00:10:14,943 --> 00:10:16,626
- [Jared] Don't get comfy,

275
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,894
you're going into your own bed young man.

276
00:10:17,894 --> 00:10:21,054
You're going into your own bed young man.

277
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:23,564
- [Ellie] Hey Calvin, do
you sleep in your bed?

278
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:25,121
Calvin, do you sleep in your bed?

279
00:10:25,121 --> 00:10:25,954
- Yeah.

280
00:10:25,954 --> 00:10:28,944
- [Ellie] Okay, you sleep in your bed.

281
00:10:28,944 --> 00:10:30,881
Who's is this bed?

282
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:31,714
Who's bed?

283
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:33,452
- Bed.

284
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:35,127
- Jackson's.

285
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:36,187
My bed.

286
00:10:36,187 --> 00:10:38,814
- [Ellie] This is not your
bed, yours is upstairs.

287
00:10:38,814 --> 00:10:41,607
- Mom look, the witch.
- No.

288
00:10:41,607 --> 00:10:43,369
- Witch witch, I want to do this one.

289
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:46,936
- Okay last one and then it's bed time.

290
00:10:46,936 --> 00:10:47,769
- The kids are in bed,

291
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:49,217
I just sent Ellie a text message.

292
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:51,454
And I'm gonna see if she has read it.

293
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:52,287
- Calvin's coughing.

294
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,120
- Oh we should be quiet.

295
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,584
- He just said let's meet
in the kitchen and make out.

296
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:57,455
- [Jared] You're here.

297
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:01,331
- And I feel like I'm in
a good mood right now,

298
00:11:01,331 --> 00:11:03,418
not to make out.

299
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:04,647
Okay, I'll make out with you before I go.

300
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:06,122
Someone tweeted me to ask
if I would do the recipe

301
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,658
of my stuffed bell pepper
from last year that I showed.

302
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:10,818
It's really easy and simple

303
00:11:10,818 --> 00:11:12,809
and I'm gonna film that tonight.

304
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:14,557
And then soon, I'm gonna film the one

305
00:11:14,557 --> 00:11:16,481
that I made on Sunday, the quinoa one,

306
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:18,708
which is phenomenal.

307
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:20,868
So I gotta go, bye.

308
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:21,701
- You have to make out with me first,

309
00:11:21,701 --> 00:11:25,550
before you go to the grocery store, okay?

310
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,383
Oh you want me to end it?

311
00:11:26,383 --> 00:11:29,325
Alright guys that is
the vlog from us to you.

312
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:32,612
After the kids went to bed,
I made these for my channel.

313
00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:33,740
We have a recipe down below

314
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,377
for the rolls and cinnamon rolls.

315
00:11:35,377 --> 00:11:37,701
And then tomorrow you can
go to my channel for this.

316
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:39,528
I've had a good day in the kitchen.

317
00:11:39,528 --> 00:11:41,708
I feel like it's just taken my mind,

318
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:43,199
just I haven't even thought.

319
00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:45,779
I've just cooked and then
I've catered to the kids,

320
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,754
it's just been a really restful day,

321
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:50,006
even though I've been
in the kitchen working,

322
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,422
if that makes sense, just mentally.

323
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:53,538
I've really enjoyed it.

324
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:54,891
And tomorrow I can't wait to stuff my face

325
00:11:54,891 --> 00:11:55,724
with cinnamon rolls,

326
00:11:55,724 --> 00:11:57,884
so that's a plus, so.

327
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,445
Thank you so much Kaytlynn,

328
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:01,322
especially for watching the vlog today,

329
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:03,498
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

330
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:04,599
Bye.

331
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,556
And Penny's right here waiting for me

332
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:06,973
to give her food.

333
00:12:07,907 --> 00:12:10,136
- [Jared] You are such a good girl Penny.

334
00:12:10,136 --> 00:12:12,328
She is, like look at
her, with all this food

335
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:15,153
on these tables, she is just sitting there

336
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:16,702
like a good doggo.

337
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,224
- You know when my mom
and dad got our dog,

338
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:21,680
when she was seven months old, I think,

339
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,513
or she was probably a year old,

340
00:12:22,513 --> 00:12:25,478
my mom made loaves of bread.

341
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,641
They had left somewhere,

342
00:12:26,641 --> 00:12:29,534
and the dog had gotten up and eaten

343
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,406
all of the loaves of bread

344
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:34,409
and then crapped all over the house.

345
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:35,367
(laughs)

346
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:38,640
- It wouldn't be an Ellie
and Jared vlog without poop.

347
00:12:38,640 --> 00:00:00,000
- See ya.
- Bye.
