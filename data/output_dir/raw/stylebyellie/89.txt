1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,669
- Everybody say cheese!

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,227
- [Both] Cheese!

3
00:00:04,227 --> 00:00:05,820
- Who's ready for the Christmas?

4
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,642
Christmas party!

5
00:00:07,642 --> 00:00:09,732
(cheering)

6
00:00:09,732 --> 00:00:12,982
(upbeat festive music)

7
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:16,939
(laughter)

8
00:00:32,823 --> 00:00:34,323
- Merry Christmas!

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,284
- You got your cookies for Santa.

10
00:00:38,284 --> 00:00:40,087
I got my cookies for Santa.

11
00:00:40,087 --> 00:00:42,435
I have a huge headache and I just took

12
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:45,404
medicine that probably will not help.

13
00:00:45,404 --> 00:00:47,950
Let's start this
Christmas party off right!

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,991
- Let's get the Griswold family

15
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:53,309
Christmas party special started!

16
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:55,948
- What does Griswold say with his...

17
00:00:55,948 --> 00:00:57,014
Eggnog?

18
00:00:57,014 --> 00:00:58,737
Where is the dang Tylenol!

19
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,545
Something like that, I
need to find that clip.

20
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:01,430
- Where's the Tylenol?

21
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,062
- We all need that.

22
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:04,072
Who needs some Tylenol?

23
00:01:04,072 --> 00:01:05,702
Let's go!

24
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:06,535
- Catch!

25
00:01:08,437 --> 00:01:09,556
There you go!

26
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:10,799
- Did that hurt you?

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,632
- No.

28
00:01:11,632 --> 00:01:12,768
Did you hear him?

29
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,268
Did that hurt you?

30
00:01:17,378 --> 00:01:19,757
- We have a full day of activities planned

31
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:21,969
for this holiday Christmas party

32
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,978
and it's all thanks to Landon and Julie

33
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:26,340
in charge of the
Christmas party this year.

34
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,839
And the first activity that we're doing,

35
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:28,685
oh, I dropped my shirt.

36
00:01:28,685 --> 00:01:32,269
Sorry, car's waiting for
me, sorry about that.

37
00:01:32,269 --> 00:01:33,557
The first activity that we're doing,

38
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,508
is we're going to a place called, Dartside

39
00:01:35,508 --> 00:01:38,091
and we're having Nerf gun wars!

40
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,446
I'm really excited about
this, I even brought clothes

41
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:44,872
to change into because
it's gonna get intense.

42
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:48,122
(upbeat festive music)

43
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:05,431
Merry Christmas everyone!

44
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:07,155
Are you guys ready for this?

45
00:02:07,155 --> 00:02:08,860
You ready to be taken down?

46
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,058
Are you ready to lose?

47
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:12,194
You ready to go up against the champ?

48
00:02:12,194 --> 00:02:13,435
Number one!

49
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:14,440
Ugly?

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,919
Mom, there is nothing ugly about this.

51
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:20,804
You gotta put gear on,
just maternity pants?

52
00:02:20,804 --> 00:02:22,272
There you go.

53
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,567
- Hey, I'm wearing the same ones.

54
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:24,446
- Maternity pants?

55
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,279
Alright.

56
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,559
- The plan we're going in,
doesn't count as two person

57
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:28,392
so it's like...

58
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:29,225
- Two points.

59
00:02:29,225 --> 00:02:30,803
- Two on two, yeah, and if you hit them,

60
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:32,071
you get two points, if I hit you.

61
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:32,904
- Us verse her.

62
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,605
- Two people versus.

63
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:36,601
- Two people, really.

64
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,419
But you guys she only has one gun,

65
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:42,651
so you only get one gun,
you have to share it.

66
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:45,263
- Everybody's getting
their teams figured out.

67
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:49,085
This guy, everyone is laughing at him,

68
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:51,543
it's like, what toddler just like,

69
00:02:51,543 --> 00:02:54,264
lays on the table and just sleeps?

70
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:55,263
Calvin does!

71
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:59,343
He's sleeping so I gotta
sit here and be with Calvin

72
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:00,586
while everybody shoots.

73
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:03,238
- It is time to divide up the teams,

74
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:05,817
it's orange versus yellow!

75
00:03:05,817 --> 00:03:10,441
Uh oh, Jackson, looks like
we're on the opposite teams.

76
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,274
What team are you on?

77
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:12,730
Say yeah!

78
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,246
- Yeah!

79
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:15,830
- You guys all have pockets on your vests?

80
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,642
What I want you to do is I
want you to show your neighbor

81
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:19,579
how to close the gun the right way.

82
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,285
- These kids have never listened

83
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:23,952
to something so intently before.

84
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:28,383
They're like, I'm ready for this.

85
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:31,162
I've waited my whole life for this moment!

86
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:32,892
Here you go, bud.

87
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:37,630
Hey, let's remember, yeah,
pull that back, pull it back.

88
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,092
And then we put a dart
in, push the button,

89
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:40,925
good job!

90
00:03:43,956 --> 00:03:46,412
Hey Jackson, this is
where we part ways, okay?

91
00:03:46,412 --> 00:03:48,739
So we'll meet in the
middle and we'll attack!

92
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:49,744
You ready?

93
00:03:49,744 --> 00:03:51,344
- Where's my bullet?

94
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:52,442
- They're all over there on the ground,

95
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:53,872
so you grab one and put it inside, okay?

96
00:03:53,872 --> 00:03:55,784
- Alright yellow team, here's the deal,

97
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:58,014
it's team elimination, that means

98
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:00,430
if you get shot, you're
out, so the goal is,

99
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,229
to shoot as many people as you can

100
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:04,110
without getting shot, can you do that?

101
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,554
- [All] Yeah!

102
00:04:05,554 --> 00:04:07,678
- That's what I'm talking
about, yellow team for the win!

103
00:04:07,678 --> 00:04:08,650
You ready, Bonas?

104
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,619
- Oh, we're gonna do it.

105
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:11,520
- Uncle Jerry, you get Chad.

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,020
- I will get Chad.

107
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:15,428
- Yellow team, you ready?

108
00:04:15,428 --> 00:04:16,697
- Yeah!

109
00:04:16,697 --> 00:04:17,964
- Here we go, three...

110
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:18,881
- Two, one!

111
00:04:19,838 --> 00:04:20,671
Let's go!

112
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,373
(upbeat music)

113
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,622
Jackson almost got me!

114
00:04:36,525 --> 00:04:39,200
(upbeat music)

115
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,033
ah, Cody!

116
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:42,198
Cody got my bum!

117
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,865
Cody got my bum, no!

118
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:49,079
Alright guys, it's up to
you, you're our last hope.

119
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:52,823
- Oh, yeah!

120
00:04:55,831 --> 00:04:56,748
Hi Jackson!

121
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,532
Get him.

122
00:05:01,532 --> 00:05:02,365
Nice shot!

123
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,953
(cheering)

124
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:10,936
Olivia, we're on the same team!

125
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:13,519
(upbeat music)

126
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:26,166
Olivia got me, with the
battle wound and everything.

127
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:28,853
Guys, I'm out!

128
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:30,922
I'm out!

129
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:39,752
- Jared, I see you.

130
00:05:39,752 --> 00:05:41,562
Bows, who do you want on your team?

131
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:44,229
Around needs a Bo on their team.

132
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:48,527
He's the only one working over there.

133
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:51,110
(upbeat music)

134
00:06:14,052 --> 00:06:16,219
He's a sneaky, sneaky guy.

135
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,164
Did you just wake up?

136
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:36,752
The worker was like, staring at him

137
00:06:36,752 --> 00:06:39,288
and Calvin was like, staring at him.

138
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:41,788
- Staring contest, you and me.

139
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:47,060
(intense music)

140
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:57,586
(lively music)

141
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:20,003
reloading...

142
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,821
I think they're shooting because they're

143
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:24,488
ganging up on the like, referee.

144
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,410
This is the coolest!

145
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:29,912
Hi!

146
00:08:29,912 --> 00:08:32,693
Oh my gosh, well,
everybody played together,

147
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:33,920
now the adults are playing.

148
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:34,754
What!

149
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,977
This is another area
for the kids to play at.

150
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,810
So fun!

151
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:44,001
Did you just wake up, mister?

152
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,084
Good morning!

153
00:08:46,356 --> 00:08:48,648
- Good luck, cause some
trouble, have some fun.

154
00:08:48,648 --> 00:08:50,981
- Jackson, did you have fun?

155
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:06,301
How cute is that!

156
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,437
Get up there, get up there.

157
00:09:20,427 --> 00:09:22,587
What did you think of that game?

158
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:23,510
- Good.

159
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,515
- Did you like it?

160
00:09:24,515 --> 00:09:25,517
- Yeah.

161
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:26,599
- Did you play with your cousins?

162
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,432
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:29,387
- He's like, too busy, he wants to play.

164
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:32,554
Aw, did you see that all these bodies.

165
00:09:34,857 --> 00:09:35,803
What!

166
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:37,470
That is the coolest!

167
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:40,673
I'm watching, wow!

168
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,332
That is cool!

169
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,750
Do you like that choo choo train?

170
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,050
That's right up Henry's alley.

171
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,362
Should we go get our shoes on?

172
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:01,527
And go to grandma's house?

173
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:02,936
You know you filmed something good

174
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,722
when you have to sit down and replay

175
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:07,305
it for the whole family to see.

176
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:18,078
I was like, that's out of a movie.

177
00:10:19,564 --> 00:10:21,814
(laughter)

178
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,838
washing our hands so no one
gets horrible tummy upsets.

179
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,375
- Yeah, everyone's in line
washing hands before we eat, huh?

180
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,972
- Cookies for Santa, me.

181
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:46,224
- Cookies for Santa, no!

182
00:10:46,224 --> 00:10:47,397
Cookies for me!

183
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,011
- At first, when you like get together

184
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:50,229
and everyone's like good
and then you go home like,

185
00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:51,562
everyone's sick.

186
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:55,117
I'm like, please don't get sick.

187
00:10:55,117 --> 00:10:57,119
- Everyone wash your hands so we

188
00:10:57,119 --> 00:10:58,678
can have a really enjoyable time, okay?

189
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,664
Has anyone seen Calvin?

190
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:03,367
Calvin, where are you, bud?

191
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,950
Have you guys seen
Calvin, is he over here?

192
00:11:08,662 --> 00:11:09,953
Disappeared...

193
00:11:09,953 --> 00:11:12,803
Huh, I wonder where Calvin is?

194
00:11:12,803 --> 00:11:16,675
He might be getting his hands washed.

195
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,883
Ellie, is Calvin over there?

196
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:18,972
- No!

197
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:20,249
- He's not?

198
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:21,082
Huh...

199
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,389
Calvin might be outside,
I'm not sure where he is.

200
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,556
There you are!

201
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,607
Hiding under the table.

202
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:32,940
Yeah, silly boy.

203
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,749
- These kids are not eating, they

204
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,451
just wanna stay by the presents.

205
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:46,015
Don't open them, okay?

206
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,060
- Okay.

207
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,368
- Don't open them yet.

208
00:11:48,368 --> 00:11:49,947
- Oh no, oh no.

209
00:11:49,947 --> 00:11:51,674
Dog pile on Chad.

210
00:11:51,674 --> 00:11:53,424
Oh, and it's crashed.

211
00:11:56,095 --> 00:11:59,220
- Julia's in charge of the
family Christmas party this year

212
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,100
and either everyone's
gonna love it or hate it.

213
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,431
- I think people are annoyed with us.

214
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:06,957
We have to like, put together a skit?

215
00:12:06,957 --> 00:12:09,369
- I think everyone's wishes
are a little overwhelmed

216
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:11,734
just with Christmas but
I think it's really fun.

217
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:16,015
Some of us are going to be
doing a lip sync battle.

218
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,686
All the kids are gonna
watch and either be scarred,

219
00:12:18,686 --> 00:12:20,360
scared or...

220
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,944
Crap their pants, I don't know.

221
00:12:21,944 --> 00:12:24,122
Grandma and grandpa are going first.

222
00:12:24,122 --> 00:12:25,368
Ours is pretty good.

223
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:26,833
- Ours is pretty dang good, guys.

224
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,191
- We have costumes, do
you guys have costumes?

225
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:30,274
- [All] Yeah!

226
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:36,033
- I have a costume, it's an Elsa dress!

227
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,038
- Ooh!

228
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:38,038
That's cool!

229
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:44,831
- Oh no!

230
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,091
- That's the wrong one too.

231
00:12:51,091 --> 00:12:52,752
- Hey, everybody!

232
00:12:52,752 --> 00:12:53,585

00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,235

Jackson.

269
00:15:17,628 --> 00:15:20,269
That says, what does that say?

270
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:21,269
- Jackson!

271
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:22,102
- Jackson!

272
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:25,968
- What'd you get, bud?

273
00:15:25,968 --> 00:15:27,835
- Jackson, what do you say?

00:15:27,835 --> 00:15:28,668
No!

275
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,254
- Ooh, small boxes!

276
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:46,455
(screeching)

277
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:49,220
- We have a box like this for grandma.

278
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,053
- Mom!

279
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:54,057
- That's so sweet...

280
00:15:54,057 --> 00:15:57,224
- Really, I'm dying, I kinda want one.

281
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,216
- Is there anything on the inside?

282
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:03,716
- That is so cute!

283
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,956
- What's in it?

284
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:08,048
- Aw...

285
00:16:08,048 --> 00:16:09,531
It's a picture of mum and dad.

286
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:10,729
- Yes...

287
00:16:10,729 --> 00:16:11,948
- And we can put ours right there.

288
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:12,949
- Yes.

289
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:13,952
- For the kids or something.

290
00:16:13,952 --> 00:16:15,119
- I love this!

291
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:18,588
- When the little girls
opened up their lockets,

292
00:16:18,588 --> 00:16:20,633
Ellie was like, I want one of those.

293
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:21,619
I seriously want.

294
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:24,702
- She was referring to a little girl.

295
00:16:26,554 --> 00:16:29,542
- Emily, what's yours like?

296
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:30,375
Cute!

297
00:16:31,255 --> 00:16:32,979
- That's awesome.

298
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:35,806
- What's your knife look like?

299
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:36,769
- Like this.

300
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:38,769
- Cute, Landon, aw yeah!

301
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:41,368
Yeah!

302
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,201
Cute!

303
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,142
- Thank you mom and dad!

304
00:16:44,142 --> 00:16:45,107
- Welcome.

305
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:48,059
- I like the chain, look
how thick that chain is.

306
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,196
- Yeah, I mean, the steel
on this, is just so pretty.

307
00:16:52,196 --> 00:16:53,670
- Yeah, think about it for a minute.

308
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,339
- That's a big shelf.

309
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:57,922
- A lot of pictures to hang up.

310
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,224
- So is there 20 frames here?

311
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:03,641
- There is 21, but I need to go grab one.

312
00:17:04,803 --> 00:17:06,182
A few more, to have just in case.

313
00:17:06,182 --> 00:17:09,349
- It's a picture of all the grandkids.

314
00:17:11,017 --> 00:17:11,850
Yay!

315
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,676
- We're out of the game though.

316
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,676
- They all look so good!

317
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:19,011
- Mommy!

318
00:17:19,011 --> 00:17:21,094
- Yes, you look so smart.

319
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:26,131
- I think you look handsome, Boston.

320
00:17:26,131 --> 00:17:28,709
So this is something that
Landon has been doing

321
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:30,461
to help Ellie's headaches.

322
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:33,323
Basically just taking her neck

323
00:17:33,323 --> 00:17:36,240
and throwing it all over the place.

324
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:41,166
- When she starts twitching, it's normal.

325
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:45,333
- Any loud screams is normal
too, apparently, right?

326
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:52,520
Nice.

327
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,781
I heard that.

328
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,872
Ouch.

329
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:08,798
Oh yeah, I gotta find the outside.

330
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:18,201
- The last three times
Landon has done this,

331
00:18:18,201 --> 00:18:21,245
my headache is instantly gone away

332
00:18:21,245 --> 00:18:26,209
but I instantly feel sick so,
it releases all that crap.

333
00:18:26,209 --> 00:18:27,871
- But the headache being gone, is so nice.

334
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,302
- I'm gonna get a hold
of a chiropractor and...

335
00:18:31,302 --> 00:18:33,885
I have them see me once a week.

336
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,265
- No big deal, just grabbing
a hold of the shoulder blade.

337
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,655
- Yeah, I don't blame you.

338
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,464
This is more for my rock
climbing figures side of things.

339
00:18:44,464 --> 00:18:45,783
- This is one of my favorite parts

340
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:48,062
but most stressful parts
about getting together

341
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,576
for the holidays is making sure

342
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:52,781
all of these kids are
situated and fed and everyone

343
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:55,022
is doing a good job at eating,

344
00:18:55,022 --> 00:18:56,667
not making any, too many messes.

345
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,448
We've got some delicious food,

346
00:18:58,448 --> 00:19:00,771
Julie made this raspberry pretzel

347
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:03,072
cream thing that looks delicious.

348
00:19:03,072 --> 00:19:04,762
- It's going fast, the
adults better get in.

349
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:08,113
- We've got some pumpkin pie
and then we're gonna have

350
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,284
some root beer floats, we got some like,

351
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:11,821
candy and all that good stuff.

352
00:19:11,821 --> 00:19:13,919
And this entire evening, we've been having

353
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,002
the wonderful music of Kevin himself.

354
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,382
Tickle those ivories, man.

355
00:19:28,193 --> 00:19:30,376
- I am not gonna let a week go by

356
00:19:30,376 --> 00:19:31,967
without me calling Landon in.

357
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,863
- Okay, yeah.

358
00:19:32,863 --> 00:19:34,835
- Cause every time I see Landon, I do that

359
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,456
and it does feel so good and I know

360
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,096
that's what I need to do, it's like,

361
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:40,882
go to a chiropractor, do
acupuncture, something.

362
00:19:40,882 --> 00:19:41,821
- You know what I need to do?

363
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:42,654
- What?

364
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:44,480
- I need you to give me
a bite of your desert.

365
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,613
- Okay, I'm feeling my neck right now.

366
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:48,359
There's just a spot that's just

367
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,699
always more tight and tender, it hurts

368
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,306
so bad, so, thank you Landon.

369
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,917
- He's a miracle worker.

370
00:19:55,917 --> 00:19:58,846
- But it's amazing how like,
sick you get right away

371
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:01,248
when it's done cause it
just releases everything

372
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:03,024
and you're just like...

373
00:20:03,024 --> 00:20:04,935
Okay, here you go, I just gave you

374
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:08,018
a little bite cause I really like it.

375
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:13,694
Aw!

376
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:16,329
(laughter)

377
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:17,693
look at his face.

378
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,660
- Okay, here we go.

379
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,010
- After Kate's turn, it's my turn!

380
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:25,137
- Oh my gosh, put it in there, Kate.

381
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:26,470
Get it in there!

382
00:20:27,484 --> 00:20:30,067
- After her turn, it's my turn!

383
00:20:34,562 --> 00:20:36,318
- That's cute.

384
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,985
Cal's putting his hand in there.

385
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:44,301
- He's like, I want to make
peace by shaking her hand.

386
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:46,557
(laughter)

387
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,057
you see him shake?

388
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,613
Yeah, Calvin go!

389
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,273
Aw...

390
00:21:02,993 --> 00:21:06,538
- No one's ever been able to beat mom

391
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:08,871
in an arm wrestle, even dad.

392
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,032
- I think Bo's gonna win cause

393
00:21:14,032 --> 00:21:18,199
he has this hidden strength
that just comes out of nowhere.

394
00:21:21,962 --> 00:21:25,045
- Champion stays and then Jared goes.

395
00:21:27,726 --> 00:21:31,099
- And we work our way in,
so I will be the final one.

396
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,266
- Get set, go!

397
00:21:34,892 --> 00:21:35,725
Oh...

398
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,591
Wow!

399
00:21:45,188 --> 00:21:47,771
- Ah, she's putting up a fight!

400
00:21:53,128 --> 00:21:54,693
- Mom's coaching him.

401
00:21:54,693 --> 00:21:56,003
- And look at your
fingernails, they're filthy,

402
00:21:56,003 --> 00:21:59,058
when's the last time you
changed your underwear?

403
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:00,308
- Okay, you go.

404
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:02,348
You go!

405
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:11,887
- Mom is the odds.

406
00:22:19,493 --> 00:22:21,826
- Slam it down, Bo, come on.

407
00:22:26,341 --> 00:22:28,424
Well, that's your mother.

408
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,733
Yay!

409
00:22:35,575 --> 00:22:37,672
- That was a fight, mom!

410
00:22:37,672 --> 00:22:39,519
- That was a good fight.

411
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:40,686
- Good job Bo.

412
00:22:41,633 --> 00:22:42,749
- Now that grandma's tired out,

413
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,029
Chad will go up against her.

414
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:46,786
- Jared, go against Bo.

415
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:47,785
- But I am not saying that I will win.

416
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:49,298
- Okay go.

417
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:51,261
Bo is a lot like Griffis.

418
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:54,594
He's really small, but he packs a punch.

419
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:56,882
Come on.

420
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,974
- Hidden strength that no one knows about.

421
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:02,000
I am going to embarrass myself.

422
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,500
- No, you're not, you're good.

423
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,073
- Oh!

424
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:22,540
- Stop curling your arm, you cheater!

425
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,153
- On your mark...

426
00:23:31,153 --> 00:23:32,358
- Wait, wait.

427
00:23:32,358 --> 00:23:33,191
- Get set.

428
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:35,495
Go!

429
00:23:37,061 --> 00:23:40,311
See, his arm curls automatically, look.

430
00:23:44,805 --> 00:23:48,972
Jared's like body's lifted
off the ground, so is Joe's.

431
00:24:01,485 --> 00:24:03,636
- Joe, come on, honey, right now.

432
00:24:03,636 --> 00:24:04,553
Oh my gosh!

433
00:24:11,397 --> 00:24:13,963
- I wanna go get ice cream.

434
00:24:13,963 --> 00:24:16,880
- I don't wanna use my body weight!

435
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,425
- Why is Joe smiling?

436
00:24:25,108 --> 00:24:27,104
- Why's your shoulder on my hand.

437
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:30,937
- I don't wanna use my
body weight, I'm sorry.

438
00:24:32,126 --> 00:24:34,459
- Use your body weight, Joe!

439
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,277
Get your shoulder in there, Joe!

440
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:44,559
- I think the girls should
go against each other.

441
00:24:46,998 --> 00:24:49,857
- He's got Donald Trump hands.

442
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:52,107
(laughter)

443
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:58,724
- Joe beat him!

444
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:11,516
- Alright, this is extended
over to the ladies.

445
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:12,349
Ellie!

446
00:25:13,342 --> 00:25:15,509
(barking)

447
00:25:22,893 --> 00:25:26,060
Bonnie has taken the form of a poodle!

448
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:29,899
- I just got Ellie back in line.

449
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,403
- On your mark.

450
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:51,967
- Hold on, I gotta focus for a second.

451
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,308
- Right, focus up, come on.

452
00:25:54,308 --> 00:25:56,037
- She will probably win me.

453
00:25:56,037 --> 00:25:57,044
- No.

454
00:25:57,044 --> 00:25:58,044
- I've worked out before.

455
00:25:58,044 --> 00:25:59,085
- On your mark!

456
00:25:59,085 --> 00:26:00,103
Get set!

457
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:00,936
Wrestle!

458
00:26:05,512 --> 00:26:06,783
- Oh my gosh!

459
00:26:06,783 --> 00:26:08,033
That's my wife!

460
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:16,356
- Oh my gosh.

461
00:26:18,698 --> 00:26:19,531
- Yeah!

462
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,530
That's my wife!

463
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:26,968
She's the pitbull, ladies and gentlemen!

464
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,994
Alright ladies, Ellie's
climbing up the ladder,

465
00:26:40,994 --> 00:26:42,827
this is for seniority.

466
00:26:46,803 --> 00:26:48,654
- On your mark.

467
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:52,154
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, are you good?

468
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:55,144
- Three, two, one, go.

469
00:26:56,984 --> 00:26:57,817
- Oh!

470
00:26:59,811 --> 00:27:01,571
Get it, get it girl!

471
00:27:01,571 --> 00:27:02,404
Oh!

472
00:27:03,239 --> 00:27:04,435
No!

473
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:05,268
Oh!

474
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,160
Oh no!

475
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,424
- She curled it!

476
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,278
- What!

477
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:17,992
- Wrist position does not matter!

478
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:20,430
Wrist position does not matter!

479
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,513
This is the final battle!

480
00:27:24,928 --> 00:27:27,511
On your mark, get set, wrestle!

481
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,781
- Ah, she's pretty strong.

482
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:37,614
- Yeah!

483
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,487
Uh oh, mom versus Ruby!

484
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,740
- Can I go with grandma?

485
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,823
- I don't even wanna arm wrestle mom.

486
00:28:00,904 --> 00:28:02,154
On your mark...

487
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,908
Are you guys ready?

488
00:28:06,908 --> 00:28:09,075
On your mark, get set, go!

489
00:28:12,852 --> 00:28:15,194
- Come on, come on!

490
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,503
- Come on, Ruby!

491
00:28:16,503 --> 00:28:18,253
- Just give it to me!

492
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:25,725
- What are you waiting for!

493
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:28,136
What are you waiting for!

494
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:29,219
- Oh my gosh!

495
00:28:30,348 --> 00:28:31,181
- Wow!

496
00:28:41,081 --> 00:28:43,414
We'll work on the bark, mom.

497
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:47,257
So, we had a picture about four years ago

498
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:49,800
of these girls with their babies

499
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,500
and we're recreating
our picture right now.

500
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,511
So you have to hold the babies

501
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,237
exactly how you did before, okay?

502
00:28:56,237 --> 00:28:59,066
- Jackson was in me, so
this is gonna take a minute.

503
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:00,192
- One!

504
00:29:00,192 --> 00:29:01,025
- Cheese!

505
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,236
- Who is that?

506
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:14,787
Is that grandpa?

507
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:16,266
Can you close it?

508
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:17,664
Do you love that?

509
00:29:17,664 --> 00:29:19,207
He has already come over
to me a hundred times

510
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:21,490
and has grabbed this and looked at it.

511
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,720
Are you tired?

512
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,553
- Nope.

513
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:24,488
- Should we go home?

514
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:25,321
- Nope.

515
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:26,988
- You wanna play?

516
00:29:26,988 --> 00:29:27,972
Do you wanna go play?

517
00:29:27,972 --> 00:29:29,013
- Yeah!

518
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:33,180
- Bonnie wants to try and be
too sexy for the holidays.

519
00:29:36,617 --> 00:29:38,784
It's hard to be sexy, huh?

520
00:29:42,674 --> 00:29:43,954
- Jared, I want you to spend more

521
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:46,018
time taking my pictures next time too.

522
00:29:46,018 --> 00:29:49,110
- I try to, but you're like, I'm done!

523
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:53,772
I'm done, I'm done taking
pictures with you, Jared!

524
00:29:53,772 --> 00:29:55,570
I like taking pictures of Bonnie because

525
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:58,525
she likes me taking pictures for her!

526
00:29:58,525 --> 00:30:02,181
- That looks like I'm too
sexy for the holidays.

527
00:30:02,181 --> 00:30:03,233
- That'll work.

528
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:05,124
- Collin's had a little too
much eggnog in this picture.

529
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:09,358
Before we all take off
tonight, we just want to wish

530
00:30:09,358 --> 00:30:10,737
from our family to yours...

531
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:12,737
- [All] Merry Christmas!

532
00:30:14,694 --> 00:30:16,114
- There you go!

533
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:17,531
- Is your lens...

534
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:21,055
- What about like, (speaks
in foreign language)

535
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:21,888
- Yeah!

536
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:25,872
(speaks in foreign language)

537
00:30:25,872 --> 00:00:00,000
(heartwarming festive music)
