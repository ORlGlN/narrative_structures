1
00:00:00,154 --> 00:00:02,737
(bright music)

2
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,740
- Fresh laundry, clean
bathroom, fresh sheets,

3
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,278
it feels so good.

4
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,549
The house is clean.

5
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:32,570
It's three o'clock.

6
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,653
I cleaned every bathroom, feels so good.

7
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:37,980
Jared's flight got delayed,

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,215
which kinda stinks, but it
gave me a few extra hours

9
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:45,020
to spruce up, go around
the house and clean

10
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,940
and it feels really good.

11
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,390
So I'm gonna take a
bath, it's three o'clock.

12
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:51,804
The kids have been, guys,

13
00:00:51,804 --> 00:00:54,040
the Hot Wheel track that Jackson got

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,620
for his birthday, no lie, hours.

15
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,230
Him and Calvin have been
hours playing with that.

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,570
I'll play with them for
awhile, I'll do stuff,

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,629
they'll still play.

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,140
It has been such a fun toy,

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,390
I'm so glad we got it.

20
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,100
But I also made an appointment

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,700
with the dermatologist
for Jared and I next week.

22
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,700
So I've had, and a lot of people think,

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,700
I've been tweeting about it

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,460
and a lot of people are like
oh it's pregnancy-related,

25
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,620
which I totally agree, it probably is,

26
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:27,940
but this was a freckle yesterday.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,050
It was a freckle.

28
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,410
And today, it is a mole.

29
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,420
It's raised, or last night I noticed,

30
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,960
so yesterday I noticed that it was raised.

31
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,060
So in a matter of a day and a half,

32
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,490
it went from a flat freckle

33
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,876
to a raised mole.

34
00:01:42,876 --> 00:01:46,130
And the last few weeks,
Jared and I have been talking

35
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,170
that we want to go, just get head to toe

36
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,840
checked out, all of our bumps.

37
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,300
I have a few other mole spots

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,850
that I have some really
weird history behind it

39
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,660
that I want to have a doctor check out.

40
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,420
And Jared has this crazy bump on his back

41
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,200
that we got checked out years ago

42
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,030
and a doctor's like oh it's fine,

43
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,570
but it's getting bigger,

44
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,910
so we just need to go get checked out

45
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,080
from head to toe.

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,490
So I feel good about everything

47
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:11,730
that we've done today,

48
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,090
just getting appointments done,

49
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,660
getting things checked off,

50
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm gonna sit in the bathtub,

51
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,241
and get ready for the day.

52
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:18,074
(laughs)

53
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:19,700
- Good morning, it's another day at CES

54
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,440
and it's another freakin'
exciting adventure.

55
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,730
Look what's behind me.

56
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,230
- [Man] Let's talk about this one first.

57
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,690
- We're back with Mercedes

58
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,640
and we're talking about
another self-driving car,

59
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,227
no big deal.

60
00:02:32,227 --> 00:02:34,810
(upbeat music)

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,150
Alright here we go.

62
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:41,534
Oh man.

63
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,913
This car is just nice on its own.

64
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:48,110
It's so nice in here.

65
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,050
Hey Zack, will you point at Dan

66
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,230
on that computer for me?

67
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,560
- Who's this?
- Can you walk again?

68
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,644
- Yeah look, there he's moving.

69
00:02:55,644 --> 00:02:57,440
There he's moving.

70
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
See he's right up there walking across.

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,980
- [Zack] And look, there's
little yellow lines and stuff.

72
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,250
I think you can even tell
what camera he's holding.

73
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,470
- [Man] Yeah, there's three buttons, yep.

74
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,000
- [Jared] Oh my gosh that's so cool.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,130
So you see all those things moving?

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,963
- [Zack] It's like a video game.

77
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:10,796
- [Jared] Yeah, like a video game.

78
00:03:10,796 --> 00:03:12,260
You're seeing everything just going crazy.

79
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:15,620
Those are all those cars
passing through us right now.

80
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,110
We were just at an intersection earlier

81
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,680
seeing all this cross-traffic going,

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,870
all this turning

83
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,890
and the screen was just lighting up

84
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:22,910
like the Fourth of July.

85
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,120
It was so cool to see
every single data point,

86
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,900
every single potential danger

87
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,170
and everything, what the driver's doing,

88
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,260
where the car is, where the lanes are.

89
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,285
All the cars swimming
across the turn lane,

90
00:03:36,285 --> 00:03:37,380
that's so cool.

91
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,350
I'm having a great time here at CES.

92
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,810
I'm about to go speak again

93
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,420
at the DJI booth.

94
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,110
It was really great yesterday

95
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,840
and I know it's gonna be great today.

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,900
I just am really grateful
for the opportunities

97
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,460
that YouTube has allowed
us to have and to do

98
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,210
and thanks for being along here with us.

99
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,350
It means a lot to me that you guys

100
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:59,140
are here watching and
we're grateful for ya.

101
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,348
And I want to let you know that.

102
00:04:00,348 --> 00:04:03,261
Everyone seems to be looking at something.

103
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:06,261
(atmospheric music)

104
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,459
I'm too short, I have to use it to see

105
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,292
what's going on.

106
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,930
(laughing)

107
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,763
- What is this?

108
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:23,600
Is this just a big LED?

109
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,530
- This is The Wall.

110
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,620
It's like 150 inch--

111
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,810
So I am backstage at
the DJI booth right now,

112
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,440
getting ready for my presentation.

113
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,770
But I just wanted to show you.

114
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,680
You saw on the other side

115
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,900
where they had my screen with my picture?

116
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,320
This is behind all of that.

117
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,910
This is what was making
that picture possible.

118
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,810
That is insane.

119
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,680
It's so cool to see everything

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
behind the scenes here.

121
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,358
Last year I was at CES,

122
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:51,460
I kept getting tweets from Angela

123
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,940
and Angela was like Jared
I've got this collar

124
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,760
for Penny to give to you, let's meet up.

125
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,114
And it just never worked.

126
00:04:58,114 --> 00:04:58,947
- [Angela] Yeah.

127
00:04:58,947 --> 00:04:59,780
- But we finally made it work.

128
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,720
I'm here with Angela.
- Hi.

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,890
- She's part of the
international pet group.

130
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,700
And they have these collars that light up

131
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,150
and does the leash light up too?

132
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,280
- Yeah, they both light up.

133
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,943
- So when you go on a walks in the dark,

134
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:11,810
you know where your dog is,

135
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,190
in case they're going anywhere,

136
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,500
so thank you so much,

137
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,240
it's so nice to finally meet you.

138
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,760
Angela has actually watched out videos

139
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,660
for four years now.

140
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,670
- Yeah.
- So thank you so much

141
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,697
- for being a part of our family.

142
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:22,530
- No problem, yeah.

143
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,400
- It's cool to meet our YouTube family

144
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,320
here at CES.

145
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,160
- Yeah it's fun.

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm glad you're here.

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,910
- I'm glad I'm here
too and we get to meet.

148
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:29,743
Thank you.

149
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:33,850
Well it is officially time
to say goodbye to Las Vegas.

150
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,150
It's been a lot of fun
hanging out and seeing,

151
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,100
and meeting so many new
people and even companies.

152
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,640
That's the coolest part of CES

153
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,403
is you essentially get a small look

154
00:05:42,403 --> 00:05:45,030
into the future of this year

155
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,960
from all sorts of companies, old and new.

156
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,870
But I think my favorite
part is being there

157
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,220
with some of my buddies,

158
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,680
Dan, Zack and meeting some
new friends along the way.

159
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,200
I am so excited to get home to my family.

160
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,290
I have a couple goodies for the boys

161
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,020
and I'm hoping that they're still awake

162
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,290
by the time I get home.

163
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,960
The unfortunate news of the day

164
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,290
is that my flight was delayed three hours.

165
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:08,670
So kinda good, kinda bad.

166
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:09,870
It gave me some extra time

167
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,340
to edit Jackson's birthday video

168
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,940
and I was able to change a few things

169
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,860
and make it more exciting,

170
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,330
more Ellie and Jared
vlog-like, birthday-like.

171
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,720
Those days are very special to us

172
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,740
and those are the days that we want

173
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,520
to look back on the most.

174
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,390
And those flashbacks, they get me right

175
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,620
in the heartstrings and they pull at them

176
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,160
and I cry and it's amazing and I love it.

177
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,900
CES is not everyone's favorite thing,

178
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,140
especially with some of our viewers here.

179
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,390
But I want to do things
that I'm passionate about,

180
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,930
something I strive for.

181
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,500
And I know not a lot of people voted

182
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,780
on the tech and reviews thing,

183
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,766
but I feel like if I
don't do something that--

184
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:48,370
- [On Intercom] May I have
your attention please.

185
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,560
If you're the person taking the long--

186
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,910
- - And if I do things that
I'm more passionate about,

187
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,600
whether that be music,
tech, sports, anything,

188
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,180
I think you'll see a
little bit more of that.

189
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,500
Because when you do the things
that you're passionate about,

190
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,960
you get fulfillment and
I want to be fulfilled

191
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,867
and I want you to see that fulfillment

192
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:09,900
coming through in what we do everyday.

193
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,140
But for now, I'm excited
to get home to the kids.

194
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,553
So let's board an airplane
in an hour and a half.

195
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:16,386
(groans)

196
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:19,969
(bright atmospheric music)

197
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:25,313
(beeping)

198
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:26,146
- [Woman] There you go.

199
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,146
- Thank you.

200
00:07:31,137 --> 00:07:33,047
Free up freed, not too bad.

201
00:07:33,047 --> 00:07:34,150
- [Woman] This is seven.

202
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,021
- [Jared] Oh I'm in seven?

203
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:35,854
Oh I'm sorry.

204
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:38,085
- [Woman] It's all good.

205
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,885
- [Jared] It's been a long day guys.

206
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,703
- [Flight Attendant] Ladies and gentlemen,

207
00:07:41,703 --> 00:07:44,670
on behalf of Delta and our
Sky Team partners worldwide,

208
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,700
welcome aboard your Delta Connection.

209
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,382
This is our service to Salt
Lake City International.

210
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,965
(bright atmospheric music)

211
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:25,529
(rolling marbles)

212
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,180
- [Ellie] The kids love
to sit here and play

213
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,770
with their marbles before bedtime.

214
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,403
- Hey, that is the wrong marble.

215
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:38,472
- [Ellie] It's too big?

216
00:08:38,472 --> 00:08:39,476
- Uh-huh.

217
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,351
(Calvin vocalizing)

218
00:08:41,351 --> 00:08:43,443
- [Ellie] Okay, go to sleep,
go to sleep, go to sleep.

219
00:08:43,443 --> 00:08:45,098
Jackson's coming, hide hide.

220
00:08:45,098 --> 00:08:46,270
- Ready.
- Okay, be quiet.

221
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,720
- [Ellie] Be quiet, be quiet.

222
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,756
Is Calvin with you?

223
00:08:51,756 --> 00:08:52,589
- Yep.

224
00:08:53,623 --> 00:08:56,069
(Ellie laughs)

225
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,390
Get on your side.
(laughing)

226
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,939
- [Ellie] Alright, everyone sitting?

227
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:00,772
- Uh-huh.

228
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:01,605
- [Ellie] You ready?

229
00:09:01,605 --> 00:09:02,438
- Uh-huh.

230
00:09:02,438 --> 00:09:03,271
- I'm gonna read two books tonight.

231
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:05,310
We are reading George Catches a Cold,

232
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,070
which I am so glad nobody,

233
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,050
I mean it's January, watch,

234
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,200
tomorrow's vlog I'll
be like, I have a cold.

235
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,620
We have not had colds.

236
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,240
We have all felt really well.

237
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,270
The other day was really funny with Calvin

238
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,860
when he woke up and was
pale and not feeling well.

239
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,150
He seemed fine the rest of the day

240
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,540
and all day today, he
has seemed really fine.

241
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,860
And we are gonna be reading,

242
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,000
What Does it Mean to Be Present?

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,734
So that is what we are reading tonight.

244
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,037
- I want to do this one and this one.

245
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:31,880
- [Ellie] Okay.

246
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,950
- This one first.

247
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,783
- Okay.

248
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:40,800
Well I'm pretty sure
In-N-Out will be way gross

249
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,890
by the time you get here.
(bell dings)

250
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,440
No I'm good.

251
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,210
I don't need anything, thanks.

252
00:09:47,597 --> 00:09:50,210
Jared's like I just got off the flight

253
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,510
and I'm stopping at In-N-Out.

254
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,840
And I'm like blaaaaaa,

255
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,710
I want In-N-Out.

256
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,100
We used to go there all the time,

257
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,540
when we were in college.

258
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,640
We loved it.

259
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,840
I don't need any food, I've already eaten,

260
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,900
but I'm a little jealous

261
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,100
that's he's at In-N-Out.

262
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,300
I can't wait for Jared to get home.

263
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,270
I want to ask him,

264
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,880
we haven't even really
been able to talk much.

265
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,250
When he was at, was it CES?

266
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,670
A few years ago, when there
was this cool new breast pump

267
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,719
that came out, there was cool bassinetes

268
00:10:23,719 --> 00:10:27,400
that had come out, like baby electronics,

269
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,010
so I'm excited to see if he saw anything,

270
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,117
because we don't need hardly anything,

271
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:38,380
some pacifiers, some clothes for sure,

272
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,570
for the baby, but we a crib,

273
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,680
we have a Pack n' Play, we have toys.

274
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,080
We pretty much have what we need,

275
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,740
but the one thing I would like to get

276
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,760
is a bassinet.

277
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,120
Because I don't know why I
never bought one with Calvin,

278
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,020
and Jackson, just having
them on the side of your bed,

279
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,170
even if it's just for a
month, it still is so nice,

280
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,730
rather than a big old Pack n' Play.

281
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,860
Easier to bend and grab the baby.

282
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,380
So that's probably
something that I will buy,

283
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,590
but I wonder if they have
come out with any cool stuff.

284
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:11,720
Jared just pulled up and I can't wait.

285
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,090
I'm just gonna stand here creepily,

286
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,300
because he got me that little bump gift

287
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,630
and it has a massager in it.

288
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,900
You know, I've been waiting a few days

289
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,555
for him to come home and rub my back.

290
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:21,560
(laughs)

291
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm just gonna stay just like this,

292
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,130
until he walks in the door.

293
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:30,424
(laughs)

294
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,257
- Hello.

295
00:11:32,202 --> 00:11:33,470
(Jared laughs)

296
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,480
Are you holding that
so I'll rub your back?

297
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,480
- I've been waiting.

298
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,440
- Okay, let me--

299
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,100
- [Ellie] Why did you order me a gift

300
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,030
and then not be home for two days?

301
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,370
(Jared laughs)

302
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,842
- Is that from the Bump Box?

303
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:44,800
- [Ellie] Yes.

304
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,425
- Okay, turn around.

305
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:48,470
(Ellie laughs)

306
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

307
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,470
- [Ellie] You stink.

308
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,872
- [Jared] I do?

309
00:11:52,872 --> 00:11:53,705
- You do.

310
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:54,538
Just like traveling.

311
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,371
- I stink.

312
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,530
- Just like traveling.

313
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,363
- [Jared] I missed you

314
00:11:59,363 --> 00:12:00,270
- [Ellie] I missed you.

315
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,960
- Your belly Ellie.

316
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,922
Oh my goodness, look at it.

317
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:05,870
- It grew since you weren't at home.

318
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,942
- [Jared] It did, it really did.

319
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:08,775
- Overnight.

320
00:12:08,775 --> 00:12:11,560
- Especially the Instagram you posted.

321
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,570
It was just so cute.
- Yeah?

322
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,403
- Thanks.

323
00:12:14,403 --> 00:12:16,150
- I am just so happy to be home.

324
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,622
Like it just feels good to be home

325
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:18,870
- [Ellie] I'm so glad you're home.

326
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,820
- and not surrounded by one million people

327
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,660
and bumping shoulders all the time.

328
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,850
It's kinda fun, but I'm glad I'm home.

329
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,960
Okay let's be honest, I'm kind of a nerd,

330
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,710
the first thing that
we did when I got home

331
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,010
is I showed Ellie the Model 3 footage

332
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,712
- I liked it.
- on the camera.

333
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,040
- I'm excited, it was so fun.

334
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,873
- I'm not gonna lie,

335
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,160
when Jared has talked
about Teslas in the past,

336
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,860
I've tried to be like, that's really cool,

337
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,900
but it's not been my thing,

338
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,000
but they are sweet.

339
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,833
- [Jared] Yeah.

340
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:49,680
- When Dan let me get in it, they're cool.

341
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,980
I'm glad you got to do it.

342
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,773
- It's kind of like a dream,

343
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,840
but we'll see how things go.

344
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,870
Ellie and I are going to watch a movie

345
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,880
or watch a show, because
it's been three days

346
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,220
since we've seen each other,

347
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,010
and that's what we do every
night when we're together,

348
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,570
so why change now?

349
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,920
- That is so true.
- Right?

350
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,713
- Yeah, so let's say
goodnight to our friends.

351
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:07,640
- (whispering) Goodnight guys.

352
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,473
- Goodnight.

353
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:09,590
- Have a wonderful day

354
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:11,840
and we will see you
guys tomorrow, Saturday.

355
00:13:11,840 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching, bye.
