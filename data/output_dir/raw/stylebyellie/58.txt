1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,211
(cascading coins)

2
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:02,756
- Whoa!

3
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:04,660
- That's a lot of money.

4
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,490
- Jackson and I are gonna go
do something fun right now.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,010
He's got a big smile on his face.

6
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,750
Hey, you ready?

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,850
Is it everything you hoped and dreamed of?

8
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,280
So at lunch today, we had our superheroes

9
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,920
all along the bench

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,070
and it was so cute.

11
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,400
- [Bonnie] This is too cute to not record.

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,210
Look how cute these guys are?

13
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:28,780
- We had Spiderman, Spiderman,

14
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,450
Buzz Lightyear and Captain Underpants,

15
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:33,570
because Calvin was in his underpants

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,870
because he's doing potty training

17
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,080
and that was just the sweetest
thing during lunchtime.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,360
Please forgive the interruption
in your regular programming,

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,270
I wanted to make you
aware of some big news.

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,960
I have been tweeting back and forth

21
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,620
with YouTube about notifications

22
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,010
and notifications are
not working that well

23
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,350
on YouTube right now.

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,600
So I just wanted to come in

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,610
and hop in real quick
and let you guys know,

26
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,370
if you haven't already, make sure you hit

27
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,010
that red subscribe button

28
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,480
and the bell notification
right next to it.

29
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,900
YouTube has been having some
issues getting our videos

30
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,410
into your subscription boxes

31
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,180
and the best way to make sure

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,810
that you know exactly when we have

33
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:10,770
a video go live, is hitting
that bell notification

34
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,410
right next to the subscribe button.

35
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,570
That sends a push
notification to your phone

36
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,750
that tells you we have a video go live

37
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,530
and it's usually the fastest.

38
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,160
So if you wouldn't mind doing me a favor,

39
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,610
hit that subscribe button,

40
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,130
hit the bell notification,

41
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,520
so you guys won't miss a video ever again.

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,120
Hopefully, crossing our fingers,

43
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,440
YouTube said that should
help a lot with that

44
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,560
so thank you guys so much for doing that

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,230
and again, sorry for the interruption,

46
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,120
back to our regularly programmed schedule.

47
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,010
Today Jackson and I have something planned

48
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,180
that we want to do.

49
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,307
We mentioned that we wanted
to get his piggy bank

50
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:44,270
all situated and take all of the coins,

51
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,270
because it's so heavy

52
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,170
and cash them in and we're
grateful that a lot of you guys,

53
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,860
we mentioned going to Coinstar,

54
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,240
we're grateful that a lot of you mentioned

55
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,480
that there's a big fee
associated with that,

56
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,170
so we're gonna go to a bank instead.

57
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,210
So Jackson, we haven't really talked

58
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,355
about this too much,
but do you want to know,

59
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:02,800
we're gonna do something fun today.

60
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,720
Come with me.

61
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,720
So in here, oh my goodness.

62
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,880
It's so heavy.

63
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,840
Jackson, your piggy bank
is so heavy, come here.

64
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,150
Try and hold it.

65
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,100
Can you lift it?

66
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,760
Is it heavy?

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,850
- Nope.

68
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,320
- You're so strong, oh look at you.

69
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,670
It's pretty heavy though, huh?

70
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,740
Don't drop it on your
toe, that would be so bad.

71
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,680
So what we're gonna do

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,790
is we're gonna put all of the money

73
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,980
and we're gonna take it out

74
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,640
and we're gonna put it in a bag.

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,310
We're gonna take that bag to the bank

76
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,980
and they're gonna make them
into bills, dollar bills.

77
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,760
And we'll put them back
in your piggy bank,

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,977
because this is full of money and coins

79
00:02:43,977 --> 00:02:46,010
and it's heavy and we're
gonna make 'em bills,

80
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,810
so you can fit more inside of here.

81
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,958
- What do we do with this?

82
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:50,910
- [Jared] That's for the combination,

83
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,360
so you can unlock it.

84
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,193
That's pretty cool, huh?

85
00:02:53,193 --> 00:02:54,578
So no one takes your money.

86
00:02:54,578 --> 00:02:55,411
- Yep.

87
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,244
- Yep.

88
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:57,077
Do you think that's a good idea?

89
00:02:57,077 --> 00:02:57,910
Should we go do that today?

90
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,258
Should we go to the bank and do this?

91
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:00,091
- Yes.

92
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,750
- Okay, let's go get
it and put it in a bag.

93
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,696
- Oh yeah.

94
00:03:02,696 --> 00:03:04,740
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

95
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,290
- Okay, so I think what will be easiest

96
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,230
for us and the bank

97
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,850
is to take all--

98
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,060
oh my gosh it's heavy,

99
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,440
all of the money in here--

100
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,580
- But I can hold it.

101
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,075
- Yeah and we'll put
the coins in each bag,

102
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:19,320
so we'll put pennies in one bag,

103
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,440
we'll put nickels in another bag,

104
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,883
we'll dimes in another bag,

105
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:23,780
quarters in another bag

106
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,870
and we'll call that good.

107
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,121
Take it in so it's
easier for them to count.

108
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:27,040
(Jackson groans)

109
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,380
It's heavy huh?

110
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,360
So let's see how we can
figure out, oh my goodness,

111
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,440
how to open this.

112
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:34,210
(gasps)

113
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,867
We did it.

114
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:36,770
- Yeah.

115
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,240
- Yeah oh look, this is
money that Mom and Dad got

116
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,280
while we were in China.

117
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Is that pretty cool?

118
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,430
Look at all this money.

119
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,115
Should we pour it out on the table?

120
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,935
(cascading coins)

121
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,566
Whoa!

122
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:53,680
- That's a lot of money.

123
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,690
- Look at all these bills
you got in here too.

124
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,230
Oh my gosh, here's a five dollar bill.

125
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,879
Do you know how much
a five dollar bill is?

126
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:01,712
- Mmm-hmm.

127
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:05,320
- A five dollar bill is
five one dollar bills.

128
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Do you know how many a one dollar bill is?

129
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,030
- No.

130
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,930
- It's four of these quarters.

131
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,870
Do you know how much a quarter is?

132
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,630
Is two and a half of these dimes.

133
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,100
Do you know how much a dime is?

134
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,970
It's two of these nickels.

135
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,420
Do you know how many nickels are these?

136
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,100
It's five of these pennies.

137
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,279
And that's how money works.

138
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,013
This one is called a penny.

139
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,020
All these brown ones are called copper.

140
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,460
We're gonna put 'em in this bag.

141
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,060
So I want you to find all of these ones

142
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,452
and we'll put 'em in this bag, okay?

143
00:04:28,452 --> 00:04:29,285
- Okay.

144
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:30,470
Oh I have another one.

145
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,930
- Okay, put it in this bag.

146
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:35,190
- Oh what is this?

147
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,980
- That is, oh that is, a game token.

148
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,629
We'll put that one aside.

149
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,081
For like an arcade.

150
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,352
- Mom!

151
00:04:43,352 --> 00:04:44,516
- [Ellie] What?

152
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:47,322
- You have to check this out on the table!

153
00:04:47,322 --> 00:04:48,897
(Jared laughs)

154
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,673
(gasps)

155
00:04:50,673 --> 00:04:51,786
- What?

156
00:04:51,786 --> 00:04:54,640
It couldn't fit one more coin,

157
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,700
it was full.
- So full.

158
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,280
- Okay, organize this all up.

159
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,113
- Yep.

160
00:04:59,113 --> 00:05:01,420
Okay I think we got all of
the pennies in one pile.

161
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,215
Now Jackson, I want you to
grab this bag right here.

162
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:08,620
I want you to hold it
open right here, okay?

163
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:10,550
And then I will scoop these pennies in,

164
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,398
so hold it right underneath the table.

165
00:05:12,398 --> 00:05:13,231
- [Jackson] Okay.

166
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:14,064
(cascading coins)

167
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,413
- [Jared] Oh I'm dropping some.

168
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,540
Ah!

169
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,110
Okay, we'll pick up the rest on the floor.

170
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,150
Whoa, don't drop the bag!

171
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,983
Oh wow, yeah we did drop a lot.

172
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:23,023
(lively music)

173
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:23,856
(coins clinking)

174
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,689
Nice.

175
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,020
Now we'll seal this up
woop, and we'll do nickels.

176
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,743
- Is this a nickel?

177
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:32,140
- [Jared] That is a nickel, good job.

178
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,772
- [Ellie] Since he was one years old,

179
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:37,290
this is what his piggy
bank has accumulated to.

180
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,940
- I feel like he has more
money in this piggy bank

181
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,990
than I ever got until I was 12 years old.

182
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,080
Okay we got our nickel bag,

183
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,200
no pun intended.

184
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,650
I'm sure the bank has a sorting machine,

185
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,990
but this is just fun for me and my son

186
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,920
to do together.

187
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,039
Is this fun buddy?

188
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:56,872
- Yep.

189
00:05:56,872 --> 00:05:58,120
- Yep yep, and we're learning

190
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,980
about the coins too as we go.

191
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,680
Can you show me a quarter?

192
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,930
Yeah, can you show me a dime?

193
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,790
Yep, there you go, good job bud.

194
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:09,530
So we've got dimes, quarters, nickels,

195
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:15,170
pennies and then all of these
dolla dolla bills ya'll.

196
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,810
Here's my question Jackson,

197
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,070
we have all of this money right here

198
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,480
in all of these bags,

199
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,300
how much money do you think there is here?

200
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,180
I would like to know what your guess is.

201
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,970
So we've got all of these pennies,

202
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,630
we've got all of these nickels,

203
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,780
we've got all of these quarters

204
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,190
and we've got all of these dimes.

205
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,450
And we've got a few various bills here.

206
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,010
My guess is that we have

207
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,281
$63 dollars, that's my guess, $63 dollars.

208
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:46,940
- 63?

209
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,820
- [Jared] Yep, that's my guess.

210
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,780
What's your guess?

211
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,200
- 69.

212
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,440
- 69?

213
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,940
You're kinda going the Price is Right

214
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,500
and you're going a little bit above me

215
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,810
without going over, huh?

216
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:58,390
How much do you think

217
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,510
are in those bags?

218
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,240
- I can tell he went to Grandma's.

219
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,448
Oh these are quarters.

220
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:05,916
- [Jared] Yeah, that is a lot of quarters.

221
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,290
- Usually if Jackson sees a quarter,

222
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,359
he'll be like can I put this?

223
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,860
This is all from Grandma.

224
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,860
- [Jared] Yep.

225
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,950
- She gave him for his birthday.

226
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,790
- [Jared] All those nickels,
she had a roll of nickels

227
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,623
that she gave.

228
00:07:14,623 --> 00:07:16,380
- I bet he has $70 dollars.

229
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,213
- $70 dollars?

230
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,610
Okay, we're all thinking
about the same thing.

231
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,890
I said 63, Jackson said 69

232
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,723
and you say 70.

233
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:25,030
Okay buddy, are you ready to do this?

234
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,863
- Yeah.

235
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:27,030
- [Jared] Alright, can you hold these?

236
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,280
You got 'em?

237
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,113
Oh oh!

238
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,540
How about Dad helps you a little, oh!

239
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,413
You know what, this is
pretty cool Jackson,

240
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:34,246
- Uh-huh.

241
00:07:34,246 --> 00:07:37,010
- [Jared] This is all the
money that you've earned

242
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,400
doing chores, from your birthdays,

243
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,330
all of that, we're gonna
make em into bills.

244
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,390
Okay look, that's our
counting machine right there.

245
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,570
We're gonna put 'em all in there

246
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,080
and see how many we have, okay?

247
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,317
So put these ones on the 10,

248
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:49,810
because they're a dime.

249
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,810
Okay, can you do that?

250
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,030
Okay we're almost done,
we've got one two three

251
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,700
of those almost filled Jackson.

252
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,900
Can you even believe that?

253
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,540
- [Teller] All of the
change, is coming out

254
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,854
to $49 dollars and 63 cents.

255
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:03,885
- [Jared] She's gonna
count the dollar bills now.

256
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,040
(counting machine clicking)

257
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,050
whoa, that's cool.

258
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,280
$37 dollars.

259
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,728
- [Teller] Guess what, are
you ready for the total?

260
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:14,517
$85 dollars and 83 cents.

261
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:17,260
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

262
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,597
Good job buddy.
- That is a lot of money.

263
00:08:19,597 --> 00:08:22,220
- That is so much, good job.
- Yay!

264
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,660
- That's great bud.

265
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,110
Are you gonna put it all
back in your piggy bank?

266
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,439
- No.

267
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,272
(laughing)

268
00:08:28,272 --> 00:08:29,105
- [Teller] He's like I'm gonna spend that.

269
00:08:29,105 --> 00:08:30,455
- I'm gonna spend it.

270
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:31,620
We'll talk about that.

271
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,850
Good job bud.

272
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,309
There you go Jackson.

273
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,179
- [Teller] Look I'm even gonna give you

274
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,029
some change back.

275
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:38,020
- [Jared] Can you believe that?

276
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,740
- [Teller] Look, you want
some change back too?

277
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,840
That's what's left over.

278
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,870
There you go.

279
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,780
Should we get you a
special envelope for it?

280
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,797
- [Jared] That's a great idea.

281
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:45,630
- [Teller] Here.

282
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,230
- I cannot even believe that Jackson,

283
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,600
that is so great.

284
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,370
You've got your special little envelope.

285
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,290
That's fun, huh.

286
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,560
So you know what Mommy and I do?

287
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,130
Every month when we get paid,

288
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:01,060
we put money in savings,
like your piggy bank.

289
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,790
We give some money to those who need it

290
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,520
and then we take a little bit

291
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,070
and we have some fun.

292
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,481
And so I have in my pocket a few quarters.

293
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:13,320
- And a treat, and a special treat.

294
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,020
- And we're gonna go do something special.

295
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,090
I'm so proud of you, that's my boy,

296
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,781
it's like you won the
lottery Jackson, good job.

297
00:09:19,781 --> 00:09:20,614
- [Ellie] Hi.

298
00:09:20,614 --> 00:09:21,480
- Hi, how are ya?

299
00:09:23,091 --> 00:09:24,650
- [Ellie] Good, you sound happy.

300
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,110
- Well yeah, guess how much
Jackson had in his piggy bank?

301
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,480
- [Ellie] How much?

302
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,552
- Do you wanna tell her?

303
00:09:29,552 --> 00:09:30,914
- 87.

304
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:31,747
- [Ellie] What?

305
00:09:31,747 --> 00:09:34,440
- $87 dollars, can you believe that?

306
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,500
I talked to Jackson, I said
when Mommy and Daddy get paid,

307
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,000
we put a lot of that money
right back into savings

308
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,730
and then we give some
money to those who need it

309
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,800
and then we take a little bit of it

310
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,270
and we go something fun,

311
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,020
and Jackson and I are gonna
do something fun right now.

312
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,083
- [Ellie] Cool.

313
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,840
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

314
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,360
- He's got a big smile on his face.

315
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,700
Hey, you ready?

316
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,720
Okay love you.

317
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,340
So Jackson, when we come to Walmart,

318
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,170
we don't usually have quarters with us.

319
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,010
And what do you always want to do

320
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,260
with quarters in Walmart?

321
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,480
Yep, go on the rides.

322
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,311
So guess what, you can finally do that

323
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,380
because you have quarters.

324
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,240
Do you want to pick a ride

325
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,840
or pick a machine and do it?

326
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,070
- I want to do

327
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:20,862
this!

328
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:22,510
- [Jared] Oh the
motorcycle, that looks cool.

329
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,710
Oh no, it's out of order.

330
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,480
Shoot, we'll have to pick a different one.

331
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,793
Pumbaa?

332
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:29,626
- Yep.

333
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:32,840
- [Jared] Alright, it's 50
cents, that's two quarters.

334
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,632
So put those in and you can go for a ride.

335
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:36,950
One, do one at a time,

336
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,480
there you got one, there
you go, hold on tight.

337
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,313
Enjoy the ride.

338
00:10:41,313 --> 00:10:42,358
Whoa.

339
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:43,457
(Jared laughs)

340
00:10:43,457 --> 00:10:46,040
(bright music)

341
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,242
Is it everything you hoped and dreamed of?

342
00:10:53,242 --> 00:10:54,075
- Yeah.

343
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,710
- [Jared] Yeah, you like it?

344
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:57,448
- I'm gonna do this one.

345
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,443
- [Jared] Okay, this
is a Ghostbusters ride.

346
00:11:00,443 --> 00:11:03,026
(bright music)

347
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,600
You put 'em right in here, one at a time.

348
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,770
Now these crane games are kinda tricky.

349
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,650
We should probably call Sam

350
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,840
and ask him for some help.

351
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,020
Move it where you want it.

352
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,770
And then when you're ready
to push it, push the button.

353
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:23,448
Ooooh.

354
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,040
No, darnit, we were so close.

355
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,350
Okay, that's it.

356
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,250
High five, good job bud.

357
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,310
Jackson, you have worked so hard

358
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,199
to fill up that piggy bank, haven't you?

359
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:38,032
- Uh-huh.

360
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,526
- And Calvin is working
so hard on potty training.

361
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:41,359
- Uh-huh.

362
00:11:41,359 --> 00:11:42,192
- So one of the things we're gonna grab

363
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:43,510
here at the store, we're gonna grab

364
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,520
some little prizes for Calvin

365
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,670
for when he goes potty in the toilet,

366
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,820
we'll give him a little prize.

367
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,210
Will you help me pick some of those out?

368
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,043
- Yeah.

369
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
- Okay.

370
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:52,710
- Toy out for Calvin.

371
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,090
- [Jared] You're gonna pick a toy out?

372
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,382
That sounds like a nice thing to do

373
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,215
for your brother.

374
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,165
- We have to go all the way back there.

375
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,473
- Okay.

376
00:12:00,473 --> 00:12:03,490
So we want to just get little
little victories for Calvin.

377
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,770
So things like oh,

378
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,700
I like these little surprise toys,

379
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,320
because you don't know what's inside.

380
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,312
So we'll get a couple Comics.
- A mash 'em, Dad!

381
00:12:11,312 --> 00:12:12,524
- [Jared] And maybe a couple Toy Story.

382
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,915
- Mashem!

383
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:15,004
I got a Mashem.

384
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:15,837
- [Jared] A Mashem?

385
00:12:15,837 --> 00:12:16,853
- Uh-huh.

386
00:12:16,853 --> 00:12:17,686
- [Jared] I think that could work.

387
00:12:17,686 --> 00:12:18,519
Here's some more Mashems.

388
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:20,240
Pick a cool one for Calvin.

389
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,840
Spiderman's all the way up here.

390
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:26,943
(lively guitar music)

391
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,640
So like I said earlier,

392
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,490
Mommy and Daddy do some things

393
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,110
with the money that we earn.

394
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,220
And we think that it's a pretty good thing

395
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,220
to keep money into savings

396
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,980
for what's called a
rainy day, just in case.

397
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,650
And it's nice to put
this in your piggy bank

398
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,750
so you have it.

399
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,320
So you keep it in a safe spot.

400
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,590
I mean if you invest this smart,

401
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,560
maybe put it in an aggressive growth stock

402
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,820
mutual fund that has a 12% return

403
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,400
over the last hundred years,

404
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,610
you could be a millionaire

405
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,090
by the time you're five.

406
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,730
So Jackson, now that you
have money in dollar bills,

407
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,870
how do you feel?

408
00:13:04,073 --> 00:13:04,906
(Jared laughing)

409
00:13:04,906 --> 00:13:06,740
Did you have a fun day with Daddy today.

410
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,770
Good, we got a lot done.

411
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,600
And we did a big goal for you.

412
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,540
This was cool.

413
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,780
I hope you remember this for a long time.

414
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,140
And I hope you remember
the principals we taught

415
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,860
and the Mashems that we got.

416
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,210
And the rhymes we make

417
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:22,080
and the time we take.

418
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,650
I'm a rhyming machine,

419
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,650
now if only I could get lean.

420
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,348
Can you say goodnight to our friends?

421
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:29,280
- Goodnight.

422
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,770
- That is is for us today.

423
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,670
While some of us are hunkering down

424
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,560
in the bathroom going
through potty training

425
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,420
and getting that done and taken care of,

426
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:41,470
others are doing things
like getting AirPods

427
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,330
out of the car or taking kids to the bank

428
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:46,110
to, changing their money,

429
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,560
so today's been a pretty fun day

430
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,690
and I'm just grateful for my family

431
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,260
and I'm grateful for my parents

432
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,620
and the things that they taught me

433
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,800
so I can teach those things to my kids

434
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,990
with my wife, and I'm grateful for that.

435
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,330
I'm grateful that Ellie's pregnant.

436
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,350
She has been feeling great

437
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,780
and I'm very happy about that.

438
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:05,700
So with that, I hope you
guys are feeling great,

439
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,270
I hope you have a wonderful day

440
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,910
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

441
00:14:08,910 --> 00:00:00,000
Thanks for watching, bye.
