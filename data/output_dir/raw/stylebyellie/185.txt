00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:02,156
[gentle music]

2
00:00:12,545 --> 00:00:16,699
- The uncertainty of when
is what's hard, I think,

3
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:20,532
I don't quite know how
to mentally grasp that.

4
00:00:21,575 --> 00:00:23,331
I could not sleep last night,

5
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:25,145
I was having nightmares all night,

6
00:00:25,145 --> 00:00:26,788
I was rolling back and forth all night.

7
00:00:26,788 --> 00:00:29,443
I woke up this morning
with a very light cramping.

8
00:00:29,443 --> 00:00:31,877
Watch yesterday's video
if you wanna be caught up.

9
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:34,093
I just woke up really sad

10
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:37,320
and I don't want to do this again

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,507
and I can feel that
things might be starting

12
00:00:40,507 --> 00:00:43,776
and I'm just very blue and very sad.

13
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,562
I stayed up last night,
I grabbed a few books

14
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:49,143
because I'm just so sick,
I don't wanna watch TV,

15
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,291
I don't wanna do anything,

16
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,773
and I'm not really one to read a ton,

17
00:00:52,773 --> 00:00:54,776
I really love to listen to books,

18
00:00:54,776 --> 00:00:56,302
especially when we're on the road.

19
00:00:56,302 --> 00:00:58,593
But I did pick up a few books last night

20
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,926
and I'm excited to read them

21
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:05,047
but we gotta get the kids to school.

22
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,636
[gentle music]

23
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:24,263
I just dropped Jackson off at school

24
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:27,581
and I have a few
pregnancy apps on my phone

25
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,701
because I was seeing
which one I liked the best

26
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:33,609
and I had What To Expect, I had Nurture,

27
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:35,382
I had Baby Center and then The Bump.

28
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:38,229
And The Bump was by far my favorite.

29
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,464
I loved going to it everyday
saying how big the baby was,

30
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,302
saying how far along I was.

31
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:46,942
It had like a 3D version of
like what the baby looked like,

32
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,603
I just got a notification
and email from them.

33
00:01:49,603 --> 00:01:52,424
So it's just like little
things, it's like I have to just

34
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:55,056
step back and like step back into reality

35
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:58,217
and get rid of them and stop
notifications on my email

36
00:01:58,217 --> 00:02:00,081
and it's just crazy.

37
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:03,414
Thank you Bonnie, you are so good to us.

38
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:06,096
- I love you!

39
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:07,742
- Thanks for letting me be a flip-flopper.

40
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,817
She's like "I'll come over and
sit and hang out with you!"

41
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,032
I was like "That sounds great!"

42
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:11,866
She was like "I'll bring you lunch."

43
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,211
I'm like "No I'm not
hungry, not in the mood."

44
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,985
Then she got here I was like "I'm hungry!

45
00:02:15,985 --> 00:02:17,077
"And Pamela's hungry"
[Laughing]

46
00:02:17,077 --> 00:02:18,156
So we all got to eat.

47
00:02:18,156 --> 00:02:21,329
I keep telling her I called my zit Pamela.

48
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:24,392
- You call her Pamela? I
thought it was little Jared.

49
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:26,600
- [Ellie] So we're hungry,
we're gonna eat, thank you.

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,985
- Have you ever broken into something

51
00:02:27,985 --> 00:02:30,029
you're not supposed to be in,

52
00:02:30,029 --> 00:02:32,188
or maybe have you ever
broken into something

53
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:35,504
you're supposed to be in
but can't get inside of?

54
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,998
That is the predicament I'm in.

55
00:02:36,998 --> 00:02:39,808
I'm not breaking into something
I'm not supposed to be in,

56
00:02:39,808 --> 00:02:42,629
I need something out
of a safe that I have,

57
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,595
it's very important but I can't get in it.

58
00:02:45,595 --> 00:02:49,046
I can't find the key and
the biometric sensor battery

59
00:02:49,046 --> 00:02:52,119
is dead. We've got a couple
of things that we can try.

60
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:54,048
Joel has a very similar one

61
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:55,710
and we're gonna see if his key works.

62
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,256
If not, we may have to
break into this bad boy.

63
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:02,716
Yes, I'm talking 'bout you,
grrr shake my fist at you!

64
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,140
So Joel if this key works
I think that says something

65
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,845
about the security of these things.

66
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:08,601
- [Joel] Yeah.

67
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:09,694
No go.

68
00:03:09,694 --> 00:03:12,407
- Okay, shoot. Alright
do you have a bobby pin?

69
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:15,298
And maybe like a flathead screwdriver?

70
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:18,399
- Oh, yeah, let me grab
my lock-picking kit

71
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:21,362
- Are lock-picking kits illegal?

72
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:22,195
- [Joel] I'm assuming so

73
00:03:22,195 --> 00:03:24,160
- If they are then I
definitely don't have one.

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,812
- [Joel] I don't have one.

75
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:27,434
- I definitely don't if they're illegal.

76
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:29,585
If they're illegal, I don't know,

77
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,965
I can't answer that question
because it might be illegal.

78
00:03:31,965 --> 00:03:34,233
One of Ellie's friends from
church is an incredible artist

79
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,415
and she did this amazing painting for us

80
00:03:36,415 --> 00:03:38,165
and we got it framed and
we just got a phone call

81
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,631
that it's all done and so
I'm here to pick it up.

82
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,814
And I know this is gonna
lift Ellie's spirits,

83
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:45,859
I know Ellie's doing so amazing as it is

84
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,909
but I know this will be

85
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:49,171
a really, really great
pick-me-up for her too.

86
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,740
So here it is, actually it's upside down

87
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:56,554
so there it is. It is way
bigger than I thought.

88
00:03:56,554 --> 00:03:57,938
It is way big.

89
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,326
I thought it'd be able to
fit in the van top to bottom

90
00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:02,411
but it's actually too
tall and we can't fit it

91
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,037
in between the seats so
I'm gonna have to come back

92
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,515
with all of the car
seats out and everything

93
00:04:07,515 --> 00:04:08,685
so I can fit it in there.

94
00:04:08,685 --> 00:04:12,709
And maybe even need a
truck 'cause it's big guys.

95
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:13,625
- [Jared] Hey!

96
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,540
(Ellie screams)

97
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,307
Did I scare you?

98
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,413
- I did not like that

99
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:18,880
- [Jared] Calvin, where
are you taking my wife?

100
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,788
- I did not like that!

101
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,071
- [Jared] Did I scare you good?

102
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,904
- You did.

103
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,768
- I'm sorry. Calvin is
driving you on a little date.

104
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,464
- Yeah, okay let's go. I kept
telling him let's get on the--

105
00:04:27,464 --> 00:04:29,645
- Okay go, get on the sidewalk.

106
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,978
Oh my gosh, of course. How cute is that?

107
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:37,584
Look at him take you, that's so cute.

108
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,325
He's pushing it and everything.

109
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:44,531
Okay here's the update.

110
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:48,793
So try as I might, I could
not get the safe open

111
00:04:48,793 --> 00:04:52,507
using alternative methods,
much to my dismay.

112
00:04:52,507 --> 00:04:53,925
And, according to the internet,

113
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,111
those are pretty easy to get into

114
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,313
but I think my model is
just a little bit different

115
00:04:57,313 --> 00:04:58,490
to where it actually does matter.

116
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,339
They may have fixed a
bunch of things, you know,

117
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,395
that they were trying to
prevent in the first place.

118
00:05:03,395 --> 00:05:06,024
We took the car seats out of the van,

119
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,538
I've got my dad here to
help me get that painting.

120
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:12,676
So, first stop painting,
second stop locksmith.

121
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,401
I have to submit defeat.

122
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,523
What the heck? These darn
kids taking my parking spot

123
00:05:17,523 --> 00:05:20,933
left and right. What am I
gonna do with these guys? Jeez.

124
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:24,325
Alright I've got a bone to pick with you.

125
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,566
I've got a bone to pick with you.

126
00:05:26,566 --> 00:05:28,892
Were you driving the four-wheeler last?

127
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:30,876
Or was it Calvin?

128
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:33,134
- Me and Calvin and Mommy.

129
00:05:33,134 --> 00:05:36,884
- You all did it? You
are in my parking spot.

130
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,048
You did that on purpose!

131
00:05:41,453 --> 00:05:43,364
- Hi! I know you're excited to see me

132
00:05:43,364 --> 00:05:45,470
but I'm upset with you!

133
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,303
- Why?

134
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:48,454
- He parked in my parking spot!

135
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:50,059
- Did you hear him say "Dad's home!"

136
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,789
- [Jared] "Dad's home",
can you say "Dad's home"?

137
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,368
- [Ellie] He just does it when he wants.

138
00:05:53,368 --> 00:05:54,201
- [Jared] I know.

139
00:05:54,201 --> 00:05:55,192
- Pretzels!

140
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:56,650
- [Jared] Pretzels!

141
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,897
Hey so I've got a couple of things

142
00:05:57,897 --> 00:05:59,767
that you probably want to see.

143
00:05:59,767 --> 00:06:04,463
- When we moved into the
house my neighbor, me and her

144
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:08,630
have become friends, and I
didn't realize how beautiful

145
00:06:09,607 --> 00:06:13,152
she does these paintings.
She has this huge paint shop

146
00:06:13,152 --> 00:06:14,202
that she does in her home.

147
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:16,702
For a long time I thought
that it would be really nice

148
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,498
to add a little more color in here

149
00:06:18,498 --> 00:06:20,185
and to find something huge right there

150
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:22,369
but if you ever find a huge, huge painting

151
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,610
it is crazy amounts of money.

152
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,979
I just wanted to sit on it and
wait until I found something

153
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:29,796
and her work is beautiful,
so I had her paint me

154
00:06:29,796 --> 00:06:31,820
a huge painting for this wall.

155
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,386
Coincidence or not, it
happened to be done today

156
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,011
and it put a smile on my face,

157
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:39,265
so I'm excited to see it come in.

158
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,302
The boys and I played
outside, everyone's bathed

159
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,428
and ready for bed.
- Pretzels!

160
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:47,678
And today has been overwhelmingly good,

161
00:06:49,471 --> 00:06:53,039
everyone has been just
very sweet and tender to me

162
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,335
and I feel like I'm in such
a weird spot right now.

163
00:06:56,335 --> 00:06:58,423
I'll tell you in a
minute, they're coming in.

164
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:00,907
Let's see it! It's huge.

165
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:02,240
It's 50 x 80.

166
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,632
It's huge! That's insane!

167
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,964
That's insane! Ah she painted that!

168
00:07:11,995 --> 00:07:14,690
It took her I don't know
how long, a few weeks.

169
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,318
- Can I tell you a
secret? It's upside down.

170
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,158
- [Ellie] It's beautiful.

171
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:22,531
- Okay it was ugly before but
now that we've flipped it over

172
00:07:22,531 --> 00:07:24,527
it's much more beautiful, don't you think?

173
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,662
I think the accents are just
in all the right places.

174
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:27,758
- [Ellie] It's beautiful.

175
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:29,321
- It really, really is.

176
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:30,469
And so what we're gonna do, Dad,

177
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:31,791
if you wouldn't mind following me,

178
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:35,063
we're just gonna put it,
you can just lift it up.

179
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,911
- [Ellie] It'll go up
on that wall back there.

180
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:39,005
It's gonna be beautiful.

181
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:40,365
- Isn't that so cool?

182
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:42,677
- [Ellie] Awwww I love
her. Thanks Chelsea!

183
00:07:42,677 --> 00:07:47,105
Well that painting was beautiful
but I think what's hard

184
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:51,351
is it's like, okay, I
have about two weeks,

185
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,713
a week and a half of
you're going to miscarry,

186
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:56,329
you just don't know when.

187
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:59,058
And I think that's the hard part, is like,

188
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,833
I don't wanna go through this,

189
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,867
I don't wanna be like
crampy and laying in bed

190
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,904
and bleeding tons and
having to sit on the toilet

191
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:12,519
and achy and crying and
emotional and sad like,

192
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:15,853
I don't wanna have to do
that, but I do, I have to.

193
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:17,267
I think that's what's hard about today,

194
00:08:17,267 --> 00:08:19,451
is like this morning I was pretty crampy

195
00:08:19,451 --> 00:08:23,118
but then the rest of
the day I've been fine.

196
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:26,339
And so, yeah, not much more,

197
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,780
I even know how to say or how to express

198
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,556
just the unknown, the uncertainty

199
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:34,802
of when is what's hard, I think.

200
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:37,797
I don't know how to quite
mentally grasp that.

201
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:41,464
But I have enjoyed being
just with the kids,

202
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:46,752
just doing whatever they want, you know?

203
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:49,408
- I wanna play the popper!

204
00:08:49,408 --> 00:08:50,959
- Yeah, that's what we've done,

205
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,255
we've gone from one toy to another today.

206
00:08:53,255 --> 00:08:57,034
- [Ellie] Okay, ready? I'm
going to put 'em right here

207
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:59,498
And can you put 'em
right here on the popper?

208
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,134
Like, I'll lock 'em and
you can put 'em right there

209
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,028
- See!

210
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:07,790
- [Ellie] Okay, perfect. You
lock 'em. Put 'em right there.

211
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,152
This is scary it's gonna pop soon!

212
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:13,473
Put it on there. Wow! It popped!

213
00:09:13,473 --> 00:09:14,323
- It popped!

214
00:09:14,323 --> 00:09:16,823
- It did. Okay ready, set, go!

215
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:20,622
Make sure they're locked.

216
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,006
[jingly music]

217
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:27,637
[Cheering]

218
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:30,238
That one popped!

219
00:09:30,238 --> 00:09:33,674
Okay, that's not quite how it works

220
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,209
but they think it's fun.

221
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:36,620
Okay, you know what?

222
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,917
I think that this would
be fun for the boys

223
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:41,482
and I think it'd be fun for me to see.

224
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,950
Hey, Calvin, look at Mama.

225
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:48,167
Do you guys want to pick
some of mommy's flowers?

226
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:49,733
- Yeah!

227
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:52,916
- Okay, when I got the books yesterday,

228
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,891
they had the cutest store in town called

229
00:09:54,891 --> 00:09:57,493
Freckle Farm where I've
got a lot of my plants,

230
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,982
and they had this and I
thought that was so beautiful.

231
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:01,651
So I'm gonna let them
pick some of my flowers

232
00:10:01,651 --> 00:10:04,984
after they're done making out with this.

233
00:10:05,827 --> 00:10:07,578
Okay let's go!

234
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:08,745
[gentle music]

235
00:10:28,797 --> 00:10:32,230
- Those are so cute. They won't live long

236
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,231
but it's something fun and I think

237
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:36,487
that this little bowl is so cute.

238
00:10:36,487 --> 00:10:38,979
Especially if I were to buy
fresh flowers at the store,

239
00:10:38,979 --> 00:10:42,164
it would be perfect 'cause
they would be in there more.

240
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:44,997
But so sweet! Love them! Love you!

241
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,507
[gentle music]

242
00:11:04,174 --> 00:11:07,561
Given the circumstances,
today has actually been

243
00:11:07,561 --> 00:11:11,476
a pretty great day. We've
been together as a family

244
00:11:11,476 --> 00:11:15,146
and just spending time together
has been very, very nice.

245
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,851
And I just wanna say I'm proud of Ellie.

246
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,690
She didn't have to do anything today.

247
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:23,528
No one expected her to do anything.

248
00:11:23,528 --> 00:11:24,934
She could have laid in bed all day

249
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:28,624
and that would have been
perfectly fine and normal.

250
00:11:28,624 --> 00:11:31,069
But she didn't do that. She got up,

251
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:33,820
she got ready for the day,
she did things with us,

252
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,992
she did things with the kids, she smiled.

253
00:11:35,992 --> 00:11:38,788
We definitely had our moments
where we were sad too,

254
00:11:38,788 --> 00:11:42,245
but, like I said, all in
all, it's been a good day

255
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:46,292
with family and I'm just, I'm
proud of Ellie for everything.

256
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:48,547
I love you, Ellie. You
mean the world to me.

257
00:11:48,547 --> 00:11:51,394
And I'm so grateful that
I have you in my life.

258
00:11:51,394 --> 00:11:52,710
And not only that,

259
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,085
I just feel so overcome
with gratitude for you guys.

260
00:11:57,085 --> 00:11:59,034
You guys have been so wonderful.

261
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:01,320
All of the support that
you have been sending us

262
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,695
has just been overwhelming.
It's been so wonderful,

263
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:06,308
so thank you, guys.

264
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,540
That is where we're
gonna end the vlog today.

265
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,150
We appreciate you and
we're grateful for you.

266
00:12:11,150 --> 00:00:00,000
I love my family, and we will
see you guys tomorrow. Bye.
