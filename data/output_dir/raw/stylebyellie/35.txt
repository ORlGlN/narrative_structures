1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:03,067
- Happy Valentine's Day.

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:05,330
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,102
- Jackson, what did you wish for?

4
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:09,306
- For you and Mommy to be happy.

5
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,253
(laughter)

6
00:00:11,253 --> 00:00:12,939
- Happy Valentine's Day!

7
00:00:12,939 --> 00:00:15,253
- You know the way to my heart.

8
00:00:15,253 --> 00:00:18,649
Two years ago, my little Valentine
Day boys were right there

9
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:21,267
and this momma just made
the realization that this is

10
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:26,017
the last Valentine's Day that
is just Jackson and Calvin.

11
00:00:27,334 --> 00:00:30,560
And then next year, we'll
have little brother.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,073
You doin' okay, Cal?

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,352
Had a little rough morning?

14
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:36,608
You guys are twinners today again,

15
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,941
like you were two years ago.

16
00:00:39,818 --> 00:00:42,512
(light happy music)

17
00:00:42,512 --> 00:00:44,767
- Happy Valentine's Day.

18
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:46,979
- [Elly] What are you waiting for?

19
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:48,812
- My Valentine's card.

20
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:53,603
Daddy's getting my Valentine's card.

21
00:00:53,603 --> 00:00:56,405
- Yes! Grandma. She just got back

22
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:58,954
Her and grandpa just got back from a trip,

23
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,182
and they brought you a Valentine card.

24
00:01:01,182 --> 00:01:03,261
He's been waiting all morning to open it.

25
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:04,721
- I wanna open it.

26
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:06,668
- [Jared] Happy Valentine's Day!

27
00:01:06,668 --> 00:01:09,681
Did you know that this is from Grandma?

28
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:12,014
Look at this. There's two.

29
00:01:12,014 --> 00:01:13,757
One says Jackson,

30
00:01:13,757 --> 00:01:15,924
and the other says Calvin.

31
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:18,308
This one's for you.

32
00:01:18,308 --> 00:01:20,948
This is a giant Valentine's Day card.

33
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,906
And this one's for you.

34
00:01:22,906 --> 00:01:24,823
And then, Elly, here's ours.

35
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,039
- [Elly] I love it! She
did not have to do that.

36
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:29,057
- She did not have to do
that at all, it's so sweet.

37
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:30,736
- [Elly] Thank you. Do you
wanna open it, Jackson?

38
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,736
Turn it around. Perfect.

39
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,675
- [Elly] What! That is the biggest card.

40
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:41,258
- [Jared] Oh my gosh, ha ha ha.

41
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,443
- My dog!

42
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,353
- [Elly] Wow.

43
00:01:47,353 --> 00:01:49,990
- Is that the biggest
card you've ever seen?

44
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:53,203
- [Jared] Calvin, that
card is as big as you are.

45
00:01:53,203 --> 00:01:55,257
- [Elly] That's so big.

46
00:01:55,257 --> 00:01:56,540
- [Jared] Oh my goodness.

47
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,334
- [Elly] That was so nice of her.

48
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,091
- [Jared] That is so
sweet. Should we put these

49
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:01,291
in your piggy bank?

50
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:03,360
- [Elly] Let's see 'em.
Say thanks, Grandma!

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,376
- Thanks, Grandma. Happy Valentine's Day.

52
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:09,827
- Today is Valentine's
Day and that also means

53
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:12,110
it's my sister, Jennifer's, birthday

54
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,818
so happy birthday, Jennifer.

55
00:02:13,818 --> 00:02:14,838
I hope you're feeling well,

56
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:16,596
especially with your pregnancy

57
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,554
and your two little boys,

58
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,275
and we can't wait to see you soon.

59
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,408
- But, not just Jennifer's birthday.

60
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:25,280
It's Valentine's Day.
And here's the thing.

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,360
I have a confession to
make. We told each other

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,464
that we weren't going to be
doing anything for each other,

63
00:02:29,464 --> 00:02:30,881
but I did. I did.

64
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:35,561
- But we got each other the
coolest vacuum in the world.

65
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:37,186
That was our valentine.

66
00:02:37,186 --> 00:02:38,019
- And that's not all.

67
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,326
Why don't you come with me, Elly?

68
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:40,399
- Okay.

69
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,662
- I've got something for you,
and as we walk over this way,

70
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,496
I want you to know that I
love you very, very much.

71
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,862
And as much as we, we get to
spend so much time together,

72
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:51,616
which is so wonderful,
and it's a huge blessing,

73
00:02:51,616 --> 00:02:54,481
and I'm so grateful for that,
but there are some times

74
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:57,622
where I can't be there for
you, and it hurts my soul,

75
00:02:57,622 --> 00:03:00,855
down in the depths of my
body. So I got you something

76
00:03:00,855 --> 00:03:04,817
that would hopefully help with
that. K? You ready for this?

77
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,150
Close your eyes.

78
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:11,689
Okay. Happy Valentine's Day. You can look!

79
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,453
- I love it.

80
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:18,102
- [Jared] Do you?

81
00:03:18,102 --> 00:03:19,063
- Thank you.

82
00:03:19,063 --> 00:03:20,442
- [Jared] You're so welcome.

83
00:03:20,442 --> 00:03:22,225
Did you see it? Be honest. Did you see it?

84
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:25,092
- Being 1,000 per cent honest,
of course. I make the bed

85
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:27,159
every day. You put it right by the bed!

86
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,367
- I put it by the bed. I'm a little dumb,

87
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:33,015
but here's the thing, Elly,
you go through every square

88
00:03:33,015 --> 00:03:34,661
inch of this house,
where am I gonna hide it?

89
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:38,843
- No, I don't. I make the
bed everyday. Thank you.

90
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,753
- [Jared] Either way,
Happy Valentine's Day.

91
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,375
- Thank you. It is a massager for my neck.

92
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:48,749
I'm not gonna lie. We got
Jared's mom one for Christmas.

93
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,408
And I was borderline, like...

94
00:03:51,408 --> 00:03:53,174
- [Jared] Why didn't you get me one?

95
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:55,455
- My head hurts all the time! I want one.

96
00:03:55,455 --> 00:03:57,250
So thank you, I really appreciate it.

97
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,583
- [Jared] You're welcome. I love you.

98
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,044
- Do you wanna try it?

99
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:03,051
- [Jared] So, when you're
watching The Bachelor,

100
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:04,669
you can put that thing on and be like,

101
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:06,506
oh yeah, Jared, you're
doing a really great job.

102
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:08,449
- Let's show Jackson the demonstration.

103
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,073
You put it on your neck
and you have that to hold.

104
00:04:11,073 --> 00:04:12,506
- I want it to turn on.

105
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:14,325
- We'll turn it on and it rubs your neck,

106
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,425
and it rubs your back
and it rubs your booty.

107
00:04:16,425 --> 00:04:19,212
- Gosh, I was just counting
down the minutes until our kids

108
00:04:19,212 --> 00:04:23,792
fell asleep. Jackson and
Calvin are both asleep finally.

109
00:04:23,792 --> 00:04:24,974
Now,

110
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:25,807
hey Siri,

111
00:04:26,854 --> 00:04:28,771
play me some love jams.

112
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,845
- [Elly] Eww.

113
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,402
(laughter)

114
00:04:33,402 --> 00:04:37,184
- [Elly] What about the Greatest Showman?

115
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:38,292
- Um, yeah.

116
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,864
- [Elly] That sparks some love.

117
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:40,888
- That definitely does.

118
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:43,921
And motivation and every good
feeling in your whole body.

119
00:04:43,921 --> 00:04:48,010
- [Jared] Elly, from the
moment that I laid eyes on you,

120
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,166
for the very first time,

121
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:53,033
I knew there was something
special about you,

122
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:56,051
and that we would have some
sort of future together.

123
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,693
I didn't know exactly what it was,

124
00:04:57,693 --> 00:04:59,630
but I knew there was something special.

125
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,015
And, of course, when I
was younger and dating,

126
00:05:02,015 --> 00:05:04,362
I saw girls, and I thought
they were attractive

127
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,378
and everything, but you,

128
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:08,803
there was something different about you.

129
00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:11,713
When we were at Landon's homecoming,

130
00:05:11,713 --> 00:05:16,713
and you leaned over, and our
eyes met, my heart jolted.

131
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:19,326
- [Elly] It really was
love at first sight.

132
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:21,659
- [Jared] Absolutely. I knew

133
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:23,774
there was something special about you,

134
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:26,714
and I had to find out what it was.

135
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:31,538
And I am so grateful from the
bottom of my freaking heart

136
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:35,737
that we met, that we fell in
love and that we have these

137
00:05:35,737 --> 00:05:38,995
two, and a half, one on the way,

138
00:05:38,995 --> 00:05:41,328
boys that we made,

139
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:43,503
that our love made,

140
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:44,770
and that we get to see them grow

141
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,586
right before our very eyes.

142
00:05:46,586 --> 00:05:47,938
- We were talking in the
car, and it was like,

143
00:05:47,938 --> 00:05:51,531
it really was love at first
sight, but it wasn't like

144
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,635
from then on we just
continued to date, and it was

145
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:58,269
just Jared and I. It was
like, we kept thinking,

146
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:00,653
we had each other in our
minds and in our hearts

147
00:06:00,653 --> 00:06:03,965
as we went our separate
ways, and we came back

148
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:08,450
to each other, and it has
been easy to love you.

149
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,500
Our life has been easy
together. We have made

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,333
every situation just
happy and smooth and fun.

151
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:21,196
We've been together for
10 years! I've loved it.

152
00:06:21,196 --> 00:06:24,931
We've had some rocky
times, and it's not been

153
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:28,258
peaches 'n cream the
whole time, but I would

154
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:31,741
really say our life has
been smooth, and our love

155
00:06:31,741 --> 00:06:34,757
has been easy, and it's
been easy to communicate,

156
00:06:34,757 --> 00:06:38,779
and easy to forgive, and
it's just easy to love you.

157
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,509
- Thank you. It's easy
to love you, and I think

158
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,848
we've always said communication
is just so important,

159
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:47,881
and that's what we do is
we talk to each other.

160
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:51,648
- We talk almost too much,
but it's perfect for us.

161
00:06:51,648 --> 00:06:54,970
- Absolutely. It just blows
my mind how grateful I am

162
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:58,362
to be here with you right
now, to be where we are,

163
00:06:58,362 --> 00:07:00,986
to have our kids, to have
one on the way, to go through

164
00:07:00,986 --> 00:07:05,514
the ups and the downs with
you. I love that I have you

165
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:06,347
every day,

166
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:09,109
now and forever,

167
00:07:09,109 --> 00:07:11,217
throughout all eternity.

168
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:12,713
- [Elly] My little Jackselina.

169
00:07:12,713 --> 00:07:14,898
- [Jared] Jackson, you
look like Princess Peach!

170
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,714
- [Elly] You two twirl!

171
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:18,480
Let's see you twirl.

172
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,179
(laughter)

173
00:07:20,179 --> 00:07:22,957
- I'm building a racing car.

174
00:07:22,957 --> 00:07:25,540
(upbeat music)

175
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,580
- Okay, Jackson, here's a secret.

176
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,870
You put most of your weight
in the front of the car,

177
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:39,478
and that way, as it goes down,
it has a faster acceleration.

178
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,365
Mark Rover taught me that
at the Pinewood Derby.

179
00:07:42,365 --> 00:07:47,248
- [Elly] All right, all
three of the cars are made.

180
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:48,831
Let's see who wins.

181
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,450
Was this yours?

182
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:57,901
Daddy won!

183
00:07:59,224 --> 00:08:01,807
(upbeat music)

184
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:12,996
- I got the two biggest
bath bombs I've ever seen,

185
00:08:12,996 --> 00:08:16,517
and I can't wait to use
them in our big bathtub.

186
00:08:16,517 --> 00:08:19,100
(upbeat music)

187
00:08:22,505 --> 00:08:24,244
- [Jared] What did he wish for?

188
00:08:24,244 --> 00:08:26,726
- Jackson, what did you wish for?

189
00:08:26,726 --> 00:08:29,393
- For you and Mommy to be happy.

190
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,557
- That is so sweet, thanks, Jackson.

191
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,789
What a selfless wish, that was so nice.

192
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,263
I love you, bud. Happy Valentine's Day.

193
00:08:42,264 --> 00:08:44,089
You think that's a good wish?

194
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:44,922
Me too.

195
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:45,774
- That was cute.

196
00:08:45,774 --> 00:08:47,024
- Yeah, it was.

197
00:08:48,881 --> 00:08:51,393
- What! Did you do that?

198
00:08:51,393 --> 00:08:53,163
- [Jared] Happy Valentine's Day!

199
00:08:53,163 --> 00:08:54,482
- I love that!

200
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:55,803
- [Jared] You do?

201
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:59,377
- Look at the purple ones,
and the vases are cute.

202
00:08:59,377 --> 00:09:00,951
You bought them for me?

203
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,784
- Yes...

204
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:06,478
- They're from all my boys.

205
00:09:06,478 --> 00:09:10,479
- [Jared] They are. We each
picked out some roses for you.

206
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:12,550
When did you do that, yesterday?

207
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,051
- Yep, yesterday.

208
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:15,417
- And who delivered them?

209
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:17,122
- [Jared] It's a surprise, it's a ghost.

210
00:09:17,122 --> 00:09:18,151
- Thank you.

211
00:09:18,151 --> 00:09:20,885
- You're welcome, but that's not all!

212
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:24,603
We've got one more sweet
surprise for our sweet mom.

213
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:27,137
- Shut up, stop Jared, we said we weren't.

214
00:09:27,137 --> 00:09:30,719
- We said no, but this is something small.

215
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:33,719
Jackson, go give these to Mom, okay?

216
00:09:34,893 --> 00:09:37,154
- You know the way to my
heart. Do you guys want

217
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:38,992
to eat one in the bathtub?

218
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:39,825
- Yeah.

219
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:43,223
I'm gonna open them.

220
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:45,581
- [Jared] Happy Valentine's Day,

221
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:47,877
and your boys love you too.

222
00:09:47,877 --> 00:09:48,877
- Thank you.

223
00:09:50,564 --> 00:09:55,140
Our day has been perfect,
and then this is so sweet.

224
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,488
Thank you.

225
00:09:56,488 --> 00:09:58,863
- [Jared] You're welcome, I love you.

226
00:09:58,863 --> 00:10:00,720
- The purple are my favorite,
who picked those out?

227
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,609
- [Jared] I think Jackson
picked out the pink ones,

228
00:10:03,609 --> 00:10:05,176
Calvin picked out the purple ones,

229
00:10:05,176 --> 00:10:07,197
and I got the red ones.

230
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:09,332
We'll go take a bath and
they can have the chocolate.

231
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:11,674
This morning Jackson told
me I looked like a witch

232
00:10:11,674 --> 00:10:14,500
cause my lipstick was extra
dark and I just have been

233
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,583
telling them how cute they are to me,

234
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,515
and Jackson, what did you just say to Mom?

235
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,640
Do you remember?

236
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,406
- You're so beautiful as a witch.

237
00:10:27,406 --> 00:10:29,966
- He goes, "you're so
beautiful as a witch."

238
00:10:29,966 --> 00:10:32,581
(laughing)

239
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:35,603
- Well, at least he said I was beautiful.

240
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:38,472
Let's get ready to take a bath bomb bath.

241
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:41,555
(loud, upbeat music)

242
00:10:42,846 --> 00:10:46,842
- I love your Valentine's Day gift, Jared!

243
00:10:46,842 --> 00:10:49,770
- When Jackson made his
wish, it's like, okay,

244
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,213
there's no perfect way
to parent, half the time,

245
00:10:52,213 --> 00:10:54,394
no one really knows what
they're doing anyway.

246
00:10:54,394 --> 00:10:58,054
We're all just trying our
best and when Jackson thought

247
00:10:58,054 --> 00:11:01,658
about his mom and dad's
happiness, a little four year old,

248
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:04,755
that says a lot, and I
don't necessarily think

249
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:08,221
that's because we're good
parents, but I think it's because

250
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,257
he truly sees the connection that we have.

251
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:13,994
Like he knows that I am your everything,

252
00:11:13,994 --> 00:11:16,140
and he knows that you are my everything.

253
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,562
He sees his grandparents'
love, he sees his other

254
00:11:19,562 --> 00:11:22,241
grandparents' love, he
sees his aunts' and uncles'

255
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,755
love. I just feel like
family is very special,

256
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:29,488
and the relationships
that we make are crucial.

257
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:32,416
I feel like it's not
because of a good parenting

258
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,600
moment that we've taught
him, it's just because

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,194
of what he has seen and what he has felt.

260
00:11:37,194 --> 00:11:39,881
- Absolutely. We are not
having a difficult time

261
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:41,632
with each other right now. We're happy,

262
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,200
and he sees that we're
happy, yet he wishes

263
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,783
for more happiness.

264
00:11:47,178 --> 00:11:49,757
I think that just goes to
show the maturity of Jackson,

265
00:11:49,757 --> 00:11:51,090
a four year old.

266
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:55,748
- It almost makes me sad.
I'm like, just be four!

267
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,226
Wish for a damn dinosaur!

268
00:11:58,226 --> 00:12:00,382
(laughter)

269
00:12:00,382 --> 00:12:04,198
It is sweet and I hope
that we always remember

270
00:12:04,198 --> 00:12:07,676
that his heart is tender
and I hope we can always

271
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,816
parent well around that.

272
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:12,971
- Absolutely. Valentine's
Day is very special,

273
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:16,500
and I love it. I love that
there's a day set apart

274
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,365
for us to celebrate love
between us, between friends

275
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,936
and family and all around the world.

276
00:12:23,936 --> 00:12:26,284
I'm just glad I get to spend it with you.

277
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:27,433
- Thanks, you too.

278
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,266
- I love you.

279
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,398
- I love you, too. Happy Valentine's Day.

280
00:12:30,398 --> 00:12:32,688
- Happy Valentine's Day.

281
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:34,157
- We have some strawberries
that are covered

282
00:12:34,157 --> 00:12:36,432
in chocolate that we're
going to partake...

283
00:12:36,432 --> 00:12:38,137
- That I've one ham on.

284
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:40,186
- You deserve it, treat yourself.

285
00:12:40,186 --> 00:12:41,719
That's been the theme of the day.

286
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,284
Treat yourself, girl.

287
00:12:43,284 --> 00:12:44,787
Treat yourself, 2011.

288
00:12:44,787 --> 00:12:46,969
I think that's where we're
gonna end the vlog today.

289
00:12:46,969 --> 00:12:50,802
We are going to continue
celebrating our love.

290
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,608
- Why are you laughing?

291
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,496
- Just because...

292
00:12:56,496 --> 00:12:57,915
- Was that a joke?

293
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:58,961
- No.

294
00:12:58,961 --> 00:13:00,299
- We're gonna start a fire...

295
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:01,860
- We're gonna start a fire

296
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,575
- We're gonna start a burning fire.

297
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:05,311
- In our fire pit outside.

298
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,143
- I think we're gonna
have a fire, I think we're

299
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:08,810
gonna get in the hot tub, and we are going

300
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,763
to enjoy our night. Thank you
guys so much for watching.

301
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:15,003
I meant everything I said,
I love you, and I love

302
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,420
that we can joke together.

303
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,963
I love that we can call
each other dummies,

304
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:23,256
and I just love you,
you're my best friend.

305
00:13:23,256 --> 00:13:26,115
Thank you guys for watching, and I hope

306
00:13:26,115 --> 00:13:28,517
that you guys had a special day,

307
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,267
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

308
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,100
- Bye.

309
00:13:34,474 --> 00:00:00,000
- No seriously, why were you laughing?
