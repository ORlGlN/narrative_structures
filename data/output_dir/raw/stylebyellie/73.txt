1
00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:01,470
- We're trying to get some food down us

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,360
before church starts.

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,290
Two things, today's a special day

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,180
Jackson and Calvin,

5
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,510
well I guess that's not special,

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,579
they won't be together anymore in nursery.

7
00:00:12,579 --> 00:00:14,635
- I'm gonna be at a new class.

8
00:00:14,635 --> 00:00:17,140
- [Ellie] You're gonna
be in the Sunbeam class.

9
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:18,920
Yep, Jackson's in a new class.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,400
- He's going to go away.

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,160
- [Ellie] And Calvin, you
are gonna be in the class

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,600
and Jackson won't be there.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,660
- Yeah.

14
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,770
- Hopefully that will go smooth.

15
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,430
Jackson is going to a new class

16
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,650
and last night was your
second night together

17
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:35,510
in the same room.

18
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,240
Do you want Calvin to stay in the room

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,955
or should he have his own room?

20
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,800
- Stay in the room.

21
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,980
- [Ellie] Stay in the room?

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,135
You like sharing the room with him?

23
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:43,968
- Mmm-hmm.

24
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:44,801
- Okay.

25
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:45,720
You know what, they did awesome.

26
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,430
They did so good.

27
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,090
Again, Calvin did wake
up once, like usual.

28
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,440
And Jared put him back in bed.

29
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,900
And he did really good.

30
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,820
So I think if we keep doing that,

31
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,770
it'll go really smooth.

32
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,020
Where it used to be, if we
put him back in his bed,

33
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,780
he'd be really sad, but
because he has Jackson there,

34
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,430
I think it is just a smooth transition.

35
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,750
And I was thinking about this today.

36
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,690
So Jackson is going into a new class

37
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,980
and I feel like the age

38
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,610
between Jackson and Calvin

39
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,990
is really good for Calvin.

40
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,790
Jackson has been such a good--

41
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,450
he's just like sitting there.

42
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,650
Jackson has been such a
good example for Calvin,

43
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,440
because Jackson warmed Calvin
up to nursery at church,

44
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,050
Calvin was left alone,

45
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,710
but he knew he had his brother there,

46
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,700
that kind of warmed him up.

47
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,820
And same with just like
lots of situations.

48
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,280
Jackson will be there to help him,

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,100
and it's really nice and encouraging.

50
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,978
Hey mister.

51
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:36,811
- Hi.

52
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:38,060
- He's a little stressed,

53
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,330
trying to get stuff ready for church,

54
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:42,370
but I don't know, I just
really like their age

55
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:45,556
and I think that Jackson, you
are such a good brother, huh?

56
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:46,389
- Uh-huh.

57
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:49,060
- [Ellie] Teaching him
how to be a brother.

58
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,270
Where's your baby?

59
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,080
Who needs a baby when you have a car

60
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,240
that you can buckle?

61
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,440
- [Jackson] That's just a car.

62
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,258
- [Ellie] Oh your Batman, that works too.

63
00:01:59,258 --> 00:02:01,742
(gentle music)

64
00:02:01,742 --> 00:02:04,742
I got it in and we're all packed up.

65
00:02:08,957 --> 00:02:10,207
Pack up and go.

66
00:02:12,388 --> 00:02:13,888
- No, leave it up.

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,513
Go up.

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,690
- Okay I have to admit it,

69
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,790
I'm late for church.

70
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,623
But that's okay.

71
00:02:24,623 --> 00:02:26,930
I've been preparing for this music time

72
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,480
that I'm doing today.

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,730
And I want to show you a little bit

74
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,970
about it before I go.

75
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,250
Sorry Ellie, you have both
the kids at church right now.

76
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,030
But we have these bells that we're going

77
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,660
to be using in Primary today.

78
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,880
And there's a song that we sing

79
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,950
and we have all of the notes

80
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,930
and the colors of the bells corresponded,

81
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,070
not carols of the bells,

82
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,440
colors of the bells,

83
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,480
that corresponds with it,

84
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,434
so every time we sing this word,

85
00:02:49,434 --> 00:02:50,550
(bell rings)

86
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,930
the kids will play that song.

87
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,960
Wow, that's ringing in my ear,

88
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,930
that's pretty loud.

89
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,550
This might be pretty
hectic in Primary today

90
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,160
with all these kids and all these bells.

91
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,420
But it's gonna be a lot of fun.

92
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,380
That was my favorite thing as a kid

93
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,090
is when we did activities like this,

94
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,410
where we got up and did something,

95
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:06,559
rather than just sitting and singing,

96
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,370
getting up and doing and singing,

97
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,870
so I think that's gonna be fun.

98
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,620
We're gonna teach them a
couple more songs today,

99
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,470
so I'm pretty excited.

100
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,350
I like this project,
this calling that I have

101
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,440
in church, it's fun.

102
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,240
And now Jackson is in the
class that I'm teaching,

103
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,150
so that's gonna make it even more fun

104
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,240
and more exciting.

105
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,440
Like my little buddy's with me in class,

106
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,450
how cook is that?

107
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,360
Uh-oh, I haven't left quite yet.

108
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,130
Ellie took the kids in the car

109
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,990
and that leaves one other car,

110
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,440
but I can't find the keys.

111
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,690
So I have to scrounge the house

112
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,523
looking for the keys.

113
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,356
They're not where they normally are,

114
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,630
they're not in my coat pocket.

115
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,770
Oh jeepers.

116
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,320
What if I have to take the
four-wheeler to church?

117
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,560
That's not a bad thing.

118
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
That might be fun.

119
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,310
But it would might be very cold.

120
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,720
Oh jeez, please be in Ellie's purse.

121
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,553
Nope.

122
00:03:56,553 --> 00:03:57,850
Oh great, okay.

123
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,100
How am I gonna get to church?

124
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,210
I'll figure this out, don't worry,

125
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,630
I'll get to church somehow.

126
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,980
I gotta be there soon, uh!

127
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,250
I have scoured the entire house

128
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,730
looking for these keys.

129
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,600
And I can't find them anywhere.

130
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,200
I can't believe I'm doing this,

131
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,653
but I think I'm taking the four-wheeler

132
00:04:11,653 --> 00:04:12,986
to church today.

133
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,930
Pretty exciting, but it's
gonna be really really cold.

134
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:19,850
It's a good thing I have
this lock box on here,

135
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,360
because driving with paper like this,

136
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,830
is not the easiest or the smartest.

137
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,890
So I think everything should be safe

138
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:32,720
and sound in there, and dry.

139
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,910
That's the other key thing,

140
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,260
is that it should stay dry.

141
00:04:36,162 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

142
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,810
What an adventure we're having

143
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:40,200
and it's only Sunday.

144
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,450
(bright playful music)

145
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:52,783
(four-wheeler revving)

146
00:04:57,014 --> 00:04:59,681
(snow scraping)

147
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:06,829
(yells)

148
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:07,662
It's cold.

149
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:12,081
It's cold, but it's beautiful today.

150
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:12,977
And it's foggy.

151
00:05:12,977 --> 00:05:14,977
Oh wow, look at the fog.

152
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:18,607
Woo.

153
00:05:18,607 --> 00:05:20,298
Oh it's slippery too.

154
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:21,396
(laughs)

155
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,930
This is fun, this is exciting.

156
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,500
Oh my face is frozen,
but my hands are warm.

157
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,790
I got hand warmers on the four-wheeler,

158
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,890
so that's pretty nice.

159
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:32,970
And now we just walk
nonchalantly in to church,

160
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,460
as if nothing is different,

161
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,950
as if nothing is out of the ordinary,

162
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,750
except I'm a little bit late.

163
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,450
I didn't drive my four-wheeler to church,

164
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,610
that's absurd.

165
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,440
One nice thing about church today,

166
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,760
is that we changed times,

167
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,570
and we're at nine o'clock
instead of one o'clock,

168
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,610
so we'll be out at 12, which is nice--

169
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,320
Whoa, I was late getting to church,

170
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,462
and I'm actually late
coming home from church,

171
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:55,980
mostly because there was a truck

172
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,190
in the parking lot that thought

173
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,020
that they would just block me in,

174
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,250
so I couldn't back out.

175
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,900
So that took an extra 20 or 30 minutes

176
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,110
for me to get home.

177
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,980
I don't know if they did
it on purpose or not,

178
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,000
but they blocked me in,

179
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,040
and I couldn't ride over the front way,

180
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,290
because there was a four foot wall.

181
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,310
But we're home from church.

182
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,640
Ellie is working on her bullet journaling.

183
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,370
Why do they call it bullet journaling,

184
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,810
because this is not as
fast as a bullet, Ellie.

185
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,313
This is taking a long time.

186
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:21,790
- Well I'm doing it really slow.

187
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,623
- It looks fun.

188
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:26,050
It looks almost therapeutic

189
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,491
taking the time
- Well it's fun.

190
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:28,913
- To do it, so.
- It's fun.

191
00:06:28,913 --> 00:06:31,010
- And once I get it all sketched out,

192
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,120
it'll be easy to do.

193
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,330
I'm just making it essentially.

194
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,260
- Yeah.

195
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,440
But I wanted to tell
you about church today.

196
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,200
So you guys know that I do the music

197
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,780
and this is Jackson's time being

198
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,370
in the music class with all of the kids.

199
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,730
I was talking to all these kids,

200
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,230
I'm like this is what
we're gonna do today,

201
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,370
we're gonna sing and have so much fun.

202
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,880
I was talking to everyone

203
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,610
and Jackson was responding

204
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,920
as though I was just talking to him

205
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,450
and it was so funny.

206
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,590
Because I would say okay,

207
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,770
this is the song that we're
gonna sing today guys,

208
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,850
and Jackson says,

209
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,410
Dad I don't want to sing that song.

210
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,410
And everyone, all the teachers,

211
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:07,010
are laughing like crazy.

212
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,290
And then we have these bells

213
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,380
that I was showing you earlier

214
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,580
and Jackson, it's so funny,

215
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,320
he always says how time,
instead of what time.

216
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,640
And he says how time are
we gonna play these bells?

217
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,740
Like what time are we gonna
play these bells, Dad?

218
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,010
And everyone is just
bursting out laughing.

219
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,940
It was so fun

220
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,050
but all in all,

221
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,530
I think the kids had a
really great time at church

222
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,160
in their new classes today.

223
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,830
I have fun teaching the kids.

224
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,020
Let's go ask 'em.

225
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,738
Hey Jackson, did you have
fun in your class today?

226
00:07:31,738 --> 00:07:32,571
- Yeah.

227
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:33,404
- [Jared] Yeah?

228
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:35,270
What was your favorite
part about class today?

229
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,309
- Singing.

230
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:39,570
- Ah, I didn't even have to tell you

231
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,810
to say that!

232
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:44,180
You're my favorite first-born son.

233
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:48,262
Calvin, did you have fun at church today?

234
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:49,095
- Yeah.

235
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:49,928
- [Jared] Yeah?

236
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,310
What was your favorite part?

237
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,010
Was singing your favorite part?

238
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:53,843
- Yes.

239
00:07:53,843 --> 00:07:55,830
- Oh, it was.

240
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,060
Oh you're my favorite second-born son.

241
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,220
I love you.

242
00:08:02,069 --> 00:08:03,069
- Whoa, Dad?

243
00:08:05,825 --> 00:08:06,658
(drill whirring)

244
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:08,100
- Is that pretty cool?

245
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,810
- [Ellie] Whoa, we are getting ready

246
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,718
for somebody's birthday.

247
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:14,190
- Yeah.
- My birthday!

248
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,030
- Who's?

249
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,863
- Mine.

250
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:16,696
- Yours?

251
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,322
- [Ellie] Are you gonna be three?

252
00:08:18,322 --> 00:08:19,249
- Mine.
- No four.

253
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,580
- Four?

254
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,190
Holy cow.

255
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,120
We are getting ready
for Jackson's birthday.

256
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,020
We are wanting to make sure

257
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,630
that the basement is tidied.

258
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:31,020
These chairs have been loose
for a really long time,

259
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,940
so Jared's getting the drill out.

260
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,370
Just getting everything situated.

261
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,663
We have a birthday on Tuesday.

262
00:08:37,663 --> 00:08:39,990
- I feel like we have
a brand new basement.

263
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,870
Like I went through the
entertainment center

264
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,510
and cleaned everything out,

265
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,581
worked on all the cords in the back,

266
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:47,560
- Amazing.
- it just feels good.

267
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,890
- [Ellie] I'm sorry, but the more things

268
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,510
you put by Penny,

269
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,768
she's not gonna eat.

270
00:08:52,768 --> 00:08:54,410
- [Jared] Don't put it past her Ellie,

271
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,310
she may eat that metal thing.

272
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,830
Calvin, he keeps going
and grabbing random stuff,

273
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,650
putting it by her.

274
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,960
And then touching her
head, so she'll eat it.

275
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,250
First off I have to give you guys

276
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,780
a huge thank you.

277
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,320
When Jared asked you guys to participate

278
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,950
in the survey last week,

279
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,993
it really meant a lot to us,

280
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:16,180
because we really want to know what you

281
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,380
want to see in the vlogs.

282
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,910
And we have some ideas
of what we want to do,

283
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,490
but it also helps to have an actual survey

284
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,970
of the amount of people
that want to see this

285
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,200
or don't want to see this.

286
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,520
I'm sorry Jared,

287
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,610
no one voted for the tech and reviews,

288
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,540
but I told him, if he
still wants to do it,

289
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,050
he really should, because
that's the point of the vlog.

290
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,690
But we just know what you
guys would rather see.

291
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,180
And we definitely take into consideration

292
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,610
what you guys want to see when we do film.

293
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,170
So really thank you so much

294
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,130
for filling that out,

295
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,860
which kind of leads in to this.

296
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,470
A lot of people have been saying,

297
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,430
Ellie do a video on your bullet journaling

298
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,370
and I just want to sit down a few minutes

299
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:57,600
and talk about my bullet journaling.

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,670
And what I've been doing,

301
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,204
and also with the vlogs,

302
00:10:01,204 --> 00:10:05,630
I used to feel like oh I
don't want to sit and talk

303
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,450
for four or five minutes,

304
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,180
because then that's like half the vlog,

305
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,380
and I want to take myself
out of that mindset

306
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,210
of a vlog has to be every
day, morning to night.

307
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,950
Maybe in the morning I want to get ready,

308
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,860
maybe I want to talk about my nails,

309
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,629
maybe I just want to talk about the kids.

310
00:10:23,629 --> 00:10:26,120
It's a weird thing that I've put on myself

311
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,770
and maybe it's just
because I've watched vlogs,

312
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,100
so I think oh this is the
way maybe we should follow,

313
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,840
but I definitely want to
take into consideration

314
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,420
this year, because so
many changes are coming,

315
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,940
baby is coming.

316
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,790
My energy might totally plummet,

317
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,930
it already has,

318
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:42,860
but I've enjoyed it.

319
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,853
I've really enjoyed just--

320
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,150
I'm kind of a homebody,

321
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,510
so I like that, but--

322
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,570
Yeah, bullet journaling, so
many people have asked about it.

323
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,270
I am a beginner.

324
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,830
If you guys really want
to watch videos on it,

325
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,230
YouTube it up guys.

326
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,900
So many people have so
many awesome suggestions

327
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,850
on how-tos, but I'm just gonna give you

328
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,630
a little bit of what I've been doing.

329
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,480
First, I ordered this from Amazon.

330
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,647
I also saw it at Hobby
Lobby the other day,

331
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,780
it's Hand Lettering 101.

332
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,900
I've showed you guys,

333
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,770
a lot of people have
asked where we've got it.

334
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,150
And then so many guys have
tweeted me pictures of you,

335
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,557
and yours, this is some of my drawing.

336
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:25,030
It's seriously been so fun for me

337
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,320
to sit at night,

338
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,300
and just focus on something, not my phone,

339
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,240
but just drawing, it
really been therapeutic.

340
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,220
But my goal for the last few years

341
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,040
is to do better at my handwriting

342
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,970
and I feel like this is the start of it.

343
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,560
Bullet journaling in a sense is,

344
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,830
you make your own planner / journal,

345
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,450
instead of buying one that's
already sketched out for you.

346
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,370
It's very what you want in your planner.

347
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,780
And I love planners, I have to have them.

348
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,450
And every planner is so different,

349
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,030
like I said, do what works for you.

350
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,360
And I'm not artistic.

351
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,670
But this is my first page,

352
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,990
it's my goals for the year

353
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,670
and my goal is peace,

354
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,830
I just want to feel
very peaceful this year.

355
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,950
And feel peace at my decisions or yeah,

356
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,160
so peace is that.

357
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,600
And then I have (laughs),

358
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,570
this is called the future log.

359
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,410
Because what happens if the family says

360
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,120
hey, there's a family reunion in July,

361
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,120
but I don't write out my full year

362
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,260
in the bullet journal.

363
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,010
So this is just a future log,

364
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,180
where it can say,

365
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,570
oh this is the days,

366
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,850
like we have a cooking day
on the 17th of January,

367
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,120
so I write that down.

368
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,330
So it's just things
that you can write down

369
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,380
ahead of time so you can look back on

370
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,410
and know what's going on.

371
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,080
I have a video file.

372
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,920
I have some really fun plans

373
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,270
for my channel that you
guys are going to see

374
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,952
at the very end of the month.

375
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:50,080
When I went to China,

376
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,200
a lot of things that happened there

377
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,790
are going to come to fruition,

378
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:57,360
a lot of my knowledge is coming out,

379
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,610
that I've been working on.

380
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,450
So I'm definitely gonna
be doing more videos.

381
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,150
They may not quite be like

382
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,766
what I've been doing in the past,

383
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:08,050
but I'm really excited for that.

384
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,792
And then so far I have,

385
00:13:10,792 --> 00:13:13,540
right after that is my week.

386
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,880
So this is a movable tab, that I'll move

387
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,330
when I have a new week.

388
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,840
Okay, I am so learning.

389
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,584
I thought Jackson was turning three.

390
00:13:20,584 --> 00:13:21,417
(laughs)

391
00:13:21,417 --> 00:13:22,630
So I was like three plus one.

392
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,830
Okay so this is my week ahead.

393
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,060
This week I don't have much on there.

394
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,480
I have a chiropractor appointment,

395
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,750
I have a doctor appointment.

396
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,120
So that's that week and
then I have the next week

397
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,430
of January 14th to the 20th,

398
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,870
again I have a photo shoot,

399
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,220
then I have a cookbook
day with the family.

400
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,180
Yeah, so pretty much

401
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,480
I'm just writing out the weeks as I go.

402
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,290
Some people have a month
that they write out

403
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,220
and then the weeks, but
I don't want to do that,

404
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,510
because I already have
the months written down

405
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,610
to reflect back.

406
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,570
So really it's just
what you want it to be.

407
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:53,660
It's therapeutic.

408
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,690
It's fun, it's my goal to
get better handwriting.

409
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,590
So it's been fun to just sit

410
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,290
and take my time.

411
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,810
And I've really enjoyed it.

412
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,650
I think it's gonna be really fun for me.

413
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,880
It's been fun with the kids.

414
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,210
They just see me sitting.

415
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,020
And I'm like this is what
I'm doing for the hour kids,

416
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,120
and so I end up pulling their stuff out

417
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,530
and they color and draw,

418
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,540
and run around the house

419
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,420
and watch shows.

420
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,460
So everything that I got for myself,

421
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,180
I also got from Amazon.

422
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,370
So I looked up a lot of books

423
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,520
of what people use.

424
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,270
And know even gonna know how to say it,

425
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,608
the Lechtrum?

426
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:26,730
Leuchtturm book?

427
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:27,563
I don't know.

428
00:14:27,563 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm gonna have everything
that I've used so far

429
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,290
in the description, but
if you guys use stuff

430
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,640
that you think I need, let me know.

431
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,420
That is just a little life update

432
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,670
and my favorite thing that
I've been into lately.

433
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,420
Thank you guys so much for asking

434
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,380
and wanting to hear about it for so long.

435
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,750
Like I said, I'm a newbie.

436
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,120
There are some really fun people

437
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,400
that actually do painting

438
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
and they put their paints in here.

439
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,890
So many fun things.

440
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,180
Like I said I'm not artistic.

441
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,360
My goal is just to be very simple

442
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,450
and then when I get into
it and feel comfortable,

443
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,430
then I'll get on the artsy side.

444
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,390
But for now, I'm not gonna do that.

445
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,440
So that's what I have.

446
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,460
Thank you guys so much for watching.

447
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,790
We really appreciate it.

448
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,880
I love what we do.

449
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,590
I think this is so fun.

450
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,010
You kids, you guys are done for the day.

451
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,843
Jared I called you kids,

452
00:15:09,843 --> 00:15:10,676
because I'm used to saying kids.

453
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:11,810
- It's okay, I'm happy to get on playing--

454
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,470
- [Ellie] You guys are done for the day.

455
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,330
Penny girl.

456
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,146
- She's been so good for us today.

457
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:18,480
- You've been good the last few days.

458
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,786
Last week was a little crazy and rough,

459
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,264
(laughs)

460
00:15:22,264 --> 00:15:23,720
it was just a little crazy and rough,

461
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,450
but she's been so good this week.

462
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:27,200
It's like kids, one week they're good,

463
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,630
one week they're crazy.

464
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,770
So thank you guys so much for watching

465
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,070
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

466
00:15:33,070 --> 00:00:00,000
Jackson's birthday week guys!
- Woo!
