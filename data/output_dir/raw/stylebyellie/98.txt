1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,004
- You're the nicest mom, ever!

2
00:00:03,004 --> 00:00:03,945
(Ellie laughing)

3
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:05,704
- [Jared] See? That was
painless, you did so good,

4
00:00:05,704 --> 00:00:07,892
Penny girl, I'm so proud of you!

5
00:00:07,892 --> 00:00:09,430
- [Ellie] Jared is bullet journaling!

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,263
- What?

7
00:00:10,263 --> 00:00:14,551
- Don't peek, I don't
want you to see this!

8
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,801
(Laughing)

9
00:00:19,732 --> 00:00:21,014
- Good morning, guys!

10
00:00:21,014 --> 00:00:23,421
Today is going to be exciting,

11
00:00:23,421 --> 00:00:26,731
we have boxes on boxes
on boxes, and packages

12
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:31,469
on packages, and we have
presents under the tree,

13
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,102
we have so much stuff around
the house and it is time to

14
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:38,695
ship those off to our family
and friends and to give to

15
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:40,611
those who are in need.

16
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:42,827
Ellie and I have been planning
this for quite some time now,

17
00:00:42,827 --> 00:00:46,165
as far as giving, these
things that are under our

18
00:00:46,165 --> 00:00:49,433
giving tree, and these
presents of family and friends

19
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,266
for a while now.

20
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:53,824
We also have our Reddit Secret
Santa gift that we have to

21
00:00:53,824 --> 00:00:55,216
ship out today, too.

22
00:00:55,216 --> 00:00:59,449
So today is all about getting
ready for Christmas, and

23
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,008
getting into the Christmas
spirit even more than we

24
00:01:02,008 --> 00:01:03,008
already are.

25
00:01:04,416 --> 00:01:08,764
Despite our Christmas
tree not being decorated.

26
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:10,798
I'm not sure if Ellie
talked about that or not,

27
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:13,486
but one thing she said was
like, I really just like it with

28
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:18,337
the lights on, so, that is up
in the air if we will decorate

29
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:19,778
it or just keep it with the lights on.

30
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:22,251
It is really pretty with just
the lights on, not gonna lie.

31
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:24,997
But we'll see, I don't know.
It might be decorated, it may

32
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:27,973
not be, we'll find out in
the future, and so will you.

33
00:01:27,973 --> 00:01:30,065
Stay tuned for the next
episode of Ellie and Jared,

34
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:31,671
where we decide if we're gonna decorate.

35
00:01:31,671 --> 00:01:32,712
Nah, I'm not gonna do that.

36
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:36,640
Penny, come here, get in your
place, get in your place.

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,603
Good girl!

38
00:01:37,603 --> 00:01:39,927
I've got some good news
and I've got some bad news.

39
00:01:39,927 --> 00:01:43,945
The bad news is that Penny
the other day, she got her

40
00:01:43,945 --> 00:01:48,028
toenail snagged... snugged...
snatched... tugged,

41
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:53,511
well she got her toenail
caught on something, and it

42
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:56,187
fractured part of her toenail.
Not her toe, her toenail.

43
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:58,103
So we had to take her to
the vet and they got it all

44
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:01,005
taken care of and they
bandaged it up really nicely.

45
00:02:01,005 --> 00:02:05,235
And the good news is, it
is time to take it off.

46
00:02:05,235 --> 00:02:07,593
Are you ready for that?
You're such a good girl,

47
00:02:07,593 --> 00:02:08,991
yes you are, Penny!

48
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,396
So I'm gonna have to find a
way to get this bandage off.

49
00:02:11,396 --> 00:02:13,582
Penny's actually been
really, really good with it.

50
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:16,166
When she first got the bandage
on, she was trying to nip

51
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,449
at it and everything like that,
but she over time has just

52
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:20,777
got used to it and didn't bite at it.

53
00:02:20,777 --> 00:02:22,291
We're gonna have to keep on
a really, really close eye

54
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,694
on her when we take the bandage
off, so she's not licking it

55
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:26,896
and that sort of thing.

56
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,533
But yeah, she's been a really
good girl with it, so I think

57
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:29,854
it'll be pretty easy.

58
00:02:29,854 --> 00:02:31,629
'Kay, Penny, come on, let's
go, get in your place!

59
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:32,462
- [Spongebob Narrator] Later.

60
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:33,324
- Well that was painless!

61
00:02:33,324 --> 00:02:36,786
Look, and we got this cute
little bootie from it.

62
00:02:36,786 --> 00:02:40,275
I always think those little
booties on dogs is the

63
00:02:40,275 --> 00:02:41,430
cutest thing ever.

64
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,251
See? That was painless, you
did so good Penny girl, I'm

65
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:45,778
so proud of you!

66
00:02:45,778 --> 00:02:47,883
- [Ellie] Guys! Jared
is bullet journaling!

67
00:02:47,883 --> 00:02:50,132
- What? Is that what I'm doing?

68
00:02:50,132 --> 00:02:52,314
- [Ellie] You are! That's
called bullet journaling!

69
00:02:52,314 --> 00:02:54,422
- What? Tell me what the difference is.

70
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:55,542
- [Ellie] He came up to me
and he's like Ellie, I need a

71
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,355
calendar for dates, he
needs to like look at dates.

72
00:02:58,355 --> 00:03:00,412
He's like other than my
phone, I need to like have it

73
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:01,245
written down.

74
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:02,792
- [Jared] I like to write them
out, you know what I mean?

75
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:05,472
- And I said, I have my planner
right there, which only has

76
00:03:05,472 --> 00:03:07,656
like one more month of the year,

77
00:03:07,656 --> 00:03:11,028
and then I'm gonna
start bullet journaling.

78
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:11,929
Woo, 'scuse you!

79
00:03:11,929 --> 00:03:13,512
- Cover your mouth!

80
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,828
- [Ellie] And then I came
in here and Jared's like,

81
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:18,076
writing everything down and
had bullet points, notes,

82
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:19,904
and I'm like, hey,
you're bullet journaling.

83
00:03:19,904 --> 00:03:20,737
- Yes, I am.

84
00:03:20,737 --> 00:03:23,026
- [Ellie] We're a bullet
journaling family, now, woohoo!

85
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:27,196
- I take after you, in the
best way possible. Whoa.

86
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:28,140
- [Ellie] Excuse me!

87
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,244
- What do you say, young man?

88
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:30,244
- Excuse me.

89
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,035
- [Ellie] Okay. It's not nice
to burp in people's faces.

90
00:03:34,035 --> 00:03:35,268
- There you go.

91
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:36,773
No, especially when it's smelly.

92
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:37,606
(Ellie laughing)

93
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:38,842
Back to my bullet journaling,
please, can I have some

94
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:41,743
privacy while I bullet journal,
journal all the bullets?

95
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:46,262
- [Ellie] 'Kay, close
your eyes, I'm coming in.

96
00:03:46,262 --> 00:03:47,512
Ooh, it's cold!

97
00:03:48,607 --> 00:03:50,927
I took the kids with me and
we were gone for a few hours

98
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:53,785
this morning going
Christmas shopping for Dad.

99
00:03:53,785 --> 00:03:56,960
And he is going to love
it, he is going to love it!

100
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,253
And I think you guys will,
too but you'll have to wait

101
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:00,755
till Christmas because I
can't show you, cause then

102
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:03,014
Jared will see it, cause
he edits, you know?

103
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,512
So anyway, really fun.

104
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,917
Close your eyes!

105
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:07,696
- [Jared] I'm sitting over
here to avoid any suspicious

106
00:04:07,696 --> 00:04:10,029
activity! My back is to you!

107
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:13,292
- Why do you call it duct tape?

108
00:04:13,292 --> 00:04:15,368
- Because it is duct tape!

109
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:16,747
- Who taught you that?

110
00:04:16,747 --> 00:04:17,685
- I don't know.

111
00:04:17,685 --> 00:04:18,793
(Ellie laughs)

112
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,979
- 'Kay, come over here.

113
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,980
- 'Kay, can I do, can I do it still?

114
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,745
Can I help you with this part still?

115
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:30,745
- Yes. Let me get it nice and ready.

116
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:33,960
- I wanna do the duct tape.

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,423
- 'Kay, we're not using duct
tape, but you can help me

118
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:40,090
with this tape. Go right
here in the middle.

119
00:04:41,775 --> 00:04:45,608
'Kay, you did a good
job. Now one on this end.

120
00:04:53,014 --> 00:04:53,847
Perfect.

121
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,130
Now one right here.

122
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,963
- 'Kay.

123
00:05:00,218 --> 00:05:01,089
Right here?

124
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:04,128
- Yeah, thank you. That's perfect.

125
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:05,982
See now it all stays.

126
00:05:05,982 --> 00:05:09,815
- You're the best, you're
the nicest mom ever.

127
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,115
- Did you say that cause I
just turned the camera on?

128
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:14,948
- Uh huh.

129
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,510
(Ellie laughs)

130
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,200
- Jackson literally just hugged
me and was like, "you're the

131
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,206
nicest mom", and I was like,
how come I didn't catch that?

132
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,528
And then the moment I turned
it on, he said it, just because

133
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,861
I said that. You are cute, that's funny.

134
00:05:30,304 --> 00:05:32,631
- You smell stinky.

135
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:33,840
- I smell stinky?

136
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,726
- Yeah.

137
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:35,806
- No I don't!

138
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:37,689
- Yes, you do.

139
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:38,536
- You do.

140
00:05:38,536 --> 00:05:40,153
- Nuh, uh, you do!

141
00:05:40,153 --> 00:05:42,263
- 'Kay, hold the tape, right here.

142
00:05:42,263 --> 00:05:43,846
- Okay. Right here?

143
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,099
- No, right here. Right there.

144
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:52,276
You know, I admit when I'm
stinky, but I know I'm not right

145
00:05:52,276 --> 00:05:54,599
now, that's why I'm a little offended.

146
00:05:54,599 --> 00:05:57,426
This looks great. I mean some
of the box you see, but it's

147
00:05:57,426 --> 00:06:00,062
such a big box that...

148
00:06:00,062 --> 00:06:02,743
'Kay, so we're gonna make
sure we wrap it really good.

149
00:06:02,743 --> 00:06:04,021
- 'Kay.

150
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,475
- Cause Daddy likes to peek.

151
00:06:06,475 --> 00:06:07,562
- Yeah.

152
00:06:07,562 --> 00:06:09,656
- And that's naughty.

153
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:11,833
- [Jared] Are you guys talking about me?

154
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:16,000
- [Jackson] No! Don't peek,
I don't want you to see this!

155
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:18,678
- [Jared] What is it?

156
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,511
- Nothing!

157
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:20,448
(Jared laughs)

158
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,865
Don't look at it!

159
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,613
- [Jared] Okay, you're a good
boy, you know that, Jackson?

160
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:26,446
- Yeah.

161
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:29,933
- [Jared] You're a good helper for mommy.

162
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,407
That's a big box, Ellie!

163
00:06:31,407 --> 00:06:33,171
- [Ellie] Don't be
deceived of what's in it.

164
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:35,546
- Okay, I won't because the
box that you're getting is not

165
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:36,894
nearly that size.

166
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,239
- [Ellie] Hey, I like little
tiny boxes with diamonds in 'em

167
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:40,482
- It's a little bigger than that!

168
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,443
- It's diamonds!

169
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,941
- [Ellie] That's what
we got you, is diamonds!

170
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:47,498
- You know what you are?
A diamond in the rough!

171
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:48,581
Like Aladdin.

172
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:52,269
- I'm not a diamond. You're a diamond.

173
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,257
- Shinin' bright like a diamond!

174
00:06:54,257 --> 00:06:56,213
Okay, scratch everything
that I said earlier, well not

175
00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:58,132
everything, just this
one piece of information.

176
00:06:58,132 --> 00:07:01,499
Ellie has made it clear that
she wants to decorate the tree.

177
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,615
We had one clip where you said,
"No I'm just going to leave

178
00:07:03,615 --> 00:07:06,342
the lights up", and I said
maybe she doesn't want to

179
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,333
decorate, and now you say
you do want to decorate.

180
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,823
- Well here's the thing, I
don't want to. Well I want to,

181
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:15,666
my heart wants to. My
mind and energy says no.

182
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,501
- [Jared] Well, maybe...

183
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:19,883
- And (mumbles). The kids have
loved having our little tree

184
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:20,716
in our room.

185
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:21,664
- [Jared] Yeah.

186
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:23,557
- Cause they helped decorate
that, and they loved it.

187
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:25,727
But, then I'm gonna be sad
if I don't decorate the tree,

188
00:07:25,727 --> 00:07:26,768
I have to decorate the tree.

189
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:30,498
- Right. What if you sat on
the couch, and you told me

190
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:34,196
where you wanted things to
go, and I decorated it under

191
00:07:34,196 --> 00:07:38,255
your direction? That way you
have your energy and your mind

192
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:39,994
and I'm the brute force
that makes it happen.

193
00:07:39,994 --> 00:07:41,895
- Did you read comments or something?

194
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,917
- [Jared] No! I did not,
this was out of the kindness

195
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:46,084
of my heart.

196
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:47,120
- That's a good idea.

197
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,241
- You like that idea? Only
if I get a kiss out of it.

198
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:55,408
- That's new, why haven't
I fallen asleep (mumbles)

199
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:00,381
- [Jared] You know, there's a
few things I wish I could do

200
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,755
as well as you can, and
one of them is wrapping

201
00:08:02,755 --> 00:08:03,895
Christmas presents.

202
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:07,134
- You know, I wanna be as good
at wrapping presents as my

203
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:07,967
brother Beau.

204
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:10,681
- [Jared] I was just gonna say Beau, too!

205
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:11,708
- He's the best!

206
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,811
- [Jared] He's so stinkin' good at it.

207
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:15,224
- My mom is really good. I am not good.

208
00:08:15,224 --> 00:08:16,766
I'm good at making it look
like crap, but covering it.

209
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,730
I'm good at covering up stuff.

210
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,181
- [Jared] You're good
at covering up the crap?

211
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:24,802
- Yeah, but I'm not good at,
I'm better than I used to be.

212
00:08:24,802 --> 00:08:29,615
- My mom is like, do you need
that wrapped? Here it is,

213
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:33,782
with a bow on top, and a
cherry and garland and...

214
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:37,554
Silver lining. What else do
you put on top of things to

215
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,108
make it look pretty?

216
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:42,618
We are just wrapping gifts, and
time has gotten away from us

217
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:44,532
the time is much further than we thought.

218
00:08:44,532 --> 00:08:47,186
So we're not gonna to be able
to send all of these out today

219
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:49,514
but, we still have time before Christmas.

220
00:08:49,514 --> 00:08:52,492
So, it is okay, it is
fine, change of plans.

221
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:55,575
We have some other things that
we need to celebrate today,

222
00:08:55,575 --> 00:08:58,210
and we are getting to that,
as soon as we're done wrapping

223
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,052
these gifts.

224
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,674
- Yes, we, this is actually Bryan's gift.

225
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,830
- [Jared] Aw, Bryan and Missy!

226
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,428
I really hope they like it.

227
00:09:07,428 --> 00:09:08,694
- I tried to wrap Cullen and
Katie's and I was getting

228
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:12,641
impatient, and so I need to
add another box for that.

229
00:09:12,641 --> 00:09:13,831
You wanna know what we're celebrating?

230
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,965
- [Jared] Well, I think so.
I already know, these guys

231
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:17,798
are a little in the dark.

232
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,946
- We're celebrating my sweet
baby boy, guys, I can't

233
00:09:20,946 --> 00:09:22,279
even believe it.

234
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:25,882
But tonight we're not
celebrating my boy, tonight we're

235
00:09:25,882 --> 00:09:27,465
celebrating my dad's 60th birthday.

236
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:29,000
- [Jared] Are you a little
scatterbrained right now?

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,929
- No I wasn't just saying like,
I have been thinking about

238
00:09:31,929 --> 00:09:32,929
him nonstop.

239
00:09:34,269 --> 00:09:35,844
- At this point, I don't know
if you're talking about your

240
00:09:35,844 --> 00:09:36,883
dad or the baby.

241
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:41,050
- I'm talking about Beau,
okay? Let me wrap my presents!

242
00:09:42,723 --> 00:09:45,972
Well I got my dad a gift, and
then I got him another gift

243
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:48,092
because I thought this would
be cool to get, and then

244
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:52,811
Calvin ruined this gift. My
bedroom smells like pooper-ie.

245
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:55,023
And my bathroom is covered in pooper-ie.

246
00:09:55,023 --> 00:09:58,315
One of them got lost and then
this one, he sprayed about

247
00:09:58,315 --> 00:10:02,047
15 times as if it was perfume
and he ripped the box. So Dad,

248
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,577
- [Jared] It doesn't really
smell that bad, though.

249
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:07,289
- [Ellie] It smells amazing,
but it doesn't belong

250
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:10,266
in my carpet. So that's for
Dad, cause I think one time

251
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,480
he's like, I've never tried that.

252
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,718
I'm like, you've never tried
pooper-ie? You have to get it.

253
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:17,808
I would be a sponsor for
pooper-ie if they wanted me to be.

254
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,671
Hi Bonnie and Joel!

255
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:21,622
Joelie is back there
somewhere, there you are.

256
00:10:21,622 --> 00:10:22,455
- I'm in the dark.

257
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,204
- Smile, so I can see your teeth!

258
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,721
We're on our way for
Dad's 60th birthday party!

259
00:10:28,721 --> 00:10:31,723
- Happy birthday, old man,
hope you have a great one!

260
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:33,301
- [Ellie] He doesn't
know that we're coming.

261
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:35,148
- It's a surprise, kinda!

262
00:10:35,148 --> 00:10:37,722
- Yeah, it's just Mom said
"adults only", we're gonna get

263
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,290
food, we're gonna hang
out with Dad, tell him

264
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,195
how much we love him.
Give him lots of gifts

265
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:43,204
cause that's his favorite
thing in the world

266
00:10:43,204 --> 00:10:44,037
is to get gifts.

267
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:45,469
- [Jared] Did you get Depends? For Dad?

268
00:10:45,469 --> 00:10:47,263
- [Ellie] You're such a jerk.

269
00:10:47,263 --> 00:10:49,097
- We have to stop by Walmart
real quick, I hope you

270
00:10:49,097 --> 00:10:50,037
guys are okay with that.

271
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:53,230
- Jared did wanna get Dad
a cane, like as a gag gift,

272
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,123
but he didn't.

273
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:57,311
- It's like those old, like,
over the hill canes that

274
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:01,001
have like a honker on it, a
reflector, a rear-view mirror

275
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,638
and those type of things, you know?

276
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,971
It's a gag gift. It's a gag!

277
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:07,983
Hi.

278
00:11:09,349 --> 00:11:13,516
- [Ellie] Dad's on the couch,
on Instagram, probably.

279
00:11:14,918 --> 00:11:16,077
Should I walk in?

280
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:18,327
Happy birthday! Happy 60th!

281
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,104
- [Jared] Happy Birthday to you!

282
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:24,606
- [Ellie] Were you checking
Instagram seeing if

283
00:11:24,606 --> 00:11:26,921
we posted a picture of you?

284
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:29,407
- I tried getting my post
up as early in the day

285
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,714
as I could.

286
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:32,881
- Well, I've been looking.

287
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,653
- [Ellie] I wanna make one
of these with the kids.

288
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:39,735
- Hello, my name is Mister
Snowman, no I don't what a

289
00:11:39,735 --> 00:11:42,818
snowman is (mumbles)

290
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,652
- [Ellie] Why do you have
the camera down there?

291
00:11:51,652 --> 00:11:53,569
- I just turned it off.

292
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,670
- This is for Chad.

293
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:02,643
- [Ellie] We were just talkin' about you.

294
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:08,630
So who counted the
candles? Did Dad or Mom?

295
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,000
- [Bonnie] Mom said she walked in on him

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,353
putting the candles together.

297
00:12:12,353 --> 00:12:14,252
- [Jared] Like little teepees?

298
00:12:14,252 --> 00:12:15,631
- [Ellie] Well he did it so
the kids would think it's cute,

299
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:18,849
and then the kids didn't come
and then Dad was sad about it.

300
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,544
- [Jared] Well, it's also
efficient, so you only have to do

301
00:12:20,544 --> 00:12:22,545
one light on the teepees.

302
00:12:22,545 --> 00:12:24,095
- [Ellie] That's cute!

303
00:12:24,095 --> 00:12:25,943
- [Jennifer] Anybody
wanna help him light 'em?

304
00:12:25,943 --> 00:12:27,162
- [Ellie] Eh, we'll watch.

305
00:12:27,162 --> 00:12:29,060
- [Julie] He looks like
he's doing pretty good.

306
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,610
- [Jennifer] My Dad would be having a fit.

307
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,599
- [Joel] He's turning 60, not 80.

308
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:35,599
(Everyone chatting)

309
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:45,217
- [Jared] Firepower!

310
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:47,467
(Laughing)

311
00:12:58,187 --> 00:13:02,354
♪Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to you!♪

312
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:09,409
♪Happy Birthday dear Dad,
Happy Birthday to you♪

313
00:13:15,331 --> 00:13:18,748
- [Jared] And then the house burned down.

314
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,741
- [Ellie] Come on!

315
00:13:29,229 --> 00:13:30,562
I'm embarrassed!

316
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,091
(cheering)

317
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:39,469
- Well that was a little intense.

318
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:44,293
- Well there's no little kids
to like put their finger or

319
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,846
blow it out with him.

320
00:13:45,846 --> 00:13:48,929
- Dad, what does the cake smell like?

321
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:58,159
- [Ellie] Every year. For
18 years. I've got that.

322
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,826
- We are having a...

323
00:14:00,814 --> 00:14:03,564
(Cheerful music)

324
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,281
- Ready? One, two three!

325
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:19,114
- Happy Birthday!

326
00:14:19,114 --> 00:14:20,892
- Happy Birthday, Dad! If you
guys don't know, I'm actually

327
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:23,777
holding my phone and taking
pictures at the same time.

328
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:26,244
I'm pretty amazing, ha-ha!

329
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,474
We're back home and we're
going to call it a night,

330
00:14:28,474 --> 00:14:29,854
the tree is still not decorated.
Still deciding on that,

331
00:14:29,854 --> 00:14:33,914
we'll let you know. We had
so much fun at Ellie parent's

332
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,627
house. We laughed and we all
laughed so hard and it just

333
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:41,772
felt so good to belly laugh
and just have a good time with

334
00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:44,669
family. So I hope you guys
enjoyed your time with your

335
00:14:44,669 --> 00:14:48,714
family, with friends, with
neighbors, your community,

336
00:14:48,714 --> 00:14:52,238
this entire Christmas and holiday season.
