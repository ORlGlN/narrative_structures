1
00:00:00,296 --> 00:00:01,206
- Alright.

2
00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:02,406
(laughs)

3
00:00:02,406 --> 00:00:05,379
I ran and grabbed the camera.

4
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:06,529
It is five in the morning

5
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:08,466
and I am so mad at myself,

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:11,752
I've been up since one, cannot sleep.

7
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:13,329
And I don't know if it's jet lag or not,

8
00:00:13,329 --> 00:00:15,769
I don't think it is,
because it's like day five.

9
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,586
And I haven't done this
once, I can't imagine it

10
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:20,526
yeah, I don't know if
it's really it or not,

11
00:00:20,526 --> 00:00:22,456
but I can't sleep at all.

12
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,095
Calvin just woke up and I'm proud of him,

13
00:00:25,095 --> 00:00:28,277
because he just said he needed to go poop.

14
00:00:28,277 --> 00:00:29,625
Are you going?

15
00:00:29,625 --> 00:00:30,458
- [Calvin] Yeah.

16
00:00:30,458 --> 00:00:31,708
- Are you done?

17
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,908
My screen looks funny, big white teeth.

18
00:00:36,908 --> 00:00:38,420
I'm so proud of him.

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,279
So instead of being
mad, I'm gonna be happy.

20
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:44,279
And we're all gonna take naps later.

21
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:48,883
(Ellie laughs)

22
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:50,716
You are doing so good.

23
00:00:51,807 --> 00:00:52,640
- Huh.

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,229
- [Ellie] I'm proud of you.

25
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:56,364
- Puff chit chit puff.

26
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:58,622
- [Ellie] It just happens.

27
00:00:58,622 --> 00:00:59,455
- Yeah.

28
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:05,768
- Good morning, I am here
with a special buddy of mine

29
00:01:05,768 --> 00:01:07,304
and we are working on a few things today

30
00:01:07,304 --> 00:01:09,442
and I want to show you
what we've been practicing.

31
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:10,831
Hi Penny, how are you?

32
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:12,822
We've been working on loose leash walking.

33
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,856
Just so it's so much easier
for her to walk around

34
00:01:15,856 --> 00:01:17,536
and we've had some good success

35
00:01:17,536 --> 00:01:19,632
and some not so good success.

36
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:21,370
So I'm hoping that what I show you,

37
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:23,128
is the positive side of it.
(bright music)

38
00:01:23,128 --> 00:01:25,120
Okay, are you ready to rock and roll?

39
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,168
Should we start?

40
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:28,390
Let's start really slowly, okay?

41
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,223
Okay.

42
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:31,798
Good girl.

43
00:01:31,798 --> 00:01:33,621
See how loose that is, that's so great.

44
00:01:33,621 --> 00:01:35,626
I don't have anything in my hand.

45
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:36,626
You just stay right there,

46
00:01:36,626 --> 00:01:38,626
we're not pulling, good.

47
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,017
That's a good girl Penny.

48
00:01:42,017 --> 00:01:43,786
You only get as much as I have, op,

49
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:46,052
okay, so now you pulled a little bit,

50
00:01:46,052 --> 00:01:47,882
we're gonna come this way.

51
00:01:47,882 --> 00:01:52,541
And we'll come back here,
and we'll sit, good girl.

52
00:01:52,541 --> 00:01:54,697
Okay, let's try again.

53
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,530
Good girl.

54
00:01:56,487 --> 00:01:57,456
So what we're practicing now

55
00:01:57,456 --> 00:01:59,496
might be the hardest thing
that Penny has to deal with.

56
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:00,329
(barking)

57
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,115
We are walking past a neighbor's house

58
00:02:02,115 --> 00:02:04,259
who has a dog, you can
hear the dog barking.

59
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,339
And the whole point of this exercise

60
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:09,378
is that Penny does not
proceed with her walk

61
00:02:09,378 --> 00:02:10,594
while she's pulling.

62
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:12,715
If she pulls, we go back to the beginning

63
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,147
and we progressively go,

64
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:17,178
until she's loose leash
walking all the way past

65
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,865
the dog who's barking.

66
00:02:18,865 --> 00:02:19,977
So this is tough for Penny

67
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:22,529
because she loves dogs, oh, see?

68
00:02:22,529 --> 00:02:24,781
So we go back a little bit further,

69
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:26,830
we go back further and we start

70
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:29,620
from the beginning, loose leash,

71
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,692
and then the further she can loose leash,

72
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,141
the better, the more we go,

73
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:36,077
the more she's rewarded with
walking with a loose leash.

74
00:02:36,077 --> 00:02:38,285
So here we go, you ready?

75
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:39,118
Let's go.

76
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,949
Oh okay there we go, let's
start at the beginning.

77
00:02:42,949 --> 00:02:43,782
Good girl.

78
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,845
Oh okay, let's start over.

79
00:02:47,845 --> 00:02:48,678
Okay.

80
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:52,014
Oh, okay.

81
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,123
Let's try again.

82
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,885
Easy.

83
00:02:59,885 --> 00:03:00,802
Nope, okay.

84
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:03,718
Nope.

85
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:05,405
So you can see this is
very difficult for her,

86
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,005
which is why we're working on it.

87
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:08,662
So a day at a time at this,

88
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:09,704
she'll be good in no time.

89
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:10,792
Alright Penny, let's go home.

90
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:11,841
Come on (clicks tongue).

91
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:16,203
Yes, good girl, that's a
good girl, look at that.

92
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,163
Standing right next to me,

93
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,403
checking in every once in a while.

94
00:03:18,403 --> 00:03:19,653
Yes, good girl.

95
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,925
That's a good girl.

96
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:24,675
(music on radio)

97
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:29,040
(laughing)

98
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,949
You were doing good Jackson, keep singing.

99
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,551
He was singing to this song.

100
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:34,884
He was doing the

101
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,318
♪ I had a dream da da ♪

102
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,648
He was singing that.

103
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,130
Like our little boy singing,

104
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,798
that's so cute, he knows the words

105
00:03:43,798 --> 00:03:45,159
to the song on the radio,

106
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,512
but as soon as the camera came on,

107
00:03:46,512 --> 00:03:48,274
he's like no no no.

108
00:03:48,274 --> 00:03:49,983
What a cutie.

109
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:51,009
We're going over to my parents house

110
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:53,201
right now to visit them.

111
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,754
You might want to keep
driving, so we hear him.

112
00:03:56,754 --> 00:03:59,247
(laughing)

113
00:03:59,247 --> 00:04:00,414
You caught me.

114
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,923
- What happened to Grandpa's eye.

115
00:04:05,923 --> 00:04:10,618
- [Grandpa] I had a thing that
he had to cut out of my face.

116
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:12,050
- What was it?

117
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,221
- [Grandpa] It's called cancer.

118
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,341
- Oh.

119
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:18,208
What does cancer mean?

120
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,107
- Cancer means that something is growing

121
00:04:20,107 --> 00:04:22,308
on your face that shouldn't grow there.

122
00:04:22,308 --> 00:04:23,707
- Oh.

123
00:04:23,707 --> 00:04:25,683
- So the doctor got it off.

124
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:26,516
- [Grandpa] Hi.

125
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,578
- [Jackson] And then he cut it open.

126
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:30,423
(Calvin vocalizing)

127
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:33,673
- Yeah, I have an owie on my face, huh?

128
00:04:34,514 --> 00:04:36,011
- Ooh.
- Oh.

129
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:36,972
- Did you see his face?

130
00:04:36,972 --> 00:04:37,805
- Yeah.

131
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:39,911
He's like.

132
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:40,744
- Are you okay?

133
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:43,686
- [Grandpa] Yep, I'm doing great.

134
00:04:43,686 --> 00:04:45,389
- That's good, well I'm glad to hear it.

135
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:47,615
So my dad had skin cancer,

136
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,374
and I don't know if we showed before,

137
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:52,134
but he was wearing a little bandaid here

138
00:04:52,134 --> 00:04:55,598
for awhile, and that's
where the skin cancer was

139
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,674
and he went in for surgery today

140
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,389
and they removed it,

141
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,221
and I guess, the longest
part of the procedure

142
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:04,317
was seeing if they removed everything.

143
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:06,900
But apparently the news is that

144
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:08,646
- They got it all.

145
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:11,361
- [Jared] Oh good, so you
are cancer free right now.

146
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:12,194
- That is correct.

147
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:14,963
- When you were talking, I can't remember

148
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,920
you just said it, did he mention anything

149
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,536
about it growing back?

150
00:05:18,536 --> 00:05:20,431
- No he didn't, no he didn't say that.

151
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,462
- [Jared] So there's a chance
that it could grow back.

152
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,949
- You know, I'm of the skin type

153
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,116
that is very susceptible to skin cancer.

154
00:05:28,116 --> 00:05:30,014
- [Jared] Which is like the fair skin,

155
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:31,505
blonde hair, blue eyes.

156
00:05:31,505 --> 00:05:32,338
- Right, right.

157
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:33,203
- Dad had his procedure today,

158
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,385
but everything looks like
it's going really well.

159
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:38,345
It's crazy that, you know,

160
00:05:38,345 --> 00:05:40,900
this has never been
something I've thought about,

161
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,067
like cancer in our family.

162
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,048
Like on my side, we don't have
a lot of people with cancer,

163
00:05:47,048 --> 00:05:50,187
so when we heard Dad did have cancer,

164
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:53,224
like that's nerve wracking a little bit.

165
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:54,954
- Yeah it was a little scary.

166
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:55,787
- [Jared] Yeah.

167
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,620
- I was a little worried.

168
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,791
- It's something that
we have to worry about,

169
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,700
because your dad had some skin cancer,

170
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,756
Bonnie had pre skin cancer.

171
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:03,793
So it almost makes me like, okay we got

172
00:06:03,793 --> 00:06:06,083
to make a dermatology
appointment, just to make sure.

173
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,348
Well I'm glad you're feeling better

174
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,154
or at least, you're gonna feel better.

175
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:10,987
- Yeah yeah.

176
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:12,338
- [Jared] I don't think
you feel all that great.

177
00:06:12,338 --> 00:06:14,853
- Plus I'll have a huge scar

178
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:16,222
and I'll make up some really good stories

179
00:06:16,222 --> 00:06:17,117
to tell about it.

180
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:19,263
- [Jared] Oh and then
I can call you two face

181
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,770
or even just Scar like The Lion King.

182
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,839
- Scarface.

183
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:22,957
- Scarface, yeah.

184
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:24,440
I think one thing that
surprised me the most

185
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,037
was that Dad did have that
tiny little bandaid on,

186
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,825
and the skin cancer didn't appear

187
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:33,148
bigger than that tiny little bandaid,

188
00:06:33,148 --> 00:06:33,981
- Correct.

189
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:35,715
- But the scar that is there,

190
00:06:35,715 --> 00:06:37,384
is the size of that bandage.

191
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:41,689
I have a picture,
warning, it's a big scar.

192
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:43,227
So, careful, but I'll show it.

193
00:06:43,227 --> 00:06:45,419
All the way down Dad's face,

194
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:46,252
and it's pretty intense,

195
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,431
but they had to do that
to get all the cancer.

196
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:49,264
- Right.

197
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:50,097
- I mean that's crazy.

198
00:06:50,097 --> 00:06:52,315
- And not only to get the Cancer,

199
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:55,448
but then to make something
that they could sow up

200
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,926
and reduce the scarring.

201
00:06:57,926 --> 00:07:00,711
- It's just because of your
skin type, just because of the--

202
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,082
- Well yeah, I'm more susceptible.

203
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:03,915
- Yeah.

204
00:07:03,915 --> 00:07:06,525
- If I would've worn
sunscreen my whole life.

205
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:07,739
- Okay, so sun scream would've helped

206
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:08,572
- Yeah.

207
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:09,405
- [Jared] in this situation.

208
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:12,482
- Yeah, it would've, but you know,

209
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:15,034
when you're growing up, back at the time

210
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,848
that I grew up, sunscreen
wasn't even a thing.

211
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:18,681
- [Jared] Yeah.

212
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,013
- Shade wasn't even a thing.

213
00:07:20,013 --> 00:07:21,624
(laughing)

214
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,511
- You had to work in 90 degree heat

215
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:25,723
with sun blazing even
during the wintertime,

216
00:07:25,723 --> 00:07:26,840
that's what it was like.

217
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,929
And then in the wintertime

218
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,255
you walked uphill both ways in the snow

219
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:30,088
- [Grandpa] That's right.

220
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:30,921
- to school.

221
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:31,754
- [Grandpa] That's right.

222
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,397
- I hope you feel better.

223
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:35,205
- Aw, thank you.

224
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,455
(laughing)

225
00:07:41,731 --> 00:07:42,564
(thud)

226
00:07:42,564 --> 00:07:43,909
- (gasps) oh.
- Oh.

227
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:44,742
- You okay?
- Is your foot okay?

228
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:45,988
- Yeah.

229
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:49,443
- Okay, so this is their
favorite thing to do,

230
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:50,602
is to jump.

231
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:54,250
Okay, so I got my Christmas onesie on

232
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,583
and Jackson saw it and goes,

233
00:07:58,018 --> 00:08:00,946
you have a Christmas jammie?

234
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:03,747
And he was so excited I said,

235
00:08:03,747 --> 00:08:05,530
maybe next week we can go as a family

236
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,890
to the store and we can all pick out

237
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,882
Christmas jammies together.

238
00:08:08,882 --> 00:08:12,771
And Grandma I noticed,
Grandma bought this for you.

239
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:14,103
That is so and warm.

240
00:08:14,103 --> 00:08:15,281
Did you tell her thank you?

241
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,114
- Fox!

242
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:17,345
Thank you Grandma.

243
00:08:17,345 --> 00:08:18,725
- [Ellie] That was so nice of her.

244
00:08:18,725 --> 00:08:19,732
You look so cozy and warm.

245
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:20,896
Okay go jump.

246
00:08:20,896 --> 00:08:24,479
So Jared and I, we just
got our fall winter

247
00:08:25,456 --> 00:08:27,576
merch that's up on Teespring right now.

248
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:29,230
We have some really fun designs,

249
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,073
some really funny Christmas sweaters,

250
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:34,489
ugly Christmas sweaters
I guess you could say.

251
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,265
They're really cute, I hope you like them,

252
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,553
but for those of you that are interested,

253
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:39,484
we'll have that in the description.

254
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,273
But right now, we have
a little family activity

255
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,840
we want to do that I've been
wanting to do for a minute,

256
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,673
but we're gonna do it now.

257
00:08:46,673 --> 00:08:48,354
We have the paper,

258
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:50,605
and we have, upstairs in
the pantry is those markers.

259
00:08:50,605 --> 00:08:52,286
- [Jared] I was gonna say, we
need something to write with.

260
00:08:52,286 --> 00:08:53,289
- Yeah, I'll go grab 'em.

261
00:08:53,289 --> 00:08:56,127
Every year, Halloween, the holidays,

262
00:08:56,127 --> 00:08:57,826
Thanksgiving, then Christmas,

263
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,018
it comes and then it goes so fast

264
00:09:00,018 --> 00:09:03,274
and I have learned that if
I do not write things down

265
00:09:03,274 --> 00:09:06,003
and I actually prepare my month out,

266
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:09,461
I don't do everything
that I really want to do.

267
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:11,065
And so tonight, I told Jared,

268
00:09:11,065 --> 00:09:12,536
I thought it would be fun to make a list

269
00:09:12,536 --> 00:09:14,945
of a bunch of things we want to do.

270
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:17,272
Go see a few movies, go ice skating,

271
00:09:17,272 --> 00:09:20,022
go do a few crafts with the kids.

272
00:09:20,897 --> 00:09:22,640
There's a lot of things that I want to do,

273
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,961
and I feel like if I don't write it down

274
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,159
and have a check list, I won't do it all.

275
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,597
And even at Halloween, I wanted to watch

276
00:09:30,597 --> 00:09:33,085
so many more movies with the kids,

277
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,518
like certain movies,

278
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:36,311
and I didn't end up watching them.

279
00:09:36,311 --> 00:09:37,846
And it sounds so silly,

280
00:09:37,846 --> 00:09:40,404
but I feel like if I see it,

281
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:41,356
I'll do it, you know?

282
00:09:41,356 --> 00:09:42,189
- Yeah.

283
00:09:42,189 --> 00:09:43,022
You gotta have a plan.
- I don't know.

284
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:44,196
- You gotta execute.

285
00:09:44,196 --> 00:09:45,034
- Yeah,
- Execution Ellie.

286
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,134
- Even if you don't do all of them,

287
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:48,741
at least we'll have some
fun things written down

288
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:50,637
that we know we want to do.

289
00:09:50,637 --> 00:09:52,918
Like even making cookies,

290
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,675
it comes and goes so fast,

291
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:57,923
like it's already the end,
we're almost at Thanksgiving

292
00:09:57,923 --> 00:10:01,545
and I kinda want to start a new tradition.

293
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:04,499
We don't have a whole
ton of traditions yet.

294
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,188
Our kids are just getting to that age

295
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:09,370
where they're remembering stuff,

296
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,145
it's just more fun to take them out,

297
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,329
because they're enjoying
the experiences more.

298
00:10:16,329 --> 00:10:19,442
And I think that it would
be really fun to set up

299
00:10:19,442 --> 00:10:22,521
the Christmas tree before Thanksgiving,

300
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,666
because I feel like it will bring in

301
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,343
that holiday spirit even more.

302
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:29,105
And I know there's like a huge thing

303
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:33,050
like don't skip Thanksgiving
and jump into Christmas,

304
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,557
but I think that it just brings
in that spirit, you know?

305
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:39,605
- Yeah, throughout the whole time.

306
00:10:39,605 --> 00:10:41,128
You could have the
holiday spirit throughout

307
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,145
all of the holidays.

308
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:44,324
- Yeah, I just think it would
be pretty to have a tree.

309
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:45,634
I remember one year my mom,

310
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,059
she didn't have a Christmas tree up,

311
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:51,579
but she had a few pine
trees that had lights,

312
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:54,301
and I just remember it
feeling really special.

313
00:10:54,301 --> 00:10:55,615
So I think maybe here in a few days,

314
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,480
we'll do the tree.

315
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,576
We won't decorate it,

316
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,283
we'll just have it up for the lights.

317
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,157
And then we'll decorate
it after Thanksgiving.

318
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:03,692
- I totally thought you
said the trees had lice.

319
00:11:03,692 --> 00:11:04,525
And I was like those are not trees

320
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:06,366
that you want to have in your house.

321
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:07,343
No lice please.
(Ellie laughs)

322
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:09,342
- [Ellie] Did you just draw an S?

323
00:11:09,342 --> 00:11:10,175
- [Jackson] Mmm-mmm.

324
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:12,927
- Are you gonna trace the
letters like you do at school?

325
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:14,575
Jackson overheard what we were saying.

326
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:15,975
And when I went upstairs
to get the markers,

327
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:19,988
he goes, am I gonna do a
list, a list for Santa?

328
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:22,945
And I said well yeah if
that's what you want to do.

329
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:24,002
- [Jared] That's so fun.

330
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:27,129
- [Ellie] So he's gonna
make a little list.

331
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:28,287
And we've talked a lot already

332
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,204
about Thanksgiving and giving, huh?

333
00:11:32,667 --> 00:11:34,704
Do you remember those talks?

334
00:11:34,704 --> 00:11:37,385
And we have some fun things
that we are going to be doing,

335
00:11:37,385 --> 00:11:41,552
but think it's really cute
that he wanted to do this.

336
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:44,665
- That's not a list.

337
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,361
Calvin, that's not a list.

338
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,028
You have to do a list for Santa.

339
00:11:49,937 --> 00:11:51,114
- Jackson,
- Mommy Mommy look.

340
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:53,974
- what do you want from Santa?

341
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,590
- A remote control race track

342
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:00,534
with loop-de-loops of
boats and remote cars.

343
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:02,259
- He's thought about this.

344
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,092
So are you gonna write it down

345
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,278
and we'll mail this to Santa Claus?

346
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:06,111
- Mmm-mmm.

347
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:07,707
- Okay, Calvin you make sure to write down

348
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:08,540
what do you want

349
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,936
What do you want for Christmas?

350
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,769
- Eat.

351
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,342
- You want to eat?

352
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:13,478
- Yeah.

353
00:12:13,478 --> 00:12:14,430
- I did this one.

354
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,997
- You did an A, good job.
- That looks so good.

355
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:18,617
- [Calvin] A, he A.

356
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:20,066
- [Jared] Yeah it is an A.

357
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,979
We got three percent on here so.

358
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,146
That's a wrap.
