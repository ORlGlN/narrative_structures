1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,232
- We are here at the world's

2
00:00:01,232 --> 00:00:02,899
largest baby shower!

3
00:00:03,927 --> 00:00:05,492
Are you ready to have three kids?!

4
00:00:05,492 --> 00:00:06,742
It's beautiful!

5
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:08,718
Alright our bed is made

6
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:10,758
for Bonnie and Joel.

7
00:00:10,758 --> 00:00:11,755
(Laughter)

8
00:00:11,755 --> 00:00:13,804
Our bag is crazy jam-packed.

9
00:00:13,804 --> 00:00:15,380
And we are ready!

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,607
The kids are still asleep,

11
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:18,137
it's pretty early in the morning.

12
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:19,570
- That's a miracle. (Ellie laughs)

13
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:21,301
- They've been doing so awesome.

14
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,544
- [Jared] Yes they have.

15
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,861
- And we are getting
ready to catch a flight.

16
00:00:24,861 --> 00:00:26,593
We are gonna be gone for...

17
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,618
One day!
- Less than 24 hours.

18
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:29,493
- We're going to...

19
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:32,238
- San Francisco!!

20
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,072
(light pop music)

21
00:00:40,176 --> 00:00:41,491
What is your favorite thing

22
00:00:41,491 --> 00:00:43,241
to do on long drives?

23
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:44,945
Like, what do you do

24
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,362
to pass the time?

25
00:00:47,373 --> 00:00:48,674
- I like when we sing.

26
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,631
- Uh huh.

27
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:51,235
I was just going to say,

28
00:00:51,235 --> 00:00:52,974
I know for a fact that when you're

29
00:00:52,974 --> 00:00:54,258
in the car by yourself,

30
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:55,956
you crank up the music

31
00:00:55,956 --> 00:00:57,891
- Oh yeah, I rock out
- and you sing your heart out

32
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,591
- The sunroof's open and I rock out,

33
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:00,722
Why? Do you see me?

34
00:01:00,722 --> 00:01:02,390
- No I get in the car afterwards

35
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,656
and the music is like
turned up to a hundred.

36
00:01:06,656 --> 00:01:07,581
- Yeah, 'cause if it's just me

37
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:09,214
and I don't have to
worry about kid's ears,

38
00:01:09,214 --> 00:01:10,387
I just turn it up.

39
00:01:10,387 --> 00:01:12,180
- And it's like 'Sorry, not sorry!'

40
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,650
- No that is exactly what I do.

41
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,735
'Yeah, yeah!' (Laughs)

42
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:17,000
- I like to listen to music.

43
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,479
I like to listen to motivational books

44
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:20,666
and sometimes I just like

45
00:01:20,666 --> 00:01:22,193
to sit in silence.

46
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:23,026
- Yeah.

47
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:24,499
And I like to look around

48
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:27,043
not while I'm driving--

49
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:29,708
- Welcome to San Francisco!

50
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:31,799
- And we do not have
even one minute to waste.

51
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,731
- Not one minute.

52
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,963
So we are here for

53
00:01:33,963 --> 00:01:35,657
the world's largest baby shower.

54
00:01:35,657 --> 00:01:36,565
For you!

55
00:01:36,565 --> 00:01:37,749
For you, Ellie!

56
00:01:37,749 --> 00:01:39,324
And we're gonna learn so much there.

57
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,994
But that's not until later tonight!

58
00:01:40,994 --> 00:01:41,867
So we've got a couple hours

59
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:44,084
to get a lot of things
done in San Francisco.

60
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:44,946
We've got sights to see,

61
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,534
places to be, bikes to ride.

62
00:01:46,534 --> 00:01:47,517
- We have enough time

63
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:48,794
to go to the Golden Gate Bridge,

64
00:01:48,794 --> 00:01:50,456
ride our bike, see the water,

65
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,600
ride it back,

66
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,457
maybe grab dinner, hopefully.

67
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:55,352
We should, or I'll be hangry.

68
00:01:55,352 --> 00:01:57,225
And then go to this

69
00:01:57,225 --> 00:01:58,787
awesome convention.
- The event.

70
00:01:58,787 --> 00:01:59,833
- I'm so excited!

71
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,566
- We are trying to limit

72
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,938
the hangriness on this trip

73
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:04,548
as much as humanly possible.

74
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:05,799
- I grabbed us a few M&Ms

75
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:06,835
to hold us by.

76
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,232
- Okay, let's go and explore the city!

77
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:10,250
I love you.

78
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,124
- And it's warm!

79
00:02:11,124 --> 00:02:12,358
- It's so warm here.

80
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:15,191
(light pop music)

81
00:02:20,017 --> 00:02:20,938
- [Jared] Are you ready for this?

82
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:21,997
- Yes!

83
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:23,676
I'm all fashioned up!

84
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,509
- [Jared] Yeah!

85
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,838
- Ready for my bike ride.

86
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:26,757
Ready to go, boyfriend?

87
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,194
- Let's go, girlfriend!

88
00:02:28,194 --> 00:02:29,795
- [Ellie] Look at the houses!

89
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:31,087
Jared!

90
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:31,920
- Look at that!

91
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,440
- [Ellie] Look at all
those doggies out there!

92
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,068
Look at that!

93
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:36,901
Holy crap,

94
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:38,316
our legs are on fire

95
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,032
but isn't that beautiful?

96
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:42,865
(light pop music)

97
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:15,283
- We made it to the Golden Gate Bridge!

98
00:03:15,283 --> 00:03:17,151
- It's beautiful!

99
00:03:17,151 --> 00:03:18,237
- And now we gotta go home!

100
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:19,923
Back to the hotel.

101
00:03:19,923 --> 00:03:20,756
Apparently this is how

102
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:21,736
you beat the traffic.

103
00:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,223
You just get a tiny car!

104
00:03:23,223 --> 00:03:25,040
Is everything tiny in San Franciso?

105
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,639
- We're ready!
- Hi pregnant mommy!

106
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,121
- Are you ready to have three kids?

107
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:30,087
- Oh my goodness,

108
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,381
I don't even believe it.

109
00:03:31,381 --> 00:03:33,282
- It still doesn't feel real.
- I don't believe it.

110
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,302
- He's been moving all day.

111
00:03:34,302 --> 00:03:35,665
- I know, you've been saying like

112
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:37,040
(gasps) Oh!

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,873
Ooh! Ooh!

114
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:39,546
- You're gonna film it
soon! (Jared laughs)

115
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:40,379
Even more!

116
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,329
- So today has worked out

117
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,832
perfectly to a tee.

118
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:45,860
We got off the airplane,

119
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,533
raced to our hotel,

120
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,557
raced to the Golden Gate Bridge area

121
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:51,247
like the Lombard Street,

122
00:03:51,247 --> 00:03:52,435
or wherever.

123
00:03:52,435 --> 00:03:53,956
Rented bikes, biked there

124
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:55,182
and then we came back

125
00:03:55,182 --> 00:03:56,191
and everyone was saying that

126
00:03:56,191 --> 00:03:57,557
traffic was gonna take us

127
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:58,726
an hour and a half

128
00:03:58,726 --> 00:03:59,559
so we were booking it.

129
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:01,860
But we got everything
done that we wanted to

130
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,786
before this event that we're going to

131
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,940
and we had enough time to even

132
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,424
freshen up a little bit

133
00:04:06,424 --> 00:04:09,507
and these are the outfits of the day.

134
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,699
What do you think?

135
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:13,851
- [Ellie] I'm peeing!

136
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:14,684
- I'm glad.

137
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:15,517
Enjoy yourself.

138
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:16,350
- We are here at

139
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,123
the world's largest baby shower!

140
00:04:18,123 --> 00:04:19,451
They have so many products,

141
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,452
a little bit of tech

142
00:04:20,452 --> 00:04:22,178
that I cannot wait to go and see.

143
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,359
- One of the things that I missed

144
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:24,423
at CES was all of the

145
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:26,903
home and baby tech stuff.

146
00:04:26,903 --> 00:04:27,736
- I was so sad!

147
00:04:27,736 --> 00:04:28,767
- I know, I was sad too,

148
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:29,878
so I'm glad we're here

149
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:30,900
so we can see some of this

150
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,701
really, really cool stuff.

151
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:34,374
- You are not walking fast enough!

152
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:36,705
- Ellie is so excited
to see everything here.

153
00:04:36,705 --> 00:04:38,045
I cannot keep up.

154
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,074
- It's the bassinet.

155
00:04:39,074 --> 00:04:40,113
- The bassinets.

156
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:40,946
Oh but it's the strollers,
- That's the one thing

157
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:42,115
I really want.

158
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,595
- but it's the car seats.
- Well strollers are cool

159
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,151
but I want to look at the bassinets.

160
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:48,234
(light techno music)

161
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:55,717
I have a Tula at home

162
00:04:55,717 --> 00:04:56,996
which I love the wrap.

163
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,471
I have a Tula and a Ergo

164
00:04:58,471 --> 00:05:00,091
and I like the Tulas a lot.

165
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,001
I have never had uh,

166
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,248
a high chair.

167
00:05:03,248 --> 00:05:04,925
Do you wanna go look at the high chairs?

168
00:05:04,925 --> 00:05:05,758
- [Jared] Yeah!

169
00:05:05,758 --> 00:05:07,026
What's crazy to me is that

170
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:08,129
so we've been parents for what,

171
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,054
four years now?

172
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:10,735
And even in four years,

173
00:05:10,735 --> 00:05:12,405
the baby tech game

174
00:05:12,405 --> 00:05:13,309
like, the baby game

175
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:14,711
has changed so much.

176
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:15,863
This is a car seat

177
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:17,791
that folds into a stroller.

178
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:18,624
Oh wait!

179
00:05:18,624 --> 00:05:19,496
Is it a stroller

180
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,589
that folds into a car seat?

181
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,688
Look at that!

182
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:23,875
Isn't that so cool?

183
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,336
I think this is new from them.

184
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,023
- But these are cool!
- This looks cool.

185
00:05:27,023 --> 00:05:27,856
- I like that,

186
00:05:27,856 --> 00:05:28,689
I like the white one.

187
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:29,901
How cute would that be?

188
00:05:29,901 --> 00:05:31,063
- [Sales Rep] The target ends on the--

189
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:31,969
- [Jared] Whaaat??!

190
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:33,299
How does that work?

191
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,801
- It's magnetic.

192
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,313
- [Jared] Ellie, that's magic!

193
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:38,146
- [Sales Rep] We can put it

194
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:38,979
a little more in the middle

195
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:40,230
so it's a little bit more magnetic.

196
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,571
Super easy to put back.

197
00:05:41,571 --> 00:05:44,376
- [Ellie] Babe's got it!

198
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,640
(Ellie Laughs)

199
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,057
- That's amazing.

200
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,444
I found you. (Laughs)

201
00:05:50,444 --> 00:05:51,374
Oh wow,

202
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:52,736
so you can grab the baby

203
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:54,318
is that what that is?
- Yeah, it's just right

204
00:05:54,318 --> 00:05:55,754
It's easier by your bed.
- Yeah.

205
00:05:55,754 --> 00:05:58,837
(light techno music)

206
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,608
Just in case you forgot,

207
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:07,740
(Ellie laughs)

208
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,657
It's a Boy!

209
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,493
That's so sweet.

210
00:06:10,493 --> 00:06:11,326
We were getting ready

211
00:06:11,326 --> 00:06:13,650
to meet with a pediatrician,

212
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,150
awesome scientist,

213
00:06:16,145 --> 00:06:18,394
CMO of so many things.

214
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:20,859
- I am so excited to talk to her.

215
00:06:20,859 --> 00:06:23,157
We've been talking to
her for like an hour.

216
00:06:23,157 --> 00:06:25,704
And she's like willing to
come do videos with us,

217
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:26,711
like for education.

218
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:27,580
There she is right now!

219
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,742
- There she comes now!

220
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:29,975
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

221
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:31,519
Doctor Swanson!
- This is so exciting!

222
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:34,085
How cute she's been to us.

223
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:35,122
I love this!

224
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:35,995
- So we're here at

225
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,178
this big event with Spoonful One

226
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:40,115
and Spoonful One is a company that creates

227
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:43,023
a mix-in for food

228
00:06:43,023 --> 00:06:44,894
that helps introduce your babies

229
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,784
to potential allergens and
helps with all of that.

230
00:06:47,784 --> 00:06:48,617
And we're meeting with

231
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:49,729
Dr. Swanson to talk about

232
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:50,804
food allergies and everything.

233
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:51,757
So I wanted to ask a

234
00:06:51,757 --> 00:06:52,779
first question to you:

235
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:53,612
- Sure.

236
00:06:53,612 --> 00:06:55,320
- What exactly is a food allergy?

237
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,353
- Well, a food allergy is

238
00:06:56,353 --> 00:06:57,919
a complex interaction

239
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,548
that your body's having where

240
00:06:59,548 --> 00:07:01,942
it's really not reacting
in the way that we expect.

241
00:07:01,942 --> 00:07:03,657
So when you don't have a food allergy

242
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,616
you put food in your body,

243
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:05,554
your body breaks it down,

244
00:07:05,554 --> 00:07:06,474
takes the energy from it

245
00:07:06,474 --> 00:07:07,550
and it goes fine.

246
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,099
When you've got a food allergy,

247
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:10,967
your immune system does something

248
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,215
where it overreacts

249
00:07:12,215 --> 00:07:14,116
or it's kind of agitated in a way.

250
00:07:14,116 --> 00:07:16,200
And it sets off on a cascade of reactions

251
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,783
where you can have skin rash,

252
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:19,404
you can sometimes have tummy ache,

253
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,407
you can have vomiting,

254
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,436
you can have hives,

255
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,313
and of course sometime with food allergies

256
00:07:23,313 --> 00:07:25,054
you can have a life-threatening condition

257
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,506
called anaphylaxis.

258
00:07:26,506 --> 00:07:27,984
- We don't have a history of it,

259
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,066
my kids don't have it,

260
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,642
can they develop it?

261
00:07:30,642 --> 00:07:32,173
- Anyone can develop a food allergy.

262
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:33,669
- Later on?
- That's the scary part.

263
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:34,502
Yeah, I mean you and I

264
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:35,496
could still develop a food allergy.

265
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,830
Now, if we eat a really diverse diet

266
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,070
and we keep exposing ourselves,

267
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,068
it's unlikely that our immune
system will kinda go haywire.

268
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:44,061
But hereditary, in the
genome itself is not,

269
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:45,255
I can't point to it and say

270
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,206
'That's the problem,'

271
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,406
'that's what causes food allergies.'

272
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:48,320
In fact, you know,

273
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,686
65% of kids who have a food allergy

274
00:07:50,686 --> 00:07:53,077
don't have family member who does.

275
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:55,568
- Can you protect my
baby from food allergies?

276
00:07:55,568 --> 00:07:56,570
- Well new science is changing

277
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,700
how we understand that.

278
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,463
We know that breastfeeding is best

279
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:00,929
and formula feeding is great too,

280
00:08:00,929 --> 00:08:02,317
but it isn't protective.

281
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:03,420
Breastfeeding isn't protective

282
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,564
against food allergies.

283
00:08:04,564 --> 00:08:05,752
The best thing that we know

284
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,465
that you can do now is getting high

285
00:08:07,465 --> 00:08:10,800
or potential allergenic
foods in early and often.

286
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,909
If you feed em right away,

287
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,220
you don't wait a long time,

288
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,871
you can try a new food every day.

289
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,218
And then it's not one and done.

290
00:08:16,218 --> 00:08:17,061
I mean it's really,

291
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,418
you introduce peanut
- You keep--

292
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,289
- You keep doing it.

293
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:20,443
You want to give babies

294
00:08:20,443 --> 00:08:22,844
all sorts of diverse
foods every single day

295
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:24,085
so their immune system is just

296
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:25,176
growing up with peanut,

297
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:26,343
growing up with avocado,

298
00:08:26,343 --> 00:08:27,661
growing up with wheat,

299
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:29,144
growing up with soy,

300
00:08:29,144 --> 00:08:30,059
- I love it.
- Growing up with anything

301
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,669
that they get used to.

302
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:33,091
So they don't trigger

303
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:34,433
an immune dysfunction

304
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:35,409
that would cause them

305
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:36,629
to overreact to that later.

306
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,876
The AAAAI which is

307
00:08:38,876 --> 00:08:42,216
this big asthma, allergy,
and immunology academy says

308
00:08:42,217 --> 00:08:43,813
right when you start feeding solid foods

309
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,078
at four to six months of age,

310
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:47,069
we want you to start with--
- Introducing--

311
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:48,739
- All the potential allergens right away.

312
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:50,050
- Hey!
- And I'm saying

313
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,109
I don't want you to take your time

314
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:52,744
and take six months to get through them.

315
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,116
I'm saying, get it done!
- Start it.

316
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:55,604
- You can start a food on Monday,

317
00:08:55,604 --> 00:08:56,670
the next day,
- That's interesting.

318
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,784
- You can start another one.

319
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:01,223
And in some ways that's
where Spoonful One comes in.

320
00:09:01,223 --> 00:09:02,056
What we do know

321
00:09:02,056 --> 00:09:02,889
is there was a second study

322
00:09:02,889 --> 00:09:03,949
called the Eats study.

323
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:04,901
And what the Eats study did

324
00:09:04,901 --> 00:09:06,169
is took breastfed babies

325
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,417
and it gave them five of these

326
00:09:07,417 --> 00:09:09,917
higher allergy foods
or potential allergen.

327
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:11,892
Gave them to them on a regular basis.

328
00:09:11,892 --> 00:09:13,512
And it was hard for families

329
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,373
to get all five of those

330
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:15,938
foods in every day, right?
- Yeah.

331
00:09:15,938 --> 00:09:16,940
- In the families that were able

332
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,790
to give their babies those foods regularly

333
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,019
they were much less likely
to have a food allergy.

334
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,063
- What are the common
foods that cause problems?

335
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,327
We hear so much about peanuts,

336
00:09:24,327 --> 00:09:26,230
anything else we should think about?

337
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,737
- Well we do think about peanut

338
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:29,256
because it's the most common in kids.

339
00:09:29,256 --> 00:09:30,648
But 75% of people who

340
00:09:30,648 --> 00:09:31,801
have a food allergy

341
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,034
have an allergy that is something

342
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,197
other than peanut.

343
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:35,559
'Cause they have peanut and

344
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:36,641
or they have something else.

345
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:38,049
So we think about tree nuts,

346
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,880
so pistachios and walnuts

347
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,208
and things like that.

348
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,992
We of course think about fish

349
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:45,134
so regular fish that swim in the ocean

350
00:09:45,134 --> 00:09:47,040
and shellfish and then we think about

351
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,333
things that are really
common in the American diet.

352
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,580
So things like milk,

353
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,131
so that dairy product.

354
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:54,754
Or we think about soy, wheat, and egg.

355
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:55,948
- Awesome.

356
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:58,045
A huge thanks to Dr. Swanson!

357
00:09:58,045 --> 00:09:59,543
And my new friend for helping me

358
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:01,197
answer some questions

359
00:10:01,197 --> 00:10:03,000
and hopefully giving you
guys some information.

360
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,076
I know that I learned a lot today

361
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,327
and not even just learned a lot

362
00:10:06,327 --> 00:10:08,624
but just felt reassured
about what I'm doing

363
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:10,393
with my own kids at my own home.

364
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,117
We're gonna have a link to Spoonful One

365
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:13,349
in our description.

366
00:10:13,349 --> 00:10:15,303
- This is for anyone who wants to really

367
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:16,350
kind of, decrease that risk of

368
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,658
developing food allergies later on.

369
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,082
- Perfect.
- That's spoonfulone.com

370
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:20,562
- Thank you so much!

371
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:22,894
I have loved everything about this night.

372
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:24,821
I have loved looking at baby product

373
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:25,695
after baby product,

374
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:26,890
after baby product!

375
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,322
- It was so much fun and--

376
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:29,468
- I've been giddy,

377
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:30,428
I loved--

378
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:31,412
I'm sorry I interrupted you.

379
00:10:31,412 --> 00:10:32,245
- It's okay.

380
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,322
- I loved the presentations

381
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:34,714
by the pediatricians

382
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:35,830
and the doctors.

383
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,663
I loved hearing what

384
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:37,670
they had to say.

385
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,902
- It just adds another

386
00:10:38,902 --> 00:10:40,186
excitement level for us

387
00:10:40,186 --> 00:10:42,044
being pregnant and having another baby.

388
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:42,932
- Only like,

389
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:44,937
a handful more months, guys.

390
00:10:44,937 --> 00:10:46,717
- Oh my gosh.
- We're about halfway there.

391
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:47,550
- That's so crazy.

392
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,126
- A huge thank you to Spoonful One

393
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:50,844
for sponsoring today's video.

394
00:10:50,844 --> 00:10:52,586
I've loved getting to know you guys,

395
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,177
I've loved talking to you guys.

396
00:10:54,177 --> 00:10:55,530
I think it's really important that

397
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,942
we talk about food allergies.

398
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:58,155
I'm grateful for our platform

399
00:10:58,155 --> 00:10:59,988
and that we can share this with you.

400
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:01,800
We're gonna go grab a little bite to eat.

401
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,737
- Ooh, sounds delicious!
- Where do we go

402
00:11:02,737 --> 00:11:04,346
in San Francisco?
- I don't know!

403
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:05,179
That's the thing,

404
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,776
there's so many restaurants
we couldn't pick one!

405
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:07,682
We couldn't.

406
00:11:07,682 --> 00:11:09,733
Could you imagine walking
outside like this?

407
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:11,342
In Utah right now?

408
00:11:11,342 --> 00:11:12,556
- It would be freezing!

409
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:14,273
- It feels so good outside

410
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,751
and it's 10 P.M.
- It's beautiful.

411
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:18,226
- I've loved San Francisco

412
00:11:18,226 --> 00:11:19,336
it's been great.

413
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:20,753
We've only been here for what,

414
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:22,108
12 hours tops?

415
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:23,947
Not even 12 hours.
- It's beautiful.

416
00:11:23,947 --> 00:11:25,452
- Yeah, and we love it here.

417
00:11:25,452 --> 00:11:26,808
We should definitely come back.

418
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,321
When we have more than 12 hours.

419
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,154
- Ahh!

420
00:11:29,154 --> 00:11:30,019
So much baby information,

421
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:31,054
so exciting!

422
00:11:31,054 --> 00:11:32,316
We're gonna go to bed.

423
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,496
Good night my baby baby boy!

424
00:11:34,496 --> 00:11:35,413
Good night!

425
00:11:36,420 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye, guys.
