1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:02,071
- We're going to meet our friend Andy.

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:05,315
- I feel like good things
can come from this.

3
00:00:05,315 --> 00:00:07,282
- Do you realize that
you helped save his life,

4
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:10,495
because he could've died
from crying, literally?

5
00:00:10,495 --> 00:00:12,644
To make him not cry.

6
00:00:12,644 --> 00:00:15,036
They saved his life.

7
00:00:15,036 --> 00:00:17,869
(emotional music)

8
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:25,294
- And I sticked it in there.

9
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:26,706
(laughing)

10
00:00:26,706 --> 00:00:28,099
- Good morning, my superheroes.

11
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:29,120
How are you, today?

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,953
- Good.

13
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:33,012
- Good, you look so good and so strong.

14
00:00:33,012 --> 00:00:35,599
So I want to tell what we're doing today.

15
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,881
We're going to meet our friend Andy.

16
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:39,868
Andy is about Calvin's age.

17
00:00:39,868 --> 00:00:43,344
He is going to tell us
his story with his family,

18
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,212
and we're going to play with him today.

19
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:46,045
- Okay.

20
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,852
- Okay, are you excited to play with Andy?

21
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:48,685
Awesome.

22
00:00:48,685 --> 00:00:49,518
Calvin?

23
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:50,351
- Is he a kid?

24
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,184
- He's a kid, yeah.

25
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,499
He's like Calvin's age.

26
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:53,332
- Oh.

27
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:54,906
- So you'll have a lot
of fun with him, okay?

28
00:00:54,906 --> 00:00:55,739
- Okay.

29
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:57,396
He looks like Toy Story.

30
00:00:57,396 --> 00:01:00,057
- Yeah, he has the name from Toy Story.

31
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:01,834
Last year when we did the food drive,

32
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:05,602
we met a very special
family, Andy's family,

33
00:01:05,602 --> 00:01:08,580
and we met them again
at Vit Summit this year,

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,782
me and my dad, and they
told us about Andy's story

35
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:15,066
in more depth and we are
going to visit them today,

36
00:01:15,066 --> 00:01:17,161
and we are going to talk
to Andy and play with Andy,

37
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:19,121
and we're going to talk with their family

38
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:22,129
and we're going to tell you their story.

39
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,962
(emotional music)

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,182
So we are here at the Whittaker household.

41
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:50,015
- Hi!

42
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:53,388
- We've got everyone back
here, and especially Andy!

43
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:54,221
Hey bud.

44
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,054
- Andy, say hi!

45
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:56,548
- Can you say hi?

46
00:01:56,548 --> 00:01:58,249
(laughing)

47
00:01:58,249 --> 00:02:00,868
Andy has been reaching for
the camera all day today.

48
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:01,743
He loves it.

49
00:02:01,743 --> 00:02:02,703
You like to blog, don't ya?

50
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,551
Do you want to blog for a minute?

51
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:05,451
Yeah?

52
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:06,284
- 'Kay.

53
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:08,551
- 'Kay, say hi guys!

54
00:02:08,551 --> 00:02:09,392
- Hi.

55
00:02:09,393 --> 00:02:10,226
- Hi.

56
00:02:13,285 --> 00:02:14,511
That is so sweet.

57
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:17,230
Like I mentioned before, we had met Heidi.

58
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,063
- Hi.

59
00:02:18,063 --> 00:02:18,896
- And Emory.

60
00:02:18,896 --> 00:02:19,729
- Hi.

61
00:02:19,729 --> 00:02:22,107
- And Robbie at the food drive

62
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,527
that we did with Ellie's family,

63
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,932
and then we met them again at Vit Summit,

64
00:02:25,932 --> 00:02:27,878
and every time that we've talked to them,

65
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:29,760
we've talked about Andy.

66
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,123
Andy is a very very special kid.

67
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:32,886
I'm getting emotional already.

68
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,483
- He just really wants to be,

69
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:37,039
you want to be the
highlight right now, huh?

70
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,872
(laughs)

71
00:02:37,872 --> 00:02:39,445
- So we were talking about Andy's story.

72
00:02:39,445 --> 00:02:41,342
So we came over to Whittakers' house.

73
00:02:41,342 --> 00:02:44,651
and we want them to share his story.

74
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:47,207
- I don't need to tell you how
special Ellie and Jared are,

75
00:02:47,207 --> 00:02:48,863
because you already know this,

76
00:02:48,863 --> 00:02:52,047
but to our family they mean so much.

77
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,290
When Andy was born, he was born with a lot

78
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,002
of health challenges, a lot
of problems with breathing.

79
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,510
He was in a lot of pain.

80
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,343
- [Jared] Hi buddy.

81
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:01,810
- Nothing was really
helping him until one day

82
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,945
when my daughter Emory figured out

83
00:03:03,945 --> 00:03:07,117
that if we turned on Ellie and
Jared, he would stop crying

84
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,859
and that he would be okay
while their video was on,

85
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,322
which seemed kind of crazy.

86
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:13,064
We tried other people's videos,

87
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:14,438
and it didn't have the same effect.

88
00:03:14,438 --> 00:03:17,229
It was just something
about Ellie and Jared,

89
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,976
and the crying would stop
and the suffering would stop

90
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:23,275
just during that time,
and so Ellie and Jared

91
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:25,410
got him through multiple surgeries.

92
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,385
They got him through so many hard times

93
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:31,096
and kind of our sanity
because it's really hard

94
00:03:31,096 --> 00:03:35,023
to have a baby who screams
24/7 for months at a time.

95
00:03:35,023 --> 00:03:37,005
Meeting them was so incredible

96
00:03:37,005 --> 00:03:38,508
but I really couldn't tell them,

97
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:41,135
I could never explain to them,
"No, you don't understand.

98
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:41,968
"You changed our lives.

99
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,802
"You helped this baby so much.

100
00:03:44,802 --> 00:03:47,565
"That there are no words, and
I know you're amazing people,

101
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,590
but you helped this baby so much!"

102
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,095
(laughing)

103
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:54,745
So I was so grateful for the
chance to just talk to Jared

104
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:57,386
just for a minute at Vit Summit and say,

105
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,211
"No, Jared. You need to listen!

106
00:04:00,211 --> 00:04:03,044
"Because this baby is really okay,

107
00:04:04,065 --> 00:04:05,918
"because of what you
and Ellie did for him,

108
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,478
"and you didn't even know it."

109
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,017
- When I heard that for the first time,

110
00:04:09,017 --> 00:04:10,832
I mean, my heart just sunk.

111
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:13,453
My heart just dropped, because
I couldn't believe that.

112
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,094
Something that Ellie and I would just do

113
00:04:15,094 --> 00:04:17,846
every single day would
have such an impact,

114
00:04:17,846 --> 00:04:19,363
but there's more to it than that.

115
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:22,919
As much as I like to hear that, it's very,

116
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,527
I mean, it's very very humbling.

117
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:28,313
There's more to it than
just that with Andy.

118
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:29,146
- I'm Tasha.

119
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:29,979
I'm Andy's mom.

120
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:32,875
For months, basically
up until Andy was born

121
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,893
I would have to come
over here during the day

122
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,640
while Robbie went to work,

123
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,597
because I could not take care of myself.

124
00:04:38,597 --> 00:04:39,512
I was in pain.

125
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:42,607
I was having gallbladder attacks.

126
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:47,453
I had to rely on everybody
to help take care of me,

127
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,240
because I was 27 weeks pregnant

128
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,058
when I got into the car crash.

129
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,216
- [Jared] Well, and even before that,

130
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:53,469
you had an appendectomy?

131
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,400
- Yeah, when I thought I
was pregnant with Andy,

132
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,685
I was (laughs), we were in the ER.

133
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:00,610
I was three and a half weeks and

134
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,110
they did the normal blood test

135
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:07,809
that they do when you go into the ER,

136
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:09,242
and they came in and they're like,

137
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,094
"Well, everything looks normal,

138
00:05:10,094 --> 00:05:12,112
"but you're pregnant, congratulations."

139
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,719
We're like, "What?"

140
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:14,730
(laughing)

141
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,675
They did some sort of
scan, and they came back,

142
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:18,644
and they're like, "You have appendicitis.

143
00:05:18,644 --> 00:05:20,625
"We have to do emergency
surgery or you're going

144
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:24,612
"to lose the baby, because it will burst."

145
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,275
So the next morning, they took me back

146
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:31,181
and did the surgery, and
I just remember thinking,

147
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,498
"I am so scared about the surgery,"

148
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:35,112
because a couple months before that,

149
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:37,902
we had had a miscarriage and emotionally,

150
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:40,029
I was still getting past that,

151
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:43,966
and I was so scared of
losing this baby too,

152
00:05:43,966 --> 00:05:46,226
because of this surgery.

153
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:48,683
Even from the start, Andy
was such a little fighter.

154
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,516
He made it through and

155
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,445
even from the beginning,
he's gone through so much,

156
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,528
but he still is fighting.

157
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,099
He's such a fighter.

158
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,713
- So when Andy was born, his
mom had been in a car accident,

159
00:06:03,713 --> 00:06:07,616
and for nearly three months,
she needed to be on Percocet.

160
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,214
She was in and out of the hospital.

161
00:06:09,214 --> 00:06:10,961
This was a day to day decision,

162
00:06:10,961 --> 00:06:12,754
because they were trying to decide

163
00:06:12,754 --> 00:06:14,657
between operating on Natasha

164
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:16,410
while she was seven months pregnant

165
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,947
or trying to ride it out
on prescription drugs,

166
00:06:20,947 --> 00:06:24,447
and we met with pediatric pharmacologists.

167
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:28,863
I mean, there was a big
decision process made.

168
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,287
Would it be safe to wait?

169
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:31,694
Would it be harder on the baby?

170
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:32,760
Would it be harder on Natasha?

171
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,962
And the decision was made to have her be

172
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:38,529
on Percocet and other opiates
for almost three months

173
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:42,284
until Andy could be born, and
then to have surgery on her,

174
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:44,437
but we knew when he was born,

175
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,036
that he would be going
through drug withdrawals.

176
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,403
That's what we were expecting.

177
00:06:48,403 --> 00:06:51,573
What we were not expecting
was him to be born

178
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:53,925
with really serious birth defects

179
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:56,952
in his airway and in his jaw.

180
00:06:56,952 --> 00:07:01,035
So after Andy was born,
we found out that he had,

181
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,002
it's a disease called laryngomalacia,

182
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:07,032
which means there's too much
skin right above his larynx.

183
00:07:07,032 --> 00:07:10,721
It would close in on him, and
it would cut off his airway,

184
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:15,114
but also because his jaw
was small and misshapen,

185
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:18,415
it pushed his tongue back all
the way back into his airway,

186
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,778
and so when he would go to sleep,

187
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,268
it was almost like he was
swallowing his tongue.

188
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:24,438
His tongue would fill
his airway completely,

189
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:26,009
and he would not be able to breathe.

190
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,712
So we actually had to hold
him in a certain position

191
00:07:28,712 --> 00:07:31,045
to keep his airway open all night long

192
00:07:31,045 --> 00:07:32,522
until we could have surgery.

193
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:34,499
Or he, until he could have the surgery,

194
00:07:34,499 --> 00:07:35,806
but it was really complicated,

195
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:38,924
because they took CAT scans of his jaw,

196
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,814
and then they had to send those CAT scans

197
00:07:40,814 --> 00:07:43,137
to a company in Colorado that built

198
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:46,387
a computer-generated version of his jaw

199
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:50,502
and showing the doctors exactly

200
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:53,001
what needed to be done
to reshape it properly

201
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,480
and send those back to Salt Lake City.

202
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,538
So he was actually
hospitalized for quite a while

203
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,442
while we were waiting for the
ability to do surgery on him.

204
00:08:01,442 --> 00:08:03,692
- I remember the day I knew

205
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,862
that he needed the surgery.

206
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,664
This was before he had been admitted,

207
00:08:10,664 --> 00:08:14,831
for weeks before the surgery,
like Heidi was saying.

208
00:08:15,806 --> 00:08:20,427
Fact, I think the next day
was when he was admitted

209
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,417
for about a month beforehand,

210
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:25,334
and I was sitting there holding him

211
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,852
and we were actually
watching your channel.

212
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:33,019
I just got this horrible
feeling like my baby was dead,

213
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,502
and I was holding him.

214
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:38,445
I was watching him.

215
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:39,278
He was alive.

216
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,421
He was breathing, but it
felt like he was gone,

217
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:43,254
and

218
00:08:44,154 --> 00:08:45,437
I

219
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:47,582
literally heard a vocie in my head say,

220
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:51,901
"If you do not get this surgery,
that is what will happen."

221
00:08:51,901 --> 00:08:53,028
And I called Robbie immediately,

222
00:08:53,028 --> 00:08:55,262
and he said he had just
felt the same thing.

223
00:08:55,262 --> 00:08:57,265
- Told my boss that I felt
like I needed to go home.

224
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:59,098
He was very supportive

225
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:03,066
and then two hours later,

226
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:06,659
we had to call Primary Children's,

227
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:09,948
and they sent us to the ER
and admitted us that night.

228
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:12,611
- And we were there for about two weeks

229
00:09:12,611 --> 00:09:17,491
before they had the mandibles
so they could do the surgery.

230
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,220
It was honestly one of
the strongest feelings

231
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,705
I have ever had.

232
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,623
- There's no way to prepare
for what it's going to be like

233
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:25,756
to have a baby who's going
through drug withdrawal.

234
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:26,910
They're in pain.

235
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,600
It's like even though it's a mental thing,

236
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,733
they're in physical pain

237
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,089
when they don't have
that drug inside of them.

238
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:34,288
- [Tasha] It's awful.

239
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:36,810
- That's where Emory comes in,

240
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,036
because Emory had heard
about Ellie and Jared

241
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:43,262
when she went to CVX Live
and fallen in love with them

242
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:45,619
and had gone back to the very first videos

243
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,356
and had started watching
them from the very beginning

244
00:09:48,356 --> 00:09:49,934
and decided she was
going to lay on the floor

245
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:52,811
with this newborn baby
and watch Ellie and Jared,

246
00:09:52,811 --> 00:09:55,075
and that's when she figured out

247
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:59,498
that if she turned on their
videos he would stop screaming.

248
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:03,981
Just stop, and he would watch,
and he would be all happy.

249
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:06,184
And as soon as a video was over,
he'd start screaming again,

250
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:07,759
so she'd turned on the next one.

251
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,867
And then they became a part
of our lives 24 hours a day.

252
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,908
(laughing)

253
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,914
Because babies who are going
through drug withdrawal,

254
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:15,868
they don't sleep.

255
00:10:15,868 --> 00:10:16,701
They just scream.

256
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,244
So they're our family,

257
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:21,176
because they live with us all the time.

258
00:10:21,176 --> 00:10:24,050
- They don't know us
but they live with us.

259
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,202
- Whether you want us

260
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:27,284
to be your roommates or not, we're here.

261
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:28,752
(laughing)

262
00:10:28,752 --> 00:10:31,271
- There isn't a day that I
don't think about your family.

263
00:10:31,271 --> 00:10:33,195
Not one day that I don't think about you,

264
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:36,283
that I don't acknowledge the fact

265
00:10:36,283 --> 00:10:39,954
that you're a blessing
in our lives and that,

266
00:10:39,954 --> 00:10:41,671
'cause honestly I don't.

267
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:42,979
I guess one thing I didn't explain

268
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:46,239
to you is what happens when he cries,

269
00:10:46,239 --> 00:10:48,115
and maybe this is where you understand

270
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,495
how you helped save his life,

271
00:10:49,495 --> 00:10:51,082
and I mean that sincerely.

272
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:54,690
A baby with laryngomalacia,
if they cry, they can die,

273
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:58,145
because when they cry, their
airway gets so occluded,

274
00:10:58,145 --> 00:10:59,708
and it won't come back up again.

275
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:03,354
So you do everything that you
can to keep them from crying,

276
00:11:03,354 --> 00:11:05,001
which is why they get spoiled,

277
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:06,323
but you do everything you can to keep them

278
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:08,344
from crying because it's so dangerous

279
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:11,801
and when we took him in to see the doctor,

280
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:14,220
he said, "Don't let him cry."

281
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,292
- And he's a newborn.

282
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,760
- You tell me not to let
a drug addicted baby,

283
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,923
don't let a drug addicted baby cry,

284
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:23,000
you might as well be saying,
"Hold the tide back,"

285
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,714
because that doesn't happen,
and so for you to come

286
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:28,859
into his life and make him not cry,

287
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,666
do you realize that you
helped save his life,

288
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,170
because he could've died
from crying, literally?

289
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:38,235
So for your family to
come on our TV screen

290
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:41,361
or on the telephone, or on the cell phone,

291
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:43,361
and to make him not cry,

292
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,744
to make him not cry,

293
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:52,039
they saved his life, because
his dad used to do that,

294
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,587
and if his dad would cry hard enough,

295
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,637
we'd have to call the
paramedics and resuscitate him.

296
00:11:56,637 --> 00:11:58,310
It's that big of a deal.

297
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,649
- And that was ribs or?

298
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:02,123
- Yeah, if you were to look at my ribcage,

299
00:12:02,123 --> 00:12:05,312
it's shaped like this, instead
of like a standard ribcage,

300
00:12:05,312 --> 00:12:07,340
just because of how many
times the compressions

301
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,739
that they've done, they're just broken.

302
00:12:08,739 --> 00:12:11,316
- You can feel it just by
putting your hand on his chest.

303
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:12,149
You can feel that.

304
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:12,982
- [Jared] That's crazy.

305
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:17,024
Tell me about life right now with Andy.

306
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:20,907
- It's wonderful and
scary at the same time.

307
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,011
He stops breathing about 27 times a night,

308
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,597
and sometimes it's just
really short periods.

309
00:12:27,597 --> 00:12:31,068
Other times he has to
wake himself up, gasper,

310
00:12:31,068 --> 00:12:32,770
and catch a breath.

311
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:35,289
He's on oxygen anytime he's asleep.

312
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,491
He wears a cannula all the time,

313
00:12:36,491 --> 00:12:39,079
because you rip it off, it hurts.

314
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:39,912
- His poor face.

315
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:41,115
- [Heidi] His poor face.

316
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:44,514
- He's had a cannula on
for almost two years now,

317
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,436
and his face is just so--

318
00:12:46,436 --> 00:12:49,154
- Red where the tape marks are
- Red and raw.

319
00:12:49,154 --> 00:12:51,162
We've tried so many different options.

320
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,829
- The thing is with Andy is that

321
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,775
you just have to be in
the right frame of mind,

322
00:12:58,775 --> 00:12:59,949
because you don't know about tomorrow,

323
00:12:59,949 --> 00:13:02,338
and no one knows about
tomorrow with their lives.

324
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:05,761
Things can happen, but
with him, we don't know

325
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:08,631
about tomorrow and we've
been told in confidence.

326
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:12,590
We had one doctor pull
Robbie aside and he said

327
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,014
he didn't believe that the right tests

328
00:13:15,014 --> 00:13:15,964
were being done at that moment.

329
00:13:15,964 --> 00:13:17,767
He didn't agree with what was happening.

330
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:18,644
He pulled Robbie aside.

331
00:13:18,644 --> 00:13:21,859
He said, he basically said,
"You're up against a time clock

332
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:25,709
"right now, and you've
gotta get this diagnosed

333
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,498
"before time runs out for him,

334
00:13:27,498 --> 00:13:29,230
"and that hasn't happened yet."

335
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,352
To have someone pull you aside to say,

336
00:13:32,352 --> 00:13:34,140
"I think that there's
something really wrong,

337
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,246
"and I don't think your
baby's going to live

338
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:38,034
"if you don't really pursue this hard

339
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:41,252
"and get something done,"
it was a hard thing to take.

340
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:43,674
- The thing that I asked,
"What's life like now?"

341
00:13:43,674 --> 00:13:48,547
Because you said he still stops
breathing 27 times a night.

342
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:49,872
Andy's not better yet.

343
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:50,779
- No, he's not.

344
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:53,635
- No, and his heart has
become involved now.

345
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:56,211
So that's the hard thing
is that not only is

346
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:59,448
his brain not sending the signal
for him to breath at night,

347
00:13:59,448 --> 00:14:01,966
sometimes it doesn't send
the signal for his heart

348
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,158
to beat the way it should,
(baby crying)

349
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:04,991
so he's not regulating

350
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:07,217
his heartbeat or his oxygen levels either.

351
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:11,050
The big concern with
the gene that they think

352
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,159
might be involved is that
his brain just will not tell

353
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,495
his heart to beat one day,
and he just won't wake up.

354
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:23,031
- So where we're at now is
they know that his brain

355
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:26,898
isn't sending the signal to
his heart to beat properly

356
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:30,358
at times and to breath
and to monitor his oxygen,

357
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:32,214
but they don't know why, and we're kind of

358
00:14:32,214 --> 00:14:34,851
in this limbo point where we're waiting

359
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:37,433
for test results to come back.

360
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,399
- We're testing them.

361
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,472
- More testing to be done.

362
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:41,935
- But nobody knows anything.

363
00:14:41,935 --> 00:14:45,503
They've never seen a child
like our child anywhere near.

364
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,583
No doctor around here knows anything.

365
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,981
- And they said that Andy's
best bet at this point is

366
00:14:50,981 --> 00:14:54,558
for us to find another
kid that has identical

367
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:57,880
or even very similar
symptoms to what Andy has.

368
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,255
That's our best bet of being able

369
00:14:59,255 --> 00:15:01,283
to get this properly diagnosed.

370
00:15:01,283 --> 00:15:03,537
- And that's why we're here.

371
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:05,370
That's why, I mean, we

372
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:09,713
obviously feel a small
personal connection to this.

373
00:15:09,713 --> 00:15:11,668
Every time we've talked,
I think we've cried,

374
00:15:11,668 --> 00:15:14,634
but hearing the story from you guys

375
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:17,022
and then, we have an audience.

376
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:19,814
We have people who have kids
that may or may not be going

377
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:23,913
through this, and we want
to share this story with you

378
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:26,842
to see if you know of anyone
who's gone through this

379
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:31,009
or is going through this
to give this boy a chance.

380
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:35,299
To give your kid a chance,
because the more kids

381
00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:38,562
who have this can be tested for this,

382
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,096
the more doctors will know about this,

383
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:42,219
the more chances that Andy

384
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:46,077
and other kids like him
will have to survive,

385
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,067
and what was it that you said

386
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:51,337
with the SIDS that four thousand kids?

387
00:15:51,337 --> 00:15:55,266
- The airway condition I
had, it was in the trachea.

388
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:56,099
- [Heidi] In the larynx.

389
00:15:56,099 --> 00:16:00,080
- I had both in the
larynx and the trachea.

390
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,769
The year I was born, they had
about 1200 kids diagnosed.

391
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,607
About half of them were
diagnosed post mortem,

392
00:16:06,607 --> 00:16:08,677
just to rule our SIDS.

393
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:11,234
And then out of the other half of us

394
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:13,228
that were diagnosed while we were alive,

395
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,012
there were only a couple
of us that survived.

396
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:17,881
We were all under the
care of the same doctor.

397
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:19,324
- [Jared] Literally, a couple of you?

398
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,305
- Just literally.

399
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:22,252
There was me and a little girl from Idaho

400
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:23,188
that they Life Flighted

401
00:16:23,188 --> 00:16:26,697
to Primary Children's at Salt Lake City.

402
00:16:26,697 --> 00:16:29,280
And it was divine intervention.

403
00:16:31,504 --> 00:16:35,870
We've gotten better at
diagnosing in the medical world,

404
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:37,541
but it's still not a very high chance.

405
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,332
It's more of guess work.

406
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,593
If you see these things, you
bring them to the hospital

407
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:44,532
and we see if we stabilize the kid.

408
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:45,365
Does that make sense?

409
00:16:45,365 --> 00:16:46,375
- Yeah, absolutely.

410
00:16:46,375 --> 00:16:49,711
So we wanted to bring their
story to your attention,

411
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:53,546
and we wanted to see if there's
anything that we can do.

412
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,879
So what to do next if you know anything,

413
00:16:57,813 --> 00:17:00,004
if you have anything that
you would like to share

414
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,799
or if you want to even know
more about the Whittakers story,

415
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,016
Andy's story, I'm going
to have their channel

416
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:07,426
linked in the description
down below and in the card.

417
00:17:07,426 --> 00:17:10,949
This is a difficult time and
this has been a daily thing

418
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,403
for you for two years now,
and you've definitely had

419
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:18,853
your ups and downs, but I
mean, we have an audience,

420
00:17:18,853 --> 00:17:21,482
and we want to help, and I think
that's one of the best ways

421
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:25,649
that we can help is to get
information out to the world,

422
00:17:26,936 --> 00:17:28,108
I mean, that's why we're here.

423
00:17:28,108 --> 00:17:30,092
That's what we want to do for you guys.

424
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,409
I've been touched by
your story and by Andy,

425
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:35,853
and I want to make sure that
we do what we can to help.

426
00:17:35,853 --> 00:17:37,202
Like I said, all of their information

427
00:17:37,202 --> 00:17:38,035
will be in the description down below.

428
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,868
(emotional music)

429
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,501
Meeting with the Whittakers
and talking made me

430
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:56,552
just so grateful for all of the blessings

431
00:17:56,552 --> 00:18:00,498
that we have every single
day, and not only that,

432
00:18:00,498 --> 00:18:03,539
it made me recognize and see how grateful

433
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:07,238
they were for every single day too,

434
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:10,179
especially every single day
that they have with Andy.

435
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,673
He is such a sweet little boy.

436
00:18:12,673 --> 00:18:14,748
He is so happy.
- He loves to blog.

437
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,575
- Yes, he loved grabbing
the camera and blogging.

438
00:18:17,575 --> 00:18:19,864
It was fun to be with them.

439
00:18:19,864 --> 00:18:21,006
It was emotional.

440
00:18:21,006 --> 00:18:22,731
- We met them a year ago,

441
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:24,247
but today we were actuallyable to sit down

442
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:26,671
and talk with them more
and this is something

443
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,281
that they definitely want.

444
00:18:28,281 --> 00:18:29,852
They want their story out there.

445
00:18:29,852 --> 00:18:32,363
They want to be able to get answers.

446
00:18:32,363 --> 00:18:35,192
They're really hoping that with our reach,

447
00:18:35,192 --> 00:18:37,447
that somebody will have what is going on

448
00:18:37,447 --> 00:18:40,840
or know any more information
that can help them,

449
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,306
and so this was an emotional
day, and this is kind of

450
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:47,499
an emotional blog, but
I feel like good things

451
00:18:47,499 --> 00:18:48,715
can come from this,

452
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:51,410
and our friends, they
definitely have approved

453
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:54,675
the video, the thumbnail, the title.

454
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,602
They want this out there.

455
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,215
They want their story to be heard,

456
00:18:58,215 --> 00:19:03,087
and like she said today, it
is rough as it is and hard,

457
00:19:03,087 --> 00:19:05,746
but it needs to be blunt,
and it needed to be said,

458
00:19:05,746 --> 00:19:10,574
and I'm grateful that they,
that we found each other.

459
00:19:10,574 --> 00:19:13,929
I love feeling their
warm spirit welcoming us,

460
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:16,879
and I feel very humble that they have felt

461
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:21,129
that way about us, and
it makes me grateful.

462
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:24,315
- Yeah, I mean, I just think about

463
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:27,776
if there is something out there,

464
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:30,809
what that could potentially mean.

465
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:34,059
If Andy's condition gets taken care of,

466
00:19:35,691 --> 00:19:37,691
could that be a segue to

467
00:19:39,153 --> 00:19:41,232
helping or curing SIDS?

468
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:44,693
I mean, think of all of the
people that this could help.

469
00:19:44,693 --> 00:19:46,348
- That's definitely what
his grandma believes.

470
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:49,286
She's like, "I really feel
like there's a lot of things

471
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:51,172
"that are not being answered right now

472
00:19:51,172 --> 00:19:52,905
"that doctors could look into,

473
00:19:52,905 --> 00:19:55,208
"and they said the time is ticking,"

474
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,776
and they're really hoping

475
00:19:56,776 --> 00:20:00,776
that this can be a blessing
for a lot of people.

476
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:04,224
- I mean, that's why--
- It's very personal,

477
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:08,831
and it's very scary to share
stuff, especially like this,

478
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,506
but there's a lot of unknown answers,

479
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:12,403
and like I said, they really would love.

480
00:20:12,403 --> 00:20:13,993
So if anyone has any information,

481
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:16,415
you know where the email is

482
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:19,156
and we'll leave their channel
- We'll have their

483
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:20,116
- And their videos.
- In the description.

484
00:20:20,116 --> 00:20:22,874
- They have more videos
talking about this as well.

485
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:26,546
It's hard to make so much
into one little video,

486
00:20:26,546 --> 00:20:30,007
so definitely watch theirs,
and we love you guys,

487
00:20:30,007 --> 00:20:31,577
and we can't wait to hang out again,

488
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:34,025
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

489
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:35,586
- Thank you for watching.

490
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:36,754
We'll see you later Andy.

491
00:20:36,754 --> 00:20:38,362
Have a wonderful day.
- Bye Andy.

492
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,092
- Bye.
- Bye.

493
00:20:40,092 --> 00:00:00,000
(emotional music)
