1
00:00:00,652 --> 00:00:03,319
(phone ringing)

2
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:05,579
- [Mom] Hello.

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:06,635
- Hi, mom, how are you?

4
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:07,975
- [Mom] I'm good. How are you?

5
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,808
- Good.

6
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:10,551
Hey, I've got a quick question for you.

7
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:14,150
Can you think of any embarrassing stories

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,065
from when I was in school?

9
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:17,791
- [Mom] The twins in kindergarten.

10
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,106
- Yeah?

11
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:20,663
- [Mom] I don't know if
you felt embarrassed,

12
00:00:20,663 --> 00:00:23,747
but I was ready to rip those girls apart.

13
00:00:23,747 --> 00:00:25,601
(laughs)

14
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:28,184
(upbeat music)

15
00:00:33,196 --> 00:00:35,863
(alarm ringing)

16
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,705
(playful music)

17
00:01:18,103 --> 00:01:21,368
(rooster crowing)

18
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:22,201
- Good morning, guys.

19
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,922
Welcome to a normal hour of the vlog.

20
00:01:24,922 --> 00:01:27,045
Ellie is out running an errand right now,

21
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,765
and the kids are still asleep,

22
00:01:28,765 --> 00:01:30,791
so I thought it would be
a great time to clean up

23
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:33,461
as much as I possibly
can while Ellie is gone

24
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:36,280
so she comes home to a nice, clean house.

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,113
(energetic music)

26
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:57,636
(gasps)

27
00:01:57,636 --> 00:02:00,386
(dramatic music)

28
00:02:02,777 --> 00:02:04,602
I'll just worry about that later.

29
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:07,435
(energetic music)

30
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:18,620
(snaps fingers)

31
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,329
Hi, Ellie, welcome home.

32
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:21,238
- Thank you, Jared.

33
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:22,816
- Could you tell a difference?

34
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:23,893
- I walked in the house.

35
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:27,507
I was like, "Jared, this looks
so beautiful, thank you".

36
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:30,618
I seriously had to run a crazy errand.

37
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:34,368
We're doing something very
fun in this spot, guys.

38
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,451
I have loved everything we have done,

39
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:40,621
but I do feel like we
need some color in here,

40
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,582
and my friend is amazing at painting,

41
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:45,152
and that's all I'm gonna tell you,

42
00:02:45,152 --> 00:02:46,311
but I had to run an errand.

43
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,144
- [Jared] Suspense.

44
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:49,848
- [Ellie] But this whole
space is gonna be beautiful

45
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:51,029
in about a week.

46
00:02:51,029 --> 00:02:54,205
- It's a painting of me, isn't it?

47
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:55,627
- [Ellie] Perfect.

48
00:02:55,627 --> 00:02:57,032
- Let's go back to this morning.

49
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:58,082
I have to be so quiet.

50
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:00,359
I wanna show you this first.

51
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,109
(gentle lullaby)

52
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:06,522
Calvin is a stinker.

53
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,107
That is the only way I can describe him.

54
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,185
He is a stinker, not only with his poops,

55
00:03:10,185 --> 00:03:11,474
but with his actions.

56
00:03:11,474 --> 00:03:14,647
This morning, I think, at
three o'clock, four o'clock,

57
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:17,896
five o'clock, he got up,
and he didn't just get up.

58
00:03:17,896 --> 00:03:20,127
He was up, and he was staying up,

59
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:21,389
and we tried to put him back to bed,

60
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,818
and he just would not do it.

61
00:03:22,818 --> 00:03:26,373
- I swear this is the story
of Ellie and Jared's life.

62
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,055
- [Jared] Seriously.

63
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:29,333
- It was four in the morning,

64
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,520
and I was like, "What the
heck," and I came out here,

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,976
and he was just on the
floor playing with toys

66
00:03:33,976 --> 00:03:36,855
in the living room, just up and at 'em.

67
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:38,980
- Yeah, and he's like,
"I'm not going back to bed.

68
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,183
"I'm up for the day".

69
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:42,834
What was it: 7:30, eight
o'clock, he's like,

70
00:03:42,834 --> 00:03:44,618
"Okay, I'm gonna go to sleep now".

71
00:03:44,618 --> 00:03:46,559
Got up on the couch, pulled
the blanket over him,

72
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,693
and he went to sleep, which is like the--

73
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:51,776
- Calvin, you are best and the worst.

74
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:54,912
- Exactly.

75
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:56,729
I mean, four o'clock to what?

76
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,368
Eight o'clock, and now it's 10 o'clock,

77
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,680
and he's still asleep.

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,513
- [Ellie] Turd.

79
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:01,346
- Thank goodness.

80
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:02,477
You are a turd, but I love you.

81
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:04,493
- I'm really hoping their AC is broken.

82
00:04:04,493 --> 00:04:05,654
(laughs)

83
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:08,820
- We will not turn the AC on.

84
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,519
- We are in Frank, guys--

85
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,689
- [Jared] Hi, Frank.

86
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,280
- Bonnie's house is so cold.

87
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,512
You Cullen and Brian, Katie,
and Missy would all get along

88
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,757
very well, because they all like it cold,

89
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:22,803
and Jared and I are like,
"We want it a sauna".

90
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:25,303
- Please keep it warm. Please.

91
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:27,684
Boo!

92
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,517
Dang it.

93
00:04:28,517 --> 00:04:29,350
- [Bonnie] It wasn't scary.

94
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,183
I knew you were back here.

95
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:31,016
- You knew?

96
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:32,677
Just, I went for it. I went for it.

97
00:04:32,677 --> 00:04:34,225
- I said lunch was gross.

98
00:04:34,225 --> 00:04:35,244
(laughs)

99
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,061
- One of the best parts
about being a parent

100
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:39,336
is being able to
introduce to your own kids

101
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:41,648
the things that you loved as a kid,

102
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:43,242
and we've been doing that lately.

103
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:44,771
What have we been watching?

104
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:45,604
- Care Bears.

105
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:47,541
- [Jared] Care Bears, and
where do Care Bears live?

106
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:48,374
- Care-a-Lot.

107
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:51,770
- Yeah, as a kid, my family
and I, we watched Care Bears.

108
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,434
We loved the movies, so Care
Bears has a special place

109
00:04:54,434 --> 00:04:57,129
in my heart, because I
grew up on it as a kid,

110
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,145
and, this year, Care Bears are celebrating

111
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,357
their 35th anniversary.

112
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,230
Now, to celebrate this 35th anniversary,

113
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,038
Care Bears is announcing a limited edition

114
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:08,333
rainbow heart bear.

115
00:05:08,333 --> 00:05:09,619
Do you wanna see it?

116
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:10,452
- Yeah.

117
00:05:10,452 --> 00:05:11,347
- [Jared] K, ready?

118
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:12,696
- What?

119
00:05:12,696 --> 00:05:14,446
- [Jared] Here it is.

120
00:05:15,719 --> 00:05:17,566
Does that look so cool?

121
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:18,399
Aw.

122
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:22,778
Can you give him a hug, Calvin?

123
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:24,476
Yeah, do you see that?

124
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:26,653
What do you think of his belly badge?

125
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:27,607
- It's cool.

126
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:28,440
- [Jared] Yeah.

127
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,811
- It shoots power.

128
00:05:29,811 --> 00:05:30,644
- It does.

129
00:05:30,644 --> 00:05:32,547
That's right.

130
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:33,880
Care Bear stare!

131
00:05:34,898 --> 00:05:37,479
Every year, on September
9th, Care Bears celebrate

132
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:40,241
their national holiday,
Share Your Care Day.

133
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:42,315
Share Your Care Day is
all about celebrating

134
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:44,781
acts of kindness whether
they're big or small,

135
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:48,682
whether you're helping your
mom, helping your brother,

136
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,636
or helping someone across the
street with their groceries,

137
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:52,481
anything at all.

138
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,161
It's all about celebrating kindness,

139
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,990
and that's exactly what we
like to do with our friends

140
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,779
and family and those around the world.

141
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:01,200
This year, Care Bears is
celebrating Share Your Care Day

142
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,984
in Los Angeles,
California, and guess what?

143
00:06:03,984 --> 00:06:04,996
- What?

144
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:09,389
- Jackson, they invited
you and Calvin and us

145
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:10,629
to go celebrate.

146
00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:12,150
- [Jared] We're gonna get on an airplane,

147
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,797
and we're gonna fly to California,

148
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,283
and we're gonna celebrate
Share Your Care Days

149
00:06:15,283 --> 00:06:16,353
with the Care Bears.

150
00:06:16,353 --> 00:06:17,846
- I wanna go to Care-a-Lot.

151
00:06:17,846 --> 00:06:18,909
- [Jared] You wanna go to Care-a-Lot?

152
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:19,742
- Yeah!

153
00:06:19,742 --> 00:06:20,575
- Let's do it!

154
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:22,627
Not only that; we're
actually going to have

155
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:26,046
a very special meet and greet
at that event in Los Angeles.

156
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:27,704
I'll have all of the information listed

157
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,378
in the description down below.

158
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:30,845
It's gonna be a great time,

159
00:06:30,845 --> 00:06:32,743
and we would love to see you there.

160
00:06:32,743 --> 00:06:34,550
If you guys would like to get
your own rainbow heart bear,

161
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:36,919
they have them at Walmart,
Kmart, Toys "R" Us,

162
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,800
and QVC until December.

163
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,762
(gentle music)
That's good.

164
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:45,929
Got it.
(gentle music)

165
00:06:46,934 --> 00:06:48,687
Okay, I have to print out some papers,

166
00:06:48,687 --> 00:06:50,874
and some of those papers
are for passports,

167
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:53,241
and I'll tell you about
those a little bit later,

168
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:56,455
but the short story is
our printer that we've had

169
00:06:56,455 --> 00:06:59,441
for, I don't know, six
years, or ever since

170
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,521
we were in college,
finally ran out of ink,

171
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,810
but we don't print that
much, because everything

172
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:06,074
is done electronically
now, and I went to go print

173
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:09,466
some of this stuff, these
papers out, no ink whatsoever.

174
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,903
I went to the store today
and looked at ink costs,

175
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,956
and it was a much as a new printer,

176
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,440
so I was like, "Let's
just get a new printer

177
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,448
"that has, like, wi-fi and
all of that good stuff,"

178
00:07:18,448 --> 00:07:21,173
so I got this guy from Best Buy,

179
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,819
and it was a lot cheaper than the ink

180
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:24,917
and has all the cool stuff with it.

181
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,742
The goal is to have it set up down here

182
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:30,666
so it's out of the way still
being able to reach wi-fi,

183
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:33,247
and I can just print it down
here, if that's gonna work.

184
00:07:33,247 --> 00:07:34,392
Crossing our fingers.

185
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:36,975
(gentle music)

186
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,946
All right, we have movement.

187
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:47,383
It is printing out the test
and alignment pages right now.

188
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,154
I think there's two or
three of these bad boys,

189
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:52,205
so we'll take a gander
here in just a second.

190
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,858
All right, we've got our last page coming.

191
00:07:55,858 --> 00:08:00,025
- To Cullen and K-A-T-I-E, send.

192
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:07,020
- All right.

193
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,187
What the heck?

194
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:11,791
Subscribe to Cullen and Katie?

195
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,337
How is that even possible?

196
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:14,372
(laughs)

197
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:15,205
- Yes.

198
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:18,223
Let's go.

199
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:20,390
- [Jared] One, two, three.

200
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:26,125
- [Ellie] Get it, girl!

201
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:30,839
Don't let this image fool
you, this quiet image.

202
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,592
Two seconds ago, we
had two screaming kids.

203
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:36,912
- You mean, we're not like
the Cleavers all of the time?

204
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:37,948
- No.

205
00:08:37,948 --> 00:08:39,392
Are you all good now?

206
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,226
- Cookies.

207
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:41,058
- Cookie?

208
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,579
Wowsers, he was crying,
'cause Calvin wanted

209
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,525
to grab his cookie.

210
00:08:43,525 --> 00:08:44,586
He just woke up from a nap.

211
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:45,919
Calvin just woke up from a nap.

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:47,521
Our day today has kinda been a theme.

213
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:50,646
Wake up early, be cranky, and
we're gonna go to bed early

214
00:08:50,646 --> 00:08:52,513
and be cranky.

215
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:54,258
I've got dinner going.

216
00:08:54,258 --> 00:08:57,668
It is broccoli, pesto, and some noodles.

217
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:00,981
It called for some sausage,
which meat did not sound good

218
00:09:00,981 --> 00:09:04,978
at all, and I skipped that
out, and we're just doing this.

219
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:06,431
I just need to move it onto the plates,

220
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:07,927
and we are ready to eat.

221
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,193
I've been wanting to make peach pie.

222
00:09:10,193 --> 00:09:12,598
My family, when we were
starting some of the recipes

223
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:15,493
for the cookbook, we did
do some peach pie filling.

224
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:17,418
Ruby had went home and just made it,

225
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:21,095
and I'm so jealous, because
I want to eat some peach pie,

226
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:25,073
but I just haven't had it
in me to quite make it.

227
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:28,140
I may just eat peaches and
cream, and that may be it.

228
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,813
Do you guys like peaches and cream?

229
00:09:29,813 --> 00:09:30,832
I don't know if that's weird.

230
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:33,126
I feel like a lot of things
I do, some people are like,

231
00:09:33,126 --> 00:09:35,598
"That's kinda gross or
weird," but just like peaches,

232
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:38,912
milk, and a little tiny
bit of sugar on top.

233
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,413
Yes, no?

234
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,085
Anyway, I'm starving,
so we're gonna eat this.

235
00:09:42,085 --> 00:09:43,093
Color is that?

236
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:43,926
- [Calvin] Blue.

237
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:46,071
(laughs)

238
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:47,713
- Oh my gosh, I just grabbed the camera,

239
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,365
'cause Calvin came up, said, "Black".

240
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,497
We're learning our colors,
and then I just asked him,

241
00:09:52,497 --> 00:09:53,829
and he said, "Blue".

242
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,322
What color is this?

243
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:56,240
- Blue.

244
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,950
- [Ellie] You just said black.

245
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,444
Say, "Black".

246
00:09:59,444 --> 00:10:00,596
- Black.

247
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:02,054
- It is black.

248
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:03,447
(laughs)

249
00:10:03,447 --> 00:10:05,084
Color fail.

250
00:10:05,084 --> 00:10:07,397
He was so excited to tell
me that it was black,

251
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:08,663
and I was like, "That's right,"

252
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:11,609
'cause he always says everything is blue.

253
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:14,276
(phone ringing)

254
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,463
- [Mom] Hello.

255
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:17,711
- Hi, mom, how are you?

256
00:10:17,711 --> 00:10:19,014
- [Mom] I'm good. How are you?

257
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:19,847
- Good.

258
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:21,470
Hey, I've got a quick question for you.

259
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,908
Can you think of any embarrassing stories

260
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:26,934
from when I was in school?

261
00:10:26,934 --> 00:10:29,003
- [Mom] The twins in kindergarten.

262
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:29,929
- Yeah?

263
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,541
- [Mom] I don't know if
you felt embarrassed,

264
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,557
but I was ready to rip those girls apart.

265
00:10:34,557 --> 00:10:36,640
(laughs)

266
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:39,740
- That's awesome.

267
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,621
Well, okay, well, I just
wanted to call and ask.

268
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:42,594
Thanks, mom.

269
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:44,562
Okay, I have to give some
context to that story

270
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,741
that my mom and I were just talking about.

271
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:48,667
I was in kindergarten,
and the bus stop stopped

272
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:50,970
right outside my house,
so my mom would wait

273
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,889
right outside for us, and she would see us

274
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:55,496
as we were driving down,
and there were two twins,

275
00:10:55,496 --> 00:10:57,567
and I grew up with 'em.

276
00:10:57,567 --> 00:11:00,039
They're friends of mine,
but, in kindergarten,

277
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,367
they sat next to me almost
every single day on the bus,

278
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,107
and they sat on both sides
of me, and they would just

279
00:11:06,107 --> 00:11:08,714
kiss me on the cheek the whole time

280
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:12,259
I was riding my bus home,
and I would get off the bus,

281
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,905
and my face was just bright red--

282
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:16,713
- I think that's the cutest thing ever.

283
00:11:16,713 --> 00:11:17,546
- It is.

284
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,043
Well, it's just like my mom--
- I can picture them doing.

285
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,943
You're so cute.

286
00:11:21,943 --> 00:11:23,934
- Obviously, I can't remember
if I was embarrassed,

287
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:26,769
but my mom was like, "Those girls".

288
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,415
- Oh, I bet, I bet.

289
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:30,515
- I'm sure I liked it.

290
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,728
- I'm sure you did.

291
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:34,424
- I didn't get kissed after
that for years and years.

292
00:11:34,424 --> 00:11:35,496
- Jared asked me, he's like,

293
00:11:35,496 --> 00:11:38,330
"Ellie, was there an embarrassing
story of you in school,"

294
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,497
and I'm sure there are tons,
but, when I was in junior high,

295
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:47,493
and I totally went to a health
class for like three weeks

296
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:50,263
thinking it was a biology class, and then,

297
00:11:50,263 --> 00:11:53,263
after three weeks, the teacher
and I couldn't figure out

298
00:11:53,263 --> 00:11:56,784
why I wasn't on the roll,
and that was a ruckus.

299
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,640
- I remember you telling me that.

300
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,183
- But it was really getting
into the health stuff.

301
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:01,689
I'm like, "I think this is"--

302
00:12:01,689 --> 00:12:02,976
- You're like, "Wait a second".

303
00:12:02,976 --> 00:12:04,110
- This is not biology.

304
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,814
Anyway--
- That is so funny.

305
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,394
- Totally dumb.

306
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,841
- There's a couple more.

307
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,598
This is what sparked all of this up.

308
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:12,577
I posted an Instagram picture.

309
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:15,314
You can follow me on Instagram right here,

310
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:19,578
about memorable moments on
your first day of school,

311
00:12:19,578 --> 00:12:22,406
and then I was just like, "What
about our most embarrassing

312
00:12:22,406 --> 00:12:25,945
"stories at school," and,
speaking of that, your story,

313
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:27,722
I remember in college.

314
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:28,612
This is how bad it was.

315
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:33,309
In college, I forgot to go
to a lab the entire semester,

316
00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:35,230
and I felt so--
- You had a dream.

317
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,580
- Yeah, that is my worst
nightmare, and I think that's why.

318
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,413
- 'Cause you did it.

319
00:12:39,413 --> 00:12:40,246
- And I felt stupid.

320
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,271
I was so embarrassed.

321
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:44,032
I can't believe I forgot
to go to that class.

322
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:45,849
I ended up retaking it
just to get a better grade.

323
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:46,682
I did okay.

324
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,946
Like, I did okay without the lab,

325
00:12:47,946 --> 00:12:51,060
but I wanted to get a
better grade, so I did that,

326
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,759
but, second grade, you're
seven, eight years old

327
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:55,839
in second grade.

328
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,258
It was Winter time, and we
were having a snowball fight

329
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,489
outside, and the duties.

330
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:01,588
We called them duties.
- Yeah.

331
00:13:01,588 --> 00:13:03,072
- Do you? Supervisors.

332
00:13:03,072 --> 00:13:05,835
Anyway, the adults who were
outside when you have recess

333
00:13:05,835 --> 00:13:08,975
got really mad at us
and took us inside early

334
00:13:08,975 --> 00:13:13,448
and told our teacher, and our
teacher got really mad at us

335
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:14,743
for having a snowball fight.

336
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:15,576
Like, it wasn't bad.

337
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:18,143
- Oh, I was always in
trouble for snowball fights.

338
00:13:18,143 --> 00:13:21,030
- And they said, "You need to
go to the principal's office,"

339
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,530
and my heart sunk.

340
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:27,619
It just dropped to the
floor, because I was a kid.

341
00:13:27,619 --> 00:13:29,544
I never got in trouble in school.

342
00:13:29,544 --> 00:13:33,211
I was a good kid, and
anything remotely bad,

343
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:38,222
I just quivered and just
shriveled up into this little ball

344
00:13:39,436 --> 00:13:40,674
of fear--
- That happened to me.

345
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:44,320
I had to stay in recess for like a week

346
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,951
and write, "I will not throw snowballs,"

347
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,476
like a flipping thousand times,
and my mom ended up calling,

348
00:13:48,476 --> 00:13:50,709
and they're like, "She's not doing that".

349
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:52,133
After three days, she like, "She's done".

350
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,310
- Like Bart Simpson.

351
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,060
