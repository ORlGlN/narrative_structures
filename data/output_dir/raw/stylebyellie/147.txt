1
00:00:00,354 --> 00:00:01,825
- Should we show this off yet or no?

2
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:02,973
Isn't she so pretty?

3
00:00:02,973 --> 00:00:04,678
I love when she ahh!

4
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:06,198
Oh isn't this just sweet.

5
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:08,266
(gentle music)

6
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:10,715
(laughing)

7
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,965
(laughing)

8
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:17,806
we're gonna go go on an adventure.

9
00:00:17,806 --> 00:00:19,615
Gonna go go on an adventure.

10
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:22,401
Gonna go of on an adventure, gonna go.

11
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,496
What are you doing back here,

12
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:25,680
gathering up things?
- Rummaging through

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,808
- all our crap.

14
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:28,530
- [Jared] Oh no, not the rummaging.

15
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,781
- We have a huge day.

16
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:31,640
- [Jared] Yes we do.
- At Mom and Dad's,

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,557
- I think we're gonna do
like 10 or 13 recipes,

18
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:38,103
Dutch oven meals.

19
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,511
I'll see you tonight for fire.

20
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:40,344
- [Jared] Yes.

21
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:41,431
- Lots of work.

22
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,797
So I won't see you much today.

23
00:00:42,797 --> 00:00:44,937
- Which is why I'm here
to say goodbye to you,

24
00:00:44,937 --> 00:00:46,311
but I will see you a little bit later.

25
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,294
- Okay.

26
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,283
I love you.
- Have fun with your family.

27
00:00:48,283 --> 00:00:49,871
- That was a wimpy kiss I know, but

28
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:50,704
- Well you just put your lipstick on.

29
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:51,981
I know the business.

30
00:00:51,981 --> 00:00:53,409
I've been married to you.

31
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,598
- Oh I hear the kids.

32
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:56,765
- Quick, hide.

33
00:00:57,987 --> 00:00:59,669
Okay drive safe.

34
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:01,178
We'll see you later, I'll
see you this afternoon.

35
00:01:01,178 --> 00:01:03,610
Me and the boys are gonna do something fun

36
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,874
for a video while we're gone, okay?

37
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:08,530
And it involves you,
but not directly, okay?

38
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,341
It's gonna be fun Ellie.
- What?

39
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:11,174
- [Ellie] Tell me about it.

40
00:01:11,174 --> 00:01:12,780
- I'm not gonna tell you, it's a surprise.

41
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,781
(laughing)

42
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:15,434
Should we show this off yet or no?

43
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,888
- Yeah let's do it now, come here.

44
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:17,896
- Nah.

45
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,948
So we've had a lot of people
ask us about the Pacifica

46
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:21,813
and where the heck did it go.

47
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:23,798
A lot of you know that
we worked with Chrysler

48
00:01:23,798 --> 00:01:26,734
in promoting their new
Pacifica and we loved it.

49
00:01:26,734 --> 00:01:27,951
We loved working with Chrysler,

50
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,479
we loved the Pacifica.

51
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:32,646
It is by far my favorite
mini van of all time

52
00:01:32,646 --> 00:01:34,078
and I mean that sincerely.

53
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:35,453
- Oh absolutely.

54
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:36,822
- After the year was done,

55
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:39,159
we had the option of buying the van

56
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:40,933
and what it came down to was

57
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,135
during the wintertime,

58
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,038
we wanted a vehicle that
had all-wheel drive,

59
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:47,166
just to be a little bit
more safe while driving,

60
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:48,939
and so instead of driving that,

61
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:50,619
we bought this one instead.

62
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:52,115
- It was the hardest decision.

63
00:01:52,115 --> 00:01:52,955
- It really was.

64
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:54,291
- And that was the only thing

65
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:55,316
that was the only thing

66
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:58,372
was just we wanted four-wheel
drive for the snow.

67
00:01:58,372 --> 00:02:01,026
Because last year, the
van was good in the snow,

68
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,276
but we have a canyon
that we go through a lot

69
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:05,435
and it was kind of hard
to get through that.

70
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,971
- Yeah, so we still
recommend the Pacifica.

71
00:02:07,971 --> 00:02:10,250
It is my favorite mini van,

72
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,819
but we just wanted to tell
you what happened with it.

73
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,180
- Jared ended up finding
an awesome used car

74
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,284
with really low miles,

75
00:02:16,284 --> 00:02:18,611
so that's what we are with right now.

76
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:21,219
We really want to upgrade our blue one

77
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:23,358
and have a van, and then an SUV,

78
00:02:23,358 --> 00:02:26,030
so we'd have, like the van
would be our run around car.

79
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:26,863
- Yeah.

80
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,031
- So that's our end goal,

81
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,753
to go back to it

82
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:30,586
- To go back to it.
- Sometime.

83
00:02:30,586 --> 00:02:32,853
- So that's where we're at right now.

84
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,379
Some people had questions

85
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:35,212
and we figured we'd

86
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:36,713
answer them for you.
- And here are your answers.

87
00:02:36,713 --> 00:02:37,546
- Before I head out,

88
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:38,550
I want to show you guys

89
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,686
a little gift basket that
Jared and I put together

90
00:02:40,686 --> 00:02:43,134
for our builder and his wife,

91
00:02:43,134 --> 00:02:44,993
because we've been in
the house for a year,

92
00:02:44,993 --> 00:02:47,448
I really wanted to get them something

93
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:48,633
and it never happened.

94
00:02:48,633 --> 00:02:49,466
And I felt really bad.

95
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:51,305
But now that it's coming
up on the year mark,

96
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:53,186
I'm going to give them to them.

97
00:02:53,186 --> 00:02:55,082
I found them a little basket.

98
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:58,418
They each have an awesome
pair of dun winter socks.

99
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:01,068
These are some old-fashioned
cinnamon drops.

100
00:03:01,068 --> 00:03:03,189
We have a little house for them

101
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,145
and it's a little house to store garlic in

102
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,349
and I thought this was fitting,

103
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,708
because they built us a house,

104
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,574
so I bought them a teeny house.

105
00:03:10,574 --> 00:03:12,589
She has the little lipstick in here

106
00:03:12,589 --> 00:03:15,124
and the main thing that
we wanted to give them,

107
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:16,860
this was just kind of cutesy,

108
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,048
but what I wanted to give
them was a gift card,

109
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:22,165
and this is to a really
nice restaurant in town,

110
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:24,183
so that is for them

111
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:26,013
that we are gonna deliver today.

112
00:03:26,013 --> 00:03:28,086
- Are you stuck back there?

113
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:29,651
Yeah you're stuck?

114
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:32,236
Calvin's in jail, he put himself there.

115
00:03:32,236 --> 00:03:33,069
We'll get him in just a second.

116
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:34,542
But I have to show you,

117
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,661
look who's back from the groomers.

118
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:39,956
Isn't she so pretty, I love what she ahh!

119
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:41,828
I love when we get Penny groomed

120
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:42,774
and we groom Penny,

121
00:03:42,774 --> 00:03:45,139
because her fur is just so soft.

122
00:03:45,139 --> 00:03:47,659
And this time, because it's Halloween,

123
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,537
they got her this bandana that's

124
00:03:49,537 --> 00:03:53,147
all Halloween and festive
and everything and I love it.

125
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:57,266
And it reminds me of
when we had my dog Sam

126
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:58,678
as a kid, because every
time we would take him

127
00:03:58,678 --> 00:03:59,878
to the groomers, they
would always give him

128
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,782
this really nice blue or red handkerchief.

129
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:07,367
And our dog Peaches, which
was like a mini poodle,

130
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,308
she would always get bows in her ears.

131
00:04:09,308 --> 00:04:11,116
And so it's just takes me back

132
00:04:11,116 --> 00:04:12,364
to my childhood.

133
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:13,948
And I love that we're going through

134
00:04:13,948 --> 00:04:15,156
the experiences in life

135
00:04:15,156 --> 00:04:17,046
that bring me back to my childhood,

136
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:19,676
the wonderful times that I had growing up.

137
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:23,828
And I get to experience
that for myself again

138
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,083
and with the kids.

139
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:25,916
(laughs)

140
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,557
It's just fun to revisit those memories

141
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,831
and have them with our
kids for the first time.

142
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:33,331
(sweet music)

143
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:37,415
Hello my love.
- Hello.

144
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:39,908
- You are gonna love
what me and the boys did.

145
00:04:39,908 --> 00:04:40,805
I can't tell you right now,
- I can't wait.

146
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:42,747
but you'll find out soon, okay?

147
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,196
- Do you want to know what we got?

148
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:46,154
- [Jared] Don't tell her,

149
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:47,535
it's a secret.
- Daddy says to be quiet.

150
00:04:47,535 --> 00:04:49,488
- Everyone's gonna know about it.

151
00:04:49,488 --> 00:04:50,321
- [Jared] Sooner or later.

152
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,404
- I, we made, I, we all made cobbler,

153
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:55,987
cobbler,
- oh mmm.

154
00:04:55,987 --> 00:04:56,820
- Lasagna,

155
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,653
- [Jared] Get it.

156
00:04:57,653 --> 00:04:58,486
- Bread,
- Stop.

157
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:00,663
- Scones,
- Don't stop.

158
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:01,496
- Breakfast.

159
00:05:01,496 --> 00:05:02,513
- [Jared] Keep going.

160
00:05:02,513 --> 00:05:03,861
Breakfast, you made it?

161
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:04,694
- Ahhh!
- All of it?

162
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:05,527
- [Jared] You made all of the breakfast?

163
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:07,051
- We've been cooking all day.

164
00:05:07,051 --> 00:05:07,884
- Oh I can't wait.

165
00:05:07,884 --> 00:05:09,260
Wait, is any of this edible,

166
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,138
can we eat this?

167
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:15,358
Everyone in Ellie's family
had like old Geo Prism,

168
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:17,311
or Toyota Corollas, like the early 90s,

169
00:05:17,311 --> 00:05:21,395
like '93, '94, '95, those were the years.

170
00:05:21,395 --> 00:05:22,331
I thought I'd give you an idea

171
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,394
what the model is,

172
00:05:23,394 --> 00:05:26,366
and over the years, we
finally upgraded our cars

173
00:05:26,366 --> 00:05:28,444
and we all have some nice cars

174
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:31,606
and I just noticed all of
them are here right now,

175
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,189
all the newer ones

176
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:34,542
and there's a trend there,

177
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,941
and I don't know if this
is intentional or what,

178
00:05:36,941 --> 00:05:38,134
but it's pretty coincidental

179
00:05:38,134 --> 00:05:39,597
and pretty hilarious.

180
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:42,694
I think we all have a
favorite color of vehicle.

181
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,805
(laughs) What the heck?

182
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,981
Oh my gosh, this is so crazy.

183
00:05:46,981 --> 00:05:49,814
Except you old blue, old faithful.

184
00:05:51,412 --> 00:05:53,420
So today we are at Grandma
and Grandpa's house

185
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,876
and we are taking pictures

186
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,005
for the family cookbook that we're making.

187
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:57,972
I'm really excited about it.

188
00:05:57,972 --> 00:05:59,437
We've got everyone here

189
00:05:59,437 --> 00:06:03,381
and it's just fun to have
all of these scenes set up.

190
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,651
Got all the grandkids,

191
00:06:04,651 --> 00:06:06,100
most of the grandkids.

192
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,228
There's gonna be a few photo shoots,

193
00:06:07,228 --> 00:06:08,928
but this is photo shoot number one,

194
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:10,886
so it's like milestone.

195
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,065
- Hulla hulla.

196
00:06:12,065 --> 00:06:13,915
- Hulla hulla, hi.
- Hello.

197
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,748
(burps)

198
00:06:14,748 --> 00:06:16,032
- Oh excuse you.

199
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:18,755
(laughing)

200
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,665
And so we're just
jumping on the trampoline

201
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:23,534
to pass the time until the next shot.

202
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:24,367
Yeah, is that what we're doing?

203
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,450
(chill guitar music)

204
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,384
Look, when was the last time

205
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:02,252
you guys were all together?

206
00:07:02,252 --> 00:07:03,085
- It's been awhile.

207
00:07:03,085 --> 00:07:03,918
- It's been awhile, huh?
- A long time.

208
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,502
- When was the last time?

209
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:07,687
I guess I didn't realize that it has

210
00:07:07,687 --> 00:07:10,023
- [Jared] This is the
Griffiths right here.

211
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:12,882
- We went to the lake in June.

212
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:13,803
- Yeah.

213
00:07:13,803 --> 00:07:14,636
- [Jared] Yeah.

214
00:07:14,636 --> 00:07:15,852
- June, that wasn't too long ago,

215
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,135
- We made that big pizza.

216
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,603
- [Ellie] Five months ago.

217
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:20,451
- [Jared] Oh Calvin.

218
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,696
Who's kid is that?
- No no no no no.

219
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,214
- [Jared] Geez.

220
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:26,047
Seriously.

221
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:27,538
- What's happening Woody?

222
00:07:27,538 --> 00:07:28,968
- Are you hungry?

223
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:29,801
He's hungry.

224
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:30,634
- [Jared] He's hungry?

225
00:07:30,634 --> 00:07:32,157
Well I'm sorry, there's no food here.

226
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:33,210
- [Grandpa] Either that
or he hates gloves.

227
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,033
- Calvin's like no
sentimental moments allowed.

228
00:07:36,033 --> 00:07:37,149
We were reminiscing about the last time

229
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:38,371
you were all together,

230
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,204
and I'm gonna destroy it all.

231
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:40,932
Okay everyone get your legs together,

232
00:07:40,932 --> 00:07:42,525
we've gotta create the shade.

233
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:44,384
- [Woman] No that's actually great.

234
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:45,696
- Perfect.
- Okay okay.

235
00:07:45,696 --> 00:07:48,169
- [Photographer] So we're
wanting a picture of a

236
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,674
- [Jared] What we do to block shade.

237
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:54,257
(Jared laughs)

238
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,845
- Do you want to look
through those really fast?

239
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,795
- They're not hovering
over the photographer.

240
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:04,622
They're creating shade for
the photographer, I promise.

241
00:08:04,622 --> 00:08:07,789
(lively guitar music)

242
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,243
I don't want to move her very far.

243
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:40,076
- How about we put her with it?

244
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:40,909
- Okay.

245
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:45,994
- [Jared] What?

246
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,703
What?

247
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,356
Yeah.

248
00:08:50,356 --> 00:08:52,253
Those look so good.

249
00:08:52,253 --> 00:08:53,510
Go share.

250
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,466
Okay sing me a song first.

251
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:56,299
Sing me a song.

252
00:08:56,299 --> 00:08:57,689
♫ Yeah

253
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:58,772
Oh beautiful.

254
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:01,262
- [Jared] Yum.

255
00:09:07,042 --> 00:09:08,720
Oh isn't this just sweet.

256
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
Grandma passing out hot chocolate

257
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,553
to all the grandkids.

258
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:12,386
Isn't that sweet?

259
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,426
- Yes, all of our nerves are calmed down.

260
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:15,259
- [Jared] Good.

261
00:09:15,259 --> 00:09:18,655
- It's been a day full of time,

262
00:09:18,655 --> 00:09:19,488
food, fun.

263
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,525
- [Jared] Mmm-mmm.

264
00:09:22,525 --> 00:09:24,775
(laughing)

265
00:09:25,935 --> 00:09:26,852
- Your cup.

266
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,919
(laughing)

267
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,273
- Did you totally get that?

268
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,214
- [Jared] I totally did.

269
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:44,422
(Jared laughs)

270
00:09:44,422 --> 00:09:47,283
Ready, oh my gosh, oh no!

271
00:09:47,283 --> 00:09:50,107
- Ha ha, I want to do it again.

272
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:51,280
- [Jared] Hey that wasn't very nice,

273
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,654
it knocked me right over.

274
00:09:52,654 --> 00:09:54,254
- And that was quite a day,

275
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:55,745
I hope I was even able to capture

276
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,119
a little bit of that.

277
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:59,531
I really enjoyed being with my family.

278
00:09:59,531 --> 00:10:01,362
We had a lot of fun.

279
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:02,945
It is time for bed.

280
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,595
- It was, it was an adventure,

281
00:10:06,595 --> 00:10:07,459
it was really cool.

282
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:10,405
And that's just part, one small part

283
00:10:10,405 --> 00:10:13,038
of the whole process of this cookbook.

284
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:14,878
- It's exciting, we're learning a lot.

285
00:10:14,878 --> 00:10:16,795
A huge credit to Jared.

286
00:10:17,975 --> 00:10:19,982
We've only done a few sessions

287
00:10:19,982 --> 00:10:22,682
for the cookbook and it's
usually not been with kids,

288
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,821
because they don't need to be there

289
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:26,483
and it's overwhelming.

290
00:10:26,483 --> 00:10:27,962
But today we did, because we wanted

291
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,044
to do a few photos with the kids,

292
00:10:29,044 --> 00:10:30,443
we wanted to do a campfire,

293
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:31,486
and while we were in the middle

294
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:32,758
of our hectic craziness,

295
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,934
Jared was so cute.

296
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,829
He brought out his guitar,

297
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:37,000
he stayed with the kids,

298
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,173
he played games with them

299
00:10:38,173 --> 00:10:41,552
and it was really cute for
me to listen and hear him

300
00:10:41,552 --> 00:10:43,440
and I went out by the
fire for just a minute,

301
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,685
and I watched him and I wanted to film,

302
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,205
but I decided not to,

303
00:10:46,205 --> 00:10:48,782
but he was so cute, I love you.

304
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:50,117
- Well I think the funnest part

305
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,933
for everyone is I grabbed all of the kids,

306
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,237
all of the grandkids

307
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,357
and I put them all on the
trampoline and we had like a

308
00:10:56,357 --> 00:10:57,479
- Fight.
- Trampoline.

309
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:58,471
- Not a fight,

310
00:10:58,471 --> 00:10:59,304
- Oh.

311
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:00,137
- it was a contest,

312
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,640
a trampoline trick contest.

313
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,640
All of the kids lined up on the edge

314
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,356
of the trampoline and each one

315
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:08,570
went one at a time

316
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,249
and they all waited patiently.

317
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:12,395
And I was like this
announcer for this contest

318
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,414
and it was just so fun to see the kids

319
00:11:14,414 --> 00:11:16,276
listen and be patient

320
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,576
and go one at a time all together, so.

321
00:11:18,576 --> 00:11:19,430
- And do their cool trick.

322
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,263
- [Jared] Yeah.

323
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,890
- Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

324
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,723
- [Jared] Thank you for watching.

325
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,556
- Bye.

326
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,628
- Bye, you're upside down.

327
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,653
What are we gonna do upside down?

328
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:31,362
No (mumbling).

329
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:33,161
- Make the ugliest face you can make.

330
00:11:33,161 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughs)
