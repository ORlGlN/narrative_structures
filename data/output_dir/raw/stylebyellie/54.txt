1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,370
- I need to get out of the house

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,591
and breathe some cold, crisp air.

3
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:05,592
- Whoa.

4
00:00:05,592 --> 00:00:06,425
- Woo!

5
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:09,398
- Hold my bum!

6
00:00:09,398 --> 00:00:10,940
I am rushing to the hospital right now.

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,380
This is crazy.

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,690
The doctors are gonna
take good care of you,

9
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,523
okay buddy?

10
00:00:14,523 --> 00:00:16,720
Whoa it's a scary monster.

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,695
He's got claws. Oh no! Ah!

12
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:20,528
- Rar!

13
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,680
- I'm dead. You got me.

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,404
Good morning boys, how are you today?

15
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:26,237
- Good.

16
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:27,070
- Good.

17
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:27,903
Calvin, guess what.

18
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:29,520
It is first thing in the morning.

19
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,645
We gotta start potty training. Hello.

20
00:00:32,645 --> 00:00:35,120
Say it. Hello. Ah.

21
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:39,260
I said it's time to start potty training.

22
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,570
We gotta wake up bright and early

23
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,310
and get our potty training on.

24
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,330
Well at least someone is
excited that it snowed today.

25
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,520
I just let Penny out, it's in the morning,

26
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,620
she just got outside.

27
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,170
The first thing she did
when I let her outside.

28
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,120
She looked around, saw that it snowed,

29
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,810
and she started rolling
around in the snow.

30
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,170
And I was like oh geez.

31
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,770
I'm done with the snow.

32
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:02,470
But I still have fun plowing.

33
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,970
I plowed last night, the
drive way. It was cool.

34
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,350
But I am ready for some warm weather.

35
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,980
Thank you for your suggestions
on warm weather places

36
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,700
because we're serious.

37
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:16,040
We may pick up, grab the
trailer, and go somewhere warm.

38
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,457
- [Woman] Okay, choose one for milk.

39
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:21,260
(gasping)

40
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,140
No! It's a carrot.

41
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,230
K, mama's turn.

42
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,790
Green leaf. Huh!

43
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,830
Here, you go now.

44
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,683
Umbrella.

45
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:33,810
Choose an umbrella.

46
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,070
Oh, what color is this?

47
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,073
- Purple.

48
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:41,252
Yeah!

49
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,140
- We are watching PJ Masks in our PJs.

50
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,470
What is your kids favorite show?

51
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,030
PJ Masks is one of our, my kids,

52
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,050
shows that they really like.

53
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,300
We are working on potty training still

54
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,570
and we have cabin fever.

55
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:57,410
We have cabin fever.

56
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,990
I think the kids need
to get out of the house.

57
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,180
I need to get out of the
house and breathe some cold,

58
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,170
crisp air.

59
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,290
So we're just gonna play for the morning

60
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:07,570
and then I think we're
gonna take a little break

61
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,880
from potty training for a few hours.

62
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,120
And just get out of the house.

63
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,310
I do like winters, I
like being in the house.

64
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,990
I like doing puzzles with the kids.

65
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,050
I like our quiet days.

66
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,930
We have a lot of quiet days in the winter.

67
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:22,930
Just lounging around the house.

68
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,930
And I think just with the
stresses of potty training

69
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,610
we're all like itching to get out.

70
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,700
So it's gonna feel good to go outside.

71
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,990
I wanna know who picked
up the cookie and thought

72
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,320
they could eat it.

73
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,750
Who's teeth marks are those?

74
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:37,795
- Mine.

75
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,009
- Did you eat it one time?

76
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:42,100
Thinking it was a cookie?

77
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,650
We have moved our party upstairs.

78
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,720
Kids are over there playing with Play-Doh.

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,750
And tonight, last night Jared made dinner.

80
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,490
And for so long, I've
wanted to get a babysitter

81
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,960
and go to Salt Lake.

82
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,700
And just go like a really fancy restaurant

83
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,400
and dress up, like that just
sounds like a really fun day.

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,060
But we're not doing that right now.

85
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,180
So I'm going to make us
a really yummy dinner.

86
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,410
And very rarely do I make like,

87
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,340
a three course meal, like it's just like,

88
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,380
okay, it's roast potatoes and
here's a cookie for dessert

89
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,213
and that's dinner.

90
00:03:11,213 --> 00:03:13,340
Something that just like a
meal, and then that's it.

91
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,920
Like I don't make like a dessert

92
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,870
or like a salad or anything.

93
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,880
So, tonight I am going to do that.

94
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,280
I'm gonna make a salad,
I'm making a dessert,

95
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,310
I found a really super easy sorbet

96
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,390
and I just need to figure
out what kind of meal

97
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,223
I wanna make.

98
00:03:27,223 --> 00:03:28,800
It's probably gonna be
something I've never made before

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,450
because I want it to be
like really fancy. So.

100
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,850
Yeah I'm just on Pintrest right now,

101
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,820
just looking up a bunch of things.

102
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,190
I'm so proud of you.

103
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,330
- Thank mom.

104
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,180
- You're welcome.

105
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,390
Honey you did so good.

106
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,940
He's like, stop talking
and give me my juice now.

107
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,860
Here you go.

108
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,050
He was asking for more
juice and I was like,

109
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,430
oh he hasn't gone potty all morning.

110
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,410
I was like go potty and
I'll give you juice,

111
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,410
and he went potty.

112
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:57,200
Been a day and a half
of no accidents, guys.

113
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,960
And lately he's been
saying thanks mom a lot.

114
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,618
Like, I think he definitely
picks it up from Jackson.

115
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,580
And he says sorry.

116
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,030
Like today, little hot mess this morning,

117
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,570
and he goes sorry mom.

118
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,670
And I'm like, its fine.
But don't do that again.

119
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,970
Anyway, no accidents for
a day and a half so far.

120
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,880
I think things are setting in.

121
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,870
And I'm just so excited.

122
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,670
And I'm really excited
just to make dinner.

123
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,660
I'm already hungry and it's lunch.

124
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,230
Can we just skip the day and
just go straight to dinner?

125
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,575
Anyone?

126
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:27,555
- [Man] Hey bud. Do you
wanna go down the hill?

127
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:28,971
- No.

128
00:04:28,971 --> 00:04:31,315
- No. (laughing) yeah okay.

129
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:32,148
Woo!

130
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:39,307
Yeah Jackson!

131
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:43,933
- Hey guys we're going. Whee! I did it!

132
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,560
- All right mamma, it's our turn.

133
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,680
We gotta show the boys how to do sledding.

134
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,601
- Okay.

135
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:53,184
- You hop in front.

136
00:04:54,448 --> 00:04:56,510
- This sled is a fast one.

137
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,819
- Ready?

138
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:58,902
Set. Go! Woo!

139
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,007
(yelling)

140
00:05:08,202 --> 00:05:09,035
Yeah!

141
00:05:10,938 --> 00:05:13,957
- How many ugly faces did I just pull?

142
00:05:13,957 --> 00:05:16,354
Calvin. Will you go speed down the hill?

143
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,416
- Yeah.

144
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,370
- Yeah?

145
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,203
Woo!

146
00:05:26,428 --> 00:05:27,261
- Wee!

147
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,820
- Should I go down the slide you guys did?

148
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:35,275
I might be too big.

149
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,192
Here we go.

150
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,563
Woo!

151
00:05:42,736 --> 00:05:43,569
Go.

152
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,066
Sliding into your DMs like.

153
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,510
That didn't work.

154
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,420
I guess I'm not sliding into your DMs.

155
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,160
- Okay now hold me tight.

156
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,330
Are you my baby?

157
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,163
- Yeah.

158
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,443
- Did you hear that? Are you my baby?

159
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:03,342
- Yeah.

160
00:06:03,342 --> 00:06:04,472
- Yeah!

161
00:06:04,472 --> 00:06:05,822
Okay. We're gonna go first.

162
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:09,039
No one's been down this one.

163
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,224
Crystal clear.

164
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:12,229
(yelling)

165
00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:13,062
Woo!

166
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,230
- It feels good to be out here.

167
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,090
I'm so glad we're doing this.

168
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,820
Even Penny got a crazy workout.

169
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,460
There was another, a Labrador
retriever that is here.

170
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,510
And Penny was playing so
much with her friend, so.

171
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,050
This has been a good day for everybody.

172
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,700
- Oh my gosh, okay, I am rushing
to the hospital right now.

173
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,540
This is crazy.

174
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,610
I was getting the kids
ready in the bathtub

175
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,990
while Ellie was grocery
shopping for dinner tonight.

176
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,450
And we got a phone call
saying that we needed

177
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,240
to rush to the hospital because Cody

178
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,900
is going to the hospital right now.

179
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,270
Being rushed to the hospital
because he split his head open.

180
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,850
So we are running to
the hospital right now

181
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,310
to make sure everything's okay,

182
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,600
and to take care of Cody.

183
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,580
Oh geez.

184
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,160
You doing okay, bud?

185
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,440
You hanging in there?

186
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,170
You're tough, aren't ya?

187
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,456
Does it hurt right now?

188
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,289
- No.

189
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,016
- Good.

190
00:07:03,016 --> 00:07:04,630
Good, the doctors are gonna
take good care of you,

191
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,463
Okay buddy?

192
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,760
So looks like Cody will need stitches.

193
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,220
They were looking to see
if they could glue it,

194
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,210
but it's just open a little too much.

195
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,380
So they're gonna stitch it up,

196
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,660
and then we'll go home. K?

197
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,880
And maybe just to make
things feel even better,

198
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,380
we'll grab some like
ice cream or something.

199
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,800
Would you like that?

200
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,816
- Mhm.

201
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:21,817
- Okay good.

202
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,640
Cody you look like Michelangelo
from the Ninja Turtles.

203
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,328
Is he your favorite Ninja Turtle?

204
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:28,213
- Yeah I like the blue one but.

205
00:07:28,213 --> 00:07:29,212
- Leonardo?

206
00:07:29,212 --> 00:07:31,430
- Yeah. And the orange
one because he's silly.

207
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,760
- Yeah he's pretty funny, huh?

208
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,760
- Hey buddy!

209
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,761
- Hey!

210
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,760
Hey how's it going?

211
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
- Aw, is he okay?

212
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:41,519
- Yeah.

213
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,953
- Look at that big old smile on his face.

214
00:07:42,953 --> 00:07:43,955
Are you okay buddy?

215
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:44,953
- Yeah.

216
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:46,690
- I am so glad that Uncle Jared is taking

217
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,044
the best care of you.

218
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:50,180
- Mommy?

219
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:51,050
- Yeah?

220
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,600
- I was sledding at Bree's house

221
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,000
and I was going a little fast.

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,020
That I crashed into the deck.

223
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,200
- [Man] Okay, how do you feel?

224
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,485
- Good.

225
00:08:04,485 --> 00:08:05,390
- [Man] Yeah, was that bad or was it good?

226
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,223
- It was good.

227
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:08,660
- [Man] Yeah was it worse
or better than you thought?

228
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,840
- Better.

229
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,673
- [Man] Good, hey I'm glad to hear that.

230
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:11,820
You are so tough.

231
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,420
- Is that a giant shot?

232
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:16,400
- [Man] No. Wouldn't
that be kind of scary?

233
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,050
Now that's just to measure
oxygen and different things.

234
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:21,870
- What's that for?

235
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,570
- [Man] That is to hang things like an IV,

236
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,995
and saline solution, and
those kind of things.

237
00:08:27,995 --> 00:08:30,000
- What are ... is a IV thingy?

238
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,810
- [Man] That is where they,

239
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm not exactly sure
everything about an IV.

240
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,582
But we should look it up

241
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,789
and then we can find out the answer.

242
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,379
You did good, I'm proud of you, Bud.

243
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,440
You did awesome.

244
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,730
You're like a good example of what to do

245
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,080
when you gotta be tough.

246
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,570
- It's a little tight though.

247
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,440
- [Man] Yeah, it will feel a little tight.

248
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,570
It will feel a little sore.

249
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,040
But you'll be good.

250
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,050
Good job buddy.

251
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,370
Oh look, here we are.

252
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,320
Good job, Bud.

253
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,610
Well I guess all in all,

254
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,574
Cody is pretty happy and
he's doing pretty good.

255
00:09:03,574 --> 00:09:05,600
I was scared at first.

256
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,860
It's not always fun to
get a call like that.

257
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,580
But I'm glad I could be here,

258
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,750
and I'm glad you're doing great.

259
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,583
You doing good?

260
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:15,720
You're so into the game.

261
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,091
Come on, Cody.

262
00:09:17,091 --> 00:09:17,924
- Hi Cody.

263
00:09:20,256 --> 00:09:21,089
- Whoa.

264
00:09:22,793 --> 00:09:24,190
- Yep we stitched it.

265
00:09:25,236 --> 00:09:27,275
- [Man] He's so proud of himself.

266
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,653
- He's like I got something cool.

267
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:29,510
- [Man] Yeah.

268
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:31,420
You were so tough, huh?

269
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,116
What do you think, is that cool?

270
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:34,826
- Yeah I think that's so cool.

271
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,170
And guess what, it's his first time.

272
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,850
- Yeah, he was telling me,

273
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:40,170
he's like yeah, my sister got stitches,

274
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,199
my brother got stitches, my
other brother got stitches.

275
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,420
Yeah my mom and dad have stitches.

276
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,750
And now you finally joined the club.

277
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,118
K, you have a good night, buddy, okay?

278
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:53,951
- Thank you.

279
00:09:53,951 --> 00:09:55,060
- [Man] Thanks guys. We'll see ya.

280
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,160
- Well that was quite the change of plans.

281
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,120
- You just wanted to get out of dinner.

282
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,530
- Well I just didn't, I mean,

283
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,270
I kind of screwed it up yesterday,

284
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,310
so I figured this would be a good way.

285
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,368
Ellie this looks so cute.

286
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,201
- [Ellie] Thanks.

287
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,380
- This looks great.

288
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,120
Did you get those flowers today, too?

289
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,218
- Yes.

290
00:10:12,218 --> 00:10:13,168
- Aw.

291
00:10:13,168 --> 00:10:14,400
- So happy Valentine's Day to you,

292
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,020
now I don't have to cook.

293
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,550
- Hey, there's no pre-celebration here.

294
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,970
It's not even February.

295
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,040
- Um this is just fun
for me to do tonight.

296
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,300
- Yeah, this is great.

297
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,133
- It's been a fun day.

298
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:26,433
- Yeah.

299
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:27,266
- Minus Cody's incident.

300
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:28,410
- I know, I feel bad, but honestly,

301
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:32,060
like knowing that he's
A OK and he feels good.

302
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,670
He was so excited to show Boss and Olivia.

303
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,370
He stood there was like, I got stitches.

304
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,070
Yeah, like he really really was.

305
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,990
So it was scary at first,

306
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,727
but now everything's good.

307
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:45,310
(guitar music)

308
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,299
- The kids are in bed,
and I got Jared and I

309
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,420
a little treat.

310
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,400
So we can watch a movie.

311
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,940
So thank you guys so much for watching.

312
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,890
I hope you guys are
having an awesome weekend,

313
00:11:15,890 --> 00:00:00,000
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.
