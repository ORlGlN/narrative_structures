1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,300
- It looks like it's getting worse.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:04,573
- [Jared] Your mole?

3
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:06,570
- Do you think there's
a zit under my mole?

4
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,490
- [Jared] Is that possible?

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,055
- I don't even know.

6
00:00:09,055 --> 00:00:11,690
I just turned on the
camera and I was like,

7
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,965
my face looks worse than it did yesterday.

8
00:00:13,965 --> 00:00:15,220
(coughing)

9
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,200
We're so happy to have Jared home.

10
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,500
- Woo ooh!

11
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,480
Party when Dad is home.

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,650
Party when Dad is home,
party when Daddy's home.

13
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,483
Aww.

14
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,494
- [Ellie] Don't hit.

15
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,678
- I'm leaving.

16
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,000
- Jared is editing.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,040
I'm sitting here eating breakfast

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,410
and Mr. Calvin, of course,

19
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,834
follows me wherever I go.

20
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:40,667
- Ah!

21
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,500
- [Jared] Take a bite.

22
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,333
- Ah!

23
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:43,633
- [Jared] You want a bite?

24
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:45,938
(Jared mock gobbling)

25
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:46,780
(Laughs)

26
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,590
- So he can get his second breakfast.

27
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,310
You ate right when you woke up,

28
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,910
but mow you want more, huh?

29
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,710
- [Jared] Haven't you ever
heard of second breakfast Ellie?

30
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,290
- Oh yeah, hello I'm pregnant.

31
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,748
- [Jared] Don't show me, because
my offices is really dirty.

32
00:00:58,748 --> 00:00:59,767
- It's okay.

33
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,850
Hi Calverino.

34
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:04,571
(Jared laughing)

35
00:01:07,725 --> 00:01:08,620
(laughs)

36
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,780
Jackson just brought me this picture.

37
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,780
This is a picture of me at church

38
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,565
when I was going into
Sunbeams just like Jackson is.

39
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:18,133
You're my baby boy.

40
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,960
You are so cute.

41
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,250
Did you see that and wonder

42
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,246
why Mommy was so little?

43
00:01:23,246 --> 00:01:24,079
- Mmm-hmm.

44
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:26,140
- [Ellie] He's like Mom,
why were you so little?

45
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,150
- Why are you wearing these?

46
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,180
- [Ellie] Because I was a goofball

47
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,050
and wore my regular shoes.

48
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,670
- Why were you wearing these white things?

49
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,620
- Those were my tights to keep me warm.

50
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,890
That was my favorite
dress, I still have it.

51
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,020
I have it folded up.

52
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,310
I only have two childhood clothing items

53
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,290
and that's one of them.

54
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,890
Why are you being goofy?

55
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,120
Okay guys I know I just
talked about my skin,

56
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,302
but I feel like it's getting worse.

57
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:56,640
Look at this half of my
face looks pretty good,

58
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,830
this half of my face, look,

59
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,017
look at everything.

60
00:02:01,017 --> 00:02:02,308
(laughs)

61
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:04,850
Pregnancy does weird things to your body,

62
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,750
weird things to your hormones.

63
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,309
La la la oh that's my lipstick.

64
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,142
- La la la la la--

65
00:02:10,142 --> 00:02:11,670
- You keep finding stuff under there.

66
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,460
Pregnancy does some weird stuff to you

67
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,200
and I do have an appointment set up

68
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,490
for a dermatology appointment

69
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,820
to look at this specifically.

70
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,770
This is a zit, that's a bad zit,

71
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,810
but this, you can just see around it,

72
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,330
I haven't touched it,
but around it is weird.

73
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,620
This is not a zit, I don't
even know what that is.

74
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,810
I seriously just kind
of look like a hot mess

75
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,160
and I'm hoping everything is good,

76
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,100
but that's just crazy,

77
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,267
because Bonnie had the
cancer spot removed,

78
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,650
my Dad had a cancer spot removed.

79
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,667
I can't remember if Bonnie's
was cancerous or pre-cancerous.

80
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,440
Jared's dad had a cancerous spot removed.

81
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,850
So that's why I'm like,
that is just weird.

82
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,890
Thank you and the horse,

83
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,080
can you put it in your bucket?

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,190
Go put it away, thank you.

85
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,870
Prefect.

86
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,703
Good job.

87
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:05,380
I'm not getting ready
today, because Bonnie called

88
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,580
and she's like oh--

89
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,902
that's a marble, thank you.

90
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:09,735
(laughs)

91
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:11,800
He's finding stuff under the couch.

92
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,550
Bonnie's coming over today, she's like,

93
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,630
what are you guys doing today?

94
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,230
I was like, nothing we want to take Penny

95
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,200
up on a walk, up on the mountain,

96
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,160
just kinda hanging out

97
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,410
but not really any plans.

98
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,970
And she's like can we
come get in your hot tub,

99
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,150
she's like, my kids want
to get out of the house.

100
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,110
And I don't want Jackson to hear,

101
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,980
because I just want him to be surprised

102
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,900
when they come over.

103
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,733
But they're gonna come over,

104
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:30,566
we're gonna get a lunch,

105
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,510
we're gonna get in the hot tub,

106
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,530
we're gonna hang out

107
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,700
and it's gonna be a fun Saturday.

108
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,430
Jared is editing the vlog from,

109
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,016
is it two days ago Jared?

110
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:40,130
- Yes, CES day one.

111
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,130
- CES day one?

112
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,790
And in that vlog, you
can see that this spot

113
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,410
is just a freckle.

114
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,870
It's just a freckle.

115
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,040
And then in a matter of a day and a half,

116
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,140
it went from a freckle

117
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:54,570
to an inflamed mole, weird.

118
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,570
Okay, you guys are probably done

119
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,910
hearing me talk about this,

120
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,370
but it's just part of my life right now

121
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,550
and it's crazy.

122
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,637
Okay, let's get ready.

123
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:06,920
Let's get ready for our
cousins to come over, okay?

124
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,925
Hello.
- Ready to party.

125
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,027
- Hi Jackson, we brought our swim suits.

126
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,659
- Hi.
- Yay!

127
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,042
- We're here and we're
ready for the hot tub.

128
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:16,890
- [Jared] Bon, Happy Saturday.

129
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,723
- [Bonnie] Happy Saturday.

130
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:18,800
- [Ellie] I wasn't gonna tell Jackson

131
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,185
and Jared was like, Jackson was like,

132
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:21,533
can we get in the hot tub?

133
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:23,106
And Jared's like we gotta
wait for our cousins

134
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:24,500
I'm like, why did you say that?

135
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,650
- I had no idea.

136
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,083
I've been in my office all morning.

137
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,645
- [Ellie] Hi Link.

138
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:30,666
- [Jared] Ellie was like
look at your outfit.

139
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:31,580
(Bonnie laughs)

140
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,857
- [Olivia] Did you like your trip?

141
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:33,690
- I did, thank you so much for asking.

142
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,700
- Are you guys starving?

143
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,798
- Yes.
- Yes.

144
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:37,330
- So frigging hungry.
- I'm sorry.

145
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,739
- [Bonnie] There's no way that's a mole.

146
00:04:38,739 --> 00:04:40,150
- [Ellie] It is, look at it.

147
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,110
- Pardon me, but do you happen

148
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,689
to have any Grey Poupon?

149
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,205
(laughing)

150
00:04:45,205 --> 00:04:46,038
- [Child] What is this?

151
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,048
- Not poo poo, Poupon.

152
00:04:48,048 --> 00:04:49,510
Not even pupa, Poupon.

153
00:04:51,664 --> 00:04:52,747
- Oh my gosh.

154
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,450
- I really want to do a video

155
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,010
where we do dad jokes.

156
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,310
Where you fill your mouth with water,

157
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,520
and then we do dad jokes

158
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,940
and we try to see who can not laugh.

159
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,294
The try not to laugh challenge.

160
00:05:04,294 --> 00:05:05,480
- That would be so fun.

161
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,863
- [Jared] We should do that.

162
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:10,363
(funky atmospheric music)

163
00:06:05,549 --> 00:06:09,049
(funky atmospheric music)

164
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,400
Okay Penny, you've got a ball,

165
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,030
but you want this one more.

166
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:24,670
You ready for this?

167
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,820
You ready for this?

168
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,653
One

169
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,373
two

170
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:30,282
three!

171
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,740
(Jared laughs)

172
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,130
She's trying to get both in her mouth,

173
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,210
there we go, good girl.

174
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,242
Woo.

175
00:06:38,242 --> 00:06:39,630
- I want to throw something for her.

176
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,010
- [Jared] Okay, that's a great idea.

177
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,843
Here's her football.

178
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:43,160
Are you ready to throw it?

179
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,270
- Wait, this one's slobbery.

180
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,700
- [Jared] Oh it's wet from the snow.

181
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,533
Can you do it?

182
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:47,430
Okay throw it as hard as you can,

183
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,440
like a football.

184
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,959
Ready set go!

185
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,220
(Jared laughs)

186
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,070
Did you have so much fun

187
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,295
in the hot tub today with your cousins?

188
00:06:54,295 --> 00:06:55,128
- Uh-huh.

189
00:06:55,128 --> 00:06:56,370
- [Jared] Yeah, okay I got this ball,

190
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,569
you can throw this one, you
want to throw it from there?

191
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,402
- Yep.

192
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,380
- [Jared] Okay.

193
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,592
Go!

194
00:07:01,592 --> 00:07:02,925
- One two three!

195
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:05,910
- Woo, good throw bud.

196
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,230
Okay watch this bud.

197
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,690
I'm gonna do something so amazing,

198
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,150
so incredible, you will
not even believe your eyes.

199
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:13,983
Okay?

200
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:14,816
- Okay.

201
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:16,147
- [Jared] Okay, you ready?

202
00:07:16,147 --> 00:07:16,980
- [Jackson] Yeah.

203
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,813
- [Jared] Here we go Penny.

204
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:19,282
Here we go.

205
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:20,115
Boom!

206
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,146
- [Jackson] How did you do that?

207
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:24,313
- I'm magical.

208
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,469
- [Jackson] You're not magical.

209
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,797
- You're right.

210
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:29,850
- [Jackson] You're not too magical.

211
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,100
- You are too strong
for your own good Penny.

212
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:34,993
(yells)

213
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,748
(grunts)

214
00:07:40,748 --> 00:07:42,310
Whoa (laughs) woo.

215
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,169
(bright music)

216
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,252
Ready set go.

217
00:07:58,813 --> 00:07:59,646
- Wow.

218
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,870
- You are running me out of energy.

219
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,190
You just have so much energy,

220
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,960
I can't even keep up,

221
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,550
but maybe I'll be able to.

222
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,628
Sneak attack!

223
00:08:09,628 --> 00:08:12,690
No she's too quick, she's too quick,

224
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:13,630
I can't keep up.

225
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:15,335
- I'm helping him do this.

226
00:08:15,335 --> 00:08:16,968
- You're so fast.
- Ah ah ah!

227
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:20,940
(Jared laughs)
(Jackson grunting)

228
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,850
Whoa ooh!

229
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,400
Is that eight seconds,
ladies and gentlemen?

230
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,680
Did he get it at eight
seconds on the clock?

231
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,370
We will find out if he is the winner

232
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:29,040
of the championship tonight.

233
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:32,664
(Jared laughs)

234
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,870
Were you getting on
Penny like a bull rider?

235
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,481
Or something like that?

236
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,308
- But she's not letting me have it.

237
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:39,999
- [Jared] Do you want me to get it for ya?

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,832
- Yes.

239
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,109
- Okay, I'll do my best, but she's tough.

240
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,059
Okay, she's tough.

241
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,920
It's Saturday and that
means it's date night.

242
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,560
We're going to see The Greatest Showman.

243
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
I just got off the phone with Dan Markham

244
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,640
from What's Inside not too long ago.

245
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,160
And he's seeing it for
the second time today

246
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,510
and he said it was amazing.

247
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,900
- In one day?

248
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,860
- No I just think second time overall,

249
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,140
but he was--
- I got lots of snacks.

250
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,973
- Yeah we got snacks

251
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,420
proving we haven't had dinner yet.

252
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,600
But he was saying that so
many people in the theater

253
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,520
were seeing it like the third, fourth time

254
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,600
since it's came out.

255
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,390
So even better than Star
Wars and everything.

256
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,724
Hi how are you?

257
00:09:11,724 --> 00:09:13,126
- [Ellie] I've seen you before.

258
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:14,340
- [Jared] Do you have our tickets?

259
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,336
- Did you go to the bathroom?

260
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:16,169
- Yeah.

261
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:17,830
So I'm really excited to see this movie.

262
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,510
We've got all the goodies

263
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,480
and Bonnie and Joel are grabbing theirs.

264
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,313
We're going in the theater

265
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:24,710
because it's packed, it is jam packed.

266
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,440
♪ Whoa ♪
(dramatic music)

267
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,780
♪ Ladies and gents, this is
the moment you've waited for. ♪

268
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,490
- Holy freakin' crap.

269
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,300
- I've never gone to a movie twice,

270
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,230
but that would be worth to go again.

271
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,920
- The Greatest Showman
was so incredibly good.

272
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,242
Joel, where did you park?

273
00:09:41,242 --> 00:09:42,075
(laughing)

274
00:09:42,075 --> 00:09:44,370
Hey, you guys are just
copying what we did.

275
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,203
- What?

276
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:49,176
- Seriously, so--
- Where's your car?

277
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,910
- Dan said this is the
second or third time

278
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,010
he's seen this movie.

279
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,900
And I was like, man that--

280
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,990
- It must be really good.
- He must really like it.

281
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,390
- And holy crap.

282
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,640
- I can see why.

283
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,160
- I can totally see why.

284
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,710
And this is one of those movies

285
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,820
I said the last time when
we saw was like Star Wars,

286
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,747
or something like, ooh
careful guys, jeepers.

287
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:08,067
(laughing)

288
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:09,000
- Who claps at the movie?

289
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,910
- Yeah, there was applause
at the end of this movie,

290
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,150
but I always want to be
in these superhero movies,

291
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,710
and be the superhero,

292
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,826
but it's like, no I
want to join the circus!

293
00:10:21,826 --> 00:10:23,119
I want to join the circus!

294
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:23,952
- You can be the bearded lady.

295
00:10:23,952 --> 00:10:26,800
- Yeah, wait, it was so good.
- It was amazing.

296
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,700
- [Jared] So good.

297
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:29,780
- I liked the applause.

298
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,560
- Yeah, I'm hyped up.

299
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,510
- What was the quote at
the end of the movie?

300
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,920
- The noblest art is that
of making others happy.

301
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,770
- [Ellie] I love that.

302
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,550
- I love that and I hope
we do that too sometimes.

303
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,610
Let's make out in the back.

304
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,572
Thanks for watching guys.
(laughing)

305
00:10:43,572 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a wonderful day,
thanks guys, okay bye.
