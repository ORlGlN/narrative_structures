1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,540
- Hey buddy, I like your
hat, way to be cool.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:04,246
- Yeah, see that's awesome.

3
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:05,079
(laughs)

4
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:07,610
Ellie got a phone call
from the dermatologist

5
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:09,430
and it's not exactly
what we wanted to hear.

6
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:10,520
- If you guys feel like you need

7
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,020
to get something checked out,

8
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,380
don't ever be nervous,
go get it checked out.

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,453
- The heck?

10
00:00:17,453 --> 00:00:18,917
- The heck?

11
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,880
♪ I believe I can fly ♪

12
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,140
Oh my goodness gracious,
would you look at that,

13
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,190
it's a Mickey pancake kinda day.

14
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,030
Oh boy, oh boy.

15
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,610
- Every day is a Mickey
pancake kind of day.

16
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,850
- [Jared] Yeah.

17
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:32,683
Good morning guys.

18
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:34,400
How's everyone doing today?

19
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,583
- So good.

20
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:36,451
- [Jared] Good.

21
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,800
- Did you guys all sleep in?

22
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,860
Good job.
- Yeah they did.

23
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,300
- We're just getting breakfast going.

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,340
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

25
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,850
= Someone missed school.

26
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,490
- Oops, someone slept so much,

27
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,580
that they missed school

28
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,150
and some parents slept so much

29
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,410
that they missed school too.

30
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:51,831
And that's a rare
occasion in our household.

31
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,110
- And you know what?

32
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,470
That's okay.

33
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:55,760
I'm okay with that.
- That's okay.

34
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,750
(Jared laughs)

35
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,130
- We have lived in our
house for over a year,

36
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,700
almost a year and a half,

37
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,500
and I think we've tried
to do this three times

38
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,890
and have failed to finish.

39
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:08,250
We want blinds or shades

40
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,190
or rollers or whatever you
call them in our house.

41
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,380
And we've tried to do it three times,

42
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,990
we've had the measurements a bunch,

43
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,430
but we've never fulfilled it,

44
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,410
so I think today that is the goal,

45
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,160
is to get blinds and get
them ordered to be installed.

46
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,570
Are you coming with me bud?

47
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,432
Where are we going?

48
00:01:25,432 --> 00:01:26,265
- To Lowe's.

49
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:28,200
- To Lowe's, one of our favorite stores.

50
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,321
And look Jackson look,
my hoodie and your hat,

51
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:33,350
they match.

52
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,672
- Hey buddy, I like
your hat, way to be cool

53
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:37,448
- Yeah, see that's awesome.

54
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:38,281
(laughing)

55
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:41,560
Hey bud, I love to see you smile.

56
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
Smiling is--

57
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,996
seeing you smile makes my heart happy,

58
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,228
you know that bud?

59
00:01:46,228 --> 00:01:47,728
- Do you have this, the thing?

60
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,060
- Yeah, I've got it right
here, pretty cool, huh?

61
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,030
I guess I should be more specific.

62
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,770
We have blinds in our basement,

63
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,360
but we don't have blinds upstairs

64
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,930
by the kitchen and in the living room

65
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,450
and that's where we really want it.

66
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,560
So we are getting blinds for those areas.

67
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,720
- Look at those blinds.

68
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,580
- Wow, yeah these are cool,

69
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,250
but they're not what we're looking for.

70
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,580
These ones look really nice

71
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,690
but yeah, nothing like this.

72
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,910
Yeah, see I don't like the honeycomb.

73
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,800
Ooh wow, that's different

74
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,400
and matches up to the other one.

75
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,200
I think we want rollers,

76
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,250
so they're the most hidden.

77
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,160
And maybe in a perfect world,

78
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,060
boop, hit a button, zzsssooop,
- Oh, there's a roller.

79
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,070
that's kind of what we're looking for.

80
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,310
- Roller.

81
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:32,400
- [Jared] Oh yeah, those
are the window rollers.

82
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,629
These ones are kinda fun,
huh, because there's a stick.

83
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:37,095
Wamp.

84
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:38,600
Wamp.

85
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,120
Hey, I've got some good news

86
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,320
and I've got some bad news.

87
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,120
Which one do you want to hear first?

88
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:45,449
- The good news.

89
00:02:45,449 --> 00:02:46,380
- The good news?

90
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,570
The good news is we're not leaving yet,

91
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,000
the bad news is they don't have

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,681
what we're looking for.

93
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:52,514
- Oh.

94
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:53,540
- We gotta look for a
couple other things though.

95
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,730
We got our Folex, which
is the best carpet cleaner

96
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,780
that we've ever had, we
really really like it.

97
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,570
And what else?

98
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,590
What's this?

99
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,630
- Ice cleaner.

100
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:05,490
- Yeah, Ice Melt, so we
can put it on our driveway,

101
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,990
because we still have
some ice in our driveway,

102
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,180
because it is cold in Utah, huh?

103
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,220
- Mmm-hmm.

104
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,860
- Well I came into Lowe's thinking

105
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,880
that we were gonna come
out with some samples

106
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,490
or some orders for our blinds,

107
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,870
but today is not the day.

108
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,120
They didn't have anything,

109
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,810
and so I'm kinda disappointed.

110
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,100
But also at the same time I am going home

111
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,010
right away, because Ellie got a phone call

112
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,050
from the dermatologist

113
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,123
and it's not exactly
what we wanted to hear,

114
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:34,300
so I will let Ellie explain the phone call

115
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,133
to you guys.

116
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:37,170
- [Ellie] Calvin doesn't
even know what's going on.

117
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,820
Cal, do you think this will help?

118
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:42,826
- The heck?

119
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,663
- Bathroom.

120
00:03:44,663 --> 00:03:45,831
- [Jared] What is it?

121
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:47,702
- Potty.
- What is that?

122
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:48,535
- That's Mickey.

123
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:49,759
- Mickey and the Roadster
- Mickey--

124
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,103
- And the Roadster Racers.
- That's right.

125
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:53,520
- This is a toilet.

126
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,018
It's a potty for you Calvin.

127
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,270
- Let's open it up.

128
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,350
- [Ellie] Do you think
you'll sit on it Calvin?

129
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,313
- You wanna sit on this one?

130
00:04:00,313 --> 00:04:01,317
- No.

131
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:02,590
(laughing)

132
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,423
- We'll see.

133
00:04:03,423 --> 00:04:05,680
I am one to try anything and everything

134
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,210
if this is gonna make Calvin excited

135
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:10,040
and want to sit on the potty

136
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,070
even more than he already does, so be it.

137
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,940
We're gonna try it.

138
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,360
My neighbor came over last night

139
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,209
and she's like yeah I used
that all the time with my kids

140
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,639
and they really liked it.

141
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,899
And I thought, it's not gonna hurt,

142
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,732
we're gonna try it.

143
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,014
- [Jared] Do you want to sit on it?

144
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:23,240
- Yeah.

145
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,657
- Okay sit on it.

146
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:28,045
- Okay Jackson, show
him how you sit on it.

147
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,481
- [Ellie] Can you sit on it?

148
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:30,840
- You sit on it like this.

149
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,370
- Yeah.
- Perfect.

150
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,081
- [Ellie] Can you try it Cal?

151
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:34,914
- Yeah.

152
00:04:34,914 --> 00:04:35,747
- And I'll push the button.

153
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:36,580
- [Jared] Now push the button.

154
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,850
- Calvin just got done
using the big boy potty,

155
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,990
but I'm pretty sure he was
holding it all morning.

156
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,670
And he finally went today,
I'm really proud of him.

157
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,200
So I'm anxious to see
if this helps at all.

158
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,033
- Okay Jack--

159
00:04:49,033 --> 00:04:49,900
Calvin, now push the button.

160
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,400
Sit on it and push the button.

161
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,750
Push it down.

162
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,340
Yeah.

163
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,790
- The last few days we've been working

164
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,320
on potty training

165
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,210
and Calvin has been pretty good to go.

166
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,500
And then the last few days,

167
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,240
he's been getting upset
and he doesn't want

168
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,960
to sit on the potty

169
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,730
and so I've been giving him marshmallows

170
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,802
for sitting on the potty.

171
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:11,490
He'll sit for 10 seconds,

172
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,620
I'll be like you can have
a little baby marshmallow

173
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,140
and that's made him more excited.

174
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,270
And then when my neighbor told me,

175
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,580
she's like you should just get one,

176
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,370
just let him sit on that,
he'll think it's fun.

177
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,426
And maybe this will
continue our potty training

178
00:05:24,426 --> 00:05:27,600
and make it a little
more exciting for him,

179
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,780
because he just keep sitting on it

180
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,350
and he was trying to go,

181
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,060
versus when I put him on the big potty,

182
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,140
he is like, okay I'm done, I'm done.

183
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,820
So maybe this will keep it going.

184
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,730
I will say I sanitized the
bathrooms the other day

185
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,210
and our whole house is going to really

186
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,370
need a good cleaning when we're all

187
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,036
said and done with this week.

188
00:05:45,036 --> 00:05:48,286
(bright soulful music)

189
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,170
It is 5:30 and Calvin has
not had an accident today.

190
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,320
And I am so excited that we got this.

191
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,190
It actually has been really helpful.

192
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,620
He's kinda had it close to him.

193
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,620
He's loved carrying it around

194
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,990
and I came and looked at it,

195
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,240
and there was pee in it.

196
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,160
He went and pee by himself
and I didn't even know it.

197
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,220
Calvin.

198
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,210
He's been so cute, but I'm so proud of him

199
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,240
and I'm hoping that continuing
the next three days,

200
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,210
that'll be exactly a
week since we started,

201
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:24,410
it'll really set in, and
he'll do even better.

202
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,570
That's my hopes.

203
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:29,030
But I got a call from
the dermatologist today

204
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,040
and I told you guys that when Jared and I

205
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,910
went in a way I felt a little silly,

206
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,480
like I'm young, why am I
making this appointment

207
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,060
to get my whole body checked
out from head to toe?

208
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,740
But I just felt like I really should go

209
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,810
and I felt like Jared really should go.

210
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,040
And the doctor had taken one mole

211
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,070
off my back, but there was this other spot

212
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:49,100
that he saw, and he's like,
ooh that doesn't look good.

213
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,740
He goes we need to get rid of that one.

214
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,670
So he got rid of that one

215
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,530
and they just called
today with the results

216
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,560
and she said that it was an atypical mole,

217
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,640
and she said there's many scales of moles

218
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,190
or those type of moles and she said mine

219
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,550
leaned a lot more
towards the melanoma side

220
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:09,060
or maybe that was the stage
it was at or I don't know.

221
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,920
And it was really hard hearing it all,

222
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,770
but she said that I needed to go back in

223
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,110
and they needed to take more out

224
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,530
and make sure they got it all

225
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,920
and then I need to do a follow-up.

226
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,870
So it was a big deal

227
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,160
and I'm really glad that I just felt

228
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,110
that I should go and that
we went and got checked out,

229
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,066
because it's like what would happen if--

230
00:07:31,066 --> 00:07:35,350
I'm young, what if I just didn't
make an appointment and go

231
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,994
and five years go by.

232
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:40,620
What would be the progress
of that, you know?

233
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,270
It's just kind of nerve wracking

234
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,230
and it was a little scary to hear,

235
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,680
but I also feel really good

236
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,060
because I know nothing's gonna come of it

237
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,010
and we've gotten it taken car of

238
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,750
and we're gonna keep an eye on it, so.

239
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,730
I feel good about that,

240
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,854
but just in the back of my
mind, I'm like, that's scary.

241
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:56,860
(laughs)

242
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,010
So if you guys feel like you need

243
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,530
to get something checked out,

244
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,290
don't ever be nervous.

245
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,540
Go get it checked out, please,

246
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,460
'cause you just never know,

247
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,750
you just never know, so I'm
just really glad that we went.

248
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,650
Look at my belly.

249
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:11,451
- [Jackson] What?

250
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,160
- [Ellie] I'm 18 weeks.

251
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,510
I'm gonna do an update soon

252
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,510
and a haul video.

253
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,230
Look at that belly.

254
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,990
It's growing big, huh mister?

255
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:22,332
Blub blub blub.

256
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:25,415
(bright jazzy music)

257
00:08:41,494 --> 00:08:42,710
- Tonight I am making dinner

258
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,440
and as you can see, we have some veggies

259
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,370
on the tray, ready to rock and roll.

260
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,890
Potatoes, green beans, carrots

261
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,930
with a little salt and pepper and oil.

262
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,610
They're going to be cooking in the oven.

263
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,727
While they're cooking in the oven,

264
00:08:53,727 --> 00:08:55,542
I have two steaks in here

265
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:58,540
that I was going to be pan-seared.

266
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,620
Once we have a good color on the sear,

267
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,160
a nice texture, we're
gonna put them in the oven

268
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,190
and they will finish
off with the vegetables,

269
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,907
and hopefully come off at
the same time, nice and hot.

270
00:09:09,907 --> 00:09:12,990
(bright jazzy music)

271
00:09:14,773 --> 00:09:15,606
(sizzling)

272
00:09:15,606 --> 00:09:18,730
Oh baby, watch it sizzle, make it curl.

273
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,040
I wish you could smell this,

274
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,690
because it smells so stinkin' good.

275
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,770
I hope this turns out.

276
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,420
Every time I cook, like I
mentioned the other day,

277
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,760
I ruin everything, so
whether it's putting--

278
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,020
what did I just ruin?

279
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,500
A hot pan on the counter
top, I don't know.

280
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,730
I hope it turns out okay.

281
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,399
I feel like I've done this enough,

282
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,200
the pan-sear into the oven.

283
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,330
I feel like I've done it enough

284
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,610
that it's gonna be pretty good.

285
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,740
Just gotta keep an eye on it,

286
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,390
but it smells so stinkin' good.

287
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,550
I wish you could smell it.

288
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,530
I know you can smell it.

289
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,650
You're dying for it, huh?

290
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,615
Maybe we'll save a couple
pieces for ya, sister girl, huh?

291
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:53,471
Yeah?

292
00:09:53,471 --> 00:09:54,530
That's a good girl.

293
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,820
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

294
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,060
may I introduce to you tonight's dinner.

295
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,410
Save your applause until after the meal.

296
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:02,560
And Batman, do you approve Batman?

297
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,470
What are your thoughts
- He likes it.

298
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,530
- and opinions?

299
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,580
It looks pretty good

300
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,640
and that's why I like the pan-sear

301
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,470
is because it looks good.

302
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,150
It has a nice crisp outer edge

303
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,867
and a nice soft tender inside.

304
00:10:14,867 --> 00:10:16,920
It is one of the harder ways

305
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,050
to mess up a steak, and for me,

306
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,190
that's what I need.

307
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,261
So go ahead and take the first bite

308
00:10:23,261 --> 00:10:24,360
- Thank you Jared.

309
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,839
- [Jared] Oh you're so welcome my love.

310
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:26,940
- Penny you're being a good girl.

311
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,650
- [Jared] She's like if
I sit here good enough,

312
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,960
I can have a piece too.

313
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,020
- She knows I'll do it, if you're good.

314
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,640
- [Jared] (whispers)
Please please yes please.

315
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,983
- It's good.

316
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:37,221
♪ I believe I can fly ♪

317
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:38,550
- What kind of steak is it?

318
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,560
- It's just a sirloin,

319
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,227
nothing crazy incredible.

320
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:43,060
- So yeah I like sirloin.

321
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,952
The ribeyes I don't really like.

322
00:10:43,952 --> 00:10:45,160
- Not a lot of fat, yeah exactly.

323
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,130
Ellie doesn't like the
marbling all that much,

324
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,900
which is where your flavor is,
- Because it's gross.

325
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,010
- but it's a good in
between steak, I think,

326
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,180
sirloin's pretty good, okay.

327
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,013
Alright time to eat dinner,

328
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:57,080
I want to taste this myself.

329
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,600
- [Ellie] She is laying
her face on my leg.

330
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,177
That's so funny.

331
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:04,490
- [Jared] I don't know if
that's because of the donuts

332
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,490
or because of the food we're eating?

333
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:08,060
- [Ellie] She wants me to give her food.

334
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,750
- Gosh, I laugh at myself,
I'm annoyed with myself,

335
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,070
so here's the sitch.

336
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,900
I literally just said I
like the seared steaks

337
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,370
because they are harder to mess up,

338
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,914
it's harder to overcook them,

339
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:24,630
but sure enough, I overcooked 'em.

340
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,290
They're not terrible, they're good.

341
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,100
They're really good to eat,
but it's just overcooked

342
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,933
than I wanted it to be.

343
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:34,900
It's more of a medium well than a medium

344
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,484
and I like them to be
medium and so does Ellie.

345
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:40,350
Maybe more medium well well,

346
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:41,550
but definitely not well done.

347
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,940
That's why you keep cooking.

348
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,030
You keep cooking,

349
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,710
so you learn to cook better.

350
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,570
Ever since Ellie gave me the phone call

351
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,280
that the lab results came in
from our cancer screening,

352
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,230
it's just made me think
about how grateful I am

353
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,000
that we were able to get
this done when we did

354
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
and how things can change going forward.

355
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,580
It's crazy how just something so small

356
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,530
can make a difference like that.

357
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,440
It's on Ellie's side of the family,

358
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Bonnie, her dad and now Ellie

359
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
have to be careful about these things.

360
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,780
My dad had it,

361
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,410
and so I'm just grateful that we were able

362
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,516
to catch things early

363
00:12:15,516 --> 00:12:18,870
and we'll have to see how these tests go,

364
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,890
but all in all, like Ellie said earlier,

365
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,070
don't be afraid to get things checked,

366
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,370
because it's not gonna hurt.

367
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,753
Knowledge is important and powerful.

368
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:30,350
So with that, I hope you
have a wonderful day.

369
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,270
Thank you for watching the video today.

370
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,950
If you enjoyed it, give it a thumbs up

371
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,620
and as always, we will
see you guys tomorrow.

372
00:12:36,620 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
