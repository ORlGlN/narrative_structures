1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,262
- Are you ready?

2
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,095
- Yeah.

3
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:04,290
- Are you okay to do this video with me?

4
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:05,123
Okay.

5
00:00:05,123 --> 00:00:07,186
So it has been a year

6
00:00:07,186 --> 00:00:10,577
since I have saved
little notes in my phone

7
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,273
of what you had said.
- Ugly?

8
00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:14,396
- Jackson had said some really sweet

9
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:17,580
funny, tender things over this last year.

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,658
And several of those
things I've tweeted out,

11
00:00:19,658 --> 00:00:22,416
but most of them I've
just saved in my phone.

12
00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:23,249
Come here, hon.

13
00:00:23,249 --> 00:00:25,175
You just up and left our video.

14
00:00:25,175 --> 00:00:26,008
(laughs)

15
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:27,047
Our friends wondered where you went.

16
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:29,392
So I have saved these cute little moments

17
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:30,889
and I don't know how I want to do it.

18
00:00:30,889 --> 00:00:32,855
I'll kind of tell you the situation

19
00:00:32,855 --> 00:00:36,046
and then I'll retell Jacks what he said,

20
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:37,458
for him to repeat to tell you guys,

21
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:39,626
because he obviously doesn't remember

22
00:00:39,626 --> 00:00:40,991
all the things he said.

23
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:44,442
The first thing he said
- Butt crack.

24
00:00:44,442 --> 00:00:46,008
- Butt crack?

25
00:00:46,008 --> 00:00:48,065
(laughs)

26
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:51,106
- The things almost four year olds say.

27
00:00:51,106 --> 00:00:54,218
So one time, there was
a noise in the bathroom

28
00:00:54,218 --> 00:00:57,451
and you ran to the bathroom and you said,

29
00:00:57,451 --> 00:00:59,506
- Is that my baby Calvin?

30
00:00:59,506 --> 00:01:00,405
- He did say it.

31
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,443
He said is that my baby Calvin?

32
00:01:02,443 --> 00:01:03,856
And I thought it was so cute,

33
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:05,512
when we first moved into the house,

34
00:01:05,512 --> 00:01:07,215
Calvin was still little,

35
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:08,288
he would cry quite a bit

36
00:01:08,288 --> 00:01:11,515
and Jackson would always
say, is that my baby?

37
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:12,795
It was so tender and cute.

38
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:14,937
One time Penny was outside barking

39
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:15,894
at like a neighbor cat,

40
00:01:15,894 --> 00:01:18,413
and Jackson came running
to the door saying,

41
00:01:18,413 --> 00:01:21,524
- I'm coming Pen, it's okay, I'm here.

42
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:24,759
- Yeah, he said Pen I'm coming, I'm here.

43
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,457
And you were gonna be there for Pen, huh?

44
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:28,793
- Yeah.

45
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,460
Oh yeah, web psssht!

46
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,172
Probably I love you.

47
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,996
- He says that a lot,
probably I love you Mom.

48
00:01:35,996 --> 00:01:37,852
This is one time Jackson was leaving

49
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:41,005
to get in the car to go
over to Uncle Joel's house

50
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:43,619
and Jackson, you said,

51
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,036
- Penny, I'm going to Uncle Joel's house.

52
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:49,857
Be happy?

53
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,998
- He said, Penny I'm going
to Uncle Joel's house.

54
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:52,831
You happy?

55
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,182
You were sad to leave Penny.

56
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,054
- Yeah.

57
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:58,161
- Are you sad sometimes
if we have to leave Penny?

58
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:58,994
- Yeah.

59
00:01:58,994 --> 00:01:59,827
- Yeah.

60
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:01,599
This was when we very first got Penny.

61
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,031
She was laying down and
Jackson was just observing her

62
00:02:05,031 --> 00:02:07,623
and kinda poking her,
and kind of petting her

63
00:02:07,623 --> 00:02:11,186
and you looked at her and you said,

64
00:02:11,186 --> 00:02:15,467
- Oh Penny, you have an
awful lot of eyebrows dude.

65
00:02:15,467 --> 00:02:17,939
(laughing)

66
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:20,401
Who would want two ears?

67
00:02:20,401 --> 00:02:23,115
- Jackson expresses his love quite a bit.

68
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:25,214
And one time Jackson, you said,

69
00:02:25,214 --> 00:02:28,795
- I love Daddy, probably Penny and Calvin.

70
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:31,497
- Yeah you were telling me
how much you loved Daddy.

71
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:34,269
And mmm, you don't want to
forget about Penny and Calvin.

72
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:35,839
Oh this was hilarious.

73
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:36,672
This was hilarious.

74
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,725
I love that I wrote this down,

75
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,515
because I almost forgot this.

76
00:02:39,515 --> 00:02:42,124
We had just gotten done
hanging out with Aspen

77
00:02:42,124 --> 00:02:45,460
and Jackson asked, who's my husband,

78
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,449
Aunt Bonnie or Aspen?

79
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:49,116
And I died laughing.

80
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,736
- Who's my husband, Bonnie or Aspen?

81
00:02:53,736 --> 00:02:54,837
(laughs)

82
00:02:54,837 --> 00:02:56,253
- I kind of want him
to repeat what he said

83
00:02:56,253 --> 00:03:00,164
so you can hear it from
a four year old's mouth.

84
00:03:00,164 --> 00:03:02,576
One time we left Aunt Bonnie's house

85
00:03:02,576 --> 00:03:04,042
and it was a little stressful,

86
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,754
the kids weren't listening very well

87
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:09,593
and I was trying to
talk to Jackson about it

88
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:11,802
and I said Jackson, what did you do

89
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:13,533
to Aunt Bonnie's basement?

90
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:15,000
And he looked at me and said,

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,083
- I made a mess in Bonnie's basement.

92
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:22,121
- So sometimes
- Butt crack.

93
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,112
- when I go to the store,
the kids are really good

94
00:03:24,112 --> 00:03:25,425
and sometimes when I go to the store,

95
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,272
the kids are not very happy.

96
00:03:27,272 --> 00:03:29,255
So I went to Kohl's one time

97
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:30,212
and I was walking around

98
00:03:30,212 --> 00:03:32,556
and in the middle of walking around,

99
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:35,547
Jackson yells, as loud as he can,

100
00:03:35,547 --> 00:03:38,548
- I don't want want to look at Mom things!

101
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:41,696
- He said, I don't want
to look at Mom things!

102
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,866
And everyone looked at me

103
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,553
and we all laughed,

104
00:03:45,553 --> 00:03:47,888
because it was coming
from a three year old

105
00:03:47,888 --> 00:03:49,944
and it was hilarious.

106
00:03:49,944 --> 00:03:52,001
So sometimes I ask Jackson,

107
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,587
what's your favorite thing about Dad,

108
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:55,411
what's your favorite thing about Grandma

109
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:57,020
and I ask him what he thinks

110
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,066
about other people.

111
00:03:58,066 --> 00:03:59,479
And one time I said Jackson,

112
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,733
what's your favorite thing about Dad?

113
00:04:01,733 --> 00:04:04,361
And your response was,

114
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,769
- His chin!

115
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:07,216
- His chin.

116
00:04:07,216 --> 00:04:09,329
You like Dad's chin?

117
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:10,889
That was kinda funny.

118
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,849
Jackson was in gymnastic class for a year

119
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:15,624
and he ran up to his teacher

120
00:04:15,624 --> 00:04:18,671
yelling one time, and he said,

121
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,896
- Teacher my hero is Spiderman.

122
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,091
- Your hero is Spiderman.

123
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,339
Is he still your hero?

124
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,773
- Yeah, he's my favorite guy ever.

125
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:30,091
I need to go get my mask

126
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,903
and come right down to film.

127
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:35,185
- Let's get your mask when we're all done

128
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,890
and we'll say goodbye with your mask.

129
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,530
One time I was getting ready

130
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,122
and this is probably something

131
00:04:40,122 --> 00:04:40,955
- Mommy, give me your hand.

132
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:42,381
- This is a story I'll just tell you guys.

133
00:04:42,381 --> 00:04:45,821
One time, this is the
sweetest innocence of kids,

134
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,515
I was getting dressed

135
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:50,124
and Jackson walked in and he goes,

136
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,605
Mom, is that a freckle?

137
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:55,853
And I said, nope, that's not a freckle,

138
00:04:55,853 --> 00:04:56,973
that is a nipple.

139
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:58,956
And that is when we talked about

140
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:00,292
a few private parts.

141
00:05:00,292 --> 00:05:01,469
And that is when Jackson learned

142
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,354
about what nipples were.

143
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:04,664
One time I was expressing to Jackson

144
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:05,944
how much I loved him

145
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:09,833
and I said, Jackson what
would I do without you?

146
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,704
And his response was,

147
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:13,089
- Vacuum.

148
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:15,526
- You think I would vacuum without you?

149
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:16,359
- Yeah.

150
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,409
- 'Cause you see me vacuum a lot.

151
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,793
- Uh-huh.

152
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:22,905
- So do you remember when
we used to have no grass?

153
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:23,792
- Yeah.

154
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:25,207
- Well, when the snow melted,

155
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:27,937
I said, Jackson it's summer.

156
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:29,752
And he said,

157
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:32,929
- We get grass and a trailer.

158
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,340
- He had overheard Jared and I talking

159
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,907
so much about getting grass and a trailer

160
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:38,931
during the summer

161
00:05:38,931 --> 00:05:42,499
that he was so excited to
get grass and a trailer.

162
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:43,332
And I thought that was so cute

163
00:05:43,332 --> 00:05:45,411
that he'd yelled that.

164
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,051
That he was so excited.
(whining)

165
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,510
- I'm trying to button it up goof ball.

166
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,450
Can you feel it on your back?

167
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,283
- Yeah.

168
00:05:52,283 --> 00:05:53,116
- I'm trying to button it up.

169
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,188
Say thank you Mom.

170
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:55,124
- Thank you Mom.

171
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:56,316
- You're welcome.

172
00:05:56,316 --> 00:05:58,555
So this summer there was a lot of fires

173
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:01,435
in Utah, and especially in Montana,

174
00:06:01,435 --> 00:06:04,939
California, and the
one I was talking about

175
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,091
was in Montana.

176
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:08,363
I was talking to Jared about the fire

177
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:10,123
and how tragic it was

178
00:06:10,123 --> 00:06:13,290
and Jackson was very adamant, he said,

179
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:17,323
- We have to blow water and go there.

180
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,347
- He said Mom we have
to blow out with water

181
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:21,178
and go there now.

182
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:23,442
He overheard me talking about the fires

183
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,890
and he was like, let's
just blow it out with water

184
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,355
and let's go there.

185
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:29,939
And you were just ready
to help people, huh?

186
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:30,802
- Yeah.

187
00:06:30,802 --> 00:06:31,731
- Yeah.

188
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:34,698
So when I was expecting a baby

189
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:36,658
before I had a miscarriage,

190
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:38,825
Jackson asked me, he said,

191
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,866
- Is my baby gonna turn into Boss Baby?

192
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:46,334
- He said is my baby
gonna turn into Boss Baby?

193
00:06:46,334 --> 00:06:48,184
Because you had loved watching Boss Baby

194
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,760
and you were a little worried

195
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,592
that the baby would
come out like Boss Baby.

196
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:56,009
So Jackson's favorite
game is a motorcycle game.

197
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,209
He asks to play it quite a bit,

198
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,225
but we're almost done.

199
00:06:59,225 --> 00:07:01,381
Let's answer two more questions okay?

200
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,453
- Okay.

201
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:03,629
I'm ready.

202
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:06,606
- Okay, Jackson said and
this was just recently,

203
00:07:06,606 --> 00:07:08,230
he actually told Jared this.

204
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,244
I've been writing down
everything that I've heard.

205
00:07:10,244 --> 00:07:11,883
I haven't written down anything

206
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,928
that like he said to Jared.

207
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,326
So what did he say today?

208
00:07:15,326 --> 00:07:17,576
- Remember at our old house

209
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:22,701
Dad flushed Mom in the
toilet, down the toilet?

210
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,149
- Did you think that Dad
flushed me down the toilet?

211
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:25,982
- Yeah.

212
00:07:25,982 --> 00:07:27,349
- When did he do that?

213
00:07:27,349 --> 00:07:28,182
- I don't know.

214
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,205
- Well I don't know either.

215
00:07:29,205 --> 00:07:30,693
I was shocked when you said it.

216
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:33,273
He told Jared today, he was
like, remember at our old house

217
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:35,358
when you flushed Mom down the toilet?

218
00:07:35,358 --> 00:07:36,782
I was just like what?

219
00:07:36,782 --> 00:07:38,391
And last but not least,

220
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:41,014
this is a little clip I saved on my phone

221
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:43,149
to send to my family

222
00:07:43,149 --> 00:07:46,486
and Jackson was very
concerned about his bike

223
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:49,630
and it may include a swear word.

224
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,401
- Where is my
- What did you say?

225
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:54,620
- Where's my damn bike?

226
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,997
- [Ellie] I didn't hear you what?

227
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:58,632
- Where's my damn bike.

228
00:07:58,632 --> 00:07:59,535
- Oh.

229
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:02,106
And that is the video from Jackson and I

230
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:02,939
to you guys.

231
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,533
Those are some funny, cute,

232
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:07,374
bad things that he has said

233
00:08:07,374 --> 00:08:08,445
over the last year

234
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:10,331
that I thought were worth noting

235
00:08:10,331 --> 00:08:11,590
and writing down.

236
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,391
I've been wanting to do
this video for awhile

237
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:14,706
and now is the perfect timing,

238
00:08:14,706 --> 00:08:17,619
while Jared and I headed
out of the country.

239
00:08:17,619 --> 00:08:19,849
So I hope that you got a little giggle

240
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,321
out of that, I will
cherish this little video,

241
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:23,233
because I'll look back

242
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:24,603
and think of the things that he said.

243
00:08:24,603 --> 00:08:26,931
And I'm gonna continue
to write things down

244
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:28,346
that Jackson has said.

245
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,732
If your kids have said
anything that is funny,

246
00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:33,149
definitely write it in the comments below.

247
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,364
It is always funny what kids say.

248
00:08:35,364 --> 00:08:36,980
And it's a learning time,

249
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,631
I mean especially when
I was in the bathroom,

250
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,714
I was like, okay, I'm not just gonna say,

251
00:08:40,714 --> 00:08:42,522
no it's not a freckle
and not say anything,

252
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,224
I just thought well this
is a good opportunity.

253
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,296
I'll just tell him what it is,

254
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:47,216
and it hasn't been a big deal since.

255
00:08:47,216 --> 00:08:48,789
Kids are cute and kids are funny.

256
00:08:48,789 --> 00:08:50,965
Kids are innocent, and I love them

257
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:52,173
and I love you.
- Ahhhh.

258
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,909
- So thanks for doing this
video with me Jackson.

259
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,742
- (muffled) Okay.

260
00:08:55,742 --> 00:08:57,442
- Okay, should we say goodbye?

261
00:08:57,442 --> 00:08:59,241
- I need my mask first.

262
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,770
- Oh, where's your mask?

263
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,934
- Upstairs in your bedroom.

264
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:03,689
- Oh Daddy will go get it.

265
00:09:03,689 --> 00:09:06,341
We could not find Jackson's
Spiderman mask anywhere,

266
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:07,502
so we're just gonna have to end it

267
00:09:07,502 --> 00:09:09,667
with your Spiderman costume, huh?

268
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,500
- Yes.

269
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,573
- We'll go find it, I looked everywhere.

270
00:09:11,573 --> 00:09:14,647
Okay, thank you guys so much
for watching this video.

271
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:16,787
And we will see you in our next.

272
00:09:16,787 --> 00:09:17,704
- Okay bye.

273
00:09:18,659 --> 00:00:00,000
Pssht!
(laughs)
