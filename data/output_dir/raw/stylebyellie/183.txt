1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,512
(slow guitar music)

2
00:00:04,677 --> 00:00:07,749
- I think that in the
four years of us vlogging

3
00:00:07,749 --> 00:00:10,801
every single day, this has
been one of the hardest days

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,086
to pick up the camera and vlog.

5
00:00:13,086 --> 00:00:16,086
(slow guitar music)

6
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:27,934
♫ I'm still standing

7
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,200
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,290
♫ I'm still standing

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,208
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,949
♫ I'm still standing

11
00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:38,964
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

12
00:00:38,964 --> 00:00:40,005
(howling)

13
00:00:40,005 --> 00:00:42,936
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

14
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:45,186
Oh, that was me, not Penny.

15
00:00:47,472 --> 00:00:49,305
One, two, three, jump!

16
00:00:52,023 --> 00:00:54,185
I honestly feel like our
boys can give Miranda Sings

17
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:55,776
a huge run for her money.

18
00:00:55,776 --> 00:00:59,709
As far as being the number
one musician, magician,

19
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:03,876
actor, models, give me your
best model pose, Jackson.

20
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:07,559
(laughs)

21
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:10,288
Yeah!

22
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:13,613
The crowd goes wild.

23
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,637
Okay, now Calvin's turn.

24
00:01:15,637 --> 00:01:17,906
Give me your best model pose.

25
00:01:17,906 --> 00:01:18,739
The head bang.

26
00:01:18,739 --> 00:01:21,245
See, our kids have something
going for 'em already.

27
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,160
- They're so cute.

28
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,993
- Yay!

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,239
I don't care what kind of model pose it is

30
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:29,406
as long as you're healthy.

31
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:34,984
- My singer song is like this.

32
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:38,559
♫ I'm still standing

33
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:40,750
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

34
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,881
♫ I'm still standing

35
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:45,798
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah

36
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,676
Things from the future
have always amazed me,

37
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,799
like on Back to the Future,
science fiction stuff,

38
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,277
like the rehydrator
from Back to the Future:

39
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:55,860
pizza done so fast.

40
00:01:57,114 --> 00:01:59,531
(bell rings)

41
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:02,932
So cool.

42
00:02:02,932 --> 00:02:04,464
We're just putting
Jackson's bed back together,

43
00:02:04,464 --> 00:02:07,166
and I just wish there was a
way to put it back together

44
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,458
so much faster than just like folding

45
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,511
all the corners under and everything.

46
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:13,352
I may have come up with
a way, but I wish it was

47
00:02:13,352 --> 00:02:15,169
a little more mainstream
that everyone could partake

48
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,303
of this opportunity.

49
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:17,420
You know what I'm trying to say?

50
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,795
I'll show you what I mean.

51
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,061
Okay, you ready for this one?

52
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:21,496
Watch closely.

53
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:23,215
One, two, three.

54
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:24,420
Ha!

55
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,632
See, easy as pie.

56
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:29,005
Anyone can do that, I think.

57
00:02:29,005 --> 00:02:31,699
Guys, I gotta be up front
with you, straightforward.

58
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,878
I used camera tricks.

59
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:34,308
Sorry to disappoint you.

60
00:02:34,308 --> 00:02:35,424
It's the truth.

61
00:02:35,424 --> 00:02:37,944
See, you can see me putting
it together right now

62
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:40,211
as I'm telling you this.

63
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:43,796
Just camera tricks, Youtube
and camera tricks. I'm sorry.

64
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:45,207
Okay, fine, I'll pull out the camera.

65
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,207
Show me your cool trick.

66
00:02:48,151 --> 00:02:49,292
Whoa!

67
00:02:49,292 --> 00:02:51,417
Cool trick, dude.

68
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:54,164
You're so talented in multiple ways.

69
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:55,817
- I'm cool with this trick.

70
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:59,380
- [Jared] Yes, yes you are and
stylish moves like that, too.

71
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,236
- Yeah.

72
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:03,393
- I think in the four years of us vlogging

73
00:03:03,393 --> 00:03:06,544
every single day, this has
been one of the hardest days

74
00:03:06,544 --> 00:03:09,178
to pick up the camera and
vlog, and, as you can tell,

75
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:11,158
we haven't done a lot of that.

76
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,688
It's just been a pretty difficult day,

77
00:03:12,688 --> 00:03:13,839
especially for Ellie.

78
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:17,276
Last night was the
hardest night for Ellie.

79
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:21,461
She was in so much pain
for hours and hours.

80
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:25,385
It was excruciating for her,
and I felt so terrible for her,

81
00:03:25,385 --> 00:03:28,183
and, when I said yesterday
that she is resilient

82
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:30,819
and she's a trooper, I meant it.

83
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:34,023
Today has just been kind
of a hard day for her

84
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:36,469
and, with that, for us.

85
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:38,693
The whole process that
we wanted to go with this

86
00:03:38,693 --> 00:03:41,617
is, you know, we wanted to
go and do this naturally,

87
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:44,037
and then we used the medication.

88
00:03:44,037 --> 00:03:46,556
Then, we found out that
the medication didn't work,

89
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,588
and then the final result of
that is that we have to do

90
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:50,913
a DNC now.

91
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:53,236
Ellie has a DNC scheduled for tomorrow.

92
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:56,039
That is what she is
preparing for right now,

93
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,984
and, with anything related
to that kind of stuff,

94
00:03:58,984 --> 00:04:01,898
surgeries, medical procedures,
one of the hardest parts

95
00:04:01,898 --> 00:04:04,994
about that is that you can't
eat for a certain amount

96
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:08,593
of time, so I feel so
bad, but Ellie can't eat

97
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:11,743
half of the day today and half
of the morning 'til tomorrow.

98
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,224
I think she goes in like
at 11 o'clock tomorrow,

99
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:15,458
but her poor little tummy.

100
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,476
I just feel so bad that she's
not gonna be able to eat,

101
00:04:18,476 --> 00:04:20,481
especially when I'm eating
all of these delicious treats

102
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:21,314
right in front of her.

103
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:22,147
I'm kidding.

104
00:04:22,147 --> 00:04:22,980
I'm not gonna do that.

105
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,813
That's gonna be rude, Jared.

106
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,391
You're not gonna do that,
but the kids have just been

107
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,994
really sweet, just like you
saw in yesterday's video.

108
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,206
They've kinda been just all around Ellie

109
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:35,057
and being there for her and
just being sweet and tender.

110
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:37,989
Jackson has, I can't,
I think Calvin took it,

111
00:04:37,989 --> 00:04:40,744
and he's asleep now, but
Jackson, at preschool today,

112
00:04:40,744 --> 00:04:44,234
made a necklace for Ellie, and it was just

113
00:04:44,234 --> 00:04:46,286
the sweetest thing, because he came home,

114
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,192
and he went right up to her and said,

115
00:04:48,192 --> 00:04:50,424
"Mommy, I made this for
you," and that was just like

116
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,257
the sweetest thing.

117
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:52,593
I didn't tell him to do that.

118
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,142
I'm not sure if the teacher
told him to do that,

119
00:04:54,142 --> 00:04:55,435
but I didn't tell him.

120
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,959
I was like, "Jackson,
that's a cool necklace,"

121
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,908
and he's like, "Yeah, I
made it at preschool,"

122
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:01,665
so it's just cool to see
these little tender moments

123
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:04,919
from our kids and how
they can kinda see that

124
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,477
there is something going on

125
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:08,475
and how they're responding to that.

126
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:11,165
They're extra cuddly,
and they're extra sweet,

127
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,890
and it's just nice to see that.

128
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,634
That is where we are at right now.

129
00:05:16,634 --> 00:05:18,740
Tomorrow's gonna be a
pretty big day for Ellie,

130
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:22,565
preparing for that DNC, so
keep her in your thoughts

131
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:24,092
and prayers like you guys have.

132
00:05:24,092 --> 00:05:27,329
We really have felt it and
appreciate it, so thank you,

133
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:29,347
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

134
00:05:29,347 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
