1
00:00:00,891 --> 00:00:02,224
- What the heck?

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,130
- A thousand years, move over nature,

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,924
man's getting in the way.

4
00:00:09,924 --> 00:00:10,757
We're speeding things up.

5
00:00:10,757 --> 00:00:13,490
- Guys, I am 18 weeks along.

6
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:15,660
This pregnancy is flying by.

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,670
One month ago for Christmas, Jackson got,

8
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,940
what did you get for Christmas?

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,190
_ and a rock tumbler.

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,480
And for one month we have been listening

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,710
to this rock tumbler go, go, go, go, go.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,410
We have changed the grits,

13
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,740
we have saved a rock each time
we have changed the grits,

14
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,520
and now this little guy is so excited

15
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,161
that your Christmas
present is finally done.

16
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:39,507
- [Jared] You excited to see it?

17
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,340
- Yeah.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,200
- [Ellie] Okay, let's open it up.

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,020
- I'm gonna close my eyes.

20
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,079
- [Ellie] He likes surprises.

21
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,412
- I'm gonna hide

22
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:50,096
under the table.

23
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:52,180
- [Ellie] Okay, we're
gonna go get it okay.

24
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,650
- [Jared] Penny, do you remember this?

25
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,483
You smelling it?

26
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:01,070
That was your first collar.

27
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:04,360
This was Penny's first collar
when she was just a puppy.

28
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:06,303
- [Jackson] A little one?

29
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:07,553
- [Jared] Yeah.

30
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,972
Bring back memories?

31
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:11,597
- [Ellie] Typical, Dad does the hide work,

32
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:15,103
kids sit and wait until
the prize is ready.

33
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:16,370
- Jackson, he's like I wanna be surprised.

34
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,100
So he wants to hide.

35
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,270
- [Ellie] Okay, Daddy,
you do the dirty work

36
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,120
and then he wants to be surprised.

37
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,110
They're so beautiful.

38
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,277
- [Jared] Wow.

39
00:01:28,153 --> 00:01:29,486
- What the heck?

40
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,480
- [Ellie] Aren't those beautiful?

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,160
- Look at how shiny that is.

42
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,410
Look at that.

43
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,130
- [Ellie] Look at that
little tiny little blue one.

44
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,680
- You know what, this looks just like...

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,130
- [Ellie] Grandpa _ that
he got for his birthday.

46
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,556
We're gonna hang this in
their bathroom downstairs.

47
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:56,970
- No, I wanna put it out.

48
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,020
- [Ellie] You wanna take it out?

49
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,754
You have all of your rocks
that you have shined up now

50
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,730
that you can keep now.

51
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,840
Look at the pink one.

52
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:07,670
- We have a picture of this.

53
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,350
- [Ellie] Let's see, let's find it

54
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,220
in your rock book.

55
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,560
Jackson wants to find his rock.

56
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,630
Let's see what it looks like again.

57
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:19,910
Oh, is it the dalmatian stone on this row?

58
00:02:20,816 --> 00:02:21,649
On this row, can you find it?

59
00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:24,229
It's over here on this side.

60
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:25,251
Should we read up about it.

61
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,783
It's on page 25.

62
00:02:26,783 --> 00:02:27,950
Whoa, that is so cool.

63
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,034
Is that your favorite one?

64
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,000
- I want the other rocks.

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,570
- [Ellie] He is loving this.

66
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,340
So Jared just brought out another pack.

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,010
These are what they all looked like

68
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,560
when they started.

69
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,660
- So look,

70
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,840
look at that difference.

71
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,360
- [Ellie] So Jackson, did
you have fun doing that?

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,748
I think, should we do more?

73
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:50,581
- Yeah.

74
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:51,810
- I think we're gonna do another round.

75
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,090
We have a whole other bag.

76
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,520
We're gonna throw the bags in.

77
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,876
- I don't think you understand.

78
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,873
- [Ellie] Look at Penny's face.

79
00:02:58,873 --> 00:03:01,776
- We took 1,000 years of nature

80
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:05,003
and we made it into one month.

81
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:09,020
1,000 years, move over nature,
man's getting in the way.

82
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,110
We're speeding things up.

83
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,750
- [Ellie] We're gonna
do this another round.

84
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:14,490
We're gonna put all of
the rocks in and every

85
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,040
few days we're gonna take it out

86
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,460
and do the same thing.

87
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,723
So we'll see another
batch of these in a month.

88
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:23,881
- Look at the difference between this one

89
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:24,870
and the dalmatian.

90
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,480
Look how jagged those edges are.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,530
- Is this one polished?

92
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,363
- [Ellie] Not yet.

93
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:30,440
Do you wanna polish it?

94
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,770
That one's gonna look rad.

95
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,510
Okay, you put that in there.

96
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,675
- Something that I used to do as a kid

97
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:37,508
all of the time with my buddies

98
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,485
is we would take our Nerf guns

99
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,020
and we would shoot each other with them.

100
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,200
But not only that, we'd shoot each other

101
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,380
and we'd try to catch them.

102
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,670
So Ellie has her Nerf gun over there,

103
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,240
I'm gonna try and catch the ball.

104
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:51,760
(cheers)

105
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,990
You're aiming a little too high.

106
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,260
I was worried that it would go up again.

107
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,878
Try again.

108
00:03:55,878 --> 00:03:57,370
- Go.

109
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,360
- It hit the post.

110
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,390
Oh there it goes.

111
00:04:01,498 --> 00:04:02,519
- Alright, I'm ready.

112
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,269
- [Jared] Here we go.

113
00:04:06,885 --> 00:04:09,640
(laughter)

114
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,380
That was a strike and you missed.

115
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,840
It's kind of fun to do that.

116
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,750
I think what sparked
that when we were kids

117
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,400
was when the Matrix came
out and they did the whole..

118
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,310
And we're like, oh I bet
we could catch a bullet.

119
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,207
So we got our Nerf guns.

120
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:25,577
Sure enough, we practiced hard enough

121
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:26,598
that we were able to do it.

122
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:27,527
So it was pretty fun.

123
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,300
- Guys, I am 18 weeks along.

124
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,580
This pregnancy is flying by.

125
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,290
Baby is now, he is able
to swallow, hiccup, yawn.

126
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:38,390
He's rolling and kicking around.

127
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:40,790
I just set up my 20 week ultrasound.

128
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,790
Hopefully they can do a 3D one.

129
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,380
I don't believe I've had like
a really good 3D ultrasound

130
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,990
yet with any of my babies.

131
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:50,880
I'm so excited to do that this week.

132
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,990
But I wanted to sit down and talk about

133
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,507
how I've been feeling and update about me

134
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:57,500
and somethings that I have got.

135
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,970
So I'm gonna start with some of things

136
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,650
that I have purchased because that's kind

137
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:02,290
of the most fun right now.

138
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,360
I have purchased a few things for me

139
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,950
and a few things for the baby.

140
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,770
So I showed you guys a baby blanket

141
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,220
that my mom had started
with her oldest baby,

142
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:13,250
but she didn't finish
until baby number five,

143
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,160
me, came along.

144
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,670
That was in my nursery.

145
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,701
I pulled it out and I thought
why, I'm gonna use this.

146
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,280
It's so cute.

147
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,310
It has woodland creatures on it.

148
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,050
So this is the baby bedding that I found

149
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,750
that I purchased on Etsy.

150
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,834
It should be coming, it's not
gonna come til like March.

151
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:33,180
That is coming.

152
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,530
I thought that would be really cute

153
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,873
with the little woodland creatures

154
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:38,830
and we'll find him a little
animal to have in his crib.

155
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:40,610
That's what I bought for him.

156
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,810
Then I got these from Copper Pearl.

157
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,090
You guys suggested that on Twitter.

158
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,901
I asked a few baby places
that you guys liked.

159
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:51,330
It's funny because once I got these,

160
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,340
I was like oh.

161
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,330
Jared had got a sample of a few baby items

162
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,840
when he went to a Studio C filming.

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,410
In that was some Copper Pearl bandanas.

164
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,980
I was like, oh how fun.

165
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,560
I got some burp rags for baby

166
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,390
and I thought that these
designs were really cute.

167
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,376
These are teepees, these are trees.

168
00:06:12,376 --> 00:06:15,230
They're long, really big, really soft.

169
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,960
They're gonna be perfect for when

170
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,180
the baby spits up everywhere.

171
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,480
Unless he's not one to spit up,

172
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,500
I don't believe Calvin
was much to spit up.

173
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,610
I don't remember him spitting up tons.

174
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,550
Then some feathers.

175
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,060
I got those.

176
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,790
I also got some nipple cream.

177
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,710
With Jackson I used the lanolin cream

178
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:34,644
that they give you at the hospital.

179
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:37,440
With Calvin I just used coconut oil.

180
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,440
With this baby, I was on
Thyme Maternity, T H Y M E.

181
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,140
They have some clothing,

182
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,440
one of you guys suggested that company.

183
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,970
And I saw some nipple cream

184
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,190
and I thought, I'm gonna get some.

185
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:51,690
I've never really purchased any.

186
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:56,380
It's a beast to nurse and
day three is the worst

187
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,590
because you start to
crack, it gets kinda bad.

188
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,840
So I'm hoping by using a good nipple cream

189
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,130
I can prevent that.

190
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,850
So I got some cream on that website.

191
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,690
It doesn't smell, it's really thick.

192
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,730
So we'll see how that goes.

193
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,870
On that same website, I bought a really

194
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,460
pretty maternity blouse.

195
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,140
This is really, really
stretchy, really long

196
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,860
and it fits so pretty.

197
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:20,380
Jared and I, I think we're
gonna be able to go to

198
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,290
this baby tech conference where they have

199
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,230
tons of new baby gear and
I wanna look really cute

200
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,250
for the event and feel really spruced up.

201
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,540
So I got this shirt from there.

202
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,440
Sunday's are kind of miserable for me

203
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,500
because my tights are too tight.

204
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,470
If I don't wear tights, we're in winter,

205
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,937
and I just wanna be warm
and I like wearing nylons,

206
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:42,380
nylons or tights.

207
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,380
So I finally, finally bought
some maternity nylons.

208
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,790
These are from A Pea in a Pod Maternity

209
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,521
and they will go up above my belly.

210
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,990
So hopefully I'll be much more comfortable

211
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,930
on Sunday's at church.

212
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,810
Then I also got a dress.

213
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:04,930
This is just a really simple dress.

214
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,920
This is from A Pea in a
Pod and then right here

215
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,380
it has a cute little detail at the bottom.

216
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,330
Those are some of the
things that I have bought

217
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,670
for me and the baby.

218
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,690
As far as foods and cravings
and what I have been eating,

219
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:18,350
I have been loving salads.

220
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,430
And I'm not a salad person.

221
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,964
I definitely don't make
a lot of salads at home.

222
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:28,964
I love Costa Vita salads,
_ salads, Zupa salads.

223
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,250
If I go out to eat, that's typically what

224
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,480
I've been getting.

225
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,180
They just tasted really good.

226
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:37,239
Last night I made a salad.

227
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,020
It's really not the healthiest dressing,

228
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,170
but it's flipping good.

229
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,140
It's like a mimic of
Texas Roadhouse dressing.

230
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,560
It's like a cup of mayo,
a cup of buttermilk,

231
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,680
and a little bit of

232
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,600
the Hidden Valley seasoning to
make your own salad dressing.

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,860
You mix that together.

234
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,281
I just had that with a
bunch of green lettuce

235
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:03,370
and carrots and a boiled
egg and tomatoes on it.

236
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,840
It was so good.

237
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,410
I've been loving salads.

238
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,360
Other than that, I don't
think I've been like

239
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,290
have one certain food that I've
been loving, loving lately.

240
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:15,640
I still have not been a huge
fan of sweets and treats.

241
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,930
With all of my pregnancies,
all of these being boys,

242
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,140
I have never been one to
really want tons of sweets.

243
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,170
I've been really liking hearty foods.

244
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,520
Like the other day I got
a bunch of coconut yogurt,

245
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,580
cut up banana, some raspberries
and strawberries in that.

246
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,510
That tasted so good to me.

247
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,900
That to me was like a sweet treat

248
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,720
but it wasn't like candy.

249
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,800
I really liked that.

250
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,263
How my body has been feeling,

251
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:44,130
I can't believe that I'm 18 weeks along.

252
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,440
I'm almost halfway.

253
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,220
My belly isn't huge, but it's there.

254
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,230
But I've really felt
like I physically ache.

255
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,440
My back has been hurting
really, really bad.

256
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,540
The my stomach right here,
all my babies sit low,

257
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,091
my stomach just hurts so
bad and it's so tight.

258
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:05,504
I've been going to the chiropractor
for the last few weeks.

259
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:10,504
Going to the chiropractor
really has saved my sanity

260
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,610
in a sense.

261
00:10:12,568 --> 00:10:14,710
I've really enjoyed going
to see my chiropractor.

262
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,710
I only go, like a five minute appointment.

263
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,340
She does everything she needs to do,

264
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,630
we sit and talk for a
minute, it's kinda refreshing

265
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,250
just to talk to a friend
and then I'm done.

266
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,170
Then I see her in another week.

267
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,520
I can tell when I need to go back

268
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,070
because like two days
before my appointment,

269
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,020
my body will really start to ache,

270
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,030
my neck will start to get really tight,

271
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,480
and I'll have a lot of tension.

272
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
I'll just know that I need
to go see the chiropractor.

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,130
That's something that I
have really done for myself

274
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,250
that I'm really glad that I have done.

275
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,500
I have always wanted to do
lots of maternity massages

276
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,620
during a pregnancy.

277
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,360
That would be like a dream.

278
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,420
But really, this is what's helped me.

279
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,545
I physically feel really good.

280
00:10:57,545 --> 00:11:02,000
I think soon I would love to
go get a pregnancy massage.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,470
But I really love that
Jared will rub my feet,

282
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,600
he'll rub my back and that
makes me feel so good at night.

283
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,080
Jared will rub my back at night

284
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,160
and it just is something that
he's always willing to do

285
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,710
but especially me being pregnant.

286
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,140
It's been really nice.

287
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:19,320
I want you to sit down
and just talk with us

288
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,740
and with you guys.

289
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,700
- Glad to be here on our vlog.

290
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,150
- I know, on our vlog.

291
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,520
Just how it's been our last few weeks.

292
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,810
I went to film a pregnancy
update like two weeks ago

293
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,070
and after I'd started for a minute,

294
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,290
I just, I think Jared was like,

295
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,340
oh my gosh, what's wrong.

296
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,780
I threw the camera down,

297
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,570
I'm like whatever, I'm not doing this.

298
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,650
I was just mad.

299
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,891
I have learned that us
filming for four years,

300
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:46,610
if I'm gonna film something,

301
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,330
especially if there's
a lot of emotion to it,

302
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:54,330
I can't share how I feel unless I

303
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,010
feel okay about sharing it.

304
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:01,380
I wasn't feeling very well mentally.

305
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,060
It's taken me about two
and half, three weeks

306
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,220
to get out of my funk.

307
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,650
It's taken a long time.

308
00:12:08,502 --> 00:12:12,010
I don't even know what's caused it.

309
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,760
I told Jared that the first
week that it was happening,

310
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,070
I told him, I'm like I feel
like I have post partum

311
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,210
depression right now.

312
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,320
My body, my mind.

313
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,370
I just felt like I felt
like after I had Calvin.

314
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,170
I was like, I don't feel myself at all.

315
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,600
- Yeah.

316
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,439
We've noticed that.

317
00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,500
But it's not the worst thing in the world.

318
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,540
I think it goes to show that

319
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:40,950
there's some factors
that go along with this.

320
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,650
We're in the middle of wintertime.

321
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,570
There is something true
about being outside

322
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,300
where it's warm that
just lifts your spirits.

323
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,760
That is definitely true.

324
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,890
We're having a hard time
potty training Calvin.

325
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,630
- And just life.

326
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,940
- We have our ups and downs with it.

327
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,110
Some days are good, some days are bad.

328
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,958
And that's another thing.

329
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,070
Just the fact that you're pregnant

330
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,880
and going through all of
these changes physically,

331
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,950
hormonally, emotionally.

332
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,730
All of that plays into that.

333
00:13:10,871 --> 00:13:13,590
And putting your life
out there is a big thing.

334
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,570
I feel like that has had a big factor

335
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,927
in how you are taking
each day as it comes.

336
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:20,760
- Yeah.

337
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,340
- I've seen the low and the lows

338
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,780
and I've see the high and the highs

339
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,810
and I see them come in
waves and everything.

340
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,340
But you always come out of it,

341
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,760
which is a great things.

342
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,860
Like today's been really good

343
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,210
and some other days have been like okay,

344
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,470
let's see what we can
do to make Mom happy.

345
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,540
I have those days too
and I'm not pregnant.

346
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,410
I have those days when
I'm like okay Ellie,

347
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,320
I need you to help me out.

348
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,770
I need you to get that
shovel because I'm down deep

349
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,200
and you need to dig me out.

350
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,033
- Yeah.

351
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:52,210
I think it's been good that
I've been potty training

352
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,740
too Calvin because it's forced me to like

353
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,495
just be in a bubble like in the house.

354
00:13:58,495 --> 00:14:00,794
There's pros and cons
to that like you said.

355
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:01,627
- Cabin fever.

356
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:02,460
- Cabin fever.

357
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,960
It's been good for me
because I've just like

358
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,430
distanced myself with like the camera.

359
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,750
I've been able to just
sit and film my emotions.

360
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,620
I've thought a lot about my miscarriages

361
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,510
and those were really
just a few months ago.

362
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:20,810
I've been pregnant a lot
which is crazy to even say.

363
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:24,580
I'm still sad about that.

364
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,340
Those emotions come back still.

365
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,500
I think that the last
few weeks I've just been

366
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,150
feeling a lot of that.

367
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,674
I've definitely learned
that after I had Calvin,

368
00:14:33,674 --> 00:14:37,900
if I just tell myself buck up and be good,

369
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,950
I can do that and that'll
fix it for a minute,

370
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,540
but it'll come back 10 times worse.

371
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,746
So it's felt good to me to just
sit and feel those emotions

372
00:14:46,746 --> 00:14:49,550
and then to really come out of that.

373
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:52,140
I feel really good the last few days.

374
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,150
I feel like I'm coming out of that.

375
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,900
So I'm starting to feel better

376
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:00,120
and now I'm more willing to
sit and just talk about it.

377
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,510
- Absolutely.

378
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,463
You should always feel through the

379
00:15:04,463 --> 00:15:07,170
length of the emotion.

380
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,150
You should never try and
bottle those emotions up.

381
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,959
You let those emotions play out.

382
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,490
Whether you're sad, let
yourself be sad for awhile.

383
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,170
Let yourself be mad for a little while.

384
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,510
Then process that.

385
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,260
Then become happy or whatever.

386
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,410
Allow yourself to process those emotions.

387
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,480
- Anything else we wanna talk about?

388
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,690
Baby names I think.
- Let's see.

389
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,998
- People wanna know baby names.

390
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,510
- I think we're still right where we are.

391
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,950
- Nothing new there.

392
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,200
Can I tell them a few
baby names that I like?

393
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,273
- I'll allow it.

394
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,543
- You'll allow it.

395
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,376
- I'll allow it.

396
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:43,850
- Mason is still one that we really like.

397
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,990
I love that Jackson loves that name.

398
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,760
- Yes, as far as Jackson's concerned,

399
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,400
that's the baby's name.

400
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,360
- The baby's Mason.

401
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:55,730
We haven't talked about it
a lot in the house anymore,

402
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,460
because at first we were really excited

403
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,710
and I really thought that
was gonna be his name.

404
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,900
Then after a minute, I was like,

405
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm just gonna not talk about it too much.

406
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,420
I don't want it to get stuck

407
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,300
and us think that we
have to name him Mason.

408
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,830
So we've really been just brainstorming.

409
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,230
I love the name Mason.

410
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,090
I really like the name Dean.

411
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,280
And Jared still really
loves the name Dallon.

412
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,460
- Right.

413
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,930
- I love the name Dallon,
but I worry that it's

414
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,560
a little close to Calvin.

415
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,380
It doesn't matter at the end of the night.

416
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,800
- That's the thing is,
these things like that

417
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,020
it doesn't matter whether
they're too close,

418
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,360
whether they're a cousin's name,

419
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,484
whether they're an old friend's name.

420
00:16:33,484 --> 00:16:34,994
Those things don't matter
because they become

421
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,827
their own person.

422
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:37,385
But when you're thinking about it,

423
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:39,680
it's like okay, will
that play a role in how

424
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,610
we say their names or anything like that.

425
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,520
It's just something in
the back of your mind.

426
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,070
I think we've been really
trying hard to come up

427
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,342
with names that like, Jackson, Calvin.

428
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,440
I think we've been trying
to find names that fit that

429
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,640
framework.

430
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,700
- Fit it well.

431
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,650
So we're still thinking of baby names.

432
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,070
My ultrasound's coming up,
that's gonna be a huge day for us

433
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,490
to see the baby and see...

434
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,115
- Everything.

435
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,044
- Really details.

436
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:07,877
- I didn't get to go
to your last ultrasound

437
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:09,482
so I'm like I hope...

438
00:17:09,482 --> 00:17:11,420
- And I hardly was able to
see him, it was kinda funny.

439
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,859
- That is our vlog for the day.

440
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:15,796
That is our 18 weeks pregnancy update.

441
00:17:15,797 --> 00:17:16,912
- Baby update.

442
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,319
- Can you believe that,
we're 18 weeks pregnant?

443
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,790
- I can't believe it.

444
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,719
That's the babysitter.

445
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,810
- All in all, things are going well.

446
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,440
Of course we have ups,
of course we have downs.

447
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,640
That's part of life.

448
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,830
But the important thing
is that when you're going

449
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,150
through the down, that you
realize that it's not the end.

450
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:33,910
Then you find your way up out of it.

451
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:34,940
Because no matter what,

452
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,253
there's light at the end of the tunnel.

453
00:17:37,253 --> 00:17:39,930
The day is always darkest before the dawn.

454
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:42,980
No matter what Ellie, no matter
how hard you day has been,

455
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,521
I will be here for you.

456
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,354
- Well thanks.

457
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:47,850
It's been nice to just like vent

458
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,233
and complain or

459
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:52,439
just vent.

460
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,270
- Because it's important
to feel those emotions.

461
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,170
- Right Calvin?

462
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,200
- Right Calvin?

463
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,550
- I love being married

464
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,580
and one of the things
with being married is

465
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,940
you support each other.

466
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,930
It's been really nice for Jared

467
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:06,440
to be able to support me right now.

468
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,840
I appreciate that.

469
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,610
Thank you guys so much for watching.

470
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,850
And we'll see you guys tomorrow.

471
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,170
Hopefully we can go like to
a movie tonight or something.

472
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,398
I'm trying to get a
babysitter so we'll see.

473
00:18:18,398 --> 00:18:19,583
We'll see you guys later.

474
00:18:19,583 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
