1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,590
- Holy crap, my heart is
pumping out of my chest.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,007
- Oh my gosh, guys, we only
have three months left.

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,823
- I cannot believe this
is happening right now.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,286
I'm not used to seeing
your body like this.

5
00:00:12,286 --> 00:00:13,432
- [Ellie] (laughs)

6
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:17,073
- Got your butt!

7
00:00:17,073 --> 00:00:21,438
- Ow, my arm! (groans)

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,438
- Ha, I won!

9
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,681
- Jackson thinks just because
he got a new pair of pants

10
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:31,992
that is a size five,
that he can now beat Mom.

11
00:00:31,992 --> 00:00:34,656
I'm still in charge of you.

12
00:00:34,656 --> 00:00:36,270
Let's see 'em, turn around.

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,917
He just got a new pair of
pants 'cause all of his

14
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:41,525
pants he has outgrown,
and I bet here in like

15
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:44,290
two or three weeks, they'll
fit him even better.

16
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:48,503
I just at the beginning of
winter, I bought Jackson

17
00:00:48,503 --> 00:00:51,632
some pants and they didn't fit,
and I was gonna return them.

18
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:53,809
Two weeks later, they all
of the sudden fit him,

19
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,753
and then the other day, he
came upstairs with those

20
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:58,350
same pants on, I was like, "Are
you wearing Calvin's pants?"

21
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,970
'Cause they're just one size apart,

22
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,480
and he totally needed some
more pants, that's crazy.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,371
- You dare fight my wife, huh?

24
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,809
- [Ellie] (chuckles) You're smiling now,

25
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:11,769
but now when Dad gets mad. (laughs)

26
00:01:11,769 --> 00:01:12,602
Ahh!

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,940
- I have something to tell you!

28
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,773
A secret!

29
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:18,938
I'm not left-handed!

30
00:01:18,938 --> 00:01:20,510
Hwah, haa!

31
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,343
Name that movie!

32
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,494
Isn't it crazy that it
just seemed like yesterday.

33
00:01:28,494 --> 00:01:30,290
Why is my sword floppy? (Ellie laughs)

34
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,553
It just seems like yesterday
that we were praying

35
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:37,874
and going to doctors to
have this little Jackson,

36
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:41,370
and now he's in size five...

37
00:01:42,758 --> 00:01:43,591
Pants!

38
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:48,055
(grunting)

39
00:01:51,552 --> 00:01:55,710
- Ah! His leg. (chuckling)

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,993
You are the champion, my friend.

41
00:02:00,223 --> 00:02:02,540
Put your arms up, look nice and proud!

42
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,377
Say, "I'm the winner!"

43
00:02:04,377 --> 00:02:05,506
- Yeah!

44
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:06,816
(Jared grunts)
(Ellie yelps)

45
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:07,995
(Jared and Ellie laugh)

46
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:09,473
- [Jared] I meant to get his stomach!

47
00:02:09,473 --> 00:02:12,810
- [Ellie] Hey, shucks! (laughs)

48
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,940
He gotcha good!

49
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,860
(laughing) Right in the crotch.

50
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,771
We're trying to see who woke who up.

51
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,531
It was Jackson.

52
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,160
- [Jared] It looks like Calvin.

53
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,889
- [Ellie] Last night at
like, yeah, 3:37, we both

54
00:02:24,889 --> 00:02:29,780
woke up to giggling, and
laughing, and screaming.

55
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,488
And they were laughing, and
what did we do, Jackson?

56
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,640
- I wanna watch (mumbling).

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,776
- [Ellie] Jackson, what did
Dad do when you were laughing?

58
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:39,190
- Did I tell you to go back to bed?

59
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,430
Yeah, I did.

60
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,530
- [Ellie] Tell me what he said.

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,200
Did he go, "Go back to bed!"

62
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,927
- Dad cried me.

63
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:46,245
- [Ellie] Then you cried.

64
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,540
What did he say?

65
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,373
- Dad cried me.

66
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:50,830
- (laughing) Jackson cried.

67
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,559
'Cause Jared was like,
"I'm not doing this,

68
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,181
"it's 3:00 in the morning."

69
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,051
But it was really funny that
they both woke up laughing.

70
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:02,051
Lincoln, you are one different toddler.

71
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,670
He talks so good. (laughing)

72
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,880
And he's just curious.

73
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,890
- I want water, I'm gonna go downstairs.

74
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,120
- Bye, Linc!

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,786
I have never had a spray
tan, but when I woke up

76
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:13,961
this morning I was like,
(gasps) "It's beautiful!"

77
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,120
Like, I just feel fresh for spring.

78
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,200
Did you love it?

79
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,050
- Oh, I'm so brown and
perfect, and I love it.

80
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,702
I wish I had my makeup on!

81
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:25,094
- I woke up and felt like,
"Okay, I'm glad that I did that."

82
00:03:25,094 --> 00:03:27,120
Not a regret there.

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,953
- No, not at all.

84
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:28,792
I love it, because it's like in the--

85
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:31,551
(Ellie and Bonnie laugh)
- Jared likes my body.

86
00:03:31,551 --> 00:03:33,766
- (laughing) I do.

87
00:03:33,766 --> 00:03:36,160
I think you're so beautiful.

88
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,070
Okay, so here's the thing.

89
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,370
I would've loved you no matter what,

90
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,550
with or without the spray tan.

91
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,270
I think that's like something
I have to make clear,

92
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,196
like we'll do a little
asterisk, like no matter what.

93
00:03:43,196 --> 00:03:44,550
Wait! Wait!

94
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,223
But seeing you tan like
this in the middle of March

95
00:03:48,223 --> 00:03:51,273
is like, I'm not used to
seeing your body like this.

96
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,357
I like it a lot.

97
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,360
- [Bonnie] Yes!
- (laughs)

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,415
We've been filming all morning,
but we are sitting down,

99
00:03:56,415 --> 00:04:00,843
and we are choosing eight
winners for our Bollie bag!

100
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:03,660
- Our giveaway, we're
choosing our winners!

101
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,263
- Yes, so we are going through emails,

102
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:07,610
we are choosing you, we're announcing it.

103
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,070
By the time you guys see this video,

104
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,970
it's clear, done and done.

105
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,798
So thank you guys so
much for participating!

106
00:04:12,798 --> 00:04:15,159
- And if you haven't seen
Bollie Brand already,

107
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,600
BollieBrand.com in the
description down below.

108
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,135
Okay, generate.
- Taking us two computers

109
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,858
to do this. (chuckling)

110
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:24,610
- Number, at random, number...

111
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,673
1056. (laughs)

112
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:29,031
One zero five six!

113
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:30,000
(Ellie laughs)

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,921
- One-thousand-fifty-six!

115
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:33,320
- There we go.

116
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,440
- We can't math today, it's Friday.

117
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,072
- I like seeing your guys' names.

118
00:04:37,072 --> 00:04:38,327
Your usernames.
- I do, too.

119
00:04:38,327 --> 00:04:39,990
- So far we have four winners.

120
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,188
- 1143!

121
00:04:41,188 --> 00:04:43,480
- Yeah, you're our lucky winner!

122
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,520
Generate.

123
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,857
- 1064!

124
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:47,610
(laughs)

125
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,000
One-thousand-sixty-four!

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,917
(laughs)

127
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,480
I'm so sorry.

128
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,760
- I think you're hilarious.

129
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,913
- Do you regret being a partner with me?

130
00:04:56,913 --> 00:04:58,888
(both laugh)

131
00:04:58,888 --> 00:05:00,344
- Okay, generate!

132
00:05:00,344 --> 00:05:02,550
- I'm so, I suck at everything.

133
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,950
- 2,444.

134
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,017
- [Jared] Good job!

135
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:06,744
- Thanks, Ellie.

136
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:08,780
- This is so fun.

137
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,008
- I cannot believe this
is happening right now.

138
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:12,320
I think this is the only time that

139
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,110
I've ever seen Instagram go down.

140
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:16,120
- Down.

141
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,280
- And it's right when we're
doing an Instagram giveaway.

142
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,180
Like, Instagram, what is going on?

143
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,632
I hope this doesn't have
to do with like the whole

144
00:05:22,632 --> 00:05:25,780
Facebook, Russia, like all of that stuff.

145
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,530
Or leaking information, I don't know

146
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,536
what the whole Facebook thing is.

147
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,569
- I'm out of the loop.

148
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:31,462
- I was gonna say I
have no idea. (chuckles)

149
00:05:31,462 --> 00:05:32,923
- (laughs) Current events, ladies.

150
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:34,590
(Jared and Bonnie laugh)

151
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,344
So, um, maybe we're
gonna take a little break

152
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:39,050
from this until Instagram
gets their servers back up,

153
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,590
because we can't load a darn
thing on Instagram right now.

154
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,582
- Those are cute.

155
00:05:42,582 --> 00:05:43,415
- Aren't those cute?

156
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:44,863
- Oh, they're already
off doing something else.

157
00:05:44,863 --> 00:05:45,740
Squirrel!

158
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,255
- Jackson just said, "Why
were you gone so long?"

159
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:49,990
I sorry.

160
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,937
What do you want to do now?

161
00:05:51,937 --> 00:05:52,770
- Paw Patrol puzzle!

162
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,073
- Build a Paw Patrol puzzle!

163
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,849
'Kay, go get your Paw Patrol
puzzle, we'll build it, 'kay?

164
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,017
(chuckles)

165
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,323
What is that, Calvin?

166
00:06:02,323 --> 00:06:03,745
- [Calvin] Um, hat.

167
00:06:03,745 --> 00:06:06,577
- [Ellie] It's a coat, oh,
and that's, what's that one?

168
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:07,410
- [Calvin] Hat.

169
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,465
- [Ellie] It's a hat?

170
00:06:08,465 --> 00:06:10,164
- How does he know how?

171
00:06:10,164 --> 00:06:11,513
- [Ellie] He's doing good!

172
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:13,929
Oh, not there.

173
00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:15,053
- [Jackson] Nope.

174
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,227
I bet.

175
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:17,346
- [Jared] You bet?

176
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:18,179
- Yep.

177
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,241
- [Jared] You bet they go together?

178
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:20,074
- Yep.

179
00:06:20,074 --> 00:06:21,678
- [Ellie] What is your favorite toy?

180
00:06:21,678 --> 00:06:22,860
- Puzzle.

181
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,910
- [Ellie] Puzzles?

182
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,810
And what's your favorite toy outside?

183
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,820
- Finding rocks.

184
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:30,032
- [Ellie] Finding rocks? (chuckles)

185
00:06:30,032 --> 00:06:31,082
- [Jackson] See.

186
00:06:31,082 --> 00:06:32,936
(Calvin vocalizing)

187
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,282
- [Ellie] Good job.

188
00:06:34,282 --> 00:06:36,273
(laughing)

189
00:06:36,273 --> 00:06:39,316
(Calvin wailing)

190
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,910
I'll close the door, don't
worry, I'll close it.

191
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,230
- [Jackson] No, I will!

192
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,539
- [Ellie] Oh, thanks, Jacks.

193
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,406
- [Jared] 'Kay, you got it?

194
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,370
Okay.

195
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:48,419
- [Ellie] Hold on tight.

196
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,750
'Kay, don't let go.

197
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,340
Hold on, Dad's gonna lift you up.

198
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,173
- Hang on tight.

199
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:53,100
Are you hanging on tight, Jackson?

200
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,933
- Yep.

201
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,248
- [Ellie] (laughs)

202
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,417
Whoa, woo-hoo!

203
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,904
Hold on, don't let go.

204
00:07:01,904 --> 00:07:03,308
(Calvin giggling)

205
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,647
(chuckles) Is Dad strong enough?

206
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:08,980
(Ellie and Jared laugh)

207
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,450
- You're such a good helper.

208
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,494
- [Jackson] I wanna try it now.

209
00:07:14,494 --> 00:07:16,260
- [Jared] Don't pull it,
Jackson, don't pull it.

210
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,360
- [Ellie] (laughs)

211
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,024
Good job.

212
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,510
- [Jackson] I wanna try.

213
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,680
- [Ellie] Here, jump on.

214
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,210
- [Jared] Grab on the
front, hang on the front.

215
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,290
- [Ellie] It's heavy, huh?

216
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,200
It's a beast.

217
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,740
- [Jared] All right, hang on to the front.

218
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,460
- [Ellie] Okay, this
is getting a hot mess.

219
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,859
Jared, just put it down.

220
00:07:29,859 --> 00:07:32,420
- Would you like to see
what I have in this box?

221
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,253
- [Jackson] Yes!

222
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,443
- You would?

223
00:07:34,443 --> 00:07:37,110
Well, would't you like to follow me?

224
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,611
And I would like to show
you what's in this box.

225
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:41,865
- [Ellie] Would you
like some help? (laughs)

226
00:07:41,865 --> 00:07:44,301
- Wouldn't you like to know!

227
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,134
- [Ellie] Woo, I like!

228
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,957
- It's a piece of wood, if
you didn't get the joke.

229
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:51,720
- [Ellie] Awesome.

230
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,280
- We're making some changes
in that baby's room,

231
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,155
and you already know this,
but we can't give away

232
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:59,106
everything all at once, so stay tuned

233
00:07:59,106 --> 00:08:01,160
for more baby room updates.

234
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,466
You saw a little bit.

235
00:08:02,466 --> 00:08:04,612
Wouldn't you like to see more?

236
00:08:04,612 --> 00:08:07,033
(laughs loudly)

237
00:08:07,033 --> 00:08:10,220
- Who's ready for a maternity try-on haul?

238
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,053
I am!

239
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,378
I have two dresses that
I have recently got

240
00:08:14,378 --> 00:08:17,095
for the rest of my maternity.

241
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,516
I literally don't need
to buy anything else

242
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:21,540
for maternity clothes.

243
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,480
But our family is doing a
photo shoot for the cookbook,

244
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,660
and I got this dress for the photo shoot,

245
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,078
and now I'm like, "Maybe
I should wear this dress

246
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,448
"for maternity pictures."

247
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:34,998
I'll show you the dress that I'm going

248
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:36,958
to wear for maternity pictures,

249
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,904
and there's a reason why
I'm gonna wear that one.

250
00:08:38,905 --> 00:08:42,457
Even though I think this
gown is very beautiful,

251
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:46,503
I really want to be able to show my belly

252
00:08:46,503 --> 00:08:49,429
in my maternity pictures without me having

253
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,620
to like hold my belly, you know?

254
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,500
Like even though you can see it.

255
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,740
Well I don't know, in like
eight weeks, it's gonna be huge.

256
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,040
This is beautiful.

257
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,231
I thought I was gonna have
to alter it like crazy.

258
00:09:00,231 --> 00:09:01,840
I mean, it's a little bustly.

259
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,007
It's beautiful.

260
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,420
It fits great!

261
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,188
Okay, I got this from Pink Blush,

262
00:09:06,188 --> 00:09:08,842
and then I am going to try on my other one

263
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:11,544
that I'm gonna actually
wear for maternity pictures,

264
00:09:11,544 --> 00:09:13,560
unless I try it on and I don't like it.

265
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,940
Okay, before I take the dress off,

266
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,287
when my sisters and I were ordering,

267
00:09:17,287 --> 00:09:20,306
or choosing outfits for
the family photo shoot,

268
00:09:20,306 --> 00:09:23,400
Julie got the same dress,
so she's gonna wear

269
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,124
a cream dress, I'm
gonna wear a pink dress,

270
00:09:25,124 --> 00:09:28,300
and I'm actually, and
Julie's actually planning

271
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:32,390
on wearing this pretty
much this whole summer

272
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,960
after we have our babies,
because this'll be

273
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,710
perfect to nurse in as well.

274
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,830
So I think this is gonna be
really, I'm like, I'm shocked.

275
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,663
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

276
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:41,760
I'm gonna try this one on.

277
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,375
Okay, and this is the dress I want to wear

278
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,820
for maternity pictures.

279
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,770
It's a little different.

280
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,450
A lot of maternity pictures are these

281
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,024
really flowy, pretty dresses.

282
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:53,670
But I thought that this
looked a lot like me.

283
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,520
I really like it, the flower sleeves,

284
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:59,833
I like the length of it, I
like that it's not too flowy.

285
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,418
I need a white bra, not a pink one.

286
00:10:02,418 --> 00:10:05,540
And then by the time I'm
actually take pictures,

287
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,410
my belly will be much bigger.

288
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,650
But you know what, with this one, I might

289
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,750
have to hold my belly, too, for pictures.

290
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,780
You know what?

291
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,710
I might just do pictures
with both outfits.

292
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,966
I think I love this, though,
for my maternity pictures,

293
00:10:17,966 --> 00:10:22,005
'cause it's just white, and
pretty, and crisp, and yay!

294
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,350
Yay! (laughs)

295
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,740
Oh my gosh, guys.

296
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,930
We only have three months left.

297
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,190
Three months left!

298
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,415
That's crazy.

299
00:10:31,415 --> 00:10:36,165
- Holy crap, my heart is
pumping out of my chest.

300
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:37,692
That was crazy.

301
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,118
You guys know that every once and a while,

302
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:41,974
I will stream on Twitch, I'll
have the link down below,

303
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,010
Twitch.tv/JaredMecham.

304
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:46,237
And I've been playing
Fortnite because everyone's

305
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:48,843
playing Fortnite, it's a really fun game.

306
00:10:48,843 --> 00:10:53,270
And I was in the top two positions,

307
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:57,000
so it was me versus this
other guy out of 100...

308
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,720
And I lost, ugh!

309
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,720
My hands were so sweaty.

310
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,290
But that was so much fun to stream,

311
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,720
there was like 80 people
in the stream with me,

312
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,387
it was just a ton of fun.

313
00:11:06,387 --> 00:11:09,130
I want to do that a little bit
more, especially with Ellie.

314
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,360
We've been saying for years
that we want to stream,

315
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,410
like, Mario games and stuff like that.

316
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,000
So anyway, the night is upon
us, the kids are in bed,

317
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,910
we are going to eat dinner
and call it a night.

318
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,990
So thank you guys so much
for watching the video.

319
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,710
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.

320
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,560
Check out the description, and we will

321
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,170
see you guys next time.

322
00:11:26,170 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
