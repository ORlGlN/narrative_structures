1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,245
- [Jared] Are you hiding?

2
00:00:01,245 --> 00:00:02,078
- Mmm.

3
00:00:02,078 --> 00:00:02,960
- [Jared] Okay, get down, hurry get down

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,920
before he sees you.

5
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,170
He's counting.

6
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,090
He's coming.

7
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:07,548
Hide, hide hide hide hide hide hide hide.

8
00:00:07,548 --> 00:00:10,715
(gentle guitar music)

9
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,492
Is this your hiding spot?

10
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:13,625
- Yeah.

11
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:15,291
- [Jared] Okay. (laughs)

12
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,366
- I'm hiding here.

13
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,749
(banging)

14
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:20,570
- Where's Calvin?

15
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,523
- [Jared] I don't know, follow the noise.

16
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:26,190
(banging)

17
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,230
Oh my gosh Calvin, no no no oh jeez.

18
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,680
Oh my gosh, I was wondering
what that sound was,

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,530
oh crap.

20
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,870
Don't leave tools in your office.

21
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,740
Okay, out of my office, let's go.

22
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,090
Oh my goodness, there's--

23
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,070
awww, I hope the keyboard still works.

24
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,010
Okay, let's out.

25
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,160
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

26
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,385
Out out out out out out.

27
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:46,870
So much for playing hide and seek.

28
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,610
Good morning guys and welcome to the vlog.

29
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,570
Oh my gosh,

30
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,850
I don't think it's appropriate for me

31
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,730
to be talking to you looking like this.

32
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:53,640
Hold that thought.

33
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,790
I'm looking for my hat,

34
00:00:56,158 --> 00:00:58,800
because I don't want to do my hair today.

35
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,280
It's not in my office.

36
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,430
My broken keyboard is though.

37
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,470
It might be in here.

38
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,750
That is a hat, that is correct,

39
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,840
but it's not my hat that I want to wear.

40
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,673
It is my hat,

41
00:01:09,673 --> 00:01:11,120
but it's not the one I want to wear.

42
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,090
Okay, again, this is a hat,

43
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,610
but it's not the hat that I want to wear.

44
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,470
Hey Jackson, do you know where my hat is?

45
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,730
- No.

46
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:19,563
- [Jared] You don't?

47
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:20,396
- No.

48
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:21,293
- [Jared] Oh.

49
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,460
- I think it's in my room.

50
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,678
- [Jared] Is it in your room?

51
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:25,511
- Yeah.

52
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:26,550
- [Jared] Okay, let's go look.

53
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,383
In here?

54
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,514
I don't see it in here.

55
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:34,110
- [Jackson] I think it's in my closet.

56
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,470
- [Jared] Okay, let's go check that.

57
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:36,603
In your closet?

58
00:01:36,603 --> 00:01:37,436
- Yeah.

59
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:38,269
- [Jared] Okay.

60
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,486
Oh my gosh, how did it get there?

61
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:44,187
- I don't know.

62
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,900
- Ah, I feel so much better now.

63
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:49,010
Now I feel like I can talk
to these guys appropriately

64
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:50,280
without being embarrassed.

65
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
- Yeah.

66
00:01:51,113 --> 00:01:52,180
- I came outside to be with Penny

67
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,440
and because I needed a
little bit of fresh air.

68
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,540
There she is, she's gonna come

69
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,929
and jump on my shoulders.

70
00:01:57,929 --> 00:01:59,166
(Penny panting)

71
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,200
(laughing)

72
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,540
Hi Penny girl.

73
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,530
What a sweet girl.

74
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:06,382
I wanted some fresh air
because my head's been hurting.

75
00:02:06,382 --> 00:02:07,759
(laughs)

76
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,459
And it's probably because of this.

77
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:11,970
Ah Penny, no!

78
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,960
Oh she got my hat.

79
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,690
Hey, I had to work hard to get that hat.

80
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,148
Come back here.

81
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:18,790
Penny Penny!

82
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,640
I lost that hat.

83
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,620
Oh jeez, arrrrr.

84
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,440
You like the smell of Daddy's head?

85
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,500
Is that what it is?

86
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,493
As I was saying,

87
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,240
I wanted to get some fresh air

88
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
because my head has been hurting

89
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,380
and I've just had a lot on my mind

90
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,910
and I wanted to talk with you a little bit

91
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,100
about what I've been thinking about.

92
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:38,410
Last night my Dad said
our whole family an email

93
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:41,970
about the story of my grandma

94
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,970
and her last year or the
last half year of her life.

95
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,590
She had severe dementia, Alzheimer's,

96
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,520
and for the last six months to a year

97
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,020
she couldn't talk, she couldn't speak,

98
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,139
move very well, let alone remember anyone.

99
00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:03,350
But my dad and her had
a couple special moments

100
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:08,350
before she passed, where
music opened her mind

101
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,404
and allowed her to remember
my dad for a minute.

102
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:14,190
And it was just such a tender story

103
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,839
and tender moment that my family

104
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,403
will remember forever.

105
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,760
It's just special moments like that

106
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,030
that stay with you for your life

107
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,560
and that story got me
thinking about vlogging

108
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,750
and why Ellie and I do what we do.

109
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,909
It made me think all the
way back to our very first

110
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,240
doctor appointment, to
the very first video

111
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,470
where I built a beauty stand for Ellie,

112
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,351
to the time we got pregnant.

113
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:41,715
Ellie!

114
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:43,440
- Oh my gosh!

115
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,952
- We're pregnant.

116
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,480
- I'm gonna be a mom.

117
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,030
- [Jared] All of these
amazing moments in our life.

118
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,757
(gentle guitar music)

119
00:03:57,382 --> 00:04:01,030
And I couldn't help but
think about the why,

120
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,450
and how important the why is in our life,

121
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,020
what we do with our life

122
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,020
and why Ellie and I are
doing this right now.

123
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,398
I want to focus on that why.

124
00:04:11,398 --> 00:04:12,350
(tender music)

125
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,900
The moments in our life, the celebrations,

126
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,769
the happiness, the down times,

127
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,869
all of those shape and create who we are

128
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,360
and the future

129
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,720
and being able to look
back on those things

130
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,000
is very special to us.

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,270
And reliving these moments

132
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:34,230
through these edits is something

133
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,570
that I will cherish forever.

134
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:41,020
And whether they're
simple or extravagant--

135
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,263
Are you ready to go on an adventure.

136
00:04:42,263 --> 00:04:43,620
- You are so weird.

137
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,633
- [Jared] The whole
limo just to ourselves.

138
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:46,466
- Hey.

139
00:04:46,466 --> 00:04:48,410
- Difficult or exciting,

140
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,410
we're creating these videos
for us to look back on,

141
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,980
to remember and to feel.

142
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,240
And maybe even teach.

143
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,000
Maybe even relate.

144
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,500
I've always told Ellie that

145
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,230
I want people to feel what we are feeling

146
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,440
when it comes to things,

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,920
when we're going through
life and these experiences.

148
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,270
And I hope that shows,

149
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,740
but that's something that
I've always tried to do.

150
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,350
And I hope that in the future

151
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,750
we can feel more,

152
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,640
to relate more and to experience more.

153
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,310
You may remember years ago,

154
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,160
we started this vlog
because we were documenting

155
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,560
our infertility journey.

156
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,640
And also because I never met my grandpa.

157
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,600
I've never heard his voice

158
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,630
and I've only heard stories about him

159
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,510
and I never wanted my
kids to experience that.

160
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,840
So we film our life so our kids,

161
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,100
our grandkids, our great grandkids,

162
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,890
maybe even that far,

163
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,920
could relive these experiences

164
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,770
that we go through.

165
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,210
That maybe we could teach them,

166
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,439
maybe we could show them things.

167
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,700
Maybe that we could make them laugh,

168
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,260
maybe they could cry with us.

169
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:03,260
And I hope that's what you
get out of this, as well.

170
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,270
Is that we go through life,

171
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,210
when it's difficult, we
can lean upon each other.

172
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,603
When it's happy, we can
laugh with each other.

173
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,890
But I want to focus on the why.

174
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,150
And I know sometimes we
do things differently.

175
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,350
Life isn't always the way we want to go,

176
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,830
but I hope that we can
experience life together

177
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,380
and go through these
ups and downs together

178
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,380
and just feel a little bit more.

179
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,520
Feel closer to each other,

180
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,490
understanding for each other,

181
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,580
and I hope you know what's in our hearts.

182
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,830
And I think that's one of
the most important things.

183
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,340
I hope when we document this

184
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,940
that you feel what's truly in our hearts,

185
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,940
because that's what we want to get across,

186
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,190
love, kindness, happiness,

187
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,542
charity, sometimes some
really bad dad jokes.

188
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:51,580
(laughs)

189
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,550
and all of that.

190
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,370
I know that this was a long rant.

191
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,810
I just hope that you feel
what I'm trying to say

192
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:00,300
and that the jumbled
words that I just said

193
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,080
make at least a little
bit of sense to you.

194
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,280
I hope we can focus on the why

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,830
we're doing what we're doing.

196
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,120
And I hope you can find
the why in your life.

197
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,150
Because if we start with why,

198
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,834
then everything else
goes out and makes sense.

199
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:19,001
(gentle guitar music)

200
00:07:31,476 --> 00:07:33,160
Do you miss the snow already?

201
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,920
I'm so grateful we don't have any

202
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,280
and you're the one who's rolling around

203
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,331
in what we have left.

204
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:39,164
(Ellie laughs)

205
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:39,997
Ah!

206
00:07:39,997 --> 00:07:41,792
- [Ellie] Penny no.

207
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:42,860
- Can I help?

208
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,589
- You gotta spray it on the right way.

209
00:07:45,589 --> 00:07:47,290
Hard woo, perfect.

210
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,721
- [Jared] Jackson, will you
show Calvin where to spray?

211
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,180
- You spray right like that.

212
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,320
- Good job.
- Perfect.

213
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,792
- [Jared] Okay Calvin your turn.

214
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:58,496
- Press it really hard on the--

215
00:07:58,496 --> 00:08:00,702
- Perfect.
- Good job.

216
00:08:00,702 --> 00:08:02,740
- [Jared] Whooooah.

217
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,890
Can you do that Calvin?

218
00:08:06,656 --> 00:08:09,500
(Jared laughs)

219
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,260
I loved going downstairs like that

220
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,093
when I was your age.

221
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,720
Alright Calvin, let's do a roll call.

222
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,570
You've got your doggie blanket, check.

223
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,120
You've got your big dog, check.

224
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,810
You've got your medium dog, check.

225
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,340
You've got your little dog, check.

226
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,278
- No, cat dog.

227
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:23,478
- [Jared] Cat dog?

228
00:08:23,478 --> 00:08:24,311
- Yeah.

229
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,990
- [Jared] Do you even
know what cat dog is?

230
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,823
- Yeah.

231
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:27,656
- That's a major throwback.

232
00:08:27,656 --> 00:08:29,567
That was a show when I was a kid.

233
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,020
♪ Alone in the world
with a little CatDog. ♪

234
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,481
What book are we reading tonight Jackson?

235
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,313
- This!

236
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,924
- I know, One Fish, Two Fish,

237
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,322
Red Fish and Blue Fish.

238
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:40,489
- [Jared] Yes, let's read this book.

239
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,419
- No, red fish.

240
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,519
- [Jared] Red fish.

241
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,113
Oh almost forgot, one last dog.

242
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,863
There you go.

243
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:49,470
Black fish, blue fish,

244
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,080
old fish, new fish.

245
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,700
This one has a little star,

246
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,187
this one has a little car.

247
00:08:55,187 --> 00:08:57,659
- No this blue star.

248
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:59,082
- That is a star.

249
00:08:59,082 --> 00:08:59,915
- No, blue star.

250
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:01,100
- It's a blue star, that's right.

251
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,546
Hi boys.

252
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:03,490
- Hi.
- Look at this.

253
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,223
- That's your check.

254
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:06,230
- It's my cheek.

255
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,480
- Yeah, that's your cheek.

256
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,170
Do you boys know that your mom and I

257
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,570
are so lucky to have you in our life?

258
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,120
- When we were a baby?

259
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,030
- And even now too.

260
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,970
Did you know that there was a time

261
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,170
that we were married

262
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:21,610
and we didn't have you?

263
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,443
- Yeah.

264
00:09:22,443 --> 00:09:25,090
- Yeah, it was just me and Mommy

265
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,420
and we wanted you boys so bad

266
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,570
and we're so lucky to
have you in our life.

267
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,823
Do you want to know something?

268
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,656
- Yeah.

269
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,762
- You make us smile.

270
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:35,595
- Yeah.

271
00:09:35,595 --> 00:09:37,255
- You make us laugh.

272
00:09:37,255 --> 00:09:39,100
And we love you so much.

273
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,550
- How did you didn't have me?

274
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,810
- Well before you were born,

275
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,693
it was just me and Mommy.

276
00:09:44,693 --> 00:09:45,526
- How?

277
00:09:45,526 --> 00:09:47,225
(music ends)

278
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,608
- That's just the way it was.
(gentle guitar music)

279
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:50,380
(laughs)

280
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,440
We'll get into that when you're older.

281
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,410
And before me and Mommy fell in love

282
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,480
and got married, it was just me.

283
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,395
- Yeah.

284
00:09:57,395 --> 00:09:58,630
- And I was with my family,

285
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,830
my brothers and sisters
just like you have Calvin.

286
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,983
- When you got married, was it only you?

287
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,943
- When I got married, it was me and Mommy.

288
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,960
- What happened when it was only you?

289
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,370
- I lived with my family,

290
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,220
with Grandma and Grandpa Mecham.

291
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,530
And Uncle Ryan, and
Uncle Nate and Aunt Mel

292
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,550
and Uncle Matt and Aunt Jennifer.

293
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,964
Do you miss your cousins?

294
00:10:20,964 --> 00:10:21,797
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

295
00:10:21,797 --> 00:10:23,466
- Can you say hi to all you cousins?

296
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:25,697
- Hi stinky cousins.

297
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:26,530
(laughing)

298
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,590
- Hey, we had a good day today, didn't we?

299
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:29,423
- Yeah.
- Yep.

300
00:10:29,423 --> 00:10:30,970
- We played hide and seek.

301
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,800
We took Penny on a walk

302
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,280
and we played with our bikes and scooters.

303
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,523
It was a good day today.

304
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:37,356
- And the Hoverboard.

305
00:10:37,356 --> 00:10:38,189
- And the Hoverboard.

306
00:10:38,189 --> 00:10:39,150
It was a great day

307
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,630
and I can't wait until tomorrow

308
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,746
when we do another great
day just like that.

309
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:44,679
Can you say goodbye to our friends?

310
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,307
- Bye friends.
- Goodbye friends.

311
00:10:46,307 --> 00:10:48,718
- Bye friends, goodnight guys.

312
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:50,530
- Goodnight guys.
- Night guys.

313
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,860
- Before we end the vlog today,

314
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,630
I wanted to give you guys a reminder.

315
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,310

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,130
to the Bollie Instagram.

319
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,950

320
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:04,690

Thank you guys so much for watching.

325
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:13,050
The Start With Why,

326
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:15,820
that is a book that I've
read that's by Simon Sinek,

327
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,270
it's related to business,

328
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,840
but it's also very related
to personal things too.

329
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,100
Why you start something.

330
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,910
And it means a lot to me.

331
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,290
So that's kinda the message

332
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,670
that I wanted to bring is, start with why.

333
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,470
And that's what we're going to try and do,

334
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,290
so thank you guys for watching.

335
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,123
If you enjoyed the video,

336
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:35,020
give it a big thumbs up.

337
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,400
It was kind of a different one today,

338
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,670
but thank you guys,
we'll see you next time.

339
00:11:38,670 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
