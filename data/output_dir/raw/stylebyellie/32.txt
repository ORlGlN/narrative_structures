1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,012
- It does not matter,

2
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:02,190
Jared, you're not coaching anymore.

3
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,070
Put this away.

4
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,100
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness,
Jackson has got it.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:09,890
Oh no, and we told ya to leave the kids.

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,700
Thanks for breakfast Jared.

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,300
- You're welcome, sweet wife.

8
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,640
- Thanks for doing the dishes.

9
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,079
- You're welcome, sweet wife.

10
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,530
- Thanks for tolerating me

11
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,744
even though I have crazy,
freaky pregnancy dreams.

12
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:24,300
- Your pregnancy dreams
are out of this world!

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,940
- I have gone through 8,000 photos

14
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:31,160
that I have organized into
Jackson, Calvin, Christmas,

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,570
house, Penny, all of these folders

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,560
and now I'm importing
4,000 more to go through.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,640
Holy cow, that's what
you get when you never

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,090
organize your photos in 10 years, so.

19
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:43,530
- Ellie, I'm sorry to
say we're not even close.

20
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,290
We still have four more hard
drives to go through too.

21
00:00:47,262 --> 00:00:49,845
(bright music)

22
00:00:54,646 --> 00:00:56,086
- This is our trap.

23
00:00:56,086 --> 00:00:57,151
- [Ellie] For what?

24
00:00:57,151 --> 00:00:58,240
- For that.

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,720
- [Ellie] For the robot, kay.

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,710
- Hello and welcome to my closet.

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,520
A couple days ago,
Ellie told you about how

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,370
she went through some bins

29
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,970
or maybe she didn't, I can't remember.

30
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,750
Anyway, we've had some
bins in the storage room

31
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,000
and we've kinda wanted
to consolidate them down

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,460
to smaller containers,

33
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,445
get rid of things that
we don't want anymore,

34
00:01:15,445 --> 00:01:18,410
just unnecessary things
that are taking up space

35
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,758
and this bin right here,

36
00:01:19,758 --> 00:01:20,860
(groans)

37
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,730
it's 50 pounds, is my bin.

38
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,960
And there's some things in it

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,560
and I want to go over a
couple of those things,

40
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,440
just to reminisce and go
down memory lane with you.

41
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,870
The first thing that I see here,

42
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:37,040
this backpack, is like my
favorite backpack of all time.

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,084
It's a HaglÃ¶fs backpack.

44
00:01:38,084 --> 00:01:39,740
I think they make them in Sweden,

45
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,870
but I got this when I lived in Finland.

46
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,350
I'm gonna keep this backpack forever,

47
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:46,000
because it reminds me
of living in Finland.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,790
I think one of these days I'll go over

49
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,440
my stay in Finland more,

50
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,030
and more specifically about my feelings

51
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,950
about Finland and coming
home from Finland.

52
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,410
But there's one thing in particular

53
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:00,480
that I wanted to show you that's
really kinda special to me

54
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,150
that you guys don't know a ton about.

55
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,020
It's before Ellie and I were married.

56
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,940
I was huge into pole vaulting.

57
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,220
Pole vaulting was my
favorite sport of all time.

58
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,400
I started doing pole
vaulting about half way

59
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,780
through high school and I actually went

60
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,070
to college for pole vaulting

61
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,580
and then all of my hip
injuries caught up with me.

62
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:17,280
And then, after I couldn't compete,

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,290
I actually started
coaching the women's team

64
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,240
at the college I went to.

65
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,680
And during that time,

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,480
I wrote a technical manual
on the best technique

67
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,060
you can do to pole vaulting

68
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,570
and why the other techniques
aren't as good as this.

69
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,560
We call it the 640 model or 21 feet.

70
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,350
Using this technical model,

71
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,430
we believe that you can pole vault 21 feet

72
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,290
and the world record
right now is 6.15 meters,

73
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,510
which is almost 20 feet, two inches.

74
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:47,010
So Sergey Bubka in my opinion

75
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,470
is the greatest pole vaulter in the world.

76
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:52,260
Using this model, he could
have pole vaulted 21 feet.

77
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,807
And I wrote a manual on it.

78
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:57,370
(laughs)

79
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,203
Isn't that crazy?

80
00:02:58,203 --> 00:02:59,440
And I was going to published,

81
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
like I was going to have this published,

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,500
but I just, I never did.

83
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
But this is my manual,

84
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,200
it's really special to me too.

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,610
Let's see what else we've got in here.

86
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,790
Well this is a throw back,

87
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:12,340
this is a 360 camera for the iPhone 4.

88
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,620
My brother Nate got this
for me for Christmas.

89
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,760
See and just things like this.

90
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,870
These are just the iPhone 5s boxes

91
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,720
that Ellie and I got a long time ago.

92
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,800
These are in here, so we don't need

93
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,570
to keep these anymore, but
we've had them for awhile.

94
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,960
I usually keep all the stickers

95
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,930
and stuff in there, so let's
see if those are in here.

96
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,070
I talked about that in my
HomePod unboxing video.

97
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,699
Yep, here they are.

98
00:03:33,699 --> 00:03:35,240
(laughs)

99
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,870
Who keeps a laptop box?

100
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:37,703
Right?

101
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:38,980
Who keeps an iPad box?

102
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,050
I don't know, I guess I do.

103
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,650
Do you keep a lot of these things

104
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,610
when you get stuff?

105
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,230
Oh my gosh, here's a portable charger.

106
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,130
I should probably actually use this.

107
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,770
Here we go.

108
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,762
Suomi, Englanti, Suomi.

109
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,595
(Ellie laughs)

110
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:51,561
I'm going though some of my stuff.

111
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:52,394
Hey,

112
00:03:52,394 --> 00:03:53,227
- [Ellie] Hey.

113
00:03:53,227 --> 00:03:54,923
- let's learn a Finnish word together.

114
00:03:54,923 --> 00:03:55,756
- Okay.

115
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:56,670
(speaking in foreign language)

116
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,610
What's a word that you
want to learn in Finnish?

117
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,443
- [Ellie] Puppy.

118
00:03:59,443 --> 00:04:00,276
- Puppy?

119
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:01,109
- [Ellie] Or dog.

120
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,390
- Okay, I know dog, let's learn puppy.

121
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,296
Dog in Finnish is koira.

122
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:05,270
(barking)

123
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,734
Puppy, koiran.

124
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:08,567
(Ellie laughs)

125
00:04:08,567 --> 00:04:09,400
So it's like the--

126
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,233
- Koiran.

127
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,566
- It's like the koiran.
- Koiran.

128
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:12,399
- Or pentu.

129
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,320
- [Ellie] I'm gonna call Penny koiran.

130
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,490
- Nulkki, nulikka, something like that.

131
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,550
I just wanted to show a
couple things in here.

132
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,620
Just go down memory lane real quick.

133
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,290
I wanted to show this 640
technical pole vaulting manual,

134
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,170
because it's not something
that you guys know

135
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,950
about me very well is my athletic history.

136
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,650
Controlled run up, free pole drop,

137
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,350
early controlled plant, last three steps,

138
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,160
free take off, the free
take off is very important.

139
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,130
Solid position and take off and inversion

140
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,963
and that's the other thing

141
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,320
is the inversion phase is just something

142
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,870
that people don't really
take into consideration

143
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,940
when they're pole vaulting.

144
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,230
Obviously they're thinking about it,

145
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,120
but it's about the
execution of the inversion.

146
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,880
You don't know, it doesn't matter.

147
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,713
It does not matter.

148
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:49,940
Jared you're not coaching anymore.

149
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,820
Put this away.

150
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,870
I hope you enjoyed going
down memory lane with me.

151
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,410
- If Jackson wants to do something,

152
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,570
he figures out a way to get it done.

153
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,200
He put on his shoes, socks, hat and coat

154
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,076
and he said I want to play with a friend,

155
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:03,408
can I go over to so and so's house.

156
00:05:03,408 --> 00:05:05,230
And I was like, get on your bike,

157
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,730
I watched him through the window

158
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,070
ride to his friends

159
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,510
and he's not riding his
bike home with his friend,

160
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,540
he's walking his bike
home with his friend,

161
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,920
because his friend didn't have a bike.

162
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,430
Okay, see ya in a minute.

163
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,187
(laughing)

164
00:05:17,187 --> 00:05:19,074
- And they all go down there ah!

165
00:05:19,074 --> 00:05:21,324
(laughing)

166
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,496
Did our parents ever feel like that?

167
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,329
When we did stuff like that?

168
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,369
- [Ellie] Oh I'm sure.

169
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,390
- Ah!

170
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,870
- But that was so, funny and sweet

171
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,570
seeing him not just ride his bike,

172
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,860
he walked it next to his friend.

173
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,810
That's cute.

174
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,380
So is Chase and Marshall
over there kissin'.

175
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,380
So cute.

176
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,947
- Chase is on the case.

177
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:40,790
(howling)

178
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,360
- I think her face is
hilarious when she scratches.

179
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,280
Her smile is so cute when she does that.

180
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,190
- You should see your face

181
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,290
when I give you a back massage.

182
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,880
- So tonight, Emily and Beau invited

183
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,430
the whole family over, no kids allowed,

184
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,990
to a little fondue party.

185
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,110
And we just happen to have a fondue pot.

186
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,540
So thank you Jared.

187
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,750
He went and grabbed a
ton of veggies to steam.

188
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,010
When we go tot he Melting
Pot that does fondue,

189
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,240
they never steam the veggies,

190
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
it's just raw veggies

191
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,250
and it really isn't that great,

192
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,420
so I think it'll be really
good to steam those.

193
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,730
- I never realized,

194
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,220
we buy one type of
cheese, cheddar cheese--

195
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,650
- [Ellie] And it's like three bucks.

196
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,850
- Yeah and we bought this
other kind of cheese--

197
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:21,106
- [Ellie] Are you scratching my back?

198
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,156
- No, back massaging.

199
00:06:24,554 --> 00:06:27,310
- Oh thanks, what are you using?

200
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,220
Perfect, keep rubbing my back,

201
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,320
that's a good boy.

202
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,910
- But I got this other kind of cheese

203
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,970
that is made for, not made for,

204
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,220
but it's good fondue
cheese and I was like oh.

205
00:06:40,243 --> 00:06:41,835
- [Ellie] Expensive.

206
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:43,520
Yahoo, it's gonna be a good dinner.

207
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,630
- I'm excited, it's gonna be fun.

208
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,270
We've got dessert, we've got dinner

209
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,820
and we've got cheese.

210
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,653
- [Ellie] Hi Pen.

211
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:49,790
- Sorry Penny, you're not invited.

212
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,190
- [Ellie] And neither
are you, neither are you,

213
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,230
but you guys are excited
to have your sitter

214
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,160
come over, huh?

215
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,900
- [Jared] Yeah boy.

216
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,550
- [Ellie] Oh my good grief.

217
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,770
- [Jared] Just stuff it all in there, bud.

218
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,990
- [Ellie] Good grief.

219
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,540
- [Jared] Like a turkey on Thanksgiving.

220
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,970
- [Ellie] No you don't eat anymore.

221
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,140
Let's get some food in ya.

222
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,670
- This is how we heat the fondue pot,

223
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,540
but it's all the way up there

224
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,900
and I don't want to climb up there.

225
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,266
So I'm gonna have you do it.

226
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:12,170
(Ellie laughs)

227
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,950
- [Ellie] The duty that
all the kids have to do.

228
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,028
- This?
- Yep.

229
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:16,234
- [Jared] That thing, grab that thing.

230
00:07:16,234 --> 00:07:18,230
Good job bud.
- Perfect.

231
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,543
- Thanks.

232
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,890
- [Ellie] You know what,
Beau used to always put me

233
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,210
on top of the fridgerator at home

234
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,760
and I would just have to sit there

235
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,430
and I was too scared to jump down.

236
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,634
So I'd just sit there
for a minute, scream.

237
00:07:28,634 --> 00:07:30,980
- My dad would have me
climb under his desk

238
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,649
and do all of his computer cords.

239
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,482
- [Ellie] Oh.

240
00:07:33,482 --> 00:07:34,315
- His legs went down

241
00:07:34,315 --> 00:07:35,930
and then there was an underneath,

242
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,010
that part that I had to go under.

243
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:38,843
- [Ellie] Yeah.

244
00:07:38,843 --> 00:07:40,700
- So, I felt like I was Mission
Impossible all the time.

245
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,533
- [Ellie] That's fun.

246
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,366
It's fun to help out.

247
00:07:42,366 --> 00:07:44,540
Do you like to help Daddy out?

248
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,810
It kinda gives kids a little

249
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,027
something to do and satisfaction.

250
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:48,980
- Look at her.

251
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,550
- [Ellie] Penny, doesn't she look dainty

252
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,650
with her little chewing thing?

253
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,980
Much better than Calvin's toy, huh Penny?

254
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,720
We have to take Calvin's
toys away from you

255
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,778
A few times a day.

256
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:02,394
(playful music)

257
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,870
Good luck getting it from her.

258
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,770
I don't think she is going to give up.

259
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,110
(Ellie laughs)

260
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,320
Once she has that,

261
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,422
there's no one getting it from her.

262
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:13,874
- Waa!

263
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:16,124
(laughing)

264
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,670
- [Ellie] She'll tdrop the kids' toys,

265
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,503
but not her own.

266
00:08:20,503 --> 00:08:21,336
- Not hers, no way.

267
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:22,681
- [Ellie] No way.

268
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,343
- And that's something.

269
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:26,065
- Did you get it?
- Oh no, pull on it.

270
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:26,898
- [Jared] You had it.

271
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:27,731
- [Ellie] Hey she was pretty good

272
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:29,540
to let you at least grab it.

273
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,670
Did you get it?

274
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,653
Did you get it?

275
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,549
You got it!

276
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,729
Awww.

277
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,880
Oh my goodness, Jackson got it.

278
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,440
Jackson!

279
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,059
Okay, throw it.

280
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:40,909
Oh well (laughs).

281
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,760
That was crazy.

282
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,400
- I want to do it again.

283
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,860
- [Ellie] Well we'll see, I don't know.

284
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,680
Oh my word.

285
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,570
Throw it Cal, throw it.

286
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,880
How Calvin got it, I don't know.

287
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,040
Okay Penny, come here.

288
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,811
Throw it for Penny.

289
00:08:56,811 --> 00:08:58,150
Woo!

290
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,000
Good girl.

291
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,850
Oh she just wants to go see Dad.

292
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,630
So you dropped it willingly.

293
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,570
He's putting stuff in the car.

294
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:07,160
She is always so concerned

295
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,400
if Jared goes out of the house.

296
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,870
She stops what she's doing

297
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,300
And she will stare at the door

298
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,400
until he comes back.

299
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,150
So she'll just sit here forever

300
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,520
until Jared comes back.

301
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,555
Do do do do do do do do.

302
00:09:20,555 --> 00:09:21,642
Do do do do.

303
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:24,180
- Hi, did you miss me?

304
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,220
- [Ellie] For two seconds.

305
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,890
- Ready ready sit, down.

306
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,765
Good girl, okay now soft,

307
00:09:29,765 --> 00:09:31,140
so so so soft.

308
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,827
Soft, that wasn't soft enough.

309
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:36,171
That wasn't soft enough.

310
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,258
(Ellie laughs)

311
00:09:37,258 --> 00:09:39,240
Soft, good girl.

312
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,330
That's a good girl.

313
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,140
- [Ellie] Did your dogs ever grab softly?

314
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,170
- Oh Wrinkles did, Annie didn't.

315
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,515
- I'm trying to think of our dog.

316
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:48,660
I think I remember me giving her steak

317
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,670
and being nervous,

318
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,350
because she would grab a little too tight.

319
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,240
I am very happy with
Penny and her softness.

320
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,600
Now look, Penny's been hyper and playing,

321
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,190
so you have to hold it like this

322
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:02,520
and really remind her to be soft.

323
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,309
So say Penny come.

324
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,460
- Penny come.

325
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,845
- [Ellie] Penny, do you want a treat?

326
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:08,678
Sit.

327
00:10:08,678 --> 00:10:11,070
- [Jared] Sit, just one time say sit.

328
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:11,903
- Sit.

329
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,010
- [Ellie] Now say soft, soft, soft.

330
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,970
- [Jared] Go very slowly and say soft.

331
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,143
- [Ellie] Soft.

332
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,330
- [Jackson] Soft.

333
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,210
- [Jared] Good job.

334
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,860
- [Ellie] Gotta be so so so soft.

335
00:10:22,763 --> 00:10:23,789
- Come.

336
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,481
Okay, soft.

337
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:26,635
- Soft.

338
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,773
- Soft.

339
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:28,606
Oh soft.

340
00:10:29,534 --> 00:10:30,924
- Soft.

341
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:32,062
- Good girl.

342
00:10:32,062 --> 00:10:33,225
- [Jackson] I want to do it.

343
00:10:33,225 --> 00:10:34,462
- [Ellie] Do you want to do one more?

344
00:10:34,462 --> 00:10:35,295
- Yeah.

345
00:10:35,295 --> 00:10:36,128
- [Ellie] Okay, last one.

346
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,026
Leave it there and she'll
grab it out of your hand.

347
00:10:39,026 --> 00:10:40,443
- [Jackson] Soft.

348
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,780
- Good.
- Yay!

349
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,160
- I'm going to go pick up the sitter

350
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,830
in just a minute.

351
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,680
So I grabbed the kids' clothes,

352
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,220
their bath clothes with
a little bath bomb.

353
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,660
I'm putting it in my bathroom

354
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,230
for them to get ready
for bed with the sitter.

355
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,220
I don't always do this
when we have babysitters,

356
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,710
but sometimes, depending
on how the kids are,

357
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,070
or depending on how the sitters are here,

358
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,040
what I want the babysitters to do,

359
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,960
I will just pre-make stuff for dinners,

360
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,790
so I made peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches

361
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,690
and I was like, they can eat that,

362
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,610
then they can have a snack,
apples, strawberries,

363
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,170
whatever, before bed,
so that is for the kids.

364
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,970
We're gonna say goodbye
to Penny for a little bit.

365
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,413
And I'm gonna go get her.

366
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:23,940
- Okay.

367
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,210
- [Ellie] You know it's
gonna be a good relaxing date

368
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,230
when you walk out of the
house with your slippers.

369
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,270
- Yeah baby.

370
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,850
- [Ellie] Walking out of my
house into someone else's house.

371
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,400
- I tell ya, my wife, business up top,

372
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,610

373
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,364
- I never get to go in
the gas station with you,

374
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,197
because I'm always with the kids.

375
00:11:39,197 --> 00:11:40,030
- Yeah, you always have the kids.

376
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,970
We have a long drive ahead of us,

377
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,130
so we gotta fuel up the car,

378
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,350
we gotta fuel up our bodies.

379
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,260
No kids, wanna party?

380
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,860
- I've been drinking water all day,

381
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,010
so I'm gonna be really
good and not get a pop.

382
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,310
- Okay, I'm not.

383
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,880
Ellie I will not let you try and open this

384
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,550

385
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,150

386
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,280
You've been working so hard to keep those

387
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,330
ship-shape.
- Thank you.

388
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,130
- I will not let you break a nail,

389
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,664
while I try and struggle.

390
00:12:04,664 --> 00:12:06,060
I can't do it!

391
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,730
Here, you do it for me.

392
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,768
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
- I got it all.

393
00:12:09,768 --> 00:12:12,935
(gentle guitar music)

394
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,350
- [Ellie] It is clean,
thank you Beau Beau.

395
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:22,280
It looks amazing, thank you Emily.

396
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,615
This is so fun.

397
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:26,560
Well that's nice, I'm starving.

398
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,440
Hi baby, hi baby.

399
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,273

00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:31,110
- [Ellie] Hi baby.

401
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,890
Why did you come to the
party looking like crap?

402
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,830
- [Jared] Did you poop on your--

403
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,773

404
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:40,820
- [Ellie] Oh no, and we
told you to leave the kids.

405
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,653
I'm sorry.

406
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:43,359
- That seriously looks crappy.

407
00:12:43,359 --> 00:12:44,709
- [Ellie] I like her shirt.

408
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,160
- [Jared] Oh I pulled out the camera.

409
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,493
(laughing)

410
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,740
Everyone say vasectomy.

411
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,130
Two people in this room have
had a vasectomy, guess who?

412
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,963
(laughing)

413
00:12:59,963 --> 00:13:02,850
