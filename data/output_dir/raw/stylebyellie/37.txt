1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,640
- I'm so baby hungry.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,218
He has more shoes than I do.

3
00:00:03,218 --> 00:00:05,050
(mumbling)

4
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,660
- It's just, I just don't enjoy it.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,810
And I don't do it very often.

6
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:09,643
Good morning, guys.

7
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:12,440
A couple days ago I said just
because today is terrible

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,990
doesn't mean that tomorrow
isn't going to be great.

9
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,460
Well, today is going to be terrible.

10
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,910
It's terrible, Ellie.

11
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,400
We have to go to the dentist
today and get a lot, a lot,

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,390
a lot of work done.
- All for eating

13
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,300
crap every night.

14
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,360
- It's true, but-

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,101
- Worth it.

16
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:29,220
- Hashtag worth it.

17
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,560
Hashtag also I'm eating
a salad for lunch today.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,570
So hashtag making improvements.

19
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,730
- Hashtag Jared's gone to
the gym this week with Joel.

20
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,563
- You know that's right.

21
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:38,430
Good morning, buddies.

22
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,732
What are you guys doing today?

23
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:40,750
- Drawing.

24
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,900
- [Jared] Drawing?

25
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,260
Calvin, are you coloring?

26
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,093
- No.

27
00:00:44,093 --> 00:00:44,926
This one.

28
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:45,970
- [Jared] Oh, you're coloring that one?

29
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:46,803
Good.

30
00:00:46,803 --> 00:00:48,050
- I'm doing letters.

31
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,883
- [Jared] Yeah.

32
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:49,716
How are you feeling, Jackson?

33
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,813
You feeling a little better?

34
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:51,646
- No.

35
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:52,479
- No.

36
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,312
- [Jared] No?

37
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,145
Your throat still hurts a little bit?

38
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,040
- Yeah.

39
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,730
- Yeah, I'm sorry bud.

40
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,810
I do think Jackson is on the mend.

41
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,600
He did sleep a lot better last
night than the night before.

42
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,890
So all things considered, even though

43
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,740
we're going to have a
terrible day at the dentist,

44
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,300
Jackson's getting a little bit better.

45
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,440
So that's a thumbs up.

46
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,273
See?

47
00:01:10,273 --> 00:01:12,770
It does get better.

48
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,650
- [Ellie] Okay, ready to eat Mr. McGoo?

49
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,555
Ready to eat?

50
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:16,388
- Yeah.

51
00:01:16,388 --> 00:01:17,770
- Are you kidding me right now?

52
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,140
Are you kidding me?

53
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,630
It's starting to snow.

54
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,710
Oh my goodness.

55
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,970
Do you see those little flakes?

56
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,270
- I'm not even going to complain.

57
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,540
Do you remember last year when
we couldn't get the fence?

58
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,373
- [Jared] That's true.

59
00:01:28,373 --> 00:01:29,740
- I think we annoyed everyone so much.

60
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,010
We couldn't get the fence
'til like, was it April?

61
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,660
It was like snow and frozen.

62
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,850
Just a flurry.

63
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,683
- [Jared] Yeah.

64
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:37,800
What are you guys doing, daydreaming?

65
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,633
- Yeah.

66
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:39,466
Do you want to see what we're looking at?

67
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:40,299
- [Jared] Yeah.

68
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,160
What were you ladies looking at?

69
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,270
Patio furniture.

70
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,920
- We're looking at patio
furniture and rugs.

71
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,440
Do you like that rug?

72
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,273
- [Jared] That's pretty nice.

73
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,106
- Like that rug?

74
00:01:48,106 --> 00:01:49,240
Like that rug?

75
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,073
Dig all of them?

76
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:50,906
- Yeah, I do.

77
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:53,914
You can daydream about that all day long.

78
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:54,840
- And this.

79
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,040
The egg chairs.
- [Jared] Ooh, yeah.

80
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,873
That looks good.

81
00:01:56,873 --> 00:01:58,560
You can daydream about that all day long

82
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,230
so long as I can daydream about my Tesla.

83
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,063
Okay?

84
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,137
Ouch.

85
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:04,373
Ouch.

86
00:02:04,373 --> 00:02:06,090
I'm just gonna back away slowly

87
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:08,509
and assume that everything's
gonna work out okay.

88
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,550
I may run into another bar
stool, but I'm backing up.

89
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,383
Gosh dang it.

90
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,220
Are you ready for this?

91
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,500
I don't have a fear of the
dentist, I just don't like

92
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,070
getting fillings.
- You have your wallet?

93
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:18,903
- Yeah, I've got

94
00:02:18,903 --> 00:02:19,736
my wallet.
- You'll pay for me?

95
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,030
- I'll buy your fillings, too.

96
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,890
How many do you have?

97
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,410
- I'm not telling you.

98
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,050
- You have just as many as I do.

99
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,080
I think you do.

100
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,700
It's just, I just don't enjoy it.

101
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,940
And I don't do it very often.

102
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,030
- No one enjoys getting
their mouth prodded.

103
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,863
Let's go.

104
00:02:33,863 --> 00:02:36,280
Do you think they'll let me
sleep when I get it done?

105
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,170
I'll just lay like this.

106
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,980
- This is our Valentine's date by the way.

107
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,950
- Happy Valentine's Day.

108
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,625
We're at the dentist and
you're getting fillings.

109
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:44,000
That's my gift to you.

110
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,833
- Thank you.

111
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:45,666
- And we'll come back and do more later.

112
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:46,499
- Okay.

113
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,450
- [Narrator] Two hours later.

114
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,283
- Smile.

115
00:02:49,283 --> 00:02:50,360
- Smile.

116
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,880
Gosh dang it, my lips.

117
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,713
This one side-

118
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:53,910
- I feel like you're overdoing that a lot.

119
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,186
- I am not overdoing it.

120
00:02:55,186 --> 00:02:56,140
Listen, like-

121
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,670
- No, really.

122
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:58,503
- Listen.

123
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:01,610
Like I'm doing the best I can.

124
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,610
I'm serious.

125
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,060
- Okay, do this.

126
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,110
Try to rub your lips.

127
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,730
- Did you see that right there?

128
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,590
- You did pretty good.

129
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,590
- So here's the thing.

130
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,870
- Mine are hard to rub.
- Gosh dang it.

131
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,280
Here's the situation.

132
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,960
I'm not joking in the slightest.

133
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,056
I'm trying to talk as best I can.

134
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,730
- [Ellie] I feel like you're exaggerating.

135
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,563
- I swear.

136
00:03:19,563 --> 00:03:21,280
(laughter)

137
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,330
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

138
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,036
This is joking.

139
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,560
(mumbling)

140
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,460
I'm being as serious as I possibly can.

141
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,340
Like I'm not trying to joke
around with how I'm talking.

142
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,550
The S's are hard.

143
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,550
So I had four cavities.

144
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,780
Okay, I had four cavities
and Ellie did too.

145
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,380
Don't even think you can hide it.

146
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,213
It's the truth.

147
00:03:40,213 --> 00:03:41,046
You did.

148
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,900
But Ellie and I both
opted not to get numbing

149
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,950
on three out of the four cavities.

150
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,277
So I had one here, here,
and I only got numb here.

151
00:03:49,277 --> 00:03:50,390
- [Ellie] Good job.

152
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,223
- And you did too.

153
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:53,400
That's what they told me is
you only got one numb shot.

154
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,720
Cause we're tough.

155
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,553
- Okay, guys.

156
00:03:55,553 --> 00:03:59,540
I have a huge baby haul that
I want to share with you guys.

157
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,530
If my smile's crooked
it's cause of the dentist.

158
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:03,935
But I have a haul and
I just want to show you

159
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:07,100
some of the items that I've
pulled out for the baby.

160
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,380
This is probably the
biggest haul I'm gonna have.

161
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,440
Maybe I'll have a few more
items that I'll talk about

162
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,520
before baby comes, but like this is like

163
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,332
everything that I've got and
I'm so excited to show you.

164
00:04:16,332 --> 00:04:19,410
If you look over here we
raised the crib the other day

165
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,829
and my mom made this blanket for,

166
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,340
she started with the
oldest and ended with me

167
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,560
and so now this is gonna be
in my little baby boy's crib.

168
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,220
I have his little blanket right here.

169
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,250
And for all of my boys they have had

170
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,570
the infant Minky blankets and then now

171
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,420
they're four and three
and I just got them like

172
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,100
a bigger sized blanket from Minky.

173
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,734
I've bought like four or five
Minky blankets over the years

174
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:44,580
and this baby is no different.

175
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,560
This is his blanket that I
picked out specifically for him.

176
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,450
And then I got one right
here for the rocking chair.

177
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,710
And I just think the color is beautiful

178
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,810
to go with the chair.

179
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,220
I spend a lot of time here.

180
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,580
A lot of crying from me and the baby,

181
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,450
a lot of sleeping for me and the baby,

182
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,070
and a lot of throw up from the baby

183
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,560
just happens in the rocking chair

184
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,370
and like long nights are spent here.

185
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,560
So I'm excited to have some cozy blankets.

186
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,760
And then I have the cutest clothes.

187
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,000
I cannot wait to put
Jackson and Calvin in these.

188
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,470
I'm really hoping that the boys

189
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,970
will grow a hair so
they'll fit into these.

190
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:20,600
I got these from Sugar
Babies I found online.

191
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,300
And moms have made these clothes.

192
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,040
Like look how cute and perfect
that is for a newborn body.

193
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,140
Like that is gonna be so sweet
and tender on my little guy.

194
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,580
I wish I had a name for you.

195
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,830
We just call him baby M.

196
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,820
So I have those.

197
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,160
From Sugar Babies also I got this

198
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,920
little outfit and this
little sweat outfit.

199
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,990
It's gonna be pretty warm
when we bring him home.

200
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,293
But when we're in the
house and the AC is going

201
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:47,600
they like to be cozied up,
so I have this for them.

202
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,410
And then I actually got something

203
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,820
for me and Jackson and Calvin.

204
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,860
I thought these were just
the cutest hats ever.

205
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,180
So I have a momma hat.

206
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,110
Jackson has a little stud hat.

207
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:59,640
And Calvin has a momma's boy hat.

208
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,390
I think that fits them so perfectly,

209
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,730
so I just got that for us for the summer.

210
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,590
And then my favorite bottles
that I used for Calvin

211
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,380
when I transitioned from breastfeeding

212
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:11,940
to bottle feeding was
the Comotomo bottles.

213
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,540
And I got these also from
the Sugar Babies site.

214
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,720
And I got two of them.

215
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,100
I plan on nursing, but I also would like

216
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,970
to have these on hand
if I try and not nurse

217
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:24,180
or when that time comes
when I switch if I do.

218
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,250
With all of my babies I have wanted

219
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,520
like a baby bath of some sort.

220
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,261
We have the coolest, biggest
farm sink in the kitchen

221
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:35,640
and so I thought this was perfect.

222
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,620
You put this in the sink.

223
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,190
It's a Blooming Baby bath.

224
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,810
And it's just more cozy
for the baby to lay on.

225
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,100
So I thought this would be
really fun for the baby.

226
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,280
I didn't even show you.

227
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,113
What do you think?

228
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:45,946
- [Jared] I like it a lot.

229
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:46,779
It looks really cool.

230
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,910
- I have a bunch of little baby toys

231
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,960
that I need to get in the room.

232
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,330
The is a teething toy
that I bought for him,

233
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,990
but he's gonna use a lot
of like the other baby toys

234
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,700
that Jackson and Calvin had I
need to bring up in the room.

235
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,480
One of the things that I really
wanted to get for the baby

236
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,493
is a bassinet and I also really

237
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:06,340
have been wanting one of these.

238
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,500
It's DockATot.

239
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,150
I got this from the Sugar
Babies site as well.

240
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,700
I kind of went ham on there.

241
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,180
And I didn't know quite
what I was expecting.

242
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,600
I didn't realize that
this was gonna be so firm.

243
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,490
This is for ages zero to eight months.

244
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,050
It's a breathable material.

245
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,090
It's like a portable, lightweight.

246
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,960
The baby can do tummy time on here.

247
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,530
He can do play time on here.

248
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,190
I thought this would just be perfect

249
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,270
because when we're together
a lot with the family

250
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,630
we're on my bed, we're on the
couch, we're watching shows.

251
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,000
I just thought that this would be nice

252
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,990
to like have the baby
have his own little space.

253
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,180
So if the baby's on the
floor it's not just like

254
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,420
the baby and then the kids or something.

255
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,600
He at least has something to like kind of

256
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
sit in for us to watch him in.

257
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,050
So I am really excited for that.

258
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you guys ready to see his closet?

259
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,490
He has more shoes than I do.

260
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,820
Baby M has more shoes than momma does.

261
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,650
This is his closet.

262
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,233
(upbeat music)

263
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,840
I'm just starting to put stuff in here.

264
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
This is his closet.

265
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,900
The first thing I have in
here is actually for me.

266
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,733
Mom of boys.

267
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,130
I got this from Etsy.

268
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,750
I just thought that this
would be really cute

269
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,220
and I haven't put it in my room yet.

270
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,810
But with all of my babies I have not

271
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,090
purchased these dividers.

272
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:17,270
Zero to three months,
three to six, six to nine.

273
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,180
It goes on and up.

274
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,340
I've never purchased these because

275
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,770
I've never felt like I needed them,

276
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,060
but with him he has a ton of
extra clothes from Calvin.

277
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,810
Pretty much Calvin has
worn Jackson's old clothes

278
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,350
so they don't really get hand-me-downs.

279
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,100
This actually was Jackson's.

280
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,110
This was Jackson's.

281
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,590
So there's a couple of Jackson's,

282
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,760
but these mostly are all
Calvin's hand-me-downs.

283
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,360
So I wanted dividers for that reason.

284
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,440
I have a bunch of baby clothes here.

285
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,250
I got these at Old Navy.

286
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,400
So he has some just little onesies.

287
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,083
Just kidding.

288
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,090
They're from The Gap.

289
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,730
I've gotta make sure that's right.

290
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,640
It doesn't matter.

291
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,650
These are from The Gap and then

292
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,420
over here these are from Target.

293
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,180
These are some good night jammies.

294
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,240
For some reason every
baby is so different.

295
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,460
I was really attracted
to blues with Jackson

296
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,610
and this baby it's been
like brown and black

297
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,790
that I've just like, it's felt good.

298
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,450
I got the baby a ton of burp cloths.

299
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,520
These are from Copper and Pearl.

300
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,353
Thank you guys.

301
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:12,740
You guys gave me the huge recommendation

302
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,770
for Copper and Pearl.

303
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,990
I know Jilly just got a bunch as well.

304
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,430
So these are just awesome burp
rags and the kind of theme

305
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,860
that I'm gonna go for is
like foresty and animals.

306
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,254
He has burp rags.

307
00:09:23,254 --> 00:09:26,680
He has a ton of bib, bandana bibs.

308
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,600
Like how sweet are those?

309
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
Like isn't that gonna be cute?

310
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,510
Can you imagine him
wearing that at Christmas?

311
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,460
- [Jared] That'll be so sweet.

312
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,670
- So he has those.

313
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,280
With every baby I get
a pack of wash cloths.

314
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,140
These are from Copper and Pearl as well.

315
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,510
Just like when you're bathing them

316
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,490
or if they happen to have
like a really bad rash,

317
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,230
I'll just use them for their bottoms

318
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,000
or giving them a bath so
I have some washcloths.

319
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,540
And this is just a bath towel for him.

320
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,160
So I've already talked about this a ton

321
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,020
but I'm gonna do it
again cause it's my haul.

322
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,720
I got this from Time Maternity.

323
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,890
It's some nipple cream.

324
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:00,730
I don't know if it's good.

325
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,685
I haven't heard anything review wise,

326
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,550
but this is what I have so we're
gonna try that bad boy out.

327
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,840
I'll let you know if it works.

328
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,200
And then I also got this
from Time Maternity, too.

329
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,520
It's a teething silicone
toy that is a camera.

330
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,360
It's a camera, people.

331
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,450
It fits his alley.

332
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,283
So I can't wait.

333
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,430
Won't that be a cute picture, too?

334
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:21,170
To take a picture of him doing that.

335
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,040
These never, ever work so
don't even know why I got them.

336
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,110
But I got them from Target.

337
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,500
They're little hand mittens.

338
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,440
They might work for him.

339
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,990
It's kind of like something that I buy

340
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,930
knowing they don't work
hoping that they will.

341
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,630
They usually rip them off and fling

342
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,790
and then they scratch their
faces and it's a hot mess.

343
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,600
So hopefully.

344
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,650
I think maybe a lot of people recommend

345
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,340
putting little sockies on their hands too,

346
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,760
so I might have to do that too.

347
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,360
Over here I have some swaddles.

348
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,070
This is from the Ollie Swaddle.

349
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,760
When I was asking
recommendations of new swaddles,

350
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,960
I was recommended a ton
about Copper and Pearl

351
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,920
and Ollie Swaddles, people love these.

352
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,920
This has come up on my
recommendations on Facebook

353
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,120
a whole ton is the Ollie Swaddle.

354
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,150
People love them.

355
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,400
The material is soft and stretchy

356
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,730
and it comes in like the cutest box ever.

357
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,360
And I'm gonna save cards
and put these in his box.

358
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,260
Every one of my babies has a box of cards.

359
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,670
I'll show you this one.

360
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,610
This box, it was Jackson's that somebody,

361
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,380
a sweet viewer had sent
us a gift for Jackson.

362
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,950
It had a Burt's Bees clothing outfit in it

363
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,690
and I saved the tin and we have

364
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,770
tons of cards in here for Jackson.

365
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:26,630
That is yours.

366
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,880
He's excited about his.

367
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,480
I decided this box was so sweet,
so I'm gonna save this box

368
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,280
for baby and put all of his cards in.

369
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,715
I also have a nursing cover
slash cover for the car seat.

370
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,840
This is from Copper Pearl.

371
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,160
It is the same matching
print as his towel.

372
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,700
And then I also got some hats and tell me

373
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,270
this is not the cutest color of hat.

374
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,110
And they have little
matching swaddles too,

375
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,390
but I thought these
hats were really sweet.

376
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:53,370
And this color, like it's so funny.

377
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,030
I would never have picked this color out

378
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,790
for Jackson and Calvin but for some reason

379
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,860
it stood out a lot.

380
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,980
Maybe it's like times have
changed or I don't know what's

381
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,210
popular right now, but I just
saw this and just thought

382
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:06,658
that looked really sweet, so
he has some hats right there.

383
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:10,020
And then we are definitely
pulling out our Owlet.

384
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,710
We got this for Calvin
when Calvin was a baby.

385
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,980
I highly recommend it.

386
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,830
I really enjoyed having it with Calvin.

387
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,140
- So basically what you do.

388
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I still have my dentist appointment too.

389
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,490
You put this on their foot
and it reads their heartbeat

390
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:25,120
and even I think some other levels.

391
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,220
Maybe oxygen.

392
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,120
So it sends all of that
information to your phone

393
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,860
so if anything does happen
you are notified right away,

394
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,300
so it's a good reassurance for parents.

395
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:38,110
I pulled out the Tula baby
carrier that I had for Calvin.

396
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,930
I love the Tulas.

397
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:42,640
The Tula and the Ergo
are very popular brands.

398
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,660
I do have both.

399
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,580
I have the Ergo more of like if

400
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,322
we were to go camping or something.

401
00:12:47,322 --> 00:12:49,670
Or like really getting dirty.

402
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,040
It's just like an older one that

403
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,790
I have but it still is good use.

404
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,600
The two I really like, I
love the head strap on it

405
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,490
and I love the way it fits
my body a little better.

406
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,910
Especially it covers the
baby a little bit more.

407
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,060
I feel like there's like an inch longer

408
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,120
than it like cups the
baby's neck a little better.

409
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,110
I feel like the Tula's a little nicer,

410
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,310
but to be honest I feel
like if you were to get one

411
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,920
or the other you'd be
really happy with either or.

412
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,460
So I pulled that out for the baby.

413
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,790
I have a few diapers, a
ton of wipes down here.

414
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,020
And then down in our
basement we have a whole ton

415
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,020
of baby wipes cause you
go through those fast.

416
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,210
But right here is just like
a little section that I have

417
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,240
for now, just of like the baby's needs.

418
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,900
I have butt paste, I have
Orajel when the time comes,

419
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,257
I have gripe water, I have
Tylenol, I have gas relief drops.

420
00:13:31,257 --> 00:13:34,180
I do have a teeny bit
of formula in the back.

421
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,580
Each baby is different.

422
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:39,040
The Mam brand is what Jackson
totally used for binkies

423
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,800
and I thought these were so cute.

424
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,480
It's a fox and a little raccoon.

425
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,000
And then this is the brand
that Calvin really liked.

426
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,833
The Soothie.

427
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,490
I love binkies.

428
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,470
It soothes the baby.

429
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,303
It helps them.

430
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:51,900
I do feel like this shaped Calvin's mouth.

431
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,750
He had to suck really hard on
it to keep it in his mouth.

432
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,120
I did find that with
Calvin that I didn't love,

433
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,840
but the dentist said that after two years

434
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,290
once they're off of it their mouths

435
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:03,850
are so shapeable and
malleable that it's okay.

436
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:06,210
So I did notice that
with this one, though.

437
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,680
So we'll see which one baby likes.

438
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,210
I remember with Calvin
it was like I had Calvin

439
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,630
and I had everything I needed
but there was one night

440
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,450
where he was fussy and
I wasn't feeling well.

441
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,320
And it's like oh, what do I need to get?

442
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,655
And Jared had to run to the
store and get gripe water.

443
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:23,260
And so I'm just trying
to remember those things

444
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,050
that would be nice just to have on hand,

445
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,390
rather than wait for the
moment that he needs it.

446
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,510
It's like teething gel.

447
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,270
He's not gonna use
teething gel for months,

448
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,290
but it's just nice to have on hand so that

449
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,330
that one night when he is fussy

450
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,810
that it's like oh his gums
are swollen, oh it's teething.

451
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,160
And I already have it.

452
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,070
So I'm trying to just stock
up on stuff that I know

453
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,020
I'm gonna need even in the
months to come with new baby.

454
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:47,500
So he also has a ton of shoes.

455
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,820
Look at all of his baby shoes.

456
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,410
These are from all of Calvin
and these are just shoes

457
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,522
that Calvin literally wore
these like for two months.

458
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,220
Those are so dang cute.

459
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,140
I love those.

460
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,340
These church shoes I think
Calvin wore these like once.

461
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,180
He definitely wore these
for a month or two.

462
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,600
It's like come on, Ellie.

463
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,550
I couldn't figure out sizing.

464
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,630
But he just has a ton of church shoes

465
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,370
and a few shoes mixed in there as well.

466
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,203
Okay.

467
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,327
The last thing I'm gonna talk about,

468
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:16,390
which was very sweet of you.

469
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,310
I didn't even know that
this was what I wanted.

470
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,180
I've been wanting, not like a diaper bag,

471
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,313
but just like a bag, like a book bag.

472
00:15:23,313 --> 00:15:26,020
And Ryla, they actually gave this to me.

473
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,330
They sent it in my P.O. box.

474
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,720
I really appreciate it.

475
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,330
They did not have to do that,
but she gave this to me.

476
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,580
I thought that was so sweet
and I've been looking for

477
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,430
like a little diaper bag anyway.

478
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:37,790
And I've gone through
a lot of diaper bags.

479
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,150
And not that I've had to, just cause

480
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,850
it's been fun and I wanted to.

481
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,040
My last diaper bag, my
Ju-Ju-Be bag, I really loved.

482
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,030
It was a backpack.

483
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,720
It was like when we were traveling a ton.

484
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,820
And that actually turned into Penny's bag.

485
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,810
We have a ton of toys and
food and stuff for Penny

486
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:54,940
in that bag and we usually
throw it in our car

487
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,680
for if we're going on a hike
or if we're going somewhere

488
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,220
we can grab stuff out of Penny's bag.

489
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,690
So that kind of turned into her bag.

490
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,880
And I really liked it, but
I don't need a huge bag.

491
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,710
I have learned that when I'm
going out, even when I have

492
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:10,210
more kids, I actually feel
like I want less space.

493
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,710
I don't know if it's because
I've adapted and known

494
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,610
what I like to use when I go out,

495
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,261
but I think this is gonna fit me perfect.

496
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:18,940
They have a pocket right here
just for like momma stuff,

497
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,380
keys, phones, and then on the inside

498
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,200
there's two insulated pockets for bottles.

499
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,240
There's a huge area.

500
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,560
Like this would totally be just

501
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,040
diapers and a swaddle blanket.

502
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,680
Like that's pretty much
what the baby needs.

503
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,840
Bottles if I'm using bottles at the time.

504
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,883
And little pockets
right here for my stuff.

505
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,870
And then they have like a
little secret pouch in the back.

506
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,040
So that was really cute
and it was something

507
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,280
that I've been looking for, too.

508
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,800
So I've never heard of them before.

509
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,633
I looked them up.

510
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:44,466
They're really cute.

511
00:16:44,466 --> 00:16:47,670
It's Ryla is their name, so
I really appreciate that.

512
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,503
That was nice.

513
00:16:48,503 --> 00:16:50,650
What if when the boys come to see the baby

514
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,900
in the hospital they're
wearing their shirts?

515
00:16:53,743 --> 00:16:54,576
Isn't that cute?

516
00:16:54,576 --> 00:16:55,910
And we can dress this on the baby.

517
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,070
- [Jared] That would be sweet.

518
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,670
You're so baby hungry right now.

519
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,270
- I'm so baby hungry.

520
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,119
I can't believe I'm at
21 weeks this week, guys.

521
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,059
- [Jared] That's insane, Ellie.

522
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,950
- Baby, we can't wait to see you.

523
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:10,369
And that is my ultimate baby haul.

524
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:13,526
I have been loving, look Jackson's in it.

525
00:17:13,527 --> 00:17:15,410
You little stinker.

526
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,819
That is what I've been
accumulating for baby.

527
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,669
He definitely doesn't
need any more clothes.

528
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,380
I may grab a few more boxes of diapers.

529
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,260
And then we are still just
debating between the bassinet.

530
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,640
We're going back and forth right now.

531
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,290
I have been loving looking on Instagram

532
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,106
and Pinterest at new baby item websites.

533
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:33,910
I love the things that I've got.

534
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,080
I'll make sure to post a link for where

535
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,750
I bought these things down
in the description as well.

536
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,830
Thank you guys so much for
helping me out as well.

537
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,480
It's really fun when I sit down on Twitter

538
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,570
and I'm like what is your guy's
favorite swaddle blankets?

539
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,540
What do you guys like for this or that?

540
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,110
It's just been really fun for me as a mom

541
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:52,729
to kind of communicate with other moms

542
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:55,560
and other people that
like have information.

543
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,800
Like as far as like even the
bottles, the Comotomo bottles.

544
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,950
When I bought those when
I was trying to figure out

545
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,470
nursing and bottles with Calvin,

546
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:05,000
I was recommended that
through social media

547
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,390
and it was very helpful for me.

548
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,671
So I do appreciate it.

549
00:18:07,671 --> 00:18:09,790
I hope you guys love this haul.

550
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:10,810
Can't wait to bring up some of

551
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,712
the baby toys and finish up the room.

552
00:18:12,712 --> 00:18:15,160
New blinds, new curtains are coming in

553
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,020
and a few more bedding items
are coming in for the bed.

554
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,902
So thank you guys for watching

555
00:18:19,902 --> 00:18:21,713
and I'll see you guys tomorrow.

556
00:18:21,713 --> 00:18:23,650
Now that my face is like not numb.

557
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,558
Awesome.

558
00:18:24,558 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
