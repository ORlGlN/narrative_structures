1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,743
- I'm coming, wanna show me?

2
00:00:02,743 --> 00:00:04,864
Jackson saw a dollar today and wanted it,

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:09,008
and I said well if you can
make your bed on your own.

4
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,591
You didn't make it.

5
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,246
- [Jackson] But I did a little.

6
00:00:14,246 --> 00:00:17,921
- [Ellie] No you've done
a lot better job before.

7
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:21,231
You did a good job but
it needs to be made more.

8
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,750
- But I want help.

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,280
- [Ellie] I'm happy to help but
I'm gonna watch you make it.

10
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,780
- This zipper's too strong.

11
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,706
- [Ellie] Don't grab the
zipper just grab the bed

12
00:00:29,706 --> 00:00:33,289
and pull all the way
and make it look nice.

13
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:36,892
Super spider jump?

14
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,757
See now it'll be easier to zip.

15
00:00:42,757 --> 00:00:44,507
Now try and zip this.

16
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:50,096
See how much easier that is?

17
00:00:50,096 --> 00:00:51,398
Perfect.

18
00:00:51,398 --> 00:00:53,394
And it doesn't have to be
all the way zipped either.

19
00:00:53,394 --> 00:00:54,727
That looks good.

20
00:01:01,226 --> 00:01:02,786
Good job.

21
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:04,280
- [Jackson] I'm gonna go tell dad.

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,803
- Before we get too far in today's vlog,

23
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:07,280
I want to give some clarification

24
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,710
of the IVF grant announcement.

25
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,994
We will be picking the IVF grant winners

26
00:01:11,994 --> 00:01:13,552
on Friday the 22nd

27
00:01:13,552 --> 00:01:16,858
and that announcement video
will go up on the 23rd.

28
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:18,048
I've seen some people ask some questions

29
00:01:18,048 --> 00:01:19,970
about that with the terms
and conditions and everything

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,533
and I just wanted to
give some clarification

31
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:23,324
so you guys are aware when everything

32
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:27,091
is going to be happening live
on the YouTube channel too.

33
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:30,780
So picking on the 22nd,
announcing on the 23rd.

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,150
We announced the contest
on Saturday the 9th,

35
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,365
we ended the application
process on Saturday the 16th,

36
00:01:36,365 --> 00:01:39,232
and the announcement will
be on Saturday the 23rd.

37
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,062
Now let's build some gingerbread houses.

38
00:01:41,062 --> 00:01:43,645
- [Ellie] We are getting ready.

39
00:01:44,882 --> 00:01:48,309
We're making gingerbread houses!

40
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,645
Are these gonna be your sprinkles?

41
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:51,654
- No.

42
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:52,737
- [Ellie] No?

43
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:55,887
- [Jared] Good, next one.

44
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,494
Squeeze squeeze good job.

45
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,329
Good squeeze, look at that perfection,

46
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,670
that alignment it's amazing,
it's perfect great job bud.

47
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,318
- [Ellie] Building gingerbread houses

48
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:08,398
take a long time huh Jacks?

49
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:10,648
- Oh we did the wrong side.

50
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:14,057
We gotta do this side, not that side.

51
00:02:14,057 --> 00:02:15,446
- [Ellie] Jackson helped
us put frosting there

52
00:02:15,446 --> 00:02:16,792
but we had to let it dry

53
00:02:16,792 --> 00:02:18,113
and now we're putting it together

54
00:02:18,113 --> 00:02:20,807
and then after church
we'll decorate it huh?

55
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,898
- This is all just about
creating a solid foundation.

56
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:25,398
You know you have to
have a solid foundation

57
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:28,867
when you build your gingerbread house.

58
00:02:28,867 --> 00:02:31,122
- [Ellie] Just like with
life in general, huh?

59
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:32,478
It helps.

60
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:34,107
- Ready to help me again?

61
00:02:34,107 --> 00:02:35,524
Okay you squeeze.

62
00:02:38,254 --> 00:02:40,257
Oh my goodness gracious Jackson,

63
00:02:40,257 --> 00:02:41,965
you should be a surgeon.

64
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:43,681
- Oh my gosh.

65
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,184
Alright today's been a little,

66
00:02:45,184 --> 00:02:47,595
are you laughing at my legs?

67
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:50,678
- [Jared] Yes I just saw you walk by.

68
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,945
This is how I saw you walk by.

69
00:02:57,945 --> 00:03:00,320
You had the camera and you were like.

70
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,556
- A few weeks ago I ordered
some thigh-high nylons,

71
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:07,149
because it hurts my stomach to wear nylons

72
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:09,106
and I like to wear nylons
in the winter to church

73
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,323
because I think it looks good.

74
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:14,574
And I ordered thigh-high
nylons from Amazon,

75
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:17,540
they were like 12 bucks, 13 bucks.

76
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,957
I wore them once.

77
00:03:20,306 --> 00:03:21,365
I'm out of breath.

78
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:23,584
I wore them once and
this is what I look like.

79
00:03:23,584 --> 00:03:25,917
Hello, wardrobe malfunction!

80
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,172
I just got back from a meeting

81
00:03:28,172 --> 00:03:31,600
I was like yeah, this doesn't work.

82
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,433
This don't work Ellie.

83
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:37,306
Yeah one week with those bad boys,

84
00:03:37,306 --> 00:03:38,932
I am so unbelievably sad.

85
00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:42,873
So what I'm gonna do it
grab a pair of nylons,

86
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,527
it's when I've had this bag

87
00:03:44,527 --> 00:03:45,840
that I've always had my nylons in

88
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,579
since Jared and I got married.

89
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,940
And it's just been my nylons
where I just like throw.

90
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,107
I know I have some special
ones that I'm thinking of.

91
00:03:58,478 --> 00:03:59,328
Yeah these.

92
00:03:59,328 --> 00:04:02,894
Oh I don't know if that'd be cute,

93
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:04,393
we'll see, we'll see.

94
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:06,958
But I am gonna cut the sides
of them so they're not tight.

95
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,552
I just cut the tops pretty much off

96
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,731
so they'll at least stay above my butt

97
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:13,021
but not cut into my belly.

98
00:04:13,021 --> 00:04:15,146
There we go I'm gonna try these.

99
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:15,979
Boo hoo!

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,326
But happy that I'm 12 weeks,

101
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,728
and I'm feeling really good today.

102
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,904
I don't have like a crazy
huge bump but it's there.

103
00:04:24,904 --> 00:04:25,828
Hi little guy.

104
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,654
Saving grace, these nylons for some reason

105
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:29,932
aren't like your typical nylons

106
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,912
because they're mesh and have holes in it.

107
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:34,062
So it's not tight so I
don't need to cut them.

108
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:37,559
I know they have maternity
nylons that I'll probably get.

109
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,776
I remember wearing them with Jackson.

110
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:42,662
I think this is actually cuter

111
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:45,538
because of the texture the nylons have.

112
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,806
There's kind of like little holes in them.

113
00:04:48,806 --> 00:04:51,504
So this is what I'm wearing,
I'm so out of breath.

114
00:04:51,504 --> 00:04:54,414
Okay so I really feel
fancy today for church.

115
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:58,369
I got this dress last year from J. Crew

116
00:04:58,369 --> 00:04:59,989
and I got it for Christmas last year

117
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:04,412
and I got this vest last
year from Madewell I believe.

118
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:08,010
And then I got the shoes
about three years ago

119
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,281
from Nordstroms.

120
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:12,814
And I wear these shoes just
like four or five times a year,

121
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,350
around Christmas.

122
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,288
Hi, you're gonna bring Kelly to church?

123
00:05:18,288 --> 00:05:20,139
He named the lamb Kelly.

124
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:21,923
So yeah I always feel
fancy when I wear them

125
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,703
because they're like my special
Christmas holiday shoes.

126
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:26,908
So this is my outfit for church.

127
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:29,372
I feel very pretty but
I'm very out of breath

128
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:31,177
and I'm glad I got those nylons situated.

129
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:32,989
That would've been embarrassing,

130
00:05:32,989 --> 00:05:35,265
having them fall down
in the middle of church.

131
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:36,223
- You ready?

132
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:38,057
You ready for this one?

133
00:05:38,057 --> 00:05:39,691
Oh it's like your favorite.

134
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:41,441
Okay one, two, three.

135
00:05:45,975 --> 00:05:47,044
(laughs)

136
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:50,417
I have literally slipped like four times,

137
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,377
and it's not even slippery,

138
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:53,291
like it's just kind of wet a little bit.

139
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,015
All of the snow's right there.

140
00:05:55,015 --> 00:05:58,185
But my shoes are so
slippery, my church shoes.

141
00:05:58,185 --> 00:05:59,373
We just got back from church,

142
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:02,174
Penny and I have been playing
outside for a little bit.

143
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:06,517
And they boys are anxiously
awaiting to decorate.

144
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:09,939
You guys ready to rock
and roll this Paw Patrol?

145
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:12,619
Oh Jackson, yours is looking so good.

146
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:15,848
Gonna outline it with some blue?

147
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:16,759
Nice.

148
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,229
Calvin we need to get some
frosting on top of yours,

149
00:06:19,229 --> 00:06:20,149
that we you can decorate up here.

150
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:21,592
Should we do that?

151
00:06:21,592 --> 00:06:22,780
Okay.

152
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,973
- Three hours is not okay
to leave me without food.

153
00:06:26,973 --> 00:06:30,130
- Ellie is literally
scrambling as fast as she can

154
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,890
to get something to eat after church.

155
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:32,969
- I may have just been very dramatic

156
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,381
and said my life is ruined.

157
00:06:35,381 --> 00:06:40,240
I said and I instantly was
like I shouldn't say that.

158
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,973
- We didn't have any limes so Ellie's like

159
00:06:41,973 --> 00:06:43,473
my life is ruined.

160
00:06:45,281 --> 00:06:48,893
- I am so hungry I'm gonna get pissed.

161
00:06:48,893 --> 00:06:51,845
- Hangry is coming your
way, the hangriness.

162
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,740
Hey boys just a word of
advice for your future wives

163
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,755
and girlfriends and all of that,

164
00:06:57,755 --> 00:06:59,494
just as long as you make sure

165
00:06:59,494 --> 00:07:02,906
your lady friends aren't
hangry, you're golden.

166
00:07:02,906 --> 00:07:03,773
That's like half the battle

167
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:07,314
is keeping them not hangry right?

168
00:07:07,314 --> 00:07:08,147
Uh huh.

169
00:07:09,686 --> 00:07:13,353
(upbeat instrumental music)

170
00:07:20,402 --> 00:07:25,353
Holy purple mountain
majesty, look at that sunset.

171
00:07:25,353 --> 00:07:26,485
That's amazing.

172
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:28,749
Hi Penny girl, you ready to get going?

173
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,582
Should we go?

174
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,660
Come on, let's go.

175
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,260
That sky was amazing, it was
lit up like the 4th of July,

176
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,799
it was like the sky was on fire,

177
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,378
it was incredible, it was amazing.

178
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,840
Oh my goodness gracious.

179
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,163
So the kid's are done decorating,

180
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:42,435
they're actually downstairs
playing right now,

181
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:44,696
but I wanted to show you the final results

182
00:07:44,696 --> 00:07:47,076
of our gingerbread houses.

183
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,181
This is Jackson's,

184
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,539
look he's got all the Paw Patrol friends

185
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,857
and even the telescope, the look-out.

186
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:53,854
So cool.

187
00:07:53,854 --> 00:07:56,100
And then this is Calvin's.

188
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,654
Look I did the blue stuff,

189
00:07:57,654 --> 00:08:01,751
but he did all of the
stuff on top himself.

190
00:08:01,751 --> 00:08:02,825
Isn't that fun?

191
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:04,537
That's so cute.

192
00:08:04,537 --> 00:08:05,716
Good job boys!

193
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:09,082
You did your best and you forgot the rest.

194
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:11,074
I think that's a Paw Patrol reference.

195
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:11,907
Tonight is extra special,

196
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,998
we're going to a
production of The Messiah,

197
00:08:14,998 --> 00:08:18,200
my dad is in the choir here in Utah

198
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,485
and they're putting on The Messiah.

199
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:23,168
It's a full orchestra, full
singing and all of that.

200
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:24,708
But that's probably not
the most interesting part

201
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,693
about this evening,

202
00:08:25,693 --> 00:08:28,321
and I'd like to pass the time
over to my dear wife Ellie,

203
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,217
to explain more.

204
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,300
(laughs)

205
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,918
- I don't wanna talk about it.

206
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:40,090
I was like should we bring kids,

207
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,279
should I just stay home
put the kids to bed?

208
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,196
And Jared's dad is like

209
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,441
kid's need to be exposed to the music,

210
00:08:47,441 --> 00:08:49,469
bring them and it'll be fun.

211
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:51,382
Kids might get a little antsy

212
00:08:51,382 --> 00:08:52,703
but I'm glad we're gonna go.

213
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:54,110
And I said, kids we can go to bed

214
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,716
or we can go listen to grandpa sing.

215
00:08:55,716 --> 00:08:57,446
And of course they wanna
listen to grandpa sing.

216
00:08:57,446 --> 00:08:59,485
- And it's a good opportunity for them

217
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:01,937
to sit and learn and listen.

218
00:09:01,937 --> 00:09:04,408
- It'll be good though, Christmas music.

219
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:08,214
The bad news is, we got home from church,

220
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:12,723
I don't think I can go to
church the rest of my pregnancy.

221
00:09:12,723 --> 00:09:14,818
Because I need to eat every hour.

222
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:17,157
Even though I brought a
few things to suck on,

223
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,394
it was not enough and I
ate good before we left.

224
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,343
I got home and I ate some dip
and ate a little bit of stuff.

225
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:27,186
I did like cucumbers and
beans and chips and stuff.

226
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:31,269
But I legitimately told
Jared, I said I can tell,

227
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,819
we might go to this and
we might leave early

228
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:36,777
because I might explode.

229
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,976
Like I might go to the
bathroom in my pants.

230
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:43,510
It's happened before and
it could happen again.

231
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,875
I know that I am not the only person,

232
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,773
and I would not be talking like this

233
00:09:47,773 --> 00:09:50,428
if I was the only person
this ever happened to.

234
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,962
So I'm just gonna be open with you.

235
00:09:51,962 --> 00:09:56,698
Pregnant, stomach's very
upset, we'll see how it goes.

236
00:09:56,698 --> 00:09:57,612
I feel okay right now

237
00:09:57,612 --> 00:09:59,820
but two seconds ago I was like
I think I've gotta go home.

238
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,567
- [Jared] It's coming in waves.

239
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,400
Good luck Ellie!

240
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,730
- We'll be good.

241
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,843
- [Jared] Well we've
already got one lightweight.

242
00:10:05,843 --> 00:10:10,493
This might actually turn
out really really nice.

243
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,576
There he is, right there.

244
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,216
Did you see him?

245
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,251
He was waving at you.

246
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,501
Isn't this fun?

247
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:24,303
Oh geez.

248
00:10:24,303 --> 00:10:27,328
Hey dad, I'm excited
to hear you guys sing.

249
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:28,442
- We're excited to sing.

250
00:10:28,442 --> 00:10:30,525
(laughs)

251
00:11:01,402 --> 00:11:03,902
- Holy cow you guys rocked it.

252
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,551
You were good.

253
00:11:06,551 --> 00:11:07,576
- Did you like that?

254
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:08,876
- They loved the music.

255
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,932
- Yeah they did there was lots of times

256
00:11:10,932 --> 00:11:14,604
where they were just sitting and staring.

257
00:11:14,604 --> 00:11:17,242
- He thought the Hallelujah
was Captain Underpants

258
00:11:17,242 --> 00:11:18,761
and he laughed.

259
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,996
- Jackson did you like that music?

260
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:22,357
It was good huh?

261
00:11:22,357 --> 00:11:26,465
- How does the Captain Underpants song go?

262
00:11:26,465 --> 00:11:28,934
- [Ellie] He laughed so hard.

263
00:11:28,934 --> 00:11:33,613
Last night's midnight
snack was fruit and yogurt

264
00:11:33,613 --> 00:11:36,363
and tonight's snack is ice cream.

265
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:39,765
- It's like this ice cream
is frozen or something.

266
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:40,768
- [Ellie] What was really funny is

267
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:44,287
tonight I put on my onesie outfit

268
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:46,381
and it was actually Jared's

269
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:47,888
and then Jared put on a onesie outfit

270
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:48,867
and it was actually mine.

271
00:11:48,867 --> 00:11:49,700
I didn't think anything of it

272
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,376
I just thought it's just a big onesie.

273
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:53,467
- Well it was in my drawer and I put it on

274
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:55,138
I was like oh my gosh this shrunk.

275
00:11:55,138 --> 00:11:56,156
- You should've seen it,

276
00:11:56,156 --> 00:11:57,317
if I could have filmed it I would have,

277
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,560
but it was way too inappropriate.

278
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,441
It was hilarious.

279
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:04,036
But it's midnight and Jared and I

280
00:12:04,036 --> 00:12:07,036
are going over the IVF applications,

281
00:12:07,983 --> 00:12:10,966
and it's been very emotional.

282
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,833
Took a break, Jackson
woke up a little bit.

283
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,931
Now we're gonna get back and eat a snack.

284
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,729
That is our vlog for the day guys,

285
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,308
thank you so much for watching.

286
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,643
This has been an amazing week.

287
00:12:22,643 --> 00:12:24,904
Thanks for all of your loving comments,

288
00:12:24,904 --> 00:12:27,225
especially about our gender reveal.

289
00:12:27,225 --> 00:12:28,558
Baby boy, crazy.

290
00:12:30,456 --> 00:12:33,009
Do you like the name Mason?

291
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,399
- Mason?

292
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,701
It's growing on me.

293
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,905
- [Ellie] Aw, that's Jacks again.

294
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,036
- That's my cue.

295
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:41,619
- I just went down.

296
00:12:42,549 --> 00:12:44,668
He has a stuffy nose.

297
00:12:44,668 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay, we'll see you guys, bye.
