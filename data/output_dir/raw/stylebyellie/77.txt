1
00:00:00,136 --> 00:00:01,261
(laughing)
(bright music)

2
00:00:01,261 --> 00:00:03,631
- [Jared] You guys aren't
being much help around here.

3
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:06,179
- When I dip, you dip, we all dip.

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,491
- I'm not that smart.

5
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:09,244
I need my phone to do stuff for me.

6
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:10,291
Do you agree Ellie?

7
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,459
She said yes.

8
00:00:11,459 --> 00:00:12,292
Darn it.

9
00:00:12,292 --> 00:00:14,945
- Spouses that cook
together, stay together.

10
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:15,778
- Hey!

11
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:17,877
What would you like to fondue next.

12
00:00:17,877 --> 00:00:18,830
(Jared laughs)

13
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:20,631
- [Ellie] Hi cutie patootie.

14
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:22,214
- Hi cutie patotty.

15
00:00:23,142 --> 00:00:25,229
- [Ellie] What are you drinking?

16
00:00:25,229 --> 00:00:26,564
- Coconutties.

17
00:00:26,564 --> 00:00:28,243
- [Ellie] What?

18
00:00:28,243 --> 00:00:31,610
He thinks these are called cococonutties.

19
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,840
But he's drinking some grape juice.

20
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,726
- Those are corn pops.

21
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:38,356
- [Ellie] Corn pops, that's correct silly.

22
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:39,762
You tryin' to trick me.

23
00:00:39,762 --> 00:00:40,595
- Yeah.

24
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:41,428
- [Ellie] Don't be a trickster.

25
00:00:41,428 --> 00:00:43,735
- I want to go with you downstairs.

26
00:00:43,735 --> 00:00:45,089
- [Ellie] You want to
come with me downstairs?

27
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:45,922
- Yes.

28
00:00:46,813 --> 00:00:47,646
Ahhhh.

29
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,666
- [Ellie] Good morning.

30
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:50,499
- Good morning.

31
00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:52,196
- It is a gorgeous day outside.

32
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:53,029
Look at that sun.

33
00:00:53,029 --> 00:00:54,724
It's so bright.

34
00:00:54,724 --> 00:00:56,368
The rock tumbler is still going.

35
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:57,660
(tumbler humming)

36
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,131
We've got two days left on this cycle.

37
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,845
And then we've got another seven days

38
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:04,501
and then I think another
five days after that.

39
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:07,237
But Mom is out doing
some errands real quick

40
00:01:07,237 --> 00:01:08,917
and this kitchen is a disaster.

41
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,053
We got home last night

42
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:11,333
and we kinda just unloaded everything.

43
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:13,700
We didn't really put
everything single thing away,

44
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,306
other than clothes,

45
00:01:15,306 --> 00:01:16,139
so boys

46
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,436
I think it's time for
operation mission mission

47
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:20,940
that we clean up this kitchen,

48
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,148
before Mom gets home.

49
00:01:22,148 --> 00:01:23,244
Because little surprises like that

50
00:01:23,244 --> 00:01:24,596
are the best ever.

51
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,805
(laughing)

52
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:30,472
You guys aren't being
much help around here.

53
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:32,445
What the heck?

54
00:01:32,445 --> 00:01:33,972
- Hey, I just did that out of habit.

55
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:35,535
I turned the camera on

56
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:37,816
and I went to flick the screen up

57
00:01:37,816 --> 00:01:39,615
and I don't have to any more, the lens up,

58
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:41,786
because it's fixed, because
we have a new camera.

59
00:01:41,786 --> 00:01:43,289
Jared!

60
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,449
Kitchen looks amazing,

61
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:46,689
that was so sweet to come home to.

62
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,416
Look what Cullen and Katie
got us for Christmas.

63
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,200
I want to go get some bread today.

64
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,096
I want to figure out
what to do with all this.

65
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:56,639
It's a dipping, a dipping session.

66
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:59,854
So when I dip, you dip, we all dip!

67
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,318
Did I do that right?

68
00:02:01,318 --> 00:02:03,396
- [Jared] Yeah that's how it works.

69
00:02:03,396 --> 00:02:04,843
- Jared made me do that.

70
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,084
Jared wanted me to say that.

71
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:06,995
I don't even know what I'm talking about,

72
00:02:06,995 --> 00:02:08,814
he's like just make sure if you do this,

73
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:11,208
tell 'em that we dip, we
all dip, I don't know.

74
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,008
Anyway, they got us this dipping stuff,

75
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:14,401
which is really cool.

76
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,640
I need to read if it's just
regular bread you use or,

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,965
looks like it.

78
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,857
It says easy and fun to dip.

79
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,858
That's so cool.

80
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,882
I love gifts like this.

81
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:26,777
Thank you guys.

82
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:27,713
Let's do that.

83
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:30,537
Okay, so today, tonight,

84
00:02:30,537 --> 00:02:32,959
what we should do is do bread dipping

85
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,639
and then tonight I'll get
some chocolate stuff too,

86
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,606
so we can dip bread
and chocolate, how fun.

87
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:39,581
That's what we'll do tonight.

88
00:02:39,581 --> 00:02:41,366
We're in the parking lot (laughs)

89
00:02:41,366 --> 00:02:42,633
of the grocery store,

90
00:02:42,633 --> 00:02:44,233
with the sun in my eyes.

91
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,281
And Jared, what are you doing?

92
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,910
- I'm on a mission Ellie.

93
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,621
I'm on a very important mission

94
00:02:49,621 --> 00:02:53,790
and the mission is all about Instant Pot.

95
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,618
I thought, I was like, you know what,

96
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:56,659
we've got this Instant Pot,

97
00:02:56,659 --> 00:02:57,902
when I was cleaning the
kitchen, I was like,

98
00:02:57,902 --> 00:02:59,206
I really want to use it

99
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:00,598
and take advantage of it.

100
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:01,928
So I'm looking up--
- Agreed.

101
00:03:01,928 --> 00:03:03,252
- Instant Pot recipes,

102
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,085
because I think like--

103
00:03:04,085 --> 00:03:05,620
oh Instant Pot Chicken Teriyaki,

104
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,764
boom, that's exactly
what I was looking for.

105
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:10,477
Some sort of chicken
and rice and vegetables

106
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,544
sounds really great tonight.

107
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:15,328
- Have you guys used
your Christmas gifts yet?

108
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,222
I've used my Instant Pot a few times,

109
00:03:17,222 --> 00:03:18,111
but for boiled eggs,

110
00:03:18,111 --> 00:03:19,527
so tonight we are gonna try it

111
00:03:19,527 --> 00:03:22,038
for the first time making a meal.

112
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:23,246
- You did it with eggs though,

113
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:24,686
oh so this is the meal.

114
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:26,220
This is the real deal meal.
- Yeah.

115
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,792
- [Ellie] Yeah, this is us trying it out.

116
00:03:27,792 --> 00:03:29,054
- We're not gonna do veal,

117
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:30,407
- [Ellie] Ew, I don't want veal.

118
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:31,746
- But it's gonna be a real deal meal.

119
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,250
- I'm just trying to rhyme.
- Okay let's go.

120
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,083
- So look five minutes to prepare,

121
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,454
five minutes to cook,

122
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:37,295
served with broccoli over a bed of rice,

123
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:40,197
quinoa or flatbread, ain't no
thing, let's get some chicken.

124
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:41,491
- Perfect.

125
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:42,875
Smith's Marketplace.

126
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:45,458
We usually go to the
grocery store right by us,

127
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:47,667
but our neighbor, they just got a hot tub

128
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,378
and they told Jared that this place

129
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:51,456
has the hot tub supply stuff.

130
00:03:51,456 --> 00:03:54,286
- And it's like 50% cheaper
- Yeah.

131
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:55,911
- than, but let's go inside,

132
00:03:55,911 --> 00:03:56,744
because I want to show ya.
- Let's go try.

133
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:58,098
- So all the chemicals
that we use in the hot tub

134
00:03:58,098 --> 00:04:00,157
are based off of test strips.

135
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,909
They're just like this

136
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,765
and you put it in the water

137
00:04:03,765 --> 00:04:06,181
and then it shows the
results on colored strips

138
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:07,417
and then you have to match that

139
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,129
within a certain color range.

140
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:11,211
But my neighbor was telling me,

141
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:12,406
he's like I went to Smith's Marketplace

142
00:04:12,406 --> 00:04:15,654
and found that they have smart strips,

143
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:18,045
that you can actually
connect it with your phone,

144
00:04:18,045 --> 00:04:20,172
and it'll tell you exactly
how much you need to do.

145
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,257
So I'm going to try that

146
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,488
and see how much better it is.

147
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:25,264
Because I like smart stuff,

148
00:04:25,264 --> 00:04:27,432
because I'm not that smart,

149
00:04:27,432 --> 00:04:29,137
I need my phone to do stuff for me.

150
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:31,128
Do you agree Ellie?

151
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,264
She said yes.

152
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,097
Darnit.

153
00:04:33,097 --> 00:04:35,264
PH up, PH down, clarifier.

154
00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:37,896
Sometimes I just laugh at myself

155
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:41,182
and ourselves, our little hot tub supply

156
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:43,590
and Instant Pot grocery shopping

157
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,552
turned into a fondue
dessert part shopping.

158
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:49,281
- And Jackson's birthday shopping.

159
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:50,114
What?

160
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:52,486
- Yeah, surprise there.

161
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,973
It's a secret, we can't tell ya.

162
00:04:54,973 --> 00:04:56,528
But we walked out of there,

163
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,873
and I'm looking at our groceries,

164
00:04:57,873 --> 00:04:59,187
and I'm like, we're gonna have

165
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:01,527
a fondue party tonight, like dessert.

166
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:03,908
We got chocolate, we got goodies

167
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:05,322
to dip in the chocolate.

168
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:06,169
It's gonna be a great night.

169
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:07,860
- Seriously, thank you Cullen and Katie.

170
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,973
I think that's what we'll do

171
00:05:08,973 --> 00:05:10,303
when the kids go to bed.

172
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:11,749
- Yeah, oh yeah yeah.
- We'll have dinner

173
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:13,332
- - Much too good for children.
- And then we'll party.

174
00:05:13,332 --> 00:05:14,608
- Tots.
- Yeah.

175
00:05:14,608 --> 00:05:17,322
- Hot tub, dipping, chocolate.

176
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:19,149
- Yes, we're gonna dip.

177
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,156
We dip, you dip.

178
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:22,562
- No Ellie, it's the (laughs)

179
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:23,836
I heard her in the other room.

180
00:05:23,836 --> 00:05:26,375
It's when I put your hand upon your hip,

181
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,830
then I dip, you dip, we dip.

182
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,877
I put your hand up on my hip,

183
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:31,387
then I dip, you dip, we dip.

184
00:05:31,387 --> 00:05:32,220
You know what I mean?

185
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,053
- [Ellie] Tots.

186
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:33,886
- You got it?

187
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:34,719
You feeling me?

188
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:35,552
You picking up what I'm putting down?

189
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,047
- Spouses that cook
together, stay together.

190
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:38,880
- Hey!

191
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,824
- Jared's cutting, I'm cutting.

192
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:43,991
I got the veggies, he's got the meat.

193
00:05:43,991 --> 00:05:45,430
We're gonna try this.

194
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,471
I hope they taste good.

195
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,911
It's our first official meal

196
00:05:47,911 --> 00:05:49,885
in our Instant Pot.
- Insta Pot.

197
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:51,069
- Insta Pot or Instant Pot?

198
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,510
- [Jared] Instant or Insta?

199
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,420
I like Insta.

200
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,187
- I like Insta Pot, but I
think it says Instant Pot.

201
00:05:57,187 --> 00:05:58,020
I don't know.

202
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,853
(tumbler humming)

203
00:05:58,853 --> 00:06:00,910
Mr. Jackson's rock tumbler,

204
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,110
his rock tumbler only has one more day

205
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,453
until we add another grit in,

206
00:06:05,453 --> 00:06:07,597
and then we are on grit three

207
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:09,070
of shining his rocks.

208
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,595
We only need to do one
more cycle of seven days,

209
00:06:11,595 --> 00:06:12,857
then it's done.

210
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,766
- I can't do these parts.

211
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:15,599
- [Ellie] You can't do these parts,

212
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:17,349
you're doing so good.

213
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,736
Wow.

214
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:21,395
That one?

215
00:06:21,395 --> 00:06:23,435
Yep, that's a good one.

216
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:24,290
You're doing good.

217
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,954
He's getting a little flustered.

218
00:06:25,954 --> 00:06:28,676
- Mom, but this one's not going right.

219
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:29,772
- [Ellie] Let me see.

220
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:30,975
- [Jackson] The turtle one.

221
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:32,988
- [Ellie] Oh well that's the spot.

222
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,076
Oh, you just kinda had to push it.

223
00:06:35,076 --> 00:06:36,838
Or it's a new one, we're breaking it in.

224
00:06:36,838 --> 00:06:37,921
There you go.

225
00:06:40,029 --> 00:06:42,446
Where do you think that goes?

226
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:44,797
(Ellie laughs)

227
00:06:44,797 --> 00:06:46,622
So many choices.

228
00:06:46,622 --> 00:06:49,205
Look at the biggest piece left.

229
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:52,797
- Here.

230
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:54,010
- [Ellie] Perfect.

231
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,861
- It goes here.

232
00:06:54,861 --> 00:06:56,146
- [Ellie] I like that.

233
00:06:56,146 --> 00:06:59,276
- Okay, don't spill everything.

234
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:01,093
- [Ellie] Well that's the
weirdest way I would've--

235
00:07:01,093 --> 00:07:02,116
- [Jared] How would you have done it?

236
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:04,217
- [Ellie] Not with the whisk.

237
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,284
Oh my.
(Jared laughing)

238
00:07:06,284 --> 00:07:07,508
- I'll clean it up, I promise.

239
00:07:07,508 --> 00:07:09,151
- [Ellie] Is everyone else cringing?

240
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,865
- [Jared] Look, 90% of
it made it in there.

241
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,471
- [Ellie] It's just a
small mess, but (laughs).

242
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,885
- [Jared] Perfect.

243
00:07:15,885 --> 00:07:17,895
- [Ellie] Don't forget your onion.

244
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,249
- [Jared] The less onion the better.

245
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:21,271
- [Ellie] Let's see it.

246
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:23,071
Wow, good job.

247
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:24,608
Do you want to do it again?

248
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:26,816
- I want, but I want help.

249
00:07:26,816 --> 00:07:28,623
- [Ellie] You want a little help?

250
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,764
Okay, get the honey in there.

251
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:33,452
♪ Oh honey honey bum bum bum bum ♪

252
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:35,500
Mr. Calvin is asleep.

253
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,419
It is six o'clock.

254
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,955
So either he'll wake up in an hour

255
00:07:38,955 --> 00:07:40,019
and be up 'til 10.

256
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:42,595
Or he'll be in bed for the night.

257
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,765
- I'm assuming it'll be the former.

258
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,483
- [Ellie] Crap, so he's gonna have to eat

259
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:49,921
all the good stuff with us.

260
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:50,777
Aww.

261
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,394
(Ellie laughs)

262
00:07:52,394 --> 00:07:53,227
- We need to turn it on.

263
00:07:53,227 --> 00:07:56,029
- [Ellie] Do you see the pressure level?

264
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,810
- [Jared] We need to turn it on.

265
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,643
How do you turn it on?

266
00:08:00,885 --> 00:08:01,718
- [Ellie] I don't know, when I did it,

267
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:03,749
I just did pressure cook.

268
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,701
(beeping)

269
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,065
- Oh.
- I want to do it.

270
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:07,730
- High pressure.

271
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,229
Okay push it, now push it again.

272
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:12,714
Good job.
- High pressure.

273
00:08:12,714 --> 00:08:13,750
- [Ellie] For how many minutes?

274
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,583
- For five.

275
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,416
Got it.

276
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:16,967
- [Ellie] Okay, now I think you
don't need to push anything.

277
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:18,968
It just starts going.

278
00:08:18,968 --> 00:08:20,084
- [Jared] I hope so.

279
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:20,917
(beeps)

280
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,311
- There we go.
- Oh it's on.

281
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:24,159
- We can figure this out.

282
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:26,144
- [Ellie] It's like a
little time machine thing.

283
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:28,498
Okay, we're gonna figure it out.

284
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:29,331
I just want you to know

285
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:30,776
that this has not been the easiest.

286
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:31,768
There's dog hair.

287
00:08:31,768 --> 00:08:33,607
Not the easiest process

288
00:08:33,607 --> 00:08:36,447
and we both may have
gotten a little impatient

289
00:08:36,448 --> 00:08:38,596
with the Instant Pot and each other.

290
00:08:38,596 --> 00:08:39,429
- We're learning.

291
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,520
- [Ellie] You happy?

292
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,361
The chicken is done.

293
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:42,696
The sauce is done.

294
00:08:42,697 --> 00:08:44,960
The veggies look awesome

295
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,048
and the rice is done.

296
00:08:46,048 --> 00:08:48,024
So I think we can eat.

297
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,530
We're gonna get it all situated.

298
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,363
- Phew.

299
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,196
Got it.

300
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:55,757
(Ellie laughs)

301
00:08:55,757 --> 00:08:58,340
- [Ellie] What's your thoughts?

302
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:01,127
Is it good or bad?

303
00:09:01,127 --> 00:09:02,174
- Good!

304
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:03,007
- It's good?

305
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:04,852
Okay, you ate your
broccoli, eat your rice.

306
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:05,859
Jare bear?

307
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:07,785
- Sorry I'm taking a
picture for Instagram.

308
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,115
(laughs)

309
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,478
It looks good, doesn't it?

310
00:09:10,478 --> 00:09:11,607
- It really does.

311
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:12,703
- I haven't tasted it yet.

312
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,206
- It's not like it's hard, it was just,

313
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:17,085
they're a little
intimidating to work with.

314
00:09:17,085 --> 00:09:19,277
- Well yeah, because if
you make one wrong move,

315
00:09:19,277 --> 00:09:21,494
Psssssssssssssst,

316
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,824
- It's a little intimidating.
- You know?

317
00:09:22,824 --> 00:09:24,697
- But I think if we use it more

318
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,747
than a few times, we'll
get the hang of it.

319
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:28,417
This looks amazing.

320
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,537
That looks so good.

321
00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:32,905
- What impressed me the most was

322
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,377
how fast and how well
the chicken was cooked.

323
00:09:35,377 --> 00:09:36,289
- [Ellie] Oh yeah.

324
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,122
- You know?

325
00:09:37,122 --> 00:09:38,695
Cooked all the way through,

326
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:41,071
moist and soft, like yeah.

327
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,265
- What do you think?

328
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:43,947
What do you think Jare?

329
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:45,772
- I think it could use
a little more sauce.

330
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,833
- What did we do, so people know.

331
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,482
- So for my first Instant Pot creation,

332
00:09:50,482 --> 00:09:53,162
what I did was I took chicken breasts

333
00:09:53,162 --> 00:09:54,522
and I sliced them in half,

334
00:09:54,522 --> 00:09:56,444
placed them in the bottom
of the Instant Pot,

335
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:59,368
put in some pepper flakes,

336
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,808
some ginger powder, ginger
powder, is that right?

337
00:10:01,808 --> 00:10:02,641
- [Ellie] Mmm-hmmm, mmm-hmm.

338
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:05,124
- Some pepper and a little bit of salt.

339
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:06,370
- And you put a separate bowl

340
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:08,178
and you put in onion, bell pepper,

341
00:10:08,178 --> 00:10:09,642
whatever veggies you want,

342
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,082
you put in a half a cup of honey.

343
00:10:11,082 --> 00:10:12,872
- Yep, I did, that was fun.

344
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:15,257
- Half a cup of honey, a
little bit of olive oil.

345
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,090
- Yep.

346
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,657
- You did a little bit of ginger,

347
00:10:17,657 --> 00:10:18,747
a little bit of pepper flakes,

348
00:10:18,747 --> 00:10:20,776
pretty much whatever flavoring you want.

349
00:10:20,776 --> 00:10:24,316
- And then I did two
tablespoons or three tablespoons

350
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:25,743
of Teriyaki sauce.

351
00:10:25,743 --> 00:10:27,464
And I felt like I could
do a little bit more.

352
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:28,690
- We should've added like a half a cup.

353
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:30,262
- Yeah seriously, we should've put it on,

354
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,092
and that's the nice thing
about Teriyaki sauce,

355
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:33,683
is you can just add it in

356
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,464
after the fact.
- Yeah.

357
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:38,121
- But then we put it on cook mode,

358
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:40,606
it did pressure cooking for five minutes

359
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,550
and that's all it needed

360
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,018
for the chicken to cook
all the way through.

361
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:43,906
It was cooked all the way through,

362
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,185
because we cut it in half,
so it was pretty thin.

363
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,593
And then after that, we put--

364
00:10:47,593 --> 00:10:49,180
- And the veggies were perfect.

365
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,267
- Yeah, the veggies were perfect.

366
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:51,522
- Almost overdone.

367
00:10:51,522 --> 00:10:52,355
- Yeah.

368
00:10:52,355 --> 00:10:55,030
We put corn starch and water in the bottom

369
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,316
of the pot, with all of the oils

370
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,383
that were left over in the liquids

371
00:10:58,383 --> 00:10:59,655
that were left over.

372
00:10:59,655 --> 00:11:01,038
Sauteed that, let it boil,

373
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:01,900
put the chicken back in,

374
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,767
mixed it all together and that's it.

375
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,383
We put it on rice and there you have it.

376
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:08,327
It looks really good.

377
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:09,635
- It could've had more flavor.

378
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:10,866
- Yeah definitely.

379
00:11:10,866 --> 00:11:12,794
But I feel like if we knew exactly

380
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,346
what we're doing, like if
we did this again tomorrow,

381
00:11:15,346 --> 00:11:16,554
it would take about 15 minutes

382
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,234
to do this entire thing.

383
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:19,067
- [Ellie] Yep.

384
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,910
- Maybe less, maybe 10
minutes so it's pretty good.

385
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,796
Definitely I want to experiment more

386
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:25,204
with the Instant Pot.

387
00:11:25,204 --> 00:11:27,956
I feel like breakfasts would be really fun

388
00:11:27,956 --> 00:11:30,653
to experiment with, and
then especially dinners.

389
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:33,117
And I feel like this is a really great

390
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,855
and easy way to cook chicken,

391
00:11:34,855 --> 00:11:37,294
which is like a really healthy meat

392
00:11:37,294 --> 00:11:39,389
that I want to do more of,

393
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:40,605
because you're're always
trying to be healthy.

394
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:41,915
- And I like broccoli, I like broccoli.

395
00:11:41,915 --> 00:11:43,376
- At the beginning of the year.

396
00:11:43,376 --> 00:11:45,990
Yeah, you do like broccoli.

397
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,815
So yay or nay?

398
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:48,696
- Yay.

399
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:49,625
- Yay!

400
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,191
We got the kids to bed
and now it is us time.

401
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,011
It is we time, it is parents time,

402
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,483
it is married time.

403
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:59,485
It's been one year since we've
pulled out the fondue pot

404
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,030
and that means it's been one year

405
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,013
since I've put it together.

406
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,877
So I may be doing this wrong.

407
00:12:05,877 --> 00:12:08,325
I know you're supposed to have a match

408
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:10,581
and this fire gel,

409
00:12:10,581 --> 00:12:14,261
but I feel like there's
a terrible combination

410
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,888
that if something goes wrong,

411
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:17,064
it could blow the house up,

412
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,540
just like the Instant Pot.

413
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,137
We're playing with fire
today Ellie, literally.

414
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:21,970
Okay, ready?

415
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,803
- [Ellie] Yeah.

416
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:25,136
- [Jared] Here goes nothing.

417
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:30,580
That wasn't too bad.

418
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,413
- Awesome.

419
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:33,332
- [Jared] Just got a little
bit of chocolate in there

420
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:34,288
we've got some marshmallows,

421
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:37,276
some shortbread and then
we've got Cullen and Katies'

422
00:12:37,276 --> 00:12:38,652
little Christmas gift.

423
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:41,772
We're gonna dip some bread in Tuscany

424
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:43,643
and what did you say Rosemary?

425
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:44,588
- Parmesan.

426
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:46,834
- [Jared] Parmesan, Tuscany and Parmesan

427
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,251
dipping stuff with some sauce

428
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:51,907
that we'll pour into these bowls.

429
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:54,054
I guess not all of our kids are in bed.

430
00:12:54,054 --> 00:12:55,041
(chill guitar music)

431
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,457
Hi Penny girl.

432
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:59,105
Are you having fun with
your new Christmas present?

433
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:02,605
Huh, are you enjoying that very very much?

434
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:27,437
- [Ellie] Well this is amazing.

435
00:13:27,437 --> 00:13:28,770
This is amazing.

436
00:13:30,253 --> 00:13:33,739
Penny's like please help
me get the treat out.

437
00:13:33,739 --> 00:13:34,580
Look at her.

438
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,804
- She's having a hard time.

439
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:38,284
- [Ellie] Aww, we'll help you a little.

440
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:39,946
She kept going to her place,

441
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:41,328
to the living room and to her place,

442
00:13:41,328 --> 00:13:42,446
trying to like--

443
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,834
- She's like now if I change positions,

444
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,036
maybe I can get this.

445
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:47,483
I'm gonna try over here right now.

446
00:13:47,483 --> 00:13:48,513
- [Ellie] Get it?

447
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:49,947
Oh did it go back in?

448
00:13:49,947 --> 00:13:51,732
- [Jared] Did she push it back in?

449
00:13:51,732 --> 00:13:53,899
Aww Penny, bring it to me.

450
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,005
- She's like okay, one more time?

451
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:59,146
- What would you like to fondue next?

452
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:01,641
(laughing)

453
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,315
- Welcome to a vlog where we
stayed in the kitchen all day.

454
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:05,163
- [Jared] Pretty much, yeah.

455
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:06,843
- This was fun, I loved it.

456
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:07,676
- [Jared] It was fun.

457
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:09,349
- And look how full my belly is.

458
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,946
- [Jared] Aww, it's almost
like you're pregnant.

459
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:12,362
Oh wait, you are.

460
00:14:12,362 --> 00:14:14,549
- [Ellie] I think I'm
like 15 weeks tomorrow.

461
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:17,080
- [Jared] Man these weeks go by so fast.

462
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,913
- Oh my gosh.

463
00:14:17,913 --> 00:14:19,810
I was talking to Bonnie today,

464
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,025
'cause we were talking about something

465
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:22,715
and I was like oh I can
just suck my belly in

466
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:25,336
and I was like, oh I can't.

467
00:14:25,336 --> 00:14:26,169
It's still there.

468
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:28,257
And we laughed so hard.

469
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:29,324
'Cause you know how, when
you're first pregnant,

470
00:14:29,324 --> 00:14:31,379
it's kind of like a food baby in a way.

471
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:32,590
You just suck it in and it's gone,

472
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:34,081
It's like oh, just kidding,

473
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,549
it's a legit babe now.
- Can't do that anymore.

474
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:37,382
- [Jared] Yeah.

475
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:38,285
Oh my goodness gracious.

476
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:39,118
- What?

477
00:14:39,118 --> 00:14:41,217
- Seeing your face right
through this camera

478
00:14:41,217 --> 00:14:45,148
with your hand on your chin
like that takes me back.

479
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:47,565
It takes me back to when hoo,

480
00:14:48,443 --> 00:14:51,066
I was doing my hip surgery recovery

481
00:14:51,066 --> 00:14:55,011
and I was on my hospital
bed in my grandma's house,

482
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,133
that I stayed for three months.

483
00:14:57,133 --> 00:14:59,149
And you came almost every single day

484
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,102
while I was recovering.

485
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,785
- [Ellie] I left hair school early.

486
00:15:01,785 --> 00:15:02,710
- Mmm-hmm, you did.

487
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,892
But there was one picture

488
00:15:04,892 --> 00:15:07,559
I took on my Palm Trio 650 and--

489
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:10,247
- [Ellie] I was doing that.

490
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:11,142
- Yeah, you were doing that.

491
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:13,605
And you look identical to that.

492
00:15:13,605 --> 00:15:14,861
I want to see if I can find that picture

493
00:15:14,861 --> 00:15:15,955
and I'll put it in here if I can.

494
00:15:15,955 --> 00:15:16,899
- What?

495
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,124
- [Jared] But yeah,
you're just so beautiful

496
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:18,958
and pretty and it just,

497
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:19,791
- Thanks.

498
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,894
- [Jared] It took me back.

499
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,102
- We had so much fun.

500
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:26,711
That's seriously, we fell
in love just talking.

501
00:15:26,711 --> 00:15:30,399
- We fell in love during
my hip surgery recovery.

502
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,417
It's kind of embarrassing,
but it's also kind of sweet.

503
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,345
- It's cute.

504
00:15:33,345 --> 00:15:35,646
Like we really didn't even,

505
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:36,896
we didn't kiss.

506
00:15:37,846 --> 00:15:39,006
I'd say goodbye.

507
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:41,603
- Because my grandma and Mom
and Dad were right there.

508
00:15:41,603 --> 00:15:43,983
- Well yeah and it's
like you were like sick,

509
00:15:43,983 --> 00:15:46,191
you were in bed sick,

510
00:15:46,191 --> 00:15:48,463
so instead of kissing, we talked,

511
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:49,631
like normal people.

512
00:15:49,631 --> 00:15:52,290
- Yeah, I was bedridden for three months.

513
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:55,537
Like that was hard, that was
a difficult time, you know?

514
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,419
- What was your favorite food

515
00:15:56,419 --> 00:15:58,558
when you were bedridden?

516
00:15:58,558 --> 00:15:59,670
Did you like soup?

517
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,881
You didn't like much food at all.

518
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:02,369
- Yeah I didn't like food at all.

519
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:05,786
I remember one day I craved ribs or steak

520
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:09,041
and I threw it all up,

521
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,135
- [Ellie] Oh!

522
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,215
- because it was just way too much for me.

523
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:16,592
But soups and jello and
those kinds of things,

524
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:19,316
that's all I could put down and eat.

525
00:16:19,316 --> 00:16:21,407
Everything else was just too much.

526
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,392
- We were just babies.

527
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,312
We still are.

528
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:26,029
I still feel weird.
- We are.

529
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:29,793
- Yeah, is it weird that in my head,

530
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:31,233
so I'm 29 years old,

531
00:16:31,233 --> 00:16:32,569
but in my head I still feel like

532
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:35,600
I'm 18 or 22 or something like that.

533
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,263
I guess maybe that's what 29 feels like,

534
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,464
but in my head it's just like,

535
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:41,767
I don't feel any different in my head

536
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,609
than I did when I was 22.

537
00:16:43,609 --> 00:16:45,986
- Oh yeah, that's why
sometimes I feel weird.

538
00:16:45,986 --> 00:16:47,874
I feel like I'm still yeah,

539
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,118
like 16.
