1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,000
- I can't believe this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,833
Run away!

3
00:00:04,647 --> 00:00:06,296
- I can't believe the snow.

4
00:00:06,296 --> 00:00:08,479
(laughing)

5
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:11,062
(gentle music)

6
00:00:28,804 --> 00:00:30,070
- I'm sick.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,316
- [Ellie] Does your head hurt?

8
00:00:31,316 --> 00:00:32,149
- Mmm-hmm.

9
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:33,728
- [Ellie] Does your tummy hurt?

10
00:00:33,728 --> 00:00:34,561
- No.

11
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,810
- [Ellie] Just your head?

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,720
- I'm sorry bud.

13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,580
- [Ellie] You've been so clingy to Dad.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,630
- I know I love it.

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,815
He follows me everywhere I go.

16
00:00:43,815 --> 00:00:47,113
(Ellie laughs)

17
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,363
(laughing)

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,210
They're changing Mario's clothes

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:54,480
on the game, on Mario Odyssey.

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,990
- [Ellie] Calvin just laid
his head down and fell asleep.

21
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,940
(Ellie laughs)

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,709
- Remember a couple days ago when I said,

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:07,590
gosh, I wish it would just
either snow or not snow.

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,340
I'm pretty sure the
snow's made up its mind.

25
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,830
You can probably tell from
the reflection in the window.

26
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,360
We have a crap ton of snow.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,000
And I brought my tape measure out to see.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,320
This is ridiculous.

29
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,180
Oh my gosh.

30
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,210
It was raining at about
eight o'clock this morning

31
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,840
and I think it started
snowing around nine o'clock,

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,610
it's two o'clock right now,

33
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,197
so it hasn't even been that long.

34
00:01:28,197 --> 00:01:30,600
And we have the hot tub
storage right here, with snow.

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,810
And let's see, nine inches on the dot.

36
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,230
So more than an inch an hour

37
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,220
is what we've been getting with snow.

38
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,400
This is absolutely ridiculous.

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,440
I kinda love it, I kinda hate it.

40
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,100
I have a love hate relationship with snow,

41
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,040
but I'm gonna learn to love it right now.

42
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,390
Yes Mr. Four-Wheeler, it's
time we take you for a spin

43
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,820
and use you to the best of our abilities.

44
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,820
I love this thing.

45
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,020
This is the coolest attachment
for the four-wheeler,

46
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,853
is the plow.

47
00:01:57,853 --> 00:02:00,210
It makes shoveling nine inches of snow

48
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,980
from the driveway, oh so much nicer.

49
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:05,590
Look at that, so much freaking snow.

50
00:02:06,906 --> 00:02:08,439
(engine starting)

51
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:10,036
Thank goodness, woo.

52
00:02:10,036 --> 00:02:11,240
I was nervous for a second.

53
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,100
Last time this happened,

54
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,013
it didn't start for a long long time.

55
00:02:14,013 --> 00:02:16,596
(bright music)

56
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
Okay, I have to say this
is kind of ridiculous.

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,605
This amount of snowfall is crazy.

58
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:37,440
I just finished, and now
I need to start again.

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,273
See that?

60
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:39,380
That scrape right here?

61
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,100
I did that one minute ago.

62
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,140
That stuff, all through here,

63
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,500
that's was when I very first started.

64
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,280
Like oh my gosh, I have to start

65
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,300
all the way over again.

66
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,530
This is so much snow.

67
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,870
This is crazy.

68
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:51,830
Should we go skiing tomorrow?

69
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,940
That might be fun.

70
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,580
- [Ellie] Alright guys, Penny's out.

71
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,920
Oh my goodness, we got a foot.

72
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,490
Look at her trot through that snow, wow.

73
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,690
It's all fresh snow

74
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,970
that she gets to run in for a minute.

75
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,340
Holy cow.

76
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,914
- This is awesome.

77
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:09,747
- [Ellie] Crazy.

78
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:10,580
- It's crazy awesome.

79
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,020
Hey, well what do you think, huh?

80
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,900
What do you think of our robot?

81
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,960
What do you think, are you kinda scared?

82
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,110
Is that why you're
coming right next to me?

83
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,310
Don't worry Penny,

84
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,750
it's not gonna do anything.

85
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,630
It's just vacuuming.

86
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,060
Oh it's hiding from ya.

87
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,893
It's hiding from ya.

88
00:03:23,893 --> 00:03:25,920
Oh she's hiding, she's hiding.

89
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,010
There it is.
(vacuum humming)

90
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,232
There it is Penny, go get it.

91
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,470
There it is, go get it.

92
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:32,690
(Jared laughs)

93
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:34,440
She has no idea what to do with it.

94
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,350
That's so funny.

95
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,183
There you go.

96
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:40,528
Oh watch out Penny, it's coming!

97
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:42,549
(louder humming)

98
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:43,565
(Jared laughs)

99
00:03:43,565 --> 00:03:44,761
(Jared barking)

100
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:45,951
(Jared laughing)

101
00:03:45,951 --> 00:03:46,784
- Did she get scared?

102
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,366
- I scared her.

103
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:51,350
I'm sorry, I'm such a mean dad.

104
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:52,860
Am I a mean dog dad Penny?

105
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,478
Woo, watch out!

106
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:55,990
- [Ellie] Yeah it has little, Penny go.

107
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,020
- [Jared] It has little bristles.

108
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,030
- [Ellie] She's trying to find the food

109
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,750
before the vacuum does.

110
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,350
- [Jared] It's a race,
who's gonna find it first?

111
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,570
Who's gonna clean it up first?

112
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,780
Penny's sniffing around the corner.

113
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,310
She's not finding it.

114
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,240
- I love my Valentine present.

115
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,340
Thank you Jared.
- You're welcome.

116
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,740
- Well it's for me too.

117
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,600
I didn't want to vacuum,

118
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,130
so I had the robot do it.

119
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,930
I can't believe this.

120
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,220
I know all we've talked about today

121
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,810
is being sick and the snow,

122
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,240
but this is incredible.

123
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,820
Look at all the snow.

124
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,300
You know what we're gonna do boys?

125
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,070
If you're feeling better tomorrow,

126
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:30,433
we are going to play all day in the snow.

127
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,266
- All day long?

128
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:32,410
- [Jared] All day long.

129
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,413
Does that sound fun?

130
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:34,246
- Yeah.

131
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:35,079
- Yeah?

132
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,560
Maybe we can put the
sled on the four-wheeler

133
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,000
and we can drive around on the sled

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,140
and all that good stuff.

135
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,730
It's almost like Christmas, isn't it?

136
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:41,820
- Yeah.

137
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,748
- [Jared] Yeah, do you
like the snow Calvin?

138
00:04:43,748 --> 00:04:44,581
- Yeah.

139
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,414
- [Jared] Should we play in it tomorrow

140
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,480
if you feel better?

141
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,313
- Yeah.

142
00:04:47,313 --> 00:04:48,146
- Okay.

143
00:04:48,146 --> 00:04:48,979
(beeping)
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

144
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,910
It's a bomb, run away!

145
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,913
Are we safe?

146
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:56,914
Good.

147
00:04:56,914 --> 00:04:58,674
Phew, that was a close one.

148
00:04:58,674 --> 00:05:00,440
- I can't believe the snow.

149
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,350
- [Jared] I know, isn't that so crazy?

150
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,230
Look at how much snow is on the hot tub.

151
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,152
- [Jackson] Whoa.

152
00:05:05,152 --> 00:05:06,610
- [Jared] Whoa is right.

153
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,970
- I'm hungry.

154
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,781
- [Jared] Oh yay, you're hungry.

155
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:12,198
- I'm gonna get dinner, waa!

156
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:19,205
- Yes yes, wear your
energy thin, get tired.

157
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:23,790
Wear your energy out, it's almost bedtime.

158
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,460
Keep running my child, run!

159
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:29,053
- I'm gonna go watch TV waa!

160
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,136
(laughs)

161
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,690
- A parent's greatest dream come true.

162
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,910
When the kids wear
themselves out before bed.

163
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:41,540
T minus 15 minutes until
Jackson will be fast asleep.

164
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,180
6:51, let's time it.

165
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,120
Hit the clock.

166
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,200
30 minutes later, they are asleep.

167
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,080
It took about 30 minutes,

168
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,910
because we were reading stories

169
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,080
and I'm saying goodnight and everything

170
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,770
and then they went upstairs, fell asleep.

171
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,500
Honestly, I feel good
about the sleeping stuff.

172
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,930
You guys have heard this all before,

173
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,200
but I love the way that
we're doing things,

174
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,580
because it helps them and it helps Ellie,

175
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,420
especially while she's pregnant.

176
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,080
That is the biggest thing for her.

177
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,920
We had a hard time,

178
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,680
because Calvin and Jackson were coming up

179
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,020
in our bedroom in the middle of the night

180
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,110
and it would make us not sleep.

181
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,800
But now, they're sleeping
through the night,

182
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,810
Ellie's sleeping all the
way through the night,

183
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,540
except for a couple times
when she has to wake up

184
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,270
to go pee, because you
know, pregnancy stuff,

185
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,546
but it's good, I love going to bed now.

186
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:24,440
(laughs)

187
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,810
So I just took a peak at the video

188
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,830
that we uploaded today,

189
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,770
which is us talking about baby names

190
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,620
and Ellie, I'm so happy to
let you know that I think--

191
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,071
- Shark Dee Dee is the name?

192
00:06:33,071 --> 00:06:33,904
- [Jared] I think we're gonna call

193
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:35,230
our baby Cody Shark Dee Dee.

194
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,070
- What about Cody Olivia
Boston Lincoln Shark Dee Dee?

195
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,780
Because that's Jackson's new name.

196
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,070
- That was Jackson's new name.

197
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,650
We were sitting down for dinner tonight

198
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,040
and Jackson was like I don't
like Cody Shark Dee Dee.

199
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,500
I like Cody Boston Olivia
Lincoln Dee Dee, Shark Dee Dee.

200
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,600
So I'm sorry guys, that's
gonna be the name officially.

201
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,681
Official, from us to
you, baby name reveal.

202
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:57,514
(laughs)

203
00:06:57,514 --> 00:06:58,990
Can you believe it, like
where does he get this?

204
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,823
- He's crazy.

205
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,420
- [Jared] Where does he get Shark Dee Dee?

206
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,910
- He thinks it's cute.

207
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,360
He made it up and laughed.
- I guess, yeah.

208
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,901
- [Jared] That's the funniest thing.

209
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,870
- Ah, I'm getting flustered.

210
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:09,340
- [Jared] What are you
getting flustered with?

211
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,460
- I'm looking at places to
go with the kids and Penny

212
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,520
in our camper.
- Uh-huh.

213
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,980
- [Jared] Somewhere
where there's not a foot

214
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,870
and a half of snow outside?

215
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,020
- Somewhere where it's kind of warm,

216
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,490
but we don't want to go too far.

217
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,786
- [Jared] You know where I want to go?

218
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:21,619
- Where?

219
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:22,840
- I want to go someplace warm,

220
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,470
where the beer flows like wine

221
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,780
and the women instinctively flock

222
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,420
like the salmon of Capistrano.

223
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,330
Ellie, I'm talking about
a place called Aspen.

224
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,560
- Sounds too cold for me there.

225
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,810
- Yeah, well I heard the French are--

226
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,980
I'm sorry, I can't finish that quote.

227
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,168
- Goodbye.

228
00:07:38,168 --> 00:07:39,001
(Jared laughs)

229
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,170
- I get on movie quotes

230
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,783
and Ellie doesn't like the movie quotes.

231
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,149
- [Ellie] I do too,

232
00:07:44,149 --> 00:07:45,101
I'm just thinking.
- Okay.

233
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:46,337
- You're just thinking.

234
00:07:46,337 --> 00:07:47,400
- [Ellie] Help me.

235
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,233
- Okay.

236
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,660
- I've texted you a thousand things.

237
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,370
- You have, that's true.

238
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,750
I've been playing video games,

239
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,990
so time to put the video games away

240
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:56,310
and time to help my pregnant wife.

241
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,810
Geez Jared, why haven't you been helping

242
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,820
your pregnant wife?

243
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,460
Come on, come outside.

244
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,580
Hey you, yeah you.

245
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,520
Have you been enjoying the snow?

246
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,530
Yeah, you've been enjoying the snow?

247
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:07,680
You ready for bed though?

248
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,900
Yeah, you're ready for bed.

249
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,650
She has been having tons of fun.

250
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,760
She has been running up and down the fence

251
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,690
with the neighbor dogs.

252
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,030
She has been pile driving her nose

253
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:18,520
into the snow and tunneling underneath it.

254
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,930
She is a lab through and through.

255
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,260
Well guys, that's it for us tonight.

256
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Calvin, I hope you feel better.

257
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,120
Jackson, (snaps) you're doing great.

258
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,760
And Ellie, I don't
think she's been feeling

259
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,593
all that great too.

260
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,740
I think she's catching what they have too,

261
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,690
but we are going to take it easy

262
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,919
and get on the mend

263
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,169
over the next couple days,

264
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,379
so thank you guys for watching.

265
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,419
If you enjoyed the video,

266
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,729
give it a big thumbs up

267
00:08:39,730 --> 00:00:00,000
and we will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
