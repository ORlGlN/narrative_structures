1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,826
Joel and I are taking a taxi alone

2
00:00:01,826 --> 00:00:03,266
for the very first time.
Guy's trip.

3
00:00:03,266 --> 00:00:05,971
(chuckles) We're going
to DJI, we've never been,

4
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,053
we've never called a taxi.

5
00:00:07,053 --> 00:00:10,638
We've never done this
before, so here's to hoping

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:12,392
we get to where we want
to go for the first time.

7
00:00:12,392 --> 00:00:13,433
We're gonna make it.

8
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,611
Score one for the Americans, we did it!

9
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:16,852
We're here.
Amazing Race, here we come.

10
00:00:16,852 --> 00:00:17,898
I know, right?

11
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:19,348
We should do The Amazing Race.

12
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:20,643
We're gonna, this is it.

13
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:23,058
I think we're amazing, and we were racing.

14
00:00:23,058 --> 00:00:24,096
- [Joel] Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:24,096 --> 00:00:24,929
Amazing Race.

16
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,770
Our flight today leaves in a few hours,

17
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,455
but we wanted to make one
more stop before we left.

18
00:00:30,455 --> 00:00:31,872
Joel and I are...

19
00:00:33,705 --> 00:00:34,538
- [Joel] DJI.

20
00:00:34,538 --> 00:00:35,783
Visiting a cool company today.

21
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:37,408
I feel like I'm a kid in a candy store.

22
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:38,296
I really, really do.

23
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:40,583
Like, look, they've got the drones,

24
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:43,426
they've got all the
history of all of DJI here.

25
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:44,641
I wanna show you this one here,

26
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,068
this is blowing my mind.

27
00:00:46,068 --> 00:00:48,779
This is the Flame Wheel, this is like

28
00:00:48,779 --> 00:00:50,527
the first drone that they made.

29
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:52,187
It was like a kit that you put together.

30
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,898
It wasn't even out of the
box, you just fly the drone.

31
00:00:54,898 --> 00:00:57,867
And that was in 2012, like five years ago.

32
00:00:57,867 --> 00:00:59,711
That's where drones were.

33
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:02,930
And they've got all their new
stuff out here on the front.

34
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,114
Like these, this giant drone, the Osmos,

35
00:01:06,114 --> 00:01:09,457
the Ronins, the Sparks, the DJI Goggles,

36
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:14,113
the Mavic, the Inspire 2,
the Obsidian Phantom 4 Pro.

37
00:01:14,113 --> 00:01:17,729
This is so crazy, but what
blows my mind the most...

38
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:20,996
We are the first American
creators to be here.

39
00:01:20,996 --> 00:01:22,243
The first ones.

40
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:24,695
No other creator, like YouTuber, has been

41
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:29,218
in this DJI place, this
building, except Joel and I.

42
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,725
And so they're telling us, they're like,

43
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:33,437
that means a lot to us,
so thank you for coming.

44
00:01:33,437 --> 00:01:35,298
I was like, "Oh my gosh, this is so cool,

45
00:01:35,298 --> 00:01:36,329
"we're coming again."

46
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,499
But, ah, this is awesome.

47
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,002
Even when we had a translator,

48
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,815
sometimes it just would
get lost in translation,

49
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:45,837
especially when we went
to fast food places.

50
00:01:45,837 --> 00:01:49,460
I'm very particular when
it comes to my hamburgers.

51
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,206
I just like ketchup, cheese, and lettuce.

52
00:01:51,206 --> 00:01:53,660
And so I got a Whopper, and I told them

53
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,897
no pickles, no tomatoes, no mayonnaise.

54
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:58,980
Just ketchup and lettuce.

55
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:02,592
And so, it's like an unboxing video,

56
00:02:02,592 --> 00:02:03,728
I'm like, super excited to see

57
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:05,964
what actually showed up on here.

58
00:02:05,964 --> 00:02:08,083
But what I love about watching Jared

59
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,430
is no matter where he has gone,

60
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,262
you have always made them laugh.

61
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:12,157
(Jared laughs)

62
00:02:12,157 --> 00:02:13,509
So either they're laughing at you,

63
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,508
but I think they were--
I have no idea.

64
00:02:15,508 --> 00:02:17,533
- [Ellie] But I think they
were totally laughing with you.

65
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,013
'Cause you guys high-fived.

66
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,314
- [Jared] Ah, look at that!

67
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:22,364
- [Ellie] Awesome!

68
00:02:22,364 --> 00:02:23,197
They're perfect.

69
00:02:23,197 --> 00:02:24,104
There's no lettuce,
but I'm okay with that.

70
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:24,937
(Ellie chuckles)

71
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:25,804
That works great.

72
00:02:25,804 --> 00:02:27,449
You know what you do,
here's the thing you do.

73
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:29,727
Take some fries, throw it on there.

74
00:02:29,727 --> 00:02:31,213
- [Bonnie] Layer it up.
- [Jared] Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:31,213 --> 00:02:32,858
- [Joel] So they still
got your order wrong?

76
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:33,691
A little bit.

77
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:34,524
You know what that makes me feel like?

78
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:35,357
- [Jared] What?

79
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:36,190
I'm back in the States.

80
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,366
(Jared laughs)

81
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:40,533
(bright guitar music)

82
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:44,294
Done with one plane, onto the next!

83
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:47,213
Well, after we wait for six hours.

84
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:49,964
We have a six hour layover.

85
00:02:49,964 --> 00:02:50,797
Here we go!

86
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:51,630
Six hours!

87
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,163
Six hours.

88
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:54,369
Bye bye!

89
00:02:54,369 --> 00:02:56,074
[SpongeBob Narrator] Six hours later.

90
00:02:56,074 --> 00:02:58,657
(guitar music)

91
00:03:12,369 --> 00:03:13,619
Good morning!

92
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:16,869
I am with my babies!

93
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:19,575
I'm gonna still crack some eggs.

94
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:20,789
- [Ellie] You wanna crack more?

95
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:21,622
Yeah.

96
00:03:21,622 --> 00:03:22,455
- [Ellie] Let's, I think--

97
00:03:22,455 --> 00:03:25,742
Oh, oop, did you tootie? (chuckles)

98
00:03:25,742 --> 00:03:27,035
I don't think we need anymore.

99
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:28,191
Can you mix it a little more?

100
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,310
And then we'll make them.

101
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,715
We'll make the pancakes.

102
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:32,381
Last night when Jared and I got home,

103
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:34,063
both the boys woke up.

104
00:03:34,063 --> 00:03:36,016
Calvin's over there playing toys.

105
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:40,317
And they slept in our
bed, and it was so fun

106
00:03:40,317 --> 00:03:41,964
greeting them last night.

107
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:46,615
We cuddled, we talked, we told
them how much we missed them,

108
00:03:46,615 --> 00:03:49,052
and then they woke up
pretty early this morning,

109
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,169
so we're making pancakes.

110
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,210
Yeah, for me!

111
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:54,043
Um, um, um!

112
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:55,177
(Ellie laughs)

113
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:56,353
- [Ellie] For you.

114
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,499
And then we'll go wake Daddy up

115
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,320
when we're done eating, 'kay?

116
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,473
You bring something cool for me?

117
00:04:03,473 --> 00:04:05,985
We did, we told Jackson, we called him,

118
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,112
and Calvin, he's over there playing.

119
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:10,144
I said we'll bring you something,

120
00:04:10,144 --> 00:04:11,879
I want you to be really good
for Grandma and Grandpa,

121
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:13,086
and guess what?

122
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:13,919
What?

123
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,065
- [Ellie] You were so good.

124
00:04:16,065 --> 00:04:19,525
You'd go to bed, and
you listened good, huh?

125
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,115
Do you think you were good?

126
00:04:21,115 --> 00:04:22,616
What did you bring me?

127
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:24,346
- [Ellie] Let's eat,
and then we'll show you.

128
00:04:24,346 --> 00:04:25,179
'Kay?
Okay.

129
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,394
- [Ellie] 'Kay.

130
00:04:26,394 --> 00:04:28,144
I missed you so much!

131
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,460
Oh, some of them fell out.

132
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,430
- [Ellie] That's okay.

133
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,347
Calvin, hi.

134
00:04:35,445 --> 00:04:36,278
Hi.

135
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:40,987
- [Ellie] (chuckles) Did
you help me break eggs?

136
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,529
Did you break the eggs with us?

137
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:44,374
Yeah.

138
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:45,373
- [Ellie] Yeah, should we eat?

139
00:04:45,373 --> 00:04:46,701
Yeah.
- [Ellie] Okay.

140
00:04:46,701 --> 00:04:48,951
Do you wanna wake Daddy up?

141
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,266
Let's go wake him up, but be really nice.

142
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,333
- [Jackson] Daddy.

143
00:04:59,636 --> 00:05:00,966
- [Ellie] Go get Dad.

144
00:05:00,966 --> 00:05:04,768
- [Jackson] Dad, I want
you to show me the prize.

145
00:05:04,768 --> 00:05:05,601
(Ellie laughs)

146
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:06,434
- [Jared] You do?

147
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:08,047
Good morning, guys.

148
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:08,984
- [Jackson] Good morning.

149
00:05:08,984 --> 00:05:11,901
We just ate pancakes for breakfast.

150
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:14,867
- [Jared] You did?

151
00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:15,916
Was it so good?

152
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,441
Yeah.

153
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:19,136
Can I see the prize now?

154
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,414
- [Jared] You want the
surprise so bad, don't you?

155
00:05:21,414 --> 00:05:22,979
- [Ellie] He waited so long, huh?

156
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,216
- [Jared] Yes he did.

157
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:25,559
- [Ellie] Look, I wanna show what Jackson

158
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,382
made us while we were gone.

159
00:05:27,382 --> 00:05:29,116
- [Jared] Look at Calvin look at my face.

160
00:05:29,116 --> 00:05:31,296
(Ellie laughs)

161
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,629
Dad, Dad, Dad.

162
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,089
Dad, we drawed your name.

163
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:39,050
- [Jared] You did? Oh my goodness.

164
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,576
Look, Grandma and Grandpa.
- [Jared] That's so good.

165
00:05:41,576 --> 00:05:43,005
It was Grandma Griffi--

166
00:05:43,005 --> 00:05:44,255
Grandma Mecham.

167
00:05:45,137 --> 00:05:46,598
- [Jared] Where's Daddy?

168
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:49,463
I didn't draw you.
- [Jared] Oh, okay.

169
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,621
- [Ellie] But where's Mama?

170
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:53,514
Right here.

171
00:05:53,514 --> 00:05:56,360
- [Ellie] (gasps) It's so good!

172
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,309
Don't rip it!

173
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:59,190
(Ellie and Jared chuckle)

174
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,321
- [Calvin] Mommy.

175
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,378
- [Jared] Yeah, that's Mommy.

176
00:06:02,378 --> 00:06:04,086
- [Jackson] Can we put this away for you?

177
00:06:04,086 --> 00:06:05,340
- [Ellie] Yes, thank you.

178
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,372
Now, I wanna get my prize now!

179
00:06:07,372 --> 00:06:08,299
Okay.

180
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:09,712
Yay!

181
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:11,173
(Ellie laughs)

182
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:13,108
- [Ellie] Are you gonna
bring me something?

183
00:06:13,108 --> 00:06:14,275
- [Calvin] My!

184
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:19,343
- [Ellie] (chuckles) Stay here.

185
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:21,369
Are you just waiting patiently?

186
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:22,202
Mm-hmm.

187
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:23,111
(Ellie laughs)

188
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:24,992
That's Jackson's favorite thing to do,

189
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:26,438
is just close his eyes.

190
00:06:26,438 --> 00:06:27,855
Wait, gotta wait.

191
00:06:28,695 --> 00:06:30,122
Close your eyes!

192
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,930
We've got a few surprises.

193
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,457
Don't you sneak peek,
don't you sneak peek!

194
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:36,559
We've got a few surprises for ya.

195
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:37,842
- [Jackson] (gasps) Me?

196
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:39,879
So Mommy and Daddy, we went to a village

197
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,245
when we were on the boat.

198
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:43,030
Do you remember when we were on the boat?

199
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,829
And they make things there...

200
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:45,662
(Calvin babbles)

201
00:06:45,662 --> 00:06:47,432
and we saw some things
that we think you'd like,

202
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:48,502
so I want to show you those first.

203
00:06:48,502 --> 00:06:49,608
- [Jackson] Okay.

204
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:50,441
Ready?

205
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:51,516
- [Jackson] Yep.

206
00:06:51,516 --> 00:06:53,068
Open your eyes.

207
00:06:53,068 --> 00:06:54,234
What?!

208
00:06:54,234 --> 00:06:55,354
- [Jared] Do you know what these are?

209
00:06:55,354 --> 00:06:57,232
- [Jackson] Yeah, drums!

210
00:06:57,232 --> 00:06:58,082
- [Jared] Yeah.

211
00:06:58,082 --> 00:07:00,249
(patting)

212
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,891
- [Ellie] Is that cool,
that they made this.

213
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:04,950
- [Jared] Yeah, they made that.

214
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,827
- [Ellie] See all that on there?

215
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:08,662
(Calvin babbles)

216
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:11,145
This is something really cool.

217
00:07:11,145 --> 00:07:12,792
- [Jackson] What is that?

218
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,571
This is a flute.

219
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,321
(flute whistles)

220
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,577
You did it.

221
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,567
You can try--

222
00:07:23,705 --> 00:07:24,538
Oh!

223
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,979
(flute whistles)

224
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,621
Yay!

225
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:30,879
Don't blow too hard.

226
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,212
(Ellie and Jared laugh)

227
00:07:37,234 --> 00:07:38,574
- [Jared] Jackson, when we saw this,

228
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:39,786
we thought of you and we thought

229
00:07:39,786 --> 00:07:42,076
you would love it so, so much, 'kay?

230
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,192
'Kay.

231
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:46,040
- [Jared] Ready?
- [Jackson] Yep.

232
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,678
Bum ba da bum.

233
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:48,664
- [Jackson] What?!

234
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:50,767
(Ellie and Jared chuckle)

235
00:07:50,767 --> 00:07:51,931
Look.
What is this?!

236
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:55,636
This is a remote control
car that is Spider-Man

237
00:07:55,636 --> 00:07:57,636
on one side, and look...

238
00:07:59,108 --> 00:08:01,647
Captain America on the other.

239
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,313
Is this the Spider-Man?

240
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:06,257
Uh-huh, and look, it can
go up walls like that,

241
00:08:06,257 --> 00:08:08,532
and it'll flip over, and you keep driving.

242
00:08:08,532 --> 00:08:11,370
(gasps) My dog?

243
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,722
Yeah, it's a dog for you, that's right.

244
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:16,769
This is a nightlight for your bedroom.

245
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:19,642
- [Jackson] Oh, it a
nightlight just like mine.

246
00:08:19,642 --> 00:08:23,142
Yeah, and it's a doggy, but look, watch.

247
00:08:24,026 --> 00:08:25,321
You see it light up?

248
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:27,252
Look.
- [Ellie] Whoa.

249
00:08:27,252 --> 00:08:28,560
- [Jared] Do you see that?

250
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,002
- [Jackson] It glows up too?

251
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:31,252
- [Jared] Yeah.

252
00:08:32,711 --> 00:08:34,577
- [Ellie] Oh, you see
the Spider-Man glowing?

253
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:37,071
We missed you boys so, so much.

254
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:37,921
(muah)

255
00:08:37,921 --> 00:08:40,489
We are so happy (muah) to be home.

256
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,927
We love you, love you, love you, love you!

257
00:08:41,927 --> 00:08:43,450
- [Ellie] I can't wait to hear about all

258
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,663
about their trip.

259
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:47,583
That's kind of fun, if Mom and Dad leave,

260
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,359
especially for a long time, to come home

261
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:53,526
with some fun gifts, huh? (laughs)

262
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,583
(flute whistles)

263
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,474
- [Jackson] Dad, let's
go get some batteries.

264
00:08:58,474 --> 00:08:59,387
- [Jared] Okay.

265
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:00,594
- [Ellie] Hey, do you like that?

266
00:09:00,594 --> 00:09:01,427
Yeah.

267
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:02,426
- [Ellie] Let's hear it.

268
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,706
Oh, did you hit your eye?

269
00:09:03,706 --> 00:09:06,267
Yeah.
- [Ellie] Owie.

270
00:09:06,267 --> 00:09:08,799
(flute whistles)

271
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,148
When Jackson woke up, he was on the couch,

272
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:15,856
and loved on us, loved us
hugging and kissing him.

273
00:09:15,856 --> 00:09:19,581
And then Calvin had woke up in his room,

274
00:09:19,581 --> 00:09:22,016
and when I walked in he...

275
00:09:22,016 --> 00:09:24,614
And then he put his hand
up, and touched my face.

276
00:09:24,614 --> 00:09:26,845
And I was like, "Mama's home."

277
00:09:26,845 --> 00:09:28,320
(both laugh)

278
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,410
Yeah, Jackson was so sweet
because the first thing

279
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:33,254
he said, he said, "Do you
have a surprise for me?"

280
00:09:33,254 --> 00:09:34,154
And I said yes.

281
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:35,646
'Cause we would, we
told him if he was good,

282
00:09:35,646 --> 00:09:36,479
we'd bring one.

283
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:38,831
And I said, "Let's wait until
we wake up in the morning."

284
00:09:38,831 --> 00:09:39,839
He said, "Okay."

285
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,672
(Ellie laughs)

286
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:42,473
So mature, he didn't want it right then,

287
00:09:42,473 --> 00:09:43,922
he's like, "I just want to hold you."

288
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:46,520
And he just hugged us, and oh!

289
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,537
So we all slept over in our bed,

290
00:09:48,537 --> 00:09:51,842
and then they woke up at the
butt crack of dawn. (laughs)

291
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:53,642
How are you feeling?

292
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,958
I was really tired when I woke up,

293
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,149
I feel like I'm pretty good now.

294
00:09:57,149 --> 00:09:58,499
- [Ellie] Yeah, yeah.

295
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,659
But yeah, I'm glad that we got home,

296
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:02,402
and we were able to go straight to bed.

297
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,314
- [Ellie] Yeah.

298
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:06,106
And slept for six hours,
so I feel like that's

299
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,642
going to help us quite
a bit with the jet lag.

300
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,787
Awesome. We're home!

301
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:12,002
We went to China, and now we're back!

302
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:14,252
(drumming)

303
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,555
So Grandma Griffiths just called me.

304
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:23,441
Oh, don't eat my hoodie! (chuckles)

305
00:10:23,441 --> 00:10:24,559
And guess what she said?

306
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,392
Hmm?

307
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,352
She said that yesterday in the car,

308
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:29,600
that Calvin was crying in
the car, and he was tired,

309
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,065
and he was saying, "Mama!"

310
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:34,498
Your lip was quivered, and
you were starting to cry.

311
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,314
And he said, "It's okay, Calvin.

312
00:10:36,314 --> 00:10:38,726
"Mom and Dad will be home soon."

313
00:10:38,726 --> 00:10:42,430
And was like trying not
to cry, did that happen?

314
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,668
You were so brave for Calvin.

315
00:10:45,668 --> 00:10:47,236
I'm proud of you.

316
00:10:47,236 --> 00:10:49,235
Thank you for taking care of him.

317
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:50,068
Mm-hmm.

318
00:10:52,393 --> 00:10:53,919
And this is pretty much
what we've done all day.

319
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,441
We've kissed, we've been
eating, he's eating cereal,

320
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,622
dry cereal right now.

321
00:10:59,622 --> 00:11:00,849
This is what we've been doing.

322
00:11:00,849 --> 00:11:03,508
We've been home, it's in the evening now,

323
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:07,636
and it is like in the
morning-ish in China.

324
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:09,415
So, it's like completely flip-flopped.

325
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:14,317
And I have felt much better
than I thought I would.

326
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:16,757
We're obviously really tired,
because our time change

327
00:11:16,757 --> 00:11:19,059
has totally been flipped,
we just traveled 30 hours,

328
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:22,226
just getting off of, like, being busy.

329
00:11:23,415 --> 00:11:25,596
But I feel better than I thought I would.

330
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:28,342
Especially now that it's
getting more into the evening.

331
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:31,070
Around noon and one I was really sluggish,

332
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:33,932
didn't want to do laundry,
but knew I had to get it done.

333
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:35,840
We had like no underwear.

334
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,370
So we're washing loads of
laundry, we're cuddling, kissing.

335
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,730
It's just been a really good day back.

336
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,238
Jared has more energy than he should.

337
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,704
There's a mess in the kitchen.

338
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:49,280
Or in the living room, on the carpet.

339
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,934
I think it's water, so I think
we're okay. (Ellie laughs)

340
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:52,673
But I can't tell, I need your nose.

341
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:54,330
It might be juice.

342
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:59,225
Jared's parents came over
today for us to talk about...

343
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:01,195
Well, let's see, where's the juice?

344
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:02,335
(gasps) There it is.

345
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,726
- [Jared] He's standing on it!

346
00:12:03,726 --> 00:12:05,869
He's trying to cover
up his tracks. (laughs)

347
00:12:05,869 --> 00:12:07,036
- [Ellie] Where's the bottle?

348
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,412
- [Jared] I can't find it.

349
00:12:08,412 --> 00:12:09,285
- [Ellie] That's my fault.

350
00:12:09,285 --> 00:12:11,202
No, sit down, sit down.

351
00:12:12,134 --> 00:12:14,546
Yeah, I think it's Gatorade, dang it!

352
00:12:14,546 --> 00:12:16,952
That's my fault, argh!

353
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,035
Calvin, that was naughty.

354
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:23,123
That made me really mad.

355
00:12:23,123 --> 00:12:24,459
Don't do that.

356
00:12:24,459 --> 00:12:26,662
Okay, well we're going to clean that up.

357
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,405
Totally my fault, left that out and open.

358
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:31,163
Jared's parents came over earlier today,

359
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:33,178
and we were telling them how our trip was.

360
00:12:33,178 --> 00:12:36,212
Literally, we looked away
from Calvin for, like,

361
00:12:36,212 --> 00:12:38,299
one minute, and he was up on the counter,

362
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,189
he had taken the chocolate
mix to make chocolate milk,

363
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:45,399
had it all over his
face, all over the floor.

364
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,664
Buddy!

365
00:12:46,664 --> 00:12:49,929
You missed your bagoo! (laughs)

366
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:53,205
Oh yeah, he's like, "Oh yeah,
that was fun, it was good."

367
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,251
- [Ellie] 'Kay, go clean up,
that's our favorite by the way.

368
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:57,505
Best carpet cleaner ever.

369
00:12:57,505 --> 00:12:58,650
Oh, it's wet!

370
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,017
- [Ellie] (laughs) Come here.

371
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:01,850
It's off.

372
00:13:03,113 --> 00:13:04,030
Now try it.

373
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:09,286
Do you want me to dab it
first, or spray it first?

374
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:11,396
I think maybe dab it and then spray it.

375
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:14,456
Jared brought home some Chinese money,

376
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:16,284
and the kids are gonna put
it in their piggy banks,

377
00:13:16,284 --> 00:13:18,500
so they have some money in there.

378
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,333
Help Dad.

379
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,170
Take this rag, and dab
it on the mess, 'kay?

380
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,670
Can you do that?

381
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,503
Like this.

382
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:25,944
- [Ellie] (laughs) He just farted.

383
00:13:25,944 --> 00:13:27,559
(Calvin and Jared chuckle)

384
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,392
Can you do that?

385
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,509
Can you push it down on it?

386
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,679
There you go, there you go.

387
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,812
- [Ellie] Good job.

388
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,843
Good helper.

389
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,176
'Kay, push hard.

390
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:39,912
- [Ellie] Good job, bud.

391
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,170
I'm just glad it's not pee.

392
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:44,344
(Ellie chuckles)

393
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:46,691
(Calvin shouts)

394
00:13:46,691 --> 00:13:50,387
- [Ellie] Jackson, do you
want to let Penny out now?

395
00:13:50,387 --> 00:13:52,790
Or are you still webbing her up?

396
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,876
- [Jackson] Yeah.

397
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:57,123
- [Ellie] (chuckles) He took
his spiderwebs and webbed her.

398
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:59,206
(laughs)

399
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:05,909
Well it's not very often that
Spider-Man asks to go to bed.

400
00:14:05,909 --> 00:14:08,387
I was putting Calvin to
bed, and I told Jackson,

401
00:14:08,387 --> 00:14:10,465
"Play for a minute while
I get Calvin to sleep,

402
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:11,575
"and then I'll put you to bed."

403
00:14:11,575 --> 00:14:14,720
And he came in while I
was putting Calvin to bed,

404
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,209
and he laid down, and he goes,

405
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:19,575
he goes, "Can you just put me to bed now?"

406
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:22,054
I was like, so I had him lie on my lap

407
00:14:22,054 --> 00:14:25,860
while I put Calvin to bed,
and now you're ready for bed.

408
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,443
He is, like, tired.

409
00:14:29,351 --> 00:14:31,681
You'll sleep good tonight, huh?

410
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:35,444
Now when Mommy and Daddy are home, huh?

411
00:14:35,444 --> 00:14:36,277
'Kay.

412
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:37,703
It has been a huge day
of playing catch up.

413
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,546
I have been working all
day long in the office,

414
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,594
and Ellie's been with the
kids, playing with them.

415
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:44,820
We all have been playing with them,

416
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,895
picking up Penny, it's
just been a great day,

417
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,530
but it's been a very, very busy day.

418
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,367
The jet lag, I'm actually really surprised

419
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,540
it has not got me at all.

420
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,487
Like, I feel great, I feel like I got

421
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:55,924
a good night's sleep last night.

422
00:14:55,924 --> 00:14:59,164
But one person it has got is Ellie.

423
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,117
(chuckles)

424
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:01,534
They are so cute.

425
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:05,067
No joke, that is the third time

426
00:15:05,067 --> 00:15:07,356
I have caught Ellie falling asleep.

427
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:12,349
And I have felt much better
than I thought I would.

428
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:14,852
Once in the bedroom, once on
the couch, once downstairs.

429
00:15:14,852 --> 00:15:15,927
It's nine o'clock--

430
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:19,677
(cup clatters in background)

431
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,074
That was close.

432
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,658
It's nine o'clock at night,
which is understandable,

433
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:29,469
she's really, really tired.

434
00:15:29,469 --> 00:15:31,341
So I think we're going to call it a night.

435
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:33,317
We are back from China.

436
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:34,938
It feels so good to be at home,

437
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:38,174
to breathe the cool, crisp mountain air.

438
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:40,869
To have Penny home,
she is such a good dog.

439
00:15:40,869 --> 00:15:42,144
To be with the kids.

440
00:15:42,144 --> 00:15:46,181
I swear, these kids have just
like grown up and matured,

441
00:15:46,181 --> 00:15:50,114
like, hearing the story from
Ellie's mom about Jackson

442
00:15:50,114 --> 00:15:52,897
in the car saying, you
know, "Don't cry, Calvin,

443
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,540
"Mommy and Daddy will be home soon."

444
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,856
Like, oh it just pulls at my heartstrings.

445
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,911
And when Jackson, when we saw him,

446
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,668
he was like, "I wanna see my surprise,

447
00:16:01,668 --> 00:16:03,395
"but I'll wait 'til morning."

448
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,505
It was so cute.

449
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,881
So Jared and I are going to bed right now,

450
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,431
and I was telling him,
like, how good I felt today,

451
00:16:09,431 --> 00:16:11,397
and I don't feel a jet
lag, and he was like,

452
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,575
"Ellie, you're totally jet
lagged, you keep falling asleep."

453
00:16:13,575 --> 00:16:14,833
(both laugh)

454
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:18,016
So I am, I think we all are,
how could you not, you know?

455
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:20,024
I mean, I feel pretty good.

456
00:16:20,024 --> 00:16:21,990
I haven't fallen asleep,
I've been going all day.

457
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,644
You have done really good.
Yeah.

458
00:16:24,644 --> 00:16:27,914
I think I just thought,
I've never experienced it,

459
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,726
like, I thought with jet
lag, you would feel really,

460
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,308
really sick for some reason.

461
00:16:33,308 --> 00:16:35,262
I don't know.
Yeah, I mean you would get,

462
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,634
like, headaches, and you just feel woozy,

463
00:16:38,634 --> 00:16:39,958
and that sort of thing.
Yeah.

464
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,709
And so that's why I'm
like, I'm doing good!

465
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,997
'Cause I feel good,
other than being tired.

466
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:47,488
But yep, I've fallen
asleep several times today.

467
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:49,481
- [Jared] It's all about being tired.

468
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:51,875
- [Ellie] Yeah, so I guess totes.

469
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,351
Hi, Miss Penny.

470
00:16:53,351 --> 00:16:55,659
(both laugh)

471
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:57,182
Hi, pretty girl.

472
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,761
- [Jared] Are you happy to be home?

473
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,427
- [Ellie] Yeah, pretty girl.

474
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:03,928
- [Jared] Yes, we missed you so much.

475
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:04,809
(Ellie laughs)

476
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,711
Just wanted to add that tidbit, I'm like,

477
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:09,163
okay, I totally am jet
lagged, I just thought

478
00:17:09,163 --> 00:17:11,483
that I would be sick, you know.

479
00:17:11,483 --> 00:17:14,730
'Kay, I'm Marco Poloing
my sister. (laughs)

480
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,869
I guess it's an app that
she keeps telling me to get,

481
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,471
so I'm talking to Julie right now.

482
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,895
So I'll see you guys later.

483
00:17:20,895 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
Bye!
