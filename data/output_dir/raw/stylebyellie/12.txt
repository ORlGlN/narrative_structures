1
00:00:00,017 --> 00:00:02,092
- I think I've got myself
in a little bit of a sticky

2
00:00:02,092 --> 00:00:02,986
situation.

3
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:04,306
- Two hours left!

4
00:00:04,306 --> 00:00:06,878
- Woo! That was scary.

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:09,795
- [Jared] Good morning stinky face.

6
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,864
Good morning stinky face.

7
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:16,367
- We're going

8
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:17,584
- [Jared] Going home

9
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,417
- I'm lame

10
00:00:19,283 --> 00:00:20,707
- We're going home

11
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:22,284
- K I just literally wiped
this floor so you guys move

12
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:23,135
this way.

13
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:24,316
- [Jared] Oh. Okay let's uh, let's uh,

14
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:25,205
make our way over to the exit over here.

15
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:27,634
We are going to say goodbye
to our little camper as

16
00:00:27,634 --> 00:00:28,939
we drive home and say going

17
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,622
We're saying goodbye to our oasis Ellie.

18
00:00:30,622 --> 00:00:33,807
- I know. I am glad that we
stayed a few days it was really

19
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:34,665
fun

20
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:36,023
- [Jared] It was really fun

21
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:37,031
- We'll come back.

22
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:38,745
I want to do, on the way
home I'm actually gonna write

23
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,375
down a bunch of state parks
that we should go to with

24
00:00:40,375 --> 00:00:42,463
the kids, and Penny can come too.

25
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:43,956
Cause I would love to do more of them.

26
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:45,000
It was really fun.

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,629
And you can stay at the state parks, like,

28
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,130
I was like oh we should have stayed

29
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,705
- Camped there.

30
00:00:49,705 --> 00:00:50,975
- That would have been cool.

31
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:52,132
- That would have been really cool

32
00:00:52,132 --> 00:00:52,965
- Next time.

33
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:54,522
- Yeah we talked about that
a lot yesterday as we were at

34
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,211
the state parks like let's just go here.

35
00:00:56,211 --> 00:00:58,084
But for now I've gotta drain the pooper.

36
00:00:58,084 --> 00:00:59,820
I think I've got myself in
a little bit of a sticky

37
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:00,824
situation.

38
00:01:00,824 --> 00:01:03,528
You know how just mere seconds
ago I said that it's time

39
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:04,616
to empty the pooper?

40
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:06,263
Well the pooper's not emptying,

41
00:01:06,263 --> 00:01:07,599
I think we have a clog.

42
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,150
- It's super windy and so we
jumped in the car and we're

43
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,110
waiting for someone to finish up.

44
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,254
Uhhh we're learning every
time we go on a little trip.

45
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,843
But I love that we have done
little trips because we're

46
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:19,814
learning every time.

47
00:01:19,814 --> 00:01:21,416
- I don't know how it
happened but I think our,

48
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,119
our tanked is clogged.

49
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,117
(Ellie giggling)

50
00:01:24,117 --> 00:01:26,304
- [Jared] Jackson, did you
poop in the toilet too much?

51
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:27,860
- Yeah.

52
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,389
- [Ellie] Yeah? And daddy.
Any way we really don't know

53
00:01:30,389 --> 00:01:34,806
what it is, but Daisy Fresh
is here to help us unclog

54
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:37,577
our trailer.

55
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:40,189
- Yeah..(baby rambles)

56
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:41,556
- Those are your blue glasses.

57
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:42,636
- Oh jeez

58
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,777
(Ellie giggling)

59
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:44,992
- [Ellie] We're newbies!

60
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:46,115
- K so.

61
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:46,948
- We're newbies!

62
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:48,043
- I don't often make mistakes

63
00:01:48,043 --> 00:01:49,105
(Ellie laughs)

64
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,570
Wait no! Here's the thing!

65
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,657
No! I take that back, I ruin everything.

66
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:54,628
I ruin everything!

67
00:01:54,628 --> 00:01:55,461
- No you don't

68
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:57,864
- So what happened was, there's
two caps on the ends of the

69
00:01:57,864 --> 00:01:58,697
hose.

70
00:01:58,697 --> 00:02:00,035
I took the one off and I
didn't take the other off,

71
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:01,053
and

72
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:02,126
- It clogged it.

73
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:04,662
- It clogged the whole thing.
But luckily the clog was just

74
00:02:04,662 --> 00:02:07,343
in the hose and not in
the tank themselves.

75
00:02:07,343 --> 00:02:09,973
So strike one for Jared being stupid.

76
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,053
- The guy laughed.

77
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:12,616
- The guy laughed. He was like oh, I see,

78
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:14,947
I see so much worse so
don't you even worry.

79
00:02:14,947 --> 00:02:16,524
Like thank goodness, I said,

80
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,268
you're not gonna go home
and tell your wife are ya?

81
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:20,155
He's like yeah I probably will.

82
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:22,570
- At least the camper's not full of poop.

83
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,585
- Yeah. Ohh..

84
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:24,727
(Ellie giggling)

85
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:25,592
- K you ready to go home?

86
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:27,184
- Let's go. Fun trip.

87
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:30,684
(upbeat guitar strumming)

88
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,188
- [Ellie] Finally on the road.

89
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,021
- Oh my god.

90
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:34,854
- Good job Jar.

91
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,371
- That was a poopy situation.

92
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:37,617
(ding)

93
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:41,015
But we're finally on the
road. My goodness gracious.

94
00:02:41,015 --> 00:02:42,114
And that's the thing is like,

95
00:02:42,114 --> 00:02:46,082
I'm like, I'm upset with
myself but at the same time

96
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,908
I have to take it with
a grain of salt because

97
00:02:47,908 --> 00:02:50,717
this is our like fourth
time ever taking it out.

98
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:51,550
- Yeah.

99
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,244
- You're gonna have some
things, and I went to go look at

100
00:02:53,244 --> 00:02:54,999
the other hoses that they
had to get replacement caps.

101
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:58,129
None of them even had caps
on them so I was like,

102
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:01,433
oh maybe I just didn't even
need those in the first place.

103
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,314
Any way

104
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:04,268
- We have a lot to learn
but this is gonna be a fun

105
00:03:04,268 --> 00:03:06,293
adventure like Jared and I were saying.

106
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:10,304
Our kids are gonna remember
these hopefully trips for their

107
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,680
whole life cause like, this
is like a lot of the things

108
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,517
that we wanna do like as a family.

109
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:16,387
- Yeah and hopefully they
remember the good parts about that

110
00:03:16,387 --> 00:03:18,183
- They will.

111
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:21,016
(slow trap music)

112
00:03:25,036 --> 00:03:26,778
- [Ellie] You have the
garage door opener ready?

113
00:03:26,778 --> 00:03:30,084
K hold it, we have about 7 more hours

114
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,229
- That was such a sad face

115
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,121
- [Ellie] Aww.

116
00:03:33,121 --> 00:03:34,446
Mawww.

117
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:38,654
- Oh seven hours. That's
like 14 Peppa Pig shows.

118
00:03:38,654 --> 00:03:41,487
(slow trap music)

119
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:45,759
- [Ellie] Is this crazy?

120
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,432
You don't love it?

121
00:03:47,432 --> 00:03:50,392
Oh my gosh. I don't even
know, oh I saw lighting.

122
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:52,682
(Ellie gasping)

123
00:03:52,682 --> 00:03:54,792
It is down pouring.

124
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:57,232
I just saw lighting and then
it thundered like crazy.

125
00:03:57,232 --> 00:03:59,185
I don't even know if Penny
gotta go to the bathroom.

126
00:03:59,185 --> 00:04:02,201
They were outside for awhile
but she, she just was like

127
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,550
standing there.

128
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,549
Did she go potty?

129
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:07,951
- I don't know, I there,
uh..I fricken hurt my legs.

130
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:10,549
I got pelted every
where. I am sobbing wet.

131
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,657
- It's hailing.

132
00:04:11,657 --> 00:04:13,234
(Ellie chuckling)

133
00:04:13,234 --> 00:04:14,651
- That was scary.

134
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:17,303
- Did she go potty?

135
00:04:17,303 --> 00:04:19,947
- I have no idea. It hurt too
bad maybe we'll wait it out

136
00:04:19,947 --> 00:04:20,807
- She was just standing there.

137
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:24,719
Let's go, we'll stop again in an hour.

138
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:25,552
Gosh dang it.

139
00:04:25,552 --> 00:04:27,158
- Do you hear that thunder?

140
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,112
- Yeah I saw the lighting.

141
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:28,945
- It was right there.

142
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:30,445
- Yeah I saw the lighting.

143
00:04:30,445 --> 00:04:33,278
(slow trap music)

144
00:04:37,216 --> 00:04:38,224
- [Ellie] This is kind of scary.

145
00:04:38,224 --> 00:04:40,204
- Yeah. You don't like it?

146
00:04:40,204 --> 00:04:41,938
- [Ellie] What do you want me to do?

147
00:04:41,938 --> 00:04:43,956
- Film the blue sky

148
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:45,873
- Okay I'll make sure to
film the blue sky guys,

149
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:48,124
we see it, it's over there.

150
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:49,123
I filmed it.

151
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,460
(Ellie giggling)

152
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,293
(slow trap music)

153
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:15,343
- We have two hours left

154
00:05:15,343 --> 00:05:16,504
- [Jared] Woo hoo

155
00:05:16,504 --> 00:05:17,682
- Right two hours?

156
00:05:17,682 --> 00:05:18,726
- Two and a half

157
00:05:18,726 --> 00:05:20,728
- 6:30. We have two hours left

158
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:22,867
- We are almost there. Final stretch.

159
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:23,747
- Bahhh!!

160
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:26,048
- Kind of has felt like the
final stretch for the past

161
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:27,384
two hours, hasn't it?

162
00:05:27,384 --> 00:05:31,154
- Uh. I am so unbelievably
grateful that we grabbed Calvin's

163
00:05:31,154 --> 00:05:34,597
potty. It's been such a
life saver when we stopped.

164
00:05:34,597 --> 00:05:35,734
- Yes it has.

165
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,561
- He hasn't had any accidents
on the way home and we've

166
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:39,648
been driving forever so,

167
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:42,412
very grateful we brought that potty.

168
00:05:42,412 --> 00:05:43,922
What's up? Did you just huff?

169
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:45,938
- No I'm just tryna get up this hill.

170
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:47,547
I'm just like, trying to help the car.

171
00:05:47,547 --> 00:05:48,978
Come on!

172
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:50,928
All these little cars are
passing us like nobody's business

173
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,274
I'm like, come on we
can get there, come on.

174
00:05:53,274 --> 00:05:55,758
- [Ellie] Oh Penny girl,
we are almost home.

175
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:58,785
Trying to make everybody
happy on this, um, drive home

176
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:01,755
is sometimes really hard
and sometimes we just say

177
00:06:01,755 --> 00:06:04,067
sorry we can't do anything
for you, be quiet.

178
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,273
They've been pretty good though.

179
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:07,217
Penny is very ready to get home,

180
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:09,736
she's having the time
of her life right now.

181
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:12,931
Jared's taking a lot of extra
time with her so she walk

182
00:06:12,931 --> 00:06:13,997
and run around. It's snowing!

183
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:15,209
Kids are you doing okay?

184
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,042
- No. I wanna see dad.

185
00:06:18,026 --> 00:06:20,809
- You want to see dad?
Look out your window,

186
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,867
other window, look out, do you see him?

187
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:24,759
- Yeah

188
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,543
- Are you doing okay?
What's wrong with you?

189
00:06:27,543 --> 00:06:29,051
- I need to go pee.

190
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:32,245
- Uh. We just came back from
peeing, he doesn't need to do

191
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:33,827
that. He just doesn't want
to be in his car seat.

192
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,632
Jackson we just, just
two seconds ago went.

193
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:38,138
We're almost home k?

194
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:40,162
- No. I want to go pee again.

195
00:06:40,162 --> 00:06:41,090
- Again?

196
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,179
- Yeah.

197
00:06:42,179 --> 00:06:44,481
- [Ellie] Where are they
running to? Just around.

198
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:49,106
Okay guys, I'm gonna take Jackson
one more time, even though

199
00:06:49,106 --> 00:06:50,177
you just went.

200
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,222
- Too dark! Too dark!

201
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:55,109
- [Ellie] Then don't cover
your eyes if it's too dark.

202
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:59,155
Pull your strap up. See
your strap on your chest?

203
00:06:59,155 --> 00:07:02,569
Pull it up. Pull it up. Little more.

204
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:04,138
Good job.

205
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,135
Pull yours up.

206
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:06,188
- Are you ready?

207
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,046
- Yeah.

208
00:07:07,046 --> 00:07:09,803
- Home sweet home! We made it.

209
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:11,863
I feel like I'm going to pass out.

210
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:14,975
Calvin! Are you running
because you have so much space?

211
00:07:14,975 --> 00:07:17,999
First thing he did when he
got inside was cat speed and

212
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:20,277
he ran through the whole living room.

213
00:07:20,277 --> 00:07:22,381
Oh my gosh. It feels good to be home.

214
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:26,897
Okay boys, I just want to say
that I am so incredibly proud

215
00:07:26,897 --> 00:07:29,948
of how well you guys did today in the car.

216
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,791
You were good sports all day long.

217
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:37,024
We were in the car for
almost 10 hours today.

218
00:07:37,024 --> 00:07:39,326
We took lots of potty breaks.

219
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,837
We had good snacks.

220
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:43,331
- And there was a rain storm.

221
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:47,664
- There was a rain storm.
There was tons of traffic.

222
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:51,699
There was tons of snow.
There was tons of rain.

223
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:54,713
It kind of was like the worst drive ever.

224
00:07:54,713 --> 00:07:55,933
Yeah lots of thunder.

225
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,352
- And two uh piles of thunder.

226
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,410
- Two piles of thunder
yeah. But you know what?

227
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,076
You guys were troopers the whole time.

228
00:08:04,076 --> 00:08:07,220
So thank you for being so
wonderful and awesome during our

229
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,341
trip today.

230
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:10,573
Did you guys have fun
on our trip to Vegas?

231
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,406
- Yeah.

232
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:12,414
- What was your favorite part?

233
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:14,206
- Going to the parks.

234
00:08:14,206 --> 00:08:15,232
- Oh good.

235
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:17,056
- Calvin what was your favorite part?

236
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:17,964
- Um.

237
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,041
- Going to the parks.

238
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:20,394
- Going parks.

239
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:23,591
- Oh good. I'm glad you formed
that opinion all by yourself.

240
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:25,874
Okay well it's time for you
guys to go to bed because it

241
00:08:25,874 --> 00:08:27,404
is way past your bedtime.

242
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,963
- Story first.

243
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:30,476
- Okay I'll read one story.

244
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:32,164
- Goodnight friendsies

245
00:08:32,164 --> 00:08:33,414
- Night poop

246
00:08:33,414 --> 00:08:38,269
- Ahh. You silly boys.
Ending the night on a laugh.

247
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,607
I went out to the garage to
back up the trailer inside the

248
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,730
house, or garage, I guess,
you don't want to back it up

249
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,916
in the house. And everyone was asleep.

250
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,242
Oh. You're here, you're laughing.

251
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:49,626
You're laughing you're not asleep.

252
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,310
I thought you were asleep for a second.

253
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,143
Hey.

254
00:08:52,143 --> 00:08:52,976
- [Ellie] What?

255
00:08:52,976 --> 00:08:54,732
- Do you have enough
energy to watch The Flash?

256
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:55,583
- Ugh! Yes.

257
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,224
- Okay, yes! We're gonna watch The Flash.

258
00:08:58,224 --> 00:09:01,481
- [Ellie] I yell at Jared when
he falls asleep during shows

259
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:02,441
- Yes you do.

260
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:07,194
- Yeah. I, I like think I've
fallen asleep maybe twice.

261
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:10,603
- Yeah. And the thing is, I
love falling asleep watching

262
00:09:10,603 --> 00:09:13,132
shows. Like it's my favorite thing.

263
00:09:13,132 --> 00:09:15,391
- It reminds me of
growing up with my sister,

264
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,857
like watching shows with Julie,

265
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:20,763
I always wanted to but then
she'd leave in the middle of it

266
00:09:20,763 --> 00:09:22,258
or she'd fall asleep, and I was like,

267
00:09:22,258 --> 00:09:23,551
watch this show with me.

268
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,721
- I just want you to watch
the whole thing with me.

269
00:09:26,721 --> 00:09:27,800
That's your thing.

270
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,978
- I just want you to love me.

271
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:33,127
- Hey, wasn't driving home crazy today?

272
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:36,342
- Um. Yeah. There was a really
bad wreck that happened like

273
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,416
seconds in front of us.

274
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,352
- Yeah.

275
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:43,249
- Um. That was very
crazy and nerve wracking.

276
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,534
And the weather. And..

277
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:47,397
- Was all over the place.
Like it was so crazy.

278
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:50,397
Literally was not a great day today.

279
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,127
Like as bad as that sounds.

280
00:09:53,127 --> 00:09:55,864
We had a poopy situation.

281
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:58,984
We had terrible weather. Like hail,

282
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:00,052
snow,

283
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:00,885
rain,

284
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:03,581
thunder, and lighting. All today.

285
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:04,583
- It was crazy.

286
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:05,447
- Yeah it was crazy.

287
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:06,822
- It was successful but I'm like

288
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,962
- So it's like successful you know?

289
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:12,246
But we're home, we're gonna
zonk with Berry Allen, the

290
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,386
