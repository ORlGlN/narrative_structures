1
00:00:00,067 --> 00:00:01,891
- I just asked Calvin a question

2
00:00:01,891 --> 00:00:04,969
and he answered in the
cutest way possible.

3
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,155
Calvin?

4
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:07,714
What kind of bath do you wanna take?

5
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:08,685
- Bubble.

6
00:00:08,685 --> 00:00:09,592
- A bubble bath?

7
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:11,414
- Yeah.
- Okay.

8
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:12,247
- And with the vroom, vroom, vroom.

9
00:00:12,247 --> 00:00:13,250
- [Child] I'm not taking a bath.

10
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,341
- [Mom] With the motorcycle?

11
00:00:15,341 --> 00:00:16,461
- Yeah.

12
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:17,718
- (laughs) He always
says vroom, vroom, vroom.

13
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:19,542
- I'm not taking bath.

14
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:20,780
- You don't wanna take a bath?

15
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,825
- No.

16
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:23,969
- I guess we'll be the stinky ones today.

17
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:25,196
- Silly.

18
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:26,337
- [Mom] (laughs) Silly.

19
00:00:26,337 --> 00:00:27,958
- Yeah.

20
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,345
- You're funny.

21
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:30,178
- Yeah.

22
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,206
- It's funny when kids start talking more.

23
00:00:33,206 --> 00:00:34,870
- Boop, boop, boop.
(Calvin screams)

24
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,857
- [Mom] Aw, he doesn't want
you jumping on his belly.

25
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:39,052
Gotta be soft.

26
00:00:39,052 --> 00:00:41,356
I would not want him to jump on yours.

27
00:00:41,356 --> 00:00:42,189
- No.

28
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:43,446
(kissing sounds)

29
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:44,300
- [Mom] Downstairs.

30
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,526
- Yep.

31
00:00:45,526 --> 00:00:46,443
And all the

32
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,015
jars.

33
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,188
- Jars?

34
00:00:50,188 --> 00:00:51,329
Okay.

35
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:53,089
I was in the middle of getting ready

36
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:54,529
and Jackson runs upstairs and says,

37
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:57,388
"Mom, I'm gonna play Candy Land".

38
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:58,860
And I said, "Do you want
me to play with you?".

39
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,630
And he goes, "I love you".

40
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,860
That makes me feel
good. Where is the game?

41
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:03,937
- It's in there.

42
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:06,770
- Oh. It's in the locked cabinets.

43
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:09,634
- See, it's right there.

44
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:10,634
- Yup, okay.

45
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:15,201
So whoever wins gets
to eat candy for lunch.

46
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:17,996
Is that the deal? (laughs)

47
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,350
I'm the best.

48
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,324
I eat candy whenever the heck I want.

49
00:01:21,324 --> 00:01:22,881
- Because, I'm gonna be the blue.

50
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:23,905
- Oh, the blue?

51
00:01:23,905 --> 00:01:24,738
- Yeah.

52
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:25,571
- Can I be the green?

53
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,404
- Yeah.

54
00:01:26,404 --> 00:01:28,321
- Calvin just wants to play with trucks.

55
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,013
- Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna open it.

56
00:01:31,013 --> 00:01:33,135
- Okay, Calvin and I'll
be a player together.

57
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,503
- I'm gonna stop on the broken X's.

58
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:36,837
- Okay, you go here.

59
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:37,670
- Okay.

60
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,970
- And it says the youngest picks first.

61
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,858
So start right here.

62
00:01:40,858 --> 00:01:43,119
And, Calvin and I will be a team.

63
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,786
So, you start here and you pick one card.

64
00:01:45,786 --> 00:01:47,631
Pick one card and tell me what it says.

65
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:48,741
What's it say?

66
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:50,842
- Stand on an orange card.

67
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:52,602
- Okay, so two of 'em.

68
00:01:52,602 --> 00:01:54,447
So count two oranges.

69
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:55,845
One orange.

70
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:56,678
Two orange.

71
00:01:56,678 --> 00:01:57,850
So you put your guy right there.

72
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,989
Holy cow, Jackson gets to
jump through half the game.

73
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,055
What!

74
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:05,605
Half the guys are lost
and Calvin has my guy,

75
00:02:05,605 --> 00:02:07,471
so I have a piece of paper.

76
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,095
- Hey mom, I'm going around, around.

77
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,407
- I know, I need to get a good card.

78
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,922
- And around and around,

79
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:15,331
and I went right here.

80
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:16,170
- But maybe I'll win.

81
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,685
Maybe I'll catch up.

82
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:19,168
- No, I'm going to win.

83
00:02:19,168 --> 00:02:21,226
- (laughs) You're gonna win.

84
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:22,965
One, one yellow.

85
00:02:22,965 --> 00:02:24,245
(Calvin grunts)

86
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:26,339
Okay, your turn (laughs).

87
00:02:26,339 --> 00:02:27,621
One red.

88
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:30,717
Jackson is getting all of the good ones.

89
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,726
There we go.

90
00:02:31,726 --> 00:02:34,372
This could be the final
card for Mr. Jackson.

91
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:35,789
What does it say?

92
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:39,801
Ah, you have to go back!

93
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:41,188
(Mom gasps)

94
00:02:41,188 --> 00:02:42,777
- And I win!

95
00:02:42,777 --> 00:02:45,194
(Mom laughs)

96
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,875
- We'll call that the game.

97
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:49,475
- Yes!

98
00:02:49,475 --> 00:02:53,838
- Good job! (laughs)
- I wanna play it again.

99
00:02:53,838 --> 00:02:54,905
- You wanna film?

100
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:55,738
- Yes.

101
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:56,713
- Okay.

102
00:02:56,713 --> 00:03:00,850
I wanted to give you guys
another update on my hair.

103
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,132
I've been telling you that
I've been trying to keep it

104
00:03:03,132 --> 00:03:05,116
pretty healthy, I've just cut it.

105
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:08,423
And I really do like to have it blonde.

106
00:03:08,423 --> 00:03:10,524
I haven't used this in forever,

107
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,818
especially since the last
time I really went blonde.

108
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,663
Hey, you're moving around mister!

109
00:03:14,663 --> 00:03:16,007
(Jackson groans)

110
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:18,930
But it's the Oplex number three, so I'm--

111
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,135
Is the red button on?

112
00:03:20,135 --> 00:03:20,968
- [Jackson] Yup.

113
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,791
- I recently cut it, I've
been trying to keep it blonde.

114
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:26,386
I've already told you that, but usually

115
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:29,138
with my hair, I like to do treatments

116
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:30,578
to make it hydrated.

117
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,711
So usually before I shower,

118
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:35,047
Usually before I shower,

119
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:37,468
I will put conditioner on the ends--

120
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:40,370
but I got this Oplex number three

121
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,503
that you put on your
hair before you wash it.

122
00:03:42,503 --> 00:03:44,551
It's supposed to bond your hair

123
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,267
and strengthen your hair between,

124
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,267
between you coloring it.

125
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:52,206
I just did it for the
first time in a long time.

126
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:54,553
My hair feels really good.

127
00:03:54,553 --> 00:03:57,625
Jackson really wanted to film that.

128
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:00,748
Hopefully I didn't stumble over
words and you could see me.

129
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:02,826
Are you becoming a cameraman?

130
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:03,659
- Yeah.

131
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:05,183
- He really wanted to film.

132
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:08,511
Anyway, I really want to give
you guys updates on my hair

133
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:12,106
because I think it's important
when you do color it so much,

134
00:04:12,106 --> 00:04:14,602
or even with winter coming,
like Julie, my sister,

135
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:17,194
has a lot of static in her hair.

136
00:04:17,194 --> 00:04:18,911
This really has helped my hair a lot.

137
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,223
I've had this for months,

138
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:21,620
and I only use it once in a while,

139
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,956
but I really should use it more often.

140
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:26,506
Jackson, why do you like filming?

141
00:04:26,506 --> 00:04:28,020
- [Jackson] Because I do.

142
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,666
- Cause you see mommy and daddy do it?

143
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:32,351
And you think it's fun?

144
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:33,204
(Jackson groans)

145
00:04:33,204 --> 00:04:34,068
Huh?

146
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,412
- [Jackson] Yeah.

147
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:38,111
- I think it's cute that you wanna film.

148
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,988
Maybe when you start
playing with toys more,

149
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,338
you can film what stuff
you like to play with.

150
00:04:43,338 --> 00:04:45,930
Jackson doesn't really
play with a ton of toys.

151
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,583
He likes to do games.

152
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,911
Like our little colored
game, our block game.

153
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:52,564
Or like the Candy Land.

154
00:04:52,564 --> 00:04:54,282
He likes to play with games,

155
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:56,308
not really just one-on-one toys.

156
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:58,068
(Jackson mumbles)

157
00:04:58,068 --> 00:04:59,594
- [Jackson] Or video games.

158
00:04:59,594 --> 00:05:03,370
Playing Mario Kart, or dragon Mario kart.

159
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,036
- Or video games he says.

160
00:05:06,036 --> 00:05:07,679
(laughs)

161
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,482
That's hilarious.

162
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,284
No, go put them back.

163
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:12,117
- [Calvin] No.
- [Mom] Calvin.

164
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:13,695
Calvin!

165
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:14,879
(laughs)

166
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,556
Come pick 'em up, put 'em back.

167
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:20,330
That was a good listener.

168
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,236
That was a good listener.

169
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,303
I really think he was like,

170
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,284
I was gonna lose them.

171
00:05:23,284 --> 00:05:24,607
Thank you!

172
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,684
(laughs)

173
00:05:25,684 --> 00:05:27,455
When I get ready, the kids just play

174
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:30,730
in the clothes and grab our shoes.

175
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,796
He was a good listener.

176
00:05:31,796 --> 00:05:32,980
I really thought he was leaving.

177
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,378
He really heard my voice yell at him,

178
00:05:34,378 --> 00:05:36,298
so that's why he came back.

179
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:40,031
He's just scared of me cause I yell a lot.

180
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,772
- [Dad] Calvin has barricaded himself.

181
00:05:42,772 --> 00:05:44,490
During lunch.

182
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,132
Take a bite (laughs).

183
00:05:46,132 --> 00:05:47,530
- He always likes to eat.

184
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,791
- [Dad] I know, he just
did it earlier, didn't he?

185
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,698
- Look at this eyes.

186
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:52,287
- [Dad] I think he just likes playing.

187
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,802
- Look, he barricaded him in.

188
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:54,996
(Dad laughs)
Here Cal.

189
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:58,111
- [Dad] He's pulled these bar
stools up next to himself.

190
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:00,234
That is so funny.

191
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,140
Look, now he's peeking around.

192
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,367
Hey, I see you!

193
00:06:02,367 --> 00:06:03,562
- [Mom] Here ya go, Cal.

194
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,051
- I see you.
- Here's a cookie.

195
00:06:05,051 --> 00:06:06,619
- Take a cookie.

196
00:06:06,619 --> 00:06:07,452
Yum.

197
00:06:07,452 --> 00:06:09,285
(both laugh)

198
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,589
- Okay, I'm ready to take another bite.

199
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:12,422
- What?

200
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:14,704
- I'm ready to take another bite.

201
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,701
- I feel like Dad may have
coached you into saying that.

202
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,461
- [Dad] Do you like it, Jackson?

203
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,763
I didn't make him say that.

204
00:06:20,763 --> 00:06:21,596
- Nuh-uh?

205
00:06:21,596 --> 00:06:23,547
- Yeah, I said "hey
Jackson, did you like it?"

206
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:24,485
And what'd you say?

207
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:25,318
- Yes.

208
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,853
- And I said, "do you wanna
go take another bite?"

209
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,283
And what'd you say?

210
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:30,000
- Yes.
- [Mom] Here ya go.

211
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
- [Dad] Good boy!
- We're not really doing much

212
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,443
sit down right now.

213
00:06:32,443 --> 00:06:34,384
We're kinda running and just

214
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:35,984
eat food, we're ready to go.

215
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:37,136
It worked!

216
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,405
You're eating it!

217
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,421
(chuckles) You sit there and eat that.

218
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,192
That is just quinoa.

219
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:45,382
I made quinoa, and I
left a little extra plain

220
00:06:45,382 --> 00:06:46,961
just in case.

221
00:06:46,961 --> 00:06:50,579
And it has quinoa, meat, and onions,

222
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:52,025
and southwest seasoning.

223
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,433
And then I just put in bell peppers

224
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:54,873
and I'm cooking that right now.

225
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:57,582
- Getting kids to eat new, different foods

226
00:06:57,582 --> 00:07:01,209
is one of life's great
challenges as parents.

227
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:02,318
We're still working on it.

228
00:07:02,318 --> 00:07:04,868
- Like you saw earlier,
if I just yell a lot,

229
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,180
(Dad laughs) then they'll do it.

230
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,068
- No, really what it is, it's just like

231
00:07:08,068 --> 00:07:11,118
the key is, if you can just
try it, that's the thing.

232
00:07:11,118 --> 00:07:13,572
If you just try it, and if they actually

233
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,129
eat it and swallow it and everything,

234
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:17,476
then they're like, oh
this is actually good,

235
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:19,065
I'm just trying something new.

236
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:20,953
That's exactly what just
happened with Jackson.

237
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,918
He was very, very hesitant to try it.

238
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,798
Once he actually got a
piece that he bit through

239
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:27,982
and was chewing on it and everything,

240
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:30,660
he's like, oh sorry
about that Mom and Dad,

241
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,316
I actually do like this and I
would like some more please.

242
00:07:33,316 --> 00:07:35,482
- Seriously though.

243
00:07:35,482 --> 00:07:37,874
It's hard to do at Calvin's
age, sometimes it's like,

244
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,466
- [Calvin] I want a cupcake!

245
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,418
- [Dad] Now you want a cupcake?

246
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:44,125
- No, I want cookie.
- Oh, a cookie?

247
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:45,650
- But I did tell him that.

248
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,965
Usually I try not to
bribe too much like that,

249
00:07:47,965 --> 00:07:50,066
like you can have a cookie after.

250
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:52,210
We do that sometimes,
especially for dinner.

251
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,226
Honestly, usually me
or Jared will just say,

252
00:07:54,226 --> 00:07:55,751
Mom worked really hard,

253
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,021
you have to have one bite.

254
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:57,854
- [Dad] Yeah.

255
00:07:57,854 --> 00:07:59,687
- I worked hard, you need to eat one bite.

256
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:02,034
- [Dad] Mm-hm.
- I want ginger cookie.

257
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:03,095
- Okay, well you'll have to
wait until I'm done eating,

258
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:04,418
and then we'll get you one.

259
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,125
- [Narrator] Three hours later.

260
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,767
- You're getting into that time of year

261
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:10,167
where it is not that late at night,

262
00:08:10,167 --> 00:08:13,773
and it gets so dark outside, it's so dark.

263
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,501
We went on a Sunday drive.

264
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,186
We haven't done that very much.

265
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,159
We always did that growing up.

266
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,834
But today, we put the kids in the car

267
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,775
and just like drove around.

268
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:24,631
It was really fun just
to look at the mountains,

269
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:28,105
look at the colors of the fall changing.

270
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:31,188
- I always like to admire
the beauty of our backyard.

271
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,298
We call it our backyard,

272
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:33,748
but we're just talking
about where we live.

273
00:08:33,748 --> 00:08:36,820
- [Mom] The area, yeah.
- The area in which we live.

274
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,030
I'm still editing this
video, it's a long story.

275
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,993
It was just nice to get out

276
00:08:41,993 --> 00:08:45,243
and appreciate the beauty of the world.

277
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,075
- Doesn't seem like you're very grateful.

278
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,027
(laughs)

279
00:08:51,027 --> 00:08:52,382
That's better.

280
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:54,355
- Show me your gratitude face.

281
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:55,219
Yay!

282
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:57,843
Show me your angry face.

283
00:08:57,843 --> 00:08:59,676
Show me your sad face.

284
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,257
Show me your happy face.

285
00:09:04,179 --> 00:09:06,929
Show me your 'I love Jared' face.

286
00:09:08,905 --> 00:09:10,345
(laughs)

287
00:09:10,345 --> 00:09:11,774
That was provocative.

288
00:09:11,774 --> 00:09:13,865
- That's my 'I love you'.

289
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:15,177
- Aww.

290
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,329
Show me your--

291
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:18,046
- Poop face.

292
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:23,017
- Show me your 'it's late
on a Sunday night' face.

293
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,563
- I told Jared I had a headache today.

294
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,483
He goes, "You always have a headache."

295
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,659
(Jared laughs) I'm like, well,

296
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,526
I'm tired.
- I was just gonna say

297
00:09:30,526 --> 00:09:32,606
that's what's called
being a mom of two kids.

298
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:34,249
(both laugh)

299
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:35,571
Here's the face that I want you to do.

300
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:36,926
I want to do the face that goes

301
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,419
with the Lego picture behind there.

302
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:39,945
So I'll hold the camera up,

303
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,705
and you make a face.

304
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:43,582
Pretend to be in that picture too.

305
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:46,302
- ♫ [Female] Everything is awesome.

306
00:09:46,302 --> 00:09:47,497
- Jared?

307
00:09:47,497 --> 00:09:48,585
- Not my face exactly.

308
00:09:48,585 --> 00:09:49,865
- Where's Calvin? I can't see Calvin.

309
00:09:49,865 --> 00:09:51,923
- That's Jackson and that's Calvin.

310
00:09:51,923 --> 00:09:54,078
When you're that close,
it's kinda hard to see.

311
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:55,230
In the camera, it looks perfect.

312
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,289
- Calvin's like.

313
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:59,049
- (laughs) Aww.

314
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,190
That's so fun to have that.

315
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,619
- I love this.

316
00:10:01,619 --> 00:10:02,814
- I love hanging it on the wall.

317
00:10:02,814 --> 00:10:04,254
- I can't believe they made that for us.

318
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,267
- It's so cool.
- Lego.

319
00:10:05,267 --> 00:10:06,995
- Thanks, Lego.
(bell ringing sound)

320
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,969
I think I do this far too often,

321
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:13,203
but it just makes me so
grateful that we do this.

322
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:17,278
I'm done editing our
drone video of the house.

323
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,445
I can't help but have tears
just come down my face because

324
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:25,410
of how grateful I am for this experience.

325
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,863
Just watching the footage
back and just seeing.

326
00:10:27,863 --> 00:10:31,682
Even just two years ago
when we got the lot.

327
00:10:31,682 --> 00:10:35,405
Where we were and where we are now.

328
00:10:35,405 --> 00:10:38,488
I am just so grateful for everything.

329
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:44,460
It makes me so happy to make these videos,

330
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,338
to have these videos to look back on.

331
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:48,599
Watching everything come to fruition,

332
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:50,114
our dreams come true.

333
00:10:50,114 --> 00:10:51,917
That's what we're doing right now,

334
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,820
and it's so amazing and I am so grateful.

335
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,463
If you guys haven't seen the video,

336
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:59,362
I'll have a link down
below and in the I card.

337
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:00,386
Make sure you check this out

338
00:11:00,386 --> 00:11:02,391
because it's very cool to see

339
00:11:02,391 --> 00:11:04,983
the drone perspective
of the house being built

340
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,895
and then go through
these memories together.

341
00:11:07,895 --> 00:11:09,314
A lot of you guys have joined us

342
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:12,098
on this journey as we've done it

343
00:11:12,098 --> 00:11:14,679
and it's just fun to look back.

344
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,077
Oh my gosh.

345
00:11:16,077 --> 00:11:18,893
My emotions are just
being pulled right now.

346
00:11:18,893 --> 00:11:21,186
I am just so happy right now.

347
00:11:21,186 --> 00:11:24,002
Ellie and I have been in
this house for one year.

348
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:26,434
Next month will be our anniversary,

349
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:29,485
which also means that we have had this lot

350
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,159
for two years.

351
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:33,047
What Ellie and I wanted to do

352
00:11:33,047 --> 00:11:36,119
is we wanted to do a Q&A about the house.

353
00:11:36,119 --> 00:11:38,380
The building process, the house itself.

354
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,354
Any questions related to the house.

355
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:41,794
We're gonna take the questions now,

356
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:43,277
but put it up later so that gives

357
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:45,293
a lot of time for you guys
to think of questions.

358
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:47,095
Leave them in the comments down below.

359
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:49,357
Tweet me or Ellie,

360
00:11:49,357 --> 00:11:50,797
or Instagram message us,

361
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:52,354
and we will answer your questions

362
00:11:52,354 --> 00:11:54,434
in a video coming up very soon.

363
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:56,567
But for now, it's 2:30 in the morning.

364
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,719
I've gotta get some sleep

365
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:59,522
before I edit tomorrow's vlog.

366
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:00,620
(laughs)

367
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,517
Thank you for watching.

368
00:12:01,517 --> 00:12:03,074
Have a wonderful day.

369
00:12:03,074 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see you guys next time, bye.
