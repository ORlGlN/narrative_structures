1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
(gentle music)

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,455
- And they basically confirmed

3
00:00:05,455 --> 00:00:08,952
that Ellie would be miscarrying.

4
00:00:08,952 --> 00:00:11,452
- I just have been pretty sad.

5
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,916
(gentle music)

6
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:48,717
- I'm not sure what the
future has in store for us,

7
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:52,545
but I just got hit with the fact that

8
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:53,488
this might be it,

9
00:00:53,488 --> 00:00:56,321
and that's not a bad thing at all.

10
00:00:58,153 --> 00:01:01,473
But it was hard for me to hear that voice

11
00:01:01,473 --> 00:01:03,129
say that to me,

12
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:06,962
that's what I wanted to
tell you a little bit.

13
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:10,474
(gentle music)

14
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:17,723
You okay?

15
00:01:17,723 --> 00:01:19,195
- [Ellie] I don't know.

16
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:21,262
I don't know how I feel.

17
00:01:21,262 --> 00:01:23,845
- Are you kidding me right now?

18
00:01:24,774 --> 00:01:26,878
- [Ellie] I just called Julie,

19
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,711
- Ellie?

20
00:01:27,711 --> 00:01:30,490
- [Ellie] Asking if
it's possible to have--

21
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,539
I know.

22
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:34,861
- Did you just take this?
- Yes.

23
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,111
(laughing)

24
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:39,367
- Oh my gosh.

25
00:01:40,949 --> 00:01:43,699
Ellie this is amazing, like what?

26
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:05,396
I think the strangest
thing about this is that

27
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:06,963
we struggled with infertility,

28
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,220
we could not get a
positive pregnancy test.

29
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,475
We couldn't get one.

30
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:15,876
And we've had three in such
a short amount of time.

31
00:02:15,876 --> 00:02:16,884
This is like--

32
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,204
- But two miscarriages.

33
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,869
- Yeah, it's so exciting,

34
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:23,442
it's just like the timing is just crazy.

35
00:02:23,442 --> 00:02:24,525
- Oh my gosh.

36
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:26,778
(gentle music)

37
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:27,611
(laughs)

38
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,452
Oh my gosh.

39
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:30,110
- Hey I love you so much.

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,975
- I love you.
- I love you.

41
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:33,357
- This is exciting.
- This is exciting.

42
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:35,801
- Jinx, you owe me a soda.
- It's just scary.

43
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:37,392
- It's just scary.
- Yeah.

44
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:39,033
- [Jared] Well given the circumstances,

45
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,575
given where we have been and where we were

46
00:02:41,575 --> 00:02:42,647
- You gotta be kidding me.

47
00:02:42,647 --> 00:02:44,539
- [Jared] and where we are now.

48
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,869
Like this close to a D&C,
that's what worries me.

49
00:02:46,869 --> 00:02:49,369
- Well I'm gonna very hopeful.

50
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:57,317
But I don't want to do that again.

51
00:02:57,317 --> 00:02:59,261
- I know exactly what you mean.

52
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,325
- That's what I said to
him over and over and over.

53
00:03:02,325 --> 00:03:06,591
I said I cannot mentally,
physically do that again.

54
00:03:06,591 --> 00:03:09,195
Like I just don't even know
how I would cope this time.

55
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,801
Like I can't.

56
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:12,068
I don't know how people do it.

57
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,697
- I think like being
there was hard enough,

58
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,234
let alone going through it.

59
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:18,067
- Yeah.

60
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:21,858
I told Julie, I was like,
maybe we'll get an ultrasound

61
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:23,117
between now and Thanksgiving

62
00:03:23,117 --> 00:03:24,966
and announce it at Thanksgiving.

63
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:26,632
- [Jared] Oh that would be fun.

64
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:30,177
- Yay, we officially
have known for two weeks

65
00:03:30,177 --> 00:03:33,242
and the excitement is hitting now.

66
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:34,641
Of course, we've been excited,

67
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:37,226
but we've been extremely weary

68
00:03:37,226 --> 00:03:40,153
with our last two pregnancies ending

69
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,049
in miscarriage back to back.

70
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:44,769
And I got my blood work done

71
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:46,513
and my levels look great,

72
00:03:46,513 --> 00:03:48,490
and a big thing that we and the doctors

73
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,216
have been worried about,
is my progesterone.

74
00:03:50,216 --> 00:03:52,821
The last time, my
progesterone was at a 10,

75
00:03:52,821 --> 00:03:55,887
and that's very low, and so
they had me on progesterone

76
00:03:55,887 --> 00:03:57,405
to get my levels up.

77
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:59,141
And the nurse just called me

78
00:03:59,141 --> 00:04:01,784
and was very excited and
said that my progesterone

79
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,693
has never been this high.

80
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:06,045
With me being in the office with Calvin

81
00:04:06,045 --> 00:04:07,805
and the last two pregnancies,

82
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:09,882
she says my levels are at a 30.

83
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:11,846
And she said I don't
even need progesterone.

84
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:14,513
And I am thrilled, I am excited.

85
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,289
I'm very very excited.

86
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,466
I've been really trying to rest a lot.

87
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:23,472
We've been laying in bed, watching shows.

88
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,896
I've been trying to eat
lots, keep hydrated,

89
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:28,924
so that is it where we are now.

90
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:31,323
So I am currently five weeks along

91
00:04:31,323 --> 00:04:32,423
and we already gave you an update

92
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:34,238
of how I have been feeling.

93
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:35,990
I haven't felt any different,

94
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,494
other than a little bit
of physical changes,

95
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:39,627
like a little fullness.

96
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:40,893
- Yeah.

97
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:42,957
- But we've been a week in China

98
00:04:42,957 --> 00:04:44,823
and no smells have bugged me,

99
00:04:44,823 --> 00:04:46,649
no food has upset me--

100
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,562
- Which there have been very strong smells

101
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:50,626
that Ellie's not used to,

102
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:52,143
and so that kind of surprises me

103
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,249
that you're not feeling
a lot of that stuff.

104
00:04:54,249 --> 00:04:55,082
- It's different,

105
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,040
I mean we're in a different country,

106
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,512
so of course the smell is different,

107
00:04:57,512 --> 00:05:01,269
but as far as like lots of
cigarette smoke and stuff.

108
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:03,545
But today is the fist
day where I have felt

109
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:05,466
very nauseous all day

110
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,377
and it's not anything other than

111
00:05:07,377 --> 00:05:10,706
I totally know that I
just don't feel well.

112
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:12,091
And I know it's that.

113
00:05:12,091 --> 00:05:12,924
- Yeah.

114
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:15,329
- And so, in a week, when
we get back in one week,

115
00:05:15,329 --> 00:05:16,834
I have a doctor's appointment
with an ultra sound

116
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:18,316
for an early ultra-sound,

117
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:19,149
to make sure everything's okay.

118
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:19,982
- Woo.

119
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:21,256
- So I'm nervous and I'm excited,

120
00:05:21,256 --> 00:05:23,476
but today I'm grateful
that I am not feeling well,

121
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:25,491
because I feel like that gives us--

122
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,379
- I remember thinking back,

123
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:31,672
just waiting for any sign
that you don't feel good

124
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:32,505
- Yeah.

125
00:05:32,505 --> 00:05:33,747
- And how grateful you were for that.

126
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:35,016
- But even last time, like last time,

127
00:05:35,016 --> 00:05:37,335
I three up multiple times.

128
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,535
- And that was like how
many times did you do that

129
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:40,428
with our other pregnancies?

130
00:05:40,428 --> 00:05:41,261
- None.

131
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,161
- None, so it was like amazing--

132
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:43,692
- And so you just never know really.

133
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:45,755
So I just, I hate that
you always have to have

134
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:47,306
that little thing in
the back of your mind,

135
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,597
but you do.
- Yeah.

136
00:05:48,597 --> 00:05:49,430
- Yeah.

137
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,223
- But as far as today,
that is how I'm doing.

138
00:05:51,223 --> 00:05:52,988
- And we're in heaven right now.

139
00:05:52,988 --> 00:05:53,821
Shangri-la.

140
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,701
(Ellie laughs)

141
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:56,534
Look.

142
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:58,415
- [Nurse] So it's just one.

143
00:05:58,415 --> 00:05:59,299
- [Jackson] Yeah.

144
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,132
- [Jared] Did you hear that Ellie?

145
00:06:00,132 --> 00:06:00,965
Just one.

146
00:06:00,965 --> 00:06:02,206
(Jared laughs)

147
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:03,095
- [Nurse] See the heart right there?

148
00:06:03,095 --> 00:06:04,262
- [Ellie] Yes.

149
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,043
(Calvin vocalizes)

150
00:06:07,043 --> 00:06:09,104
- [Jared] That's a baby.
(gentle music)

151
00:06:09,104 --> 00:06:09,937
- [Calvin] Oh.

152
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,605
- [Jared] That's your sibling right there.

153
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:13,848
- [Calvin] Yeah.

154
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:14,906
- [Jared] Yeah.

155
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:15,739
- I want to see.
- That's crazy,

156
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:17,826
- [Ellie] I can see a little flutter.

157
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:18,659
- [Jared] I know.

158
00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:20,885
You can see the heartbeat
moving, isn't that cool?

159
00:06:20,885 --> 00:06:22,174
End of June, first of July?

160
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:23,007
- [Nurse] Mmm-hmm.

161
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,489
- [Jared] Oh my goodness, a summer baby.

162
00:06:25,489 --> 00:06:26,322
(Jared laughing)

163
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:28,580
- [Calvin] We, huh?

164
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,413
- [Jared] Ellie.

165
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:30,246
- Yay.

166
00:06:30,246 --> 00:06:31,185
- [Jared] Yay.

167
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:33,081
- Oh, huh baby go?

168
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,545
- Where'd the baby go?

169
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,284
(laughing)

170
00:06:36,284 --> 00:06:38,649
- You'll see him plenty or her.

171
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,349
- [Ellie] That's cute.

172
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:42,703
- That's cute.
- Aww, that's so sweet.

173
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,768
- Is that the baby home?

174
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:47,410
- Yeah, is that the baby's home?

175
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,327
- Yeah.
- That was funny.

176
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:50,160
- Yeah.

177
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,305
- What did you think of that?

178
00:06:51,305 --> 00:06:52,490
(Calvin vocalizes)

179
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,323
(Jeremy laughs)

180
00:06:53,323 --> 00:06:54,369
What is that for?

181
00:06:54,369 --> 00:06:55,881
Those are called stirrups.

182
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:56,714
Ellie.

183
00:06:56,714 --> 00:06:57,829
- That all happened really fast,

184
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:58,936
I didn't have much time to react.

185
00:06:58,936 --> 00:07:01,165
- I know I heard three or four heartbeats

186
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:02,808
and then she turned it off.

187
00:07:02,808 --> 00:07:04,960
Oh Ellie, we heard our baby's heartbeat.

188
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,119
- Yeah, that was awesome.

189
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:08,328
- That was amazing.

190
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:12,304
You know what, just hearing the heartbeat,

191
00:07:12,304 --> 00:07:13,693
(snaps) something changes.

192
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:14,574
- Holy cow.

193
00:07:14,574 --> 00:07:15,452
It makes it more real.

194
00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,304
- [Jared] Yeah it does.

195
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:19,019
(Calvin vocalizes)

196
00:07:19,019 --> 00:07:21,213
That's our little baby.

197
00:07:21,213 --> 00:07:22,316
(laughs)

198
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,197
Did you hear that heartbeat.

199
00:07:24,197 --> 00:07:25,611
- Yes.

200
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,977
Did you see our baby?

201
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:28,810
(sighs)

202
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,886
- Do you remember--

203
00:07:29,886 --> 00:07:31,425
- A little bean.

204
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,823
- coming home with this picture,

205
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:34,089
but with Jackson?

206
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:34,956
- [Ellie] Yeah.

207
00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:36,039
- Oh my gosh.

208
00:07:37,706 --> 00:07:39,232
We're doing it again.

209
00:07:39,232 --> 00:07:40,065
- I'm so

210
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,843
I didn't know what to expect.

211
00:07:43,843 --> 00:07:46,159
I think you always think the
worst, especially after--

212
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,956
- Two back to back miscarriages.

213
00:07:47,956 --> 00:07:48,789
- Yeah.

214
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,531
- You never lose that feeling,

215
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:53,876
is that worry, that increased heart rate,

216
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:56,739
you never lose that, it's always there.

217
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,668
I think even until you
have the baby in your arms.

218
00:07:58,668 --> 00:07:59,501
- Yeah.

219
00:07:59,501 --> 00:08:01,810
- But when you hear the baby's heartbeat,

220
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,394
when you see that flutter on the screen.

221
00:08:03,394 --> 00:08:04,755
- Oh my gosh.

222
00:08:04,755 --> 00:08:06,187
- Everything inside you changes,

223
00:08:06,187 --> 00:08:08,134
I can't imagine what it's like for you.

224
00:08:08,134 --> 00:08:09,725
- Oh and it just feels good.

225
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:11,513
It's like okay I have felt sick

226
00:08:11,513 --> 00:08:13,896
and I'm going to be able to have a baby.

227
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:15,236
- Mmm-hmmm.

228
00:08:15,236 --> 00:08:17,214
- There was a baby in
there, with a heartbeat.

229
00:08:17,214 --> 00:08:19,101
- You've got a baby in your belly.

230
00:08:19,101 --> 00:08:22,361
- Like we are gonna be a
family of three, we're--

231
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,550
- Well five, 'cause we're in the family.

232
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,788
(laughs)

233
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,260
- Well like three kids, that's crazy.

234
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,228
- We're outnumbered.

235
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:31,700
- Calvin's gonna move rooms.

236
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,866
Like he's gonna have a big boy room,

237
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,033
we'll make up the nursery.

238
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:39,347
We'll buy teeny tiny diapers.

239
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,462
- And little bootie socks.

240
00:08:40,462 --> 00:08:43,563
- We'll find out our gender
around Valentine's day.

241
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:46,044
Like there's just so much.

242
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:47,260
- Holy cow.

243
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,913
- Like right now I'm nauseous,

244
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:51,171
I'm nauseous from morning 'til night.

245
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:53,774
And not bad, not like I can't do anything,

246
00:08:53,774 --> 00:08:55,948
just it's a constant.

247
00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:57,448
I don't feel well.

248
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,825
- But you haven't had that.
- And now

249
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:01,648
- with the other pregnancies.
- And I'm even happier.

250
00:09:01,648 --> 00:09:02,481
- Yeah.

251
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:03,314
- Yeah.

252
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:04,147
(yelling)

253
00:09:04,147 --> 00:09:04,980
(laughing)

254
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,946
It's weird to think like I'm
so happy I don't feel well,

255
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,505
but when it's this situation, you're like,

256
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,246
you're darn right I am,
- You always, yeah.

257
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:11,079
- you know?

258
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,924
Yesterday we had our ultra sound,

259
00:09:12,924 --> 00:09:14,994
and it's funny that it's
happening right now,

260
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:17,834
but I think Ellie's having
her very first craving.

261
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:19,753
Like she woke up this morning--

262
00:09:19,753 --> 00:09:21,073
- Don't judge me!

263
00:09:21,073 --> 00:09:24,488
- And was like just
craving mac and cheese.

264
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:25,898
- Well no what happened was,

265
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,761
I was up from 1:00 AM to four,

266
00:09:28,761 --> 00:09:29,889
could not sleep.

267
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:30,840
- [Jared] Nauseous, yeah?

268
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,417
- Oh I was nauseous,

269
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,041
and I got some chocolate milk,

270
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,489
because for some reason that
always makes me feel better.

271
00:09:36,489 --> 00:09:38,033
- Well yeah, that's chocolate milk.

272
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:38,878
It makes everyone feel better.

273
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,838
- And I was like, I'm
gonna make mac and cheese.

274
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,303
And I walked in the pantry,

275
00:09:42,303 --> 00:09:43,905
we don't have any and I was like,

276
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:45,553
I don't think we've bought mac and cheese

277
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,681
for a year and a half,
- Yeah.

278
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,303
- because it's gross.

279
00:09:49,303 --> 00:09:50,690
It's not good for you.

280
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,496
- It's not gross Ellie.
- I mean it's good,

281
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:55,452
- It's like not the best, you know?

282
00:09:55,452 --> 00:09:56,722
- [Jared] It's not the
healthiest thing in the world.

283
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,762
- And so I was like every house

284
00:09:58,762 --> 00:10:00,192
at least needs like a few boxes, you know?

285
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,025
- [Jared] Right.

286
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,097
- So I made Jared go out

287
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:04,708
and yes, this is my second
box, and I'm eating it.

288
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:05,645
(Jared laughs)

289
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:09,253
- So I've had, thinking back
to the other pregnancies

290
00:10:09,253 --> 00:10:10,380
that we've gone through,

291
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,869
Ellie hasn't had like
really intense cravings.

292
00:10:13,869 --> 00:10:15,134
This is the first time that I've noticed

293
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:17,485
it's like Jared, go to the store,

294
00:10:17,485 --> 00:10:19,381
get this right now.
- Just go get it.

295
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:20,711
- So I had to make a note of it.

296
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:22,452
- Well the reason why I
was so extreme about it

297
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,473
is because,
(knocking)

298
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:24,306
Calvin (laughs).

299
00:10:24,306 --> 00:10:26,441
- [Jared] He's wearing your heels.

300
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:28,558
(Jared laughing)

301
00:10:28,558 --> 00:10:29,704
- The reason why I was so extreme about it

302
00:10:29,704 --> 00:10:31,878
is like I feel so sick.

303
00:10:31,878 --> 00:10:33,795
- Yeah.
- I have to eat.

304
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:36,461
- I feel nauseous.
- Mommy, Mommy!

305
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,985
- all day.
- Look!

306
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,402
- And I've felt that way
for several days, you know?

307
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:41,235
- [Calvin] Dad.

308
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:45,483
- Look look, is that
your brother or sister?

309
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:46,316
Is that the baby?

310
00:10:46,316 --> 00:10:47,186
(Jared laughs)

311
00:10:47,186 --> 00:10:48,558
Is that the baby?

312
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:50,930
You like black and white,
so I wanted to show you.

313
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:51,763
(laughing)

314
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:52,804
- [Jared] You see extra good

315
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:53,951
in black and white, huh, don't ya.

316
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:56,061
Yeah, you're excited.

317
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:56,894
- Jared and I were just
- That's a good girl.

318
00:10:56,894 --> 00:11:01,020
- Looking at the picture,
and I have felt crummy.

319
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,437
I feel like I just look like,

320
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:06,821
'cause that's how I feel.
- You don't look like that

321
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:08,940
- at all I swear it.
- I feel very

322
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,106
- very sick.
- But this is

323
00:11:10,106 --> 00:11:12,753
- So I am eight weeks along.

324
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:15,127
I have the smallest little pudge.

325
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,970
It hit two days before China
that I wasn't feeling well,

326
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,244
throughout the whole day.

327
00:11:19,244 --> 00:11:21,814
And I just darted home from church,

328
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,216
because I could feel it,

329
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,675
it's gonna come.

330
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:27,380
And I used to always just
throw up in a toilet,

331
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,486
and right now that sounds disgusting

332
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:30,984
to put my head anywhere near a toilet,

333
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,897
so I'm just gonna sit here
with my bucket and wait.

334
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:36,032
(laughs)

335
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,529
Uuhh.

336
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:39,597
We were gonna wait to announce

337
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:42,134
and I really feel like we might have

338
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,283
to say something sooner,

339
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,312
because I don't know
how I'm gonna get away

340
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:48,060
with doing daily videos and not doing much

341
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,500
and not feeling well.

342
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,271
And feel like I might have to explain

343
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,560
why I'm sitting on the couch all the time.

344
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,393
(laughs)

345
00:11:56,393 --> 00:11:57,374
I don't know.

346
00:11:57,374 --> 00:11:58,255
Uuhh.

347
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:00,114
I'm just glad we saw a heart beat,

348
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:02,564
because that makes me 1,000 times better.

349
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:03,595
I'm still worried.

350
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:07,603
But we saw a heartbeat and that is amazing

351
00:12:07,603 --> 00:12:11,929
and it is worth every
bit of feeling crappy.

352
00:12:11,929 --> 00:12:14,449
(sweet music)

353
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:16,894
(Ellie laughing)

354
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,117
- [Ellie] Yes.

355
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:18,950
- Oh!

356
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,973
- You have a third grandchild.

357
00:12:22,973 --> 00:12:25,473
(sweet music)

358
00:12:57,436 --> 00:12:59,174
- Eight weeks!

359
00:12:59,174 --> 00:13:00,797
- I didn't want to scare you before China.

360
00:13:00,797 --> 00:13:02,621
(laughing)

361
00:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,454
- I know.

362
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:05,532
- Actually nine.

363
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:06,365
It's actually like nine--

364
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:08,830
- Well no wonder the smells made her sick.

365
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,102
(laughing)

366
00:13:11,102 --> 00:13:13,602
(sweet music)

367
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,143
- Dad and I both want
to tell you something.

368
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:38,976
- Okay.

369
00:13:38,976 --> 00:13:41,690
- Mommy and Daddy, we are pregnant,

370
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,454
we have a baby in my tummy.

371
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:45,399
- Right now?

372
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,545
- Yeah.
= Mmm-hmm.

373
00:13:47,545 --> 00:13:49,720
- Baby.
- And it's starting to grow.

374
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,946
- Is this it?

375
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:51,908
Is this the baby?
- Yeah.

376
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:52,974
- Yeah.

377
00:13:52,974 --> 00:13:54,227
- And guess what?

378
00:13:54,227 --> 00:13:56,240
We went to the doctor
(Calvin vocalizes)

379
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,825
and we saw, and we heard
the baby's heartbeat.

380
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,394
- That means the baby's doing well.

381
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:02,810
- Yeah.

382
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:03,818
- And we wanted to tell you

383
00:14:03,818 --> 00:14:06,138
that you're gonna have
another little brother.

384
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,107
- Or sister.

385
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:08,253
- Yeah.

386
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:11,457
- Maybe it's gonna be another Calvin.

387
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:12,515
- Maybe it'll be another Calvin.

388
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:13,720
- Where's baby from?

389
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,376
- He's the baby?
- Yeah.

390
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:17,681
- And they took a picture of the baby.

391
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:18,894
So that's what the baby looks like.

392
00:14:18,894 --> 00:14:21,909
It's just a little little
little baby under my tummy.

393
00:14:21,909 --> 00:14:23,562
You can hardly even tell.

394
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,394
- Is that the baby's tummy?

395
00:14:25,394 --> 00:14:28,657
- That's Mommy's tummy
and that's the baby.

396
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:30,657
- Is this how big it is?

397
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:32,827
- Mmm-hmmm.
- Mmm-hmmm.

398
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:35,185
- It's like this big
right now in my tummy,

399
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:36,440
so it's really small.

400
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,846
- How big, Mommy?

401
00:14:37,846 --> 00:14:39,030
- And then it's gonna
grow and grow and grow

402
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:41,062
and my tummy's gonna
grow and grow and grow.

403
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,084
Mommy and Daddy are praying really hard

404
00:14:43,084 --> 00:14:46,580
that this baby will stay nice and strong.

405
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,635
- Just like me.
- I'm strong.

406
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,374
- Yeah strong.
- Just like you.

407
00:14:49,374 --> 00:14:52,090
- And me.
- And really strong like Hulk.

408
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,003
- Yeah.
- Yeah yeah,

409
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:53,836
- we want a Hulk baby

410
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:54,902
is what we want.
- Me Hulk.

411
00:14:54,902 --> 00:14:55,808
- Strong baby.

412
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:56,979
(Ellie laughs)

413
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,296
So when you say your prayers,

414
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,390
will you pray for our little baby?

415
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:02,667
For your brother or your sister?

416
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,027
- Yeah.

417
00:15:04,027 --> 00:15:06,137
I don't want a sister.

418
00:15:06,137 --> 00:15:07,428
(laughing)

419
00:15:07,428 --> 00:15:08,973
Is this a sister mom?
- That, baby.

420
00:15:08,973 --> 00:15:10,154
- We don't know yet.

421
00:15:10,154 --> 00:15:10,987
We don't know yet.

422
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:12,209
- We have no idea.

423
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:13,042
- Will you be--

424
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,283
- He wants to see the baby,

425
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:15,317
he's looking in my shirt.

426
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,905
- Will you be happy, if we have a sister?

427
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:18,738
- Yeah.

428
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,488
- Will you be happy, if we have a brother?

429
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:21,842
- Mommy will too.

430
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:25,202
- Mommy, Daddy and Jackson will too.

431
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:26,180
- Oh good.
- Good.

432
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,013
- Yeah we don't care,

433
00:15:27,013 --> 00:15:28,205
we just want a healthy baby.

434
00:15:28,205 --> 00:15:30,422
- Yeah, that is a baby, Calvin.

435
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:31,505
- I love you.

436
00:15:32,697 --> 00:15:34,020
Happy gratulatchins.

437
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,912
- (laughs) Happy congratulations.

438
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:38,163
I love you.

439
00:15:38,163 --> 00:15:39,625
Jackson asked to do something.

440
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:42,439
We said just a minute, we have
to film a clip real quick,

441
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:43,900
and we're like, do you
want to be in the video

442
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,733
or do you want to go play

443
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,431
and he said I want to be in the video.

444
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,135
So he's gonna sit here.

445
00:15:48,135 --> 00:15:51,287
We officially are telling you guys

446
00:15:51,287 --> 00:15:52,827
that we are expecting.

447
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:56,903
- This is crazy, it's
exciting, it's wonderful.

448
00:15:56,903 --> 00:15:59,879
- I feel much better now that
the weeks have progressed.

449
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,407
I'm feeling much better about everything.

450
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:04,174
It is nerve wracking at first.

451
00:16:04,174 --> 00:16:05,326
And I think it's so cute,

452
00:16:05,326 --> 00:16:08,458
every morning, the moment I wake up,

453
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:10,795
Jared says, how are you feeling today.

454
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:13,241
And I'm always like, well
let me get out of bed

455
00:16:13,241 --> 00:16:15,136
and I'll tell you the moment I get up,

456
00:16:15,136 --> 00:16:16,231
how I feel.

457
00:16:16,231 --> 00:16:17,365
- Let me just a--

458
00:16:17,365 --> 00:16:18,646
- Let me wake up first.
- Let me get just going,

459
00:16:18,646 --> 00:16:20,526
- get the cogs rolling a little bit.

460
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:23,146
- But it's crazy.
- We're pregnant.

461
00:16:23,146 --> 00:16:24,662
- We're pregnant.

462
00:16:24,662 --> 00:16:26,096
- Thanks you guys so much for watching.

463
00:16:26,096 --> 00:16:26,929
- We'll see you next time.

464
00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:27,803
- See ya.

465
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:28,636
- Bye

466
00:16:28,636 --> 00:16:29,469

467
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,402
- Bye.

468
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:31,235
- Bye.

469
00:16:31,235 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye bye bye baby.
