1
00:00:00,112 --> 00:00:02,694
- This isn't even our final form!

2
00:00:02,694 --> 00:00:05,111
Whoa there, cowboy! Whoa!

3
00:00:07,036 --> 00:00:08,953
(kiss)

4
00:00:11,612 --> 00:00:14,503
- (Ellie) Calvin? Who are you hiding from?

5
00:00:14,503 --> 00:00:17,023
(murmurs)

6
00:00:17,023 --> 00:00:17,856
From Jack?

7
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:20,464
(laughs)

8
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:23,412
So he doesn't take your cereal?

9
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:24,770
- And dad said to get him.

10
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,016
- [Ellie] Dad said to
get him? He's hiding.

11
00:00:27,016 --> 00:00:28,278
He's hiding from you.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,087
Do you want me to help you do a dad?

13
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:30,920
- Yeah.

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,170
- [Ellie] I'll draw it. D-A-D.

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,667
And now you try it next to it.

16
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,918
- Okay, I can't do a D.

17
00:00:39,918 --> 00:00:40,969
- [Ellie] You can.

18
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:42,102
- No I can't.

19
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:43,379
- [Ellie] You do all the time.

20
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,379
You can trace mine first if you want.

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,493
Well, you got a little sloppy.

22
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:50,253
No, look, one down, go over.

23
00:00:50,253 --> 00:00:51,121
- Like this?

24
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:51,954
- [Ellie] Yep.

25
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:53,728
- I wanna make a X.

26
00:00:53,728 --> 00:00:55,787
- [Ellie] Good morning!

27
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,333
- Is this a X?

28
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,195
- [Ellie] That is an X.
Look Jackson wrote that!

29
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:01,461
You're doing good!

30
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,158
- Okay boys, dad is
taking a break from work

31
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:05,892
and you know what we're going to do?

32
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:06,725
- Yeah

33
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:07,626
- [Jared] What are we going to do?

34
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:08,459
- Play in the snow

35
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:09,899
- [Jared] We are going
to play in the snow!

36
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:12,094
But here's the thing boys,
we've gotta figure out what we

37
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:14,061
wanna do so I have a
question for you, okay.

38
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:15,833
We can build two things,

39
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:20,589
we can build a slide or an igloo fort.

40
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:22,039
What do you want to build?

41
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,872
- Slide

42
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,789
- [Jared] A slide, you wanna
make a slide down the hill?

43
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,021
So we can go sledding?

44
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:26,854
- Yeah

45
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,037
- [Jared] Or do you wanna make an igloo

46
00:01:28,037 --> 00:01:29,162
fort that we can climb inside of?

47
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:29,995
- A slide

48
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:33,180
- [Jared] A slide! Let's go
outside and make a slide!

49
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,766
Let's get all of our winter
clothes on, we'll get

50
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,584
nice and warm and we're gonna make a slide

51
00:01:36,584 --> 00:01:38,037
and I think I know just how to do this.

52
00:01:38,037 --> 00:01:40,587
Last time we've been having
trouble because there's too

53
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:42,367
much snow, it's not packed
enough to actually get

54
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,552
momentum and get going
but I think I can think of

55
00:01:44,552 --> 00:01:47,725
something that will help us
get a nice run down the hill.

56
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,688
Hmmm, well we're all suited up.

57
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,985
Show me your outfits of the day.

58
00:01:51,985 --> 00:01:53,397
You guys are all dressed and warm.

59
00:01:53,397 --> 00:01:55,024
What do got on your neck there bud?

60
00:01:55,024 --> 00:01:57,141
- Question mark Mario scarf.

61
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,879
- [Jared] Your question mark Mario scarf?

62
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,487
Is it keeping you warm?

63
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,873
And you've got your blue scarf on?

64
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,957
So we're out here in the
garage, I thought I had a

65
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,232
big like four by eight piece
of plywood that I could

66
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:09,937
mat down the sledding hill
so it would be like a nice

67
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:12,338
path with some barriers
that I could add to it.

68
00:02:12,338 --> 00:02:14,230
But I can't find it, I
must have gotten rid of it

69
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,235
or something so I think
what we'll do, we've got

70
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,852
our sleds up here, up top
and I think I might just

71
00:02:18,852 --> 00:02:21,079
use that to mat down the area.

72
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,295
The issue that we've been having with

73
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:23,611
our other sledding hills is that

74
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,236
there's too much powder on top,

75
00:02:25,236 --> 00:02:27,637
it's not enough packed snow to get moving.

76
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:30,680
So I think I'll pack it all
first while these kids play

77
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,311
and then we'll have the
ultimate sledding hill

78
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:34,542
and I'll add some
barriers to make you turn.

79
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,970
And then we may go even
further beyond that.

80
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,986
This isn't even our final form!

81
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,263
Oh man, it's bright.

82
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:42,515
I think we've got about a foot
and a half of snow out here.

83
00:02:42,515 --> 00:02:45,698
Grab the sled. What I'm
gonna do is pack it down

84
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:46,531
if I don't slip and fall.

85
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:47,637
(laughs)

86
00:02:47,637 --> 00:02:50,511
All the way down to the bottom.

87
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:53,011
(light music)

88
00:03:04,966 --> 00:03:07,451
I am out of breath.
Okay last but not least,

89
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:09,698
we have the final piece of the day anyway.

90
00:03:09,698 --> 00:03:11,830
It's hard to tell, but
there's a ramp right here,

91
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,701
ah there it goes, right there
that little peak right there.

92
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:14,917
That's a big ramp for a little kid,

93
00:03:14,917 --> 00:03:17,584
a huge ramp for a little kid and

94
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,975
that's going to give us some speed

95
00:03:18,975 --> 00:03:21,703
off the top of the mountain,
the hill backyard slide.

96
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,963
The world's greatest
backyard slide at that.

97
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,283
Jackson, is this the world's greatest

98
00:03:25,283 --> 00:03:27,476
backyard slide, sledding hill?

99
00:03:27,476 --> 00:03:28,309
- Yep

100
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,021
- [Jared] You know, yeah, okay,

101
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:31,655
so let's put this guy to the test.

102
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:34,813
- I have to get on the, the fast part.

103
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,937
- [Jared] Yeah you do, pull
it over, oh you're so strong.

104
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:39,087
Whoa!

105
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:39,920
(laughs)

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,973
Okay, now are you guys
ready? Are you holding on?

107
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,689
Ready, set...

108
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:45,111
(screams)

109
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,188
Whoa, I think we are nearly ready.

110
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:49,821
We have built a little
course and it's only

111
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,367
gotten room for improvement but

112
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,289
most importantly we've got walls.

113
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,848
You can't tell, right over
there, there's a barrier

114
00:03:55,848 --> 00:03:57,658
so they stay away from that fence line.

115
00:03:57,658 --> 00:03:58,595
And go all the way down.

116
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,549
Jackson, are you ready?

117
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,517
Okay Jackson, give us
something good, give us a show!

118
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:03,773
Come on Mr. Olympics, let's go!

119
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:07,023
Okay, here you go, one, two, three, go!

120
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:14,991
Hey, we're getting there,
whoa, 360! 540! 720!

121
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,899
Oh my goodness, hey the
barrier worked, that's great.

122
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,118
Hey, that was awesome bud!

123
00:04:19,118 --> 00:04:21,618
(light music)

124
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,989
Yeah!

125
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:48,489
Are you ready? Set, go!

126
00:04:49,952 --> 00:04:50,785
Yeah!

127
00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:53,726
Here comes daddy!

128
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:57,915
Okay, daddy's stuck!

129
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:58,956
(laughs)

130
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:01,123
Here comes daddy part two.

131
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,545
Daddy's stuck again!

132
00:05:03,545 --> 00:05:06,065
Alright here comes daddy again.

133
00:05:06,065 --> 00:05:07,815
Yeah!

134
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,770
Daddy's having a hard time.

135
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:17,940
Yeah! Good job bud, that was awesome!

136
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:21,292
Okay is this the first official run?

137
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,471
Take a seat maestro, I'm gonna pull ya.

138
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:24,766
So you go fast. Ready?

139
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:25,898
- Push me off.

140
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:27,434
- [Jared] Yeah I'll get you good.

141
00:05:27,434 --> 00:05:28,706
- Turn too fast

142
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:29,934
- [Jared] You'll be okay, ready? Okay.

143
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,028
Look at me. I love you bud.

144
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:32,861
- I love you

145
00:05:32,861 --> 00:05:35,338
- [Jared] Let's go! Here we go!

146
00:05:35,338 --> 00:05:36,668
Oh no he went off trail.

147
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:37,733
Alright let's try that again.

148
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,149
Okay we've got some improvements to make.

149
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:40,522
How about, whoa!

150
00:05:40,522 --> 00:05:41,583
(laughs)

151
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,682
You like that?

152
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:43,858
Okay let's try that again.

153
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:44,757
- Okay

154
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:45,908
- [Jared] You're ready for this?

155
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:46,868
- It made a X

156
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,448
- [Jared] It made an X? Yeah, okay.

157
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:49,966
Dad's gonna push you straight this time.

158
00:05:49,966 --> 00:05:51,276
You ready for round two?

159
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,109
- Yep

160
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:55,629
- [Jared] Okay, here
we go three, two, one!

161
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:58,058
There we go! Go, go, go, go!

162
00:05:58,058 --> 00:05:59,066
Come on!

163
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:01,688
- [Ellie] Jackson and
daddy doing the drone.

164
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:04,562
Calvin couldn't stay out much longer.

165
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:06,636
I've got hot chocolate going and

166
00:06:06,636 --> 00:06:10,197
I would say today is a huge breakthrough

167
00:06:10,197 --> 00:06:11,997
with Calvin and potty training.

168
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:14,566
He has asked to go potty several times.

169
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:15,688
He's in there right now.

170
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:17,656
I'm so proud of him!

171
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:20,134
This process has been
pretty good this time around

172
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,865
just because we have been
like just more calm with

173
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:24,916
it, like it'll come when it comes.

174
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,327
When his potty watch
goes off, we are the ones

175
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,516
that are like, "hey it's time to potty!"

176
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,669
But he is starting to do that more

177
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:32,782
on his own and I'm so proud of him!

178
00:06:32,782 --> 00:06:34,553
- Calvin poop!

179
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:37,487
- [Ellie] Good job! I'm so proud of you!

180
00:06:37,487 --> 00:06:38,414
- Thank you mom.

181
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:42,267
- You're welcome! Should
go pick out a prize!

182
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,324
- Yeah

183
00:06:43,324 --> 00:06:45,824
(light music)

184
00:06:52,347 --> 00:06:54,417
- Did you boys have fun
playing outside in the snow?

185
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:55,250
- Yeah

186
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,505
- [Jared] Yeah? Did you, Calvin? Good.

187
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,367
We had a blast, didn't we?

188
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:00,930
- Calvin kind of came in
before you filmed, huh?

189
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,581
- [Jared] Yeah, he was cold and kept

190
00:07:03,581 --> 00:07:05,131
taking his gloves off so,

191
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:05,964
- [Ellie] Stinker

192
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:06,797
- Yeah, he's a little stinker.

193
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:07,911
We're working on that aren't we?

194
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,219
What you missed, Calvin, was Jackson

195
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:11,927
and I built a ramp at the beginning

196
00:07:11,927 --> 00:07:14,445
of the sledding hill and what did it do?

197
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,186
- It made us go fast.

198
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,295
- [Jared] Yeah it did.

199
00:07:17,295 --> 00:07:18,868
- You were there for the
work but not the fun.

200
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:19,701
- [Jared] Yeah, I know.

201
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,534
(laughs)

202
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:21,768
That's kind of how I feel is like,

203
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:23,772
I did all the work but it's like the snow

204
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:26,168
is like too soft for me
to have any fun with it.

205
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:28,158
(laughs)

206
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,256
- [Ellie] Jackson let's
see your guitar solo again.

207
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:31,505
(screams)

208
00:07:31,505 --> 00:07:32,843
(laughs)

209
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,348
(screams)

210
00:07:35,348 --> 00:07:36,390
- [Ellie] Awesome!

211
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,912
Hey, how was shoveling the driveway

212
00:07:37,912 --> 00:07:40,745
in your cute, little, tight pants?

213
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:43,536
- It's good

214
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:44,562
- [Ellie] Hey, are you tired?

215
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:46,219
Did you get too much hot cocoa?

216
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,942
Did you have fun outside?

217
00:07:47,942 --> 00:07:49,723
The boys are wiped out.

218
00:07:49,723 --> 00:07:52,988
They're watching some YouTube videos.

219
00:07:52,988 --> 00:07:54,444
To show you how cute this is

220
00:07:54,444 --> 00:07:56,861
(soft music)

221
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:00,736
- When lips attack!

222
00:08:00,736 --> 00:08:02,653
(kiss)

223
00:08:06,335 --> 00:08:08,855
(kiss)

224
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,175
Hey stinky boy, it's time for your bath!

225
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:12,008
(screams)

226
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:13,733
You're naked, go get in the bathtub!

227
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,559
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go get in the tub!

228
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:21,476
Well looky here, aren't
you a sight for sore eyes.

229
00:08:21,476 --> 00:08:24,954
It is perfect timing
that we got this today.

230
00:08:24,954 --> 00:08:27,524
My goodness gracious,
so with this pregnancy

231
00:08:27,524 --> 00:08:30,354
when Ellie is up, oh my gosh, she is up!

232
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:33,408
And When she is down,
well, she's, she's down and

233
00:08:33,408 --> 00:08:37,153
I think her energy is
just zapped today so,

234
00:08:37,153 --> 00:08:40,131
I don't often cook, but
when I do, it's usually

235
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:42,929
with Hello Fresh because
the ingredients are all

236
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:46,313
laid out for me,
everything is just so easy.

237
00:08:46,313 --> 00:08:49,601
I've got the instructions
ready to go, divided portions

238
00:08:49,601 --> 00:08:52,453
and it tastes so stinking good.

239
00:08:52,453 --> 00:08:56,356
Inside our box, we have
three meals to choose from.

240
00:08:56,356 --> 00:09:00,209
We've got steak, stir fry and quesadillas.

241
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:01,350
Calvin, which one should we have tonight?

242
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,900
- Um

243
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,005
- [Jared] This one? Steak?

244
00:09:05,005 --> 00:09:07,760
I think that sounds delicious,
oh yeah, that would be great.

245
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,335
On these cards, you have
all of the instructions,

246
00:09:10,335 --> 00:09:13,482
all of the ingredients
and just some fun tips

247
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:16,180
and tricks for making these
the best way possible.

248
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,680
(light music)

249
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,917
- [Ellie] My little heart
strings cannot take this,

250
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,900
watching Peppa, oh it's so cute.

251
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,733
Why did you ruin it?

252
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,178
- I walked over and she saw me,

253
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:42,281
and she was like "oh, hi dad."

254
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,346
- [Ellie] Well that was
really funny, I just posted

255
00:09:44,346 --> 00:09:47,840
the cutest Instagram story ever.

256
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,980
- [Jared] Hey, if you're not
following us on Instagram

257
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,131
or Twitter, you should do
it because I was just gonna

258
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:55,128
say like that's where we give
the most up to date things.

259
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,936
If you wanna know exactly when the

260
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,478
vlog is posted, follow us on Twitter.

261
00:09:58,478 --> 00:09:59,893
- [Ellie] Hey, I wouldn't
trust her around there.

262
00:09:59,893 --> 00:10:00,726
(laughs)

263
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,332
- If you wanna get funny updates,

264
00:10:02,332 --> 00:10:04,532
cute updates, real time, then Instagram.

265
00:10:04,532 --> 00:10:06,249
And here is the final result.

266
00:10:06,249 --> 00:10:07,328
(excited screams)

267
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:08,418
(laughs)

268
00:10:08,418 --> 00:10:09,251
- Yay!

269
00:10:09,251 --> 00:10:10,084
- [Jared] You're welcome.

270
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:10,917
Do you wanna know what the best part is?

271
00:10:10,917 --> 00:10:12,824
It actually looks like the picture like...

272
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,418
(excited screams)

273
00:10:14,418 --> 00:10:17,732
- We got my mom and dad
this for Christmas guys

274
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:19,918
because we've talked about
this like all year long.

275
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:22,781
We had subscription on our own.

276
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:25,789
We love it so I'm happy to have

277
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:27,719
Hello Fresh sponsor today's video.

278
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:28,592
- [Jared] Absolutely.

279
00:10:28,592 --> 00:10:29,485
- It's delicious.

280
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,626
- And Ellie's parents
freaking love it too.

281
00:10:31,626 --> 00:10:32,459
- And they're gonna be really sad

282
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:33,684
when their Christmas gift is up.

283
00:10:33,684 --> 00:10:34,588
(laughs)

284
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,985
- [Jared] Okay mom,
what's the final verdict?

285
00:10:35,985 --> 00:10:37,910
- It's, its how it always is.

286
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,429
- [Jared] So perfect and amazing?

287
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:40,262
- Yeah.

288
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:41,095
- [Jared] Oh I'm so glad you like it.

289
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:44,223
This tastes, it's so good, I love it.

290
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,229
Okay, round two tomorrow.

291
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,813
Alright full disclosure
here, you know that we've

292
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,371
had Hello Fresh for such
a long time but during

293
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:54,595
the holidays we actually
paused our subscription

294
00:10:54,595 --> 00:10:56,548
because we were traveling,
we were with family,

295
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:58,613
we were cooking all the time
different things you know,

296
00:10:58,613 --> 00:11:02,352
different plans that families
have but the beauty of

297
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:04,579
Hello Fresh is that you can pause it

298
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:07,104
and you can resume it, which we have done.

299
00:11:07,104 --> 00:11:10,756
They continue to deliver for
free right to your doorstep

300
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:14,073
in this awesome box with all
of your meals inside of it.

301
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,510
What would you say that
took us, 30 minutes to cook,

302
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,959
I mean, I did the cooking,
I did the cooking.

303
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:22,847
Thirty minutes to cook
the whole thing and it was

304
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:25,763
oh, I just can't it's so,
sounds so weird to say but

305
00:11:25,763 --> 00:11:27,876
it's quick and easy but it is.

306
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:31,800
Whoa there cowboy, you can't
wash the dog in the dishwasher.

307
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,005
- Oh my gosh, trash, garbage.

308
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:36,447
- [Jared] Anyway, what I was
saying, it took about thirty

309
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,774
minutes to cook the meal and
when you've got a pregnant

310
00:11:38,774 --> 00:11:41,885
wife and you don't want to
have to think about your meals.

311
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:42,718
- You deliver.

312
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:44,366
- You have it delivered
to your front door.

313
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:47,765
Ellie literally had a breakdown
for thinking about what

314
00:11:47,765 --> 00:11:51,187
to cook so this just takes
the whole thought process out

315
00:11:51,187 --> 00:11:54,370
of it and into your mouth, it's delicious.

316
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,016

I'm proud to have them
as one of our sponsors.

323
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,296
Like I really am.

324
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,991
This kid, you are so hyper. Yee haw!

325
00:12:14,991 --> 00:12:15,824
- [Ellie] Calvin!

326
00:12:15,824 --> 00:12:16,935
- [Jared] Giddy up cowboy!

327
00:12:16,935 --> 00:12:19,657
- It's like, we know
if Calvin takes a nap,

328
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,855
especially in the later evening,

329
00:12:20,855 --> 00:12:22,301
he's not going to bed at bedtime.

330
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:23,134
- [Jared] Yeah.

331
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,578
- But it's pretty hard
to like, you don't want,

332
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,863
I don't want to force my child to take

333
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:27,486
a nap but if he falls asleep...

334
00:12:27,486 --> 00:12:28,319
- [Jared] Right.

335
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,040
- And I didn't even notice, like he will

336
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,686
just go up and fall asleep.

337
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:32,519
- [Jared] We've gotta see what he's

338
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,655
doing right now, he's into something.

339
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,701
- Hey! Oh my gosh!

340
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,110
- [Jared] How did you get that up fast?

341
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:38,943
- Get out of here.

342
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:40,498
(laughs)

343
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,791
- He is taking all my...you're
demolishing everything!

344
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,271
- [Jared] Hurry before he
demolishes the next room.

345
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:48,478
- No! Oh my gosh.

346
00:12:48,478 --> 00:12:50,498
(laughs)

347
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:53,473
- [Jared] Thank goodness
for these magnetic strips.

348
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,282
I don't know why Apple got rid of them

349
00:12:55,282 --> 00:12:58,431
in the newest one with
the USBC? Yeah, I know.

350
00:12:58,431 --> 00:12:59,454
- [Ellie] Won't be buying that...

351
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:02,643
- [Jared] These have saved so many...

352
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:03,476
