1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,150
- I have figured it out.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,140
I finally made the connection.

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:06,500
This may be the weirdest, coolest,

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,819
most interesting thing we've
ever received in our PO Box.

5
00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:11,706
(Ellie laughs)

6
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,640
- [Ellie] Jackson!

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,600
- The official name for baby Mecham--

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,433
- [Ellie] What's that?

9
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,520
- Hi moon.

10
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,673
- [Ellie] Is it a moon?

11
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:19,506
- Yeah.

12
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:20,901
- [Ellie] It's the sun.

13
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,060
- Sun.

14
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,670
- Whoa, I like getting
(laughs) my kids dressed

15
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,480
and Jackson is like,
no let me get dressed,

16
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,460
so Jackson gets dressed, but
you're still young enough

17
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:33,490
that you like to pick your nose (laughs)

18
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,090
and you let me get you dressed,

19
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,900
which I think is so fun.

20
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,140
So this is actually Jackson's old shirt.

21
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,893
Can you wear Jackson's old shirt?

22
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:43,636
- Yes.

23
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:44,469
- [Ellie] Yes.

24
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:45,886
- Jackson's this.

25
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,163
- [Ellie] And we'll put the sun on too.

26
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:53,197
- His eyes is broke, his eyes broke.

27
00:00:53,197 --> 00:00:54,180
- [Ellie] They didn't break.

28
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,672
They kinda look broke, huh?

29
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:56,505
- [Calvin] Yeah broke.

30
00:00:56,505 --> 00:00:58,400
(Ellie laughs)

31
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,510
- [Ellie] Hey, go and grab your underwear.

32
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,650
I've told you a hundred times.

33
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,691
Go in the bathroom.

34
00:01:03,691 --> 00:01:06,274
(Calvin yells)

35
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,280
Go grab it.

36
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,530
Hurry, go grab it.

37
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,138
- Hi friend.

38
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:13,330
Hey friend,

39
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,587
now that's me--

40
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,093
- [Ellie] Hey Calvin, do
a circle, let's see ya.

41
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,758
Wow, you look so handsome.

42
00:01:24,758 --> 00:01:27,510
(laughing)

43
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,460
- [Jared] Hey Mama.

44
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,570
Are you ready for this?

45
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:32,403
(Ellie groans)

46
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:33,236
- [Ellie] Yes.

47
00:01:33,236 --> 00:01:35,700
- Tax preparation.
- Last appointment, let's go.

48
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,110
- So here's the thing, the
folder says tax preparation,

49
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,740
but I'm not sure we're prepared.

50
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,573
For the beating.

51
00:01:42,573 --> 00:01:44,446
- Hey, remember when we
went and got a hot dog?

52
00:01:44,446 --> 00:01:45,899
Corn dog.
- Yeah.

53
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,570
- We should do that again.

54
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,522
- We should.

55
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:51,780
♪ Corn dogs corn dogs ♪

56
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,923
That's a throw back.

57
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,600
- I don't think I'm ready for this.

58
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,861
- Okay, ready or not, here
we come mister taxman.

59
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:02,539
♪ On the road again ♪

60
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,570

61
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,430
What are you laughing at?

62
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,306
- Nothing.

63
00:02:09,306 --> 00:02:10,463
- We were laughing because it was silent.

64
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:11,867
- [Bonnie] That's a good song, I love it.

65
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,630
- Look, the baby can have all my napkins.

66
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,290
- [Jared] Oh Ellie, you have
reached a pivotal moment

67
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,790
in your pregnancy.

68
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,522
It's a snack tray now.

69
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:20,830
- Totally.

70
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,570
- We are on our way to the warehouse.

71
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,860
You guys know that we
did a giveaway for Bollie

72
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,693
on the Bollie Instagram,

73
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,480
and so we're going out to the warehouse,

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,710
- We're gonna send your items out.

75
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,543
- Yes we are.

76
00:02:30,543 --> 00:02:32,070
Okay, let's stop talking about that

77
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,770
and talk a little bit
more about how you thought

78
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,370
what I was doing wasn't singing.

79
00:02:36,317 --> 00:02:38,572
- It was like a singing screaming.

80
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:40,820
- [Jared] No, it was legitimate singing.

81
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,653
- It was scringing.

82
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:42,486
- It was scringing.

83
00:02:42,486 --> 00:02:43,910
- It was so we could hear you.

84
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,900
- Look, I know I can sing.

85
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,950
- I demand a replay.

86
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,600
- Okay you about, what was
the word you just said?

87
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,433
- [Jared] Singing.

88
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:52,661
- No, scringing.
- Scringing.

89
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,494
- [Jared] Scringing?

90
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:55,000
- Scringing, let me tell you another word.

91
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,390
According to my baby app,

92
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,040
I found out a new word, as well

93
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,891
and it's called snissing.

94
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:00,724
- [Jared] Snissing, oh jeez.

95
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,880
- That's peeing when you sneeze.

96
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,327
- Oh.
- Snissing.

97
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,610
- [Jared] How many times
do you do that a day?

98
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,443
- We've all done it.

99
00:03:07,443 --> 00:03:08,985
I've done it twice this pregnancy.

100
00:03:08,985 --> 00:03:09,860
- [Jared] Oh this pregnancy.

101
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,263
- That time when we were in San Francisco.

102
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:17,410
- There's a Christmas
cemented in my memory

103
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:21,970
that we got my mom to laugh so hard

104
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,860
that she peed her pants so bad,

105
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,370
but when you have six kids, that happens.

106
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,850
- Right?
- That's cute.

107
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,560
- It was like the funniest

108
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,994
and most embarrassing thing ever.

109
00:03:31,994 --> 00:03:33,394
(laughing)

110
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,420
We're in the warehouse.

111
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,418
What were you saying?

112
00:03:36,418 --> 00:03:37,894
- The other wieners.

113
00:03:37,894 --> 00:03:39,120
- The other wieners.

114
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,930
We have four winners from
Bonnie and Joel's channel

115
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,020
and we're gonna do four
winners on our channel.

116
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,853
Okay whose next?

117
00:03:44,853 --> 00:03:46,460
- These are the winners
from our Bollie giveaway.

118
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,596
We have robes and workout
outfits and dresses.

119
00:03:50,596 --> 00:03:52,530
Pakistan is one of them

120
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,270
that we are shipping a robe out to.

121
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,590
- Alright, Kelsey from New Zealand.

122
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,920
What?

123
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,390
We want to go to New Zealand.

124
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,340
Wants a robe, boom, here
you go, just for you.

125
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,128
- Kelsey from Chicago
with an acrylic case.

126
00:04:06,128 --> 00:04:08,042
So we're gonna go back and grab that one.

127
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:09,390
- Hey, Joel's got it right here.

128
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,530
- [Jared] You got it,
wow, that was so fast.

129
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,780
Did you wear that muscle shirt

130
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,200
just so you could show off your muscles

131
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
while lifting the acrylic case?

132
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,750
- I knew I'd be pumping one acrylic case.

133
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,029
- You'll have to forgive us for some

134
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,249
of the pronunciations of these names.

135
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,083
Sorry.

136
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:21,916
- Sanay, I think.

137
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,960
- From Australia.

138
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,950
- Australia!

139
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,633
You're getting a robe.

140
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:26,700
- Yes!

141
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,680
- You guys people love these robes.

142
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,513
- [Jared] I know.

143
00:04:29,513 --> 00:04:30,400
- People are obsessed with these robes.

144
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,346
If you want this size--
- I'm obsessed.

145
00:04:32,346 --> 00:04:33,900
- If you want the size that you want,

146
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,048
you better get 'em because
these are running fast, yeah.

147
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:36,927
- [Jared] They're running out.

148
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,010
- These ones are running lower.

149
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:40,202
Guys, we loved designing the robe.

150
00:04:40,202 --> 00:04:41,035
(Bonnie yells)

151
00:04:41,035 --> 00:04:42,130
That was the funnest

152
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,020
and it's perfect for changing the diapers.

153
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,640
- So many good feedback too.

154
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,500
- Mmm-hmm.

155
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,370
And last but not least,
can we get a drum roll?

156
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,325
Everyone drum roll.

157
00:04:50,325 --> 00:04:51,875
(drum roll)

158
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:52,708
- Elizabeth.

159
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,163
- Elizabeth from South Carolina.

160
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,160
- That's crazy.

161
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,100
Work out clothes.

162
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,220
- Alright, get your work out on girl.

163
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,557
Boom, look at that color.

164
00:05:01,557 --> 00:05:02,620
- The last one.

165
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,490
- Boom, work out clothes.

166
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,420
- So we're gonna send all these items out.

167
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,620
- Congratulations guys.
- Thanks guys.

168
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,130
Thanks for entering guys

169
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,520
and we are shipping these out.

170
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,750
That was fun.

171
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,762
We had our tax appointment
which turned out pretty--

172
00:05:13,762 --> 00:05:14,595
- That was not fun.

173
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:17,070
- Which wasn't as bad as I thought.

174
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,670
We were like oh crap, what
are we getting ourselves into.

175
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:23,399
It was okay, and then this,
it was icing on the cake.

176
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:24,232
- This was fun,

177
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:26,535
this was not comparable to taxes at all.

178
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,700
(laughing)

179
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,533
- This was awesome.

180
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,040
I'm glad we did this after taxes,

181
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,160
so now we're going home, we're like yay!

182
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,530
- Pakistan, that's crazy.
- Can you believe that?

183
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,882
- Canada, New Zealand, where else?

184
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:38,350
- New York, Illinois,
- Canada.

185
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,183
- Yeah everywhere.
- Thank you.

186
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,410
- Thank you guys.

187
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,479
- Congrats on winning.

188
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:42,312
- Yeah!

189
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:44,300
This may be the weirdest, coolest

190
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,470
most interesting thing we've ever received

191
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,000
in our PO box before,

192
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and I'm sure that most of you cannot say

193
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,100
that you've ever had this happen to you.

194
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,450
We got a potato.

195
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,003
A potato in our PO box.

196
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,000
Pretty something.

197
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,620
It's growing eyes, so I'm not sure

198
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,150
how long it took to get to us,

199
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,910
but on the reverse side of it,

200
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:06,690
it says you are one hot potato.

201
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,670
And it is addressed to both Ellie and I,

202
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,100
so whoever sent this,
thank you for telling us

203
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,743
that we are both hot potatoes.

204
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,580
Potato in our PO box.

205
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,657
- You have to run like this.

206
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:20,666
- [Grandpa] Like that?

207
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,010
- [Jared] That's how
you have to do it Dad.

208
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,740
That's how you have to do it?

209
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:26,830
Oh, what do you think Jackson,

210
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,803
did he do it?

211
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,970
Oh (laughs)

212
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,770
You gotta throw a spin in there Dad.

213
00:06:35,134 --> 00:06:36,330
Whoa!

214
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,626
(laughing)

215
00:06:37,626 --> 00:06:39,310
- He stuck his chest out.

216
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,630
Yeah I'm a little nervous Dad,

217
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,070
I don't want you falling
and hitting your head.

218
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,370
I'm more worried about
you than I am Jackson.

219
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,300
So Grandma and Grandpa are going to take

220
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,201
Jackson and Calvin on a
shhh, special little date.

221
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,390
I think they're gonna go get ice cream

222
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,100
or something like that, so,

223
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,430
hey, are you ready to have a special day

224
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,607
with Grandma and Grandpa?

225
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:57,440
- Yeah!

226
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,273
- [Jared] Yeah!

227
00:06:58,273 --> 00:06:59,106
Are you ready to have a special day

228
00:06:59,106 --> 00:06:59,939
with Grandma and Grandpa?

229
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:00,772
- Yeah.

230
00:07:00,772 --> 00:07:02,410
- Yeah.

231
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,793
You're doing the Elaine
dance from Seinfeld.

232
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,073
Hey.

233
00:07:11,323 --> 00:07:12,980
You wanna know something?

234
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,990
Stand up, I wanna tell you something.

235
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,951
I love your shirt.

236
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:17,784
- No.

237
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:20,470
- Yeah, your shirt says welcome sun.

238
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:24,010
And it is truly a good
welcome, become look,

239
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,550
the sun is shining

240
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,650
and it it no longer
snowing, thank goodness!

241
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:33,176
Okay, get out of my house,
have some fun and listen,

242
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:35,610
listen young man, you make sure Grandma

243
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,320
and Grandpa behave, okay?

244
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,560
Hey, you make sure Grandma
and Grandpa behave okay?

245
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,780
- Okay.

246
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,613
- Okay.

247
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:42,960
Our kids think they're having a great time

248
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,130
with Grandma and Grandpa
and they probably are, but--

249
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,200
- They don't have cinnamon rolls.

250
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,300
- No they don't.

251
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,810
They don't have day old cinnamon rolls

252
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,900
that we were supposed to eat

253
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,770
at our meeting yesterday that we did it,

254
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,520
so Ellie and I are eating--

255
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,970
- I just wrapped up activity days.

256
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:00,600
We did bracelets today with the girls.

257
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,170
And one of the girls left and goes,

258
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:06,060
Mr. Mecham is so handsome and fun and nice

259
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,970
and I was like,

260
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,030
she was just talking,

261
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,290
what did she say, she goes,

262
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,373
I'm not surprised that he married you.

263
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:15,240
(laughs)

264
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,480
- Well I'm tellin' ya,
she speaks the truth.

265
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,550
- It was a cute complement to both of us.

266
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:21,750
- Yes it was, it certainly was.

267
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,730
Nearly every time we film
in front of this sign,

268
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,170
a bunch of people mention in the comments

269
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,230
about Cody Shark Dee Dee.

270
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,610
And whether that may or may
not not be our baby's name,

271
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:34,440
I know where it came from, okay?

272
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,750
So obviously Cody is--

273
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,350
- [Ellie] Jackson's favorite.

274
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:39,950
- Yeah, our cousin Cody,

275
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,250
but Shark Dee Dee,

276
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,679
where in the world did that come from?

277
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,700
I have figured it out,

278
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,100
I finally made the connection.

279
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,990
Okay, so our kids watch YouTube kids

280
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,810
and on YouTube kids,

281
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,080
there are songs that they sing

282
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,788
and one of the songs is

283
00:08:56,788 --> 00:09:00,885

That is where Jackson gets it.

00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,480
Cody Shark Dee Dee, officially unofficial.

298
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,740
What's funny about that is

299
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,690
that may be a nickname for him.

300
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't know, maybe we'll
call him Cody Shark.

301
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,549
- Like call him little shark.

302
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:38,382
- [Jared] Little shark.

303
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:39,215
- He might look like a shark.

304
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,048
- What if that's his animal?

305
00:09:40,048 --> 00:09:42,051
- Calvin looked like a turtle

306
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:43,203
for the first year.
- Mmm-hmm.

307
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:45,060
- What if our baby's born with teeth

308
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,063
and that's like okay, we call him Shark.

309
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:48,958
Gross.

310
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:49,984
- Owie, my boobs.

311
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:50,817

312
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,690

Just dancing and singing
and doing his hair?

319
00:10:06,998 --> 00:10:07,831
- [Jared] Yeah.

320
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,610
- 'Cause you're too old to
have your mom comb your hair?

321
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,610
- [Jared] You are too old,

322
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,927
you need to do your own hair today, huh?

323
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,655
- I can't Dad,

324
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,180
because this owie's still here.

325
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,170
- Oh okay.

326
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,040
I don't know what he said,

327
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,271
but his owie's still there.

328
00:10:19,271 --> 00:10:22,020
- Are you done combing it?

329
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,060
- [Calvin] Mom.

330
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,560
- Mom, this is a delicate process,

331
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,560
it takes time.

332
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,393
- Hey, I think we're done,

333
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,790
come bring it back to me please.

334
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,100
- Look, can we get the
whole family in one shot?

335
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,933
Yeah!

336
00:10:33,162 --> 00:10:33,995
(laughs)

337
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:34,828
Where's song?
- The song turned off.

338
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:35,661
- He always says--

339
00:10:35,661 --> 00:10:36,608
- Hey.

340
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:37,663
(laughs)

341
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,948
- [Jared] Look at you.

342
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:42,198
(laughing)

343
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,950
We got hair cuts today,

344
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,123
so we can look fresh.

345
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:50,024
- I think I'm good at doing the hair cut.

346
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,115
- [Jared] What's that?

347
00:10:51,115 --> 00:10:53,750
- I think good at getting a hair cut.

348
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,760
- [Jared] Yes you sure did,

349
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,380
I'm proud of you buddy.

350
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,990
- You are good.

351
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,643
- [Jared] Did you get the
toilet paper in there?

352
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,563
- Yes.

353
00:11:01,563 --> 00:11:02,680
Down there.

354
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,540
- Oh it's down there,

355
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,590
okay we gotta make sure
we get it in the toilet.

356
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,423
And make sure the doggie

357
00:11:06,423 --> 00:11:08,260
doesn't get in the toilet,
right, that's the big thing.

358
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,660
- [Ellie] Okay, everyone's gone potty?

359
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,910
Ready for bed?

360
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,600
- No, I'm supposed to
play with kinetic sand.

361
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,970
- The kinetic sand, guys
they've been playing

362
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,310
with that kinetic sand for

363
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,930
hours.
- Nonstop?

364
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,736
- We just put kinetic sand
in a box, a few rocks.

365
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:26,050
- Fun filled activities for hours on end.

366
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,300
- My friend the other day
recommended this book to me,

367
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,070
it's called You Are Here.

368
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,900
And I got it on Amazon

369
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,700
and I've only read a few chapters

370
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,540
and I've already really liked it.

371
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,330
I feel like everybody
could benefit from it.

372
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:41,060
Lately I've been having a hard time

373
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,640
just with a little anxiety

374
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,880
and it's seriously, it's like
I'm just ready for spring

375
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,260
and the sun to come out

376
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:50,630
and already, it's just
been really fun to read.

377
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,690
And I'm not a huge reader,

378
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,540
so it's been nice to just sit and read.

379
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,080
I usually do that when
I need to decompress,

380
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,150
I will read,

381
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:03,280
but Jared, his decompress, decompression?

382
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,390
This is what he does.
- Got him, oh yeah!

383
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,660
- [Ellie] He's been on Twitch lately,

384
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,720
but Jared
- hey!

385
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,090
- I'll come over there and
say hi, you have to tell me.

386
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,800
When we started YouTube, I
was like, what's YouTube?

387
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,950
And then all of a sudden, I was like,

388
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,280
there's beauty videos on YouTube?

389
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,640
I love beauty videos.

390
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,760
I gotta crawl under here.

391
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,477
I was like, I love beauty videos

392
00:12:20,477 --> 00:12:22,350
and I ended up loving it.

393
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,183
Twitch.
- Yeah.

394
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:25,172
- So Twitch--

395
00:12:25,172 --> 00:12:26,005
- [Ellie] I don't know
anything about Twitch.

396
00:12:26,005 --> 00:12:27,310
- Okay, so Twitch, obviously,

397
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,602
most people think of it as gaming,

398
00:12:29,602 --> 00:12:30,435
- [Ellie] Games.

399
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:31,580
- And a lot of it is,

400
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,530
but a lot of people do
what they call IRL streams,

401
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,760
I know Clintus does that a lot,

402
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,357
where you're vlogging
- chattin'.

403
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,760
- but you're streaming and everything.

404
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,220
Right now, you just came in,

405
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,060
- [Ellie] Is there make-up girls?

406
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,282
- You know, I think there is.

407
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:46,115
I think there is,

408
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:47,040
but there's a lot of people here, look.

409
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,680
We've got Megnog, Chelsea--

410
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,321
- Hi girl.
- Kelly, Spartan Span.

411
00:12:52,321 --> 00:12:53,630
- Because I think it would be fun

412
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,590
to just livestream me getting ready.

413
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,680
Because that's what I love to watch,

414
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,990
but sometimes it's hard to film,

415
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:02,103
because it's like okay,
we've got about 10 minutes.

416
00:13:02,103 --> 00:13:03,020
It's sometimes overwhelming, but--

417
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,530
- You walked in at a
good time and a bad time.

418
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,420
You walked in right when I got someone

419
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,351
and right when I died.

420
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:10,320
(laughing)

421
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,270
- Jared just told me what Jackson does.

422
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:14,400
- So when Jackson and I play together

423
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,233
on the computer,

424
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:17,422
he'll sit on my lap just
like Ellie is right now.

425
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:18,255
- Awww.

426
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,330
- And he'll hit the space bar,

427
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,070
which is jump and he'll hit it for me--

428
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,240
- [Ellie] The guy will jump.

429
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,573
- Yeah I'm on the bus balloon right now.

430
00:13:24,573 --> 00:13:25,406
- So cute.

431
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:26,351
Has Calvin ever sat in here?

432
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:28,359
- He hasn't, you know, he hasn't.

433
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:29,950
- I was gonna say Jackson's
only done it a few times.

434
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,450
That's funny.
- Yeah.

435
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:32,870
- Well that was a ton of fun.

436
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,980
Ellie had a blast.

437
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,460
She actually hopped on the game

438
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,610
and started playing it

439
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,020
and we had a stream with her,

440
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,080
so that was fun evening.

441
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,670
Thank you guys so much
for watching the video.

442
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,503
If you enjoyed it,

443
00:13:42,503 --> 00:13:43,450
be sure to give it a big thumbs up.

444
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:46,360
I'll have my Twitch link in
the description down below.

445
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,200
Let us know what games you
want to see me and Ellie play

446
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,460
or just me play.

447
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,930
And we will see you guys next time.

448
00:13:51,930 --> 00:00:00,000
See ya, bye.
