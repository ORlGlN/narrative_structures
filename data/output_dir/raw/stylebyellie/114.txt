1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:03,031
(bright music)

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:05,281
(laughing)

3
00:00:09,047 --> 00:00:11,297
(laughing)

4
00:00:15,125 --> 00:00:19,174
- [Ellie] Calvin, you
braved the big steps.

5
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,424
Oh my goodness.

6
00:00:25,573 --> 00:00:27,508
(Ellie laughs)

7
00:00:27,508 --> 00:00:29,428
Are you guys having a good morning?

8
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:30,261
- Yeah.

9
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:31,669
- [Ellie] Just playing together?

10
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:32,502
- Uh-huh.

11
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:33,335
- [Ellie] Okay.

12
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,336
Jackson, you look handsome.

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:39,086
Calvin I caught you just in time.

14
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:42,713
No (laughs).

15
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,425
I'm getting the boys ready

16
00:00:44,425 --> 00:00:46,842
and I had to hurry and
go grab some hair gel.

17
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:48,224
Jackson likes to get dressed himself

18
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:50,141
and it is so nice, huh.

19
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,600
I just say, this is your outfit,

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,172
get dressed or you go choose an outfit.

21
00:00:55,172 --> 00:00:56,777
So nice, let's do your hair.

22
00:00:56,777 --> 00:00:58,001
Thank you, okay we're good.

23
00:00:58,001 --> 00:00:59,635
We're good, we paid.

24
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:00,802
Let's go.

25
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:01,873
- There's a choo choo train.

26
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:02,925
- [Ellie] Should we go see it?

27
00:01:02,925 --> 00:01:04,044
- No.

28
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:05,456
- [Ellie] No (laughs).

29
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:08,039
(bright music)

30
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:24,511
I brought the kids on a day date with me.

31
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:27,127
I had to go drop some
stuff off with a friend

32
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:29,136
and I decided to take them to lunch,

33
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:31,591
then go to the Treehouse Museum.

34
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,798
So this is what I am doing,

35
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:36,975
is chasing after these
two, room after room.

36
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:38,534
Calvin is now a police officer

37
00:01:38,534 --> 00:01:40,526
and he's going on a fire run.

38
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:43,294
And Jackson is in the diner tonight

39
00:01:43,294 --> 00:01:45,750
and he is gonna make
me some lovely dinner.

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,397
What are you cookin' tonight?

41
00:01:48,397 --> 00:01:49,568
This is the cutest thing.

42
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,444
We don't come upstairs very much,

43
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,132
when we come here.

44
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:55,322
Ooh that is so gross.

45
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:56,989
That feels so gross.

46
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:01,857
Ah thank you so much.

47
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:03,608
Oh sorry, we can throw that one away,

48
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:05,275
it's unsanitary now.

49
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,026
(cash register dings)

50
00:02:07,026 --> 00:02:07,859
Woo!

51
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,543
(cash register dings)

52
00:02:09,543 --> 00:02:10,376
Woo!

53
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:11,209
(Ellie laughs)

54
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:12,542
- Three dollars.

55
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:15,881
- [Ellie] Oh here.

56
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:17,048
Will two work?

57
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,144
So here's seven.

58
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:21,501
That seems fair.

59
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:22,334
- What's up guys?

60
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:23,829
Hope you're having a great day.

61
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:26,062
You know that Ellie is out
with the boys right now.

62
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,949
I've been in my office all morning long.

63
00:02:27,949 --> 00:02:30,180
I've been editing, I've been
working on other things.

64
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,132
I need a break.

65
00:02:31,132 --> 00:02:32,373
So, while Ellie is gone,

66
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:34,269
I thought of something fun,

67
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:36,526
that's easy, that's simple,

68
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:39,004
but I think it'll mean a lot to Ellie

69
00:02:39,004 --> 00:02:39,837
when she gets home.

70
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:41,117
It's just a little surprise.

71
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:42,228
So come with me,

72
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,885
guys this is a fun little thing

73
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,860
for most people I think,

74
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,205
I think most girls would like this.

75
00:02:48,205 --> 00:02:49,468
We're gonna do a little
surprise for Ellie,

76
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:52,188
something small, but I
think it goes a long way.

77
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:53,728
- See?

78
00:02:53,728 --> 00:02:55,062
Little baby.

79
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:55,895
See, baby.

80
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:00,761
- [Ellie] Are you taking
care of the babies?

81
00:03:03,162 --> 00:03:03,995
- Baby.

82
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,363
Baby hold.

83
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:11,957
- [Ellie] Are you gonna
take care of baby too?

84
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:15,161
Can you believe that this
is what Mommy's gonna have?

85
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,152
- That baby?

86
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:18,954
- Mommy and Daddy,
we're gonna have a baby.

87
00:03:18,954 --> 00:03:21,191
I didn't even know that
this place was in here.

88
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:22,937
I just saw Calvin playing
in here, and I was like,

89
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:25,354
oh this is the hospital area.

90
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,283
Change his diaper, is
that what you're gonna do?

91
00:03:29,283 --> 00:03:30,975
(Ellie laughs)

92
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:32,383
Too soon, too soon.

93
00:03:32,383 --> 00:03:34,031
So cute.

94
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:35,614
- Do this, do this.

95
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:39,648
- [Ellie] Hello, ex-ray please.

96
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,239
You look strong.

97
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,322
(lively jazzy music)

98
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,243
- So that's what we're doing.

99
00:03:54,243 --> 00:03:56,003
We are writing notes for Ellie.

100
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:57,115
As soon as she gets home,

101
00:03:57,115 --> 00:03:58,100
she's gonna see these scattered

102
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,956
throughout the house,

103
00:03:58,956 --> 00:04:01,361
strategically placed so that she sees them

104
00:04:01,361 --> 00:04:03,151
throughout the rest of the day.

105
00:04:03,151 --> 00:04:05,369
Just little messages to maker her smile,

106
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:06,799
to make her feel good,

107
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,103
whether she's having a good day,

108
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:11,412
a great day or a bad day,
it'll make her feel better.

109
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:14,495
(lively jazzy music)

110
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:29,348
- [Ellie] Oh come get it.

111
00:04:29,348 --> 00:04:30,668
- The next thing we have to do

112
00:04:30,668 --> 00:04:32,162
is destroy the evidence,

113
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:33,124
make sure she has no idea

114
00:04:33,124 --> 00:04:35,709
where this came from, or
how this even happened.

115
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:36,774
I've got more here,

116
00:04:36,774 --> 00:04:40,725
I've already set up about
10 or 15 around the house.

117
00:04:40,725 --> 00:04:42,157
You can see there's one right there.

118
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,563
But I'm placing these around the house,

119
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,603
just so she sees them throughout the day.

120
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:48,686
(bright jazzy music)

121
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,716
(groans)

122
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,735
- [Ellie] Whoa, you got it.

123
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,640
(Ellie laughs)

124
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,849
You want me to help you a little?

125
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:05,382
- No no no no no no.

126
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,132
- [Ellie] You got it?

127
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:10,201
You independent little thing.

128
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:12,129
I know you can, but I'm just boosting you.

129
00:05:12,129 --> 00:05:14,129
- No I can do it myself.

130
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:16,069
- [Ellie] I just--

131
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:18,402
- No I want to do it myself.

132
00:05:20,212 --> 00:05:21,235
- [Ellie] Let me.

133
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:22,068
- [Jackson] No!

134
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,651
(Ellie laughs)

135
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,263
- But Jackson, I want to help you.

136
00:05:29,263 --> 00:05:30,096
- Mmm-mmm.

137
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:33,454
- [Ellie] You are doing awesome.

138
00:05:33,454 --> 00:05:35,704
You got it all by yourself.

139
00:05:37,574 --> 00:05:38,407
Good job.

140
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,865
You don't need Mama's help, do ya?

141
00:05:41,865 --> 00:05:42,946
- No.

142
00:05:42,946 --> 00:05:45,279
- [Ellie] But I need a kiss.

143
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,530
You got snot on your nose.

144
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,780
Okay ride away.

145
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:51,591
Ride away Cal.

146
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,911
- Now that that's done,

147
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:55,423
I feel like I should probably get out

148
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,542
of my pajamas.

149
00:05:56,542 --> 00:05:58,846
I've literally woke up, gone to work

150
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,495
and now I'm at this point right here.

151
00:06:00,495 --> 00:06:01,534
I should get out of my pajamas,

152
00:06:01,534 --> 00:06:03,151
maybe I should shower.

153
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,845
I should definitely shower Jared.

154
00:06:04,845 --> 00:06:07,165
No joke, this is bad.

155
00:06:07,165 --> 00:06:09,504
Alright, turn that thing on.

156
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,220
Alright, woo!

157
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,989
Good start to the day, right guys?

158
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:14,932
- I feel like I've been stuck to the couch

159
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:16,308
for a few hours,

160
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:17,516
so I should get up.

161
00:06:17,516 --> 00:06:18,877
The boys are quiet downstairs.

162
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,636
I think they're playing?

163
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:23,053
Um (laughs).

164
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,459
- They're totally playing,
I just checked on 'em.

165
00:06:26,459 --> 00:06:28,872
- Um that or all the toilet paper is like,

166
00:06:28,872 --> 00:06:30,686
they toilet papered the basement.

167
00:06:30,686 --> 00:06:32,249
So we went to Zupas today.

168
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:34,543
And Zupas is 45 minutes ago,

169
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:37,126
so when I go, I really love it,

170
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:40,965
and I used to work at Zupa's
when we first got married.

171
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,565
They have the best soup.

172
00:06:42,565 --> 00:06:44,942
The best soup ever is homemade soup.

173
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,621
But if you go get soup somewhere else,

174
00:06:46,621 --> 00:06:48,468
it's usually not as good.

175
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:50,135
Like Kneaders, I love their food.

176
00:06:50,135 --> 00:06:52,098
I love their sandwiches,
I love their breakfasts,

177
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:55,779
but their soup is always very salty

178
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,045
and it just doesn't taste like nice soup,

179
00:06:59,045 --> 00:07:01,743
but Zupas soup is so nice.

180
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,336
So if you guys have a Zupas,

181
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:06,351
you have to get the mango berry salad,

182
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:08,225
and you have to get the
Wisconsin cauliflower

183
00:07:08,225 --> 00:07:10,337
mixed with the enchilada chile.

184
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:12,016
It is so good.

185
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,192
So I got an extra cup to bring home.

186
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,921
But tonight for dinner,

187
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:19,242
I've been wanting to make some soup.

188
00:07:19,242 --> 00:07:21,121
And did you guys ever eat goulash?

189
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,151
Did you eat goulash growing up?

190
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,619
- Uh kind of, something along--

191
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:25,900
- [Ellie] Did you like it?

192
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:26,893
- Yeah I mean, it was pretty good.

193
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,976
We, our go to thing was--

194
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:31,024
- Spaghetti.

195
00:07:31,024 --> 00:07:33,776
- No, it was like, Mom,
what was it called?

196
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:34,609
I can't remember.

197
00:07:34,609 --> 00:07:36,067
- Like a Ragu?

198
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:36,900
- No.

199
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,061
Minestrone soup.
- What was in it?

200
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:40,332
- Oh that's yummy.
- Minestrone soup.

201
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,520
- That's yummy.
- That was our go-to.

202
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,592
- My mom would make goulash quite a bit

203
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:44,976
in the fall and winter.

204
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:47,372
She'd make soups, but goulash,

205
00:07:47,372 --> 00:07:48,788
I feel like we had more often,

206
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:50,940
because it didn't take as long as a soup,

207
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,780
like it didn't take hours and hours.

208
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,436
So that's what I'm gonna
make tonight is goulash,

209
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:57,217
because that sounds really
warm, comforting and nice.

210
00:07:57,217 --> 00:07:59,353
- [Jared] Hey, what are you doing?

211
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,196
- I'm getting all my notes.

212
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:03,534
- [Jared] Your notes?

213
00:08:03,534 --> 00:08:04,681
(Jared laughs)

214
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:06,236
Your notes?

215
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,884
Whose notes are they?

216
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,026
- Mine.

217
00:08:09,026 --> 00:08:11,710
- [Jared] Okay, well tell me what it says.

218
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,526
- It says poo poo in the toilet.

219
00:08:14,526 --> 00:08:15,835
- [Jared] Oh yeah it does.

220
00:08:15,835 --> 00:08:17,674
Let's see what this one says.

221
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,359
You are a great mom.

222
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:21,205
You're right, it is for you Jackson.

223
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:22,408
- [Ellie] You are a great mom.

224
00:08:22,408 --> 00:08:24,440
- [Jared] You are a great mom.

225
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,592
I think you should get some tips okay?

226
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:27,425
(Jared laughs)

227
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:28,529
- I'm gonna get notes.

228
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:31,025
(stool sliding)

229
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:32,094
- Notes?

230
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:32,927
Get notes.

231
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,308
- [Ellie] Are you getting
notes that Daddy put

232
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,809
all over the house?

233
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,791
- Yeah.

234
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:40,969
- [Ellie] Are they for you or me?

235
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:42,457
- You.

236
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:44,248
I'm taking it down for you.

237
00:08:44,249 --> 00:08:45,666
- [Ellie] Thanks.

238
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:49,471
(running steps)

239
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,869
- [Calvin] See the note.

240
00:08:53,869 --> 00:08:54,702
- Okay.

241
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,431
But I can't reach.

242
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,538
I need something to stand on.

243
00:09:03,452 --> 00:09:04,285
- No.

244
00:09:08,022 --> 00:09:08,855
See.

245
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:13,015
- Let's go find some more notes.

246
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:14,015
There's one!

247
00:09:16,281 --> 00:09:17,114
- Oh yeah!

248
00:09:19,948 --> 00:09:22,531
- Now just find a way out down.

249
00:09:23,487 --> 00:09:26,487
- [Ellie] Wow, you guys got 'em all.

250
00:09:27,981 --> 00:09:29,151
That was so cute.

251
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,383
- [Jackson] Not all.

252
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,098
- [Ellie] Not all, there's more?

253
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:34,348
- Last big one.

254
00:09:36,623 --> 00:09:37,469
Right--

255
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:38,374
(Ellie gasps)

256
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:39,626
- [Ellie] There.

257
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:41,155
I'll grab that one.

258
00:09:41,155 --> 00:09:43,738
First let's turn the lights on.

259
00:09:45,403 --> 00:09:46,320
Here we go.

260
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:49,682
Wow.

261
00:09:49,682 --> 00:09:51,379
Well Jared, you're cute.

262
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:52,379
- Thank you.

263
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:55,019
- I've got my bell peppers cut up,

264
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,936
my onions cut, the water's boiling.

265
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,162
I have not been eating
meat the last few weeks,

266
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,427
but I am gonna put a little bit

267
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:07,096
of ground meat in it, because that kind of

268
00:10:07,096 --> 00:10:09,555
helps the flavor, but I probably
won't eat very much of it,

269
00:10:09,555 --> 00:10:11,447
because it hasn't tasted good to me.

270
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,192
- I forgot, the one
that says you are cute.

271
00:10:14,192 --> 00:10:15,674
- Oh where?
- You told me I was cute.

272
00:10:15,674 --> 00:10:16,978
- And I forgot to write that down.

273
00:10:16,978 --> 00:10:18,466
- [Ellie] Oh boo.

274
00:10:18,466 --> 00:10:19,299
You're cute.

275
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:20,241
That was fun to come home to,

276
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:22,135
and it entertained the
kids for like an hour.

277
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,258
- I know they were looking
all over the place.

278
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:26,125
Jackson's like I want
to look in the garage.

279
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,534
And I was like, I promise
you, there's not one--

280
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:29,667
There is one in the garage.

281
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:31,110
Oh shoot.
- Is there?

282
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,308
- It was the first one you saw.

283
00:10:32,308 --> 00:10:34,405
- Jared cleaned his office
while we were gone today

284
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,037
and he put our ultrasound
picture right here,

285
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,365
which is so cute.

286
00:10:38,365 --> 00:10:39,238
I've showed this to you before,

287
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:43,563
my friend, my neighbor
gave this to me in May,

288
00:10:43,563 --> 00:10:45,290
when we miscarried,

289
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:48,243
and I have been so grateful
and proud of myself

290
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:49,987
that I kept it alive,

291
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:53,587
and I think that that's so cute together.

292
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:56,244
Aw the last one.
- I found it.

293
00:10:56,244 --> 00:10:57,609
- Here you go Pen.

294
00:10:57,609 --> 00:10:59,204
(laughing)

295
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,803
Sometimes when we are cooking

296
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,538
and when we're eating,

297
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:04,990
we will have Penny on a leash inside,

298
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:07,334
just to kind of like teach her,

299
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,167
and keep her away from
jumping, she kinda hasn't,

300
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,883
she still has, but jumping and like

301
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:15,442
being around the food and stuff so.

302
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,439
- The thing is, Penny is still a puppy

303
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,446
and she still does puppy things.

304
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:21,279
- [Ellie] Yes you are.

305
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,207
- And she's not gonna
be 100% in everything

306
00:11:23,207 --> 00:11:25,407
we're teaching her, even
though what we do teach her,

307
00:11:25,407 --> 00:11:26,375
she does it really well so.

308
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,208
- Yeah.

309
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:29,486
But I've actually liked,

310
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:31,193
like when we eat dinner,
we'll sit here and eat dinner,

311
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,048
we'll put her pillow right here,

312
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,249
and we'll put the leash on the ground

313
00:11:34,249 --> 00:11:35,082
with her pillow

314
00:11:35,082 --> 00:11:36,488
and she's been really good to just stay

315
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,753
and I've really enjoyed having her around.

316
00:11:38,753 --> 00:11:41,097
But it's been nice that she's not jumping,

317
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,806
because no one no one
wants to eat my food,

318
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:44,671
because if you eat my food, girl,

319
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,116
I'm not gonna be as happy
as I was a few months ago.

320
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:48,531
- [Jared] Well and you
don't want to eat her food.

321
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:49,364
- I would be angry.

322
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:50,701
And your food's gross.

323
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:54,805
Um Bonnie made me eat the dog's
dog food when I was little.

324
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:56,839
- Oh my brothers made me do that too.

325
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,359
Okay what older sibling hasn't done that

326
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,377
to a younger sibling?

327
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:02,471
- [Ellie] Did they tell
you it was Cocoa Puffs?

328
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,703
- I don't know, I think
they just dared me to do it,

329
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:05,693
so I guess I had a choice.
- Yeah, they put milk in it,

330
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:06,754
they said it was Cocoa Puffs.

331
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:07,897
- [Jared] Awww.

332
00:12:07,897 --> 00:12:10,600
- And of course I knew, but I took a bite,

333
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,463
and I'm like eww, got 'em to laugh

334
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:13,858
and then got Cocoa Puffs.

335
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:14,691
- That's what you like to do,

336
00:12:14,691 --> 00:12:17,009
you just like to make people laugh.

337
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,655
I remember in college,

338
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,898
we had like three meals that we would eat

339
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:23,879
over and over again.

340
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:26,302
One was peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches,

341
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,078
sometimes tuna fish sandwiches.

342
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:29,378
- Loved tuna.

343
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:30,991
- I saw it at the grocery
store today and I was like,

344
00:12:30,991 --> 00:12:31,824
oh I'm craving that.

345
00:12:31,824 --> 00:12:33,545
- Me and you haven't had
a tuna sandwich in years.

346
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:34,689
- It's been awhile.

347
00:12:34,689 --> 00:12:35,849
- We loved eating that.

348
00:12:35,849 --> 00:12:37,437
- We would have, like sometimes

349
00:12:37,437 --> 00:12:40,928
we'd have like chicken
breasts and goulash.

350
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:43,579
And that's what we're eating tonight.

351
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,056
We had goulash so much,

352
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:46,999
because it's cheap and it's good,

353
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:48,153
that I got sick of it.

354
00:12:48,153 --> 00:12:50,334
There's a few of the meals
that we had over and over again

355
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:53,495
that I feel like I couldn't
do for the rest of my life,

356
00:12:53,495 --> 00:12:54,328
but some that I could.

357
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:56,430
Tuna fish sandwiches are
definitely one of the ones

358
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,686
that I could.

359
00:12:57,686 --> 00:13:00,495
Peanut butter and jelly I
think I would get sick of

360
00:13:00,495 --> 00:13:01,468
and maybe goulash.

361
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,604
Yeah goulash, because I
did get sick of goulash,

362
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,316
but I think I could have
tuna fish sandwiches

363
00:13:05,316 --> 00:13:06,613
every day for the rest of my life

364
00:13:06,613 --> 00:13:08,093
and be totally fine.

365
00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:09,934
- [Ellie] Tuna fish with pickles.

366
00:13:09,934 --> 00:13:11,743
- Oh yeah with little relish things.

367
00:13:11,743 --> 00:13:15,418
And toasted bread and potato chips.

368
00:13:15,418 --> 00:13:16,437
You gotta have the potato chips,

369
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:18,201
sometimes you just sprinkle it on there,

370
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:19,423
put it in the sandwich, and
sometimes you just eat it.

371
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,746
- No we got so sick of
peanut butter and jelly

372
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,097
that we went to tuna fish,

373
00:13:23,097 --> 00:13:24,971
and that was like a huge step up.

374
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,697
- That was so nice.
- It was awesome.

375
00:13:26,697 --> 00:13:28,913
- [Jared] I miss college days, don't you?

376
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:29,746
- We had fun.

377
00:13:29,746 --> 00:13:33,157
One time we got into bed at 11 o'clock

378
00:13:33,157 --> 00:13:34,330
and we sat there and I was like,

379
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:37,240
Jared, we should go get Taco Bell.

380
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,186
So we got in the car at 11 at night

381
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,156
and went and got Taco Bell,

382
00:13:40,156 --> 00:13:41,244
and went home and went right to bed.

383
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:42,932
- Yeah yep, because we didn't have kids,

384
00:13:42,932 --> 00:13:44,643
so we could do that stuff.

385
00:13:44,643 --> 00:13:45,539
- It was fun.

386
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,372
- [Jared] It was fun.

387
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,663
- And when we got locked out.

388
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:48,601
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

389
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:50,150
- And we had to like,

390
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:54,133
it was like midnight, and the
person with the extra key,

391
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,468
you can't knock after midnight.

392
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,371
- It was after hours, yeah.

393
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:59,681
And we went to the John Mayer concert,

394
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,897
my buddy Nick got us concerts.

395
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:03,223
- And I was mad that night,
I felt bad, I do remember.

396
00:14:03,223 --> 00:14:04,260
- [Jared] Why were you mad?

397
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,246
- Oh I should've just lightened up,

398
00:14:05,246 --> 00:14:08,468
but it was cold, and I was
like, why did we lose the key?

399
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:10,807
- Oh after the fact, after the fact.

400
00:14:10,807 --> 00:14:12,247
Well yeah, you were locked out

401
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:13,080
and it's freezing cold,

402
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,724
I can see why you would get mad.

403
00:14:14,724 --> 00:14:18,530
So what we did, is we kicked
out the air conditioning unit

404
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,977
in the window.
(Ellie laughs)

405
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:22,950
I sliced my hand open and
was bleeding everywhere,

406
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:24,924
but we finally got in.

407
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:26,191
Oh my gosh.

408
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:28,619
I still remember cutting
myself on the air conditioner.

409
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:29,834
Oh it hurt so bad.
- Yeah.

410
00:14:29,834 --> 00:14:30,667
(bright jazzy music)

411
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,671
- [Calvin] I did poo.

412
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:34,085
- [Jared] What?

413
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,729
- I did poo poo.

414
00:14:35,729 --> 00:14:37,886
- [Jared] Did you go poo?

415
00:14:37,886 --> 00:14:38,908
- See?

416
00:14:38,908 --> 00:14:41,714
- [Jared] (laughs) I want to see.

417
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,547
(Jared laughs)

418
00:14:43,547 --> 00:14:44,719
- I seriously was like--

419
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,039
(toilet flushes)

420
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,289
(laughing)

421
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,328
- [Jared] Good job.

422
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:52,311
- I was like get in bed.

423
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:54,374
Of course that's what every parent does,

424
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,431
like 10 times when they
put their kids to bed.

425
00:14:56,431 --> 00:14:57,546
Or at least us.

426
00:14:57,546 --> 00:15:00,022
And he's like I pooed.

427
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,120
And I was like did you go poo?

428
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,576
'Cause every time he goes poo,

429
00:15:02,576 --> 00:15:04,682
it's like let's sit on the toilet.

430
00:15:04,682 --> 00:15:06,882
But this time you waited.

431
00:15:06,882 --> 00:15:09,314
- [Jared] You waited to go poo, huh?

432
00:15:09,314 --> 00:15:10,725
You are so proud of himself,

433
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:12,141
I could hear him talking downstairs

434
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,232
when I was putting Calvin to bed.

435
00:15:14,232 --> 00:15:15,162
- Jackson.

436
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:16,145
- I poo.

437
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,448
I poo.

438
00:15:17,448 --> 00:15:19,206
- And the thing with Calvin is,

439
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,583
he's totally ready to
start potty training.

440
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,478
He's been loving it.

441
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:26,050
He's been warmed up to it
for well over two months.

442
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:26,966
- [Jared] Yeah.

443
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:31,047
- But I've been thinking,
do I start it now?

444
00:15:31,047 --> 00:15:33,416
Do I start working on him now?

445
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,670
Or do I wait until, do I wait a month,

446
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,144
and wait until January, so
it's like the busyness is done,

447
00:15:39,144 --> 00:15:40,546
because it's like
- Yeah.

448
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:44,310
- for a good little bit,
and so I don't know.

449
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,076
I think he'll be just as good

450
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:48,886
in a month to start or now.

451
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:49,719
I just wonder.

452
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:50,763
- [Jared] I think if we
just do a little here,

453
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,596
a little there.

454
00:15:51,596 --> 00:15:52,429
- Yeah.

455
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:53,722
- [Jared] Kinda ease him into it a little.

456
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:54,770
- I just definitely don't want

457
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:55,603
to push him into it.

458
00:15:55,603 --> 00:15:58,888
I feel like Jackson did
such a good job with peeing.

459
00:15:58,888 --> 00:15:59,911
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

460
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:01,109
- He had a really hard time,

461
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:02,649
like pooping was a struggle for him.

462
00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:04,512
We saw lots of doctor appointments,

463
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,080
he had bad constipation issues,

464
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,779
but when we worked through those,

465
00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:09,171
now he's a champ.

466
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:11,444
- [Jared] (laughs) What he
said when he flushes it.

467
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:14,187
- Every time he flushes, bye
bye poop, I'll miss you (kiss).

468
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:15,732
And then he flushes.
- And flushes it.

469
00:16:15,732 --> 00:16:17,119
- It is the funniest thing,

470
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,247
and I have no idea where he got that from.

471
00:16:19,247 --> 00:16:21,415
We certainly don't do that Ellie.

472
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,718
- No we don't.

473
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:24,257
- [Jared] Goodnight.

474
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:25,105
- Bye.

475
00:16:25,105 --> 00:16:25,938
- Bye.

476
00:16:25,938 --> 00:16:26,771
I got out of my pajamas today,

477
00:16:26,771 --> 00:16:28,313
so it was a good day.

478
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:30,167
Thanks for watching guys
and we'll see you next time.

479
00:16:30,167 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
