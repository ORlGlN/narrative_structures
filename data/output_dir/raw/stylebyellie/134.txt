1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:03,716
(quirky electronic music)

2
00:00:20,052 --> 00:00:20,885
- Good morning.

3
00:00:20,885 --> 00:00:22,780
After our massages last night,

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,164
Jared woke up and he said his back

5
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:26,963
feels like a big bruise.

6
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:28,260
- I seriously got beat up.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,308
Like I got beat up.

8
00:00:29,308 --> 00:00:30,603
And I'm afraid to take off my shirt,

9
00:00:30,603 --> 00:00:32,409
because I feel like I'm gonna be bruised.

10
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:33,243
Should we check?

11
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:34,076
- [Ellie] Yes.

12
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,198
Your neck looks red.

13
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:36,357
- It's so tender, ow, careful.

14
00:00:36,357 --> 00:00:37,676
(laughs)

15
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:39,130
Her thumbs are so sharp, like all--

16
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,777
- [Ellie] Your neck is red, though.

17
00:00:40,777 --> 00:00:44,281
- All of this right
here is tender to touch.

18
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,463
- [Ellie] Aww.

19
00:00:45,463 --> 00:00:47,791
- We are on day two of our trip to China.

20
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,811
We just finished up in Guangzhou

21
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,374
and now we're driving
in this tiny little bus.

22
00:00:52,374 --> 00:00:53,409
Hi.
- It's huge.

23
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:54,242
- It's huge.

24
00:00:54,242 --> 00:00:55,075
(laughing)

25
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:58,026
- Well when you think of
a big yellow school bus.

26
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,542
- We're just all riding
on the short bus, Jared,

27
00:00:59,542 --> 00:01:00,650
there's nothing round about it.

28
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,666
- Anyway, we're going to Dongguan?

29
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,701
- Dongguan.

30
00:01:03,701 --> 00:01:04,534
- Dongguan.

31
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:06,956
And it's Friday, no it's Saturday.

32
00:01:06,956 --> 00:01:08,765
Oh my gosh, my days are all messed up.

33
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:10,580
So it's Saturday.

34
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,945
And we're having some fun today.

35
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:13,431
So we've got about a two hour bus drive,

36
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:16,779
because the traffic is pretty intense.

37
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:19,771
It's crazy to see the differences

38
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,833
about how everyone travels

39
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,536
and even just the scenery outside.

40
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:25,209
It's pretty cool, it's
pretty amazing to see.

41
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:27,792
(bright music)

42
00:01:31,155 --> 00:01:31,988
- I have got

43
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:33,375
- Wait wait, we have sticks.
- Oh my gosh.

44
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,243
- The Ikea jelly cookies,

45
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:37,138
which are to die for.
- Oh there you go.

46
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,626
- [Ellie] Those are good.

47
00:01:38,626 --> 00:01:40,227
I have some Kind bars.

48
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:41,205
- [Jared] Okay.

49
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:43,183
- And a pack of Hot Tamales.

50
00:01:43,183 --> 00:01:44,322
- Okay hold on.

51
00:01:44,322 --> 00:01:45,928
I've got some Skittles.

52
00:01:45,928 --> 00:01:48,184
I've got a couple Clif bars

53
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:51,526
and a Sunbelt Bakery
chocolate chip granola bar.

54
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:53,239
- I traded that last time.

55
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,977
- Yeah, oh that's right, I do remember.

56
00:01:54,977 --> 00:01:58,276
Oh and then a Builder's
Protein bar from Clif.

57
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:00,388
- We just gave you a Ferrero Rocher.

58
00:02:00,388 --> 00:02:01,221
- A what?

59
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,415
- Ferrero Rocher, we did just--

60
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,826
- I just gave her.
- Yeah, she gave it to her.

61
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,817
- No that was in kind,
that was given in kind.

62
00:02:05,817 --> 00:02:07,272
- [Jared] That was to initiate the, okay.

63
00:02:07,272 --> 00:02:09,394
- Out of the goodness of my heart.

64
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:10,769
- Of my heart.

65
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:13,503
- Maybe then just make it even

66
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:15,968
and take the Clif bar.

67
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:17,628
- I'm okay.

68
00:02:17,628 --> 00:02:18,882
- Rejected the trade.

69
00:02:18,882 --> 00:02:20,683
Okay, we're done here.

70
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:21,735
We're done here.
- Dangit!

71
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:22,901
- [Jase] No Jared!

72
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:24,251
- I'm not taking any of that.

73
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:27,418
(bright lively music)

74
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:45,540
Oh my gosh, look at that Ellie.

75
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,859
This looks so cool.

76
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:50,213
- We are ready for some lunch.

77
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:52,187
(bright music)

78
00:02:52,187 --> 00:02:55,218
Jackson, it's a pinchy crab.

79
00:02:55,218 --> 00:02:58,208
- [Jared] It's a pinchy crab.

80
00:02:58,208 --> 00:02:59,875
- I'm a pinchy crab.

81
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,710
We're eating lunch with
our group of friends

82
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,863
and our friends that we actually just met.

83
00:03:06,863 --> 00:03:10,521
Our friends Jase and T are
good friends with them,

84
00:03:10,521 --> 00:03:13,468
but Bonnie and I and our
spouses just met them today.

85
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,250
So everyone's ordering lunch,

86
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,316
because we obviously
don't know what to order

87
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,482
and they are experts.

88
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:22,490
So we are having a very
good Chinese lunch.

89
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,811
And we just learned a
few good etiquette things

90
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,395
that you should do in China.

91
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:28,714
- Yep, in terms of the culture, we're--

92
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:31,609
- We're all cringing a little.

93
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:32,442
- Yeah.

94
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:33,275
- So we just learned a few things,

95
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:37,442
but nobody's gonna eat
until the leader eats first.

96
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,266
- Hopefully we don't screw it up

97
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,137
even more than we already have.

98
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,361
- No we have a little bit,

99
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:42,522
but I think things are good.

100
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:44,469
They're all talking and
figuring lunch out, so.

101
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:46,319
- They just came around
and poured hot water

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,935
in our glasses and we're trying to decide

103
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,791
if that's for us to drink,
or to clean our dishes with.

104
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,177
And I think it's for us to drink.

105
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:54,360
- [Ellie] Yeah.

106
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,275
- Is this the one we're supposed to drink?

107
00:03:55,275 --> 00:03:56,390
- Yeah, this is totally drinkable.

108
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,289
- [Ellie] He was saying
how they don't drink cold.

109
00:03:58,289 --> 00:03:59,122
- Yeah well, they don't drink cold,

110
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:02,991
because from the tap, it's
not good drinking water.

111
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:04,394
They always boil their water.

112
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:05,397
- Yeah, so you usually
drink hot water here.

113
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:06,912
- So they're used to
drinking hot water, yeah.

114
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,537
- Thank you for bringing us in,

115
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:10,000
thank you so much for lunch.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,833
We appreciate it.

117
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,750
(speaking in foreign language)

118
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:18,934
(speaking in foreign language)

119
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:20,242
- Yeah, he said it's a normal thing,

120
00:04:20,242 --> 00:04:21,075
but thank you.

121
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:23,408
- No, thank you.
- We're very grateful.

122
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:24,241
- This is chicken feet.

123
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:27,293
Matt, I'm doing this because
you had chicken feet soup.

124
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:29,293
I'm eating chicken feet.

125
00:04:32,246 --> 00:04:34,996
(Ellie laughing)

126
00:04:37,563 --> 00:04:39,230
- [Bonnie] So funny.

127
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,972
- We're in this marketplace
and we're just--

128
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:47,072
- Don't you see?

129
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:48,638
All the certified Motorola's,
they come and get every

130
00:04:48,638 --> 00:04:49,843
individual little piece for it.

131
00:04:49,843 --> 00:04:51,395
- And they just build phones

132
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:52,555
and make 'em right here on the spot.

133
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:54,038
- Yeah, I'll take you to that spot.

134
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:54,897
- That's so cool.

135
00:04:54,897 --> 00:04:57,036
Like anything, anything over here,

136
00:04:57,036 --> 00:05:00,110
all these tiny little parts everywhere.

137
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,194
Look at all that.

138
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:03,499
And that is totally
not a real Apple store.

139
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:04,495
That is a (laughs)

140
00:05:04,495 --> 00:05:05,551
- [Jase] Well yeah, no.

141
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:07,616
- [Jared] Yeah, that is
such a fake Apple store,

142
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,449
that's so funny.

143
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,048
- Well you know how it's a fake one?

144
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:11,081
'Cause there's another one right there.

145
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,566
- 'Cause there's another one right there.

146
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:13,817
- Oh wait, there's
another one right there.

147
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,559
- What the heck, this is so funny.

148
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:17,906
Everyone hit it ready?

149
00:05:17,906 --> 00:05:19,729
♫ Go up

150
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,653
♫ And they stay there

151
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:22,746
♫ And they stay there

152
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,058
♫ And they stay there

153
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:26,744
♫ Up down up down up down

154
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,094
♫ 'Cause all I do is win

00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,643
♫ Ludacris goin' down on the verse

00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:33,508

Hey!

161
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:38,214
(Jared laughing)

162
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,649
- We are now on Instagram.

163
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,290
We are worldwide famous now.

164
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,118
- Yeah, woo!
- You were cute.

165
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:46,201
- I like you.

166
00:05:47,143 --> 00:05:49,117
Jared and I are just sitting down,

167
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:50,923
waiting for everybody to
come out of the building.

168
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:55,090
Everyone's kinda shopping
and this is where we're at.

169
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:59,721
It's just fun to watch and see how people

170
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,768
do things here, you know?

171
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:03,433
- To watch life work here is--

172
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:04,895
- In another part of the world.

173
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,953
- Yeah, it's so

174
00:06:06,953 --> 00:06:09,233
I guess like educational is the best word.

175
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,966
Like it's cool to experience a culture

176
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:13,796
that's completely different
than what you're used to.

177
00:06:13,796 --> 00:06:14,629
- Yeah.

178
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:15,462
- I like it a lot.

179
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,898
- What's the thing that
has surprised you the most?

180
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,121
- Probably how much smoking there is.

181
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:21,077
Like everyone smokes
and there's a lot of it.

182
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:21,910
- Yeah.

183
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,977
- It's interesting walking into a place

184
00:06:23,977 --> 00:06:25,563
and people see your blond hair

185
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:26,889
and everyone's looking.
- Yeah.

186
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:29,001
- Yeah, someone asked
me if I was from Russia.

187
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:29,834
- Yeah.

188
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:31,623
- They thought you were Russian,

189
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,456
- Yeah.

190
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,289
- which was funny.

191
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:34,122
I love it,

192
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:37,037
it's a new experience

193
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:39,390
and I want to do things like this more.

194
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,223
- Yeah.

195
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,910
- We were dancing in that music store

196
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,118
and apparently it's on
their social media network

197
00:06:45,118 --> 00:06:46,975
and it's being shared around right now.

198
00:06:46,975 --> 00:06:47,865
- Oh my god,
- Oh my gosh.

199
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,260
- [Jared] What the heck?

200
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,093
- I looked over there.

201
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:50,926
- [Richie] No there was
like six people filming us.

202
00:06:50,926 --> 00:06:52,292
- When we was dancing, there was a crowd.

203
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:55,179
At least three or four people filming.

204
00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:56,012
- [Ellie] That's hilarious.

205
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:56,996
- Well my internet connection's
not very good right now.

206
00:06:56,996 --> 00:06:59,635
- That's okay, that's funny, though.

207
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:02,075
- [Jared] That is so funny.

208
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:03,279
- On WiFi we'll be able to look at it.

209
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:05,559
- So we're like Chinese
celebrities right now.

210
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,392
- (laughs) No.

211
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,797
- We're not Chinese, but
we're celebrities in China.

212
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:11,244
- The word for that in
Chinese is (speaking Chinese).

213
00:07:11,244 --> 00:07:14,827
It means you've almost made
it, that everyone knows you,

214
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,250
but you're not quite there.

215
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,083
- [Jared] Not quite there.

216
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,542
(speaking in Chinese)

217
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,836
- That's so funny.
- That's funny.

218
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:24,449
- [Jared] This is your key to
happiness and also the metro.

219
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:25,782
- Single ticket.

220
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:30,265
- Oh, you already have one?

221
00:07:30,265 --> 00:07:31,682
Who gave you one?

222
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:34,290
- Sneaky sneaky.

223
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,790
(bright electronic music)

224
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,229
- We're walking around downtown,

225
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:49,025
looking for a place to eat.

226
00:07:49,025 --> 00:07:50,385
There was a Burger King (laughs)

227
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:52,047
that everyone wanted to go to.

228
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:53,404
I think it sounds kinda funny,

229
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:55,492
go to a Burger King while you're in China.

230
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:58,463
But they tore it down,
things change so fast here.

231
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,392
They said that Shenzhen five years ago,

232
00:08:00,392 --> 00:08:02,309
nothing like this was here

233
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:04,885
and everything has changed
within the last five years.

234
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,084
And it's like this booming metropolis,

235
00:08:06,084 --> 00:08:08,957
everyone's like high fashion over here,

236
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:11,339
just a little bit different
than what it was five years ago.

237
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:12,807
- This is so cool!
- Alright.

238
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:15,003
- It's time to get your exercise on.

239
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:15,836
- Woo!

240
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,092
- [Jared] You guys ready to work out?

241
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:17,925
- And it's line music,

242
00:08:17,925 --> 00:08:20,584
I've been waiting to hear this.

243
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,079
- [Jared] Oh here you go.

244
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:25,224
(lively electronic music)

245
00:08:25,224 --> 00:08:27,807
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

246
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,243
(singing in Chinese)

247
00:08:38,645 --> 00:08:39,728
This is epic.

248
00:08:43,844 --> 00:08:45,511
This is really good.

249
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:48,611
It is really good.

250
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:52,093
(Ellie laughing)

251
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:54,704
- [Ellie] This is fun.

252
00:08:54,704 --> 00:08:55,645
- [Jared] So you see
the people in the white

253
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:56,628
and the blue there?
- Yeah.

254
00:08:56,628 --> 00:08:58,003
- [Jared] They're the ones
who are like leading it.

255
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,356
- [Ellie] I love it.

256
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:02,498
Jase and T brought us
to one of their clients.

257
00:09:02,498 --> 00:09:03,738
And this is Helen.

258
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:04,894
Hi Helen.

259
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:05,811
Hi.
- Oh hi.

260
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:08,860
- [Ellie] She is drawing.

261
00:09:09,932 --> 00:09:11,372
- [Jared] This is my suit.

262
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:12,523
- [Ellie] Jared's suit.

263
00:09:12,523 --> 00:09:15,203
And she had the boys pick out fabric.

264
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:16,731
- This is the fabric that I picked out.

265
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:19,437
So it's like a nice gray,

266
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,877
but it also has some texture to it.

267
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:21,931
- [Ellie] Yes.

268
00:09:21,931 --> 00:09:23,166
- Woops, sorry Helen, I
didn't see that was your arm.

269
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:26,977
- [Ellie] And you, Joel and
Jase are gonna be getting suits.

270
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:27,894
- Matching?

271
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,327
- What are you doing?
- I don't know, matching?

272
00:09:30,327 --> 00:09:31,479
- I get really loud,

273
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:33,840
like I get gray with orange plaid.

274
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,670
Or gray with pink plaid.
- Like this?

275
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,503
- Gold?

276
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:40,106
- You know what, that's like anaconda.

277
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,606
(whimsical playful music)

278
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:48,638
- Stop staring at Jared.

279
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:51,388
(Ellie laughing)

280
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:58,870
I swear, we don't even
capture the funny moments.

281
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,038
- Ahhh.

282
00:10:00,038 --> 00:10:01,038
Oh Susannah.

283
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,451
- [Ellie] The ladies
just out here chattin'.

284
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:04,292
- Yep.
- Yes.

285
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:05,440
- [Ellie] Are we all like dead?

286
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,273
- We're so dead.

287
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,106
We're so tired.

288
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,424
- [Ellie] I feel like I
haven't been peppy, but,

289
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:09,639
- I know.

290
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,656
It's kinda hard to be when you're tired.

291
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:11,723
(laughs)

292
00:10:11,723 --> 00:10:13,699
And we're only on day three.
- We have had fun,

293
00:10:13,699 --> 00:10:16,646
- it's just the end of the night.

294
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:17,479
- It's go go go time.

295
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:18,312
- She did it.

296
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:19,145
- Yeah.

297
00:10:19,145 --> 00:10:20,077
- President Bush's jacket.

298
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,568
Same person who just measured me,

299
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:26,568
got all up in here, made
one for President Bush.

300
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,787
George W.

301
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:30,547
- But there was no exchanging of stones.

302
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,579
- That is a private experience,

303
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:36,098
when we had our massage yesterday.

304
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:36,960
Do I even say it?

305
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,793
- [Ellie] Yeah, tell 'em.

306
00:10:37,793 --> 00:10:39,083
- Okay, what happened yesterday

307
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:42,023
was probably the most invasive
thing of my entire life.

308
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:43,452
It was crazy.
- Oh man.

309
00:10:43,452 --> 00:10:45,470
- So we had these hot stones

310
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,974
and they put 'em on
our back and everything

311
00:10:46,974 --> 00:10:49,924
and I kid you not, I kid you not,

312
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,439
- I have to walk away.
- The lady--

313
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:54,637
- Took my bum cheeks, pulled them open,

314
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,614
took the hot stone and put it in,

315
00:10:57,614 --> 00:10:59,253
put it in my bum crack

316
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:01,013
and then closed my bum cheeks over it.

317
00:11:01,013 --> 00:11:02,370
- [Ellie] And were you like uh-oh.

318
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,528
- I went (gasps),

319
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:05,361
ah, oh.

320
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:07,840
- [Ellie] And then she took it out.

321
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,390
- And then she took it out.

322
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,302
I kid you not.

323
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:12,787
And there was one point in time,

324
00:11:12,787 --> 00:11:13,902
because she had multiple stones

325
00:11:13,902 --> 00:11:15,428
so she did that one time,

326
00:11:15,428 --> 00:11:16,595
and I'm not sure sure if
she used it as a place

327
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:18,257
to like, I'm just gonna
put the stones here

328
00:11:18,257 --> 00:11:19,461
so they have a place to go.

329
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,997
- No.
- Oh my gosh.

330
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:23,381
- She did two, she opened it up

331
00:11:23,381 --> 00:11:25,326
and put two stones in there, closed it up.

332
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:26,161
- [Ellie] That's the weirdest.

333
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,465
- It was crazy.

334
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:28,298
Hi Helen.

335
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:29,298
- Hello, hi.

336
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:32,277
- Helen, this is my wife Natalie.

337
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,105
(speaking in Chinese)

338
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:35,036
- Nice to meet you.

339
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:36,056
- [Natalie] Nice to meet you.

340
00:11:36,056 --> 00:11:38,454
- Also, I don't even know
if we've introduced Natalie.

341
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:39,287
Hi guys.

342
00:11:39,287 --> 00:11:41,044
- We haven't done proper
introductions of anyone.

343
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:44,060
So we've got, everyone but

344
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,343
Should we do introductions right now?

345
00:11:45,343 --> 00:11:46,195
- [Ellie] Hurry, yeah.

346
00:11:46,195 --> 00:11:48,677
- So I want to introduce
you to Natalie and Richie.

347
00:11:48,677 --> 00:11:49,510
- [Ellie] Hi.

348
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,770
- We're super sweaty, we just ran

349
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,258
- It's okay.
- All through streets.

350
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:53,359
- It's Chinese sweat though,
so it's good for you.

351
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,020
- [Ellie] Natalie is so so sweet.

352
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,853
- Aww.

353
00:11:55,853 --> 00:11:57,116
- And Richie is so so--
- Not.

354
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,524
(laughing)

355
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:00,318
- Hey it is funny, you
guys really are opposites.

356
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:03,801
Like you're sweet and positivity,

357
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:05,452
and he's kinda harsh.
- It's sweet and sour,

358
00:12:05,452 --> 00:12:06,693
just like dipping sauce

359
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:07,756
for Chinese food, know what I'm saying?

360
00:12:07,756 --> 00:12:09,323
Know what I'm sayin'?
- Totally.

361
00:12:09,323 --> 00:12:10,831
- You guys are so funny.
- Know what I'm sayin'?

362
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,235
- They live in Hawaii.

363
00:12:12,235 --> 00:12:13,835
And do you guys have a vlog?

364
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:15,486
- We do, it's called Rukuslist,

365
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:17,287
just like it sounds, Rukuslist.

366
00:12:17,287 --> 00:12:19,357
And we just started a couple months ago,

367
00:12:19,357 --> 00:12:20,678
but we make cool stuff.

368
00:12:20,678 --> 00:12:21,511
- [Ellie] You do,

369
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:22,596
- We make cool stuff.

370
00:12:22,596 --> 00:12:24,891
- Especially Natalie's Instagram.

371
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:26,424
- [Natalie] Yeah, I'm the winner.

372
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:28,482
- Everything he said
- Ellie is like

373
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:29,316
- I move back to her.

374
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:30,419
(laughing)

375
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,495
But he's really fun too.

376
00:12:31,495 --> 00:12:34,024
- Pro Natalie, Ellie's like
oh I'm all about Natalie.

377
00:12:34,024 --> 00:12:36,178
- Pro Natalie, anti Richie.
- We love him.

378
00:12:36,178 --> 00:12:37,011
- We like you.

379
00:12:37,011 --> 00:12:39,480
He's been making me laugh
all night with his jokes.

380
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,810
He's kind of harsh.

381
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,701
- Then we have Rachel and Jase

382
00:12:43,701 --> 00:12:46,033
from the Ohana Adventure.
- Hi.

383
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:48,124
- Aloha, I mean hello.

384
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:48,957
- [Richie] Hello.

385
00:12:48,957 --> 00:12:50,053
- Yeah, we've all just been hanging out.

386
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:50,886
- [Ellie] And T.

387
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:51,719
- and then TFN, who's doing

388
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:54,178
a four by four Rubik's Cube right now.

389
00:12:54,178 --> 00:12:55,943
(laughing)

390
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,955
And why not, right?
- Random random.

391
00:12:57,955 --> 00:12:59,656
- We've been with him all day,

392
00:12:59,656 --> 00:13:01,159
he hasn't had this, and he just walked

393
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:02,513
abour the corner with it.

394
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:03,589
So why not?

395
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:04,422
- Why not?
- Where did you pick that up?

396
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:05,329
- I'm very intrigued.

397
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:07,726
- [T] I just went and asked Coco for it.

398
00:13:07,726 --> 00:13:08,559
- Oh yeah, Coco.

399
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,392
- He knows somebody here named Coco,

400
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,112
who has a four by four Rubik's cube.

401
00:13:11,112 --> 00:13:13,360
And we want to introduce Ellie

402
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
who is here.

403
00:13:16,367 --> 00:13:18,424
(laughing)

404
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,648
- She's Ellie from Ellie and Jared.

405
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:24,610
- Yeah, do you know it was
going to be Jared and Ellie.

406
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,443
- [Rachel] Oh.

407
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:26,391
- It was going to be Jared and Ellie.

408
00:13:26,391 --> 00:13:27,224
- But you went alphabetical.

409
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,923
- [Jared] That's exactly
right, how did you know?

410
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,276
- 'Cause I feel like that's logical.

411
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:32,201
- It is logical, and we
actually did that because,

412
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,317
- [Natalie] Because I'm
a marriage counselor.

413
00:13:33,317 --> 00:13:35,022
(laughing)

414
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,583
- It kinda feels like in the bus

415
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,652
that we've all been having these talks,

416
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,153
it's like we get down and deep

417
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,517
and we're talking about all these things,

418
00:13:41,517 --> 00:13:43,134
and everyone's crying and everything,

419
00:13:43,134 --> 00:13:45,317
having a good experience

420
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,751
and it's just been a lot of fun.

421
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:48,695
And now we're making suits with Helen, so.

422
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,005
- Did you see that she made
one for President Bush?

423
00:13:51,005 --> 00:13:53,993
- For President Bush, yeah,
we were talking about that.

424
00:13:53,993 --> 00:13:55,736
- [Rachel] It is pretty cool.

425
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:56,569
- [Bonnie] I want that.

426
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:57,410
- [Salesman] This is
very important, this one.

427
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,499
- How much is that?

428
00:13:58,499 --> 00:13:59,966
- [Salesman] 180.

429
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:03,049
(singing in Chinese)

430
00:14:04,737 --> 00:14:06,278
- Your turn.

431
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:07,297
You can sing.
- I don't sing.

432
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,437
- You don't sing?

433
00:14:09,437 --> 00:14:10,475
- I don't sing too.

434
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:11,608
- Sing the same one.

435
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,269
- [Ellie] If you sing it, we'll buy it.

436
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,352
(singing in Chinese)

437
00:14:20,731 --> 00:14:22,981
(cheering and clapping)

438
00:14:22,981 --> 00:14:25,020
Everybody give it up for

439
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,853
- Lisa.

440
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:27,112
- Lisa yay.
(clapping)

441
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:28,695
- [Ellie] Lisa yay.

442
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:31,613
- Longtime singer, first
time in our audience.

443
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:35,483
♫ Smelly cats, smelly cats

444
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:38,318
- Bonnie and Joel are buying one of these.

445
00:14:38,318 --> 00:14:40,364
So it'll be worth it.

446
00:14:40,364 --> 00:14:42,403
- It depends on how much
we can bargain him down.

447
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,757
♫ Sorry no sorry

448
00:14:44,757 --> 00:14:46,424
- [Ellie] Hi Calvin.

449
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:48,697
- Hi.

450
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,476
- [Jared] Hi buddy.

451
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:51,643
- I Mommy bed.

452
00:14:52,484 --> 00:14:55,451
- [Ellie] You slept in Mommy's bed?

453
00:14:55,451 --> 00:14:56,387
- Yeah.

454
00:14:56,387 --> 00:14:58,304
- [Ellie] Oh you silly.

455
00:14:59,813 --> 00:15:02,772
- Do you know what I did on my bed?

456
00:15:02,772 --> 00:15:04,371
I slept the whole time.

457
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,874
- [Jared] Yay Jackson, you slept
the whole time in your bed?

458
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,031
- [Both] Yeah.

459
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:10,364
- Good.
- Calvin.

460
00:15:12,691 --> 00:15:13,524
- Nope.

461
00:15:15,432 --> 00:15:17,279
- [Ellie] Calvin.

462
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,374
- [Jared] Okay, I love you so much

463
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:21,460
and I want to give you a
hug through the phone, okay?

464
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,684
Family hug, ready?

465
00:15:23,684 --> 00:15:26,934
Oh hug hug hug hug, I love you so much.

466
00:15:28,438 --> 00:15:30,366
(Jared laughs)

467
00:15:30,366 --> 00:00:00,000
I love you boys.
