1
00:00:00,389 --> 00:00:02,518
- Hey guys, happy fall season.

2
00:00:02,518 --> 00:00:05,448
It is that time of year where
the pumpkins are orange,

3
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:07,030
the leaves are changing.

4
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,563
Hopefully they're not
already brown in your world.

5
00:00:09,563 --> 00:00:12,051
- And the pumpkin spice
is flying off the racks

6
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,433
like no one's business.

7
00:00:13,433 --> 00:00:15,143
- Everything that should and shouldn't

8
00:00:15,143 --> 00:00:17,624
be pumpkin spice is pumpkin spice.

9
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:20,801
And so that is what the
video is all about today.

10
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:24,683
We have some very interesting
pumpkin spice flavored things

11
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:26,404
that we are going to taste test.

12
00:00:26,404 --> 00:00:28,555
Not only us two, but with the boys.

13
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:30,085
- Yes, the boys wanted to join.

14
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:31,533
A huge thank you to Brian and Missy

15
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:33,262
for wanting us to do this video as well.

16
00:00:33,262 --> 00:00:35,045
They just did theirs and
I believe our friends

17
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,637
Colin and Katie are going
to be doing theirs soon.

18
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,187
- If you want to see their
videos, we'll have theirs

19
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:41,747
in the description down
below and in the eye cards.

20
00:00:41,747 --> 00:00:43,578
- Let's start with pumpkin eggnog.

21
00:00:43,578 --> 00:00:45,619
Our kids love chocolate
milk, so I think this will be

22
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,148
a good segue into starting
this to see their reactions.

23
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,458
(child screaming)

24
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:51,418
Kids, are you ready?
- Come on boys!

25
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:52,317
- So you're gonna taste a bunch

26
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:55,067
of things that are pumpkin spice.

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,157
- Okay.
- Daddy, Calvin.

28
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,030
- And me.
- And you.

29
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,122
- So the first thing that we're tasting

30
00:01:03,122 --> 00:01:05,621
today is pumpkin spice eggnog.

31
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:07,635
So what I want you to do boys,
- Calvin loves it.

32
00:01:07,635 --> 00:01:09,635
- I want you to take a drink,

33
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:11,655
and then tell me what you think about it.

34
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,704
Is it good, is it bad, is it funny?

35
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:16,037
Tell us what you're tasting.

36
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:20,917
- Negative, I have a
hard time drinking eggnog

37
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,512
as it is.
- Well you like it.

38
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:23,947
- The pumpkin eggnog is ucky.

39
00:01:23,947 --> 00:01:26,004
- You like it with 7 Up.
- To dilute it.

40
00:01:26,004 --> 00:01:27,308
I can't handle eggnog.

41
00:01:27,308 --> 00:01:29,037
- I like straight up eggnog.

42
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:31,125
- Do you like it Calvin?
- Calvin just downed it.

43
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,788
(laughing)

44
00:01:32,788 --> 00:01:34,747
He's like, "I want another please."

45
00:01:34,747 --> 00:01:35,611
- Do you like it?

46
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:36,444
Oh, good.

47
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:37,277
- I would like it.

48
00:01:37,277 --> 00:01:38,458
Yeah, I think I would like it.

49
00:01:38,458 --> 00:01:39,827
It's not too much pumpkin spice.

50
00:01:39,827 --> 00:01:41,408
It's just the right amount.

51
00:01:41,408 --> 00:01:42,454
- Okay, you guys keep your drinks

52
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:46,222
because you may want it for this next one.

53
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:50,389
That's Daddy's, Calvin's, and
let's do the caramel first.

54
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:56,029
This next one is a candy caramel
called pumpkin pie caramel.

55
00:01:56,877 --> 00:01:59,487
So we each have our caramels.

56
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,711
- This one right here, Calvin.

57
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:03,277
- I'm anxious to see what you think Jared.

58
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:05,237
I love caramel, so I
know I'm gonna love it.

59
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:07,201
- Calvin just said, "No,"
and ate the chocolate.

60
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,559
- Okay well, tell me what you think Cal?

61
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,913
He doesn't like it.

62
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,752
You like it?
- I like it.

63
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:15,665
I like chocolate.

64
00:02:15,665 --> 00:02:17,162
- I don't like it.

65
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:18,653
It's really, it is not good.

66
00:02:18,653 --> 00:02:19,574
- Is it spicy?

67
00:02:19,574 --> 00:02:21,283
- It's not--

68
00:02:21,283 --> 00:02:22,212
- I like the caramel.

69
00:02:22,212 --> 00:02:24,798
- I'm getting the spice
now but it's just like,

70
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:26,731
does not taste like pumpkin.

71
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:28,943
- 'Cause it's caramel jalapeno.

72
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:30,685
- Oh, you jerk!

73
00:02:30,685 --> 00:02:32,975
I was like, what the heck?

74
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:34,045
This does not taste like pumpkin at all.

75
00:02:34,045 --> 00:02:35,398
- That's why you have the red bowl.

76
00:02:35,398 --> 00:02:36,649
I didn't want the kids getting mixed up.

77
00:02:36,649 --> 00:02:37,976
(laughing)

78
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:38,809
Is it hot?

79
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:41,542
- Like the more it's
in my mouth, it's hot,

80
00:02:41,542 --> 00:02:44,651
but I was like wait a minute,
this is not pumpkin at all.

81
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:46,290
- This is the pumpkin one.

82
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,652
Don't let the kids eat that one.

83
00:02:47,652 --> 00:02:50,772
- Jalapeno, who makes a caramel jalapeno?

84
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,920
- Yeah, it's called caramel jalapeno.

85
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,164
- Jalapeno business.

86
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:57,460
- That's more chocolate.

87
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,642
- Ugh, Mom what do you think about that?

88
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:01,062
- I loved it, I loved the caramel.

89
00:03:01,062 --> 00:03:02,920
- The first one.
- Did you like the caramel?

90
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,753
- Mommy.

91
00:03:05,073 --> 00:03:06,645
- Calvin still wants more chocolate.

92
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,641
- I'm indifferent about it.

93
00:03:07,641 --> 00:03:08,942
I feel like I've got too much jalapeno

94
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,919
in my mouth to make an informed decision.

95
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:11,752
This tastes like caramel to me.

96
00:03:11,752 --> 00:03:14,878
- All right, this next taste
test is really nice chocolate,

97
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,062
so I cut them in half because
these are really nice.

98
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:22,229
So this is the limited edition
pumpkin spice chocolates.

99
00:03:23,401 --> 00:03:25,425
Lindor, is that how you say it?

100
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:27,974
Now my favorite ones of
these are the salted caramel.

101
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:28,859
That's what's amazing.

102
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:31,837
There's yours.
- I don't like salted caramel.

103
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,819
- Calvin already ate his, so he liked it.

104
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:35,830
I got jalapeno in my mouth still.

105
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,946
- I think it is so good.

106
00:03:37,946 --> 00:03:39,749
- Did you let it melt in your
mouth or did you just bite it.

107
00:03:39,749 --> 00:03:40,706
- I had just all of it.

108
00:03:40,706 --> 00:03:43,416
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

109
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,980
- Do you like it?
- It's not even strong.

110
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,189
This is probably my favorite so far.

111
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,070
It's so subtle.
- It's good.

112
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:51,160
- You almost can't even tell.

113
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,331
- Holy crap, Calvin!

114
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:55,438
You want more?
- Yeah.

115
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,081
- Okay here, let's try another

116
00:03:57,081 --> 00:03:58,639
pumpkin spice thing first, okay?

117
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,601
This kid just downed it like crazy.

118
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:01,484
I think that's his favorite.

119
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:02,981
- My cup.

120
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:04,010
- So I saw this at the store

121
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,615
and I thought this was probably
the most interesting one.

122
00:04:06,615 --> 00:04:08,246
Oh, Calvin's like, "I'm gonna take yours."

123
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:09,178
- Oh, my.

124
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:12,714
- This is boom-chik-a-pow
pumpkin spice kettle corn.

125
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:14,565
I love kettle corn.
- Love kettle corn.

126
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:15,432
- That's like my favorite popcorn ever.

127
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,942
- I don't like it, I don't like it.

128
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:19,861
- Well we're gonna have to
give it a taste test, won't we?

129
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:21,591
So let's open this up and try it.

130
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:24,402
You just don't imagine
pumpkin spice with popcorn.

131
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:26,595
- Caramel popcorn with cinnamon bears.

132
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:27,765
My mom just started making that

133
00:04:27,765 --> 00:04:30,296
quite a bit and that sounds really good.

134
00:04:30,296 --> 00:04:32,064
- Smell it, tell me what you think first.

135
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,785
- It doesn't smell good.
- No.

136
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:36,035
- I want one.
- Here we go.

137
00:04:37,387 --> 00:04:39,970
- Mm.
- Oh, you do like it now?

138
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:42,425
I have to say, no I'm not.

139
00:04:42,425 --> 00:04:43,607
- Yeah, I don't like that.

140
00:04:43,607 --> 00:04:45,696
- There's like white caramel
spread throughout it.

141
00:04:45,696 --> 00:04:47,888
- Yeah, it's like a thick,
oh it's a weird texture.

142
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,647
- I think after five bites of that

143
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,026
I would feel really gross.

144
00:04:51,026 --> 00:04:53,760
- Yeah, yeah.
- It doesn't feel refreshing.

145
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,040
(laughing)

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,201
Can popcorn be refreshing?

147
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:57,034
(Calvin babbling)

148
00:04:57,034 --> 00:04:59,471
- Kettle corn, kettle corn
is very refreshing I think.

149
00:04:59,471 --> 00:05:02,560
- Okay Jackson, tell me what this is?

150
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,315
- Pumpkin cookie.

151
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:07,235
- This is a pumpkin
cookie, and I have no doubt

152
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,023
that we are all going to love it.

153
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,934
Now wait, we have a lot of stuff to eat

154
00:05:11,934 --> 00:05:14,382
so I'm gonna break a little bit off.

155
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:17,905
If you want more after we
eat all the pumpkin stuff,

156
00:05:17,905 --> 00:05:20,299
then we can have more.
- I want to have this one.

157
00:05:20,299 --> 00:05:22,888
- But I don't want you
guys to be too sick.

158
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,459
- Pumpkin cookies are
such a classic thing.

159
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,819
I feel like since we grew up
on this, we're kind of biased.

160
00:05:27,819 --> 00:05:29,697
- Yeah.
- But it is so good.

161
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:30,780
- Really good.

162
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:34,124
- Yeah, you can't beat a
pumpkin but I'm gonna be honest,

163
00:05:34,124 --> 00:05:36,547
the store bought--
- Not as good as homemade?

164
00:05:36,547 --> 00:05:38,567
- This is not as good.

165
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,866
I wouldn't eat three of these in a row.

166
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:43,467
- I would definitely eat one.

167
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:44,747
- I don't really like the store bought.

168
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,323
I'm gonna say no.
- I like it.

169
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:47,156
I think it's good.

170
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:48,520
I would definitely eat this.

171
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,581
I am eating it.
- It has a weird aftertaste.

172
00:05:50,581 --> 00:05:52,818
- Do you boys like it?
- You like it?

173
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,651
You like it Cal, okay?

174
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,610
- Muffins!
- Muffins!

175
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:00,494
- That's right.

176
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:04,256
- These are called pumpkin
chocolate chip muffins,

177
00:06:04,256 --> 00:06:07,589
or Israeli Palestinian conflict muffins.

178
00:06:08,546 --> 00:06:12,384
- Israeli Palestinian conflict muffins.

179
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:14,063
- That's a YouTube throwback--
- That was forever ago.

180
00:06:14,063 --> 00:06:15,465
- If I've ever seen one.

181
00:06:15,465 --> 00:06:17,554
I imagine these are gonna taste
very similar to the cookies

182
00:06:17,554 --> 00:06:18,875
'cause they have chocolate chips in them,

183
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:20,326
and that's gonna be a big flavor

184
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:21,365
to take away from the pumpkin.

185
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,246
- This is breaking.
- Uh-oh.

186
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:24,152
You better eat it so quick.

187
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,273
- I'm gonna be very
honest, I really thought

188
00:06:26,273 --> 00:06:27,291
that these would be the two things

189
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,964
that are like a no-brainer
that are really good

190
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:30,881
and I do not like them.

191
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:32,708
I don't know, I think it's 'cause

192
00:06:32,708 --> 00:06:34,562
it's maybe store and not homemade.

193
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:37,885
- Maybe, homemade has a
very special taste to it.

194
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,134
- Yeah, I don't really love this.

195
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:40,896
- It's good, not great, right?

196
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:41,953
- Totes.

197
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,378
- You boys are just chowing
them down though, huh?

198
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:44,971
Do you like them?

199
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,672
- We have some pumpkin
spice Hershey kisses.

200
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:50,791
Now what are your favorite Hershey kisses?

201
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:53,882
- I like the candy cane
ones and the mint ones.

202
00:06:53,882 --> 00:06:56,009
- And I have to say I like
the caramel ones the best.

203
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:57,420
- Oh, caramel is really good.

204
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:01,202
- Is this caramel?
- This is pumpkin.

205
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,918
- I will like it.
- I do not like it.

206
00:07:02,918 --> 00:07:04,743
- It's mushy.
- Mushy, mushy.

207
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:06,640
- It's too much.
- It's too mushy.

208
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,962
- It's too spicy.

209
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:09,782
- You're just not a
pumpkin spice fan, huh?

210
00:07:09,782 --> 00:07:10,615
- I thought I was.

211
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:12,051
I really don't like it.

212
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:13,891
- I feel like a lot of
these that we've tried,

213
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,682
they just don't leave you asking for more

214
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:16,840
which is maybe a good thing.

215
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,783
- I do not like it.
- You don't?

216
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,384
- Now these little pumpkin things,

217
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:21,415
these are just like candy corn

218
00:07:21,415 --> 00:07:22,953
so I don't think they
have any different flavor,

219
00:07:22,953 --> 00:07:23,786
but they're delicious.

220
00:07:23,786 --> 00:07:25,855
- I wanna try one of these.
- Good.

221
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:27,353
You cannot go wrong with candy corn.

222
00:07:27,353 --> 00:07:28,755
Sorry, the sun's right in my eyeball.

223
00:07:28,755 --> 00:07:30,386
Do you see it, is it bad?

224
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,948
- It's just you light up my world.

225
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:33,676
- Yeah, you can't beat candy corn.

226
00:07:33,676 --> 00:07:35,306
- I do like it.

227
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,986
- You don't?
- I do.

228
00:07:36,986 --> 00:07:38,374
- Oh, good.
- Good.

229
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,118
- Do you like it, Cal?

230
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:41,876
(laughs)

231
00:07:41,876 --> 00:07:43,834
- Good, we've still got a lot more.

232
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,936
- I'll save these to pass
out for trick or treating.

233
00:07:45,936 --> 00:07:48,291
- Ellie!
- Heck yeah.

234
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,917
- Are we doing full size
candy bars this year?

235
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:51,020
Are we gonna be that family
who does full size candy bars?

236
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,619
- Nope, we're doing Hershey kisses.

237
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,420
- Oh, I guess that's the answer.

238
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,832
What's next, Momma Roo?

239
00:07:55,832 --> 00:07:58,221
- Okay, I think we should
break out another drink

240
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:01,332
'cause I really need to
drain all this stuff down.

241
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:03,733
- So here we have Stephen's gourmet

242
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,875
pumpkin spice hot chocolate.

243
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,245
Stephen's hot chocolate has some

244
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:08,078
really, really great flavors.

245
00:08:08,078 --> 00:08:10,066
- Oh, I don't like this flavor.

246
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:11,845
- You've never even tried it, silly.

247
00:08:11,845 --> 00:08:13,724
They have lots of great flavors,

248
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:16,112
so I'm hoping good things from this

249
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:19,177
because I feel like they
have a good name behind them.

250
00:08:19,177 --> 00:08:20,515
Does everyone have their hot chocolate?

251
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:21,809
- Yes!
- Tell me if you like it.

252
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,642
- Okay, give it a sip.

253
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,039
- I like it.

254
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,339
- I do like it.

255
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,370
- Um, I'm not a big fan.

256
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,203
I just love--
- I do like it.

257
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,972
- Like chocolate mint so much.

258
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,072
- I do like it.

259
00:08:36,072 --> 00:08:37,910
- I'm more of a fan of the eggnog.

260
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,470
I would do the eggnog more.

261
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,761
In the bowls in front of us,

262
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:43,069
we have three different types of cereal.

263
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,473
We have Special K pumpkin
spice crunch in this one.

264
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:51,272
we have Honey Nut Cheerios
pumpkin spice in this one,

265
00:08:51,272 --> 00:08:55,173
and we have Frosted Mini Wheats
pumpkin spice in this one.

266
00:08:55,173 --> 00:08:57,123
We're all gonna take a
taste test of each one.

267
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,663
- Let's start with
Special K pumpkin spice.

268
00:08:59,663 --> 00:09:01,196
- Okay, you take a bite Jackson.

269
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:03,681
- Okay, I'm gonna try it.

270
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:07,306
- It hardly tastes like pumpkin spice.

271
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:08,266
You like it?

272
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:09,575
It's good.

273
00:09:09,575 --> 00:09:13,407
I wouldn't buy it, I
mean it tastes just like.

274
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:15,488
It's good, it's not rich though.

275
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:17,316
- No.
- I'm gonna try this one.

276
00:09:17,316 --> 00:09:18,736
- I'm anxious about the Cheerios though

277
00:09:18,736 --> 00:09:20,558
'cause I feel like that
might have more of a kick.

278
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:21,740
- You like this one?

279
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,352
- I like this one.
- I like that one.

280
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:26,439
- Okay, Calvin and I are
trying the shredded wheat.

281
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,901
- Cheerios win for me.

282
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,631
- Frosted Mini Wheats, it's good.

283
00:09:29,631 --> 00:09:32,498
Not too weak, not too powerful.

284
00:09:32,498 --> 00:09:35,058
- Cheerios win.
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

285
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:36,504
- 'Cause it's not too strong.

286
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:39,373
- Yeah, cheerios is good.
- Not too powerful.

287
00:09:39,373 --> 00:09:40,956
- Not too powerful.

288
00:09:41,803 --> 00:09:43,631
Okay Calvin, he's grabbing the next one.

289
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:44,783
We are just about finished with

290
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:46,394
all of the foods that we have.

291
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:47,956
The second to last one we have

292
00:09:47,956 --> 00:09:50,456
is pumpkin spice Nestle chips.

293
00:09:51,445 --> 00:09:54,005
They're just like little
morsels that you have

294
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:55,407
that you put in cookies.

295
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:58,077
So we're gonna try
them, see what we think.

296
00:09:58,077 --> 00:09:59,674
One for Mommy, one for Jackson,

297
00:09:59,674 --> 00:10:01,416
one for Calvin, and one for Daddy.

298
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,955
- Oh, I don't like it.

299
00:10:02,955 --> 00:10:06,190
I don't like it, I don't like it.

300
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:08,251
- It would probably be
better in a cookie, cooked.

301
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,013
- I was just gonna say, are
these meant for cooking?

302
00:10:10,013 --> 00:10:11,763
- Yeah.
- Did I make a mistake?

303
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:12,596
- That's gross.

304
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:13,982
(coughs)

305
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:16,397
That's gross.
- I don't like it.

306
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,633
(babbling)

307
00:10:18,633 --> 00:10:20,377
- All right, we have the best for last.

308
00:10:20,377 --> 00:10:23,018
Who does not love a good Oreo?

309
00:10:23,018 --> 00:10:24,105
- Everyone in America loves Oreos.

310
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:26,445
- Everyone in America loves Oreos.

311
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:28,952
Oreo has come out with a
lot of interesting flavors

312
00:10:28,952 --> 00:10:31,082
the last few years.
- Mm-hmm (affirmative).

313
00:10:31,082 --> 00:10:33,171
- Some have not been the best.

314
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:35,001
- Yeah, but some of them really do.

315
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,238
I think Oreo thins are the best.

316
00:10:36,238 --> 00:10:38,089
- Yes, Oreo thins are the best.

317
00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:39,987
- Here you go.

318
00:10:39,987 --> 00:10:40,987
Okay, ready?

319
00:10:44,591 --> 00:10:46,727
- I'm gonna try it.

320
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:48,977
- It tastes the exact same.

321
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:53,423
- Did they just trick everyone in America?

322
00:10:53,423 --> 00:10:54,703
- Is this a trick?

323
00:10:54,703 --> 00:10:56,043
Oreo, did you just trick us?

324
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,726
- It tastes like a flippin' Oreo.

325
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,154
- Halloween Oreo, right?

326
00:11:00,154 --> 00:11:01,063
You'd think it would
be a different flavor.

327
00:11:01,063 --> 00:11:02,093
- Yep, it's the same.

328
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:02,926
They just color it orange.

329
00:11:02,926 --> 00:11:06,535
- Oh my gosh, orange
color cream, same taste.

330
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,631
I'm an idiot!
- No, they are.

331
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:12,509
- Or they're smart.
- Bad advertising.

332
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,840
That was clickbait.

333
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,007
Oreo, you just clickbaited me, mother!

334
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:20,381
- I like it.
- You do?

335
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:22,670
- At least it still tastes good, right?

336
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,734
- Wouldn't it have been
funny if I was like,

337
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:25,302
"Oh, this is gross."

338
00:11:25,302 --> 00:11:27,362
(Calvin babbling)

339
00:11:27,362 --> 00:11:28,195
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

340
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,437
- Oh, that was funny.

341
00:11:29,437 --> 00:11:31,960
Best for last, Oreos you can't beat.

342
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,717
- So we tried all of these
pumpkin spice things.

343
00:11:33,717 --> 00:11:36,299
What was your favorite and
what was your least favorite?

344
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:38,397
- The Lindor chocolates were my favorite.

345
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,979
My least favorite was the Hershey kisses.

346
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:40,812
Boo!

347
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:42,941
- The Hershey kisses or the Nestle things?

348
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:44,359
- No, the Hershey kisses.

349
00:11:44,359 --> 00:11:46,794
- Okay, my favorite was the eggnog

the Nestle chocolate chip.

351

352
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:54,337

flavors have you guys seen?

359
00:12:09,326 --> 00:12:10,780
The weirdest ones, I want to know.

360
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,729
Let us know in the comments
section down below.

361
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:15,717
- Jared and I feel fortunate
that we could sit down

362
00:12:15,717 --> 00:12:17,218
and do this fun video for you,

363
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,481
that we could go out and buy a bunch

364
00:12:18,481 --> 00:12:22,129
of fun pumpkin spice flavored
items and test them out.

365
00:12:22,129 --> 00:12:25,119
Right now is especially
the season of giving,

366
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,747
and we wanted to donate to a food bank.

367
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,135
- So Ellie and I are gonna
contact our local food bank

368
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:31,986
and we're gonna make sure

369
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,794
that we give a donation back to them.

370
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,846
- Thank you guys so much
for watching our vlog today

371
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,306
and we'll see you tomorrow.

372
00:12:37,306 --> 00:12:39,375

373
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,077
(imitating explosions)

374
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:43,428
- Pumpkin to the face!

375
00:12:43,428 --> 00:00:00,000
(glass shattering)
