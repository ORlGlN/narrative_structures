1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:03,546
- He goes a tiny bit,
but he gets so excited,

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,812
and then he stops.

3
00:00:04,812 --> 00:00:05,645
- Hi.

4
00:00:05,645 --> 00:00:08,173
- [Ellie] Snowstorm is coming in!

5
00:00:08,173 --> 00:00:10,505
- This is such good packing snow!

6
00:00:10,505 --> 00:00:12,201
Soon as we got home from
church, we knew exactly what

7
00:00:12,201 --> 00:00:13,245
we were gonna do.

8
00:00:13,245 --> 00:00:15,649
We were gonna get a lot of stuff done.

9
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,067
- Scratch that.

10
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:17,900
- Woohoo!

11
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:20,628
- Nice!

12
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:25,431
We got Zuma!

13
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:26,609
- Yeah.

14
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,515
- We just opened up another
space for the advent calendar,

15
00:00:30,515 --> 00:00:31,925
and the kids got Chase.

16
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:33,857
We missed a day, so they got to open two.

17
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:34,690
- [Jackson] We got Chase.

18
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,868
- Don't open that one yet.

19
00:00:35,868 --> 00:00:39,509
You did, and, tonight,
we are going to read.

20
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:40,672
We are gonna start this.

21
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:43,872
I saw this at the bookstore the other day.

22
00:00:43,872 --> 00:00:46,077
It's a little book, and
you read it every night,

23
00:00:46,077 --> 00:00:47,713
and it comes with a little lamb,

24
00:00:47,713 --> 00:00:50,080
and every night you read some scripture,

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,455
so it has scriptures or things you can do,

26
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:54,298
and that's what we're gonna start tonight

27
00:00:54,298 --> 00:00:58,282
is we're gonna read that,
which I'm very excited about.

28
00:00:58,282 --> 00:01:02,449
We also got a really My First
Christmas Story for the kids,

29
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:07,059
and it talks all about Jesus's story.

30
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:10,496
That's what we're gonna
read tonight as well.

31
00:01:10,496 --> 00:01:11,601
Did you have fun with your cousins?

32
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,434
- Yeah.

33
00:01:12,434 --> 00:01:14,082
- I had so much fun.

34
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:16,389
What's fun is when you do something

35
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:17,959
that you totally didn't plan.

36
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:19,839
Julie didn't plan on staying two nights,

37
00:01:19,839 --> 00:01:21,921
and then it just happened to be the case,

38
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:24,029
and it was really fun,

39
00:01:24,029 --> 00:01:27,211
and something special
that I saw this morning

40
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:30,070
when I was making the bed
was that little dog up there.

41
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:30,903
I made the bed.

42
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:33,682
I was like, "Oh, thanks
Calvin for your little gift".

43
00:01:33,682 --> 00:01:34,968
- No, wawa!

44
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:36,047
- We need water.

45
00:01:36,047 --> 00:01:38,096
- [Ellie] Oh, you need
the water to play this.

46
00:01:38,096 --> 00:01:40,401
- [Jackson] No, no Zuma loves water.

47
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:41,811
- [Ellie] K, there you go.

48
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,561
- We need to dive in.

49
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:46,742
Come on, dive.

50
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,176
- Hi.

51
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,077
(mocks snoring)

52
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:01,596
- [Jackson] Calvin, come here.

53
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:02,513
- Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,275
(shouting)

55
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,853
- [Ellie] Where's your snack?

56
00:02:08,853 --> 00:02:09,900
- Somewhere.

57
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,483
- [Ellie] Show me. Where is it?

58
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:15,056
Where is it?

59
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:16,360
(baby talking)
Is it up there?

60
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,193
- [Calvin] Yeah.

61
00:02:17,193 --> 00:02:20,026
- K, what snack are you gonna get?

62
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:23,392
I feel it.

63
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:25,251
I can feel it.

64
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:27,726
K, oh, usually I give you three.

65
00:02:27,726 --> 00:02:30,751
You got four little baby M&Ms.

66
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:31,584
Good job.

67
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:34,080
Good job.

68
00:02:35,214 --> 00:02:39,035
K, it is sinking in today on day three.

69
00:02:39,035 --> 00:02:42,053
Yesterday wasn't as
consistent, because we had lots

70
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:46,220
of family in town, but he is
doing well with the potty.

71
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:49,248
Like I said, today is sinking in.

72
00:02:49,248 --> 00:02:52,129
He loves to go, and he's
excited to sit on the potty,

73
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,641
and he goes a tiny bit,
but he gets so excited,

74
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:57,977
and then he stops.

75
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:00,892
He goes potty lots of times
but just a little bit,

76
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,597
because then he stops,
'cause he's excited.

77
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:08,283
Hopefully, by today really
just focusing on the bathroom

78
00:03:08,283 --> 00:03:11,087
with me and him, he will get it down,

79
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:13,376
and maybe even tomorrow he'll go lots more

80
00:03:13,376 --> 00:03:15,779
instead of little bits, huh?

81
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,041
- No pee.

82
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,427
- [Ellie] No pee? (laughs)

83
00:03:18,427 --> 00:03:20,044
- No pee!

84
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:22,263
- [Ellie] Did you go pee all gone?

85
00:03:22,263 --> 00:03:23,096
- Yeah.

86
00:03:23,096 --> 00:03:23,929
- [Ellie] Yeah.

87
00:03:23,929 --> 00:03:25,175
- No pee.

88
00:03:25,175 --> 00:03:27,181
- [Ellie] Well, good
job. I'm proud of you.

89
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:28,014
- Yeah.

90
00:03:28,014 --> 00:03:31,176
(toilet flushing)

91
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:32,093
- Good job.

92
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,391
Guys, it is starting.

93
00:03:35,391 --> 00:03:39,013
This is an official, official snowstorm.

94
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:40,649
It's coming in!

95
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:44,287
Look at the snow, and daddy
just walked through the door.

96
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,120
Do you wanna tell him?

97
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,424
- Cal, it's snowing!

98
00:03:46,424 --> 00:03:47,896
- It's snowing outside!

99
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:48,975
- [Ellie] Hi.

100
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:49,808
- Look at it!

101
00:03:49,808 --> 00:03:50,667
- [Ellie] I know.

102
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,241
- Oh my gosh, I'm slipping
all over the place.

103
00:03:53,241 --> 00:03:54,424
- I wanna go outside.

104
00:03:54,424 --> 00:03:55,926
- [Ellie] Calvin, tell daddy what you did.

105
00:03:55,926 --> 00:03:58,858
Calvin did not have one accident.

106
00:03:58,858 --> 00:03:59,820
- That's amazing!

107
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,090
- While Jared was gone.

108
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,161
It's been, like, five hours, all day.

109
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,341
He had an accident this morning,

110
00:04:04,341 --> 00:04:06,576
and then he hasn't had
one since, and, just now,

111
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:08,009
like right when you walked in the door,

112
00:04:08,009 --> 00:04:11,017
he started a little tiny
bit in his underwear,

113
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,271
and I said, "Let's hurry, let's hurry,"

114
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:14,580
and we ran to the bathroom,
and he peed in the toilet.

115
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,189
- Good job, my little buddy, good job.

116
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:20,608
I just gave him a big hug,
and he's like, "Oh, wet,"

117
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,252
'cause of the snow.

118
00:04:22,252 --> 00:04:23,085
Look at it.

119
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:24,548
- [Ellie] Did you guys
have a good day at church?

120
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:25,381
- [Jared] Yes.

121
00:04:25,381 --> 00:04:27,222
- [Ellie] Was it fun?

122
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:29,257
- I wanna go outside.

123
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:30,735
- I do too. Look at it.

124
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:31,837
Here we go.

125
00:04:31,837 --> 00:04:33,017
Are you excited?

126
00:04:33,017 --> 00:04:34,173
Here we go.

127
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,603
Are you excited?

128
00:04:35,603 --> 00:04:38,816
We're gonna go play in the snow, yeah.

129
00:04:38,816 --> 00:04:41,399
(upbeat music)

130
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:45,712
(mumbles)

131
00:04:45,712 --> 00:04:48,295
(upbeat music)

132
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:57,741
- Ready to go outside?

133
00:04:57,741 --> 00:04:59,486
- [Jackson] Yeah.

134
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:02,399
(upbeat music)

135
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,641
- Yeah, give me high five.

136
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,224
(upbeat music)

137
00:05:16,103 --> 00:05:17,213
(laughs)

138
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:20,194
This is such good packing snow!

139
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,777
(upbeat music)

140
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:26,120
- [Ellie] Let's see how fast you go.

141
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,429
(laughs)

142
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,262
K, go.

143
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:30,345
- [Jared] Ready, set, go!

144
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,572
(laughs)

145
00:05:33,572 --> 00:05:35,444
(distant shouting)

146
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:36,694
Ready, set, go!

147
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:39,547
(laughs)

148
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,937
- [Jackson] I'm gonna do it again.

149
00:05:40,937 --> 00:05:41,770
- [Jared] Yeah.

150
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,145
- [Ellie] It is December, baby.

151
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,480
- I love it, I love it.

152
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,882
(laughs)

153
00:05:46,882 --> 00:05:47,715
- [Ellie] You're gonna learn real quick

154
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,105
to keep those gloves on, mister.

155
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:51,101
- [Jared] Yeah, don't take 'em off.

156
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,671
- [Ellie] Calvin has gone
through two pair of snow gloves.

157
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,106
- Woohoo!

158
00:05:55,106 --> 00:05:57,534
(laughs)

159
00:05:57,534 --> 00:05:58,952
- [Ellie] It's fast, huh?

160
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:00,172
- Yeah, it's fast.

161
00:06:00,172 --> 00:06:01,910
- I need to run inside and
grab some hot chocolate.

162
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,743
The one time I really
want to have a Razor,

163
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:10,176
but a covered Razor, is
so that the kids and Jared

164
00:06:10,176 --> 00:06:14,233
and I can drive to Bonnie's,
like just all pile in,

165
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,937
'cause it's street approved,
and she's not very far

166
00:06:16,937 --> 00:06:18,968
down the road, so we won't
take a four-wheeler right now,

167
00:06:18,968 --> 00:06:21,013
'cause it's cold.

168
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:23,283
Maybe we will take a four-wheeler.

169
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,969
It's not that cold.

170
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,718
Jared, maybe we should
take the four-wheeler.

171
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:27,770
- [Jared] That's a great idea!

172
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,371
(laughs)

173
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:31,870
- Okay, we might take the
four-wheeler and go to Bonnie's,

174
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,654
but, some time in the future,
it would be really fun

175
00:06:34,654 --> 00:06:37,249
to get a covered Razor
for really freezing days

176
00:06:37,249 --> 00:06:39,094
where we wanna go back and forth

177
00:06:39,094 --> 00:06:41,233
and go play in her snow and
then them come over here.

178
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,265
That would be fun.

179
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:43,591
Let's go get some hot chocolate.

180
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:45,418
- We went to Bonnie's,
and we built a snowman!

181
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,251
Woo!

182
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,310
Ow, you guys are eating his buttons.

183
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,271
(laughs)

184
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:52,698
Are you done in the toilet?

185
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:55,407
- All right, it just kinda--

186
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:58,099
- [Jared] Just kinda happened, didn't it?

187
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,349
This is so fun.

188
00:07:00,773 --> 00:07:02,642
Are you guys having a blast?

189
00:07:02,642 --> 00:07:03,475
- [Olivia] Yeah.

190
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:04,308
(laughs)

191
00:07:04,308 --> 00:07:05,141
- I'm eating his eye.

192
00:07:05,141 --> 00:07:06,272
- They're breaking the snowman.

193
00:07:06,272 --> 00:07:07,731
- K, you guys can't have any fun

194
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:09,788
if you're breaking the snowman.

195
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:12,185
No fun until the pictures
are done, k? Jeepers.

196
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:13,920
- [Ellie] Cal, he has my gloves off again.

197
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,503
(upbeat music)

198
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:21,661
- Okay, that was the first
real snow of the season.

199
00:07:21,661 --> 00:07:23,803
Jackson, remember the
other day when it snowed

200
00:07:23,803 --> 00:07:27,862
just a little bit, and you
went outside and played?

201
00:07:27,862 --> 00:07:29,593
This is a real snow.

202
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,961
Did you guys have so much fun?

203
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,837
- It was a blast.

204
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:36,689
- Yes, it was, and I think
the best part about it:

205
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,220
we had a plan for the day.

206
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,901
We had our whole day planned out.

207
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:41,845
As soon as we got home from
church, we knew exactly what

208
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:42,736
we were gonna do.

209
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:45,077
We were gonna get a lot of stuff done.

210
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:46,538
- Scratch that.

211
00:07:46,538 --> 00:07:47,569
- Scratch that.

212
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,402
It snowed.

213
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,367
That means we're gonna party in the snow.

214
00:07:50,367 --> 00:07:51,742
We went over to Bonnie and Joel's,

215
00:07:51,742 --> 00:07:53,516
and we played in the
snow and made a snowman.

216
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:55,038
(baby talking)

217
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:56,010
- And then we came home.

218
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,692
- And I ate the snow buttons.

219
00:07:58,692 --> 00:08:00,996
- [Jared] Yes, you did,
'cause they were what?

220
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:01,894
- Oreos.

221
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:02,727
- [Jared] That's right.

222
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,432
- They're so yummy.

223
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:05,958
Yummy, yummy.

224
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:08,071
(laughs)

225
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,071
- I got you.

226
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,182
Don't run from me.

227
00:08:12,182 --> 00:08:14,388
(laughs)

228
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:18,569
I literally said, "Jackson,
I'm gonna get Calvin

229
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,254
"to bed, and I need you
to be a good boy and play,

230
00:08:21,254 --> 00:08:22,768
"and, when I'm done putting him to bed,

231
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,052
"I'll put you to bed," and you, stinker,

232
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:26,507
slid down the hall stairs and ran.

233
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:27,552
(laughs)

234
00:08:27,552 --> 00:08:28,875
- [Jared] He knows what's up.

235
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,757
- [Ellie] Jackson, you hear me?

236
00:08:30,757 --> 00:08:34,051
Please play good while
I get him to bed, okay?

237
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:37,299
Look, daddy's gonna work, and
I want you to be good, okay?

238
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:38,615
- Okay.

239
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:40,116
- [Jared] Bye bye!

240
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:44,669
- Sometimes we switch off
putting the kids to bed,

241
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,282
and sometimes daddy has a lot of work.

242
00:08:48,282 --> 00:08:51,041
- Yep, got a lot of work this weekend,

243
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,345
and I'm getting a head start on it.

244
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:54,348
Goodnight, Calvin. I love you.

245
00:08:54,348 --> 00:08:55,181
I'm proud of you for peeing in the toilet.

246
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:56,280
- [Calvin] Goodnight.

247
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,431
- [Jackson] Goodnight, goodnight.

248
00:08:58,431 --> 00:08:59,886
- [Jared] Goodnight.

249
00:08:59,886 --> 00:00:00,000
- Night.
