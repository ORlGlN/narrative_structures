1
00:00:00,239 --> 00:00:02,739
(light music)

2
00:00:06,156 --> 00:00:08,156
- [Jared] Good morning.

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:10,513
- Good morning.

4
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:12,143
- [Jared] Merry Christmas.

5
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:14,165
- Merry Christmas.

6
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:16,806
- Having the kids sleep
in their sleeping bags

7
00:00:16,806 --> 00:00:19,569
in our room on the floor, I had no idea

8
00:00:19,569 --> 00:00:22,901
if it would even go well,
but usually every night,

9
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:26,010
one of them wakes up
and ends up in our room

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,046
and in our bed.

11
00:00:27,046 --> 00:00:29,713
This is the first time in months

12
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,686
that Calvin has not woken up one time

13
00:00:34,686 --> 00:00:37,185
and has stayed in his own bed.

14
00:00:37,185 --> 00:00:38,729
Why?

15
00:00:38,729 --> 00:00:40,151
Why?

16
00:00:40,151 --> 00:00:41,370
I mean, months, guys.

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:42,406
Months.

18
00:00:42,406 --> 00:00:44,377
Is it because he was in
our room the whole time

19
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,877
and he liked the temperature?

20
00:00:48,004 --> 00:00:49,093
I don't know.

21
00:00:49,093 --> 00:00:50,292
Merry Christmas!

22
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:51,491
- Merry Christmas.

23
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,380
- Are you excited?

24
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:57,130
We'll just slowly talk
a little louder, okay?

25
00:00:59,049 --> 00:01:01,049
- Come, we're gonna see.

26
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:03,210
Santa came!

27
00:01:04,821 --> 00:01:06,203
- Okay?

28
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:08,036
Let's let him wake up.

29
00:01:10,522 --> 00:01:12,208
- Merry Christmas.

30
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,375
Should we go see if Santa Clause came?

31
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:17,562
- Let's go see!

32
00:01:19,726 --> 00:01:20,559
What?

33
00:01:22,021 --> 00:01:22,854
What?

34
00:01:24,622 --> 00:01:25,539
It's Santa!

35
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:27,385
He came!

36
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,550
- [Ellie] It looks awesome!

37
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,033
- What the?

38
00:01:33,033 --> 00:01:34,533
My favorite thing!

39
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:37,541
- [jared] What is it?

40
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:39,132
- A marble runner.

41
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,528
- [Jared] A marble runner?

42
00:01:40,528 --> 00:01:41,361
- Yeah!

43
00:01:42,726 --> 00:01:45,022
- Should we open the bag
and try them on real quick?

44
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:45,855
- Yeah!

45
00:01:51,088 --> 00:01:54,014
- Oh that's huge, it's as tall as you!

46
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,538
- It is as tall as you!

47
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:58,799
- [Jared] Okay, drop it in there.

48
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,299
- [Ellie] Jackson!

49
00:02:01,665 --> 00:02:04,367
- [Jared] Round and
round and round it goes.

50
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,950
Will it stop, we'll never know!

51
00:02:08,186 --> 00:02:09,936
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

52
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:13,510
Do you want to go put a couple in?

53
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,760
- [Jared] That was so cool!

54
00:02:19,301 --> 00:02:21,129
Merry Christmas, Mom!

55
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:23,343
- Merry Christmas!

56
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:24,400
- [Jared] Do you love it?

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,781
- The kids slept in their own bed!

58
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:26,736
- [Jared] Merry Christmas!

59
00:02:26,736 --> 00:02:28,272
- Merry Christmas!

60
00:02:28,272 --> 00:02:30,522
(laughing)

61
00:02:32,071 --> 00:02:34,904
(marbles falling)

62
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:42,118
- [Jared] That's so cool.

63
00:02:43,327 --> 00:02:44,708
(squealing)

64
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,704
- It's yours!

65
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:46,557
- [Jared] Go sit on the fireplace,

66
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,305
and you can open them together.

67
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:51,880
- How did he get all
of these presents here?

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,734
- [Jared] I don't know.

69
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,034
He's pretty magical.

70
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:55,456
- Ho, ho.

71
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,635
- [Jared] Ho ho?

72
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,215
- [Ellie] Did ho ho
come and give you a box?

73
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:00,251
- Yeah!

74
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,877
- [Jared] He's just so
mesmerized by everything

75
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,563
he doesn't even want to open one.

76
00:03:03,563 --> 00:03:05,813
(laughing)

77
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:09,181
Oh, what is it?

78
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:13,302
(paper rustling)

79
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:20,589
- It's a Jack in the Box!

80
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:22,506
That was what I wanted!

81
00:03:24,429 --> 00:03:26,522
- [Jared] Is it a Jack in the Box?

82
00:03:26,522 --> 00:03:28,025
- [Ellie] It is heavy.

83
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:30,748
It looks like it says marbles.

84
00:03:30,748 --> 00:03:33,773
- [Jared] Are there
marbles on the pictures?

85
00:03:33,773 --> 00:03:37,012
Maybe there's tons of marbles in there.

86
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:38,799
- I put some in that.

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,299
- [Jared] That's a great idea.

88
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,503
- What?

89
00:03:46,783 --> 00:03:48,165
What is it?

90
00:03:48,165 --> 00:03:50,766
(laughing)

91
00:03:50,766 --> 00:03:52,493
You want me to open the box?

92
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:53,326
- No.

93
00:03:54,585 --> 00:03:57,572
(gasping)

94
00:03:57,572 --> 00:03:58,588
Boat.

95
00:03:58,588 --> 00:04:00,680
- [Jared] It's a boat!

96
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,013
(squealing)

97
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,329
- Did you get a boat?

98
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,162
- Yeah!

99
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:10,236
Yeah!

100
00:04:10,236 --> 00:04:12,275
- Do you want me to open it?

101
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:15,025
(paper rustling)

102
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,512
- Maybe it's a Jack in the Box.

103
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:20,686
- [Jared] Maybe it's a Jack in the Box.

104
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,820
- It is a Jack in the Box!

105
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,263
- [Jared] Whoa!

106
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,315
- [Ellie] That's what you wanted!

107
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,982
(music chiming)

108
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:34,032
(gasping)

109
00:04:34,032 --> 00:04:35,472
- A clown.

110
00:04:35,472 --> 00:04:37,463
(laughing)

111
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:40,388
(music chiming)

112
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:43,273
(laughing)

113
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:45,102
- Every time!

114
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:46,484
Want to open that one?

115
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:47,357
- Yeah.

116
00:04:47,357 --> 00:04:48,861
- Okay, sit down.

117
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:49,694
- A baby!

118
00:04:51,238 --> 00:04:53,006
- What should we name this baby?

119
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:53,981
- Ty-Ty.

120
00:04:53,981 --> 00:04:55,053
- Ty-Ty?

121
00:04:55,053 --> 00:04:56,584
- Yeah, Ty-Ty.

122
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:59,042
(laughing)

123
00:04:59,042 --> 00:04:59,875
- Ty-Ty.

124
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:04,711
Let's get your baby out.

125
00:05:04,711 --> 00:05:08,047
It's gonna help you get ready for brother.

126
00:05:08,047 --> 00:05:09,964
- I'm gonna open this one.

127
00:05:09,964 --> 00:05:11,631
- Is that your baby?

128
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:16,649
Look, this is gonna help you
get ready for baby brother.

129
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,071
- Yeah!

130
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,082
- Are you so excited?

131
00:05:20,082 --> 00:05:23,557
- So, this is gonna help you
learn how to help the baby,

132
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:27,724
keep the baby safe, feed the
baby, change the baby's diaper!

133
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:32,009
This is all gonna be so helpful

134
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,020
when Mommy has our new baby.
- I want to open this one.

135
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,646
I'm gonna open this one.
- It's his bed.

136
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:37,637
- I'm gonna open this one.

137
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,470
- Okay.

138
00:05:42,014 --> 00:05:43,012
- Okay.

139
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:45,105
(laughing)

140
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:48,051
- Let's let Daddy open a present, okay?

141
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:49,432
- Okay, I'm excited.

142
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,566
- Okay, let me get Daddy his present.

143
00:05:51,566 --> 00:05:53,618
Does Daddy have a box?

144
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:56,482
I think I know what
one I want him to open.

145
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,232
(paper rustling)

146
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:01,826
- Use your knife, Dad!

147
00:06:01,826 --> 00:06:03,167
- Okay.

148
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,417
(laughing)

149
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:08,713
Look at this!

150
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:09,811
- I know you want a hat.

151
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:10,826
- Yeah, I do!

152
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:11,985
This is perfect.

153
00:06:11,985 --> 00:06:14,707
This is one of the one
things that I actually

154
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,333
wanted.
- Needed.

155
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,083
- And, this is... No!

156
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:23,119
No way!

157
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:27,792
Oh my gosh, boys, look at this.

158
00:06:27,792 --> 00:06:31,022
These are all new Carhartt coats.

159
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:32,641
- You can wear yours,

160
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,364
but the boys can all
wear theirs' next year.

161
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,364
This is a six month one.

162
00:06:38,452 --> 00:06:39,671
- Oh my goodness.

163
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,764
- Isn't that so cute?

164
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:43,816
You guys will all be matching.

165
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:45,949
(Jackson yelling)

166
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:46,985
- Rocks?

167
00:06:46,985 --> 00:06:47,818
- Yeah!

168
00:06:48,692 --> 00:06:49,647
- That's awesome!

169
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,480
(Jackson yelling)

170
00:06:53,502 --> 00:06:55,042
- Do you like rocks?

171
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:57,135
- Yeah, I love these rocks.

172
00:06:57,135 --> 00:06:58,903
- Wait, wait.

173
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:02,403
This says it's a rock tumbler refill pack,

174
00:07:03,393 --> 00:07:05,689
so I think there must be
something that goes with it.

175
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:08,391
Give Mommy the small one,
she can start with that one.

176
00:07:08,391 --> 00:07:09,468
- I like small things.

177
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:11,012
Is it a pocket knife?

178
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:11,845
- No.

179
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:15,153
- That's the size.

180
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:16,985
- Yeah.

181
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:18,875
- What?

182
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:22,166
Are those the lipsticks?

183
00:07:22,166 --> 00:07:24,543
(laughing)

184
00:07:24,543 --> 00:07:26,108
You are the best.

185
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:28,200
- They're not just any old lipstick.

186
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,309
Those are NARS Power Matte, girl!

187
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:34,032
- Oh my gosh, you are so cute.

188
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,779
- And, they're red just like you wanted.

189
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:36,653
- Both?

190
00:07:36,653 --> 00:07:38,018
- They're two different reds.

191
00:07:38,018 --> 00:07:40,268
- Jared, those are so cute!

192
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,050
- Oh my gosh.

193
00:07:45,238 --> 00:07:47,270
- What is that?

194
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,834
- What is this?

195
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:51,334
- That is called a Lite-Brite.

196
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:57,022
- We've got a Lite-Brite, a
Fischer Price tape recorder.

197
00:07:57,022 --> 00:07:58,708
What year is it?

198
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,509
(laughing)

199
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:01,759
- What the heck?

200
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,092
- What the heck?

201
00:08:03,989 --> 00:08:05,906
- It is a rock machine!

202
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:11,534
- [Ellie] Good, let's open it up!

203
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:16,146
- Rock machine, rock machine,
rock, rock, rock machine.

204
00:08:16,146 --> 00:08:17,832
Let's open this up!

205
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:19,336
- [Ellie] Wow.

206
00:08:19,336 --> 00:08:22,444
See, they're all rough
before and they get shiny

207
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:23,944
after a long time!

208
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,341
- I want to open it up.

209
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,657
- [Jared] Open your present.

210
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:30,774
- I'm not gonna act shocked

211
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,607
because I think I know what it is.

212
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,703
- It's an instant pot!

213
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:40,933
- [Jared] Oh, your
reaction was so genuine.

214
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:41,933
- I love it.

215
00:08:43,485 --> 00:08:44,785
Thank you, Jared.

216
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:45,983
- [Jared] You're so welcome.

217
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,604
- I can't wait to make my boiled
eggs in one minute's time.

218
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,534
- [Jared] This is the trendiest thing

219
00:08:50,534 --> 00:08:53,765
I've ever bought for anyone ever.

220
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:54,903
- I love it.

221
00:08:54,903 --> 00:08:55,979
(Jackson screaming)

222
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,402
It's a ship?
- What?

223
00:08:57,402 --> 00:08:58,819
- Like real life.

224
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:05,032
We went on last year.

225
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:06,393
- Like where we went last year?

226
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:08,506
- [Jared] Oh my goodness, gracious.

227
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,665
- This is so cool.

228
00:09:09,665 --> 00:09:10,802
- [Jared] That is so cool.

229
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:12,062
- Porridge, yogurt?

230
00:09:12,062 --> 00:09:14,094
- [Jared] Yeah, do you
want to make some yogurt?

231
00:09:14,094 --> 00:09:15,049
Done.

232
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:16,613
Instant Pot.

233
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:18,665
- This I'm very excited for.

234
00:09:18,665 --> 00:09:20,758
- [Jared] Look at all the
things you can make with it.

235
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:21,632
- Thank you.

236
00:09:21,632 --> 00:09:22,851
- [Jared] You're so welcome.

237
00:09:22,851 --> 00:09:24,252
I'm really excited about that.

238
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:25,167
- I am too.

239
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:26,284
- [Jared] I'm gonna throw
some things in there,

240
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:27,442
cook 'em up real quick.

241
00:09:27,442 --> 00:09:28,516
Here you go, buddy.

242
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:29,781
- Look at this!

243
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,260
- [Jared] Do you want
me to help you open it?

244
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,134
Oh, thanks.

245
00:09:33,134 --> 00:09:34,007
Oh, what'd you?

246
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:34,881
Oh, my goodness.

247
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:35,836
It's Jack Skellington.

248
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,543
This is Halloween.

249
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:40,570
(jazzy music)

250
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,737
- [Ellie] Wow.

251
00:09:42,622 --> 00:09:45,365
That looks like the tray I want.

252
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:46,828
Oranges.

253
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:48,859
- [Jackson] Candy cane!

254
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:52,513
- [Ellie] Should we get
some hot cocoa going?

255
00:09:52,513 --> 00:09:55,088
- I'm gonna use this one.

256
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,388
- [Ellie] Okay.

257
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:59,619
- This is Halloween, this is Halloween.

258
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:02,119
(jazzy music)

259
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:04,759
- Okay, there you go.

260
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,649
Jacks, will you open that end?

261
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:08,732
Like this, open this end.

262
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:15,821
- We can race cars on this carpet!

263
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,853
- What?

264
00:10:21,065 --> 00:10:23,930
- [Jared] Oh my goodness gracious.

265
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,779
Look at that!

266
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,039
- [Ellie] Should we open it up?

267
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,542
- [Jared] Let's see if
we can wheel it out.

268
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:29,761
Look guys.

269
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:33,113
There's a church and a
hospital and a fire department

270
00:10:33,113 --> 00:10:35,856
and a police station and
a park and an airport

271
00:10:35,856 --> 00:10:39,920
and a carwash facility and a post office.

272
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,383
Oh my goodness.

273
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:42,947
Oh, and another church.

274
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:44,613
Oh, that must be a school.

275
00:10:44,613 --> 00:10:46,706
Let's get our roadster racers,

276
00:10:46,706 --> 00:10:49,103
and we'll race around this city.

277
00:10:49,103 --> 00:10:50,993
Make sure to stay on the road.

278
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:52,781
We've got to practice safe driving.

279
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,422
(humming)

280
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,738
- We could go get all of our
Hot Wheels from downstairs.

281
00:10:57,738 --> 00:10:58,795
- [Jared] Yeah, we could.

282
00:10:58,795 --> 00:11:01,628
That would be a crazy traffic jam.

283
00:11:05,028 --> 00:11:07,755
(laughing)

284
00:11:07,755 --> 00:11:08,838
Crash, oh no!

285
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:15,394
That one is from Missy, and
after watching Cullen's vlog

286
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,893
I believe that this one is from Bryan

287
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:20,433
with the duct tape, so I may need to

288
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,079
get some power tools, Ellie.

289
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,460
I saw how Cullen did it.

290
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,207
- It's a little intense?

291
00:11:25,207 --> 00:11:26,040
- Yeah.

292
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,571
- Oh, is it a robe?

293
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:29,488
Oh my gosh.

294
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,113
That was so sweet of her.

295
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:35,958
- Look at that!

296
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,010
- That's such a fun robe.

297
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,778
- [Jared] All right, we've got two left

298
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:42,663
before this crazy one, Bryan!

299
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:46,442
So, I think Ellie you
should open up this one.

300
00:11:46,442 --> 00:11:49,489
This one is probably 150 pounds,

301
00:11:49,489 --> 00:11:51,927
so I need you to come sit over here,

302
00:11:51,927 --> 00:11:54,853
and then I'll put it right here for you.

303
00:11:54,853 --> 00:11:56,885
- I love me some robe.

304
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,592
That is beautiful.

305
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,009
Look how cozy that is.

306
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:02,127
- That looks great.

307
00:12:02,127 --> 00:12:03,346
- Thanks, Missy!

308
00:12:03,346 --> 00:12:04,929
- Oh, look at that!

309
00:12:05,987 --> 00:12:07,877
This is all for my grilling.

310
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:08,811
- Camping.

311
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:10,985
- Camping with the Dutch oven.

312
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:11,818
Awesome.

313
00:12:12,692 --> 00:12:14,581
- I want a Dutch coven.

314
00:12:14,581 --> 00:12:17,831
- We didn't ask for anything, you know.

315
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,502
(gasping)

316
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:25,791
I forgot I did ask for something.

317
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,811
I forgot that I asked for it.

318
00:12:27,811 --> 00:12:29,659
- [Jared] What is it?

319
00:12:29,659 --> 00:12:30,492
- Yay!

320
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:35,226
Who would have ever thought
I'd be so happy for a printer?

321
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:36,892
(laughing)

322
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:39,004
- [Jared] Watch out, Calvin!

323
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:39,837
- Yay!

324
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,223
- [Jared] So, this isn't
just a regular printer.

325
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:45,017
- I know, it's heavy.

326
00:12:45,017 --> 00:12:48,955
- This is a photo printer,
and it will print pictures

327
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:53,160
up to 11 by 13, so any frame that we have

328
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,160
it'll do a special photo
print for that picture.

329
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,612
- I just told Jared my one
thing that I want to do

330
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:06,387
that's made me a little sad is
we have one billion pictures,

331
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:09,861
but they're not organized,
they're everywhere,

332
00:13:09,861 --> 00:13:12,241
and they're not printed.

333
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:14,363
I like making them into books,

334
00:13:14,363 --> 00:13:17,511
but I also want to print them too.

335
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,680
- [Jared] So, now you can print them!

336
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,565
Seriously this is way bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

337
00:13:22,565 --> 00:13:23,529
- It's so heavy.

338
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:24,362
- [Jared] Yeah.

339
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:25,195
- Where are we gonna put it?

340
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,959
This is fun because last
year we didn't do any gifts.

341
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,543
- I know, yeah.

342
00:13:28,543 --> 00:13:30,738
- Last year we had just
moved into the house.

343
00:13:30,738 --> 00:13:32,738
Okay, how did I do this?

344
00:13:33,988 --> 00:13:35,878
Yeah, it's heavy too.

345
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:37,849
I don't know how I lifted it.

346
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:40,226
- Dad, can I play with it with you?

347
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:41,059
- Sure.

348
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:43,870
Oh, wow!

349
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:48,730
It's a Camp Chef.

350
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,315
Holy cow.

351
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,940
- [Ellie] I figured that was a family...

352
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,058
- Yeah!

353
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:54,947
- [Ellie] When we take the camper out.

354
00:13:54,947 --> 00:13:56,288
- We can go and take it on the trailer.

355
00:13:56,288 --> 00:13:58,462
Oh wow, this si great.

356
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,539
Ellie, thank you so much.

357
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,042
- [Ellie] You're very welcome.

358
00:14:01,042 --> 00:14:04,618
- Look, it's for camping
and for the home and patio

359
00:14:04,618 --> 00:14:06,345
and for hunting and
fishing and for tailgating

360
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,361
which we've never done.

361
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:09,210
- [Ellie] And, for cabin and RV-ing, yep.

362
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,246
- For scouting.

363
00:14:10,246 --> 00:14:11,628
- [Ellie] Yep, you haven't
called the scouts yet.

364
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:13,639
- And, even emergency preparedness.

365
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,752
- [Ellie] Yes, all in one.

366
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:16,890
- And, I got a glove!

367
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,764
- [Ellie] Well, it's funny.

368
00:14:17,764 --> 00:14:18,962
I picked that out, and
the kids came up to me

369
00:14:18,962 --> 00:14:19,877
with the glove.

370
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:20,750
They're like, "This is for Dad."

371
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,705
I'm like, "Yeah, I actually need that.

372
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:22,701
"Thank you."

373
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:23,595
- Ellie, thank you.

374
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:24,468
- [Ellie] You're welcome.

375
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:25,342
- Thank you so much.

376
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,171
- [Ellie] We got to make
some fun Dutch oven meals

377
00:14:27,171 --> 00:14:28,166
while it's cold.

378
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,040
- Yeah.

379
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,275
Uh-oh, you're gonna call me
into the scouting program.

380
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,148
- [Ellie] I know.

381
00:14:32,148 --> 00:14:33,185
(laughing)

382
00:14:33,185 --> 00:14:34,932
Don't tell any of the neighbors.

383
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:36,151
- Delete the footage!

384
00:14:36,151 --> 00:14:37,939
- [Ellie] You guys have
had your baby blanket

385
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:39,828
since you were babies.

386
00:14:39,828 --> 00:14:42,161
Did you get another blanket?

387
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:44,806
- Yeah, it's baby.

388
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:47,143
- [Jackson] Me too, I love my blanket.

389
00:14:47,143 --> 00:14:48,910
- [Ellie] Oh, I love that.

390
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,649
- Yeah, it's baby.
- I love this blanket so much.

391
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,947
- [Ellie] Is that for your baby?

392
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,308
- Where's my baby?

393
00:14:56,308 --> 00:14:59,275
- [Ellie] Your baby is right here.

394
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:01,608
He thinks it's for the baby.

395
00:15:03,506 --> 00:15:05,923
- [Jackson] Why did we sleep?

396
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,023
That baby?

397
00:15:09,004 --> 00:15:11,052
It's Calvin's.

398
00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,556
It's a car car seat.

399
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:14,364
- [Ellie] Yeah.

400
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:17,879
Calvin thinks that
blanket is for the baby.

401
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:19,931
- [Jared] Oh, he's gonna
keep the baby nice and warm.

402
00:15:19,931 --> 00:15:21,597
(laughing)

403
00:15:21,597 --> 00:15:23,243
- [Jackson] On his face.

404
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:27,225
- [Ellie] We are turning this
room into a big baby crib.

405
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:29,237
- This is the fun zone.

406
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:30,639
- [Ellie] No one leaves this place

407
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,544
until every toy has been used and abused.

408
00:15:33,544 --> 00:15:35,698
- All right, I think it's about
time we unbox this bad boy.

409
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:37,628
I have a little advice from Cullen

410
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:40,818
because he opened it, and he
used every tool under the sun,

411
00:15:40,818 --> 00:15:44,922
so it's time to grab my
tools, so I can open this box

412
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,486
that is a mystery.

413
00:15:46,486 --> 00:15:47,726
(motor whirring)

414
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:48,782
(grunting)

415
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:49,865
Domo arigato.

416
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:54,451
So, this is taking quite a
bit longer than I thought.

417
00:15:54,451 --> 00:15:56,564
Drastic times calls for drastic measures.

418
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,148
I'll be right back.

419
00:15:58,148 --> 00:16:00,522
So, I called my brother Joel,
and I called my brother Matt,

420
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:02,905
and they coached me through
getting through the first layer.

421
00:16:02,905 --> 00:16:05,070
Upon opening the first
layer I noticed there's

422
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,411
(knocking)

423
00:16:06,411 --> 00:16:09,825
a giant wooden box here,
so not quite done yet.

424
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:11,755
Just wanted you to know I choose you first

425
00:16:11,755 --> 00:16:13,136
for gym class dodge ball.

426
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:15,270
Proud to know you, dude.

427
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,245
Bryan.

428
00:16:16,245 --> 00:16:17,708
Aw, you are great.

429
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:18,581
Thanks, Bryan.

430
00:16:18,581 --> 00:16:19,719
I think you're great too.

431
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:23,275
I'm guessing this is what I
use to open up the next part.

432
00:16:23,275 --> 00:16:25,388
Hold on, I've got to
make a few phone calls.

433
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:28,313
Just put it in and pry it back?

434
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:29,472
Oh.

435
00:16:29,472 --> 00:16:30,426
Yeah, that was so much easier

436
00:16:30,426 --> 00:16:32,377
than calling the fire department, thanks.

437
00:16:32,377 --> 00:16:33,555
Okay, talk to you later.

438
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:34,734
Bye.

439
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,522
I got it, and I didn't need any help.

440
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:38,330
(cheering)

441
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,413
Look at this!

442
00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:42,536
The Resistance.

443
00:16:42,536 --> 00:16:43,999
It's like a game box.

444
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:45,299
Boss Monster.

445
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,437
Codenames.

446
00:16:46,437 --> 00:16:48,103
Real Butter and Sea Salt?

447
00:16:48,103 --> 00:16:50,642
I've never played that
game, but I think I like it.

448
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,516
Thanks, Bryan.

449
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,426
That's awesome.

450
00:16:53,426 --> 00:16:54,645
Okay.

451
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:57,246
Excuse me, is there a Calvin in the house?

452
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,119
- [Jackson] What?

453
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,252
- Calvin, you want to try this?

454
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:01,085
- Yeah!

455
00:17:01,085 --> 00:17:01,962
- [Jared] Okay.

456
00:17:01,962 --> 00:17:02,815
- [Ellie] Where's the music?

457
00:17:02,815 --> 00:17:05,776
- [Jared] Push the button.

458
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,016
(laughing)

459
00:17:07,016 --> 00:17:10,262
- [Jackson] I want to play with it.

460
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:11,493
I want to play with it.

461
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:13,363
- [Jared] You can play with
it as soon as you're done

462
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:15,114
with your Lite-Brite.

463
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:18,362
- [Ellie] Calvin, push
the button for music.

464
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:20,839
(music chiming)

465
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,436
(microphone feedback)

466
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:27,483
(laughing)

467
00:17:27,483 --> 00:17:29,734
(babbling)

468
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:33,808
- All done.

469
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:37,524
Oh, fun.

470
00:17:39,535 --> 00:17:42,501
Well, my love, Merry Christmas.

471
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,249
- Merry Christmas, I'm
trying to figure out

472
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,590
how to boil eggs in this.

473
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,565
(laughing)

474
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,272
First thing, boil eggs.

475
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,206
I like my hat a lot.

476
00:17:49,206 --> 00:17:50,506
It keeps my ears nice and warm.

477
00:17:50,506 --> 00:17:52,802
- Oh my gosh, this morning
couldn't have been...

478
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:54,021
- More perfect?

479
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:56,530
- I just can't even believe
our kids slept all night.

480
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:59,010
- I know, that's the best
Christmas present of all.

481
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,212
(laughing)

482
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,045
- I seriously woke up and was like,

483
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:02,487
"Calvin's not next to me.

484
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:03,991
"What?"

485
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:06,592
- I am going to put my Carhartt vest on,

486
00:18:06,592 --> 00:18:08,176
keep my Carhartt hat on,

487
00:18:08,176 --> 00:18:09,883
and I'm gonna go plow the driveway

488
00:18:09,883 --> 00:18:10,960
because we had
- Sounds amazing.

489
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,301
So much snow.
- a white Christmas.

490
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:13,906
- Yahoo, I did it!

491
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:14,779
Thank you, Jared.

492
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:18,213
I used the Instant Pot for the first time,

493
00:18:18,213 --> 00:18:20,793
and I made myself some boiled eggs

494
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,439
like I do every morning.

495
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:24,369
It was really easy to use.

496
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:28,536
I'm so glad I have it, and I
always eat avocados with it.

497
00:18:31,033 --> 00:18:34,650
So, avocados and eggs are what
I usually eat for breakfast.

498
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,625
- [Jackson] What is it?

499
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,743
- [Ellie] I made eggs!

500
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:37,616
Do you want some?

501
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,571
- No.

502
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:39,953
(laughing)

503
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,985
- I figured that's what you would say.

504
00:18:41,985 --> 00:18:44,748
I'm so excited to learn how
to cook more stuff in that

505
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,748
especially soup, so fun.

506
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm glad that the kids are
playing with each other's stuff,

507
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,809
and they're okay about it, you know?

508
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:56,105
Calvin's playing with the marble run.

509
00:18:56,105 --> 00:19:00,311
He's playing with music,
and I'm eating my eggs.

510
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,079
- All right, I'm nearly all suited up.

511
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,679
I've got my Carhartt hat
on, I've got my vest on.

512
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,305
Ellie, I just need one other thing,

513
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:09,190
and it's provided in the
bag that you gave me.

514
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,246
Thank you so much.

515
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:11,404
- Gloves?

516
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:12,623
- [Jared] The SmartWool socks.

517
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:13,842
- Oh yeah, I was like, "What?"

518
00:19:13,842 --> 00:19:15,630
- [Jared] My feets got to stay warm.

519
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,662
- I literally just ate three boiled eggs,

520
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:22,269
and I'm on cloud 10, and
I'm gonna... (laughing)

521
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:24,277
- You know the reference is cloud nine,

522
00:19:24,277 --> 00:19:26,227
but you're just so much more above that

523
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:27,385
that you're cloud 10?

524
00:19:27,385 --> 00:19:29,051
- I am, that's how happy I am.

525
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,514
- [Jared] Aw, you're so sweet.

526
00:19:30,514 --> 00:19:31,388
Were they good?

527
00:19:31,388 --> 00:19:32,261
Did they taste different?

528
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,887
- Yeah, they were the
best eggs I've ever had.

529
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:34,760
- [Jared] Seriously?

530
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,898
- I'm not even kidding you.

531
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:37,016
- [Jared] That is so funny.

532
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:38,865
Thanks Instapot.

533
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,876
You made my wife happier
than I could ever.

534
00:19:40,876 --> 00:19:42,887
(laughing)

535
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:44,472
- Calvin is so attached to his blanket.

536
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:48,170
- [Ellie] This is your blanket right here.

537
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,080
Look, look how big it is.

538
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,255
- No, it's baby's!

539
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:54,232
- [Ellie] That's your baby's blanket?

540
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:55,065
- Yeah.

541
00:19:55,934 --> 00:19:58,738
- [Ellie] But, look how small this is.

542
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,424
- Yeah, it's mine.

543
00:20:00,424 --> 00:20:03,634
- [Ellie] And, now this
is yours, a big blanket!

544
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:05,259
(whining)

545
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:06,519
You don't want it?

546
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:07,535
- No.

547
00:20:07,535 --> 00:20:08,734
- Okay.

548
00:20:08,734 --> 00:20:10,989
I think it's gonna take a while for Calvin

549
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:13,305
to warm up to a new blanket.

550
00:20:13,305 --> 00:20:14,138
Calvin!

551
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,592
I think someone's tired.

552
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,014
(laughing)

553
00:20:19,014 --> 00:20:20,416
- Hey, wait!

554
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,428
- [Ellie] So, which ones
should we put in first?

555
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:23,301
- [Jackson] This one.

556
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:24,642
- [Jared] I'm looking up the instructions.

557
00:20:24,642 --> 00:20:26,694
- [Ellie] Okay, we're
figuring out how to do this.

558
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,320
You put 'em in the tumbler.

559
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,539
- This tumbler?

560
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:32,372
- [Ellie] Yep, with a grit polish,

561
00:20:33,623 --> 00:20:36,426
and they tumble for a few days.

562
00:20:36,426 --> 00:20:38,092
- Is the rocks in here?

563
00:20:38,092 --> 00:20:39,535
- Yes, until they're shiny.

564
00:20:39,535 --> 00:20:40,592
Oh, we're blurry.

565
00:20:40,592 --> 00:20:41,851
Until they're shiny.

566
00:20:41,851 --> 00:20:44,371
He is loving these rocks.

567
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,788
He screamed when he opened them.

568
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,714
I can't wait for them to
see how they turn out,

569
00:20:49,714 --> 00:20:53,881
and then they even have these
that you can put them in.

570
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:56,744
- [Jared] Nice.

571
00:20:56,744 --> 00:20:58,755
These are gonna look so cool.

572
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:00,421
- I'm gonna do these ones next.

573
00:21:00,421 --> 00:21:01,559
- Let's just start with these ones,

574
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,018
and let's get grit polish number one.

575
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,663
This will take three to five days.

576
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,537
- [Ellie] Okay.

577
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:07,593
- This one right here?

578
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:08,508
- [Ellie] Yeah.

579
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,418
- And, this will get rid
of all the rough edges,

580
00:21:10,418 --> 00:21:12,266
and then we'll do grit number two,

581
00:21:12,266 --> 00:21:14,075
and that's six to eight days,

582
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,781
and number three takes six to eight days,

583
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:17,325
and grit number four which is the polish

584
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:19,242
takes seven to 10 days.

585
00:21:20,129 --> 00:21:21,348
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness.

586
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:23,746
- So, this is gonna be
a long time, Jackson.

587
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,245
- [Ellie] But, this one will
take three to four days.

588
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:27,748
- And, we can look 'em up.

589
00:21:27,748 --> 00:21:30,308
We'll look at 'em and see
all of the stuff, okay?

590
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:32,299
- [Ellie] This is cool.

591
00:21:32,299 --> 00:21:34,494
Jackson remember at the
beach when you found

592
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,744
all those soft shiny rocks?

593
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,085
That's what this is doing.

594
00:21:39,085 --> 00:21:40,264
It's like sand.

595
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:42,113
- So, we got water in.

596
00:21:42,113 --> 00:21:43,372
- Okay.

597
00:21:43,372 --> 00:21:45,872
They're getting shiny!

598
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,720
(laughing)

599
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,163
They're gonna get shiny.
- Yes, they are.

600
00:21:49,163 --> 00:21:54,059
Oceans and rivers take
thousands and thousands of years

601
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:58,265
to make rocks smooth and
polished like gem stones,

602
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:01,272
and this is speeding up the process,

603
00:22:01,272 --> 00:22:04,462
and in four weeks we'll have gem stones

604
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:07,957
that normally would have taken
thousands of years to do.

605
00:22:07,957 --> 00:22:09,359
We'll set it for four days,

606
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,821
and can you reach this button right there?

607
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:12,630
Can you reach it?

608
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,880
(cheering)

609
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,447
Do you see it?

610
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:22,325
Is that so cool?

611
00:22:23,165 --> 00:22:24,344
(laughing)

612
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,888
Do you like that Jackson?

613
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,001
- I want to take out the rocks.

614
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,972
(laughing)

615
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:32,938
- I want to take out the rocks.

616
00:22:32,938 --> 00:22:34,787
Oh, this might be a long process.

617
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,880
Okay, it's gonna take four days,

618
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,266
so we're just gonna forget about it.

619
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:40,476
We're gonna let it do its thing,

620
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:42,217
and then in four days we'll come back.

621
00:22:42,217 --> 00:22:44,472
- One, two, three, four.

622
00:22:44,472 --> 00:22:46,727
- [Jared] That's exactly right, four days.

623
00:22:46,727 --> 00:22:48,434
- My men are ready.

624
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,277
You ready kids?

625
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,512
- [Jared] Get a little on the
snow to help you slide better.

626
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:54,345
- [Ellie] Okay, ready?

627
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:56,401
Hold on tight.

628
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,404
Hi.

629
00:22:58,404 --> 00:23:00,071
He just waved to me.

630
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:04,153
Now go really slow on that pull.

631
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:06,403
You know what you're doing.

632
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,345
(laughing)

633
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,079
Look at that!

634
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:17,075
They are so cute!

635
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,619
Jackson is trying to fall out.

636
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:20,001
Jackson's out.

637
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:23,458
- [Jared] We'll come around for him.

638
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,469
- [Ellie] He's wondering where Jackson is.

639
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:26,424
We'll go get him!

640
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:28,192
(laughing)

641
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,609
We'll go get him.

642
00:23:32,357 --> 00:23:34,607
(laughing)

643
00:23:35,729 --> 00:23:36,979
He is so happy.

644
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:44,684
(laughing)

645
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,511
(cheering)

646
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:54,239
- [Jared] Is that fun, guys?

647
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,986
- [Ellie] Okay, you pull us now.

648
00:23:55,986 --> 00:23:57,403
Jump on, jump on!

649
00:23:58,465 --> 00:23:59,927
Hurry!

650
00:23:59,927 --> 00:24:00,760
Whoa!

651
00:24:01,614 --> 00:24:03,864
(laughing)

652
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:07,052
Lost a boot!

653
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:09,954
I'll come help you.

654
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,385
(engine rumbling)

655
00:24:14,385 --> 00:24:16,233
Daddy's gonna help us make a sledding hill

656
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,326
in the backyard.

657
00:24:18,326 --> 00:24:20,845
Are you guys ready, Cal?

658
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:22,678
Okay, one, two, three.

659
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:28,838
One, two, three.

660
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,652
(laughing)

661
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:33,953
Shut up.

662
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:36,574
No, I just got to... just a minute.

663
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:39,134
Daddy's gonna make a path, is that right?

664
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:41,734
Okay, sorry just a minute.

665
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:43,055
Scoot over to the edge.

666
00:24:43,055 --> 00:24:45,920
Perfect, right there mister.

667
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,003
- Here we go!

668
00:24:51,752 --> 00:24:53,063
- [Ellie] Good!

669
00:24:53,063 --> 00:24:54,465
Do that 10 more times.

670
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:56,252
There's a four wheeler with

671
00:24:56,252 --> 00:24:58,914
one, two, three kids on the back.

672
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,164
That's awesome.

673
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:02,754
- Yay!

674
00:25:02,754 --> 00:25:04,928
(Ellie gasping)

675
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:07,712
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh, that was so awesome!

676
00:25:07,712 --> 00:25:08,666
- I want to do it again.

677
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,540
- [Ellie] Okay.

678
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,537
Was that crazy?

679
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:13,493
Do you want to do it again?

680
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:15,606
- [Jared] Hey dude, you
got to walk up the hill.

681
00:25:15,606 --> 00:25:16,561
- [Ellie] Yeah, get your butt up.

682
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:18,125
You can walk now.

683
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,765
- [Jared] Walk up the hill.

684
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:22,038
- [Ellie] No, wrong way, wrong way.

685
00:25:22,038 --> 00:25:24,679
(laughing)

686
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:27,706
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way!

687
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:28,956
Okay, Go Jacks!

688
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,781
Stay here, Cal.

689
00:25:33,863 --> 00:25:36,113
(whooping)

690
00:25:36,971 --> 00:25:38,304
One, two, three.

691
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,471
- It didn't work!

692
00:25:46,471 --> 00:25:49,132
- [Ellie] And, we got Miss Penny.

693
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,550
You gonna go on the slide too, girl?

694
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,257
Hi Miss Penn!

695
00:25:53,257 --> 00:25:55,045
Hi Miss Penny!

696
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:56,305
Merry Christmas!

697
00:25:56,305 --> 00:25:57,138
Hi girl!

698
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:01,253
Whoa, that is so fast.

699
00:26:01,253 --> 00:26:03,253
That is why Dad does it.

700
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:07,836
- And, you reinforced that bank.

701
00:26:07,836 --> 00:26:09,644
- [Ellie] Look at all this space up here

702
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,737
for you to run, girl.

703
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,992
The snow is so deep.

704
00:26:13,992 --> 00:26:14,825
Hi, girl.

705
00:26:14,825 --> 00:26:16,166
You looking for your ball?

706
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,832
Did you lose it?

707
00:26:17,832 --> 00:26:19,249
Oh, there you go.

708
00:26:21,294 --> 00:26:23,544
(cheering)

709
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,001
(laughing)

710
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:31,569
(ball squeaking)

711
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:34,652
(gentle jazzy music)

712
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,087
(grunting)

713
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,254
You missed it!

714
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:50,740
- I need to do it again.

715
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,752
- [Ellie] Well, that was silly.

716
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:53,585
Try two.

717
00:26:57,404 --> 00:26:59,654
(cheering)

718
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:02,748
- I can play the drums!

719
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:04,536
- [Ellie] Okay, should
we go watch a movie?

720
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:06,786
(grunting)

721
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,236
- Bye.

722
00:27:12,236 --> 00:27:13,486
And this, yeah.

723
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:17,295
- [Ellie] Oh, his hand!

724
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:20,099
Is this where you guys are
gonna want to sleep again?

725
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:21,182
Okay, get in.

726
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,524
Snuggle up.

727
00:27:23,524 --> 00:27:25,576
Where's your blanket, Jacks?

728
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:26,612
It's on the bed.

729
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,709
- [Jared] I'll grab it for you.

730
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:29,985
- [Ellie] Are you getting
warmed up to a new blanket?

731
00:27:29,985 --> 00:27:30,980
No?
- No.

732
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,809
- [Jared] You still like your old blanket?

733
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,820
What about you, Jackson, do
you like your new blanket?

734
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,734
- Yeah!

735
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:38,660
- It's cool, it's got airplanes,
and cool stuff on it, huh?

736
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,387
- We're gonna see if that
was a coincidence last night,

737
00:27:40,387 --> 00:27:43,353
or if Calvin really did
just sleep flipping good

738
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,771
in his own little mattress.

739
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:48,250
We are gonna watch a
Christmas movie as a family.

740
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,586
I think The Christmas Story.

741
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,460
- Yes.

742
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,984
- [Ellie] That's a fun one.

743
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:55,706
- It is a fun one, and it's also the one

744
00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:57,840
that my brother Nate was afraid of

745
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,070
because of the whole tongue
stuck to the pole scene.

746
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,899
He was scared of that
movie because of that.

747
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:05,046
- [Ellie] Oh, that's funny.

748
00:28:05,046 --> 00:28:07,075
- I think that's why we didn't
watch it very much as kids.

749
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:08,924
- We never really watched
it when we were younger.

750
00:28:08,924 --> 00:28:10,773
It was more a little bit when I got older.

751
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:11,626
- Yeah.

752
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:15,060
We always watched A Muppet
Christmas Carol, Santa Clause,

753
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,193
and It's a Wonderful Life.

754
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:19,367
Those are the three.

755
00:28:19,367 --> 00:28:23,534
- I want to see the baby
want to stick his tongue in.

756
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:27,555
- [Ellie] He's excited to
see the kid stick his tongue.

757
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:28,896
- Here's how Jackson is as a personality.

758
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:30,237
My brother is scared of that movie,

759
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:32,716
Jackson is looking forward
to that part of the movie.

760
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:34,138
He's excited about it.

761
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:35,560
- [Ellie] Okay, go sit
down and we'll watch it.

762
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,308
- Let's go.

763
00:28:37,308 --> 00:28:39,725
Well, the kids are in bed,
and this is the aftermath

764
00:28:39,725 --> 00:28:41,475
of our Christmas day.

765
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:46,686
Just wonderful, happiness,
joy, food, snacks,

766
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:51,596
laughter, fun, and social media,

767
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,923
posting pictures of those things.

768
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:57,590
- They literally played all day.

769
00:29:00,063 --> 00:29:03,802
We played Mario Kart, and
I thought that Jackson

770
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:06,280
would just hold on to the remote.

771
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,154
- [Jared] And, just wouldn't go?

772
00:29:07,154 --> 00:29:08,048
- Oh yeah.

773
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:09,633
- [Jared] He's a three year old.

774
00:29:09,633 --> 00:29:11,807
- He totally played a legitimate game.

775
00:29:11,807 --> 00:29:13,778
- Yeah, he did good in races.

776
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,830
He didn't get last place all the time.

777
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,150
He knows how to play Mario Kart.

778
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,385
- Sometimes I got last
place, and he didn't.

779
00:29:19,385 --> 00:29:20,564
(laughing)

780
00:29:20,564 --> 00:29:22,026
- And, that's with Ellie trying.

781
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,099
I've been meaning to
talk to you about that.

782
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:26,537
We need to get you better
at Mario Kart, okay?

783
00:29:26,537 --> 00:29:28,101
- I know, I know.

784
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:29,706
I want to go to Bonnie's and play there.

785
00:29:29,706 --> 00:29:31,108
- [Jared] They've got
the regular Nintendo.

786
00:29:31,108 --> 00:29:32,774
- Yes, that's what I want, so cool.

787
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:34,075
- [Jared] So fun, yeah.

788
00:29:34,075 --> 00:29:37,813
- Seriously, today could
not have been sweeter.

789
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:40,563
The boys, Calvin, ho ho, big box?

790
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:43,786
- Box, he got what he wanted.

791
00:29:43,786 --> 00:29:45,209
He got a box.

792
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:48,622
I think it's so cool that
Calvin was so excited

793
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,471
about that little baby boy.

794
00:29:50,471 --> 00:29:54,536
He's been playing with
it and caring for it.

795
00:29:54,536 --> 00:29:57,939
It's a very small example of
what Calvin is gonna be like

796
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,580
when we have our little baby.
- So excited.

797
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,485
- And, it's just fun to prepare

798
00:30:03,485 --> 00:30:06,249
and to teach him a little bit about that,

799
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:07,407
so I think that's cool.

800
00:30:07,407 --> 00:30:09,642
But, all in all I think
today was wonderful.

801
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,267
It was just really really great.

802
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,710
- I hope that you guys all had a good day,

803
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,863
and if you don't celebrate
Christmas I hope that you

804
00:30:14,863 --> 00:30:19,292
were able to get a
little feeling of the joy

805
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:21,649
that we had here, and
hopefully you guys had a fun,

806
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:24,961
wonderful day with you
or with your family.

807
00:30:24,961 --> 00:30:27,643
I just love this time of year.

808
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:28,943
We're gonna do the same thing tomorrow.

809
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:31,300
Jammies, food, snow.

810
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,277
- [Jared] Toys.

811
00:30:32,277 --> 00:30:33,639
- We're gonna do the same thing tomorrow.

812
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:34,513
- [Jared] Everything.

813
00:30:34,513 --> 00:30:35,529
(laughing)

814
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:38,332
I usually say this every year,
but I just wanted to say it.

815
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:40,364
From the bottom of our hearts, if you guys

816
00:30:40,364 --> 00:30:43,554
don't have anyone during
the holiday season

817
00:30:43,554 --> 00:30:47,191
whether it's Christmas, New
Years, let us be your family,

818
00:30:47,191 --> 00:30:48,735
let us be your friends.

819
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:52,006
Confide in us, be a part of the community,

820
00:30:52,006 --> 00:30:54,221
be friendly to those in
the comments section,

821
00:30:54,221 --> 00:30:58,812
make friends, and let
us all be here together.

822
00:30:58,812 --> 00:31:00,113
- We think about you guys all day.

823
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:02,266
We do 'cause we are constantly talking

824
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:04,349
about filming or editing.

825
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:08,052
We think about you guys,
and we see your comments,

826
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:10,599
and we read them especially
on Instagram and Twitter.

827
00:31:10,599 --> 00:31:12,773
I'm always trying to like your comments,

828
00:31:12,773 --> 00:31:15,506
so you know that I've read them.

829
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,514
It's just been a really fun four years.

830
00:31:18,514 --> 00:31:20,932
It's crazy to see our Christmas evolve

831
00:31:20,932 --> 00:31:25,422
from Jackson when he got
his rocks and a rock book

832
00:31:25,422 --> 00:31:29,140
to now where he has a few
more presents to open.

833
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,197
- [Jared] A rock tumbler.

834
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:34,179
- You know, it's been fun
to see our family grow,

835
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,946
and to see footage.

836
00:31:35,946 --> 00:31:37,978
- Yeah, and not only
that, but it's fun to see

837
00:31:37,978 --> 00:31:41,087
how far along you have come with us.

838
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,301
Some of you, this may
be your very first day,

839
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:47,487
but some of you may have
been here for four years.

840
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:49,701
Four years, that's a long time.

841
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:50,636
- [Ellie] Four Christmases.

842
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:52,485
- Yeah, four Christmases with us.

843
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:55,004
Thank you for being here with us.

844
00:31:55,004 --> 00:31:58,504
I don't know why that just put the switch.

845
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:02,188
- We're raising our family,
and we're trying to figure out

846
00:32:02,188 --> 00:32:04,545
how to raise a family,
and we're doing this,

847
00:32:04,545 --> 00:32:07,816
and it's two emotional things.

848
00:32:07,816 --> 00:32:09,233
It's been so fun.

849
00:32:10,254 --> 00:32:13,837
- We love you, and we
are grateful for you,

850
00:32:14,744 --> 00:32:16,755
so thank you for being here with us,

851
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:18,218
and I hope you guys stick around

852
00:32:18,218 --> 00:32:22,607
because we've got a lot of
fun stuff coming up in 2018.

853
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:24,659
It's going to be a great
year, but we'll get into that

854
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,873
more later when it gets
closer to New Years,

855
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:30,937
but for now from our family
to yours Merry Christmas.

856
00:32:30,937 --> 00:32:32,867
Have a wonderful holiday.

857
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,985
- Be safe.

858
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,569
- And, we will see you guys tomorrow.

859
00:32:35,569 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
