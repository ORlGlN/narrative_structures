1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,090
- Pregnancy brain at it's finest.

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,830
- Dang that was a cool
scene, we were just--

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:04,746
- I know!

4
00:00:04,746 --> 00:00:08,245
- Aw man, do you know what that means?

5
00:00:08,245 --> 00:00:09,397
- I love you buddy.

6
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:10,230
- Love you.

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,171
- [Jared] Okay, so all of
his dogs and dog blankets

8
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,918
were right here and then
he's like "errrr, no!"

9
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:18,159
Okay, you're putting them all right here.

10
00:00:18,159 --> 00:00:19,853
I got it. I see!

11
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,140
I see it now.

12
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,102
I see the inspiration.

13
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:26,047
Now you and Mommy and
Calvin are going to do

14
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:27,770
some fun stuff today and I need you

15
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,586
to be Mommy's helper, okay?

16
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:31,665
If Calvin's like "No
I don't wanna do that"

17
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,822
you say "Calvin we're gonna
be Mommy's helpers today

18
00:00:34,822 --> 00:00:36,243
and we're gonna be good for Mommy."

19
00:00:36,243 --> 00:00:37,203
Can you do that for me?

20
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,036
- Yeah.

21
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:40,632
- Yeah? Good, I love you.

22
00:00:40,632 --> 00:00:41,858
I love you so much!

23
00:00:41,858 --> 00:00:42,691
(laughs)

24
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,894
Oh I got one!

25
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,493
I got one where you wiped away.

26
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:46,967
You know what Grandma always says?

27
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:48,613
You can wipe away the kiss

28
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:51,001
but you can't wipe away the love.

29
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,867
(laughs)

30
00:00:51,867 --> 00:00:53,332
You can wipe away the kiss

31
00:00:53,332 --> 00:00:56,036
but you can't wipe away the love.

32
00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:57,995
(big kiss)

33
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:59,690
I'm gonna try and kiss you!

34
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:00,940
I'm gonna get you.

35
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,773
(kids laughing and squealing)

36
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:03,391
You're so fast!

37
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:07,401
(kids laughing and squealing)

38
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:08,425
Gotcha!

39
00:01:08,425 --> 00:01:10,851
(laughter)

40
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:12,761
- [Calvin] Got you!

41
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:14,755
- [Jared] Thanks Calvin,
you're a good helper.

42
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:15,605
(laughing)

43
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:16,452
- Don't wipe away my kiss!

44
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,035
- The kids and I are in
town and we are going

45
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:21,978
to try and find something
extra special today.

46
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:23,879
Do you remember what
we're gonna find, Jax?

47
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,712
- Baby car seat.

48
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:26,080
- [Ellie] What is it?

49
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,640
- Baby car seat.

50
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,431
- A baby car seat!

51
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,924
- Excuse me, sir.

52
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,359
I'm supposed to be doing that to you.

53
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,550
- No, I'm supposed to doing it to you.

54
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:39,635
- All right, whoever
spots the car seats first

55
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:41,816
gets to choose the treat.

56
00:01:41,816 --> 00:01:42,649
(laughing)

57
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:44,178
You know where my mind is.

58
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:45,553
It's always treats.

59
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:47,623
Can we find a car seat?

60
00:01:47,623 --> 00:01:49,980
Calverooni, can we find a car seat?

61
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,791
- [Jared] Hello.

62
00:01:51,791 --> 00:01:52,968
You got your RC car?

63
00:01:52,968 --> 00:01:53,801
- You wanna play?

64
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,011
- [Jared] Yeah, mine's in the trunk.

65
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:55,844
- Ha ha.

66
00:01:55,844 --> 00:01:56,912
- Guys! It's time for another segment

67
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:59,802
of "Joel and Jared go on a date."

68
00:01:59,802 --> 00:02:02,764
Before we go on our man-date
we had to make one stop.

69
00:02:02,764 --> 00:02:05,288
Ahem, queue the music.

70
00:02:05,288 --> 00:02:08,872
â™ª Joel and Jared go to Maverik. â™ª

71
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:10,669
- Should we toast our burritos?

72
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,086
- Boop

73
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:12,919
- Toast 'em.

74
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,752
- Delicious.

75
00:02:13,752 --> 00:02:14,585
- Clinky.

76
00:02:15,655 --> 00:02:17,740
- Okay, seat belts?

77
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,224
Check.

78
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,362
Safety first, ladies and gents.

79
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:23,015
- [Ellie] Do you see 'em?

80
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:24,630
- Yeah!

81
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,563
- [Ellie] Right here!

82
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,122
All right, looking at car
seats can be overwhelming.

83
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,500
We don't have an infant car seat anymore.

84
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,775
We always used the Graco Click Connect.

85
00:02:35,775 --> 00:02:38,718
I think this is the one
that we had with the boys

86
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:40,861
when they were younger but
now that they've gotten

87
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:44,453
older we've really liked the Chico one.

88
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,909
So I was looking at this infant car seat

89
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:49,043
but then I saw this one.

90
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:52,599
This is from Graco and it's says it's new

91
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,299
and it's the only "impact
protection properly positioned

92
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:59,195
to help protect your growing infant."

93
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:01,282
But I really did like
this cause I feel like

94
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:04,480
a lot of times when your
infants are in the carseat

95
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,122
their heads are so everywhere

96
00:03:07,122 --> 00:03:10,462
and I kinda like that this is like

97
00:03:10,462 --> 00:03:12,165
built-in to help protect your baby

98
00:03:12,165 --> 00:03:14,015
as their heads grow so I'm kinda leaning

99
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:16,910
more towards this one actually.

100
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,153
I just sent a text to Jared
to see if he has an opinion.

101
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:23,320
But it's kinda between
this one, this Graco

102
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,141
or this Chico one
- (child yelling)

103
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,338
Owie!

104
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:28,207
Between this one or that one.

105
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,745
So I'm gonna wait to hear back from Jared.

106
00:03:29,745 --> 00:03:32,298
But in the meantime I
did find a little basket

107
00:03:32,298 --> 00:03:36,302
here at Target for the baby
for all of the little toys

108
00:03:36,302 --> 00:03:38,338
and stuff in the corner of the baby room.

109
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:40,256
I like to have a little basket of toys

110
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:42,048
which I had one in there for Calvin

111
00:03:42,048 --> 00:03:44,242
but we actually moved
it into the living room.

112
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,122
Now let me go chase my toddlers.

113
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:50,862
- So the date today is
all about... (groaning)

114
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:52,958
Jeepers! RC cars.

115
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:56,093
Brian got me this RC car
for my birthday last year.

116
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,168
Thanks Brian.

117
00:03:57,168 --> 00:04:00,472
But the first ride that
I had it at my house

118
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:02,639
I crashed it and broke it.

119
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,528
Joel has Cody's RC car...

120
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:06,958
- Since Christmas.

121
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:09,085
- And it's broken too.

122
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:14,056
So our goal today is to get
these fixed at the hobby store.

123
00:04:14,056 --> 00:04:16,526
So there's a Guitar Center right there

124
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:18,976
and we might sneak in there after.

125
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,960
Joel, you should play the
drums and I'll play the guitar!

126
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,323
- We might have to jam for a second.

127
00:04:23,323 --> 00:04:24,156
- We should!

128
00:04:24,156 --> 00:04:25,998
If you guys didn't know
it, Joel plays the drums.

129
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:27,298
Or did. Or does. Or did.

130
00:04:27,298 --> 00:04:28,131
Did?

131
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:28,964
- Did.

132
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:31,333
- Does today, in just a few minutes.

133
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:34,750
(energetic guitar music)

134
00:04:39,808 --> 00:04:42,725
(wheels squeaking)

135
00:04:44,732 --> 00:04:48,792
- We just upgraded to
the coolest cart ever.

136
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:51,123
This will fit more stuff right?

137
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:52,765
Is that why you went and grabbed it?

138
00:04:52,765 --> 00:04:53,888
(laughing)

139
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,985
They're out of stock but this
is the one we're going to get.

140
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:59,983
So I'll have to go home and order it.

141
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,882
Dang it, but we at least
we got some other things

142
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:03,844
we needed, like a basket.

143
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:05,666
- [Calvin] That's my cart.

144
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,637
(Ellie laughing)

145
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:10,538
- Calvin, I said we can
eat it when we buy it okay?

146
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:11,947
- I wanna take this one out.

147
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,047
- I wanna hold this one.

148
00:05:13,047 --> 00:05:15,194
- [Ellie] Okay you hold yours,
they got their little snack.

149
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:16,027
- [Jared] Okay Joel.

150
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,639
Here it is, let's see it.

151
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,135
- But I didn't come prepared.

152
00:05:19,135 --> 00:05:20,309
Oh if I must.

153
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,799
(Jared laughing)

154
00:05:22,799 --> 00:05:24,816
(drumming)

155
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:26,011
- [Jared] Yeah!

156
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:27,026
- I don't know.

157
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,276
(drumming)

158
00:05:44,203 --> 00:05:45,767
- [Jared] Um yeah, I'm not prepared.

159
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:48,038
I haven't played, I
don't know how to do it.

160
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:48,919
That was amazing.

161
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:49,851
You know what I think we should do?

162
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,210
- What's that?

163
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,789
- I think we should start a band.

164
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:55,894
(drum roll and cymbal crashing)

165
00:05:55,894 --> 00:05:56,727
- It's a good idea.

166
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,541
- You want some salad with your chocolate?

167
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,791
(laughing)

168
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:04,695
That good?

169
00:06:05,924 --> 00:06:08,590
- Mom I didn't record that whole thing.

170
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,423
- The whole thing?

171
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:11,140
- I hit the record button after

172
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,582
to turn it off and then turn it on.

173
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,026
- I hate it when that happens.

174
00:06:14,026 --> 00:06:14,859
- I know!

175
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,497
- Well you guys look
like you're having fun.

176
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:18,130
- We did have fun, yeah.

177
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,749
We went down to the RC
store and all that, but--

178
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:22,214
- [Joel] They didn't have my parts.

179
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:25,193
- Nah, they had my parts
but Joel had to order his.

180
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:26,661
- Well dang that was a cool scene!

181
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,494
- I know!

182
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:29,243
- We were just dragging down Main Street.

183
00:06:29,243 --> 00:06:30,450
- We were, yeah!

184
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,283
It was fun.

185
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:32,366
We saw Mom.

186
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:35,551
We're looking behind us and
we're like "Is that Mom?"

187
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:36,384
Like "Is it?"

188
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,987
We could barely tell cause
the sun was reflecting

189
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,728
on your window and we're
like "That is Mom!"

190
00:06:40,728 --> 00:06:43,253
- Well when I first saw
you I thought "Is that Bo?"

191
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,076
(laughing)

192
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:48,239
I thought "When are you gonna
put some hubcaps on your car?"

193
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,511
- Hey! I've got one I think.

194
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,646
One out of four ain't bad.

195
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:54,820
Yeah, see one right there.

196
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,778
It's a good hubcap.

197
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:57,217
It's stayed long.

198
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,704
Okay, you're gonna get your hair cut?

199
00:06:58,704 --> 00:06:59,537
- I am.

200
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:00,375
- Okay well have fun.

201
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,208
- Can't wait.

202
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,041
- Okay, we'll see you later.

203
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:02,874
- Bye bye.

204
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:03,707
- Bye Joel!

205
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,424
Thanks for going on a date with me.

206
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,257
- It was a fun day.

207
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:07,090
- [Jared] Bye Bon!

208
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:10,779
- We are playing a Surprise
Slides Lightning-Fast game.

209
00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:13,824
This is pretty much like Candy Land but

210
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,775
with race cars is what we're doing.

211
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:19,754
Oh, you got the flip sign so take

212
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:22,171
any two pieces and move them.

213
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:26,192
Yep, switch 'em, there you go.

214
00:07:26,192 --> 00:07:27,795
- [Ellie] My turn.

215
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:28,628
Blue!

216
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:32,688
Who's winning?

217
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:33,714
- [Jackson] Me!

218
00:07:33,714 --> 00:07:34,601
- [Ellie] Where's your guy?

219
00:07:34,601 --> 00:07:37,041
You're holding your guy! (laughs)

220
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,902
- Red!

221
00:07:37,902 --> 00:07:39,666
- [Ellie] Red? You got red? Let's see.

222
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,286
- I'm almost to the finish line!

223
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:42,275
- [Ellie] You did get red.

224
00:07:42,275 --> 00:07:44,905
Okay where's the red square?

225
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:47,747
- (screams)

226
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:49,046
- [Ellie] He is screaming and then

227
00:07:49,046 --> 00:07:51,698
telling his dog not to scream (laughs)

228
00:07:51,698 --> 00:07:54,805
- (screams) No screaming dog.

229
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,846
- [Ellie] Good I'm glad
you told him not to scream.

230
00:07:56,846 --> 00:07:57,679
- No.

231
00:07:59,371 --> 00:08:00,704
- Hi puppy! Aww.

232
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:04,905
Can I give you a kiss puppy?

233
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:07,061
Oh he's going to bed?

234
00:08:07,061 --> 00:08:08,081
- Yeah.

235
00:08:08,081 --> 00:08:08,914
- Hi!

236
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:10,267
- [Jared] Hi! Did you guys have fun?

237
00:08:10,267 --> 00:08:11,100
- We did.

238
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,267
We'll have to order the car seat.

239
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,100
- [Jared] Oh no!

240
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,158
- Wasn't in stock.

241
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,685
- [Jared] Darn it.

242
00:08:15,685 --> 00:08:17,314
- I like that one a lot.

243
00:08:17,314 --> 00:08:18,214
- Here's the cars Mom.

244
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,172
- My head hurts.

245
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,005
What?

246
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:20,987
- Here's the cars.

247
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:21,820
- The cars?

248
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,696
- [Jared] Cool. We had
fun on our man-date.

249
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:24,535
- Oh did you?

250
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:25,493
- Did you guys go eat?

251
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:26,326
- [Jared] We did.

252
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:27,429
- The kids and I went to Zupa's.

253
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,041
- [Jared] Aww, fun.

254
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,912
- They ate chocolate
strawberries and salad.

255
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:33,589
- And Kinder eggs!

256
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:35,075
- [Jared] Oh my goodness!

257
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:36,176
Did you guys have fun with Mom?

258
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,759
- And eggs!

259
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,477
- [Jared] Were you good for Mommy?

260
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,309
- Yep.

261
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:41,436
- [Jared] Were you good boys?

262
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,270
- Yep.

263
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,196
- [Jared] Calvin were you good for Mommy?

264
00:08:43,196 --> 00:08:44,034
- Yeah.

265
00:08:44,034 --> 00:08:45,933
- You were very good
or I would not have let

266
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,554
you got a treat, huh?

267
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:48,691
- Good.

268
00:08:48,691 --> 00:08:49,809
That is so good to hear.

269
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:50,730
I'm so happy.

270
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,717
- I like going in town when it's like..

271
00:08:52,717 --> 00:08:55,184
I mean, it's fun when we
all go but when it's just me

272
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:56,971
and the boys I have a lot of fun.

273
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,885
- Good, yeah it's a lot of
fun without Dad isn't it?

274
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:03,021
- Sometimes it's different
cause it's just me

275
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:04,020
and it's like...

276
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,853
- [Jared] Special time.

277
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:05,686
- It's fun.

278
00:09:05,686 --> 00:09:06,735
- [Jared] Yeah it is, for sure.

279
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:07,867
I love my family.

280
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:08,700
- Love you.

281
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,033
(gentle soothing music)

282
00:09:55,835 --> 00:09:56,999
- [Ellie] Bye Grandma.

283
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:57,832
- Bye bye!

284
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,162
- [Ellie] Bye bye Grandma!

285
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:01,960
- Bye Grandma!

286
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,306
- Bye!!

287
00:10:03,306 --> 00:10:06,599
- That was such a fun
surprise seeing my mom today.

288
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:09,127
I just had a really good evening.

289
00:10:09,127 --> 00:10:12,390
We all went out to dinner with my friend

290
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,963
but I wanna show you guys...

291
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:15,672
Do you remember the other day in the vlog

292
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:20,579
where Jackson was looking at
baby brother's little jammy

293
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:24,984
and he was confused on
why the feet were enclosed

294
00:10:24,984 --> 00:10:28,542
and then he said he wanted
to find a jammy like that.

295
00:10:28,542 --> 00:10:32,434
When we were at Target
today we saw some and I told

296
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:36,961
Jackson to pick out a pair of
jammies that had feet in them.

297
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:39,476
And so these are the
ones that he picked out.

298
00:10:39,476 --> 00:10:41,951
And these are the ones
that Calvin picked out.

299
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:43,471
- [Jackson] And more of me.

300
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,304
- Huh?

301
00:10:44,304 --> 00:10:45,287
- [Jackson] And more of mine.

302
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:46,466
- And more of yours?

303
00:10:46,466 --> 00:10:47,769
They came in a set of two.

304
00:10:47,769 --> 00:10:49,705
The moment I got Calvin's on Jackson goes

305
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:53,751
"Oh, he's cute in those." (laughs)

306
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,509
Okay, let's see how they fit.

307
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:59,226
Oh these beat your
winter jammies for sure.

308
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,519
Do you want me to help?

309
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:01,400
Okay let's see.

310
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,233
Whoa!

311
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,922
Jackson you look awesome.

312
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:08,006
How fun! You haven't
worn jammies like that

313
00:11:08,006 --> 00:11:09,736
since you were really little.

314
00:11:09,736 --> 00:11:13,793
But you really wanted to
get some feeted pajammies.

315
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:15,421
(laughs)

316
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:17,549
- Oh my goodness gracious.

317
00:11:17,549 --> 00:11:20,475
Look at your new pajamas,
they look so good on you boys.

318
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:21,525
Do you like 'em?

319
00:11:21,525 --> 00:11:24,509
What do you say ohhh...who got 'em for ya?

320
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:25,919
(Calvin yells)

321
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,436
- Mom did.

322
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,961
- Mom did, that's so fun.

323
00:11:28,961 --> 00:11:31,188
Okay now listen, here's the deal.

324
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,087
Here's the deal, I have a deal
to make for you guys okay?

325
00:11:34,087 --> 00:11:36,675
(laughs)

326
00:11:36,675 --> 00:11:38,973
We have to go to bed at a good time.

327
00:11:38,973 --> 00:11:39,951
- No!

328
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:40,817
- Yes.

329
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:43,442
- No, no! (laughs)

330
00:11:43,442 --> 00:11:45,769
Because I'll tell you what.

331
00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:47,781
Tomorrow we're gonna wake up.

332
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:49,485
We're gonna get ready for the day

333
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:51,045
and we're gonna go on an airplane

334
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,025
- No!

335
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:52,880
- To a special place.

336
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,685
Shh, don't say where it is.

337
00:11:54,685 --> 00:11:55,760
Don't say where it is.

338
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,145
I know you want to but we can't
cause it's a surprise okay?

339
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:00,559
We need to get some sleep so we can get

340
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,299
on the airplane and go okay?

341
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,132
Sound good?

342
00:12:03,132 --> 00:12:04,764
Give me a thumbs up.

343
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:05,603
I love you buddy..

344
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:06,436
- Love you.

345
00:12:06,436 --> 00:12:07,269
- Good night.

346
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:08,102
- Can (mumbles)...

347
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,475
- Well I'm gonna go get him and I'm gonna

348
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:11,412
make sure he gets back in bed.

349
00:12:11,412 --> 00:12:13,133
That's the opposite of
what I told you to do.

350
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,307
- I'm gonna go with you.

351
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:16,341
- You stay right here and
make sure the bed stays okay?

352
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:18,110
I don't want the bed
getting up and walking away

353
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,720
cause you need to sleep on it.

354
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,553
- No, no.

355
00:12:22,897 --> 00:12:24,362
Beds are fake.

356
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:25,238
- What do you mean?

357
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:26,643
The bed could get up and walk away,

358
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:28,393
you've gotta make sure and you stay

359
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,259
so it doesn't get away okay?

360
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,092
- No.

361
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:33,474
- Yeah, do that for Daddy.

362
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:36,593
Do that for Daddy while I get Calvin okay?

363
00:12:36,593 --> 00:12:38,714
(kids laughing)

364
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:39,547
- Weee!

365
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:43,394
(kids laughing)

366
00:12:45,508 --> 00:12:47,562
- I know we should go to bed

367
00:12:47,562 --> 00:12:48,702
- We're not.

368
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,065
- But I think we're gonna
continue our ritual of...

369
00:12:50,065 --> 00:12:52,030
We'll just do one show, okay?

370
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,486
Just one show.

371
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:56,043
And that one show may turn into two shows.

372
00:12:56,043 --> 00:12:56,880
(Ellie laughs)

373
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,894
But that's all.

374
00:12:57,894 --> 00:12:59,863
And then it may be three, I don't know.

375
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,049
- Got my strawberries.

376
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,217
- I think we'll end there.

377
00:13:02,217 --> 00:13:03,170
- That's my favorite fruit.

378
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,262
Did you say we're gonna
end there? (laughs)

379
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:06,250
- No, I think we're gonna
end all three shows--

380
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,732
- They're like "Hey,
good bye guys." (laughs)

381
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,181
- Sudden ending (bumps camera)

382
00:13:09,181 --> 00:13:12,061
- Thank you guys for watching.

383
00:13:12,061 --> 00:13:14,096
I cannot wait to order the car seat.

384
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:15,649
- Yeah, I'm excited about that.

385
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,394
I can't wait to go on
an adventure tomorrow.

386
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,221
- Tomorrow. So excited.

387
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:23,064
And thanks for my sweet mom
for stopping by just to say hi.

388
00:13:23,064 --> 00:13:24,632
- It was a really sweet
moment you guys had.

389
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:25,465
- I loved it.

390
00:13:25,465 --> 00:13:27,790
I know I looked up and
you were filming it!

391
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,352
I was like "Hey you sneaky".

392
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:30,968
- Sneaky dog.

393
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:31,956
Have a wonderful night guys.

394
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:33,870
If you enjoyed the video
give it a big thumbs up

395
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,441
and we will see you next time

396
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:37,922
as we embark on a brand new adventure.

397
00:13:37,922 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
