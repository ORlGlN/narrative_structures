1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,280
- If you could travel to one warm place,

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,113
where would it be?

3
00:00:04,113 --> 00:00:05,510
♪ Bum budda bum ♪

4
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,273
- You were spotlighted today!

5
00:00:08,273 --> 00:00:09,106
- Uh-huh.

6
00:00:09,106 --> 00:00:10,580
- I feel like I could join the army

7
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:12,100
and defuse bombs for a living now.

8
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,110
- Good morning Calvin.

9
00:00:15,972 --> 00:00:16,805
Ah!

10
00:00:16,805 --> 00:00:18,880
Calvin came and woke me
up early this morning,

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,370
he was kinda whining and crying

12
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,820
and I was like, do you need to go potty?

13
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,770
And he had to go potty and he went.

14
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:26,340
I'm so proud of him.

15
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,410
Mister.

16
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,110
You've been so good to him as well, huh?

17
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:31,450
Every time he goes,
you praise him so much.

18
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:32,283
- Uh-huh.

19
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,375
- [Ellie] Okay where's your shoes?

20
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,208
(gasps)

21
00:00:35,208 --> 00:00:36,041
Go get 'em on.

22
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,368
Alright, you're on Calvin duty?

23
00:00:37,368 --> 00:00:40,310
- I'm on Calvin duty in
case he does a doody.

24
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,230
- Okay, I'll be back soon.

25
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,990
I have a chiropractor appointment.

26
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:44,823
- Okay.

27
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:45,656
- That I am not about to cancel,

28
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:48,360
that's the best thing I've
done for myself this pregnancy.

29
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,624
- [Jared] You don't want to go in there?

30
00:00:49,624 --> 00:00:50,457
- I want to go in there.

31
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:52,090
- [Ellie] Then why didn't you
stay under there, goofball?

32
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,448
- [Jared] Okay Jackson, go in there.

33
00:00:53,448 --> 00:00:55,096
- Don't leave me in here forever.

34
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,815
- Okay, just a little bit.
- I won't.

35
00:00:56,815 --> 00:00:57,742
- [Ellie] Goodbye.

36
00:00:57,742 --> 00:00:58,826
- I this one.

37
00:00:58,826 --> 00:01:01,326
- [Jared] Get in yours Calvin.

38
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:03,262
- Bye bye.

39
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:04,730
- [Jared] I've never shoved
anyone into a locker before.

40
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,690
I feel really bad.
- Bye bye.

41
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,270
- Hello.
- Hello.

42
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,738
- [Jared] Hello.

43
00:01:09,738 --> 00:01:10,637
- [Jackson] I want to do it again.

44
00:01:10,637 --> 00:01:12,285
- [Jared] Okay get in there.

45
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,020
Bye bye.
- Good bye.

46
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,460
- [Ellie] That's your new time out corner.

47
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,356
- [Jared] Okay Harry
Potter, let's go to school.

48
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,680
- [Ellie] Let's go, grab your shoes.

49
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,540
- [Jared] Oh we forgot this one.

50
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,680
- [Ellie] Come on mister, don't
pee in the corner in there.

51
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,520
- [Jared] Come on, let's go.

52
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,580
- [Ellie] He's like, I already did.

53
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,413
- Too late Mom.

54
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:30,056
Look young man, that is not
the way that you potty train.

55
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,030
(laughing)

56
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,790
Upside down on the rocking chair

57
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,790
is not how you potty train.

58
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,210
You do it on the toilet, silly.

59
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,880
You do it on the toilet, silly.

60
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,355
Okay, you ready?

61
00:01:41,355 --> 00:01:42,188
- Yeah.

62
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:43,140
- Now we're going to the bathroom,

63
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,170
not to your bedroom.

64
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,658
Oh are you gonna bonk your head?

65
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:48,810
Whoa, can you touch it?

66
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:50,546
Yeah!

67
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:53,624
(Calvin laughs)

68
00:01:53,624 --> 00:01:54,768
Wee oooh!

69
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:57,935
(lively guitar music)

70
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:01,080
Jackson, would you come
in here please right now

71
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,020
and tell Mommy what
happened at school today?

72
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,890
Come tell Mom, hurry come here.

73
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,723
Come here.

74
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,035
You have a special badge on

75
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:08,919
and I want you to show Mom.

76
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,059
So let's go, let's go, let's go.

77
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:14,160
- What did you get at school?

78
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,350
- [Jared] What does that say?

79
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,093
- [Ellie] Let me see.

80
00:02:17,093 --> 00:02:18,610
♪ Bum badda bum ♪

81
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,629
- You were spotlighted today.

82
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:21,863
- Uh-huh.

83
00:02:21,863 --> 00:02:23,535
- What did they do?

84
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:26,358
- They talked about Calvin and Pen.

85
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,147
- They talked about Calvin and Pen?

86
00:02:28,147 --> 00:02:29,010
- Uh-huh.

87
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,575
- And they talked about
how he's your brother?

88
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:32,408
- Uh-huh.

89
00:02:32,408 --> 00:02:34,330
- And did they talk about
your favorite color?

90
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,870
And your favorite food?

91
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,492
- Mmm yep.

92
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,513
- And what you like to do?

93
00:02:41,513 --> 00:02:42,346
- Yep.

94
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:44,257
- What did they say that you like to do?

95
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:45,090
- I don't--

96
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,456
- [Jared] You don't know
what you like to do?

97
00:02:46,456 --> 00:02:47,289
(Jared laughing)

98
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:49,230
- Awesome, that's fun.
- Yeah.

99
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,290
- When I was a kid, getting spotlighted

100
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,040
was my favorite thing.

101
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,873
- [Ellie] Totally.

102
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,900
- Because it's just, every
week they would do it,

103
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,000
but it's just okay, this is my turn to be

104
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
in front of the class,

105
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,390
I want to tell you what I like to do

106
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,473
and that sort of thing,

107
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,820
so getting spotlighted is fun.

108
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,421
And Jackson was spotlighted
today in pre-school.

109
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,254
- Yay.

110
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,630
- [Jared] That's cool, huh?

111
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,950
Welcome back from school buddy.

112
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,190
Did you have fun today?

113
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,023
- Yep.

114
00:03:12,023 --> 00:03:12,856
- [Jared] Good.

115
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:13,854
Are you ready to roll BK Broiler?

116
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:14,687
- Yep.

117
00:03:14,687 --> 00:03:15,860
- Let's get your shoes and socks on.

118
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,690
We're gonna go on a nice after school

119
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,243
walk with Penny and we're
taking the drone with us.

120
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,460
DJI just announced a new Mavic Air

121
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,280
and I am salivating
- dying.

122
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,113
- right now.

123
00:03:29,113 --> 00:03:31,410
I want to get my hands on that so bad.

124
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,240
So we're gonna take the Mavic Pro

125
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,430
and we're gonna fly it around.

126
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,820
And do you want to fly
it a little bit buddy?

127
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,653
Would you like that?

128
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:38,370
- I want to fly it.

129
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,050
- Okay, we're gonna make sure to show you

130
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,340
Jackson's specific footage

131
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,620
that he does, on a drone

132
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,350
on our walk with Penny in the park.

133
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:48,603
Were you laughing at me doing that?

134
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,438
- I was making fun of you.

135
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,200
- You were making fun of me?

136
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,540
Why are you making fun of me,

137
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,510
laughing at me, doing that?

138
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,810
- I am gonna stay here.

139
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,150
I am ready for a bunch of seven year olds,

140
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,983
eight year olds--

141
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,210
- [Jared] Nine, eight and
nine year olds, right?

142
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,070
- To come over and we're cooking

143
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,640
for activity days tonight.

144
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,120
- A lot of these girls
that are coming over

145
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,800
were in my class that I
used to teach in church.

146
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,210
Calvin is taking a nap.

147
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,289
He's had a rough day, let's just say that.

148
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,090
- Yeah, potty training's
been emotional for him.

149
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,980
- [Jared] Yes it has.

150
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,829
It's been rough.

151
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,439
Alright Penny is comping at the bit,

152
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,000
to go on an adventure.

153
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,240
I say we let her go.

154
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,570
You ready for this?

155
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:25,310
What do we say when we want to let her go?

156
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,143
- Take a break.

157
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:26,976
- [Jared] That's right.

158
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:27,809
Come here Penny.

159
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,282
Take a break!

160
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,214
(Jared laughs)

161
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:31,430
- [Jackson] She loves running.

162
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,835
- [Jared] Yes she does.

163
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:35,418
(bright music)

164
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,481
Okay, how was that, was that fun?

165
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:23,314
- Uh-huh.

166
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:24,223
- [Jared] Are you ready to go?

167
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:25,056
- Yeah.

168
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:26,130
- [Jared] It's pretty chilly outside, huh?

169
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,963
- Uh-huh.

170
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:27,796
- Come on Penny let's go.

171
00:05:27,796 --> 00:05:29,390
That's my girl.

172
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,240
Okay let's get going.

173
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,280
Playing in the snow is so much fun,

174
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,910
but I am ready for some warm weather.

175
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,670
I know it's only January.

176
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,350
We still have about three
months left of this,

177
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,100
maybe two and a half, I don't know.

178
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,830
You never know with the weather in Utah.

179
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,670
You know, after awhile in the wintertime,

180
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,340
you just get the winter blues.

181
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,860
And I'm ready for some sun,

182
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,300
ready for some warm weather.

183
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,420
Are you ready for some warm weather

184
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,763
or do you like the cold weather?

185
00:05:52,763 --> 00:05:53,660
- The warm weather.

186
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,493
- The warm weather?

187
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:55,650
Yeah that's pretty nice, huh?

188
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:58,750
If you could travel to one warm place,

189
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,600
where would it be,

190
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,990
whether it be for a week,

191
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,310
for a lifetime,

192
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,203
one warm place, where
would you like to go?

193
00:06:04,203 --> 00:06:05,920
Let me know in the comments down below.

194
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,870
- I've been a little missing in action

195
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,200
because of potty training right now.

196
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,610
Calvin woke up from a nap and he's just,

197
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,480
I think it's just draining for toddlers.

198
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,910
I can only imagine how
draining it is for them,

199
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,440
if it's tiring for us, you know?

200
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
(Calvin yelling)

201
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,850
He's in there, he's really sad right now.

202
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,770
But I wanted to show you guys

203
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,440
what we made tonight with
the girls for activity days.

204
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,780
Chicken noodle soup.

205
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,070
So we did rotisserie chicken,

206
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,440
but my partner, my friend,

207
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,160
she did the broth,

208
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,160
where she had the bones and
water and got her own broth.

209
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:41,720
So we did broth,

210
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,880
and then the girls cut up all the stuff,

211
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,020
put it in there and we did toast,

212
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,430
some of it got burnt,

213
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,263
but the girls loved it,

214
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:50,270
they loved cooking,

215
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,890
they loved eating it all up.

216
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,540
And it was a really fun night.

217
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,930
I'm looking in the viewfinder

218
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,910
and I'm like, is that me?

219
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,750
I totally look pregnant today.

220
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,660
And I like that, it's just weird,

221
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,410
you don't look at yourself all that much,

222
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,270
so when I opened the
viewfinder, I was like,

223
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,720
oh I look very pregnant today.

224
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,030
I'm gonna be 18 weeks this week guys.

225
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,120
There's my baby bump.

226
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,010
Can't even believe it,

227
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:16,330
so I'm just hurrying
cleaning up the kitchen,

228
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,680
so I can get on the night

229
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,870
with finishing up working with Calvin

230
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,080
and putting the boys to bed.

231
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,920
- Parents I hope you can relate to this,

232
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,600
because I don't know,

233
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,020
do you ever feel like when you have kids

234
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,730
who are on edge,

235
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,840
you are literally trying to defuse a bomb,

236
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,180
like you are going
through every last thing

237
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,350
so delicately and if you
do something wrong, boom!

238
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,640
You're done, you're toast,

239
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,410
the bomb went off.

240
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:43,370
You know what I mean?
- Totes.

241
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,830
- Remember it took us a long time

242
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,930
when Jackson would get mad,

243
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,100
he would hit his head--

244
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:48,933
- [Jared] Oh yeah.

245
00:07:48,933 --> 00:07:51,382
- on the floor when he was a toddler.

246
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:54,267
Just staring to talk, just
was getting really upset

247
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,190
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

248
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,550
- and that was hard for us.

249
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,383
- [Jared] Really hard.

250
00:07:57,383 --> 00:07:58,610
- And with him, we were trying

251
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,450
to teach him, you can't do that.

252
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,860
And I just remember for a long time

253
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,010
that was diffusing.

254
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,310
- Yeah.
- That situation.

255
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:07,190
- And Calvin right now,
that's kinda where we are.

256
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,420
He just woke up from a nap.

257
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,930
And that's when it's the worst.

258
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,027
That's when it's atom bomb,

259
00:08:12,027 --> 00:08:14,800
when they just wake up from
naps and they're cranky.

260
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,936
- Well he was so tired today.

261
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,250
I went in the room

262
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,810
and just sat in the rocking chair

263
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,410
and I'm like, I'm gonna rock
you or you can just cry.

264
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,220
And then soon he got in
my lap and I rocked him

265
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,210
and he fell asleep.

266
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,043
- [Jared] Oh that's cute.

267
00:08:27,043 --> 00:08:28,860
- He was just so done for the day.

268
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,210
- Well and the thing is,

269
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,284
when you're doing all of this stuff,

270
00:08:33,284 --> 00:08:37,829
it's mentally and physically
tiring for Calvin,

271
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,080
just as much us, but for Calvin too,

272
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,320
so we're trying to get
him on the schedule,

273
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,490
we're trying to do all of
this potty training stuff,

274
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,750
he's trying to figure out himself.

275
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,570
And it's funny, because whenever
we're doing dog training,

276
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,540
Penny does the same thing.

277
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,520
She'll get a little frustrated,

278
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,960
she'll be like rarrarrra,

279
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,793
(Ellie laughs)

280
00:08:56,793 --> 00:08:59,060
until she understands what
I'm trying to teach her

281
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,330
and once she does, she's
like oh I get it finally.

282
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,040
So we go through these mental
- And then she's exhausted.

283
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,800
- and physical exhaustion,

284
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,161
and then after, every time
after a training session,

285
00:09:07,161 --> 00:09:10,810
Penny zonks out, she is tired.

286
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:13,410
So she always takes a nap
after a training session.

287
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,350
So okay I feel like I've defused a bomb.

288
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,103
The kids are good, both of them.

289
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:20,760
They're having a great time together.

290
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,560
And I feel like I could join the army

291
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,110
and defuse bombs for a living now.

292
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,770
It's just one of those days.

293
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,960
You remember what I said
about disassembling a bomb,

294
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,190
I don't know, what, 30 seconds ago?

295
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,810
Well let me show you this.

296
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,250
It's 10 pm and I've got a visitor.

297
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,756
Hey.

298
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,770
(Jared laughs)

299
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,080
What are you doing?

300
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,100
What are you doing young man?

301
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,770
You're just not sleeping tonight?

302
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,703
Bye.

303
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,110
Oh my goodness, it's
going to be a rough night.

304
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,400
And I'm just gonna say it out there,

305
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,900
because it's going to be.

306
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,230
But we're gonna do the best
that we can with Calvin.

307
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,710
He's going to be up for late tonight.

308
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,170
I think we're at the point in time

309
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,460
where Calvin is just done with naps.

310
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,120
And it's the transition point,

311
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,870
where it's harder in
the middle of the day,

312
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,610
but he at least goes to bed at night.

313
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,960
He had a nap today

314
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,120
and it was a pretty late nap,

315
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
so that's why he's up so late

316
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,350
and just not sleeping, but

317
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,183
we can do this.

318
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:19,840
- [Ellie] Lots of transitions
for this little guy.

319
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,810
- Yeah, he's going through
lots of transitions,

320
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:22,760
that's right Ellie.

321
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,460
Potty training, going from naps,

322
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,850
I think that's a big reason why they

323
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,580
call them the terrible twos.

324
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,840
But don't worry, as
soon as you turn three,

325
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,260
all of that goes away.

326
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,983
- [Ellie] Actually three was hard.

327
00:10:34,983 --> 00:10:37,120
- Three was harder for Jackson.

328
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,953
- [Ellie] But life was grand.

329
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:39,520
- Yes, oh and this is,

330
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,898
yeah I don't wanna
think we're complaining.

331
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:42,640
We're explaining.
- Oh no, life is grand.

332
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,630
- [Ellie] We're in the thick of it.

333
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,520
- Yeah.

334
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,353
(Ellie laughs)

335
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,190
We're in the trenches right now

336
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,140
and we're going through it.

337
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,960
So, hey, thanks for watching guys.

338
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,560
I hope some of you are
doing through it with us.

339
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,915
- [Ellie] O-M-G yes.

340
00:10:54,915 --> 00:10:55,930
(Jared laughs)

341
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,180
- [Jared] Okay, Calvin,
can you say goodnight

342
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,013
to our friends?

343
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,510
No.
- That's a big fat no.

344
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,410
- [Jared] Okay, well we're
just gonna say goodnight.

345
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,810
Thank you guys for watching
and we will see you tomorrow.

346
00:11:04,810 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
