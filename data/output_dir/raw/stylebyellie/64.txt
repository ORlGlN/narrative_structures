1
00:00:00,088 --> 00:00:02,201
- This is gonna be us when we're old.

2
00:00:02,201 --> 00:00:03,207
That's a needle.

3
00:00:03,207 --> 00:00:04,131
I am so proud of him.

4
00:00:04,131 --> 00:00:05,948
I can't even believe that.

5
00:00:05,948 --> 00:00:08,073
- [Child] What the heck?

6
00:00:08,073 --> 00:00:10,490
(soft music)

7
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,688
- Boys, how come you are so cute?

8
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,434
Are you ever naughty?

9
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:18,673
Do you ever get in trouble?

10
00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:19,506
- Nope.

11
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:20,684
- You don't?

12
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:21,517
- Uh-uh.

13
00:00:21,517 --> 00:00:24,877
- Do you ever get sent to the corner?

14
00:00:24,877 --> 00:00:26,457
- When I'm naughty.

15
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,159
- When you're naughty?

16
00:00:28,159 --> 00:00:28,992
(laughing)

17
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:31,019
I think that answers my question.

18
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:32,686
I told the camera, I'm like,

19
00:00:32,686 --> 00:00:33,912
you're so cute, and then I'm like,

20
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:36,310
I always say that 'cause mommas, you know,

21
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,368
we always think our babies are cute.

22
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:41,293
But we have an early
morning, busy morning.

23
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:43,320
Threw a hat on, I'm good to go.

24
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,175
Going to the dermatologist

25
00:00:45,175 --> 00:00:47,513
to check out that bad boy.

26
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,659
My little freckle that I
think turned into a mole.

27
00:00:49,659 --> 00:00:52,910
Joel thinks it's a zit under the freckle,

28
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,399
so maybe that's what it is.

29
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,822
Just to be cautious.

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,108
Jared and I have a ton of spots

31
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:59,784
all over our body that I
want checked out anyway,

32
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:01,451
so we are going to the dermato...

33
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,311
Well, school, dermatologist,

34
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:05,614
out to lunch, grocery shopping.

35
00:01:05,614 --> 00:01:06,937
You know, the whole spiel.

36
00:01:06,937 --> 00:01:07,999
That's what we're doing.

37
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:12,999
- How did you know if I drinked
all of your chocolate milk?

38
00:01:13,217 --> 00:01:15,665
- Because it was mine and I saw it.

39
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:16,498
(laughing)

40
00:01:16,498 --> 00:01:19,581
Mr. Jackson, I want to show everyone,

41
00:01:20,563 --> 00:01:23,864
I am proud of you for
wearing different shoes!

42
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:25,487
These still fit pretty good.

43
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:29,222
Jackson's been obsessed
with those little gray shoes

44
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,350
that you've had since last summer

45
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,876
and I think they don't really fit anymore.

46
00:01:33,876 --> 00:01:35,588
So now you're wearing those.

47
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:36,921
And I like them.

48
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:39,296
Okay, let's go to school.

49
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:41,282
You wanted me to take you today.

50
00:01:41,282 --> 00:01:43,459
Hey, I love taking you to school.

51
00:01:43,459 --> 00:01:44,991
You drive yourself, you've got it.

52
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:45,964
See ya.

53
00:01:45,964 --> 00:01:46,797
- No.

54
00:01:46,797 --> 00:01:47,751
- The button's already started.

55
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:50,194
Just go in, push the gas, you're good.

56
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:51,027
- No!

57
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:51,860
(laughing)

58
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:52,693
- Okay, I'll bring you.

59
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:53,890
True story, my brother, Bo,

60
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,852
when he was like two and a half or three,

61
00:01:55,852 --> 00:01:58,519
ran my dad's car into the house.

62
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:00,776
It was a legit thing.

63
00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:03,213
I think he undid the
emergency brake or something

64
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:04,106
and it rolled,

65
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:06,740
or he actually started it and it went,

66
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,781
but that happened.

67
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:09,002
Oh, I think they like us.

68
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:09,835
- I think do, too.

69
00:02:09,836 --> 00:02:10,669
(laughing)

70
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,502
We've been giving good impressions.

71
00:02:11,502 --> 00:02:12,984
I told them that we need to have them

72
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:14,458
take a picture of us in our gowns

73
00:02:14,458 --> 00:02:16,571
and they're like, oh, okay.

74
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:17,404
(laughing)

75
00:02:17,404 --> 00:02:18,800
- They laughed 'cause it was funny.

76
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,024
Calvin was very upset.

77
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:24,411
He's like why are your shoes off?

78
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,234
This is gonna be us when we're old.

79
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:27,067
(laughing)

80
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:29,537
- Don't worry, honey,
I've got your gown today.

81
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:30,370
- Thank you.

82
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,107
Make sure my butt isn't showing.

83
00:02:32,107 --> 00:02:33,084
- You look cute in a gown.

84
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:34,942
I think you should have
one in like six months

85
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:36,511
and we'll do this all over again.

86
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:37,352
(laughing)

87
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:38,464
But in a different office.

88
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,131
Hey you, Calvin, should
we buy more diapers?

89
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:46,742
Should we go potty in the toilet?

90
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:47,575
(laughing)

91
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:50,028
He's like, oh, you wanna go now.

92
00:02:50,028 --> 00:02:52,611
- Calvin has been doing awesome

93
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:56,615
with going poo in the potty.

94
00:02:56,615 --> 00:02:57,801
Awesome.

95
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:59,483
I'm really proud of him.

96
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,422
That's a needle.

97
00:03:00,422 --> 00:03:02,830
What are they doing?

98
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,260
- Dad's head.

99
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,380
- Dad's head?

100
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,907
Poking it?

101
00:03:06,907 --> 00:03:08,837
Were you worried?

102
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:09,793
- Your turn.

103
00:03:09,793 --> 00:03:11,354
(laughing)

104
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:13,078
Are they gonna poke her?

105
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:13,911
Yeah.

106
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:15,305
Here they go.

107
00:03:15,305 --> 00:03:17,733
- The poke is not even bad.

108
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,071
- Yeah, it's the injection part.

109
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:20,571
You feel the burn?

110
00:03:23,032 --> 00:03:26,177
- So this spot on my
face is just a freckle

111
00:03:26,177 --> 00:03:28,563
with a zit under it and it's not a mole.

112
00:03:28,563 --> 00:03:30,232
But I'm still glad we went in.

113
00:03:30,232 --> 00:03:32,072
I'm not gonna lie, I felt a little like

114
00:03:32,072 --> 00:03:35,974
I know we're young, but
I did have a really dark,

115
00:03:35,974 --> 00:03:38,982
pre-cancerous spot on my back that he saw

116
00:03:38,982 --> 00:03:40,972
and he's like, yeah, that needs to go.

117
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:43,276
And then we also removed
a bunch of other moles

118
00:03:43,276 --> 00:03:46,051
that were just obnoxious, you know,

119
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,255
that we just wanted to get off.

120
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:48,828
So I'm so glad that we went in.

121
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:51,049
I think my family's had
a huge wake-up call,

122
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:52,625
especially with my aunt,

123
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:56,107
this last few years of
just really making sure

124
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,751
if you think something,
just go get it checked out.

125
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:00,500
My dad had a cancer spot.

126
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,539
- My dad had a cancer spot.

127
00:04:01,539 --> 00:04:04,112
- Your dad had a cancerous melanoma spot.

128
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:06,771
- Yeah, so it's just good
to be on top of things,

129
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:09,237
to catch them early, 'cause
it's always better to do that.

130
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,369
So, you know,

131
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,376
while it might seem a
little silly to be like...

132
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:14,993
- At the moment I felt silly,
but I'm glad we did it.

133
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,753
- Yeah, I'm glad we did it, too

134
00:04:16,753 --> 00:04:18,142
because knowledge is power.

135
00:04:18,142 --> 00:04:19,958
And baby, you're powerful.

136
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,182
(laughing)

137
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:22,908
- So, side note, I was laughing

138
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:24,834
and the doctor looked at me and he goes,

139
00:04:24,834 --> 00:04:26,525
Bonnie's sister?

140
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:30,263
He knew instantly when I started laughing

141
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:32,457
that I was Bonnie's sister.

142
00:04:32,457 --> 00:04:34,120
- There's something about your laughs.

143
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,432
- I love it. (laughing)

144
00:04:35,432 --> 00:04:36,711
- You especially.

145
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,294
(screaming)

146
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:39,127
- I loved it.

147
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:40,220
I thought it was so cute.

148
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,379
He used to work with Bonnie

149
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,868
and I think I found me
a nice place to go to

150
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,344
for some skin treatments.

151
00:04:47,344 --> 00:04:49,120
I don't think I've ever gone to a place

152
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,487
and have had a facial.

153
00:04:51,487 --> 00:04:53,400
And I would love to do that.

154
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,671
This year, I'm going to be 27 in April,

155
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,308
and I think it would be really fun

156
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:00,858
to go do a spa day at
the dermatology office

157
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:02,553
and do, like, skin stuff.

158
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,820
Alright, when the neighborhood
kids get home from school,

159
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,720
that will be all the way charged.

160
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,608
You wanna do that one?

161
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:10,902
You want your bike, Cal?

162
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:12,158
It's chilly.

163
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,082
- It's chilly.

164
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:16,981
- But the weather has been
pretty good for January.

165
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,875
We're actually gonna spend
a little time outside.

166
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:22,228
Calvin just fell asleep
at the grocery store.

167
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:23,502
Holy moly.

168
00:05:23,502 --> 00:05:25,065
Glad you're happy now, mister.

169
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:26,982
Oh, he's already on it.

170
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,184
Good job, Jacks!

171
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:33,220
Jackson, you're doing so good!

172
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,059
Jackson!

173
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:35,983
And I can hear it beeping,
so we're gonna need

174
00:05:35,983 --> 00:05:37,346
to charge it soon, okay?

175
00:05:37,346 --> 00:05:39,222
Whoa, I am so proud of him!

176
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:40,744
I can't even believe that!

177
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:43,511
There's this new dog place
that opened up a while ago

178
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,279
that they have where
you can bring your dog,

179
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,261
and the dogs interact,

180
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,432
and then you can do
some training sessions.

181
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,879
So Jared and Penny just
got back from that.

182
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:51,712
How was it?

183
00:05:51,712 --> 00:05:53,060
- It was good.

184
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,353
We've been working on a few things.

185
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:56,675
- Hi, Miss Pen.

186
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:57,714
- Hey, that's a good girl.

187
00:05:57,714 --> 00:05:59,223
Can you sit for me?

188
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,458
- That's a good girl, not to run up.

189
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,947
I mean it used to be where she, oh see,

190
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:03,485
ooh ooh ooh.

191
00:06:03,485 --> 00:06:05,465
She's gone to play with the neighbor.

192
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,298
- Touch.

193
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:07,597
Good girl!

194
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:10,438
- This kid is breaking out
all the cool garage toys.

195
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:12,058
When did you grow up, Jacks?

196
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,449
- Because I did.

197
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,610
- You just did?

198
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,430
Right, hover boards and skateboards now?

199
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,933
Think you're pretty cool
'cause you rode a bike

200
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,337
at two and a half?

201
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,170
- Uh huh.

202
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,003
(laughing)

203
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:22,750
- This summer, we're
gonna put you on a bike

204
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,675
and see how it goes.

205
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,374
A legit bike that doesn't have
training wheels or anything.

206
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:28,249
Holy moly!

207
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:31,465
Who thought it would be so
fun putting groceries away?

208
00:06:31,465 --> 00:06:33,591
This is the best!

209
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:36,758
A back rub and putting groceries away?

210
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:40,661
He came up to me and
started rubbing my back.

211
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:41,716
What are you rubbing it with?

212
00:06:41,716 --> 00:06:43,149
That's awesome!

213
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:43,983
Good job, dad.

214
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,561
- Have I been replaced?

215
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:46,672
- I love it.

216
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:47,929
- I'm not sure if I
should be upset or happy.

217
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,929
(music)

218
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:55,569
- I thought this shirt was really pretty.

219
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,875
- [Mom] What, purple and white?

220
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,369
- Yes, so it'll be fun with pies.

221
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,202
I can't wait!

222
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,634
- [Mom] I know it.

223
00:07:01,634 --> 00:07:02,512
I know it.

224
00:07:02,512 --> 00:07:04,201
- My mom and I are making pies tomorrow

225
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:05,566
for our cookbook,

226
00:07:05,566 --> 00:07:07,856
and then next week we are going to Ruby's

227
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:08,977
and then that's a wrap.

228
00:07:08,977 --> 00:07:09,894
So excited!

229
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:11,829
- Hey!

230
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,829
(music)

231
00:07:16,133 --> 00:07:20,096
- Jackson, this is the last of the rocks.

232
00:07:20,096 --> 00:07:21,989
Only the last cycle

233
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:23,888
and then you're ready to keep all of them.

234
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:24,731
- Can you believe that?

235
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:26,168
One more cycle.

236
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:27,085
Here we go.

237
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,648
- What the heck?

238
00:07:30,648 --> 00:07:32,163
- Whoa!

239
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:33,330
What the heck?

240
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,922
I wanna keep all of them.

241
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,000
- Okay.

242
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,833
- You can!

243
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:38,892
Oh my gosh!

244
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:39,938
- Wow!

245
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:40,771
- Oh my heck!

246
00:07:40,771 --> 00:07:41,604
- Oh my heck!

247
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,604
- Look at this gray one!

248
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:46,731
- I love that one.

249
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:47,960
- These look so great, Jackson.

250
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,793
Guess what?

251
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:50,350
We only have one more cycle,

252
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,751
and guess how long it is?

253
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:52,584
- What?

254
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,196
- Ten days.

255
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,029
All the grooves are smooth

256
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:56,714
and now this is gonna make it shiny.

257
00:07:56,714 --> 00:07:58,914
- You know how these are all ready to go?

258
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:00,585
This next one will make them shiny.

259
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:03,520
So take one out 'cause we're
taking one out each cycle.

260
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,065
- Maybe one of the green ones.

261
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,323
- Do you wanna take one out?

262
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:08,875
- I wanna take all of the big green ones.

263
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:09,903
- Just those ones, okay?

264
00:08:09,903 --> 00:08:11,791
- Yeah, just one, because
then when you're all done,

265
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,303
you can have all of them out.

266
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:14,823
So put one green one back.

267
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:15,656
Perfect.

268
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:17,156
Keep that one out.

269
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:19,641
- Good job, bud.

270
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:22,131
Alright, now this last one is ten days.

271
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:25,134
So we've got one, two, three, four, five,

272
00:08:25,134 --> 00:08:27,166
six, seven, days on this,

273
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,803
so we have to push it twice.

274
00:08:28,803 --> 00:08:30,801
So hit set until it gets to seven.

275
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,671
Okay, keep pushing it.

276
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:32,517
Boom.

277
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:35,296
Push, push, push, push, push.

278
00:08:35,296 --> 00:08:36,403
Now hit the power button.

279
00:08:36,403 --> 00:08:37,501
Good job.

280
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:38,648
Okay, there it goes.

281
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:39,966
Last round.

282
00:08:39,966 --> 00:08:40,831
(laughing)

283
00:08:40,831 --> 00:08:41,842
Well, golly gee willakers,

284
00:08:41,842 --> 00:08:43,108
look at this place.

285
00:08:43,109 --> 00:08:44,810
My oh my, goodbye baseball,

286
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:47,377
Ellie's on the phone with Ginger.

287
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:50,108
Ellie and I have been working
the past couple of hours.

288
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:51,784
I've been out in the garage cleaning up.

289
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:56,289
She's been in here, cleaning
all of this stuff beautifully

290
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:59,680
because they have a photo shoot
for the cook book tomorrow!

291
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,220
And this is gonna be the
scene of the cook book,

292
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,564
part of it, anyway.

293
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:05,852
We're hitting all the
different siblings' houses

294
00:09:05,852 --> 00:09:07,032
for the cook book.

295
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,020
(laughing)

296
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,009
But this is not for the cook book.

297
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,286
This is for us.

298
00:09:11,286 --> 00:09:13,267
As we wind down our night tonight,

299
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,609
we are having nachos.

300
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:15,827
Not the healthiest thing,

301
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:17,736
but certainly one of the
most delicious things.

302
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:18,569
- I made dinner!

303
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:19,863
- Yeah, goulash.

304
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:21,634
Which is very healthy and
delicious to the taste.

305
00:09:21,634 --> 00:09:22,598
- You're good.

306
00:09:22,598 --> 00:09:23,962
- We're gonna watch a show tonight

307
00:09:23,962 --> 00:09:25,230
as we wind down the night

308
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,476
and we're gonna have nachos

309
00:09:26,476 --> 00:09:27,501
because that's the thing.

310
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,530
The kids are asleep.

311
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,477
They did really great
tonight going to bed,

312
00:09:30,477 --> 00:09:34,132
and they love sharing a
bedroom and sharing a bed.

313
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:37,077
And it's just fun to have that, two boys.

314
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,518
I can't wait to have three boys.

315
00:09:38,518 --> 00:09:39,733
Three boys!

316
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:41,945
Like, oh, I'm just a happy dad right now.

317
00:09:41,945 --> 00:09:43,857
I felt the baby today, again.

318
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:44,814
How cool is that?

319
00:09:44,814 --> 00:09:48,188
That I could just reach down, put my hand

320
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,945
on my wife's belly, and
feel our wiggly baby boy.

321
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:53,639
Do I have your full, undivided attention

322
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,997
now that you are done talking
to your friend Ginger?

323
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,898
- Yes, I'm just sending her pictures,

324
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:01,567
so no, you don't have
my undivided attention.

325
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,622
Okay, now you do.

326
00:10:02,622 --> 00:10:03,455
What's up?

327
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,201
- I was going to say, as
we end the vlog tonight,

328
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,614
I wanted to let you know that

329
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:08,551
I have been going through the survey

330
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:10,544
and looking at the things that
you have recommended for us

331
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,524
and I'm so excited to do those things.

332
00:10:12,524 --> 00:10:14,815
A lot of them have been
outdoor activities,

333
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:17,838
which I am excited to use the trailer for.

334
00:10:17,838 --> 00:10:19,975
So, once it warms up a little bit,

335
00:10:19,975 --> 00:10:22,076
like, I'm so excited to do those things.

336
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:25,294
- I think it would be fun to do one trip

337
00:10:25,294 --> 00:10:27,412
before the baby comes.

338
00:10:27,412 --> 00:10:29,556
- Yeah, look at your little baby bump.

339
00:10:29,556 --> 00:10:31,129
- I mean, it's a little
crazy, like me pregnant,

340
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:32,620
you know, traveling.

341
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,532
Sleeping in a camper.
- Yeah.

342
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,830
And that's why it's cool.

343
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,487
- It's fun, but I can't do
that with a two-month-old,

344
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:38,320
you know?

345
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,153
- Not yet!

346
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:39,986
(laughing)

347
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:41,116
That's where we're gonna end the vlog.

348
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:42,181
Thank you guys so much for watching.

349
00:10:42,181 --> 00:10:44,313
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up.

350
00:10:44,313 --> 00:10:46,861
If you're new to this channel,
hit that subscribe button.

351
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:48,616
Oh, one more thing before we take off.

352
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:49,738
Weird thing today.

353
00:10:49,738 --> 00:10:53,290
So our video today is currently
trending in number five.

354
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,832
- I don't know what
YouTube does to do that.

355
00:10:56,832 --> 00:10:59,626
- I have no idea because
below us, number six,

356
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:02,434
is Unbox Therapy, and they
have over 700,000 views

357
00:11:02,434 --> 00:11:04,786
on their video today, and
we have like 50,000 views

358
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:06,512
on our video as of right now.

359
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:08,049
Real time is a little different,

360
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,137
but maybe the views don't matter

361
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:10,995
and this is like Whose Line is it Anyway?

362
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,203
Anyway, the points don't matter,
