1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:04,334
(bright funky music)

2
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:16,779
- Happy fall break.

3
00:00:16,779 --> 00:00:17,995
- Good morning.

4
00:00:17,995 --> 00:00:19,494
I can't think of a better way

5
00:00:19,494 --> 00:00:21,638
to spend the freezing morning

6
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,390
than in the hot tub.

7
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,223
- I hope you guys are gonna have

8
00:00:24,223 --> 00:00:25,419
- Happy fall break.

9
00:00:25,419 --> 00:00:27,818
- Happy fall break.

10
00:00:27,818 --> 00:00:30,151
(splashing)

11
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:36,669
(Ellie laughing)

12
00:00:38,142 --> 00:00:41,420
- [Jared] Are you gonna let go?

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,854
(laughing)

14
00:00:43,854 --> 00:00:44,854
Okay let go.

15
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:46,799
- Swim!

16
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,536
- [Jared] Let got and swim.

17
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:51,352
- Let go and swim.

18
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,185
- Ahhhh.

19
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,120
(yelling)

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,974
So we have what we feel like
is this beautiful scenery.

21
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:07,026
And we've seen a lot
of people on Pinterest,

22
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:11,659
Instagram doing these
underwater photo shoots,

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:12,949
so we were like,

24
00:01:12,949 --> 00:01:14,716
let's try and imitate this

25
00:01:14,716 --> 00:01:16,255
and Ellie thinks it's gonna turn out

26
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:17,319
(splashing)

27
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:20,108
really good, and I'm not sure
how well it's gonna turn out,

28
00:01:20,108 --> 00:01:21,996
but we're gonna try it nonetheless.

29
00:01:21,996 --> 00:01:23,475
- I just think it'll be hilarious

30
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:25,172
compared to Bryan and Missy's like really

31
00:01:25,172 --> 00:01:27,141
beautiful photo shoot,
where everyone can swim,

32
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,558
and then us, where we're like

33
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,049
- One two three go.

34
00:01:37,626 --> 00:01:38,459
Whoa.

35
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:42,604
(sweet music)

36
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:48,791
(carnival music)

37
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:51,260
So we told you guys before

38
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,501
that we got a bunch of different costumes

39
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,013
for all the seasons, for
the holidays and everything.

40
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:58,908
And Jackson wants nothing
to do with one costume

41
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,306
in particular that he had on earlier.

42
00:02:01,306 --> 00:02:04,470
So he has his Spiderman
outfit on right now

43
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,303
and Calvin

44
00:02:05,303 --> 00:02:06,136
- So cute.

45
00:02:06,136 --> 00:02:07,616
- [Jared] is ready for his.

46
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:09,205
- Do you want to be a dog?

47
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:10,038
- No.

48
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:10,871
- What?

49
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:11,704
- What, you just said you did.

50
00:02:11,704 --> 00:02:13,474
Come on, do you want
to be in your costume?

51
00:02:13,474 --> 00:02:15,349
- I'm gonna shoot webs.

52
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:16,182
- Don't shoot me with webs,

53
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:18,302
I need to film and I have my arms to film

54
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:21,310
and if you shoot me with
webs, I can't do it.

55
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,946
- You charged them, it worked.

56
00:02:23,946 --> 00:02:25,337
- [Jared] Wait, give it a second.

57
00:02:25,337 --> 00:02:27,407
(Calvin crying)

58
00:02:27,407 --> 00:02:29,273
You want it off?

59
00:02:29,273 --> 00:02:30,106
- Yes.

60
00:02:30,106 --> 00:02:32,332
- Awww, sorry Mom.
- He doesn't like it.

61
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:33,846
- Calvin doesn't want to
wear the costume either.

62
00:02:33,846 --> 00:02:35,078
- What are you gonna wear?

63
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:35,911
- No!

64
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,563
- Maybe none at all?

65
00:02:38,563 --> 00:02:41,386
- Which is so sad, because this

66
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,938
is the costume that you wanted to wear.

67
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:44,771
It's kind of a bummer.

68
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:46,537
- Look, Mommy's gonna be a dog, look.

69
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:48,282
(panting)

70
00:02:48,282 --> 00:02:50,865
- No.
(barking)

71
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,707
- You want to wear it?

72
00:02:52,707 --> 00:02:53,540
- No.

73
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,260
(panting)

74
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,427
(barking)

75
00:03:02,203 --> 00:03:03,377
- Do you want to try it?

76
00:03:03,377 --> 00:03:04,210
- No.

77
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,404
(Jared laughs)

78
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:06,553
- You're a pill.

79
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,769
You know, that's what you have to do

80
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:10,056
if you want candy, is
you put on the costume

81
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:10,968
and you go door to door,

82
00:03:10,968 --> 00:03:12,609
and you say I want candy, trick or treat,

83
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,608
and that's how you get candy,

84
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:14,720
but you can't do it without the costume,

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,459
the costume is the most important part

86
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,207
other than the day.

87
00:03:19,207 --> 00:03:21,119
If you don't have a costume
and you say trick or treat,

88
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,296
people are like what are you doing.

89
00:03:22,296 --> 00:03:24,724
- When I put my costume on,

90
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:26,614
I get trick or treat.

91
00:03:26,614 --> 00:03:27,447
- That's right.

92
00:03:27,447 --> 00:03:28,787
See Jackson's got it.

93
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:31,724
- Tonight, I got tickets, we're gonna go

94
00:03:31,724 --> 00:03:34,914
to a Dino Park and they have
some activities for kids there.

95
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:36,489
- [Jared] Ooh, Dinosaur Park.

96
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:37,322
- Okay well I'm bummed..

97
00:03:37,322 --> 00:03:38,155
- [Jared] Sorry.

98
00:03:38,155 --> 00:03:39,580
- Mommy.

99
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,413
Mommy.

100
00:03:40,413 --> 00:03:41,412
- Where's Mommy?
- Which one's Mommy?

101
00:03:41,412 --> 00:03:42,245
- There's Mommy.

102
00:03:42,245 --> 00:03:43,246
- [Jared] That's right.

103
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:45,526
- [Ellie] Is that Mommy?

104
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:46,734
- That's Mommy.

105
00:03:46,734 --> 00:03:47,821
- Where's
- No, that's Mommy.

106
00:03:47,821 --> 00:03:50,295
- [Ellie] Where's Aunt Bonnie?

107
00:03:50,295 --> 00:03:51,795
Where's Aunt Ruby?

108
00:03:53,003 --> 00:03:54,464
- [Jared] Yeah, good job.

109
00:03:54,464 --> 00:03:56,847
- [Ellie] Where's Aunt Julie?

110
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:59,716
- Good job, that's so good.
- Good job.

111
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,883
- Now put your costume on.

112
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,239
Sweet, we may have found some.

113
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:06,920
Woo!

114
00:04:08,504 --> 00:04:10,716
Do you want to be a tomato Jacks?

115
00:04:10,716 --> 00:04:13,460
Or do you want to stick with Spiderman.

116
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,293
- [Jackson] Spiderman.

117
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:16,259
- [Ellie] Okay, that might work.

118
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:18,029
- [Jared] Okay, go fast,
he oh he took it off.

119
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,781
- [Ellie] This might get us by.

120
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,575
- We made the long trek down

121
00:04:21,576 --> 00:04:23,632
to prehistoric times.

122
00:04:23,632 --> 00:04:26,335
We're gonna see some what, Jackson?

123
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,848
- Dinosaurs.

124
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:31,269
- Dinosaurs, look and we
can see through the fence.

125
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:33,046
And we can see one right there.

126
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,963
Does that look so cool?

127
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,284
Not just dinosaurs,

128
00:04:38,284 --> 00:04:39,117
(car honks)

129
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:40,172
but some Halloween activities too.

130
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:43,339
Ooh oh look, there's a goose or a swan

131
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:46,625
and some ducks.

132
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,576
More than just dinosaurs too, huh.

133
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:49,664
- There's the park over there.

134
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,497
- [Jared] Yeah.

135
00:04:50,497 --> 00:04:51,497
- We've been waiting in line

136
00:04:51,497 --> 00:04:53,161
and as soon as they let us in,

137
00:04:53,161 --> 00:04:56,828
Jackson frantically,
Calvin Calvin, come on,

138
00:04:57,913 --> 00:05:02,346
and he was waiting, making
sure Calvin was by him.

139
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:04,119
What did you say to him?

140
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:04,969
- Trick or roar.

141
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:06,481
- [Ellie] Trick or roar.

142
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:07,314
- Trick or roar.

143
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:09,640
- [Ellie] I'm glad he did it.

144
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,590
- Just grab one.
- Just grab one.

145
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,423
- [Ellie] Perfect.

146
00:05:11,423 --> 00:05:13,724
- So guys like Spiderman
and Captain Ameica

147
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:17,481
might be super strong, but
T Rex is pretty tough too

148
00:05:17,481 --> 00:05:19,587
in some ways, you might not think.

149
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:20,523
His head was tough,

150
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,555
but each of those arms that everyone likes

151
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,288
to talk about how small they were,

152
00:05:24,288 --> 00:05:27,524
each of those arms could
lift about 400 pounds.

153
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:31,691
- [Jared] Oh my gosh, he's
almost as strong as Dad.

154
00:05:33,026 --> 00:05:34,359
- Trick or roar.

155
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:37,896
- [Man] Trick or roar.

156
00:05:37,896 --> 00:05:39,797
- [Ellie] I'm glad that he says it.

157
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,472
- Those glasses are kinda crazy.

158
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,201
I'm just laughing at this bear.

159
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:45,195
Ask him which dinosaur this is?

160
00:05:45,195 --> 00:05:46,837
- What one?
- Do you know it?

161
00:05:46,837 --> 00:05:49,160
- This one's called an Acrocanthosaurus.

162
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,296
- What?
- It's an Acrocanthosaurus.

163
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,406
- [Jared] Oh my goodness.

164
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:52,657
- Why's that spider here?

165
00:05:52,657 --> 00:05:53,490
- [Man] The spider?

166
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,728
- [Ellie] Yeah, there's a spider.

167
00:05:55,728 --> 00:05:58,472
- [Jared] He's like that
one's more colorful.

168
00:05:58,472 --> 00:05:59,965
- Trick or roar, trick or roar, trick or

169
00:05:59,965 --> 00:06:01,815
trick or trick or roar.

170
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:02,813
- [Jared] This is an interesting dinosaur,

171
00:06:02,813 --> 00:06:04,744
I've never seen this kind before.

172
00:06:04,744 --> 00:06:07,006
Have you ever seen that kind of dinosaur?

173
00:06:07,006 --> 00:06:08,719
It's kinda weird, huh.

174
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:11,327
- Look at that green dinosaur right there.

175
00:06:11,327 --> 00:06:12,555
- Whoa.

176
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:14,393
I know we've given the
Tyrannosaurus rex some grief

177
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:16,084
for having just little tiny arms,

178
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,005
but T Rex, don't worry,

179
00:06:17,005 --> 00:06:18,286
I've got your back covered, okay?

180
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:20,057
- This is something else.

181
00:06:20,057 --> 00:06:21,240
- [Jared] This is something else.

182
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,268
So here's the dinosaur,

183
00:06:22,268 --> 00:06:23,206
and you're probably thinking,

184
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,754
like where are his arms?

185
00:06:24,754 --> 00:06:25,980
Like where are they?

186
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,063
Oh, they're just so tiny.

187
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:33,458
They're so tiny, why are they so tiny?

188
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:34,291
- [Ellie] But its feet are huge.

189
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,262

190
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,209
Oh there we go.

191
00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:38,963
- [Ellie] And its legs, look at 'em.

192
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:40,437

194
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,984

195
00:06:58,435 --> 00:06:59,819
Oh yeah, gotta put your

196
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,878

Come here, Cal.

250
00:09:34,013 --> 00:09:35,422
These guys have an owl.

251
00:09:35,422 --> 00:09:37,029
Do you know what owl's say?

252
00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:38,964
They say hoo hoo.

253
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,881
Do you see that Calvin?

254
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,718
Do you see that owl?

255
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:47,430
Did you ever dissect
owl poop in sixth grade?

256
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,263
- No.

257
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:49,096
- [Jared] We totally did.

258
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:49,929
- Tell me about it.

259
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,935
- Well so we would have owl poops

260
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:54,692
and we put gloves on and used tools

261
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:57,012
and we'd find like mice bones
and all of that kind of stuff.

262
00:09:57,012 --> 00:10:00,353
- Oh you know what, I think we did.

263
00:10:00,353 --> 00:10:03,500
- [Jared] Calvin look,

264
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,375

265
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:07,558
Welcome to the club, welcome to the club,

266
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:10,853
welcome to the club, where
I'm sitting with my bud.

267
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:12,245
Penny are you my bud tonight?

268
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,177
No you can't have the keyboard,

269
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:14,634
you can't bite the keyboard.

270
00:10:14,634 --> 00:10:16,474
Seriously this is the club.

271
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:19,891
I've got one two three four five screens,

272
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,709
but only two of them are going right now.

273
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:25,158
I am working on three videos right now,

274
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,852
one of which is going on Ellie's channel,

275
00:10:26,852 --> 00:10:27,917
but to give her credit,

276
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:29,161
she's the one that actually edited it.

277
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,259
I'm doing the thumbnail
and the upload right now.

278
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,054
I've got a vlog that's going up tomorrow,

279
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:34,565
and then I'm actually going to be

280

00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:42,832

So I want to give you a little heads up.

00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,382
What are you guys doing over there?

287
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,397
- I was trying to get a picture.

288
00:10:53,397 --> 00:10:55,077
- You're trying to get a picture with her?

289
00:10:55,077 --> 00:10:55,910
That's cute.

290
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,324
Penny has been so fun in the office,

291
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,189

292
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,144
We come in here at the end of the night,

293
00:11:01,144 --> 00:11:01,985
and we both sit here,

294
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,013
she chews on that little rabbit.

295
00:11:04,013 --> 00:11:05,236
But I just wanted to show you

296
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:07,055

297
00:11:07,055 --> 00:11:08,758
Ellie's in the comfy leather chair.

298
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:09,670
Is it comfy?

299
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,503
- It is comfy.

300
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,302
- [Jared] because it's definitely leather.

301
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:13,525
- It's cute and little.

302
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:14,608
- That's it from us tonight.

303
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:15,512
Thanks for watching Brooklyn.

304
00:11:15,512 --> 00:11:17,613
I hope you guys have a
wonderful wonderful weekend,

305
00:11:17,613 --> 00:11:19,381
