1
00:00:00,302 --> 00:00:01,515
- It's a snow day.
(bright music)

2
00:00:01,515 --> 00:00:03,601
- It was like pulling teeth.

3
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:04,874
Good news, we're on our way

4
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:06,413
to the ultrasound right now.

5
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:07,581
- I'm a little nervous, getting ready

6
00:00:07,581 --> 00:00:09,837
for our second ultrasound,

7
00:00:09,837 --> 00:00:11,905
my 10 week ultrasound.

8
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:13,115
- [Jared] Where's the baby?

9
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:14,480
Yeah.

10
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,313
That's the baby.

11
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:17,549
(jingling bells)

12
00:00:17,549 --> 00:00:18,487
- [Ellie] Good morning.

13
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:20,161
- Good morning.

14
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,588
- [Ellie] Jackson's waiting by the door,

15
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:24,171
because guys, look at the snow.

16
00:00:28,077 --> 00:00:31,309
We are going to play in that today.

17
00:00:31,309 --> 00:00:33,713
I told the kids as soon as mom eats,

18
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:36,585
we can go outside and play.

19
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:38,114
I gotta go in the garage and see

20
00:00:38,114 --> 00:00:40,647
if we have like a snow sled.

21
00:00:40,647 --> 00:00:42,051
- [Jackson] The snow thrower.

22
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,268
- The snow thrower?

23
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:44,285
- [Jackson] Uh-huh.

24
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:45,845
- You remember that from last year?

25
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:46,739
- Uh-huh.

26
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,262
- To be honest, I think Penny may have

27
00:00:49,262 --> 00:00:51,389
got to it last year.

28
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:53,021
We may have to get a new one.

29
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:54,021
- Abra-caaaa

30
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:01,663
cabbage!

31
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:04,881
(Ellie laughs)

32
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:05,970
- [Ellie] I don't know what they're doing,

33
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,203
but every time Jackson does that,

34
00:01:08,203 --> 00:01:10,453
he pulls the funniest face.

35
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:13,973
- abraca

36
00:01:17,582 --> 00:01:18,415
dabra!

37
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,296
- It's officially time.

38
00:01:21,296 --> 00:01:24,400
It's time to hook up the
plow to the four-wheeler,

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,964
so we can pow the driveway!

40
00:01:26,964 --> 00:01:28,078
I love having a plow,

41
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,631
because I can plow my driveway so fast,

42
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,884
instead of shoveling and breaking my back,

43
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:32,987
but I can also help other people

44
00:01:32,987 --> 00:01:33,820
with their driveways.

45
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,111
That's the coolest part about it.

46
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,248
I can zoom through mine,
and help other people,

47
00:01:37,248 --> 00:01:38,902
help the church, do all those things,

48
00:01:38,902 --> 00:01:41,081
help the people who
are in our neighborhood

49
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:41,914
who are older, all of that.

50
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:43,115
I love it very much.

51
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,720
The coolest thing about this,

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,258
is how quick it is to set up.

53
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,296
There's literally three
things that I have to do.

54
00:01:48,296 --> 00:01:49,256
The hardest part about this

55
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:51,272
is lifting this heavy son of a gun

56
00:01:51,272 --> 00:01:53,679
all the way back from over there,

57
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:54,512
over here.

58
00:01:54,512 --> 00:01:55,789
It's like 200 pounds, I don't know,

59
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,757
it's probably not that much,

60
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:59,442
I'm just exaggerating
maybe just a little bit,

61
00:01:59,442 --> 00:02:01,154
but it's heavy, brought it over,

62
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,434
hooked it up to the winch,

63
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:03,970
now I've just got to
attach it to the frame

64
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,090
and we're set to go.

65
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,923
That easy.

66
00:02:05,923 --> 00:02:06,756
Let's plow.

67
00:02:06,756 --> 00:02:09,756
Alright, let's see if I can do this.

68
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,201
(metal clanking)

69
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,618
So this side is in between the two slots,

70
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:25,312
but that side is not,

71
00:02:26,306 --> 00:02:27,625
it's hitting the edge,

72
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,724
so I've got to figure
out how to figure to bend

73
00:02:29,724 --> 00:02:33,322
it a little bit, to get it both inside.

74
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:35,085
This might be more
difficult than I thought.

75
00:02:35,085 --> 00:02:35,918
I cut my finger,

76
00:02:35,918 --> 00:02:37,563
not as bad as I thought it was though.

77
00:02:37,563 --> 00:02:38,915
- [Ellie] Hi Jare.

78
00:02:38,915 --> 00:02:40,477
- [Jared] Hi.

79
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,037
- Looking good.

80
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,172
It's a snow day.

81
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:45,539
(bright jingly music)

82
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,372
- I see.

83
00:02:48,999 --> 00:02:51,249
(laughing)

84
00:02:54,853 --> 00:02:56,510
(Ellie laughs)

85
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,105
- Yay.

86
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:00,355
(laughing)

87
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,027
- [Ellie] Is that fun.

88
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:05,929
- [Jackson] No I'm gonna do it again.

89
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:08,679
- [Ellie] Okay, I'll do it again.

90
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:12,466
Your caboose fell off.

91
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:14,968
Your rider fell off.

92
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,721
Hey, I don't think he's gonna tip you.

93
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:19,828
(Ellie laughs)

94
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,911
You took off without him.

95
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,213
- No.

96
00:03:27,797 --> 00:03:30,153
(howling)

97
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:32,092
- [Ellie] Did you guys have fun?

98
00:03:32,092 --> 00:03:32,925
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

99
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:36,327
- [Ellie] You mister are the
one that broke the party up

100
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:38,470
and wanted to come inside.

101
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,827
Were you cold?

102
00:03:39,827 --> 00:03:40,660
- Yeah.

103
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,493
- [Ellie] A little.

104
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:42,951
So we got some hot chocolate going on.

105
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:45,264
- It was like pulling teeth,

106
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:46,568
it was so difficult.

107
00:03:46,568 --> 00:03:47,401
So what happened,

108
00:03:47,401 --> 00:03:48,234
I finally got it, by the way,

109
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:51,310
the plow is on, ready to rock and roll.

110
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,677
We're ready to plow some snow,

111
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,467
but here's what happened.

112
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:57,107
I couldn't get both parts into the mount

113
00:03:57,107 --> 00:03:59,195
on the underside of the four-wheeler

114
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:01,148
because Joel and I reinforced it.

115
00:04:01,148 --> 00:04:03,503
We vlogged about it a
long time ago last year.

116
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:07,954
We welded the pieces so
they would be reinforced,

117
00:04:07,954 --> 00:04:11,403
and that actually pulled
one of the bars like that.

118
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,565
So it wouldn't fit inside of it,

119
00:04:12,565 --> 00:04:15,698
so I literally had to jerry-rig it

120
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,814
to get back to position.

121
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:19,197
And I finally got it.

122
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:22,229
Now it's back in place,
here's the sad part.

123
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,530
My battery's died.

124
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,609
(laughs)

125
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:26,429
I am such an idiot guys.

126
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:29,781
I literally left the battery on,

127
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:30,829
it wasn't running,

128
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:34,759
but the battery was on from last night.

129
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,647
(sighs)

130
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:39,471
So luckily, I have this guy right here.

131
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:42,138
This has saved me twice before

132
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:43,779
when my battery has died.

133
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:46,887
And so we're getting it
going through right now.

134
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,697
And it is just charging up the battery.

135
00:04:48,697 --> 00:04:50,190
This is a portable battery

136
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,983
and I keep it in my bag wherever we go,

137
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,992
because we've had
four-wheelers die on us before.

138
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,351
It sucks to have your four-wheeler die

139
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:56,991
when you're out in the middle of nowhere,

140
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,162
because then you have to tow someone

141
00:04:58,162 --> 00:04:59,146
the whole way back.

142
00:04:59,146 --> 00:05:00,354
But when you have the battery,

143
00:05:00,354 --> 00:05:01,755
you're all set to go.

144
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:04,845
- I'm kind of to the
point in my kids' sizing,

145
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,050
that I just don't care anymore.

146
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,649
I just put pants on Calvin

147
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,166
and I was like oh those are Jackson's,

148
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,942
mm, we'll just leave 'em on.

149
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:16,008
They fit enough.

150
00:05:16,008 --> 00:05:18,248
Yeah and sometimes you wear his.

151
00:05:18,248 --> 00:05:19,845
And it's like so close in sizing

152
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:21,706
it really doesn't even matter.

153
00:05:21,706 --> 00:05:23,076
But we've gotta get
their socks and shoes on,

154
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:24,332
so we can go.

155
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:25,668
You okay?

156
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,129
You got a little cough.

157
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,909
Uh-uh, excuse me.

158
00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:30,512
- Uh-uh, boo tail.

159
00:05:30,512 --> 00:05:31,345
- Bad news and good news.

160
00:05:31,345 --> 00:05:33,824
Bad news is I couldn't get
the four-wheeler to start.

161
00:05:33,824 --> 00:05:35,365
I'm trickle charging it right now.

162
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:36,637
Good news, we're on our way

163
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,245
to the ultrasound right now.

164
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:39,765
Our next ultrasound.

165
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:43,540
- [Ellie] Just getting
a show on for the boys.

166
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,373
- Story.

167
00:05:45,248 --> 00:05:47,374
- To entertain you.

168
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:48,207
I'm a little nervous,

169
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,873
getting ready for our second ultrasound,

170
00:05:50,873 --> 00:05:52,574
my 10 week ultrasound.

171
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,902
Our ultrasound looked
really good at seven weeks,

172
00:05:55,902 --> 00:05:57,400
but we're still really,

173
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,956
I think that feeling just
won't leave for a minute, but--

174
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,317
- [Jared] I don't think
it'll ever leave us.

175
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:03,681
- But I am excited.

176
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,706
I'm excited to see my doctor,

177
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:06,369
because we didn't see him
at the seven week, so,

178
00:06:06,369 --> 00:06:07,792
and he's always nice.

179
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:10,072
- Oh my gosh.
- Do you see that?

180
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:11,665
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh (laughs).

181
00:06:11,665 --> 00:06:12,603
That's crazy.

182
00:06:12,603 --> 00:06:13,554
- [Jared] It's like bumpin'.

183
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:14,926
- [Doctor] A good sight.

184
00:06:14,926 --> 00:06:17,221
- It's the baby.
- Yeah.

185
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:18,881
- [Calvin] Yeah, the baby.

186
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:21,159
- Aw that's cute.
- Listen, guys listen.

187
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:23,803
(heartbeat)

188
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,636
- [Ellie] That's cute.

189
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:29,378
- [Jared] Oh my heck.

190
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,628
- [Doctor] He's moving now.

191
00:06:33,571 --> 00:06:34,933
That's a good rhythm.

192
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:36,424
- [Jared] Did you hear that boys?

193
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:37,606
- [Jackson] What is is?

194
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,439
- [Jared] That's the baby's heartbeat.

195
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,739
- [Doctor] 161 beats a
minute, so that's good.

196
00:06:42,739 --> 00:06:45,660
- [Ellie] That's so
cute, that it is jumping.

197
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,021
- [Jared] I know, do you
see him jumping, her, him?

198
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,602
- [Ellie] That's cute.

199
00:06:50,602 --> 00:06:52,141
- [Doctor] Okay, let's get a measurement.

200
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:52,974
- [Ellie] Okay.

201
00:06:52,974 --> 00:06:54,644
- [Doctor] So if you extrapolate that,

202
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:58,104
if the baby's already two days ahead,

203
00:06:58,104 --> 00:07:00,683
then it'll be like 17 pounds

204
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:01,516
when he's born.

205
00:07:01,516 --> 00:07:03,432
(laughing)

206
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,294
- [Jared] Good luck with that Ellie.

207
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,714
Good luck with that.
- That's a mean thing to say.

208
00:07:07,714 --> 00:07:08,547
- [Doctor] No, that's the whole works.

209
00:07:08,547 --> 00:07:10,272
- [Ellie] That's such a cute image.

210
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:12,497
- Oh my gosh.
- There's your little legs.

211
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:13,733
- [Ellie] Is that that
little hand up there?

212
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:14,566
- [Doctor] Yep.

213
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:16,174
- [Ellie] That's the cutest thing.

214
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:18,188
- So this right, is his head.

215
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,450
- Head.
- Look at his feet.

216
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,559
- [Doctor] Hand, arm, leg.

217
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,606
- Oh my goodness, Ellie.
- Oh my gosh.

218
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:24,580
- But it looks great,

219
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,698
because we're looking not only,

220
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:27,916
all the baby's anatomy looks good.

221
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:28,749
That looks great.

222
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:29,813
- [Jackson] The heartbeat was really,

223
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:31,413
I didn't like the heartbeat.

224
00:07:31,413 --> 00:07:33,531
- [Jared] It sounds a
little different, huh?

225
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:35,997
- Oh my goodness.
- That's so cute.

226
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:36,902
(laughing)

227
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:37,911
- [Jared] Calvin baby.

228
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,551
- [Ellie] Where's that
stuff I always take?

229
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,691
- [Jared] Where's the baby?

230
00:07:40,691 --> 00:07:42,524
Yeah, that's the baby.

231
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,453
- Oh my gosh!

232
00:07:44,453 --> 00:07:45,844
- Turn the car on, let's go.

233
00:07:45,844 --> 00:07:47,284
(clapping)

234
00:07:47,284 --> 00:07:48,117
- Ellie.

235
00:07:49,473 --> 00:07:52,294
- It was so wiggly.
- It's our baby!

236
00:07:52,294 --> 00:07:53,752
- Oh did you see it jumping?

237
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,725
- Yes, it like had the hiccups.

238
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,388
- I know.

239
00:07:57,388 --> 00:07:59,580
We saw our baby today and the heartbeat

240
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,155
and everything.
- And

241
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:04,259
- his little hand was waving.

242
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:05,294
So cute.

243
00:08:05,294 --> 00:08:06,127
- Or her.

244
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,489
- Well it's easier to say
his, right, than his or her.

245
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,523
- I know exactly what you mean.

246
00:08:09,523 --> 00:08:11,169
- I'll just call him him until we know.

247
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:12,172
- Until we know for sure

248
00:08:12,172 --> 00:08:14,244
it's our baby girl,
- It's just easy.

249
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,468
- Holy cow.
- It's a baby girl?

250
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,581
- We don't know yet.

251
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,125
We're gonna find out soon though.

252
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,824
- Oh my goodness.

253
00:08:20,824 --> 00:08:22,836
- That that oh my.

254
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,838
- I am

255
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:26,291
I am, I can, I'm very happy.

256
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,916
- Oh my gosh.
- I don't know what to say.

257
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:31,473
- Just seeing
- It's such a relief.

258
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:33,183
- the shape of the baby,

259
00:08:33,183 --> 00:08:35,687
the heartbeat, it's moving.

260
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,236
It was almost like

261
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:38,819
it was extra active

262
00:08:40,294 --> 00:08:41,813
for us to see
- I know.

263
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:46,154
and just to make us feel
good and calm our nerves.

264
00:08:46,154 --> 00:08:47,602
- Before even the heartbeat, it's like,

265
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,440
oh, the baby's moving.

266
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,438
And so are you guys.
- And the camera's fallin'.

267
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,284
- The baby was wiggling
before even the heartbeat,

268
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:54,799
which was so cute.

269
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,299
- Dad, when we get home. can I throw some,

270
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:01,897
can I get the snow thrower

271
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,254
and throw some snow balls please?

272
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:06,251
- [Jared] Absolutely you can.

273
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,270
- Yes!

274
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,721
(laughing)

275
00:09:08,721 --> 00:09:10,460
- After Mommy gets some food.

276
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,574
- Yes we gotta get some food.
- He's like how are you doing,

277
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,459
are you keeping food down,

278
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:15,531
I'm like, oh yeah, plenty, eating lots.

279
00:09:15,531 --> 00:09:18,149
I told Jared I swear when I saw

280
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,877
the baby move, I could feel it.

281
00:09:19,877 --> 00:09:22,493
I know I couldn't,
- I don't want to order.

282
00:09:22,493 --> 00:09:24,793
but in a way I felt it.
- I don't want to order.

283
00:09:24,793 --> 00:09:26,491
- It was the weirdest thing seeing

284
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:27,541
- [Jackson] I don't want
to go in the drive-through.

285
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,179
- our baby is healthy and strong

286
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:31,846
and I am so excited.

287
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,948
Oh my gosh.

288
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,891
Is there another word to say

289
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,370
other than I'm excited all the time?

290
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,667
- [Jared] You're ecstatic?

291
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,500
- I'm just so happy.

292
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,104
- [Jared] This is stupendous?

293
00:09:41,104 --> 00:09:42,837
- The kids are so cute.

294
00:09:42,837 --> 00:09:45,037
Calvin, are you excited?

295
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:45,908
- Yeah.

296
00:09:45,908 --> 00:09:48,138
- Hearing the kids be like, the baby.

297
00:09:48,138 --> 00:09:48,971
It's so fun.

298
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:50,186
- Yes, finally.

299
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,235
(four-wheeler humming)
(Jared laughs)

300
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,230
It finally started.

301
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,828
I have been charging
this thing all day long

302
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,477
and I finally got it done.

303
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:02,347
I can finally plow the driveway.

304
00:10:02,347 --> 00:10:03,831
I know, you're probably thinking,

305
00:10:03,831 --> 00:10:06,078
Jared, you could've
done this by hand maybe,

306
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:08,062
I don't know, 10 hours ago?

307
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,118
I did some of it, so we
could get in and out.

308
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:12,815
It's the principal of the matter.

309
00:10:12,815 --> 00:10:14,285
It's the principal, I
had to get it started,

310
00:10:14,285 --> 00:10:17,482
so I could use the plow for
the first time this season.

311
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,996
I had to do it.

312
00:10:18,996 --> 00:10:21,246
Okay, let's plow some snow.

313
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,522
You'd think with how much the kids played

314
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:32,482
in the snow today, that they would go down

315
00:10:32,482 --> 00:10:33,427
for bed very easily.

316
00:10:33,427 --> 00:10:35,146
Jackson actually did,

317
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,001
but Calvin on the other hand.

318
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:37,897
- Story of our life.

319
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:40,834
Calvin, I can't wait for
my bump to get bigger,

320
00:10:40,834 --> 00:10:43,042
so he stops thinking that the baby

321
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:43,875
is in my boobs.

322
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:44,708
(Jared laughs)

323
00:10:44,708 --> 00:10:46,212
He's like, I see baby.

324
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,908
All day, after the appointment,

325
00:10:47,908 --> 00:10:50,556
he has been, I see baby.

326
00:10:50,556 --> 00:10:51,904
And I say the baby's in my tummy,

327
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:52,842
it has to grow a long time.

328
00:10:52,842 --> 00:10:54,925
Oh Okay, I see Mama baby.

329
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,258
So cute.
- That's so cute.

330
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,866
- He's been so cute.

331
00:11:00,866 --> 00:11:03,042
- Both of the boys have been very sweet

332
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:04,303
about this whole thing.
- Yeah.

333
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,573
It's been so cute.

334
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:07,588
So now that the appointment has done,

335
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:09,009
how are you feeling?

336
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:10,040
- I feel so good.

337
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,094
That was such a good feeling.

338
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:12,927
That was such a good feeling.

339
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:15,912
And my doctor makes me feel so good.

340
00:11:15,912 --> 00:11:18,667
I was like, I don't know why,

341
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:22,142
so usually you only get two ultrasounds

342
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:23,372
to see the baby,

343
00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,691
and that's because of insurance reasons,

344
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:28,539
and I was like, I'm happy
to pay for ultrasounds.

345
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:31,988
I don't think I can not
come and see the baby.

346
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,042
And he was just like, you know,

347
00:11:34,042 --> 00:11:35,901
he goes, we'll work around it.

348
00:11:35,901 --> 00:11:38,173
And I said no, I'm happy to pay for it.

349
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:40,996
And he goes okay, we'll
just let the nurses know

350
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,503
to make sure to have
the machine in the room

351
00:11:42,503 --> 00:11:43,336
and we can do that.

352
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:46,390
And I'm like, you are so good to me.

353
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,003
Just so nice,
- I know.

354
00:11:48,003 --> 00:11:50,007
- and never makes me feel bad or dumb

355
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,801
or anything like, he's just--

356
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:53,071
- [Jared] Considerate.

357
00:11:53,071 --> 00:11:54,675
- It helps to have a really nice doctor.

358
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,210
- Yeah, and my first thought was like

359
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,051
well how much was an ultrasound machine

360
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,528
to have in our house?

361
00:11:59,528 --> 00:12:01,962
I know Bryan and Missy
had the heart monitor.

362
00:12:01,962 --> 00:12:02,795
- [Ellie] Yeah.

363
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:04,137
- Maybe we should get
one of those sometime.

364
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:05,253
I think it would be fun to do that,

365
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:06,644
I don't know.
- Yeah.

366
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:07,752
- [Jared] Do you remember when we did it

367
00:12:07,752 --> 00:12:09,449
at Bryan and Missy's house.
- That was fun.

368
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:10,282
- [Jared] Yeah.

369
00:12:10,282 --> 00:12:12,529
- I love love love love

370
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:13,865
that today went well.

371
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,857
We were very nervous

372
00:12:15,857 --> 00:12:19,449
and I think that it was just
a very good reaffirming,

373
00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:22,210
like okay now I am 10 weeks
and things really do look good.

374
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,446
The baby was huge.

375
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:24,711
- Yeah.

376
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:26,568
Well it was so funny,
he's like well if things

377
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,082
keep progressing the way they are,

378
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,857
this baby's gonna be 17 pounds.

379
00:12:29,857 --> 00:12:31,562
- I was like no.

380
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,006
- [Jared] No!

381
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:34,428
- Yeah the baby grew so much,

382
00:12:34,428 --> 00:12:37,560
it's crazy how fast just in a few weeks.

383
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,511
And in a few more weeks,
how the baby will look.

384
00:12:39,511 --> 00:12:42,011
I saw his feet, and his hands.

385
00:12:43,223 --> 00:12:45,279
- I know, we saw our baby.

386
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,284
- [Ellie] It was so fun.

387
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:47,829
- How magical is that?

388
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:48,662
How cool is that?

389
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:50,745
And, not only that,

390
00:12:50,745 --> 00:12:52,619
I got my four-wheeler started today.

391
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:53,452
- Yay.

392
00:12:53,452 --> 00:12:54,285
(laughing)

393
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:55,379
Our morning was a little cranky.

394
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:57,416
He didn't like that it
wouldn't work for him.

395
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,891
- Oh it was tough, I mean I spent hours.

396
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:02,455
And I have so much stuff do to,

397
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:04,448
(sighs) but I'm tired.

398
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:06,290
- Crap happens.
(laugh-crying)

399
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,650
- Yeah, but it was just a wonderful day.

400
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,581
Like I can't think of a better way--

401
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:13,164
- My hand's on my stomach,

402
00:13:13,164 --> 00:13:15,259
'cause I don't feel well.

403
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:16,134
- Aww.

404
00:13:16,134 --> 00:13:17,126
I can't think of a better way

405
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:20,238
to have that solidification,

406
00:13:20,238 --> 00:13:22,560
that reassuring phew thing

407
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,444
going to that appointment today.

408
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,083
It was so nice.

409
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,994
But we're gonna call it a night.

410
00:13:26,994 --> 00:13:30,109
We wanna let you know that
merch is still available.

411
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,773
Our holiday merch is still available

412
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,534
and if you do expedited shipping,

413
00:13:33,534 --> 00:13:34,878
you will get it before Christmas,

414
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,014
so check it out.

415
00:13:36,014 --> 00:13:37,224
I'll have a link to it down below.

416
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:38,345
It's going to be awesome.

417
00:13:38,345 --> 00:13:40,583
Ours is in the mail, it
should be here this week.

418
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,247
- I know, I was mad that
we haven't got it yet.

419
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:45,497
- I know, I know, it's coming, I promise.

420
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:46,593
If you guys have some,

421
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,094
be sure to send us Twitter pictures,

422
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,968
Instagram photos, tag
us on all of that stuff,

423
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:53,617
so we can see you guys
sporting the holiday merch.

424
00:13:53,617 --> 00:13:54,657
But that is it from us.

425
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:56,182
We are going to call it a night.

426
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:58,204
I have an early morning tomorrow.

427
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,037
Thanks so much for watching

428
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,603
and we will see you tomorrow.

429
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:01,436
- Bye.

430
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:02,424
- Goodnight baby.

431
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,792
- Bye.

432
00:14:03,792 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
