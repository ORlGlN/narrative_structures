1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:01,684
(playful spooky music)

2
00:00:01,684 --> 00:00:03,448
(digital beeps)

3
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:05,802
- And here's a Mario.

4
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:06,747
(laughing)

5
00:00:06,747 --> 00:00:07,683
- [Jared] We've got a fog machine

6
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:09,254
and we don't know if this is good or bad.

7
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:11,404
Oh look, he's wearing it Ellie.

8
00:00:11,404 --> 00:00:12,972
- I got rid of Bowser.

9
00:00:12,972 --> 00:00:14,065
- Give me a kiss.

10
00:00:14,065 --> 00:00:14,898
Oh!

11
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:25,835
- There they are.

12
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,964
I'm gathering Jackson's
costume up this morning

13
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:29,683
for his pre-school party.

14
00:00:29,683 --> 00:00:31,774
And the kids have been waking up

15
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:33,603
and wanting to keep the lights off

16
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,901
when they eat breakfast,

17
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:37,077
and I think it's the cutest thing.

18
00:00:37,077 --> 00:00:39,901
They were cold, so they
were sitting on the heater

19
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,901
and now, we turned the fireplace on.

20
00:00:44,012 --> 00:00:45,118
Is that fun?

21
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:46,092
- Yeah.

22
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:47,388
- [Ellie] Wow.

23
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:48,221
So we're eating breakfast.

24
00:00:48,221 --> 00:00:50,292
- You know what I'm going to this week?

25
00:00:50,292 --> 00:00:51,497
- [Ellie] What?

26
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:52,330
- School party.

27
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,124
- [Ellie] A school party.

28
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:55,207
Cool Jackson.

29
00:00:56,046 --> 00:00:58,063
Oh it's starting to warm up.

30
00:00:58,063 --> 00:01:00,655
- I'm gonna put my glove on real quick.

31
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:02,793
- Okay, hey Jackson.

32
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:04,065
- I didn't mean to hit you.

33
00:01:04,065 --> 00:01:05,065
- It's okay.

34
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:08,611
Jackson, he has a hard time

35
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,489
wearing clothes under his outfit,

36
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,345
but it's cold outside.

37
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,621
So if we just wear your pajamas

38
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:16,996
that are really thin.

39
00:01:16,996 --> 00:01:17,829
Waa!

40
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:18,662
Come here.

41
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,029
- [Jackson] I need to
get the other glove on.

42
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:22,056
- Okay, do it right here.

43
00:01:22,056 --> 00:01:22,889
Okay.

44
00:01:25,774 --> 00:01:27,387
Oh thank you so much.

45
00:01:27,387 --> 00:01:28,554
- Ha ha ha ha.

46
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:30,511
- Ah ha!

47
00:01:31,412 --> 00:01:32,683
- Come here.

48
00:01:32,683 --> 00:01:36,100
You look good.
(growling)

49
00:01:38,196 --> 00:01:40,779
(gentle music)

50
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,880
Does it look okay?

51
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:52,652
- Yeah.

52
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:54,478
- [Ellie] Oh good.

53
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:55,433
I was gonna say we should do your hair,

54
00:01:55,433 --> 00:01:57,872
but I guess we don't really need to.

55
00:01:57,872 --> 00:01:58,705
- Nope.

56
00:01:58,705 --> 00:01:59,696
(Ellie laughs)

57
00:01:59,696 --> 00:02:01,522
- [Ellie] Let's at least
go brush your teeth.

58
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,762
- Like this.

59
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:05,845
- [Ellie] Oh good, oh can I kiss you?

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,115
Woo!

61
00:02:08,115 --> 00:02:09,586
- [Jared] Oh my goodness,
you got some sweet loot

62
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:11,382
from pre-school, huh?

63
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:12,569
- That's sour worms.

64
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,327
- [Ellie] Jackson tell
me about pre-school.

65
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,672
- I've been at pre-school
and I cleaned up.

66
00:02:17,672 --> 00:02:19,653
- [Ellie] You cleaned up?

67
00:02:19,653 --> 00:02:22,903
- I ate snacks and I didn't go outside.

68
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:25,936
- [Ellie] You didn't?

69
00:02:25,936 --> 00:02:26,769
- No.

70
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,678
- You just played inside?

71
00:02:27,678 --> 00:02:28,605
- Yeah.

72
00:02:28,605 --> 00:02:30,570
- [Ellie] What games?

73
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,210
- Monster Mash.

74
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,449
- [Calvin] Mine?

75
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:35,046
- Nuh uh uh uh uh.

76
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:36,708
- My bag.

77
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:38,124
- Where's my bag?
- You know what?

78
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:39,714
- [Ellie] Calvin are we
gonna go trick or treating

79
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:41,527
tonight, where's your bucket?

80
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:42,360
- [Jared] Go get your bucket

81
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,216
and we'll go trick or treating tonight.

82
00:02:43,216 --> 00:02:45,874
- [Ellie] Want to go trick or treat?

83
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:46,846
Okay, let me show you what I did

84
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:47,679
to the table.

85
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,815
Come here mister.

86
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:51,148
Planning is just as much fun

87
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,031
as being in the party

88
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,573
and I am planning right now.

89
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,699
I'm getting ready for lunch

90
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:57,532
- What?

91
00:02:57,532 --> 00:02:59,629
- [Ellie] and I have the table set.

92
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:02,226
Look, there's eyeballs in the drinks.

93
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:06,545
Everyone's name, this is
Boston's, eyes in the drinks,

94
00:03:06,545 --> 00:03:07,793
waiting for some cousins.

95
00:03:07,793 --> 00:03:09,054
We're gonna have a little
bit of lunch with cousins

96
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,365
and then we'll go our separate ways

97
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,533
to go trick or treating.

98
00:03:11,533 --> 00:03:13,605
- I don't know why I didn't
think of this before,

99
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:15,982
but I think I hate this part of me is

100
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm very last minute,

101
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,695
when it comes to things and planning

102
00:03:18,695 --> 00:03:19,974
like having good ideas,

103
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:21,131
it's like oh very last minute,

104
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,867
then I'm like stressed and
rushing and everything,

105
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:26,788
but I got Penny a costume.

106
00:03:26,788 --> 00:03:27,899
- I hope she loves it.

107
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:28,732
- [Jared] She's gonna hate it.

108
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:29,813
- She's gonna not love it.

109
00:03:29,813 --> 00:03:31,078
- She's not gonna love it,

110
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,743
but we'll try and see.

111
00:03:32,743 --> 00:03:34,623
If we can get one picture out of it,

112
00:03:34,623 --> 00:03:35,631
it's worth it.

113
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,642
- [Ellie] Oh my.

114
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,200
- It's a Thor costume.

115
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,362
How cute is that.
- Come on Penny,

116
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:41,385
- [Ellie] you're in this family.

117
00:03:41,385 --> 00:03:42,846
- Should I go get changed into my costume?

118
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:43,679
- [Ellie] Totally.

119
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,034
- Okay, I'll be right back.

120
00:03:45,034 --> 00:03:48,284
(upbeat digital music)

121
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:52,133
- What do you think, it's a me, a Mario.

122
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,261
Ha ha, come on out.

123
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:54,703
- [Ellie] So Jackson, we need to get you

124
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:57,079
in your Mario costume.

125
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,235
- Come on.

126
00:03:58,235 --> 00:04:02,606
- [Ellie] I like how he
said no and then okay.

127
00:04:02,606 --> 00:04:03,439
What?

128
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,661
- It's a my buddy Mario.

129
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,849
- Here's a Mario.

130
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:10,529
(laughing)

131
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:12,779
- [Ellie] You look so cute.

132
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,320
- Mario wants to play hide the pumpkin.

133
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,336
(Ellie laughs)

134
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:20,341
- [Ellie] Mario wants to
play hide the pumpkin?

135
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,180
- Yeah.

136
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,196
- [Ellie] Okay, when you're done we will.

137
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,022
Did you already do that one?

138
00:04:25,022 --> 00:04:27,281
That looks awesome.
- Yeah.

139
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:29,258
- No it looks scary.

140
00:04:29,258 --> 00:04:31,116
- [Ellie] It is scary.

141
00:04:31,116 --> 00:04:31,949
Holy moly,

142
00:04:33,684 --> 00:04:36,363
you just grew up overnight
and grew a beard.

143
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:37,196
Hi Calvin.

144
00:04:39,116 --> 00:04:40,588
Can he help do some stickers too

145
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:41,921
on this pumpkin?

146
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,259
- [Jared] I think so
it's meant for indoors.

147
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:49,092
We've got a fog machine

148
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,989
and we don't know if this is good or bad.

149
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,205
It's fogging, I guess it's a good thing.

150
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,205
Ooh wee ooh.

151
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:58,268
What do you think Jackson?

152
00:04:58,268 --> 00:04:59,286
(cries)

153
00:04:59,286 --> 00:05:01,351
- [Jared] Does it kind of
scare you a little bit?

154
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:03,159
- I think we should put
it outside, so they won't

155
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:05,200
- [Jared] Maybe at the front door, yeah.

156
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,950
- Actually yeah, ooh.

157
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,071
- [Jared] Breathe my friend.

158
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:11,204
- So as they walk in,

159
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,281
it's foggy.
- Yeah, we can do that.

160
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,596
- [Ellie] Holy moly.

161
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:15,497
- [Jared] Whoa, can't see anything.

162
00:05:15,497 --> 00:05:16,330
- This is crazy.

163
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,960
- So these are the costumes of the year.

164
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,877
I am Mario.

165
00:05:21,007 --> 00:05:22,257
Calvin is Toad.

166
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:25,526
His hat is seriously the cutest thing.

167
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,359
- And Peach.

168
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:28,500
- [Jared] You are my
princess, Princess Peach,

169
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,333
you look so beautiful.

170
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:32,348
- Thanks to Bonnie's old prom
dress that doesn't quite fit,

171
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,322
but I figured it out.

172
00:05:33,322 --> 00:05:34,741
- [Jared] Oh where are your gloves?

173
00:05:34,741 --> 00:05:35,574
Your beautiful white gloves.

174
00:05:35,574 --> 00:05:36,466
They're by the front door,

175
00:05:36,466 --> 00:05:38,074
for when I greet people.

176
00:05:38,074 --> 00:05:39,306
- Oh how sweet.

177
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,306
And Jackson,

178
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:43,905
Jackson's Mario too, like
father like son, you know.

179
00:05:43,905 --> 00:05:46,916
I knew this was gonna happen.

180
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:48,889
I got him a Luigi costume,

181
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:49,722
because I thought it would be fun

182
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,110
to have Mario and Luigi,

183
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,575
but he saw the Luigi and he's like uh-uh,

184
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:55,949
I am not player two, I'm player one,

185
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:57,278
I'm gonna be Mario.

186
00:05:57,278 --> 00:05:59,275
I couldn't find Bowser for Penny,

187
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:00,236
so we got this Thor costume,

188
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:02,436
and we're gonna put it on her right now.

189
00:06:02,436 --> 00:06:03,269
There we go.

190
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,436
- [Ellie] Pen.

191
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:09,453
That looks cute on her.

192
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:10,875
Is it too tight?

193
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:14,291
- No I don't think so,
it stretches really good.

194
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:17,433
- [Ellie] She's not gonna move.

195
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,337
- [Jared] Here let's get this hair out.

196
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:19,483
- [Ellie] She's not gonna move.

197
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:20,316
She like nope.

198
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:21,763
This is kinda like the lead collar.

199
00:06:21,763 --> 00:06:25,916
She will not walk with it, she hates it.

200
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,291
She's not gonna move.

201
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:28,124
She's not moved.

202
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:29,483
Come on Pen.

203
00:06:29,483 --> 00:06:31,233
She's not gonna move.

204
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:32,979
- Good girl.

205
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:34,131
- [Ellie] Aww Pen.

206
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,625
- We are not gonna make her suffer.

207
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:36,678
We are gonna grab one picture

208
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,873
and then we'll take it off of her.

209
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,743
- [Ellie] Oh fine.

210
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:42,434
Well take it off.

211
00:06:42,434 --> 00:06:44,984
You don't like costumes.

212
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,651
Just go play, come on.

213
00:06:46,651 --> 00:06:48,953
- I got a special treat for her.

214
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,814
Because she was such a good dog.

215
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:51,647
- Grandpa.

216
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,045
- Yes.

217
00:06:53,045 --> 00:06:54,176
- It's a locket.
- You're such a good boy

218
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:57,371
- To keep your hands
down, so I can show you.

219
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:58,957
Thank you.

220
00:06:58,957 --> 00:07:00,287
Okay.
- Isn't that pretty?

221
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,632
- [Ellie] Okay (laughs).

222
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:04,718
- Okay, put your hands down now.

223
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,051
Okay, thank you.

224
00:07:07,246 --> 00:07:08,647
- [Ellie] Hi mom.

225
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:09,480
- Isn't he cute?

226
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,313
- [Ellie] Yes.

227
00:07:10,313 --> 00:07:11,769
- Hi, thank you for inviting me.

228
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:14,164
- [Ellie] You're welcome,
your headband's cute.

229
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,823
- Thought I'd leave my day wide open,

230
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:17,704
so I can just hop in the car and come.

231
00:07:17,704 --> 00:07:19,258
- [Ellie] I know, I'm glad you're here.

232
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:20,758
- That's so funny.

233
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,114
- [Ellie] He always
tickles when he kisses.

234
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:25,205
- So she is, what's her name?

235
00:07:25,205 --> 00:07:26,326
- Princess Peach.

236
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:28,212
- Yeah Peach.
- Peach.

237
00:07:28,212 --> 00:07:29,766
- Toad.
- And he's Toad.

238
00:07:29,766 --> 00:07:32,688
- I always picked Princess Peach,

239
00:07:32,688 --> 00:07:33,930
when we were playing
- Oh yeah.

240
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,833
- but I always lost with her.

241
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,319
- [Ellie] Yeah, she's the worst.

242
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:38,927
- Yeah, I liked her because she was cute.

243
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:39,760
- [Ellie] Who's that?

244
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,593
- [Jared] Let's go get the door.

245
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,464
- [Ellie] Go get the
door, go get the door.

246
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,797
Go get the door.

247
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:47,997
(gasps)

248
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:51,331
Hi Grandma and Grandpa oh pfft.

249
00:07:51,331 --> 00:07:53,605
(laughing)

250
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:54,438
Hi Grandma.

251
00:07:54,438 --> 00:07:57,014
- [Jared] He's like I know
there are goodies in those bags.

252
00:07:57,014 --> 00:07:57,847
- Don't you look cute.

253
00:07:57,847 --> 00:07:58,847
- I love it.

254
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:03,251
(enchanting music)

255
00:08:22,347 --> 00:08:23,680
- Whatcha doing?

256
00:08:25,078 --> 00:08:27,072
Wait til everybody comes.

257
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,802
- Dad, when they get here,

258
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:31,385
I'm gonna say, it's me a Mario.

259
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:35,394
- [Jared] Aww that's perfect.

260
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,030
- A Mario, I don't know how you said that.

261
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,447
It'll be so cute.

262
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,076
- Princess Peach.

263
00:08:41,076 --> 00:08:42,238
- Princess Peach.

264
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,798
You danced with me today, huh?

265
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:45,494
He's so cute.

266
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:47,745
- It's me a Mario, Princess.

267
00:08:47,745 --> 00:08:50,078
- Oh nice to meet you Mario.

268
00:08:50,924 --> 00:08:52,257
- You look cute.

269
00:08:53,173 --> 00:08:54,360
- You're handsome.

270
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,354
(knocking on door)

271
00:08:55,354 --> 00:08:59,066
Stay here, let him answer it, stay here.

272
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:00,649
- It's me, a Mario.

273
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:02,765
- [Jared] Hi.

274
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,001
- It's me a Mario.

275
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,834
- Hi.

276
00:09:08,501 --> 00:09:09,584
- [Jared] Hi.

277
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:11,406
- You look real.

278
00:09:11,406 --> 00:09:13,008
- [Jared] It's a Mario.

279
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:15,191
Don't worry, our house is not on fire.

280
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,198
- It's a me a Mario.

281
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:19,698
- Aww and you're the princess.

282
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,543
Oh my gosh, that's so cute.

283
00:09:23,543 --> 00:09:24,941
- [Jared] Come on in guys.

284
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:28,369
Alright kiddos, come find your seats.

285
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:30,550
- [Ellie] Hey Boston,
yours is right here mister.

286
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,029
- [Jared] Eyeballs in
the juice, yum yum yum.

287
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:36,524
- Can you find
- Blue eye juice

288
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:40,391
- [Jared] Can you guys find
the eyeballs in your juice?

289
00:09:40,391 --> 00:09:42,636
- I found three of them.

290
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:43,469
- I'm gonna start with Olivia,

291
00:09:43,469 --> 00:09:45,085
is everyone hungry?

292
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,323
- Oh yeah.

293
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:48,955
- [Jared] We are starving.

294
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,589
- I found one.

295
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,991
- [Jared] You found one eyeball?

296
00:09:52,991 --> 00:09:55,274
- Oh this is my favorite, I love it.

297
00:09:55,274 --> 00:09:57,098
- We say this in the name
of Jesus Christ, Amen.

298
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,106
- [Ellie] Amen.

299
00:09:58,106 --> 00:09:59,698
- It was muffled.
- It was a big muffled.

300
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:02,415
- [Bonnie] It was muffled,
I couldn't quite hear you.

301
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:05,582
(upbeat spooky music)

302
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,621
- [Jared] Oh my goodness,
you found the eyeballs

303
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:17,437
in the blood.

304
00:10:17,437 --> 00:10:18,978
- I have three of them.

305
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:19,811
- I found a blue one.

306
00:10:19,811 --> 00:10:22,229
- [Jared] You found a green one?

307
00:10:22,229 --> 00:10:23,062
Nice.

308
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:25,666
- [Olivia] I've got two
blues and one brown.

309
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,521
- I've got a green one and a brown one.

310
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:28,551
- Oh my goodness.

311
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,160
Well if you guys know anyone

312
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,231
who are missing eyeballs,

313
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,978
we have a few left over, so.
- I have a green and a blue.

314
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:36,026
- [Jared] You have a green and a blue?

315
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:36,859
Nice.

316
00:10:38,162 --> 00:10:38,995
This is so fun.

317
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:40,937
Okay Burt Reynolds, tell
me how you did this.

318
00:10:40,937 --> 00:10:43,949
Like I can't drink anything.

319
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:45,966
- [Joel] It's meant to strain it.

320
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:47,766
- Oh it's a strainer.

321
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:48,599
Okay so I

322
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:53,496
(smacking lips)

323
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,705
- [Grandpa] I think the trick is a straw.

324
00:10:55,705 --> 00:10:56,788
- Oh a straw.

325
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:59,110
That's not a very good idea.

326
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,458
- That's not very manly is it.

327
00:11:00,458 --> 00:11:01,625
- No it's not.

328
00:11:02,464 --> 00:11:04,373
Hey Ellie, will you grab me a straw?

329
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,860
Oh, you're still recording.

330
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,832
Aww Grandma, handing
out goody bags already.

331
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,804
- [Joel] I wore my costume.

332
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,934
- Yeah, we wore our costumes,

333
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,818
right, should we get a treat Mom?

334
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,901
Oh look, he's wearing it Ellie.

335
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:20,234
He's wearing it.

336
00:11:21,091 --> 00:11:22,120
- [Ellie] Oh yay.

337
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,669
- Thanks Boston, you're a miracle worker,

338
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:25,698
you know that?

339
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:26,531
- Yeah.

340
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,642
- Isn't Mario a miracle worker?

341
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:30,170
- You're right Mario is a miracle worker.

342
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,637
Thanks for reminding me.

343
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,191
Yum.

344
00:11:34,191 --> 00:11:36,335
Have you guys seen Princess Peach?

345
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:37,320
- Yeah.
- No.

346
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,035
- [Jared] Have you seen Princess Peach?

347
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:40,062
Where's Princess Peach?

348
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:41,761
- I think I know where
she, oh I don't know.

349
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:43,398
- Where'd she go?

350
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,255
- [Grandma] She disappeared.

351
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,178
- What is this?

352
00:11:46,178 --> 00:11:47,213
- [Olivia] Can I read it?

353
00:11:47,213 --> 00:11:50,038
- Yeah what does it say?

354
00:11:50,038 --> 00:11:51,038
- Bwahahaha.

355
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,389
If you're looking for Princess Peach,

356
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:55,540
Mario, well I've taken her

357
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,373
and you can't stop me.

358
00:11:58,765 --> 00:11:59,848
Roar, Bowser.

359
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:04,321
- I think Bowser took Princess Peach.

360
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:06,722
- I know, it's a clue.

361
00:12:06,722 --> 00:12:07,869
- [Jared] You think you see a clue?

362
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,529
- It says a pit and fire,

363
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,461
there's nothing in here,

364
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,499
so maybe it's outside.

365
00:12:11,499 --> 00:12:13,326
- [Jared] Maybe you're right.

366
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:15,522
- [Boston] I don't want
to see real Bowser.

367
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:19,079
- Okay, we're not gonna see real Bowser.

368
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,888
- [Olivia] I got a clue, I got a clue.

369
00:12:20,888 --> 00:12:23,138
- [Jared] You found a clue?

370
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:26,370
You found one?

371
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,125
- Last I saw, he was heading

372
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,348
for the clouds.

373
00:12:30,348 --> 00:12:32,317
Go save Princess Peach.

374
00:12:32,317 --> 00:12:33,317
Luigi?

375
00:12:33,317 --> 00:12:34,605
- [Jared] Luigi.

376
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:37,855
(upbeat digital music)

377
00:12:52,857 --> 00:12:55,214
Let's go get this one.

378
00:12:55,214 --> 00:12:59,191
- [Olivia] Oh my gosh, Jackson's so fast.

379
00:12:59,191 --> 00:13:01,161
- [Jared] Can you hand
it to Olivia to read it?

380
00:13:01,161 --> 00:13:03,585
- Unfortunately I was so dizzy

381
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:06,858
that I couldn't tell
actually where he went,

382
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:10,767
but it seemed he was heading for the light

383
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:13,255
that keeps the night lit up.

384
00:13:13,255 --> 00:13:14,780
Your friend Toad.

385
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,516
- [Jared] Looks like we might
have to look for a light.

386
00:13:17,516 --> 00:13:19,856
You think there might be
a clue next to a light?

387
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,267
- I know a light.

388
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:22,721
- [Jared] Well let's go look for it.

389
00:13:22,721 --> 00:13:23,554
- Can you hold these?

390
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,554
- Sure I can hold these.

391
00:13:27,232 --> 00:13:28,929
So a little clue update,

392
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:30,325
we lost one of the clues.

393
00:13:30,325 --> 00:13:31,707
But luckily, these kids are so good

394
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,243
at deductive reasoning,

395
00:13:33,243 --> 00:13:34,961
they just skipped it, went for it.

396
00:13:34,961 --> 00:13:36,024
Did you find it?

397
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:36,857
- Yeah.

398
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,824
- Yeah, Boston let me read it.

399
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,502
- [Jared] Yeah, let's let Olivia read it.

400
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:42,078
- I'll push him into the jail cell

401
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:44,158
and lock him inside.

402
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,918
I'll look for a soft place to land

403
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,835
like a chair or a couch

404
00:13:50,502 --> 00:13:52,752
and then jump off the ship.

405
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:56,078
I hope you find me soon.

406
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:57,038
Princess Peach.

407
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,381
- [Jared] That's from Princess Peach?

408
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,271
- Mmm-hmm.

409
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:00,906
- [Jared] Where did she say she would go?

410
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,842
- I think she said couch.

411
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,861
- [Jared] Couch?

412
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:05,392
Should we look on the couch?

413
00:14:05,392 --> 00:14:06,225
- Yeah.

414
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:07,808
- [Jared] Let's go.

415
00:14:09,954 --> 00:14:11,535
- Princess Peach?

416
00:14:11,535 --> 00:14:13,345
- [Jared] There she is!

417
00:14:13,345 --> 00:14:15,385
It's Princess Peach.
- Princess Peach!

418
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:16,501
- Did you find me?

419
00:14:16,501 --> 00:14:18,228
- [Jared] You guys found her.

420
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:20,273
I got rid of Bowser.

421
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,571
(gasps)

422
00:14:21,571 --> 00:14:22,654
- Where is he?

423
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,468
They threw him away.

424
00:14:24,468 --> 00:14:27,084
- Don't ask too many questions.

425
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:28,428
- You know what?

426
00:14:28,428 --> 00:14:31,557
I have a prize because you found me.

427
00:14:31,557 --> 00:14:32,557
- Woo!
- Woo!

428
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:35,467
- Okay, everyone come sit on the couch

429
00:14:35,467 --> 00:14:37,918
and Princess Peach will give us a prize.

430
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,956
Come get on the couch.

431
00:14:39,956 --> 00:14:41,342
Good job Princess Peach.

432
00:14:41,342 --> 00:14:42,491
Well where is he?

433
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:43,820
We want to find him.

434
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,521
- He didn't get through it very well.

435
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:47,603
Tell me what was your
favorite thing out there.

436
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:50,574
- My favorite thing was finding the clues.

437
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:51,407
- Ooh.

438
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,965
- My favorite thing was
finding the clues too.

439
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:53,840
- It was?

440
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,634
- My favorite thing was everything.

441
00:14:55,634 --> 00:14:56,727
- Here's yours.

442
00:14:56,727 --> 00:14:58,055
Here's yours.

443
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,709
- I'm this guy.

444
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:01,619
- Yours is right there Calvin.

445
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,839
- Here he likes it, he likes costumes now.

446
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,574
- [Jared] Now he likes it.

447
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:07,649
- Go bark at Daddy, go bark at Daddy,

448
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,816
say ruff ruff.

449
00:15:10,174 --> 00:15:11,007
Say ruff.

450
00:15:11,007 --> 00:15:11,840
- [Jared] I'll open it, say ruff ruff.

451
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,673
- Ruff ruff.

452
00:15:12,673 --> 00:15:14,305
- [Boston] I got Papa Troll wow.

453
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:15,666
- I got Princess Peach.

454
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,456
- [Jared] You got Princess
Peach, that's awesome.

455
00:15:17,456 --> 00:15:19,736
- I thought you got me a Papa Troll.

456
00:15:19,736 --> 00:15:21,111
- [Ellie] Oh.

457
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,156
- That's a different universe.

458
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:23,989
Different universe in the story line.

459
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:24,822
- [Ellie] Do you want me to open it?

460
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:25,655
- Yeah.

461
00:15:25,655 --> 00:15:27,086
- I thought it looked like Papa Troll.

462
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,195
- [Jared] And you got Bowser?

463
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,278
We found him.

464
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,368
The very first house we
go to trick or treating

465
00:15:32,368 --> 00:15:34,168
is a very special house

466
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,501
and we're gonna go and do

467
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,405
our very first trick or treat house.

468
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:39,195
Party pooper and all.

469
00:15:39,195 --> 00:15:41,355
(knocking on door)

470
00:15:41,355 --> 00:15:43,732
- [Ellie] Say it loud when they answer.

471
00:15:43,732 --> 00:15:45,457
- Somebody's knocking on our door.

472
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:46,759
(gasps)
- Trick or treat.

473
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,788
- [Jared] Yay.

474
00:15:47,788 --> 00:15:49,795
- It's Spiderman.
- Spiderman!

475
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:50,628
- Hi.

476
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:55,119
And a sleeping baby.
- Longtime no see.

477
00:15:55,119 --> 00:15:57,202
- Would you like a treat?

478
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,427
- [Ellie] Say thank you.

479
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:01,260
- I forgot to mention we had

480
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,823
a little costume change.

481
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,761
- [Grandma] Yeah, I noticed that.

482
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:07,393
- [Jared] He was just like,
I want to go as Spiderman.

483
00:16:07,393 --> 00:16:08,611
- Thank you Grandma.

484
00:16:08,611 --> 00:16:10,333
- [Ellie] Do you want to
give 'em a hug and a kiss?

485
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,166
- No thanks.

486
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,943
(laughing)

487
00:16:13,943 --> 00:16:15,885
- [Ellie] Has she
recovered from her costume?

488
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:16,821
- I know seriously,

489
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,608
look at her just eyeing the kids.

490
00:16:18,608 --> 00:16:20,608
- [Jared] Go show Penny.

491
00:16:21,943 --> 00:16:24,193
(laughing)

492
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:26,280
- See here full.

493
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,850
- [Ellie] You got more?

494
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,886
(Ellie laughs)

495
00:16:31,886 --> 00:16:33,386
- Calvin, come on.

496
00:16:37,835 --> 00:16:40,082
- [Ellie] We're good.

497
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:40,915
- [Man] Good.

498
00:16:40,915 --> 00:16:42,113
- [Ellie] Say thanks Cal.

499
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:43,934
- [Man] Looks like some
kind of a wild animal.

500
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:46,316
- Hey, did they let you go inside

501
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:47,956
and pet their dog?

502
00:16:47,956 --> 00:16:48,789
- Yeah.

503
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:51,154
- You did, you did huh?

504
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,256
He went inside and pet the dog.

505
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:55,503
Those are our friends from church, huh?

506
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:57,004
That was fun.

507
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:59,507
Jackson is trick or treating
with his best friend Cody,

508
00:16:59,507 --> 00:17:01,794
not his cousin Cody, but his best friend.

509
00:17:01,794 --> 00:17:03,225
He has a thing for Cody's, I guess.

510
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:04,848
Isn't that hilarious?

511
00:17:04,848 --> 00:17:07,203
His best friend's name is Cody.

512
00:17:07,204 --> 00:17:08,522
No stay here.

513
00:17:08,522 --> 00:17:10,622
They're used to your house.

514
00:17:10,623 --> 00:17:11,455
Stay here.

515
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:13,394
- Maybe I'll get one.

516
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,291
- Yeah, you want one more?

517
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,569
- [Ellie] Say thanks Jackson.

518
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,210
- Thanks.

519
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:20,078
- [Jared] Last but not least Jacks.

520
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:21,378
Did you grab one?

521
00:17:21,378 --> 00:17:23,992
- [Jared] Did you grab one Jackson?

522
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:25,708
You want that one over there?

523
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:28,626
- Let me see what's in your bucket.

524
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,147
Whoa.

525
00:17:31,147 --> 00:17:33,491
Cal, what about you?

526
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:34,324
Whoa.

527
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,985
Was that the funnest?

528
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:37,818
- Yeah.

529
00:17:37,818 --> 00:17:39,186
- [Ellie] Did you like that?

530
00:17:39,186 --> 00:17:40,669
- Yeah.

531
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,773
- Is everyone gonna come to our house?

532
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:45,465
- [Ellie] Yeah, but now
when the door rings,

533
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:48,130
do you want to answer
and give them candy bars?

534
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,963
- Sure.

535
00:17:48,963 --> 00:17:49,938
- [Ellie] Okay.

536
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:51,739
- [Jackson] Is everyone coming?

537
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:53,625
- [Ellie] We'll have to
wait 'til the door rings.

538
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,901
- Was that fun or what.

539
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:57,899
- That was perfect.

540
00:17:57,899 --> 00:17:58,732
- [Jared] Aww.

541
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:00,137
- We went around the whole block.

542
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,945
Saw all their friends.

543
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,522
- I know and our friends too.

544
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,439
Ellie, we have friends.

545
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:08,665
- It was just fun taking our kids out.

546
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:09,537
- Yes it was.

547
00:18:09,537 --> 00:18:11,825
I don't know how people
with mustaches do it.

548
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:14,299
Like it's getting all up in my business

549
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,728
and it's itchy and scratchy too.

550
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:18,548
- Hey, what's the first
thing they're doing.

551
00:18:18,548 --> 00:18:19,381
Go look at them.

552
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:20,568
- [Jared] What are they doing?

553
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,877
- [Jackson] He opened.

554
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:24,045
- Oh you're already, whoa!

555
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:25,822
(laughs)

556
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:28,271
Slipped on an eyeball on the ground,

557
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,574
that's not dangerous at all.

558
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:31,407
I almost lost myself,

559
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:34,028
good thing I have the agility of Mario.

560
00:18:34,028 --> 00:18:36,686
Are you guys going through
all your candy already?

561
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:37,519
- Can you open this?

562
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:39,738
- [Jared] Goldfish, yeah
actually that's perfect,

563
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:41,081
we can totally have that.

564
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:43,158
- We have a unicorn.

565
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:45,741
(bright music)

566
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:52,672
- [Children] Trick or treat.

567
00:18:55,149 --> 00:18:57,149
(yells)

568
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:07,703
- Say ahh.

569
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:08,536
- Ahh.

570
00:19:08,536 --> 00:19:09,444
- Ahh.

571
00:19:09,444 --> 00:19:12,780
Guess what, you have
your two year old molars

572
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,003
breaking through right now.

573
00:19:15,003 --> 00:19:16,016
- [Jared] I saw them.

574
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,171
- Right now,

575
00:19:17,171 --> 00:19:18,377
as I was brushing his teeth to go to bed,

576
00:19:18,377 --> 00:19:21,587
I was like, oh, there you go.

577
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,882
They're in there.

578
00:19:22,882 --> 00:19:26,199
- [Jared] Good, more teeth
to chew all that candy

579
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,183
up with that you got.

580
00:19:27,183 --> 00:19:30,052
- Calvin, did you have
fun trick or treating?

581
00:19:30,052 --> 00:19:30,938
- Choc

582
00:19:30,938 --> 00:19:32,189
- Did you get chocolate?

583
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,022
- Yeah.

584
00:19:33,022 --> 00:19:34,090
- Oh good.

585
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,242
You don't have to show us.

586
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,944
- [Ellie] He says I I I I want more.

587
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:38,948
(laughing)

588
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:40,018
What did he say?

589
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,630
- He said hey no.

590
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,163
- Hey don't run away.

591
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:45,996
Did you have fun trick or treating?

592
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,225
(growling)

593
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:48,058
- Yeah.

594
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,067
Did you go door to door?

595
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,150
- Yeah treat.

596
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,743

597
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:57,949

598
00:19:57,949 --> 00:19:58,782

600
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,594
- Give me a kiss.

601
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:02,542
Oh!

602
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,925
(laughing)

603
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:06,258
- Say excuse me.

604
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:11,115
Say goodnight Dad, kisses.

605
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:13,778
- Don't try and burp now.

606
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:14,749
What a wonderful Halloween day

607
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:16,562
we were able to spend with family.

608
00:20:16,562 --> 00:20:18,295
It is now one in the morning

609
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:19,893
and I'm finishing everything up

610
00:20:19,893 --> 00:20:21,597
before Ellie and I head off to China

611
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,412
with Bonnie and Joel tomorrow.

612
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:25,841
So for now, thank you

613
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,570
And we will see you guys soon.

00:20:29,122 --> 00:20:30,881
are going to be special videos

616
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:33,474
that we have filmed in
anticipation of our trip,

617
00:20:33,474 --> 00:20:34,977
because we will not be able to upload

618
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:35,810

619
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,511

00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:38,527
So stay tuned for that.

621
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,759
