1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,390
- My morning routine has totally changed.

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:04,160
I want to fake that pregnancy glow,

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,980
so that's what I do.

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,270
- If you had a sleepover
in your room with Calvin.

5
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,117
Calvin, don't be afraid
of the vacuum, dude.

6
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:12,950
(Jared laughs)
(vacuuming)

7
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,350
- I was wrong everybody.

8
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,215
I was wrong, Jared was right.

9
00:00:17,215 --> 00:00:18,048
(harmonica playing)

10
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:19,064
Good morning.

11
00:00:19,064 --> 00:00:20,824
What face is that?

12
00:00:20,824 --> 00:00:21,657
- Good morning.

13
00:00:21,657 --> 00:00:22,550
- [Ellie] Good morning.

14
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,680
Good morning.

15
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:26,970
This is the first time Calvin's ever had,

16
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,290
or at least he doesn't get mad,

17
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,259
he got his pancake cut up today

18
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:33,310
and he was happy about it,

19
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,870
'cause Calvin had his cut.

20
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,030
But it's taken you a long time

21
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,370
to warm up to that idea of cutting

22
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,650
Mickey Mouse up, huh?

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,670
He's pondering his thoughts right now

24
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,503
as he's eating.

25
00:00:42,503 --> 00:00:45,710
We are making Mickey Mouse
pancakes this morning.

26
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,600
Due to Jackson's request.

27
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,433
Do you like 'em?

28
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,266
- Uh-huh.

29
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:52,000
- [Ellie] This plant
has been through a lot.

30
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,170
There has been a few times

31
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,070
where it has pretty much
died and come back to life.

32
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,410
And I did it,

33
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,740
I accidentally killed it,

34
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,560
I forgot to water it while we were gone.

35
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,450
And look, I watered it yesterday,

36
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,950
I trimmed it up and a
new bud is coming so,

37
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:08,040
I think it's gonna make it.

38
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,850
It's gonna pull through and be okay.

39
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,780
I really really love that plant.

40
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:15,750
And I'm so glad it's pulling through.

41
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,150
Not my typical eggs and avocado,

42
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,120
but this'll work.

43
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,270
It's so cute.

44
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,880
Do you guys remember nine months ago

45
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,570
when I brought up those little people toys

46
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,750
and put them in my bedroom
for when the kids wake up

47
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,800
that could give them
something to play with.

48
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,580
And it took a long time for them

49
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,130
to actually do it and
then they would start

50
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,220
to play with it.

51
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,520
Well now, my morning
routine has totally changed.

52
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,930
I don't know if it's because
the kids have grown up more,

53
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,004
or if it's because they really know,

54
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:46,220
Mom said this and she's
not getting gout of bed

55
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,310
or I don't know.

56
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,330
But I have a new little morning routine

57
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,510
that I've been doing.

58
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,430
It's been a very lazy one, but I love it.

59
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:56,360
I, usually when the kids
wake up at seven o'clock,

60
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,373
I'm up with them.

61
00:01:57,373 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm up with them, we're making breakfast,

62
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,490
we're going to the
bathroom, getting dressed,

63
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,180
getting going for the day at seven.

64
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,120
And that's how it's always been.

65
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,060
I've have always been up by seven anyway,

66
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,100
and that's what time my kids wake up.

67
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,900
And lately since being pregnant,

68
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,980
it's like I can't get out of bed.

69
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,730
I still need just another hour.

70
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,380
And so when the kids wake up,

71
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,220
I say go downstairs and go play together

72
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,380
and then I'll get up,
and we'll make breakfast.

73
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:26,450
And they've been doing so good.

74
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,420
Like Jared has to go
in his office at seven.

75
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,150
He starts working at seven,

76
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,490
and then the kids have been playing.

77
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,800
And sometimes they'll lay
in bed with me and snuggle,

78
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,550
sometimes I'll just turn on a show,

79
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,450
but most of the time, they leave the room,

80
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,300
so I can sleep.

81
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,950
And they go downstairs and play.

82
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:41,670
And I've been so grateful for that,

83
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,160
so that's been my routine

84
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,240
and I know that won't happen in six months

85
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,190
when baby comes, so I'm grateful for it.

86
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,023
They're down there.

87
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:49,372
Are you guys playing?

88
00:02:49,372 --> 00:02:50,950
- [Both] Yeah.

89
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,140
- So that's what we've been doing

90
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,280
and then I just get out of bed,

91
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,630
then we get ready for the day,

92
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,160
and I slowly get ready.

93
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,227
And I've been really loving that.

94
00:02:59,227 --> 00:03:01,540
(Calvin vocalizing)

95
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,100
It's been like a slow routine,

96
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,933
but I like it.

97
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:07,750
Here's the deal, the last week,
I have hardly gotten ready

98
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,750
and I want to show you
what I've been using

99
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,040
when I get ready.

100
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,340
All I've been using is
my Bobbi Brown concealer,

101
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,060
corrector under my eyes.

102
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,410
I've been using mascara,
and I've been using,

103
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,730
that's bronzer, and I've been using blush

104
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,080
and a little bit on my eyebrows.

105
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,337
So I've been doing just very little bit,

106
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:29,210
just so I can be a
little ready for the day.

107
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,000
Today's Friday, I don't
know what my plans are,

108
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,210
I don't know if we're gonna go out

109
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,090
for a date tonight.

110
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,580
I've asked a few babysitters,
I don't know if they can

111
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,230
or if Jared and I are gonna stay in,

112
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,530
just hang out with the kids.

113
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:39,363
I don't know our plans,

114
00:03:39,363 --> 00:03:41,930
so I'm just gonna get ready today,

115
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,750
ready ready today, and
a lot of people asked me

116
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,100
what concealer I've use.

117
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,160
I use the Bobbi Brown Eye Corrector first,

118
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,459
because it's like an
orange based corrector,

119
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,760
just because I have such deep eyes,

120
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,490
and I have a lot of discoloration,

121
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,520
so I just do it in the corner,

122
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,620
and that just kind of helps brighten it,

123
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,500
before I put a little concealer on it.

124
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,850
Like look how dark that inner corner is.

125
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:10,770
It doesn't matter how much sleep I get.

126
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,330
It's just kind of hereditary.

127
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,100
But it definitely looks
worse if I don't get sleep.

128
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,640
I think it's definitely more red.

129
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,750
I start with that

130
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,480
and then just because it's winter

131
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,540
and my skin is uber dry, I'm almost out.

132
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,140
I've had this for two years,

133
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,760
it's the Tatcha Luminous Dewy Spray.

134
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,380
Jacklyn Hill had talked
about it forever ago.

135
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,300
I just spray it on my hands

136
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,560
and just put it on my skin.

137
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,660
It just gives you a really glow-y look,

138
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,210
especially if you've
put your foundation on.

139
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,180
It's just really dewy,

140
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,880
it's a dewy mist,

141
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,380
and I want to fake that pregnancy glow,

142
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,451
so that's what I do.

143
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,450
(laughs)

144
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,460
My skin is super dry with the winter,

145
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,610
so this just helps.

146
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,540
I'm trying out a foundation

147
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,580
that Goss Makeup Artist talked about.

148
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,640
It's a Tom Ford foundation.

149
00:04:59,423 --> 00:05:01,238
I really like it.

150
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:04,134
I can tell why he likes this brand.

151
00:05:04,134 --> 00:05:07,120
(bright music)

152
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
On days that I really
want to get ready too,

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,510
I'll wear a Tarte concealer
over that corrector.

154
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,550
That corrector just corrects that blueness

155
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,400
and then I put just a concealer over it.

156
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,110
But, you know what has
been my favorite thing,

157
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,277
has been getting my eyebrows
micro, micro bladed?

158
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,650
Yeah, micro-bladed.

159
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,620
I'm really glad that I did.

160
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,050
I wish that I would've been able

161
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,740
to go in and get a second one,

162
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,780
because that's where the
pigment will really hold.

163
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,947
And when I have the baby
and I heal and everything,

164
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,220
I'm gonna go back and have my eyebrows

165
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,650
redone a second time.

166
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,200
I really have loved having
my eyebrows be done.

167
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,885
Excuse me.
(laughing)

168
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:53,611
Excuse me, trying to get ready here.

169
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:55,361
Excuse me, excuse me.

170
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,483
What are you doing?

171
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,120
- Poo poo butt.

172
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,300
- Don't call me a poo poo butt.

173
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,620
Talk nice to Mom.

174
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,800
Are you gonna help me?

175
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,660
- But this is not coming out.

176
00:06:10,532 --> 00:06:11,960
Can I hold it?

177
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,690
- Take that out.

178
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,260
- Okay, I got it.

179
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,060
- We are going to be
building a little table.

180
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,470
I don't know why we decided
to do it right here,

181
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,120
we just kinda took it out of the box.

182
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,990
And Jackson asked if he could help.

183
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:24,963
Ooh.

184
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,370
- Now the top.

185
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,140
- Now it says put bolt A in,

186
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,450
take your screwdriver,
start screwing it on here.

187
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,910
- Okay.

188
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,790
- Oop oop.

189
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,320
Yep, all the way down.

190
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,610
Perfect, I think that looks good.

191
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,910
- [Jackson] There is that.

192
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,644
- Next.

193
00:06:48,644 --> 00:06:49,477
- That's--

194
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,650
why do we need that?

195
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:55,589
What a splendid table.

196
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,660
That's cool.
- It's cute.

197
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,463
- [Jackson] Do we need more--

198
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,880
do we have to do it too much?

199
00:07:06,018 --> 00:07:07,499
- There we go.

200
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:09,225
Okay, come down here.

201
00:07:09,225 --> 00:07:10,857
- Okay.

202
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:13,440
(bright music)

203
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,230
- I'm doing a few set up
things around the house,

204
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:21,400
so when we had Calvin,

205
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,220
we moved his crib a lot of times.

206
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,643
We had it in with Jackson,

207
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:27,680
we moved it to his own room

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,580
and to Jared's old office,

209
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,160
then we moved it into our room.

210
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,830
We just kinda had to figure out

211
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:34,880
how life would be best.

212
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,983
And with us gonna be having
a baby in the summer,

213
00:07:38,983 --> 00:07:42,370
I'm just kind of thinking
about the bedroom scenarios

214
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,890
and Jackson and Calvin.

215
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,310
What they want, what'll be best.

216
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,270
And I think I'm gonna move some things

217
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,420
around the house tonight
with Jared's help.

218
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,670
And see how the boys do together.

219
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,000
I already know they'll do good together,

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,479
because whenever we travel,
they sleep together.

221
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,551
- Is this the right way?

222
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,640
- That is the right way.

223
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,040
When we travel, they sleep together,

224
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,729
but just so I can get a feel for it

225
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,850
night to night, them sleeping,

226
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,010
so we're gonna just
switch some stuff around.

227
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,010
I have a fun set up that I'm
gonna do with this bad boy,

228
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,600
I have some chairs
coming that I'll show you

229
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,380
when everything's here and
set up, I'll show you guys.

230
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,270
But I'm excited.

231
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,770
Your face.

232
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,280
You're concentrating, good.

233
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
Is it tightening?

234
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,050
- Mommy and Daddy were thinking

235
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,440
and we think this would be very fun.

236
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,270
I think it would be fun
if you had a sleepover

237
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,370
in your room with Calvin.

238
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,179
Would that be so much fun?

239
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,179
Would you like that?

240
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,824
You're kinda thinking
about it a little bit, huh?

241
00:08:36,825 --> 00:08:39,200
But your bed it's big,

242
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,070
but it's not that big.

243
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,179
I think we need to make some changes.

244
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,450
So what if we did this.

245
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,000
Follow me, come follow me.

246
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:49,440
Okay, hold on, hold on tight.

247
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,429
Okay, Mom is sitting on
Jackson's bed right now,

248
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:54,262
- Which we love.
- Right?

249
00:08:54,262 --> 00:08:55,300
- [Jared] We love this bed.

250
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,870
But look, come over here, follow me.

251
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,249
Yeah, this way, this way, this way.

252
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:02,190
This bed is so much bigger.

253
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,630
So what I'm thinking,

254
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:08,130
let's move this bed into your room.

255
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,010
- But we should put this
blanket on Calvin's bed.

256
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,150
- Sure we can do that.

257
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,600
So it gives you more room to
sleep on the bed with Calvin.

258
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,108
Right, would that be fun?

259
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,530
- Even there's two pillows.

260
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,740
- [Jared] Yeah, there's even two pillows

261
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,170
that you guys can have.

262
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,350
Should we do that?

263
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,360
- Yeah.
- Okay.

264
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,020
- But we can share my new blanket

265
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,290
what Santa gave me.

266
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,130
- That would be so fun, that's
so nice of you to share.

267
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:34,220
So we're thinking transitions, changes

268
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,160
and everything and this
is just the beginning.

269
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,370
This is kinda like testing the waters,

270
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,203
wouldn't you say?
- Yeah.

271
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,360
- To be honest, I've gone back and forth

272
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,820
with them sharing a room,

273
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,060
- [Jared] 100 times.

274
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,170
- And I still will,

275
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,730
but I just want to do this.

276
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:48,690
Because we were gonna bring
the other bed in here,

277
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,100
but then with both these beds in here,

278
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,610
I don't want any of them

279
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,286
- [Jared] Getting on the
shelves and everything?

280
00:09:54,286 --> 00:09:55,119
- [Ellie] Grab 'em there and fall.

281
00:09:55,119 --> 00:09:56,830
- They'll fit, both of
these beds will fit,

282
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,680
but then one bed will be right here,

283
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,755
so they'll be tempted to pull on it.

284
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:02,810
- I'm afraid they'll fall on those,

285
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,620
so we're just gonna switch them around.

286
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,440
Some people might think,

287
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,120
we'll just go put 'em in
there then for a few nights,

288
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,970
but I'm doing something in there,

289
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,940
and I can't have them in there.

290
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,060
- Yeah.

291
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,420
That room is going
through some changes too.

292
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,610
And we want to keep the crib upstairs

293
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,620
so when Calvin goes down for naps

294
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,960
for when the baby comes,

295
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,570
and all of those different things.

296
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:29,160
So we feel like this is the least amount

297
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,600
of movement with the
biggest amount of change,

298
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,540
for the most amount of experimentation.

299
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,160
- And either our decision will be

300
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,490
they'll just stay in that bed,

301
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,260
what I really want is
just to get bunk beds,

302
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,410
because I've always wanted that.

303
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,660
- Oh my gosh.
- Who wouldn't want bunk beds.

304
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,680
- [Jared] Who doesn't want bunk beds.

305
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,970
- But I think for now, this'll be fun.

306
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,740
- Yeah, gless you.

307
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,360
I caught it.

308
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,910
So this may take some time.

309
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,840
Luckily, we don't have too much,

310
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,930
because I feel the frames are
small enough and light enough,

311
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,670
we won't have to disassemble anything.

312
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,260
At least, I'm crossing
my fingers and hoping.

313
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,410
- [Ellie] Disassemble, you're
moving beds out of here,

314
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,600
totally you'll have to disassemble it.

315
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,030
- Well I'm crossing my fingers
to see if we don't have to.

316
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:10,500
- Jared, you cannot fit
a queen bed through that.

317
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:15,060
- [Jared] I will try it.

318
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,893
- No you're not.

319
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:16,760
- You can't even lift it.
- We'll see.

320
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,720
- [Ellie] I'm saying us together.

321
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,500
- Have you not seen my muscles?

322
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,010
I almost beat Joel in
an arm wrestling match

323
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,380
and--

324
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,213
- It won't fit.

325
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:28,471
You can lift it, but it's not gonna fit

326
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,040
through that little space.

327
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,157
- [Jared] We'll see, let's test it out.

328
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:32,582
- Nope.

329
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:35,165
(lively music)

330
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:43,439
(vacuuming)

331
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:45,430
- [Jared] Calvin, don't be
afraid of the vacuum dude.

332
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,430
Look, they've got like
a little barrier set up,

333
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,100
to protect themselves from you.

334
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:52,965
- That's cute.

335
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:53,850
- Taking the bed apart was actually

336
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,440
a lot easier than I thought.

337
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,820
We have these little switches
that you can just lift up,

338
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,810
instead of unscrewing it like the crib.

339
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,290
So right down there, we just lift it up

340
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,830
on the bed frame, boom,
pop that right off,

341
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,680
pulled it right out.

342
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,310
And I honestly feel like this headboard

343
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,770
is so tiny, that we can just fit that

344
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,603
through the door.

345
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:15,130
That's what I was talking about,

346
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,210
by moving it all at once.

347
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,240
Obviously we won't do it
with the mattress on it,

348
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,770
because the mattress is
heavier than all get out,

349
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,696
these mattresses are heavy.

350
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:25,279
(lively music)

351
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:31,084
Oh, good save Mom.

352
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:34,620
- I was wrong everybody.

353
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,714
I was wrong, Jared was right.

354
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,547
(harmonica playing)

355
00:12:37,547 --> 00:12:39,970
- [Jared] Okay now we're
gonna swing this over.

356
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,293
- This looks awesome.

357
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,851
- Boom baby.

358
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,699
(harmonica playing)

359
00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:53,243
What do you think?

360
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:54,076
- Yay!

361
00:12:54,076 --> 00:12:55,453
- Do you like it?

362
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:58,040
- Boing boing, it's so bouncy.

363
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,280
- [Ellie] Okay lay down, lay down

364
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,380
like you're going to sleep.

365
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,257
- [Jared] Yeah pretend like
you're gonna go to sleep.

366
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:05,040
- [Ellie] Goodnight.

367
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,873
Goodnight Cal.

368
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,020
(mock snoring)
(laughing)

369
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,010
How fitting are their pillows?

370
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,200
Jackson Calvin,

371
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,938
Batman, other avengers.

372
00:13:18,938 --> 00:13:20,200
(harmonica playing)

373
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,873
Superheroes.

374
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:23,960
- This is all just to test out

375
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,110
how the boys are together
in the same room.

376
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,943
- [Ellie] Consistently.

377
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:30,310
- Yeah, because if they
sleep through the night

378
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,380
like this, boom, we're getting bunk beds.

379
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,560
You know what I mean?

380
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,540
- [Ellie] Yes, this is cute.

381
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,810
- I like having friends
who are in the same stage

382
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,880
as us, like Bryan and Missy.

383
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,690
We've actually talked about this with them

384
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,930
and how much better
their boys are sleeping.

385
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,940
It's like, okay, let
that happen to us please.

386
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,720
Yeah, Missy was like, it
was the best decision.

387
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,560
We were a little nervous,

388
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,170
but she's like, it turned out great.

389
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:54,530
My chiropractor, she has two girls

390
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,970
and I asked her, I was like,
this is a weird question,

391
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,510
do your girls sleep together?

392
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,080
She's like not anymore, but they used to,

393
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,530
and she said that they
used to sleep better.

394
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay and what if the boys do really well

395
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,820
and we just don't buy bunk beds

396
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,710
and this is their room for two years,

397
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,740
until Jackson's like six or seven,

398
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,820
isn't that weird?

399
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,200
And then we do bunk beds.

400
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,837
Like slowly going into
it, how fun would that be?

401
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:19,670
Ah!

402
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,510
There's so many fun things.

403
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,500
Life changes.

404
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,542
I said what if we waited a few years,

405
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,420
because they're like toddlers right now

406
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,180
and when they were both
older, then do bunk beds.

407
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,013
You know?

408
00:14:33,013 --> 00:14:34,910
- He says my bed.

409
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,940
Now that Batman's on it, he's like okay,

410
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,160
I can agree with this.

411
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,200
- [Ellie] Thanks Maria.

412
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,170
Our sister-in-law Maria
made these for the kids.

413
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,330
And then some cute viewers made those

414
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,163
for the boys.

415
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:47,844
Isn't that the perfect bed?

416
00:14:47,844 --> 00:14:48,677
Go to sleep.

417
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:49,510
- [Jared] Pretend like
you're going to sleep.

418
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,343
Go to sleep.
(harmonica playing)

419
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:52,620
- I'm sure everyone
listening is like uh shh.

420
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,210
Okay, shh, go to sleep.

421
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:57,686
- My snacks.

422
00:14:57,686 --> 00:14:59,146
- Hey no!

423
00:14:59,146 --> 00:15:00,718
- [Ellie] The clock is yellow.

424
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:01,551
- Hey no!

425
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:03,188
- Hold your horses there,

426
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:06,427
hold your horses, hold your horses.

427
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,902
- Oh my gosh.
- Hold your horses.

428
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:09,253
(laughing)

429
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:10,962
hold your horses.

430
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:13,450
Oh, it's a crazy horse!

431
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,515
It's a crazy horse!

432
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,765
(laughing)

433
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,657
Are you guys ready for your bed?

434
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:22,002
- Yes.
- Yeah.

435
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:23,390
- [Jared] Yay.

436
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,980
- What book are we gonna read?

437
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,802
- Little Blue Truck Halloween.

438
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,587
- Woo hoo.
- Woo hoo.

439
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:30,296
- I love Halloween.

440
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,190
- Get under the covers.

441
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,480
- [Jared] Yeah, let's get
under the covers boys.

442
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,660
- You cannot get out of bed.

443
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,570
I want you to not get in Mommy's bed.

444
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,403
Okay Calvin?

445
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,179
- Why?
- This is my bed.

446
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,012
- This is your bed.

447
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:45,860
- Because you have a baby in your tummy?

448
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,310
- Because I have a baby in my tummy

449
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,411
and Mommy needs to sleep.

450
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:50,310
- Mama baby.

451
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,460
- Okay, I need to sleep.

452
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,380
I need to sleep!

453
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,300
- [Jared] That's so true.

454
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,740
When this clock, this clock is blue okay?

455
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,660
When it turns yellow,

456
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,248
you can get out of bed okay?

457
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:02,081
- Yes!

458
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:02,914
- But Jackson's good at that.

459
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:04,320
- [Jared] Jackson's really good at that.

460
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,070
So you help your little brother Calvin

461
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,950
stay in bed until it's yellow, okay?

462
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,850
- Okay.

463
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,420
- Hey don't punch me.
- Okay, ready to read?

464
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:14,162
(laughing)

465
00:16:14,162 --> 00:16:15,570
- This is our kind of world.

466
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:18,320
The boys fell asleep really well.

467
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,030
Calvin took a lot longer like usual,

468
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,750
which is fine.

469
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,755
- Let's peek on 'em.

470
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:25,338
(gentle music)

471
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:28,586
Look at his foot.

472
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,480
So far, so good.

473
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,140
It's been a few hours,
since they've gone to sleep,

474
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,066
so hopefully things stay this way.

475
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,302
- We'll let you know.

476
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,680
- Yeah, so stay tuned
for tomorrow morning,

477
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,557
where we find out how
things actually went.

478
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,980
But for now, we are
going to say goodnight.

479
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,250
It is Friday night

480
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,630
and we are gonna go to bed.

481
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,310
So thank you guys so much for watching

482
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,520
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

483
00:16:59,520 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
