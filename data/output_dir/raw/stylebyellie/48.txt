1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
- Singing at a funeral
is a difficult thing,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,765
even though I've only done it one time.

3
00:00:03,765 --> 00:00:05,440
I just get emotional thinking about it.

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,900
- [Ellie] Hey, Mr. Dance Man let's go.

5
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,130
- She said, "I have watched
Ellie and Jared every day

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,670
"for four years."

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,300
- Oh my gosh.

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,414
- What do you have to say
for yourself about this?

9
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:20,740
And this? And this?
(dramatic music)

10
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,030
Good morning guys, I hope
you're having a great day.

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,610
Today we're kind of starting
off on a sad, solemn note.

12
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,810
Someone from our
neighborhood has passed away,

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,900
a very unfortunate thing.

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,020
And you're probably wondering
why I am dressed up like that,

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,750
it's because the funeral is today

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,540
and they've asked me
to sing at the funeral.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,490
And I am very happy to be a part of this,

18
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,690
but it's also a very, very sad thing.

19
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,170
I've only sang at one
funeral before in my life,

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,530
and it was my Grandpa's.

21
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,190
Just get emotional thinking about it.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,260
Singing at a funeral is a difficult thing

23
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,100
even though I've only done it one time.

24
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,530
My dad is a very, very talented singer,

25
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,070
much more talented than I am,

26
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,580
and he has sung at a lot of funerals

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,500
because we were in Spokane
everyone knew my dad

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,560
was an incredible singer,

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,080
and a lot of people asked
him to sing at their funerals

30
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,960
before they even passed away.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,951
So we talked a little bit yesterday about

32
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,600
getting your mind and your
heart in the right place

33
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,106
to sing at a funeral.

34
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:30,100
Like I said, I'm honored that
someone would think of me

35
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,300
to sing at their funeral,

36
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,300
but it's still a very
hard and difficult thing,

37
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,840
but that's why I'm dressed up

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,610
in my suit today on a Thursday;

39
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,220
I am going to sing at a funeral today.

40
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,300
Ellie and I believe that

41
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,854
the end of this life isn't the end.

42
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:53,480
So funeral for us aren't
always the saddest thing.

43
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,240
I think that's pretty special

44
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,080
and it makes funerals
feel a little different

45
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,870
than what most people are accustomed to.

46
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,470
They're not always just sad.

47
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,500
It's kind of peaceful.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:13,220
And I'm hoping that we have
a very peaceful day today.

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,670
- There are two kind of sippy
cups that I really like.

50
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,212
These are Re-Play sippy cups.

51
00:02:19,212 --> 00:02:21,560
I get them, you can get them online,

52
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,269
or like C-A-L Ranch, like a country store.

53
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,870
And the Nalgene bottles.

54
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,970
These are probably my absolutely favorite.

55
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,280
They're Nalgene sippy cups.

56
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,260
I've posted an Instagram picture.

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,910
A lot of people wanted to
know what sippy cups we use.

58
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,430
The Nalgene one is my favorite.

59
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,620
I'm getting the boys a drink.

60
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,530
Jackson's going getting the
kids a little lunch prepared

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:43,642
because we're gonna get in the

62
00:02:43,642 --> 00:02:45,789
car and drive to Target today.

63
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:48,500
We're just gonna hang out
at Target for a few hours

64
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,769
because it's an hour away,
we're gonna go look around

65
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,690
at some baby stuff and just hang out.

66
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,620
I just got back from the
chiropractor appointment

67
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,280
and I always feel much better when I go,

68
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,560
so feelin' really good,
we're gonna get out

69
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,200
of the house for a little bit,
gotta make the kids a lunch.

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,370
This happens to me every
single time I go out shopping.

71
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,610
Usually when I'm with the
kids and out shopping,

72
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,090
I know I'm not gonna get much done,

73
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,350
'cause it's more of us just
getting out of the house,

74
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:15,609
walking around the store,
they love to look at the toys,

75
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:18,900
but I'm making a list because I

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,430
get overwhelmed when I go into stores,

77
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,740
and especially with the kids.

78
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,710
Like, I forget what I need.

79
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,900
So I'm writing down that I'm looking for

80
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,280
bins for the closet for Jared and I,

81
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm looking at stuff for
the mantel downstairs,

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,140
and I'm looking at maternity stuff.

83
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,712
And then I wrote down
how old the baby will be

84
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:39,530
for these months, because
I'm hoping to find,

85
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,570
'cause it's kinda toward
the end of winter,

86
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,250
I'm hoping to find like
a winter snow outfit

87
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,620
for like a three to six
or six to nine month old.

88
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,750
I don't know what one to get,

89
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,030
because he'll be six to nine
months November to January,

90
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,596
but he'll probably be
small like these dudes.

91
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:57,740
And I could get away with three to six.

92
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,610
I don't know, but I'm
hoping to find like a

93
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,650
like a winter snow outfit
for the baby for next year,

94
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,440
so it covers his feet up
to his hands, you know?

95
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,530
We'll see what they've got,

96
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,260
it'll just be fun to look around,

97
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,240
but I do try and make a list especially

98
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,870
when I go to Target because
then I end up just like,

99
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,970
getting overwhelmed.

100
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:18,720
Before Jared goes, he's
measuring everything for me.

101
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,410
He's been so good.

102
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,880
He's measuring all of this
because I'm thinking maybe,

103
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,368
this summer it might be nice
to even have shades outside.

104
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,420
But who knows, that might not happen,

105
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,414
'cause it's taken us a year
to get shades right here.

106
00:04:32,414 --> 00:04:33,247
(laughing)

107
00:04:33,247 --> 00:04:34,796
Did you draw me a picture?

108
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:37,030
I love that!

109
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,717
Right on my list.

110
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:39,780
(laughing)

111
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,290
That looks great!

112
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,917
And did you make a mess?

113
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:44,916
(agreeing)

114
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:47,725
Okay, let's go get Jackson.

115
00:04:47,725 --> 00:04:48,781
Bye dad!

116
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:49,900
- Bye dad!

117
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,420
- [Jared] By now!

118
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,000
- [Ellie] Got your crackers?

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,589
Where are they?

120
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,630
(laughing)

121
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:00,025
Got the kids lunch, got
Calvin's potty, my wallet.

122
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:02,020
What did you find?

123
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,040
- Binky.

124
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,150
- [Ellie] Wow!

125
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:06,116
Should we get those for Calvin?

126
00:05:06,116 --> 00:05:06,949
- No.

127
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:07,782
(laughing)

128
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:09,140
- [Ellie] That's a joke.

129
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,750
Jackson, did you make this at school?

130
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:11,810
- [Jackson] I did.

131
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,720
- You did, good job!

132
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,600
K, we found Jackson some
(gasping) rain boots,

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,490
and you can wear Jackson's
yellow ones from last year.

134
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:24,270
Look how cute Target's baby clothes are!

135
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,940
Look how cute those jammy's.

136
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,620
That is so cute!

137
00:05:29,892 --> 00:05:33,685
Wow, that's so fun.

138
00:05:33,685 --> 00:05:34,518
- Bink!

139
00:05:34,518 --> 00:05:36,040
- [Ellie] Did you find the binky's?

140
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,460
Wow!

141
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,043
(upbeat music)

142
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:44,360
Okay Mr. Dance Man, let's go!

143
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:49,630
(laughing)

144
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,410
Who doesn't love a dance party in Target?

145
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,157
Oh, and he's done, he's out.

146
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:56,371
Okay, let's go, let's go.

147
00:05:56,371 --> 00:05:57,372
- Okay.

148
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:59,480
- So I just got back from the funeral.

149
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,480
And, funerals are, it's such
a interesting thing to go to.

150
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,380
I like going to funerals because it's,

151
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,940
it puts life into perspective.

152
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,980
And it makes you think
about who you interact with,

153
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,730
and why you interact with them,

154
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,250
and what you do together.

155
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,230
People are important.

156
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,063
- Yes.

157
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:25,500
- Family is important.

158
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,799
- As much as sometimes
you can't stand them.

159
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,799
- Yeah, it's true.
- It's true that

160
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,939
- I wanna say it.

161
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:31,366
- The end is important
- yeah!

162
00:06:31,366 --> 00:06:33,142
- But sometimes you get--

163
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,670
- Sometimes you get in
arguments with your brothers.

164
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:38,760
But then you realize those
little things just don't matter.

165
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,630
And family matters.

166
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,636
I wanted to tell a story about the funeral

167
00:06:45,636 --> 00:06:47,840
and me singing at the funeral.

168
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,120
And, it goes back a couple days.

169
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,220
I got a text message from
someone in our church

170
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,150
asking if I would sing at the funeral.

171
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,020
And of course I said
yes, and my thought was,

172
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,890
like oh I'm in the
primary, doing the music,

173
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,530
and I'm now in the church
choir, so maybe that's why.

174
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,540
So I'm thinkin' it's about, you know,

175
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:13,360
I'm kinda showing people
that I am okay with singing,

176
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,510
and I have this calling where
teach music to the kids,

177
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,010
and I think that's why they asked me.

178
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,100
I get to the church today, because,

179
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,532
we practiced a little bit before we sang.

180
00:07:24,532 --> 00:07:27,560
And one of the ladies came up to me

181
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,720
and she said, thank you
so much for doing this.

182
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I wanted to tell you the
story about the lady,

183
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:40,870
and she said, I visited with
her the day before she passed.

184
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,050
And we were just talking
about things that we love

185
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,210
about life and things that we cherish,

186
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,510
and things that make us laugh,

187
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,320
and she asked her, she said,
do you ever just watch,

188
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,530
get on YouTube and
watch these funny videos

189
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,460
that just make you laugh and smile?

190
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,280
And she said, I have watched Ellie

191
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,500
and Jared every day for four years.

192
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,780
- Oh my gosh!

193
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,890
- And I had no idea about this.

194
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,260
She said I've, me and my daughter,

195
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,870
we watch Ellie and Jared every single day.

196
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,342
And I just broke down right there.

197
00:08:14,342 --> 00:08:16,620
Because I had no idea.

198
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,650
I mean I've seen her in
church and everything,

199
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,400
but she never said anything to us.

200
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,240
She never mentioned anything to us,

201
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,568
and I just can't help but think,

202
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:28,820
I wish I would have known.

203
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,180
- You know?
- Yeah.

204
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,960
- Maybe I would have
done something different.

205
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,390
Maybe we would have talked more,

206
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,150
maybe we would have, you know,

207
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,929
caught more smiles at
each other in the hallway.

208
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,429
You know, I remembered, you know,

209
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,649
the kids waving and stuff like that,

210
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,110
but I just can't help but think

211
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,930
if I wish, if I would have known,

212
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,860
what would I have done differently?

213
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,430
And it just made singing at the

214
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:55,070
funeral so much more special,

215
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,338
that I got to be a part of that.

216
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:02,810
And it just made, it just
was more meaningful to me.

217
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,870
And I'm glad that I had an opportunity to,

218
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,910
that we had an opportunity
to play a part in her life.

219
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,060
Especially with her daughter.

220
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,140
And I'm just grateful.

221
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,110
Like I said, funerals just
put things into perspective.

222
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:21,600
For example, you never
know who's watching.

223
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,450
Vlogs are not, this is not about, like,

224
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,920
YouTube and everything, but it's just that

225
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,860
you never know who's
looking and watching you,

226
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,770
for your example.

227
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,325
And it just makes me realize, like,

228
00:09:32,325 --> 00:09:34,660
I want to be that much better of a person.

229
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,690
Because, you know, we all have bad days.

230
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,843
- No, totally.
- We all have,

231
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,393
- you know, so we get mad at our kids and,

232
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,440
but, it just makes me want to
be just a little bit better,

233
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,080
because I never know
who exactly is watching.

234
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,390
And it makes me wanna take
this platform that we have.

235
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,169
- Be the better, bigger person.

236
00:09:51,169 --> 00:09:53,020
- Yeah, and use it for good.

237
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,490
And I hope that we are
doing the best that we can

238
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,510
to use this for good.

239
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,510
And, my heart and prayers are
with the family right now.

240
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,370
And--

241
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:08,163
- Absolutely.

242
00:10:08,163 --> 00:10:09,890
- It's a hard time and,

243
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,330
- It turned into something
- That's wonderful.

244
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,293
- Absolutely I would do,

245
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:15,510
but then it just turned more special.

246
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,470
And, I'm grateful for this,
and I'm grateful for life.

247
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,350
And the other thing about
the funeral is you learn

248
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,030
so much about someone that
you never knew before.

249
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,520
And it's just like, I wish
I would have taken more time

250
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,377
to interact more and,

251
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:32,040
so I guess that's my message
about this whole thing,

252
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,950
is let's take time to
be with each other more.

253
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,295
To learn more about our
neighbors and friends.

254
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,762
And to be kind to each other.

255
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:42,512
(acoustic music)

256
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:07,002
♪ Every day I lay in bed, ♪

257
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:09,650
♪ Greatest love fill my head ♪

258
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,830
- [Jared] Yeah, that's right!

259
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,420
Good job bud.

260
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,290
What's that from?

261
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,633
- Rain song.

262
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,810
- That's that song?

263
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,640
Excuse me you two!

264
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,660
What do you have to say
for yourself, about this?

265
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,300
- And this, and this?
(dramatic music)

266
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,080
And this, huh?

267
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,600
What do you have to say for yourself?

268
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,150
This is a mess, and we
need to clean it up.

269
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:31,800
K, here's the agenda for
the rest of the evening.

270
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,300
We are going to clean this mess up.

271
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,120
We are going to clean you
up, IE get in the bathtub,

272
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,630
and if timing is good, we'll
play a little game after that.

273
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,021
How does that sound?

274
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:42,854
- Good.

275
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,210
- [Jared] Good, K, let's clean this up.

276
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,390
Good work bud!

277
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,400
You're doing great!

278
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,500
Good job.

279
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,050
Are you kinda just here for the ride?

280
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,060
Going along for the ride?

281
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,680
Is that what you're doin'?

282
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,940
Yeah!

283
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,681
That's what I'm talkin' about.

284
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,520
You're doing great bud!

285
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,560
There you go.

286
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:01,700
- [Ellie] I just had a
little flip out moment,

287
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,170
I like have anxiety with,

288
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,620
'cause he's like, you
don't wanna rip the sore.

289
00:12:07,581 --> 00:12:09,250
I have anxiety about this.

290
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,980
- [Jared] I'm just tryin'
to get these outer edges.

291
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,100
Okay, here it comes.

292
00:12:13,374 --> 00:12:15,397
- Ellie!
- Is it sore?

293
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,630
- [Jared] Yeah.

294
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,030
It looks really sore, I feel so bad.

295
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,449
It is, from the top of
my finger, to my knuckle.

296
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:23,282
(moaning)

297
00:12:23,282 --> 00:12:24,877
That's big, Ellie!

298
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,048
(laughing)

299
00:12:26,048 --> 00:12:26,881
Aw.

300
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:29,695
- I'm gonna end the vlog
for the night, guys.

301
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:33,310
So we just showed you Jared
removing my bandage on my back.

302
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,990
If you feel like you have any spots

303
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,530
that you wanna get checked out,

304
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,300
now is the time to go to the doctor.

305
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
You're not too young to go and

306
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,670
just have a thorough look over.

307
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,450
I'm so glad that I went in
and had this checked out.

308
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:47,370
Who knows what would
have happened if I waited

309
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,190
even like a few more years.

310
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,856
It's just crazy, life can be so crazy.

311
00:12:51,856 --> 00:12:56,750
So thank you guys so much
for watching our vlog,

312
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,690
not just today, but every day.

313
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,890
I hope you guys find something
fun to do this weekend.

314
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,830
I know Jared and I have some fun plans.

315
00:13:03,830 --> 00:00:00,000
So, we'll see you guys tomorrow, bye.
