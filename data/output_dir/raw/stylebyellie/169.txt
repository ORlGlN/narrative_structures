1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:03,409
(tender guitar music)

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,617
- [Ellie] This is where we go poo poo.

3
00:00:14,617 --> 00:00:16,263
- Yeah.

4
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:19,219
- [Ellie] You're gonna make
sure you go poop here, huh?

5
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:20,287
- Mmm-mmm.

6
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:22,287
- Okay, you keep trying.

7
00:00:24,222 --> 00:00:25,671
Yeah, you're doing so good.

8
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:26,878
(laughs)

9
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:27,711
- [Calvin] Yeah.

10
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:29,544
- I'm so proud of you.

11
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:31,551
(laughing)

12
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:33,033
Just like I did with Jackson,

13
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,569
I tried to get him warmed
up to sitting on a toilet,

14
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:38,857
before we went full force potty training.

15
00:00:38,857 --> 00:00:40,940
And Calvin has been doing really good

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,612
around the toilet,

17
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:44,124
where he will be willing to sit

18
00:00:44,124 --> 00:00:46,300
for just a second, and then he'll hurry

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,133
and get off.

20
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:49,173
And I'm really happy with how he has been

21
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:51,253
at least willing to be around the toilet.

22
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:54,309
It took Jackson quite a
while to warm up to that,

23
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,325
but because Calvin sees
Jackson all the time

24
00:00:56,325 --> 00:00:58,755
going potty, he's willing
to sit on the potty.

25
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:02,309
I definitely feel like
I'm warming him up to it,

26
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:04,052
and then here, really soon, he'll be ready

27
00:01:04,052 --> 00:01:06,299
to be potty trained.

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,028
I don't feel like he's quite ready

29
00:01:08,028 --> 00:01:11,612
to go full force,
personally, but we'll see.

30
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:14,779
(gentle guitar music)

31
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:41,239
We could bring your teepee out.

32
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,872
Should we bring your teepee out too?

33
00:01:42,872 --> 00:01:45,092
- This should be our home.

34
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:45,925
- Okay.

35
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:47,117
The weather outside is chilly

36
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:49,013
and so the best thing to do inside

37
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:52,519
other than watch TV all
day, is build some forts.

38
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,352
And then build some forts,

39
00:01:53,352 --> 00:01:54,813
so you can continue watching TV all day.

40
00:01:54,813 --> 00:01:56,408
Right, am I right?

41
00:01:56,408 --> 00:01:58,233
- Teepee home.

42
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,349
- [Ellie] That's your teepee home.

43
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:01,476
We've got a bar stool area.

44
00:02:01,476 --> 00:02:03,365
It's your teepee home.

45
00:02:03,365 --> 00:02:06,045
Okay, let's get our
rocks out and our pillows

46
00:02:06,045 --> 00:02:08,645
and we can lay here, pop some popcorn.

47
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,565
Sound good?

48
00:02:09,565 --> 00:02:10,398
- Yeah.

49
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,231
- Yeah.

50
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:13,386
- Okay.
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

51
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:14,219
- Movie.

52
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:15,933
- Uh, Halloween movie?

53
00:02:15,933 --> 00:02:18,702
- Let's watch a Christmas one.

54
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:19,535
- What?

55
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:21,843
You can't skip Halloween and Thanksgiving.

56
00:02:21,843 --> 00:02:23,061
- I need to do a Christmas.

57
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,721
- Find, Polar Express it is.

58
00:02:25,721 --> 00:02:27,593
Do you want to show them
all the ones you learned?

59
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:28,946
- Yes, this one and this one.

60
00:02:28,946 --> 00:02:29,934
- Okay, sit down and tell us.

61
00:02:29,934 --> 00:02:31,870
Jackson and I went over letters today,

62
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,639
and he is on level two with pre-school.

63
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,648
So this is still a rough draft,

64
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,086
we just learned them today.

65
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:38,350
Show 'em what you learned.

66
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,670
- I learned this one.

67
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,624
- [Ellie] What is it?

68
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:41,902
- [Jared] What is it?

69
00:02:41,902 --> 00:02:42,735
- [Jackson] It's an A.

70
00:02:42,735 --> 00:02:43,568
- That's right.

71
00:02:43,568 --> 00:02:45,701
- Look really close.
- What sound is this?

72
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:46,659
- Da.

73
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:47,492
- And what's this?

74
00:02:47,492 --> 00:02:48,325
- E.

75
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:49,158
- D-E.

76
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:50,404
- De.

77
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,009
- De, good job.
- De.

78
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,109
- [Jared] Good.

79
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:53,942
- V.

80
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:54,775
- [Jared] Good job.

81
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:55,899
(laughs)

82
00:02:55,899 --> 00:02:58,006
- [Ellie] He learned all these today.

83
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:58,839
- R.

84
00:02:58,839 --> 00:03:01,077
- [Jared] Arrr, like a pirate.

85
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:01,910
- Arr.

86
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,410
- [Ellie] That was a hard one.

87
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:06,418
- M.

88
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,644
- [Jared] So close.

89
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:11,330
- [Ellie] Remember he's going, N.

90
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:12,734
- [Jackson] N.

91
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,995
- N.
- Yeah, N.

92
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,036
- [Ellie] Good job.

93
00:03:15,036 --> 00:03:16,566
He learned those today.

94
00:03:16,566 --> 00:03:17,399
- That's all level two.

95
00:03:17,399 --> 00:03:19,807
- [Ellie] Show Daddy the level one.

96
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:20,640
- E.

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,197
- [Jared] Good.

98
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:23,176
- S.

99
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:24,426
- [Jared] Yeah.

100
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:28,463
Oh that's a good picture.

101
00:03:28,463 --> 00:03:30,068
- Yeah.

102
00:03:30,068 --> 00:03:31,305
- K!

103
00:03:31,305 --> 00:03:32,705
- K. (laughs)

104
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:33,538
- T.

105
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:35,447
- Good.
- Good job.

106
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,596
- Jackson I'm so proud of you.

107
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:38,663
Good job, buddy.

108
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:40,991
Wait, what did you do downstairs?

109
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,991
- We made a blanket fort downstairs.

110
00:03:45,272 --> 00:03:47,395
- You made a blanket fort downstairs?

111
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:48,912
Well why are you keeping this a secret.

112
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:49,747
Show me!

113
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,667
Let's go look at it.

114
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,843
I gotta see this.

115
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,751
I can't believe you're making
blanket forts without me.

116
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,212
- [Ellie] That's what you
get for going to church.

117
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,179
(laughing)

118
00:04:01,179 --> 00:04:04,236
- Hey, at least I've been
spiritually uplifted.

119
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:07,088
Oh, close my eyes, sorry.

120
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:08,379
Yeah!

121
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:09,754
Let's try again.

122
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,204
Come on Jackson.

123
00:04:11,204 --> 00:04:14,323
(chill music)

124
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,156
Woo!

125
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,275
Yeah!

126
00:04:20,144 --> 00:04:22,089
Woo, that was a good trick.

127
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,929
Okay, Mom your turn.

128
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:24,762
Whoa.

129
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:28,698
Oh, I can tell this is gonna be a big one.

130
00:04:28,698 --> 00:04:30,836
This is gonna be a big one.

131
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:33,413
Whoa, he jumped over it.

132
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,101
Did he just pick a flower for you?

133
00:04:35,101 --> 00:04:36,364
- Yes, thank you.

134
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,903
- Awww, that's cute.

135
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,943
- And just like that, it was winter.

136
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:41,464
Look at these hats
- Seriously,

137
00:04:41,464 --> 00:04:42,297
- I mean,

138
00:04:42,297 --> 00:04:43,130
- the boys are wearing.

139
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:44,120
- We live in the mountains.

140
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,603
- I'll bring a flower for you.

141
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:47,098
- Okay.
- Aww, that's sweet.

142
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,023
- We live in the mountains,

143
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:50,023
so it's colder than down

144
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,521
in other places, I guess.
- In the valley.

145
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,674
- But I just didn't
expect it to be so quick.

146
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:57,879
It's very quick.
- Oh no, it's cold.

147
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,707
- My hands, I'm like, I need to get gloves

148
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,484
or something like that.
- Oh thank you.

149
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,481
- Thank you.

150
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,700
- Man, we get all four
seasons, and they just

151
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,533
- They come really fast.

152
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,699
- Come really fast and go really fast.

153
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:09,326
The ones you want don't
stick around very long

154
00:05:09,326 --> 00:05:10,459
and the ones you don't want, they're like,

155
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:13,107
hey neighbor, I'm here to
see ya, how's it going.

156
00:05:13,107 --> 00:05:15,149
A couple days ago, we
took our family pictures,

157
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,131
and I'm gonna put a picture
that I posted on Instagram

158
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:19,372
right now, make sure you're following me

159
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:20,808
on Instagram, because we'll be posting

160
00:05:20,808 --> 00:05:22,047
more of those soon,

161
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,629
but the colors on the
leaves were just absolutely

162
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,365
breathtaking, and we live
close to those leaves,

163
00:05:28,365 --> 00:05:30,716
so I figured we'd drive by

164
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:34,214
and fly the drone out,
because it is just fiery red,

165
00:05:34,214 --> 00:05:35,986
beautiful yellow and they're som green,

166
00:05:35,986 --> 00:05:37,579
so there's some really great contrast.

167
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,893
And fall leaves are
probably the best part.

168
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:40,878
- That's Mommy.

169
00:05:40,878 --> 00:05:42,287
- Hi.

170
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:43,897
- Wait, what were you guys saying?

171
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:45,397
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

172
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,715
- Cock-a-doodle-doo, poo poo.

173
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,927
- [Jared] Cock-a-doodle-doo.

174
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,201
Calvin, can you say it?

175
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,034
- [Calvin] Da da doo.

176
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:54,998
- -[Jared] Cock-a-doodle-doo.

177
00:05:54,998 --> 00:05:56,248
- Da da doo da.

178
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,897
(Jared laughing)

179
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:01,143
- Waa, Penny, oh no!

180
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:03,708
Alright sweetheart, are you
ready to go on this ride?

181
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:06,367
Wait wait, you're not Ellie.

182
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,492
What the?

183
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,742
Hey, huh, what?

184
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:12,640
(Ellie laughs)

185
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,890
(majestic piano music)

186
00:07:18,086 --> 00:07:21,419
(majestic piano music)

187
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:08,588
- So you know what I was thinking

188
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:09,618
while we were on our walk?

189
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:10,719
- My shoes.
- Yeah?

190
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:12,786
- Your shoes, let's fix it.

191
00:08:12,786 --> 00:08:14,631
So what I was thinking on our walk,

192
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,840
is we have very long
winters where we live.

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,430
Our first winter here, it wasn't too bad.

194
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,469
Last winter was crazy.

195
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:22,302
- Crazy.

196
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,967
- And this winter is
supposed to be bad too.

197
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,974
I feel like, especially
during the winter months,

198
00:08:25,974 --> 00:08:27,598
we're gonna be doing a lot of challenges

199
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:29,285
in the month, don't you think?

200
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:30,118
- Oh yeah.

201
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,479
- Because we're gonna be inside a lot,

202
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,544
so it would be fun to break it up

203
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,631
for us and for the vlog wise.

204
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:35,464
- [Jared] Totally.

205
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,297
- I think that would be fun.

206
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,130
- I think that would be so much mun.

207
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,471
- We haven't done very many.

208
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,256
- No, so what challenges should we do?

209
00:08:40,256 --> 00:08:41,531
- Totally, I want to do some.

210
00:08:41,532 --> 00:08:42,365
- I do too.

211
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:43,198
- Do you want to do some?

212
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,030
- Yeah.

213
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,844
- Jackson, do you want to do some?

214
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:46,677
- [Jackson] Yeah.

215
00:08:46,677 --> 00:08:47,865
- Okay.
- Okay.

216
00:08:47,865 --> 00:08:49,536
- Ready, family challenge

217
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:50,803
(howling)

218
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:52,108
- But when it's all said and done,

219
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:55,211
winter is coming and I
am not ready for this.

220
00:08:55,211 --> 00:08:56,345
Like I'm not ready.

221
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:57,394
(Ellie laughs)

222
00:08:57,394 --> 00:08:59,032
- [Ellie] We've been so spoiled.

223
00:08:59,032 --> 00:09:02,063
- My fingers are like, I can't even grip.

224
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:05,063
- Look my nose is cold, it's purple.

225
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,111
But look at the view.

226
00:09:09,111 --> 00:09:09,944
- [Jared] That's beautiful.

227
00:09:09,944 --> 00:09:11,354
- [Ellie] I love where we live.

228
00:09:11,354 --> 00:09:12,572
- [Jared] I do, I love it,

229
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:13,408
- [Ellie] It's beautiful.

230
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,241
- [Jared] It's just cold.

231
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:15,498
- [Ellie] The kids are like, I'm done.

232
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:16,841
- I just went over all the footage

233
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,277
from the drone, and I noticed that there's

234
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:19,293
a lot more brown than I thought.

235
00:09:19,293 --> 00:09:22,511
Like literally the
leaves change like that,

236
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:26,791
it is crazy how fast we've
already, not missed it,

237
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,174
but it's already changing into drab brown.

238
00:09:30,174 --> 00:09:32,552
It's not as red as I wanted it to be,

239
00:09:32,552 --> 00:09:36,217
but that also reminded me
of it being super cold.

240
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:38,474
It reminded me of living in Finland.

241
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:40,504
And I, whoa, Penny, not again.

242
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:41,837
Ahh, hey sister.

243
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,033
Okay.

244
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:44,866
Alright.

245
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:47,117
I was reminded of when I lived in Finland,

246
00:09:47,117 --> 00:09:48,477
it gets really cold in the
winter time in Finland,

247
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,947
I think I saw negative
40 was the coldest I saw,

248
00:09:50,947 --> 00:09:53,688
that's the same, Celsius and Fahrenheit.

249
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:56,905
But these Finns, they were
talking to me about wintertime,

250
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,761
and they were like, you Americans,
you don't like the cold.

251
00:09:59,761 --> 00:10:01,072
And I was like, yeah, there's some people

252
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:01,905
who like the cold,

253
00:10:01,905 --> 00:10:04,054
there's some people
that like snowboarding.

254
00:10:04,054 --> 00:10:07,110
It's nice to have hot
chocolate and sit by the fire

255
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,943
and all of that stuff,

256
00:10:07,943 --> 00:10:09,790
and they're like that's exactly my point.

257
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,662
You guys like to be warm.

258
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:13,806
You like to sit by the fire,

259
00:10:13,806 --> 00:10:15,542
you don't like to be in the cold.

260
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:17,701
You don't like hot chocolate
because it's cold outside,

261
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,830
you like hot chocolate
because it makes you warm.

262
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,663
- Totally.

263
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,926
- And I was like oh my
gosh, you have a point.

264
00:10:22,926 --> 00:10:26,997
And then it's funny, because
those same people were like,

265
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:30,617
we like to have Popsicles
outside when it's cold.

266
00:10:30,617 --> 00:10:32,736
Doesn't that sound kind of like terrible?

267
00:10:32,736 --> 00:10:34,198
But I'm not sure if that's the case

268
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,403
for all Finns, but that is
something that they said,

269
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,494
they're like oh yeah,

270
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:39,570
we love ice cream,
- That's crazy.

271
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,685
- we love the cold, and then I thought,

272
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:43,906
- I don't do well.
- oh my gosh,

273
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:46,108
- We're the Batman in this situation

274
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:47,423
and they're Bane.

275
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,064
We merely adapted to the cold,

276
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,903
they were born in it, molded by it.

277
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:54,768
Okay sleepy Jared is so sleepy,

278
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:57,352
so sleepy Jared is gonna go to sleep.

279
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:58,848
Thank you for watching the video today.

280
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:01,505
Have a wonderful start
to your brand new week

281
00:11:01,505 --> 00:11:03,161
and we'll see you next time.

282
00:11:03,161 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
