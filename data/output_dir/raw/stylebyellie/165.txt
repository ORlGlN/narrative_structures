1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:03,500
(dramatic groovy music)

2
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:13,904
- [Ellie] Is that not the
coolest shirt you have ever seen?

3
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:14,737
Calvin's gonna wear that.

4
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:16,024
You have a cool one too.

5
00:00:16,024 --> 00:00:17,472
You have the mummy one.

6
00:00:17,472 --> 00:00:19,413
- Why do I have the mummy one?

7
00:00:19,413 --> 00:00:20,410
- 'Cause that's what you have.

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:22,019
They didn't have your size in this.

9
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:23,186
We are getting ready for the day.

10
00:00:23,186 --> 00:00:26,786
Calvin is going to have his first official

11
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,082
play date today.

12
00:00:28,082 --> 00:00:30,482
Just him and just kids his age.

13
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:32,177
Are you excited Cal?

14
00:00:32,177 --> 00:00:34,812
No, that's his personality.

15
00:00:34,812 --> 00:00:36,667
(laughs)

16
00:00:36,667 --> 00:00:38,683
It's no at first.

17
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:40,250
He doesn't want to leave his brother,

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,882
it's cute, or me.

19
00:00:41,882 --> 00:00:43,995
Okay, I gotta grab him,
and get him dressed.

20
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:45,578
- This is my dress.

21
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,784
This is my dress.

22
00:00:47,784 --> 00:00:49,423
- [Ellie] He's gonna eat your bum bum.

23
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:52,367
Calvin, did you sleep in my bed?

24
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,480
- Yeah.

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,110
- [Ellie] You did?

26
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,943
- Yeah.

27
00:00:57,865 --> 00:01:01,146
- [Jackson] I want you to say something.

28
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:03,031
- It's so cute.

29
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:03,864
Lay down, we're not done.

30
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:04,936
- [Jackson] You say something.

31
00:01:04,936 --> 00:01:07,269
- This is the cutest outfit.

32
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:09,920
(crying)

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,753
You don't think so?

34
00:01:10,753 --> 00:01:13,235
- [Jackson] Hi Calvin.

35
00:01:13,235 --> 00:01:14,068
Hi Calvin.

36
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,919
- No.

37
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:18,197
- [Ellie] You found the pocket.

38
00:01:18,197 --> 00:01:19,447
Did it eat you?

39
00:01:21,058 --> 00:01:21,899
- Yeah.

40
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:23,388
- [Ellie] Did it eat your hand?

41
00:01:23,388 --> 00:01:27,407
- [Jackson] You tell
something to our friends.

42
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:29,093
- You want me to say
something to our friends?

43
00:01:29,093 --> 00:01:30,222
Calvin there you go,

44
00:01:30,222 --> 00:01:32,139
look how cute you look.

45
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:35,741
I like that, should we go
put on your good shirt too?

46
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:37,590
- [Calvin] Daddy.

47
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,101
- [Ellie] Hello.

48
00:01:39,101 --> 00:01:39,934
(laughing)

49
00:01:39,934 --> 00:01:41,508
(drawing blinds)

50
00:01:41,508 --> 00:01:42,490
- Good morning guys,

51
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,321
so I just got out of the
shower as you can tell.

52
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,388
And I noticed something

53
00:01:46,388 --> 00:01:48,293
and I wanted to tell you about it.

54
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:50,043
I was washing my hair

55
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:54,661
and I was just using the
cheapo hotel shampoo.

56
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,381
And I was doing my hair and I was like,

57
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:59,364
oh my gosh, this does not feel

58
00:01:59,364 --> 00:02:01,173
like my hair normally does.

59
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:02,869
And then I realized it's because

60
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:04,603
I'm not using the shampoo and conditioner

61
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:05,924
that Ellie has at home.

62
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:07,617
Ellie always makes sure,
she's a cosmetologist,

63
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:10,613
so she makes sure to get the
good stuff for your hair.

64
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:13,655
And I'm just like running
my fingers through my hair,

65
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:14,882
and I'm like uh,

66
00:02:14,882 --> 00:02:17,114
and this is the first time
I've made that connection,

67
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:19,761
it's like wow, good
shampoo and conditioner

68
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:21,643
actually makes a difference.

69
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,204
So I wanted to take this opportunity

70
00:02:23,204 --> 00:02:24,740
to thank you Ellie,

71
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,172
thank you for not only taking care of me,

72
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,714
but my hair too.

73
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:29,969
- There are so many scarecrows.

74
00:02:29,969 --> 00:02:31,767
- There are so many scarecrows.

75
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:33,598
Here show me what you got.

76
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:35,864
Jackson's my little buddy today.

77
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,232
- I got bubblegum.

78
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:40,239
- You got your very
fist pack of bubblegum.

79
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,390
I used to remember eating
that in my back yard.

80
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,192
And I put it all in my mouth,
and I had too much to eat.

81
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:49,400
- I'm not gonna eat too much.

82
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,255
- Okay, you'll eat it slow, okay?

83
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,088
- Yeah.

84
00:02:53,088 --> 00:02:55,229
- Okay well Calvin's at
his little play date.

85
00:02:55,229 --> 00:02:57,500
He did so good, he just went in

86
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,549
and played with his friends.

87
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:01,357
It's cute, sometimes he
doesn't really want to,

88
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:02,861
and then sometimes he does really great

89
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,364
and today he did great.

90
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:05,694
Let's go.

91
00:03:05,694 --> 00:03:06,992
Should we go home?

92
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:07,825
- Yeah.

93
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:10,492
(playful music)

94
00:03:30,994 --> 00:03:34,001
- [Strange Voice] No pomegranates!

95
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:36,713
- What do you mean,
we're not gonna get food?

96
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,246
- I'm sorry.

97
00:03:38,246 --> 00:03:39,079
- It's okay.

98
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,131
- I'm sorry.

99
00:03:40,131 --> 00:03:41,234
- I'll go hang out with my dad.

100
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,311
- Hang out with your dad Chaz.

101
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,144
- Okay.

102
00:03:43,144 --> 00:03:43,977
- Have a good time.

103
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:45,060
See ya buddy.

104
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:49,392
- Today is the last day of VidSummit

105
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,968
and it has been awesome,

106
00:03:50,968 --> 00:03:52,807
but there's two things that I need to do

107
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,184
before we take off on our airplane today.

108
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:57,512
Aside from all the classes,
which has been awesome,

109
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,591
there's like an electric scooter here

110
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,688
that's kind of like a snowboard,

111
00:04:00,688 --> 00:04:02,095
and I need to ride that.

112
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,055
I've seen people ride it
and it's been amazing.

113
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,845
Also, number two, Garrett
from the Bucket List family

114
00:04:06,845 --> 00:04:08,466
is here, he's speaking today.

115
00:04:08,466 --> 00:04:10,442
And for the past year or so,

116
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:11,985
we have been talking
about getting together

117
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,233
and meeting up and we've never been able

118
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:15,402
to make anything work,

119
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:17,426
but we finally, I think
we're gonna be able

120
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,259
to talk today.

121
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,003
Oh look hey, hi how's it going?

122
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,404
(laughing)

123
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:25,333
I love those guys, that's
Jake Larsen and his wife.

124
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:27,405
But I think we're
finally gonna meet today,

125
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:29,560
and maybe we'll talk about
doing something together.

126
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,534
I don't know, we'll see.

127
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:33,902
- Mr. Calvin, did you have fun?

128
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:35,638
Mr. Nosepicker?

129
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:36,566
Did you have fun?

130
00:04:36,566 --> 00:04:37,546
- Yeah.

131
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,879
- Did you dance?

132
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:42,241
And did you sing?

133
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,074
Wow.

134
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,035
My friend said that he was rocking out

135
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,284
with the music.

136
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:49,084
And then they made these.

137
00:04:49,084 --> 00:04:51,580
I'm so glad you had a
fun little play date.

138
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,052
- Can I have one of those Calvin?

139
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,772
- [Ellie] You want one too?

140
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:55,738
We could share.

141
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:58,602
He has a treat that he
could share with you.

142
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:01,570
And you can share with him.

143
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,244
We need to wash our hands.

144
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,195
Sometimes we pick our noses,

145
00:05:05,195 --> 00:05:07,954
and if you just wash your
hands, that's okay right?

146
00:05:07,954 --> 00:05:10,641
We need to learn to not do that,

147
00:05:10,641 --> 00:05:12,073
he's gotten in the habit.

148
00:05:12,073 --> 00:05:12,944
- Okay I found the scooter,

149
00:05:12,944 --> 00:05:14,918
but not only that, I found the creator,

150
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:17,295
the owner, the most amazing
person in the world.

151
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:18,576
Hey, how's it going.

152
00:05:18,576 --> 00:05:19,409
- Hi.

153
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:20,242
- So this is the scooter

154
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:21,506
and you're gonna tell us
a little bit about it.

155
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,322
- Yes, this is the Scooterboard.

156
00:05:23,322 --> 00:05:24,962
It's not a scooter, it's not a skateboard,

157
00:05:24,962 --> 00:05:26,962
it's a brand new electric
rideable category,

158
00:05:26,962 --> 00:05:29,900
because it combines the standing stance

159
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,366
of a skateboard sideways,

160
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:34,945
with the scooter's handle,

161
00:05:34,945 --> 00:05:37,177
although not quite,
because it's one handed.

162
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:40,200
From a beginner, you can
ride with it in one session,

163
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,862
but with an expert,

164
00:05:41,862 --> 00:05:44,607
you can basically do a lot
more riskier moves with it.

165
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:45,440
- [Jared] Dad you hear that?

166
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,377
You can probably do this

167
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:48,112
and survive to tell the tale.

168
00:05:48,112 --> 00:05:50,362
- Yeah, if I actually had balance.

169
00:05:50,362 --> 00:05:52,114
- 15 miles per hour,

170
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:54,503
that's almost as fast as I can run Dad.

171
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:55,336
- Almost.

172
00:05:55,336 --> 00:05:56,760
- The Scooterboard is out.

173
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,137
The Sher brothers are here.

174
00:05:58,137 --> 00:05:58,970
What's up guys.

175
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,803
- What's up?

176
00:05:59,803 --> 00:06:00,636
- [Jared] So you just road it, how was it?

177
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:01,568
- I just rode it, it was awesome.

178
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:03,991
It rides like a scooter, like a snowboard

179
00:06:03,991 --> 00:06:05,231
and skateboard mixed together.

180
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,936
- Okay, I'm not good at any of those,

181
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:08,153
but I'm gonna try it.

182
00:06:08,153 --> 00:06:10,200
Okay here I go.

183
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,254
- A little bit more on the pressure.

184
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:12,193
- A little more?

185
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:13,360
Come on Jared.

186
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,887
Here we go, here we go.

187
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:18,746
Whoa whoa.

188
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:21,905
(laughing)

189
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,128
Here we go.

190
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:25,364
Okay I think I've got
it, I think I've got it.

191
00:06:25,364 --> 00:06:26,606
Take the camera.

192
00:06:26,606 --> 00:06:27,523
Here we go.

193
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:32,714
This is so nice.

194
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,166
It feels so good.

195
00:06:38,014 --> 00:06:41,164
I feel like I could go anywhere.

196
00:06:41,164 --> 00:06:42,221
Do you want to try it Dad?

197
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,699
- [Dad] I don't think so.

198
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:44,539
- I haven't found Garrett,

199
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,512
but I think I found myself in a place

200
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:47,966
where he might be.

201
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:51,398
And I found some other people around here,

202
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:53,661
some pretty cool people.

203
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:54,494
And we're all actually hanging out here,

204
00:06:54,494 --> 00:06:56,015
Garrett's actually gonna go up on stage

205
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:56,848
and we're gonna listen to him.

206
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:57,923
So I'm anxious to hear what he has to say.

207
00:06:57,923 --> 00:06:59,790
- [Speaker] If you were
able to sell your company

208
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,707
for 54 million dollars.

209
00:07:05,287 --> 00:07:07,162
- I am late for this shuttle.

210
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:08,930
Oh my goodness gracious.

211
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,001
The fire department's here.

212
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:10,834
Dad you didn't have to
call the fire department,

213
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,126
I was just in the conference, okay?

214
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,726
- That's our airport shuttle.

215
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,158
We're gonna be in a hurry.

216
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:17,408
- Oh, expedited service.

217
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:19,389
We are actually running pretty late

218
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:20,420
for our flight.

219
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:22,244
Our flight leaves in just a little bit.

220
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:24,214
But I have to tell a story about that.

221
00:07:24,214 --> 00:07:26,019
So we just finished The
Bucket List family conference

222
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:26,998
and I got to meet him.

223
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:29,034
And we've been talking
through Twitter DM's

224
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,732
off and on a little bit
for like a year now,

225
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,401
and it was cool to finally meet him.

226
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,881
And the reason that I'm late

227
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,394
to come out for the shuttle,

228
00:07:36,394 --> 00:07:38,659
is because the conference just went long.

229
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:41,495
The last couple speakers
went over on their time

230
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,023
and we're cutting it close as it is,

231
00:07:44,023 --> 00:07:45,847
and so I go up to talk
to Garrett afterwards

232
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:48,092
to say hi to him and like let's plan

233
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,697
one time when we can get together,

234
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,946
your family and our family,

235
00:07:51,946 --> 00:07:54,467
and Derral calls me up on stage.

236
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:55,300
- No!

237
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,133
- Yeah he calls me up on stage

238
00:07:56,133 --> 00:08:00,663
and he's talking about
this specific strategy

239
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:03,763
and he's like, Jared has a perfect example

240
00:08:03,763 --> 00:08:05,236
of what not to do.

241
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:07,647
And I'm like Derral, you're
throwing me under the bus.

242
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,241
And he's like, I tend to do that, don't I?

243
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:10,354
And I said yes,

244
00:08:10,354 --> 00:08:13,018
so I gave the bad example of what I did

245
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:14,970
for this YouTube strategy

246
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,197
and then went and talked Garrett,

247
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:17,176
and I came out here.

248
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:19,311
There's a fire department,
Dad's waiting for me.

249
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:20,413
We've missed one shuttle.

250
00:08:20,413 --> 00:08:21,304
We're waiting for a second shuttle.

251
00:08:21,304 --> 00:08:22,256
- We've missed two shuttles.

252
00:08:22,256 --> 00:08:25,299
- Two shuttles, oh jeez, I'm sorry Dad.

253
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:26,388
Should we call an Uber?

254
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,221
Should we call an Uber?

255
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,401
- No I think we're good.

256
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:29,782
- We're gonna go home and see our family.

257
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:30,994
Overall though, how was VidSummit?

258
00:08:30,994 --> 00:08:31,827
- Good.

259
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:32,707
- I learned a lot.

260
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,527
It was really really great
to have this experience.

261
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,039
This was my first one.

262
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,457
And if you're a creator,
a business or brand,

263
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,538
I think going to VidSummit,

264
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:42,145
you'll get more information

265
00:08:42,145 --> 00:08:44,102
than any other convention out there.

266
00:08:44,102 --> 00:08:46,199
- Well here I am at the end of the night,

267
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:47,965
the kids are in bed.

268
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:49,417
I really hardly filmed today.

269
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,246
We did lots of snuggling,

270
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:53,719
we played outside the whole
time with our friends.

271
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,621
And something that I want to capture

272
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,162
and show you but I'm gonna tell you.

273
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,840
It's so fun, every day,

274
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,497
every day at like 3:30,

275
00:09:03,497 --> 00:09:05,746
the neighborhood kids
will knock on our door.

276
00:09:05,746 --> 00:09:07,761
I finally put a sign that said knock,

277
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,594
instead of ring the door bell,

278
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:11,845
because sometimes they wake
Calvin up if he was sleeping.

279
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,986
And they always ask to ride the Segways.

280
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:16,819
And I am so glad that they think

281
00:09:16,819 --> 00:09:20,276
that it's fun and that
it's okay to come and ask.

282
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:21,817
They always ask.

283
00:09:21,817 --> 00:09:24,199
They ride the Segways and
at the end of the night,

284
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:25,056
they put 'em back.

285
00:09:25,056 --> 00:09:26,896
And it's just something fun

286
00:09:26,896 --> 00:09:29,720
that I enjoy having something

287
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,424
that like the neighborhood kids

288
00:09:31,424 --> 00:09:32,936
can come and use and play with

289
00:09:32,936 --> 00:09:34,288
because that's what they're for,

290
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:35,121
just to have fun with,

291
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,587
and Jared and I don't
use them a whole ton.

292
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:38,420
So that's fun

293
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,062
and so the kids played with their friends.

294
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:41,700
But I wanted to show you this.

295
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,372
And we have showed you
guys this 100 times,

296
00:09:43,372 --> 00:09:45,827
so if you're kind of annoyed with it,

297
00:09:45,827 --> 00:09:47,593
definitely skip this part.

298
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,214
But it's something,
it's a work in progress,

299
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,914
especially the office,

300
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:53,633
because we just have a lot of cords,

301
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:55,408
a lot of equipment,

302
00:09:55,408 --> 00:09:58,057
and so, we showed you this last time,

303
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:00,545
like our little system
and the organization

304
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:01,472
and I like it.

305
00:10:01,472 --> 00:10:03,936
This is what I worked on today.

306
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,143
These are the drones that we have

307
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:08,662
and then all of these cords

308
00:10:08,662 --> 00:10:10,203
that are in a box.

309
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:13,995
And then up here, is
just some lingering stuff

310
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:17,712
up there, I mean it's not
like crazy artsy organized,

311
00:10:17,712 --> 00:10:19,617
but it works, and it's a
lot better than it was.

312
00:10:19,617 --> 00:10:20,969
And then in this cupboard,

313
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,137
we just have tons of batteries

314
00:10:23,137 --> 00:10:25,313
and tons of chargers,

315
00:10:25,313 --> 00:10:28,188
and tons of cameras in there,

316
00:10:28,188 --> 00:10:30,788
and just all that stuff.

317
00:10:30,788 --> 00:10:33,363
All the GoPro stuff's back there.

318
00:10:33,363 --> 00:10:36,556
So it's just like organized
a little bit better.

319
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:39,571
And the biggest thing
that I did today was,

320
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,404
I got a fireproof, waterproof safe

321
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,488
and I put all of our paperwork in there,

322
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:47,800
so everything is in there,

323
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,025
and then we obviously
have a ton of house stuff,

324
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,529
like these are our house plans

325
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:55,160
and a few other house plans that we had

326
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,463
but that we didn't go with,

327
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:57,781
I have in that box.

328
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,021
So today I did a little bit of organizing

329
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:01,454
and a lot of playing with the kids.

330
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:04,787
(dramatic groovy music)

331
00:11:13,733 --> 00:11:15,289
- Rock paper scissors for the window seat.

332
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,794
- Rock paper scissors.

333
00:11:16,794 --> 00:11:17,627
Ready?

334
00:11:17,627 --> 00:11:19,508
- Best out of three?

335
00:11:19,508 --> 00:11:20,695
- Okay.

336
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:22,528
- Rock paper scissors.

337
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,302
Rock paper scissors.

338
00:11:26,302 --> 00:11:28,004
Rock paper scissors.

339
00:11:28,004 --> 00:11:28,837
Rock paper scissors.

340
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:29,670
Oh!

341
00:11:30,684 --> 00:11:32,444
(dramatic funky music)

342
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,955
You want to meet the pilot again?

343
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:34,788
- No.

344
00:11:34,788 --> 00:11:36,278
- No, you don't want to
meet the pilot this time?

345
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,111
Okay.

346
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:42,497
There's about four or five firetrucks

347
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:46,164
and a couple ambulances
outside the airport.

348
00:11:48,594 --> 00:11:52,302
(flight attendant speaking)

349
00:11:52,302 --> 00:11:54,045
- A show that Jared and I really like,

350
00:11:54,045 --> 00:11:55,511
is This is Us.

351
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:57,114
And they just came out
with their second season,

352
00:11:57,114 --> 00:11:59,938
so Jared and I have watched
a few episodes of that,

353
00:11:59,938 --> 00:12:02,274
but I feel really like I shouldn't watch

354
00:12:02,274 --> 00:12:04,354
without Jared, so I've been watching a lot

355
00:12:04,354 --> 00:12:08,408
of Parenthood and it kind
of is along the same lines

356
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:11,509
as This is Us, like the storyline.

357
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:13,133
And I really like it.

358
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:15,684
This is another show that
Jared and I would watch,

359
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:17,636
but we really like This is Us,

360
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,652
so I saved that,

361
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:19,636
and we'll watch it together.

362
00:12:19,636 --> 00:12:22,516
But I've watched 10
episodes of Parenthood.

363
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:23,372
When the kids go to bed,

364
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:27,253
I've stayed up to like one
o'clock watching Parenthood,

365
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,245
because I can't sleep.

366
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:29,847
So that's what I'm gonna watch

367
00:12:29,847 --> 00:12:30,751
until Jared gets home.

368
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:34,084
(dramatic groovy music)

369
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:42,285
- Holy crap, you can
tell we're back in Utah.

370
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:44,885
It is a blistering 40 degrees outside.

371
00:12:44,885 --> 00:12:46,829
Blistering, that's usually hot, isn't it?

372
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:47,662
- Yeah, that is.

373
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:50,408
- It's a frigid 40 degrees outside,

374
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:53,816
nearly half the temperature in California.

375
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,928
It was 80 degrees, I think, when we left,

376
00:12:55,928 --> 00:12:58,528
40 degrees here in Utah.

377
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,504
Don't worry, the only issue
we're having right now

378
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:02,624
is Dad can't find the car keys.

379
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:04,532
We'll see about the car
battery in just a minute.

380
00:13:04,532 --> 00:13:05,674
(laughing)

381
00:13:05,674 --> 00:13:06,665
Did you find the key?

382
00:13:06,665 --> 00:13:07,498
- I found the keys.

383
00:13:07,498 --> 00:13:08,969
- [Jared] Okay, let's check the battery.

384
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:11,967
Come on little car,
little car, little car.

385
00:13:11,967 --> 00:13:12,800
(car dinging)

386
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,633
Yes, we're on our way!

387
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:18,262
My sweet sweet wife.

388
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:22,065
- Oh Jared, the second time
we're reunited for you guys.

389
00:13:22,065 --> 00:13:24,386
- Yes, we're staging this.

390
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,351
(kissing)

391
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,184
- How are you?

392
00:13:26,184 --> 00:13:27,112
- Oh I'm so good.

393
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:28,439
What I said,

394
00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:29,272
I actually did say that,

395
00:13:29,272 --> 00:13:33,640
but what I said is like, it
is so good to see you smile,

396
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,968
I love you so much.

397
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,628
I do, it's true.
- I know.

398
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:38,461
- I missed you.

399
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:39,294
- That was kind of awkward
- I was only gone

400
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:40,271
- for a little bit.

401
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:42,248
- That was awkward saying
hi the second time.

402
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:44,347
It was better the first
time, if you were there.

403
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:46,973
- Yeah, you should've been there.

404
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:48,019
I've got something fun going on tomorrow.

405
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:52,232
I'm taking you shopping for
something fun tomorrow okay?

406
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:54,077
Are you excited?

407
00:13:54,077 --> 00:13:56,168
- You should be excited,
because it's exciting.

408
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,001
It's exciting.

409
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:58,037
You look like cousin It,

410
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,165
that's what you should be for Halloween.

411
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:01,229
We will se guys tomorrow.

412
00:14:01,229 --> 00:14:02,457
Thank you so much for watching.

413
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:04,019
I'm so excited to be home with my family.

414
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:05,921
- Bla bla bla bla bla bye.

415
00:14:05,921 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jared] Bye.
