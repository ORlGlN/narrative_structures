1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,009
- Well that was kind
of a scary experience.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,380
- What did Calvin just do?

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,970
What did you say about the doctor?

4
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,370
Did everybody have fun?

5
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,250
I think today's gonna be a great day.

6
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,710
Both the kids went to bed good.

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,100
They both slept through the night.

8
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,670
It's eight o'clock and
they're both still asleep.

9
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:16,590
So I get to enjoy my
breakfast all to myself?

10
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,980
Holy cow.

11
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,570
- It's like, what is life right now?

12
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,122
- [Ellie] How was your workout?

13
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,100
- I pushed myself really hard.

14
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,430
I'm in between the lines of I feel so good

15
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,440
and I'm gonna throw up.
(Ellie chuckles)

16
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,646
My hip is killing me though.

17
00:00:31,646 --> 00:00:32,604
- [Elly] Want some cereal?

18
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:33,437
- I do.

19
00:00:33,437 --> 00:00:34,540
Can I sit next to you?
- Sure.

20
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,980
Oh, it's gonna be a date.

21
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,943
Come over.

22
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:41,660
Oh, my goodness, good morning.
- Good morning.

23
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,760
- Did you know you slept so late?

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,593
- Yeah.

25
00:00:44,593 --> 00:00:46,327
♪ All through the night ♪

26
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:48,840
♪ All through the night ♪

27
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,408
- [Ellie] How's that to warm you up?

28
00:00:50,408 --> 00:00:51,870
- [Jared] Is that better?

29
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:53,460
Does that warm your arms up?

30
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,370
- [Ellie] He wanted something warm.

31
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,330
- Oh, I need something
warm to warm my arms up.

32
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:00,160
- [Ellie] Is that better?

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,210
- I made Mickey Mouse.

34
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,297
- [Ellie] That is so cool
that you could do that.

35
00:01:05,297 --> 00:01:06,320
- Yeah.

36
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,600
I'm gonna learn my letters.

37
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,150
- We are going over
your lower case letters.

38
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:15,250
Jackson has all of his
alphabet passed off at school,

39
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,640
but now we have to go over his

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,060
lower case letters, and pass those off.

41
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,660
Do you think you can pass it off today?

42
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,493
- Yeah.

43
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:23,090
- [Ellie] Okay, can you
read me the first line?

44
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,250
- E, S, M, K, T.

45
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,200
- Perfect!

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,110
You had a hard time with T this morning,

47
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,540
but I think you got it.
- Yeah.

48
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,982
- So let's try really hard
to pass those off, okay?

49
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:35,070
- Okay.
- Okay.

50
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,472
Are you excited for school?

51
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,305
- Yeah.

52
00:01:38,305 --> 00:01:40,591
- He asks every day, "Is it a school day?"

53
00:01:40,591 --> 00:01:43,100
- Yeah.
- Nope, but today is!

54
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,640
- Well, that was kind
of a scary experience.

55
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,970
You'll have to speak up, I'm
wearing a towel; don't look!

56
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,640
Okay, guys, I showed you but,

57
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,480
not now, I don't want you to look.

58
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,650
I had a little scary experience,
I got out of the shower

59
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,730
and I noticed Calvin was not
on the bed like Ellie said,

60
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:58,810
he was watching a show while
she took Jackson to school.

61
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,110
Calvin's not on the bed, that
means he's not in the room

62
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,280
where the door was closed
and locked and all that stuff

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,670
so he couldn't get out,
and then I come out

64
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,169
and I'm in my towel running
around looking for him,

65
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,887
and I see this garage door
open, and I'm thinking,

66
00:02:10,888 --> 00:02:14,190
oh, crap, like he is out, he is running.

67
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,000
So, I get out in my towel,
running through the snow,

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,300
looking for him without
looking at my phone,

69
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,400
and I'm like, oh crap,
where the heck is Calvin.

70
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,380
I'm running through the
house, after my feet are

71
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,000
just like sopping wet, and freezing cold.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,360
Luckily Ellie has him.

73
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,410
Oh, my gosh.

74
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,390
That was kinda scary.

75
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,840
I'm glad, Ellie just showed
me the video she filmed,

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,050
she just texted me,
they're laughing about it.

77
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,320
- All right, is everyone okay?

78
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,280
Calvin, are you okay?

79
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,644
What did Calvin just do?

80
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:42,894
- Went outside.

81
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,260
- Oh, my goodness.

82
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:47,710
- I'm freaking out because my kid,

83
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,720
I thought he's lost, but
he's just with Ellie.

84
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,370
Oh, my gosh, that was scary.

85
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,020
Okay, I'm gonna put some clothes on, guys.

86
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,430
Stop looking down there!

87
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,420
Jeez!

88
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,260
- Okay, you guys hold hands.

89
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,040
Momma is gonna be
walking like this, so I'm

90
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,260
still limping, guys, with
my ingrown toenail removal.

91
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,990
I've been wearing my slipper on one foot,

92
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,970
'cause it's the most wide,
comfy shoe for my toe.

93
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,360
So, I have a feeling when
I'm done with these slippers,

94
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,730
I'm gonna want some new house slippers.

95
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,610
I've never been a huge
fan of house slippers,

96
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,250
but this last year, it's been
a night and day difference.

97
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,670
I actually really love it.

98
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,160
You don't wanna eat, Calvin?

99
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,953
Dang it.

100
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,790
So, usually once a week I
like to go out with the kids

101
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,480
for lunch, just me and the
boys, and they really like

102
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,310
Chick-fil-A because they have
a play area, but it's closed.

103
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,640
But they really like Costa Vida 'cause

104
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,267
usually I let them have an orange drink.

105
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,393
- Orange drink is my favorite.

106
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,550
You're getting so big.

107
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,294
- My belly?
- Yeah.

108
00:03:43,294 --> 00:03:46,880
(Ellie laughs)
- Spice!

109
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,060
- [Ellie] Is it spicy?

110
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,920
- Yeah!

111
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,443
- [Ellie] Do you like it?

112
00:03:50,443 --> 00:03:53,840
- If it's spicy, you have to have water.

113
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,970
- [Ellie] Does your puppy
want to have a drink?

114
00:03:57,841 --> 00:03:59,240
- Don't blow it too much.

115
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,320
- Do you want me to tie
it, so you can hold it?

116
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,200
Want it bigger?
- No!

117
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,093
- Do you want it smaller?

118
00:04:09,093 --> 00:04:10,201
Is that good?
- Yeah.

119
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,001
- Do you want me to tie it?
- Yeah.

120
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,270
- You were worried about it popping.

121
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,190
Did you win it at school?
- Yes.

122
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,023
- I gotta tie it.

123
00:04:19,023 --> 00:04:22,710
I won't pop it; I gotta tie
it so the air won't come out.

124
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,543
Is that okay?

125
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,960
Bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk, bonk!

126
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,030
Are you happy with it?
- Yeah.

127
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,580
- How did you win it at school?

128
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,700
Because you were good?

129
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:35,960
- [Calvin] Hey, pink dress!

130
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,450
- I'm wearing a pink dress.
- Yeah.

131
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,250
- What did you say about the doctor?

132
00:04:42,247 --> 00:04:44,890
- The doctor really helps you.

133
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,540
- The doctor helps me, huh?

134
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,800
Yeah, we're going to our
chiropractor appointment today,

135
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,230
and Jackson said he's gonna use

136
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,530
the shockers on my back,
'cause usually she does stuff

137
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,401
to my back and sometimes he helps.

138
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,484
- What's this

139
00:04:58,018 --> 00:04:59,340
thing here?

140
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,173
- It helps with the snow.

141
00:05:00,173 --> 00:05:01,560
Will you open the door for me?

142
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Awesome!

143
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,720
Thank you, mister!

144
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,160
So, I'm waiting for my appointment

145
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,300
and the boys are just
sitting here playing.

146
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,400
I love this.

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,490
I love our days where I
take Jackson to school,

148
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,070
I pick him up, we go to lunch,

149
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:16,360
we just run our errands
together, just the two,

150
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,120
and they helped me pick out
some stuff at the store today,

151
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,370
they got Play-doh, and I got
some more pens and pencils.

152
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,680
I love this stage of life.

153
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,410
I really like having two toddlers.

154
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,130
Calvin's talking more,
they're just growing up tons,

155
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,750
and it's just.
- Hey, I want that!

156
00:05:35,107 --> 00:05:38,200
- [Ellie] And they sometimes fight.

157
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,950
Well, you want the chair,
but he's sitting there.

158
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,780
You sit on the big one.

159
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,240
You want the little chair?
- Yeah.

160
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,440
- [Ellie] Okay, will you look at me?

161
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,410
Look at Mom.

162
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,060
You sit on the big one and when he's done

163
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,940
then you sit on the little one.

164
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,800
Perfect.

165
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,580
Now we're all sitting
on chairs; this is fun.

166
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,470
But I just, I like this.

167
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,331
I like my little people,
and I like my little baby.

168
00:05:58,331 --> 00:05:59,998
- No, this one hand.

169
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:02,799
No, two!

170
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,370
- As a kid in school, and in
church, sports, activities,

171
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,920
my favorite thing to do was
learn valuable life lessons.

172
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:19,170
Skills, and things that
you could learn a few times

173
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,620
and take with you the rest of your life.

174
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,700
And Ellie is doing activity
days in our church,

175
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,030
and she does fun activities
with these girls,

176
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,090
these young women, they learn things.

177
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,510
And today, it's cool.

178
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,740
They're learning how to build
a fire in the winter time,

179
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,360
for like camping and everything.

180
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,070
So, I'm out here, it's
kinda silly, but it's funny.

181
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,570
I'm making it a little easier,

182
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,430
I'm eliminating some of the snow.

183
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,750
I shoveled off all the snow,
and I'm putting ice melt down

184
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:49,670
so they don't have too hard of a time.

185
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,930
But they're learning the skill,

186
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,470
and that's the important part.

187
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,180
Ellie grew up with her
dad as a scout master,

188
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,160
and they would do, you
know, go to activities,

189
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,060
they would learn things with their dad,

190
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,520
which I am so grateful for,
because Ellie loves this stuff.

191
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,690
She loves to be outdoors, around the fire

192
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,960
with s'mores, all that kind of stuff.

193
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,040
But it's cool to have Ellie
learn that from her dad,

194
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,320
and then teach these young
girls how to do this stuff.

195
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,130
It makes me proud that Ellie is taking on

196
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,540
this role for these young women.

197
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,380
Kinda making it a little easier for them,

198
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,350
but nonetheless, they're
learning a valuable skill

199
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,530
for when you're out in the
wilderness in the wintertime,

200
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,610
how to build a fire in a wet climate.

201
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,790
That's the hardest part, is when all

202
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,550
your stuff is wet, to build a fire.

203
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,100
So, I love you, Ellie, and
I appreciate what you do.

204
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,960
Me, on the other hand, I'm going to learn

205
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,030
a very valuable skill, and that is

206
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,357
how to free fall from an airplane.

207
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,190
Oh!

208
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,660
- All right, we have
our wood, I have my ax,

209
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,010
matches, gloves, and
the stuff for the girls.

210
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,280
I know Jared told you guys
about my little adventure today

211
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,690
with the activity girls at church.

212
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,630
We're gonna learn how to build a fire.

213
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:59,870
We're gonna learn safety
when building a fire,

214
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:03,480
and we're gonna enjoy some
hot dogs and marshmallows.

215
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,430
Mom's outta breath.

216
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,720
This is gonna be interesting;
it's a good thing

217
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,566
that I have a helper, because it's like me

218
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:13,170
and another adult, and then
we're with the girls, so,

219
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,090
it's always fun doing
activity days in church,

220
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,110
church activities with kids, but sometimes

221
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,680
it gets stressful, especially when

222
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,370
you're doing stuff like that.

223
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,203
Fire!

224
00:08:22,203 --> 00:08:24,410
First of all, look at that belly!

225
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,570
I got this shirt from
Athleta, and it's not even

226
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,299
a maternity shirt, but it
was super long and stretchy,

227
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:35,269
and it's like the most
perfect thing in the world.

228
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,150
Calvin, you okay?

229
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,710
Yeah, just a little tired.

230
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,100
I wanna show you guys, I wanna
give you a baby room update,

231
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,200
and I want some of your guys' opinions.

232
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,490
I don't think you guys
even realize how many times

233
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:50,410
you guys have helped Jared and I.

234
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,850
And not even just with, like,
room decorations and stuff,

235
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,760
but just questions that
we've had that you guys

236
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,010
have answered has been very helpful,

237
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,550
and we've been very appreciative.

238
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,740
But I know a lot of people are
gonna be excited about this.

239
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,520
So this is the baby room.

240
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,090
And we've never lived in a
house, making a baby room,

241
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:10,350
so we really can do a
little bit more to it

242
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,980
than we would, maybe, normally do in

243
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,620
the apartments we've been in.

244
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,160
So, the baby room I want
to be a little bit more

245
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,980
woodsy themed, I'm kind of
going off of the blanket

246
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,808
that my mom had made me,
so like little bears,

247
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:25,610
little woodsy characters,
and then his blanket

248
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,610
I got brown 'cause I just feel like

249
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,790
this already matches him.

250
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,800
It's just something that
I've kind of gone with,

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,480
like, how I felt, but, right here,

252
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,000
on this wall, this is a big old wall

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,020
that we are going to be doing wallpaper.

254
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:41,260
And, there's a few options
that I'm gonna show you

255
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,720
a picture of, that me and my
friend have been going over

256
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,530
kind of designing the
room, and the wallpaper

257
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:51,160
that I am drawn to, is
the more just plain, wood,

258
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,690
tall, trees, like the darker ones.

259
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,100
So, that's the one I'm going towards,

260
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,200
so what do you guys think with that?

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,470
And then, we are going
to do longer curtains

262
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,510
that go to the ground,
and then I have some

263
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,820
blackout shades coming,
so I think the curtains

264
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,520
will just be like, kinda gray like that.

265
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,110
So that wall's gonna be really fun,

266
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,820
and then we're gonna put two huge pictures

267
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,320
behind the wallpaper, so it'll
be like a wood wallpaper,

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,520
or woodsy wallpaper, and
then two huge pictures

269
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:24,310
of some characters, like a
brown bear, and another animal.

270
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,100
So, we'll have to look
at the animals and see,

271
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,420
but two big pictures right
there, and they'll be framed,

272
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,950
in wood frames, and then.

273
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,040
You okay?

274
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,560
Is that cozy?

275
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,580
And then on this wall, we are gonna do

276
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,900
two really long shelves;
I really like having

277
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,400
Jackson and Calvin's room
with shelves downstairs,

278
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,770
and having some of their
knickknacks on there.

279
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,660
So, we're gonna put two big
wood shelves right there,

280
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,137
and then right here, we're going to put

281
00:10:52,137 --> 00:10:55,530
that picture frame with
the picture of baby,

282
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,310
and we're gonna have it just right there.

283
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,430
We are going to do a huge rug in here,

284
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,670
and I've been loving rugs, I
feel like it softens the room.

285
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,640
I love having a rug in my
bedroom that has carpet,

286
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,200
and the rug downstairs that has carpet.

287
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,500
I love rugs, even on
carpet, 'cause I feel like

288
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,320
it just kind of softens the room.

289
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,820
So, we're gonna get a huge rug in here,

290
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,110
and then right here we're gonna do

291
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,920
a big wood stump

292
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,570
for my side table.

293
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,300
And I'll just put my
water bottle on there,

294
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,390
and a little bowl with crackers and stuff.

295
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,810
Usually, when I nurse,
that's where I want it.

296
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,740
I think that's gonna be so cute.

297
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,020
George, you'll stay right there, mister,

298
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:35,680
and usually I just find a little
basket for the kid's room,

299
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,210
to have knickknack and
toys, like the baby's toys

300
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,370
will go in the little basket
that we could put right here.

301
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,860
So a cutesy little basket,
and I think that's about it.

302
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,650
I think that will complete
his room, and then we'll

303
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:50,980
kind of move on to Jackson
and Calvin's and kinda

304
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,890
spruce it up a little bit for them.

305
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,191
Have you been liking
sharing a room with Jackson?

306
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:56,024
- Yeah.

307
00:11:56,024 --> 00:11:58,900
- You guys have been, our life has been,

308
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,450
night and day difference, like,

309
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,620
both boys sleep through the night.

310
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,970
They cuddle, they laugh,
they've been doing really good.

311
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,480
And if they didn't do
good, then I would just

312
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,730
separate them, but I wanted to try it out,

313
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,240
because I always loved sharing
a room with my siblings.

314
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,032
Did you just stick your
tongue out to them?

315
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,520
(laughs)

316
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,320
So they've been really enjoying that,

317
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,550
so I'm excited to spruce
that room up, too.

318
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,160
Okay, should we go out?
- Yeah.

319
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,380
- Okay.

320
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,820
I'm really excited to
get this room together.

321
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,660
I obviously love having a picture of Jesus

322
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,110
in the kids' rooms; I
think that this was such

323
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,260
a sweet picture, I picked that out.

324
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,900
This was picked out
specifically for Calvin,

325
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,130
so I think when baby comes, we'll have

326
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,810
to find a picture for, for baby,

327
00:12:44,908 --> 00:12:46,980
and then this will go into Calvin's room

328
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,203
because this is Calvin's picture.

329
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:51,786
(upbeat music)

330
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:57,180
Did everybody have fun?
- Yeah!

331
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,420
- Everyone had fun?

332
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,534
Did you have fun, Calvin?
- Yeah!

333
00:13:00,534 --> 00:13:01,640
- Yeah!

334
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,768
We had fun outside,

335
00:13:02,768 --> 00:13:05,685
(children yelling)

336
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:09,090
Calvin's going, "Choc, hot dog, choc!"

337
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,240
Eating chocolate s'mores
and roasting hot dogs.

338
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,648
I had a blast.

339
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:16,470
Having nine girls over, trying to learn

340
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,100
how to chop wood and
build a fire is not easy.

341
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,120
I was impressed by them, and we

342
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,210
got it done, and it was so fun.

343
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,800
Thank you guys, so much for watching.

344
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,900
The kids are singing in the tub right now.

345
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,190
I am so excited about the nursery

346
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,170
and all the fun things
that we're gonna be doing.

347
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,930
I can't wait to read your guys' responses

348
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,880
of your opinions of what items to get,

349
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,410
maybe for each spot, so thank you guys,

350
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:46,790
so much for watching, and
we will see you tomorrow.

351
00:13:46,790 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
