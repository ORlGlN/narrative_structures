- [Jared] Look at that tree.

32
00:02:08,803 --> 00:02:11,433
- I walked on the ship cheering

33
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:12,774
and I asked everybody,

34
00:02:12,774 --> 00:02:14,343
how come not everybody is screaming,

35
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,535
this is beautiful.

36
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,001
- [Jared] This is stinking gorgeous.

37
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,742
Like look at the chandeliers.

38
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:19,575
Oh my gosh.

39
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:21,955
- So I myself cheered, how wonderful.

40
00:02:21,955 --> 00:02:22,846
- Are you boys ready?

41
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:23,679
- Uh-huh.

42
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:24,611
- We don't tell them to do that either.

43
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:25,875
- [Jared] He just does it.

44
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:27,958
Okay show us the way Mom.

45
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:31,514
Go ahead boys.
- There you go boys.

46
00:02:31,514 --> 00:02:33,336
- What the?
- In you go Daddy.

47
00:02:33,336 --> 00:02:36,482

48
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:37,918

00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:39,404

00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:46,130
Look.

54
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:50,701
How do we get out?

55
00:02:51,884 --> 00:02:53,046
Woo!

56
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:54,811

00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,212
- [Jared] Look guys,
it's our own little deck.

59
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:01,295
- Oh my gosh.

60
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,056
This is the best.

61
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,377
This is the best one on the ship.

62
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,610
- [Jared] Best day ever.

63
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,954
- We're gonna be able to
see so much from here.

64
00:03:11,954 --> 00:03:13,112
- [Jared] Oh my gosh this is incredible.

65
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,759
- Why are we not moving?

66
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,592
- We're not moving yet.

67
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,437
It's not time to go.

68
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:19,211
- Jared] Everyone's
gotta get on board first.

69
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,950
- Mecham family cruise, go!

70
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,563
(howling)

71
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,941
(laughing)

72
00:03:25,941 --> 00:03:28,524
(bright music)

73
00:03:33,521 --> 00:03:34,354
- Yay!

74
00:03:42,112 --> 00:03:46,414
♫ Clap your hands, it's time to go

75
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,919
♫ Clap your hands.

76
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:51,568
We just pushed off, we're moving.

77
00:03:51,568 --> 00:03:54,250
It doesn't feel like it, but we are.

78
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,179
Ellie, this is our very first cruise.

79
00:03:57,179 --> 00:03:58,012
Isn't this wonderful?
- Yay.

80
00:03:58,012 --> 00:03:59,543
- It's beautiful.

81
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,586
- [Jared] It is beautiful.

82
00:04:00,586 --> 00:04:04,513
Even though it's cloudy
out, it's beautiful.

83
00:04:04,513 --> 00:04:07,096
(lively music)

84
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,137
Look at these beds.

85
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,573
- No, my Mickey.

86
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:17,073
So cool, I'm sleeping up here.

87
00:04:18,557 --> 00:04:21,196
- [Jared] Look at the stars, Jackson.

88
00:04:21,196 --> 00:04:24,113
- Look, you climb up these ladders.

89
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,422
You climb up the ladders.

90
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,955
I can sleep up

91
00:04:32,955 --> 00:04:34,205
Let's try this.

92
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:36,412
What?

93
00:04:36,412 --> 00:04:38,079
I can see the stars!

94
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:41,998
(bright music)

95
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:44,081
- Good morning guys,

96
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,906
welcome to another beautiful day at sea.

97
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:49,442
Today we are meeting a lot of fun people

98
00:04:49,442 --> 00:04:51,131
and seeing a lot of great things.

99
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:53,305
The kids are wearing their costumes

100
00:04:53,305 --> 00:04:54,673
and they are just adorable.

101
00:04:54,673 --> 00:04:57,402
Calvin, are you dressed up as Woody today?

102
00:04:57,402 --> 00:04:58,416
- Woody.

103
00:04:58,416 --> 00:04:59,249
- [Jared] Yeah.

104
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:02,312
Are you excited to go
meet some cool people?

105
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:03,611
Uh-oh we're locked out.

106
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,760
So I know that you have seen the room,

107
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,222
but I don't feel like we've
done a proper room tour.

108
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:08,780
So that is what I'm gonna do right now.

109
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,289
You guys just saw what it
looks like on the outside.

110
00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:12,658
It's gorgeous, it's amazing.

111
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,478
But I want to show you this.

112
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,889
You just got like a cool desk feature

113
00:05:16,889 --> 00:05:19,759
with lots of storage space, drawers,

114
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,127
a TV, a giant mirror.

115
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:24,575
Then we've got this couch that folds

116
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:25,814
yeah, it's a cool bed.

117
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:28,284
It's a couch that folds down into a bed.

118
00:05:28,284 --> 00:05:29,604
And as you saw,

119
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:32,521
- That one turns into a ladder bed.

120
00:05:33,913 --> 00:05:36,245
- [Jared] That's right, this comes down

121
00:05:36,245 --> 00:05:37,260
into a bunk bed.

122
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,391
Is that where your slept?

123
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:41,160
- Uh-huh, I slept up there.
- That is so cool.

124
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,566
- [Jared] Yes you did, did you like it.

125
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,710
- I want to sleep up there.

126
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,556
- [Jared] Yeah.

127
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:49,025
Then, this is our bed,
which is super comfy.

128
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,792
Got a couple lights over there.

129
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:53,832
Underneath the bed is plenty
of storage for suitcases.

130
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,233
We've got a couple doors
right here, I'll show you.

131
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:57,708
The first one is like a

132
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,237
- Is a shower.

133
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:02,219
- [Jared] Yeah, it's a shower with also,

134
00:06:02,219 --> 00:06:03,052
there's like a tub,

135
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:04,697
so you can bathe the kids inside of there.

136
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,850
You can get ready in here and everything

137
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,842
and nice full size mirror.

138
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:11,002
Then we've got this one right here.

139
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:12,242
Oh hi.
- That one's the toilet.

140
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:13,844
- Hello.

141
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:14,677
- [Jared] Oh eww, hi.

142
00:06:14,677 --> 00:06:16,037
- Come in here.

143
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:18,588
- [Jared] This is the toilet room.

144
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,056
And for how like

145
00:06:20,056 --> 00:06:20,889
- I'm going potty.

146
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,217
- Gor how small you might think it is,

147
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,025
it's really quite spacious.

148
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:26,664
Like I'm really impressed.

149
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:27,772
- I'm going potty.

150
00:06:27,772 --> 00:06:29,113
- We're gonna go potty.

151
00:06:29,113 --> 00:06:31,412
- [Jared] Then you've got closets in here,

152
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,932
a full size one there.

153
00:06:33,932 --> 00:06:36,719
And then two right here, half size

154
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,682
with some storage underneath
that we are utilizing,

155
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:43,443
and then your life jackets
and the emergencies.

156
00:06:43,443 --> 00:06:46,531
All in all, I'm super
happy with this room.

157
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,108
It's bigger than I thought.

158
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,371
It's gorgeous.

159
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:51,947
The water outside is absolutely amazing

160
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:54,387
and we are just getting started.

161
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:55,650
We're gonna have a blast.

162
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,567
- Hi hi hi.

163
00:06:57,747 --> 00:06:58,869
I'm a mouse.

164
00:06:58,869 --> 00:07:00,855
- [Ellie] Excuse me, we
have Mickey in the house.

165
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:04,319
Mickey's trying to say hi to Buzz.

166
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,188
Buzz, you're trying to shoot Mickey.

167
00:07:06,188 --> 00:07:07,368
Oh no.

168
00:07:07,368 --> 00:07:10,035
(uptempo music)

169
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:20,671
(playful jazzy music)

170
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,065
- [Jared] Are you excited?

171
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:23,898
- Yeah.

172
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:28,985
- [ Ellie] Go say hi.

173
00:07:28,985 --> 00:07:30,385
- [Jared] Go say hi.

174
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:32,457
- Guess who's here, it's you

175
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,624
and it's Buzz.

176
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:36,225
Yeah.

177
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:38,083
- [Jared] Where's your hat?

178
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,600
- [Ellie] Do you want your hat Cal?

179
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,228
- There it is.

180
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,257
You know I met them earlier.

181
00:07:43,257 --> 00:07:44,090
- Hi.

182
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:50,776
Whoa.

183
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,372
- We're twins.

184
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,037
- [Ellie] One more hug before you go?

185
00:07:54,037 --> 00:07:54,870
- [Jared] One more hug.

186
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,787
- [Ellie] One more hug.

187
00:07:58,365 --> 00:08:01,575
- [Jared] Give him a hug Cal.

188
00:08:01,575 --> 00:08:02,414
- So long boys.

189
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:03,414
- Thank you.

190
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:08,006
Woo!

191
00:08:08,006 --> 00:08:10,173
Did you get to see Woody?

192
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,763
(lively piano music)

193
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,184
Woo!

194
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:31,548
- [Jared] Are you ready
to meet Buzz Light year?

195
00:08:31,548 --> 00:08:34,048
(laser beams)

196
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:37,422
- Hey Buzz, I'm you.

197
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:42,130
- [Ellie] Say thank you.

198
00:08:42,131 --> 00:08:43,298
Oh, thank you.

199
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,084
See you later Buzz.

200
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:48,204
- [Jared] Bye Buzz.

201
00:08:48,204 --> 00:08:49,704
- [Ellie] Be safe.

202
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,999
(lively piano music)

203
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:04,842
- [Jared] Yay!

204
00:09:06,155 --> 00:09:06,988
Woo!

205
00:09:08,474 --> 00:09:10,474
Okay, let's go this way.

206
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,984
- It's sparkly down here.

207
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,964
- [Ellie] It's sparkly down here.

208
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:22,464
Look at the floor.

209
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:25,061
Hi five friend.

210
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:29,551
This is our awesome waiter this week.

211
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:30,565
He's so nice.

212
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:31,398
- He is so nice and awesome.

213
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,205
- It is formal night,

214
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:35,355
so we are all dressed up.

215
00:09:35,355 --> 00:09:36,998
And we are here.

216
00:09:36,998 --> 00:09:38,853
Everybody is arriving.

217
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:39,980
- I'll put you here.

218
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,526
- [Ellie] Perfect.

219
00:09:41,526 --> 00:09:42,384
- There's a screen very close to it.

220
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,615
- Nice.
- Perfect.

221
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:46,445
- You are awesome.

222
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,081
- I put the kids in the corner,

223
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,302
so they can see the shows and everything.

224
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:50,838
- This is our table.

225
00:09:50,838 --> 00:09:54,797
The Disney cruise is
absolutely so organized

226
00:09:54,797 --> 00:09:58,236
and every, there's details everywhere.

227
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:01,806
And what has amazed me is
how clean everything is.

228
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:03,660
They don't allow kids or even adults

229
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,139
to walk into the dining area
without washing your hands.

230
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,972
There are stations all over the cruise

231
00:10:08,972 --> 00:10:10,315
to wash your hands.

232
00:10:10,315 --> 00:10:11,155
They keep it very clean.

233
00:10:11,155 --> 00:10:12,761
You can come.

234
00:10:12,761 --> 00:10:13,794
Say hi to the world.

235
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:14,627
- Hi.
- Hi.

236
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,192
(laughs)

237
00:10:17,192 --> 00:10:19,064
- Yeah everything is very clean.

238
00:10:19,064 --> 00:10:20,634
- Chocolate milk.

239
00:10:20,634 --> 00:10:23,375
- [Ellie] Yes, say thank you.

240
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,991
They knew that the kids
love chocolate milk.

241
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,791
So we have the same
waiter for the whole week

242
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,815
and he is awesome.

243
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:30,648
- Hi.
- See?

244
00:10:30,648 --> 00:10:32,023
- [Ellie] How awesome is he?

245
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:32,856
Thank you.

246
00:10:34,044 --> 00:10:35,505
- Check out the menu Ellie.

247
00:10:35,505 --> 00:10:36,588
Look at this.

248
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,493
Does it show?
- So fun.

249
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:40,326
- [Ellie] Yes.

250
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:42,198
- [Jared] Don't you do it.

251
00:10:42,198 --> 00:10:43,603
Don't you do it.

252
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,169
- [Ellie] Not quite, oh it worked.

253
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:46,063
(laughing)

254
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:46,896
- [Waiter] Made it.

255
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,900
- [Ellie] Got him.

256
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,086
- What just happened?

257
00:10:49,086 --> 00:10:50,110
- [On Screen] If you're totally ready

258
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,908
to have a righteous time
with the cross man, say cha.

259
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:53,908
- [All] Cha.

260
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,112
- [Ellie] Who's that?

261
00:10:58,112 --> 00:10:59,559
- A fish.

262
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:02,799
- We have the same hair color dude.

263
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,591
Quite nice, yeah, turtle wax, nice nice.

264
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:09,016
- It's like a theater that people stand on

265
00:11:09,016 --> 00:11:11,432
and they sing and they dance

266
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:13,496
and they act out a play.

267
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:14,999
Do you know what play we're gonna go see?

268
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:15,832
- Yeah.

269
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:18,472
- It's called Aladdin.

270
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:20,503
- At a movie theater?

271
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,765
- It's kind of like a movie theater,

272
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:24,022
but it's people actually
moving and dancing.

273
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,797
It's not a screen, it's
people, real people.

274
00:11:26,797 --> 00:11:29,278
That's the thing about this Disney cruise,

275
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,348
we've only been here
for like one full day,

276
00:11:31,348 --> 00:11:34,531
two days, this is our
second day on the boat,

277
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,899
and I've been trying to figure out a way

278
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:37,515
to describe how we've been feeling,

279
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:39,291
how things have been.

280
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,131
And honestly, magical is the best way.

281
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:44,299
Everything from the waiters at dinner

282
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:47,043
to the room, to the activities,

283
00:11:47,043 --> 00:11:48,960
it's just been magical.

284
00:11:49,803 --> 00:11:50,924
And we're gonna go see a play,

285
00:11:50,924 --> 00:11:52,570
it's this first play of the night

286
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,403
and it's Aladdin.

287
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:54,346
- Are we going somewhere?

288
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,439
- [Jared] Yeah, we're
gonna go watch the play.

289
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:57,463
Guess what?

290
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:00,398
There's a genie in this one.

291
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:02,565
- Uh is there a boy prince

292
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:06,302
and there's a princess of the girl?

293
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:08,249
- [Jared] Yes that's right.

294
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:10,203
- Why is it called that?

295
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,707
- The boy's name is Aladdin.

296
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:13,772
- No it's the prince.

297
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:16,256
- [Jared] Well he wants to be a prince.

298
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,945
That's the whole story.

299
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,641
Let's go, high five.

300
00:12:19,641 --> 00:12:20,808
One two three.

301
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,149
- [All] Tra la la!

302
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,800
- Are we having a good
family Mecham vacation?

303
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,633
- Yes.

304
00:12:29,633 --> 00:12:31,623
- Okay, one two three.

305
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,790
(howling)

306
00:12:34,752 --> 00:12:36,456
(laughing)

307
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,922
- [Jared] You got your popcorn?

308
00:12:37,922 --> 00:12:39,299
- Yes.

309
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,402
- This is beautiful.

310
00:12:40,402 --> 00:12:41,625
- This is beautiful.

311
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,136
This is the stage.

312
00:12:43,136 --> 00:12:43,969
Look at this.

313
00:12:43,969 --> 00:12:45,634
It can fit tons of people.

314
00:12:45,634 --> 00:12:46,744
- Where should we sit?

315
00:12:46,744 --> 00:12:48,144
- I think we should sit
up front on the higher.

316
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:48,977
- -Ellie] Okay.

317
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:51,310
- [On TV] We're out of here.

318
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,054
- We are just sitting here on the veranda.

319
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:58,072
I feel so weird saying that, veranda.

320
00:12:58,072 --> 00:12:59,887
- The kids are watching the show

321
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:01,879
like they do every night on the bunk bed.

322
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:03,797
- It's so sweet to see
them on the bunk bed

323
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:05,733
just watching, like how cute is that.

324
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,333
But we are admiring the beauty of nature.

325
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:10,693
There's a thunderstorm
just miles and miles away

326
00:13:10,693 --> 00:13:12,447
and we've been sitting
out here watching it.

327
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,085
And we want to show you
a little bit about that,

328
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:16,085
before we end the night.

329
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,703
Woo.

330
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:27,103
Come on, give me a good one.

331
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:27,936
- [Ellie] That's it.

332
00:13:27,936 --> 00:13:29,750
- That was such a tiny one.

333
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,393
So tomorrow morning is
our first day at port

334
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,231
and we're so excited.

335
00:13:33,231 --> 00:13:35,261
We've got a beach day
with the whole family

336
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,766
and we cannot wait.

337
00:13:36,766 --> 00:13:39,079
Ellie, so far on the scale of one to 10,

338
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,855
how would you say this cruise has been?

339
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:43,223
- This has been by far a 10.

340
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:46,156
I'm trying to think of like
the sweetest moments today,

341
00:13:46,156 --> 00:13:47,674
there were so many.

342
00:13:47,674 --> 00:13:49,129
- I think the kids meeting the characters

343
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,603
was like the funnest part.

344
00:13:50,603 --> 00:13:51,625
- And walking around in their costumes

345
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,797
and everyone awing over them.

346
00:13:53,797 --> 00:13:54,863
Everyone thought they were so cute.

347
00:13:54,863 --> 00:13:56,358
- People wanted their autographs.

348
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:57,191
It was so fun.

349
00:13:57,191 --> 00:13:58,581
Gosh Aladdin was great too.

350
00:13:58,581 --> 00:14:00,853
Oh of course, there was
a really great thunder

351
00:14:00,853 --> 00:14:02,099
and lightning strike
and we just missed it.

352
00:14:02,099 --> 00:14:05,026
- The kids absolutely
loved the live Aladdin.

353
00:14:05,026 --> 00:14:07,600
Calvin just stood there
the whole time and pointed

354
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,728
and loved it.

355
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:09,561
- Yeah exactly.

356
00:14:09,561 --> 00:14:12,391
- I just aww, our kids are so sweet,

357
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,750
it's been amazing.

358
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,470
And they both slept in the
bunk bed all night long.

359
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,607
- Which is huge for us.

360
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,478
This is a huge improvement.

361
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:22,710
- We all slept 'til 9:00 AM.

362
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,848
It was crazy.
- Unheard of.

363
00:14:24,848 --> 00:14:25,681
- So tomorrow.
- Tomorrow

364
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,728
- we're gonna try and repeat that, okay?

365
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:30,200
So thanks for watching and
we'll see you guys tomorrow.

366
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,184
Bye.
