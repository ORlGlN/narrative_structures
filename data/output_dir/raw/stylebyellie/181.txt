1
00:00:01,405 --> 00:00:03,188
- [Ellie] It was a day of healing.

2
00:00:03,188 --> 00:00:04,562
(light, peaceful music)

3
00:00:04,562 --> 00:00:07,151
- [Jared] Life throws curve balls at us,

4
00:00:07,151 --> 00:00:10,401
and we never know what we're gonna get.

5
00:00:13,198 --> 00:00:16,448
(slow, peaceful music)

6
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,508
How much do you love me?

7
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:35,400
- A lot.
- Do you love me so much?

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,896
- You're smiling, so I
don't know what's up.

9
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:40,245
- [Jared] Just look here real quick, 'k?

10
00:00:40,245 --> 00:00:41,574
- [Ellie] It's gonna make me beautiful?

11
00:00:41,574 --> 00:00:42,979
(gasping)

12
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:45,416
- [Jared] Ellie, I did it.

13
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,192
You have curly eyebrows,

14
00:00:47,192 --> 00:00:49,107
or wavy.
- They're actually kinda cute.

15
00:00:49,107 --> 00:00:50,878
(Jared laughing)

16
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:52,103
- [Jared] Thanks Snapchat!

17
00:00:52,103 --> 00:00:53,756
- [Ellie] I don't know
what I love watching more,

18
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:56,751
the two little ones running
wild in the backyard,

19
00:00:56,751 --> 00:00:59,591
climbing rocks, eating snacks, Lincoln.

20
00:00:59,591 --> 00:01:01,152
(giggling)

21
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:02,260
What are you doin'?

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,367
Or Penny bein' so happy.
- You're crazy.

23
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:07,298
- [Ellie] She just chased
a butterfly and it,

24
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:09,048
I think, made our entire week.

25
00:01:09,048 --> 00:01:10,544
(both laughing)

26
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:13,716
When she gets excited she just goes crazy.

27
00:01:13,716 --> 00:01:16,966
(slow, peaceful music)

28
00:01:44,231 --> 00:01:47,082
- Today is recovery day
number two for Ellie,

29
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:49,793
and I've made very strict rules for her

30
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:52,032
not to lift her fingers too much,

31
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:54,441
that is enforced by me and
a little bit of the doctor,

32
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:56,803
but she's not following
those rules very well.

33
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:58,266
She's been doing laundry and I'm like

34
00:01:58,266 --> 00:02:01,227
Ellie, I will do that, I
promise, let me get to that,

35
00:02:01,227 --> 00:02:03,105
just hang out and rest.

36
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:05,508
One of the things that we wanna
do while she's resting is,

37
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,886
Joel and the kids and
Bonnie are over here,

38
00:02:07,886 --> 00:02:09,507
and we have this giant painting

39
00:02:09,507 --> 00:02:11,712
that Ellie's friend painted for us,

40
00:02:11,712 --> 00:02:13,970
and we're gonna hang it up on this wall.

41
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:16,604
That's gonna be difficult because

42
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:20,429
this ground is not even,
and it's a giant painting.

43
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:23,183
Luckily we have an expandable ladder

44
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,100
that should help a huge part of that,

45
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,124
so this may be great,
this may be terrible,

46
00:02:28,124 --> 00:02:30,887
but some way or another
it's gonna be done.

47
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,283
I've got Joel at my side so
I think it's gonna be okay.

48
00:02:33,283 --> 00:02:35,959
- We'll get it, broken
banister or not, we'll get it.

49
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,379
(Calvin panting)

50
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:39,336
(Ellie giggling)

51
00:02:39,336 --> 00:02:42,900
- [Ellie] My cousin made me a
whole batch of cinnamon rolls,

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,626
and this is probably my sixth
one in the last three days,

53
00:02:46,626 --> 00:02:48,245
love it.

54
00:02:48,245 --> 00:02:49,104
That looks great.
- Okay,

55
00:02:49,104 --> 00:02:52,271
so this is the top and the bottom-ish,

56
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,365
does that feel like good height?

57
00:02:55,365 --> 00:02:58,598
- [Ellie] I would rather
have it lower than we think,

58
00:02:58,598 --> 00:03:01,134
just because everything
else is always lower

59
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:04,506
than I think in the house,
and that's how we were taught.

60
00:03:04,506 --> 00:03:06,605
- And it's better.
- And we are pretty short.

61
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:08,777
- [Ellie] Yeah, but it's a huge painting,

62
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:10,307
that looks good right there.

63
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:12,454
- Okay, are you sure
you want this painting?

64
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:14,398
- Yes.
- 'K, 'cause once I drill this

65
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:16,944
there's no goin' back.
- That's okay.

66
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:17,860
- 'K.

67
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,131
Now are you sure, is there anything?

68
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:23,592
- I want it up there.
- Yeah, but do you want me

69
00:03:23,592 --> 00:03:25,681
to do this or do you want Joel to do it?

70
00:03:25,681 --> 00:03:27,265
- Well, I don't know.
- Ellie come on,

71
00:03:27,265 --> 00:03:29,599
we're gonna do it, okay?
- Okay do it,

72
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,477
it's taken two hours.

73
00:03:31,477 --> 00:03:34,136
- [Bonnie] That seems very to-the-side.

74
00:03:34,136 --> 00:03:36,026
- [Joel] Hey, your
commentary is not necessary.

75
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,761
- [Jared] That didn't
feel like a stud at all.

76
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:39,793
- [Bonnie] Well that's why I was like, uh.

77
00:03:39,793 --> 00:03:42,912
- Joel did the measurements.

78
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,675
- I did the math, Jared
put 'em on the wall.

79
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:45,871
(laughing)

80
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:49,091
There could be a mistranslation somewhere.

81
00:03:49,091 --> 00:03:50,274
- Let's take a look at this,

82
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:52,659
we're gonna regroup for
a second, hold please.

83
00:03:52,659 --> 00:03:53,945
- Back to the drawing board.

84
00:03:53,945 --> 00:03:57,278
(light, peaceful music)

85
00:04:11,108 --> 00:04:12,988
- I felt like that was
Michelangelo's painting,

86
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:14,905
The Father and the Son.

87
00:04:15,745 --> 00:04:17,412
- [Joel] Hold, hold.

88
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,872
I like your, uh,

89
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:21,480
- [Jared] Power stance?

90
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,090
- [Joel] (laughing) Yeah,
your figure, it's really good.

91
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,529
(laughing)

92
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,518
(power drill grinding)

93
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,668
- Hey.
- Nice.

94
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,834
- Now let's hang it, got it.

95
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:34,334
- Hey Jared, how's it hangin'?

96
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:37,155
It's not, it's not yet.

97
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:40,488
(light, peaceful music)

98
00:04:53,246 --> 00:04:55,410
- Well things have finally
settled down around here,

99
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,919
and we have the painting finally hung

100
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,183
and I wanna show you, in all its glory,

101
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:03,250
it actually does look really,
really cool in the room.

102
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,205
How many people did it take to hang that?

103
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,573
It is big, it is very big, but
it's actually really light.

104
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:11,010
It's really secure, we have
some other stuff on the bottom

105
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,583
so nothing can separate it from the wall,

106
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,059
natural stuff I guess.

107
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:17,763
But I just think it looks
really, really nice,

108
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:21,338
the way the lights hit the
gold frame just make it shine,

109
00:05:21,338 --> 00:05:24,014
it's just really cool and
Ellie is going to love it,

110
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:26,335
and I think it's just gonna
be a really nice piece to have

111
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,645
for our entire lives.

112
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:31,945
It's an original piece of
artwork, that's so cool to me.

113
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:35,612
- It is 5:30, and Jackson
fell asleep on me,

114
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:41,789
and drooled all over.

115
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:44,289
I fell asleep in Jackson's bed

116
00:05:45,927 --> 00:05:50,256
because Calvin fell asleep
in my bed and was snoring.

117
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:54,256
Jackson came and found
me and fell asleep on me.

118
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:59,663
So cute, we're all gonna
stay up late tonight.

119
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,451
Jackson's over there.

120
00:06:01,451 --> 00:06:03,656
- I've never been one to really take naps,

121
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:06,096
like on Sunday afternoons
I don't usually take naps,

122
00:06:06,096 --> 00:06:09,233
and throughout our whole
marriage I've never napped

123
00:06:09,233 --> 00:06:11,863
all that often, I think
I can count on one hand

124
00:06:11,863 --> 00:06:13,084
how many times I've napped.

125
00:06:13,084 --> 00:06:16,620
I think I just now realized
how much of a physical toll

126
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,967
this week has taken on our whole family.

127
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:24,186
After we hung the picture,
Calvin went to our bedroom

128
00:06:24,186 --> 00:06:25,759
and fell asleep on the bed.

129
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,616
Ellie fell asleep downstairs,

130
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:29,809
Jackson cuddled up right next to her,

131
00:06:29,809 --> 00:06:33,123
and fell asleep next to
her, and I was on the couch

132
00:06:33,123 --> 00:06:34,769
thinking, wow, everyone's asleep.

133
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,319
And then suddenly the next
thing I knew, I woke up.

134
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:38,359
(chuckling)

135
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:42,526
It's just interesting, the
kids are being close to us,

136
00:06:43,506 --> 00:06:46,041
and I like that, and it's been really nice

137
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,113
to be able to spend time with family,

138
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:50,713
to go through all this together.

139
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:53,389
And I think tonight we have something fun

140
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:54,962
that we can do as a family,

141
00:06:54,962 --> 00:06:56,667
that will bring us close together,

142
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:00,358
and warm not only our
bodies, but our hearts.

143
00:07:00,358 --> 00:07:03,775
(light, uplifting music)

144
00:08:24,718 --> 00:08:27,208
- I'm doin' it myself,
up and down, up and down,

145
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:28,771
I'm going up and down.

146
00:08:28,771 --> 00:08:33,058
Up and down, up and down,
up and down, up and down.

147
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:35,026
- Do you like it Calvin?

148
00:08:35,027 --> 00:08:37,493
(laughing)

149
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:42,113
Today is the very first day
that we have used our fire pit.

150
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:45,171
It's a chilly day today, in
fact today's the chilliest day

151
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:47,904
of the year so far, after summer.

152
00:08:47,904 --> 00:08:50,347
So we thought today
would be the perfect day

153
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:53,522
to end our weekend and to
have a little family time.

154
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:56,939
(light, uplifting music)

155
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,583
Give me your best Captain Underpants.

156
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:18,583
- Tra-la-la!

157
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:20,632
- Tra-la-la!

158
00:09:22,557 --> 00:09:23,557
- Tra-la-la!

159
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,064
- Tra-la-la!

160
00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:28,074
Can you do it Calvin?

161
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:29,593
Say tra-la-la.

162
00:09:29,593 --> 00:09:31,012
(Calvin yelling)

163
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:33,304
(all giggling)

164
00:09:33,304 --> 00:09:34,744
Come here boys,

165
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:36,827
gimme kisses.
- Goodnight.

166
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:40,876
Kisses goodnight.

167
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:41,876
- Goodnight.

168
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,482
Goodnight, I love you.

169
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:51,188
- Today literally felt like
it was a day of healing,

170
00:09:51,188 --> 00:09:53,649
with us being outside and the fire going,

171
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:58,118
it was cold outside, just
cuddling with the kids.

172
00:09:58,118 --> 00:09:59,789
We're together all the time,

173
00:09:59,789 --> 00:10:02,697
but especially the last
few days it's like,

174
00:10:02,697 --> 00:10:04,148
we haven't been on the computers,

175
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:06,142
we haven't been doing emails,

176
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,604
we've just been laying with each other,

177
00:10:08,604 --> 00:10:10,653
sitting with each other,
eating with each other,

178
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:12,452
it's just been very nice.

179
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:15,922
- The moments together
have been much more,

180
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:16,755
- With each other.

181
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:18,673
- Yes.
- Like quality time,

182
00:10:18,673 --> 00:10:22,273
and that's been really nice,
and I've just been thinking,

183
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:24,743
life throws curve balls at us,

184
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:27,396
and we never know what we're gonna get.

185
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:31,563
But if we have a strong
foundation in family, friends,

186
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:36,218
faith, whatever it may
be, we can get through

187
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,133
anything.
- It helps a lot more.

188
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:42,116
- Yeah, and I feel so
grateful that we have that,

189
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:45,602
and I feel like the support we've had,

190
00:10:45,602 --> 00:10:48,272
the knowledge we have,
everything has been so helpful

191
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,589
throughout this week.

192
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,768
Like Ellie said, it's just
been a nice day of healing.

193
00:10:53,768 --> 00:10:55,936
- Just being together.
- Yeah.

194
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:59,023
- I feel, I didn't think
that today would be

195
00:10:59,023 --> 00:11:03,392
as hard as it was, I
definitely need to go lay down.

196
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:05,616
- You did much more than you should have.

197
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:06,499
- Well, and I didn't feel

198
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:07,332
like I did,
- Shame on you.

199
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,250
well I don't feel like I did, you know?

200
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,417
I didn't.
- I know, I just,

201
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,800
when the days comes at ya.
- I tried not to be,

202
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,191
I tried to just...
- You were cute,

203
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,700
is what you were doin',
you were helpin' out

204
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,861
around the house.

205
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:21,516
- I did like one thing.

206
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:22,536
Okay bye.

207
00:11:22,536 --> 00:11:24,969
- That's gonna be it from
us, have a wonderful week,

208
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:27,263
and start your weekend off awesome.

209
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:30,190
Thank you guys for watching,
and we will see you tomorrow.

210
00:11:30,190 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
