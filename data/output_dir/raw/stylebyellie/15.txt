1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,852
- Before dinner, somebody may have gotten

2
00:00:01,852 --> 00:00:03,052
a little in trouble.

3
00:00:03,052 --> 00:00:04,802
- Hallelujah, halle--

4
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,381
- We're in our oasis.

5
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:10,540
Do people with campers do something cool?

6
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,957
- Found a monkey in the tree!

7
00:00:15,526 --> 00:00:18,276
(cheerful music)

8
00:00:21,477 --> 00:00:24,271
Are you gonna film or are
you gonna help? (chuckles)

9
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:27,021
(cheerful music)

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,610
Jackson wants to know why
he loves rocks. (chuckles)

11
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,145
And I said, "I don't know, you just do."

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,820
Do you still like rocks?

13
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,543
- I love golden rocks.

14
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,860
- Golden rocks.

15
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,640
We're gonna go on an adventure today.

16
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,520
- I love golden blue rocks.

17
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,939
- Golden poo rocks?

18
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,781
- No, golden blue rocks.

19
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:20,010
- Ohh, I could've sworn you said poo.

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,740
You said golden blue. (chuckles)

21
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,100
We're just waiting on Calvin to wake up,

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,330
and then we are going!

23
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,660
- Good morning, Calvin.

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,734
You ready to go?

25
00:01:27,734 --> 00:01:28,590
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,660
- Yeah, 'kay, let's do a little roll call.

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,521
Big dog, check.

28
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:34,520
Doggie blanket, check.

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,390
Little dog, check.

30
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,850
I think you're all set to go.

31
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,683
- Mm-hmm.

32
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:39,516
- You got everything?

33
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,349
- Grab a blanket, I've got mine,

34
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:42,309
Jackson's got his, let's go!

35
00:01:42,309 --> 00:01:43,142
- Let's go!

36
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,300
Yeah, we got one more person.

37
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,410
We'll get all these people loaded,

38
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,013
and then we'll bring our favorite, Penny.

39
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:49,156
We can't forget Penny,
that's the other roll call.

40
00:01:49,156 --> 00:01:50,278
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,111
- Pen.

42
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:52,104
- Let's go!

43
00:01:52,104 --> 00:01:54,946
- [Ellie] We're saluting
every camper that we drive by.

44
00:01:54,946 --> 00:01:56,220
(laughs)

45
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,200
Did he say hi?

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,421
- Yeah, he did. (laughs)

47
00:01:58,421 --> 00:02:00,150
He gave me a little peace sign.

48
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,650
Well, I was just thinking, you know,

49
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,291
I gave that guy a little, a salute,

50
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:06,474
because he was, you know,
he had a trailer, too.

51
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,870
Motorcycles, when they see
each other pass on the road,

52
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,330
they like do a little, you
know, a little hand wave.

53
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,440
Subarus, when they see
each other on the road,

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
they do a little gesture to each other,

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,960
like hey, you drive a
Subaru, you're cool, too.

56
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,896
Do people with campers do something cool?

57
00:02:19,896 --> 00:02:22,246
Do people with Teslas do something cool?

58
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,760
Like, am I missing out on being in this

59
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,880
exclusive hand gesture group?

60
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,713
- [Ellie] You're gonna
have to look at your

61
00:02:27,713 --> 00:02:29,098
Facebook group that you're a part of now.

62
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:30,482
- I will, I will have to look at.

63
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,331
So we have an expandable trailer,

64
00:02:32,331 --> 00:02:34,360
so the beds pop out.

65
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,530
- Jared's told me this
probably, like, 100 times,

66
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,313
so I think he should probably tell you.

67
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,580
- It just makes me laugh.

68
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,600
But, you know, sometimes it can get cold,

69
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,240
or you don't have a lot of people

70
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,870
that you're traveling with, so you don't

71
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,140
have to pull the beds out, you can just

72
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,394
use the beds on the inside.

73
00:02:47,394 --> 00:02:49,568
And they call that turtling.

74
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:50,830
(laughs)

75
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,155
Get it, 'cause the turtle heads and tail,

76
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:54,587
they don't pop out.

77
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:55,420
They're turtling.

78
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,253
- [Ellie] It's cute.

79
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:57,110
- They're turtling!

80
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:02,750
Okay, oh, stretch those legs, Miss Penny.

81
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,950
(laughs) You've been
the best passenger ever.

82
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:08,243
Let's go!

83
00:03:08,243 --> 00:03:09,076
Do you want some water?

84
00:03:09,076 --> 00:03:10,930
I got some nice cold
water for you, let's go.

85
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,430
So this is a trip that we are taking

86
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,720
the whole fam damily on.

87
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,990
We've got Penny with us,
and we have some fun things

88
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,560
scheduled to take Penny and the kids on.

89
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,894
We wanted to get out into
the nature and wilderness.

90
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,791
Well, I mean, I guess as far as

91
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:28,030
the nature goes where we're going.

92
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,296
It's not the most scenic place,

93
00:03:30,296 --> 00:03:35,060
but it's a wonderful place
for kids and family and dogs.

94
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,832
So we're really excited
to take Penny with us

95
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,068
on this trip, because
I feel like she's been

96
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,550
missing out a little bit.

97
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,900
She's sniffing poo right now.

98
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,630
She's not really missing
out on what she wants.

99
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,187
This is what she wants to do right now.

100
00:03:45,187 --> 00:03:46,280
Smell other dog's poo.

101
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,300
It's kind of, kind of weird, I guess.

102
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,210
- Traveling with kids,
whether it's luxury or not,

103
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,855
can sometimes be a little stressful.

104
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,225
Calvin, at the very last
minute walking out the house,

105
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:58,865
I was like, we should grab his potty!

106
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:02,167
Because he's really good to go
to the bathroom at our house,

107
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:04,424
on our toilets, but when
we're out and about,

108
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:07,350
he's very hesitant, and especially toilets

109
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,930
that automatically flush.

110
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,740
Oh boy, no, hmm-mm.

111
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,420
And so I just went in
the bathroom, I went,

112
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,950
Jackson went, and then
it was Calvin's turn,

113
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,732
and he just (screams).

114
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,860
And I was like, okay,
let's go use your potty,

115
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,841
it's in the car, and he willingly,

116
00:04:20,841 --> 00:04:23,300
thank you very much, used his potty.

117
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,520
So, I'm really glad we brought it,

118
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,104
but like I said, sometimes it's,

119
00:04:27,104 --> 00:04:29,110
traveling with kids, that's what you do.

120
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,930
You bring their potties,
you bring what they need,

121
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,466
you bring the stuff to clean it out.

122
00:04:32,466 --> 00:04:34,292
But I'm proud of you, good job!

123
00:04:34,292 --> 00:04:35,810
- Thanks, Mom.

124
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,570
- And someday you won't
be scared of it, huh?

125
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:38,540
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,060
- It's just kind of loud right now?

127
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,910
Does it go (imitates toilet flushing)?

128
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:45,140
(Calvin mumbles)

129
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,548
Next time will you try it?

130
00:04:46,548 --> 00:04:47,450
- Um, no.

131
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,333
- Nope. (laughs)

132
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,928
Very honest.

133
00:04:50,928 --> 00:04:54,030
The fun thing about driving
in the middle of nowhere,

134
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,282
where no cars are around...

135
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:58,590
(horn honks)

136
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,460
You can horn to the music.

137
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,721
- Our horn almost is almost
exactly on pitch with that note.

138
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,650
(Ellie chuckles)

139
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,664
Not anymore, 'cause of
the key change, obviously,

140
00:05:07,664 --> 00:05:08,936
but you know what I mean?

141
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:10,240
(honking horn)

142
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,178
("How Far I'll Go" by Auli'i
Cravalho plays in background)

143
00:05:14,178 --> 00:05:15,111
(laughs)

144
00:05:15,111 --> 00:05:16,920
- [Ellie] Calvin's asleep, Penny's asleep.

145
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,007
Hi, Jackson!

146
00:05:18,007 --> 00:05:19,440
What are you eating?

147
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,209
Peanuts!

148
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,411
- The jet, Dad.

149
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,550
- [Jared] What do you see?

150
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,579
- The jet.

151
00:05:25,579 --> 00:05:27,170
- [Jared] Oh, a jet, that's cool!

152
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,188
Famous Jet Johnson was up there.

153
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:31,177
- [Ellie] Hey, you know
that hill up ahead?

154
00:05:31,177 --> 00:05:33,270
- [Jared] The really,
really steep one up there?

155
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,490
- [Ellie] I feel like we're gonna need to

156
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,871
fill up on gas when we're done. (laughs)

157
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,215
- Probably, right after that.

158
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:39,660
Look at that beautiful scenery.

159
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,231
That is behind us.

160
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:44,751
Welcome to the land of no snow.

161
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:48,250
Doesn't it feel to not be
where any snow is right now?

162
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,983
- Found a monkey in the tree!

163
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,520
A scared monkey.

164
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,060
- [Jared] Yeah, a scared monkey.

165
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,480
Yay, you caught the
monkey, let's keep him!

166
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,882
- I found a Spider-Man in the tree!

167
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:00,760
- [Jared] Look at you, Spidey, woo-hoo!

168
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,710
Nice work.

169
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:08,879
(relaxed music)

170
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,060
We're here!

171
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,060
We're in heaven, we're
in our oasis. (laughs)

172
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,628
Let me show you the coolest part,

173
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:35,221
but I've gotta hurry,
because we've got kids

174
00:06:35,221 --> 00:06:36,940
in the car that we need to get out

175
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,010
because they are anxious.

176
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:38,843
I am ready, too.

177
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:39,880
Check that out.

178
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,550
There's the pool,
there's a putting course.

179
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,450
It's gonna be fun.

180
00:06:45,793 --> 00:06:48,780
- [Ellie] Maybe tomorrow
we can get in it, okay?

181
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,847
I think it's back there somewhere.

182
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:53,100
(gasps) Cool, huh?

183
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,416
'Kay, let's go get Penny and our bikes.

184
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:58,166
(pleasant music)

185
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,060
- That's your bed, Cal.

186
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,200
Do you like your bed?

187
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,526
- Yeah, it's warm.

188
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:12,120
- [Jared] It's warm? (laughs)

189
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,331
One, two, three, up!

190
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,640
There you go.

191
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,758
What do you think?

192
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:16,605
- It's good.

193
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:17,679
- [Jared] It's good?

194
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,415
(chuckles)

195
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:22,165
(pleasant music)

196
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,650
- It's the end of a long,
long travel day. (laughs)

197
00:07:37,873 --> 00:07:40,980
Penny is getting some much
needed running time in,

198
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,550
and we are hitting the hay.

199
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,723
The kids are set up over
here, our bathroom is set up

200
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:49,510
right here, it's been a long time

201
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,750
since we've showed you guys.

202
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,915
Our fridge is nice and full, I precooked

203
00:07:53,915 --> 00:07:55,853
a bunch of food in there.

204
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:59,950
So we are all set to go for food.

205
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,820
Jared and I over there.

206
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,170
The first day is always a little crazy.

207
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,116
The kids are spent, Penny is
spent, Mom and Dad are spent.

208
00:08:07,116 --> 00:08:08,970
Jared's finishing up his walk.

209
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,870
I just got a little dinner ready.

210
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,260
Super easy, I just
pre-made, I just pre-cooked

211
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,760
some ground beef before I came,

212
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,410
and we're having nacho
salad, nacho tacos in a bag.

213
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:22,716
Super easy, super yummy, the kids are just

214
00:08:22,716 --> 00:08:24,550
(chuckling) loving their chips.

215
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,122
- We are newbies still.

216
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:29,331
There are like five
fires, not actual fires,

217
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,910
but like, you know, fires
that I'm putting out,

218
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,938
trying to get things figured out.

219
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:36,460
Penny is right here right now.

220
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,980
She may or may not have dinner tonight.

221
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,700
I will get her dinner
tonight, don't worry.

222
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,751
But anyway, as I was getting everything

223
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,498
solved and figured out, Mom told me that

224
00:08:44,498 --> 00:08:47,810
you kids said a good prayer.

225
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,249
What did you say in your prayer tonight?

226
00:08:49,249 --> 00:08:50,735
- [Jackson] I did a beautiful, um--

227
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:52,244
- You did a beautiful one?

228
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,827
- A beautiful song.

229
00:08:55,104 --> 00:08:56,434
My song was like this.

230
00:08:56,434 --> 00:09:00,147
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

231
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:01,309
- That's a good prayer.

232
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:02,210
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪

233
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,012
'Kay, I'm gonna ask Mom in a second.

234
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:06,925
- Goodnight.

235
00:09:06,925 --> 00:09:08,567
- Goodnight, friend.

236
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,800
- Aww! (chuckles)

237
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,539
We have such a fun adventure
for the next couple days.

238
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,779
So we need to go--

239
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,140
(Calvin vocalizing)

240
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,973
Yeah.

241
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:21,950
- Go hiking to find a golden rock for me.

242
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,824
- I think that sounds like a great idea.

243
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,200
So we're gonna have a lot of fun tomorrow.

244
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,960
that means we need to go to bed tonight

245
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,305
and get some sleep, okay?

246
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:30,138
- Yup.

247
00:09:30,138 --> 00:09:32,470
- Yeah, so will you boys
lay down on your beds?

248
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,280
- Why are you gonna lay with Mom?

249
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,520
- 'Cause that's where Daddy sleeps.

250
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,350
- Why is Penny down there?

251
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,000
- Well, 'cause that's where Penny sleeps.

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,120
'Kay, lay in your beds and we'll say

253
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,200
goodnight to our friends, okay?

254
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,101
Lay down.

255
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:45,980
- Night, friends.

256
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,988
- [Jared] Night, friends.

257
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:47,890
- [Jackson] Goodnight.

258
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,890
(children giggling)

259
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:01,014
- [Calvin] No you close eyes.

260
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,564
- [Jackson] No, you close your eyes.

261
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:05,341
(Calvin giggles)

262
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,174
Open your eyes.

263
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:08,424
(giggling)

264
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,863
- Before dinner, somebody may have gotten

265
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,312
a little in trouble.

266
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:18,220
Just sassiness,
four-year-old was going on.

267
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,741
And I talked to Jackson about
it, and he got in trouble,

268
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:24,824
and when he was saying his prayers,

269
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:28,012
he was so cute, and he was like,

270
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:31,481
"And I will be good to
my mother tomorrow."

271
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:32,369
(laughs)

272
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:34,930
I literally was like, "You are so cute!"

273
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,233
My mother, I never refer
to myself as mother.

274
00:10:38,233 --> 00:10:40,500
I just thought it was really cute.

275
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,787
I'm really glad to hear them laughing.

276
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:45,678
We are going to say
goodnight, and I can't wait

277
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:48,920
to take everyone on an adventure tomorrow.

278
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,950
Today it was getting
here, we were driving,

279
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,210
what, nine hours.

280
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,750
Plenty of stops for everyone.

281
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,290
Everyone was just like, ready to conk.

282
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,060
Except those two, good grief.

283
00:10:58,060 --> 00:00:00,000
'Kay, see you tomorrow guys, bye!
