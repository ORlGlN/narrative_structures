1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,215
- This is, by far, the
coldest room in the house.

2
00:00:02,215 --> 00:00:04,855
I asked you guys to ask some questions

3
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:08,371
because today Jared and
I are doing and Q and A.

4
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,511
- You've asked the questions

5
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:10,992
and we're gonna give the answers.

6
00:00:10,992 --> 00:00:12,944
- I'm still likely to get closer to Jared.

7
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:14,748
- I don't mind that!
- 'Cause I'm flippin cold!

8
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,731
- I don't mind that one bit!

9
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:18,376
This is why we work well together.

10
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:19,209
'Kay?

11
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:20,685
I like to cuddle and you
like me to keep you warm.

12
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:21,523
- Sounds awesome.

13
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,200
Alright, question number one.

14
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,605
- I think we should
start off with probably

15
00:00:24,605 --> 00:00:26,500
the most important question
that a lot of people have been

16
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,504
asking us and we've been meaning
to answer for a long time.

17
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:32,503
Would you rather fight
one horse-sized duck

18
00:00:32,503 --> 00:00:34,224
or 100 duck-sized horses?

19
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:35,627
- You are making that up!

20
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:36,963
- It's right there, Ellie!

21
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,411
(laughing)

22
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:39,581
Spencer asked us!

23
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,657
- Okay, he's not, I thought
you were making that up.

24
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:44,632
- No I would never make up
something like that so serious.

25
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:46,597
So I know my answer,
do you have an answer?

26
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:47,439
- What's your answer?

27
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,960
- I would rather fight
one horse-sized duck

28
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:54,671
because in my hopes, I would
be able to tame said duck.

29
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:58,323
I would put a saddle on this duck

30
00:00:58,323 --> 00:01:01,249
and hopefully this duck
would be able to fly around.

31
00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:03,076
Alright, now for the real questions.

32
00:01:03,076 --> 00:01:05,221
Out of all of life's lessons and love,

33
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,912
what is one wisdom or hope
you wish your children

34
00:01:07,912 --> 00:01:09,531
will carry with them always?

35
00:01:09,531 --> 00:01:10,865
That is a great question.

36
00:01:10,865 --> 00:01:14,940
I hope our kids learn that
it's okay to help others.

37
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,846
It's okay to be there for someone.

38
00:01:16,846 --> 00:01:20,151
And it's okay to think of
others before yourself.

39
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:21,517
But don't forget yourself.

40
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,694
- I really hope our kids are self-reliant.

41
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:26,965
I feel like if you can
take care of yourself

42
00:01:26,965 --> 00:01:28,535
and your spouse and your family,

43
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:31,470
it gives tons of opportunities
to help other people.

44
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,308
- Absolutely.

45
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:34,328
- So I would say self-reliant.

46
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,888
When are you guys doing a holiday

47
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,700
with Daily Bumps and Cullen and Katie?

48
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,167
- Oooh, #DBEJCKWinterVacay, or vacay,

49
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,690
did I just give it away?

50
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:43,688
- It is so true

51
00:01:43,688 --> 00:01:46,805
and it's been a little
bit harder to get together

52
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,122
all at the same time this last year.

53
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,155
There's just been,

54
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:53,378
all of us have done lots
of stuff with our family

55
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:56,560
and so it has been a littler
harder to get together

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,287
when we've wanted, but--

57
00:01:58,287 --> 00:02:01,996
- We are looking into
doing a winter vacay.

58
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,152
No promises, but that's the plan.

59
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,302
I really want to know if
Ellie does her hair and makeup

60
00:02:06,302 --> 00:02:09,382
more than she normally
would because of the vlogs?

61
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,711
She always looks so pretty.

62
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,897
Well that's very nice of you.

63
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:12,730
- Thank you.

64
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,074
No I do not do it more
because of the videos.

65
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:17,632
If you go back and even watch

66
00:02:17,632 --> 00:02:19,685
the very first of the videos,

67
00:02:19,685 --> 00:02:22,266
I mean I guess, doesn't make
sense 'cause we were filming

68
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,180
but even back at the beginning,

69
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,012
I always get ready the same amount.

70
00:02:27,012 --> 00:02:30,242
When I was in hair school
and then working at a salon,

71
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:32,997
it's kind of expected to get ready.

72
00:02:32,997 --> 00:02:34,859
Like you're helping
other people spruce up,

73
00:02:34,859 --> 00:02:37,711
so it's just a habit of
just always getting ready.

74
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:39,000
And I feel better.

75
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,191
It doesn't take that
much time in the morning.

76
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,392
I wake up and that's one of
the first things I do is--

77
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:45,584
- Put on your makeup?

78
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:46,417
♫ Wake up

79
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:47,250
- Well just get ready.

80
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,083
- Oh.

81
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,282
(laughs)

82
00:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,244
- Like I wake up and we eat breakfast

83
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:54,190
and it's really not that much.

84
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,146
We have our routine.

85
00:02:55,146 --> 00:02:56,998
I take the kids, get 'em dressed

86
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:58,611
and then sometimes they play with toys,

87
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,039
sometimes they sit in
the bathroom with me,

88
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,374
sometimes they watch a show,

89
00:03:01,374 --> 00:03:04,226
and I take 20 minutes, wash
my face, put on some makeup.

90
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,732
♫ Grab a brush and put a little makeup

91
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:08,352
- Any advice for someone who
want to start daily vlogging?

92
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:12,043
Yes, I think I could
think of a few things.

93
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:15,307
When we started, we
didn't jump in completely

94
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,095
into every single day.

95
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,382
And I think that's a hard thing to do.

96
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:23,495
I enjoyed our transition from once a week

97
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,812
to a couple times a week to--

98
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:26,645
- Three times a week.

99
00:03:26,645 --> 00:03:27,719
- Yeah, to daily.

100
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:31,234
I felt like that was good
for us to ease into it

101
00:03:31,234 --> 00:03:34,521
and kinda tiptoe through it.

102
00:03:34,521 --> 00:03:36,463
I always try and say,

103
00:03:36,463 --> 00:03:38,900
do it for yourself first.

104
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,032
We have these videos
for our memories first

105
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:45,049
and then for everything else after.

106
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:47,549
- And we tell ourselves that even now,

107
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:49,962
hence why we're doing a Q and A today,

108
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:52,098
we don't do this very often,

109
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,740
but there's just lots going on right now

110
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,885
and instead of pulling it
out just to pull it out,

111
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:02,232
is not what I want to do.

112
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:05,212
And I've been enjoying that lately.

113
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,406
We have to remind ourselves that.

114
00:04:07,406 --> 00:04:09,909
We don't have to film morning to night.

115
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,403
We can film in the evening.

116
00:04:11,403 --> 00:04:12,686
We can film just the morning.

117
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,519
We can film--

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,245
- It's important to have
fun with what you're doing.

119
00:04:16,245 --> 00:04:17,911
- Totally, and we do.

120
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:20,257
- When it's Christmas
will you get another pet?

121
00:04:20,257 --> 00:04:23,384
I will pet Ellie's head and I will Penny,

122
00:04:23,384 --> 00:04:26,008
but as another pet, probably not.

123
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:27,109
I would say no.

124
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:31,597
What is your favorite
off-camera family activity?

125
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:32,556
I don't know.

126
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:35,878
I play guitar and video games.

127
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:38,026
That's my personal thing.

128
00:04:38,026 --> 00:04:40,105
What about you?

129
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:42,002
- What we do off camera,

130
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,626
we do lots of things off
camera, but something

131
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:47,491
that we specifically do
as an activity off camera?

132
00:04:47,491 --> 00:04:48,881
- Not that.

133
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:50,661
But what do we do?

134
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:52,444
- Well, specifically,

135
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:54,930
we sing and dance a lot.

136
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,325
And we don't really film that as much.

137
00:04:57,325 --> 00:05:00,687
And we have the music going quite a bit

138
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:02,785
and we all love to dance together.

139
00:05:02,785 --> 00:05:03,983
- Especially Calvin.

140
00:05:03,983 --> 00:05:05,863
- Yeah, you see Calvin
and Jackson dancing,

141
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:08,344
but we like to dance.

142
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:09,926
- How do you start a YouTube channel?

143
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:10,822
I really want to.

144
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,623
What are some tips on
where and how to edit?

145
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:15,797
So every time someone asks me

146
00:05:15,797 --> 00:05:17,500
on starting a YouTube channel,

147
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,137
I point them the other direction

148
00:05:20,137 --> 00:05:23,792
to Derral Eves, Tim
Schmoyer, Roberto Blake,

149
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:28,047
video influencers, all of those
channels that I listed there

150
00:05:28,047 --> 00:05:31,783
are really, really great resources

151
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:34,988
to start a YouTube channel
and start it correctly.

152
00:05:34,988 --> 00:05:37,326
- And we've told a lot of friends, too,

153
00:05:37,326 --> 00:05:40,300
ask what you want on
YouTube in the search bar.

154
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,852
How to edit, how to do this,

155
00:05:41,852 --> 00:05:44,442
and you will find videos
that really teach you how

156
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:47,076
and that's something that
I've had to do a lot too

157
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:49,585
is looking up stuff on YouTube.

158
00:05:49,585 --> 00:05:52,267
- Which brings me to a question for you.

159
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:55,161
Some people have asked me how I edit,

160
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:58,170
what I use to edit, and
instead of just answering

161
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,013
those questions, I was
wondering if you guys

162
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:02,112
would be interested in seeing that done,

163
00:06:02,112 --> 00:06:03,510
the process that we take.

164
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,909
Let me know in the comments down below

165
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,144
if you would like to see that

166
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,838
and give it a thumbs up
if you'd like to see that.

167
00:06:07,838 --> 00:06:08,671
- I think you should.

168
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:09,504
I think that'd be awesome.

169
00:06:09,504 --> 00:06:11,086
- Well we've got one person who wants to.

170
00:06:11,086 --> 00:06:12,926
- Would you guys ever
consider leaving YouTube

171
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:15,303
and living more of a private life?

172
00:06:15,303 --> 00:06:17,490
That is very interesting.

173
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,966
And to be honest, I love what we do.

174
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,453
I feel like it has given
Jared and I a big purpose.

175
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:26,323
I feel like we have had really amazing

176
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,085
opportunities to help people.

177
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:32,918
We've had amazing opportunities
to have fun with our family.

178
00:06:32,918 --> 00:06:34,642
It's an amazing thing all around.

179
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:37,885
I don't think Jared and
I will ever stop sharing

180
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:40,150
whatever platform new comes out.

181
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,391
If whatever's after YouTube,
if something else is there,

182
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:44,080
we'll probably be on that.

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,044
I think that we enjoy that.

184
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:49,625
As far as living more of a
private life, absolutely.

185
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,548
I don't know what it's gonna be like

186
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:53,174
even in another two years,

187
00:06:53,174 --> 00:06:55,220
like when Jackson goes to school.

188
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,137
I mean, we already are really careful

189
00:06:57,137 --> 00:07:00,441
about not showing his preschool
and not showing his friends

190
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,896
and not showing the neighbor friends

191
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,733
when they come over and play.

192
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:07,047
And sometimes that's hard
because the neighbor kids,

193
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,766
Jackson had a friend over
the other day for four hours

194
00:07:09,766 --> 00:07:12,046
and for four hours we didn't film

195
00:07:12,046 --> 00:07:13,682
and so it's like,

196
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:15,896
in a way that's kinda
hard 'cause I wanted to,

197
00:07:15,896 --> 00:07:19,506
but there are many things
that we keep private

198
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,917
and I've enjoyed what we have shared.

199
00:07:21,917 --> 00:07:22,750
- Yeah.

200
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,862
So in short, we do live a pretty
private life on some parts.

201
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:29,278
And we do choose what we want to share.

202
00:07:29,278 --> 00:07:33,006
- But as far as the future, I mean,

203
00:07:33,006 --> 00:07:35,315
I think we'll always be sharing something.

204
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,397
What are your goals for the upcoming year?

205
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:38,606
Do you have any?

206
00:07:38,606 --> 00:07:40,281
- I have some, no, yeah, I do,

207
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:42,346
I mean I have some business goals.

208
00:07:42,346 --> 00:07:43,870
We have some projects that I want

209
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,924
to make sure get done in 2018,

210
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:50,099
which it seems like such a long time,

211
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,395
but with what we're doing,

212
00:07:51,395 --> 00:07:54,173
it does take that time to get there.

213
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,957
- We have a lot of fun ambitions.

214
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:56,790
- Yeah.

215
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,992
Ellie and I were just talking about

216
00:07:57,992 --> 00:08:00,772
how we want to take dance lessons.

217
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,961
I picture, in my head, all of the time,

218
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:05,663
a couple different things.

219
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:06,842
It's so dumb.

220
00:08:06,842 --> 00:08:07,872
I don't know why.

221
00:08:07,872 --> 00:08:08,705
- Don't say that!

222
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,378
- Well, just listen to what I say,

223
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:12,402
I picture myself, it's raining outside,

224
00:08:12,402 --> 00:08:14,110
the lighting is perfect,

225
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,295
and then we're just dancing in the rain.

226
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,277
And we're just having a really great time.

227
00:08:18,277 --> 00:08:19,477
And then another time--

228
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:21,188
- It's gonna snow in a few weeks.

229
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:22,748
You could dance with me in the snow.

230
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:24,875
- In the snow, that would be really cute.

231
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,851
The beginning of one of our videos,

232
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:30,239
it just has this really
fun three-quarter time,

233
00:08:30,239 --> 00:08:31,721
is that a waltz?

234
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:34,789
And we're just dancing and
the intro of the music.

235
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,337
Yeah, I don't know, I just--

236
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:37,511
- I think that sounds amazing.

237
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,891
I want to do dance lessons with Jared.

238
00:08:39,892 --> 00:08:41,525
- Beside date nights, what's your

239
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:43,585
favorite thing to do together?

240
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:46,746
Ellie and I like to do
a few things together.

241
00:08:46,746 --> 00:08:48,972
One of which is we watch shows.

242
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:50,001
(Ellie laughs)

243
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:53,141
The other is we like
to take baths together.

244
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:53,974
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:56,598
- We have a big bathtub and
ever since we were married,

246
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,015
we've taken baths together and--

247
00:08:58,015 --> 00:08:59,472
- Even in our small bathtub!

248
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,451
- Yeah the tubs beforehand were so tiny,

249
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:04,873
but now this one that
we have is pretty big,

250
00:09:04,873 --> 00:09:06,222
so I like, yeah!

251
00:09:06,222 --> 00:09:07,980
Bath time!
- It's fun to take baths.

252
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,439
And we just sit and we talk about our day.

253
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:13,703
It's just nice to unwind in a warm bath.

254
00:09:13,703 --> 00:09:15,039
And we also get in the hot tub,

255
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,924
but there's something fun about the tub

256
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:18,873
where we're just squished in there.

257
00:09:18,873 --> 00:09:20,266
(laughing)

258
00:09:20,266 --> 00:09:23,878
What do you think Matt and Em are having?

259
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:26,208
- For those who don't
know, my brother Matt

260
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,101
and his wife Emily are expecting.

261
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,321
- And I think that they
are gonna have a girl.

262
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,283
- I would love for them to have a girl.

263
00:09:33,283 --> 00:09:34,883
But I think they're gonna have a boy.

264
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:36,062
(laughs)

265
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:39,348
- I don't know very many,

266
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:40,788
I know a lot of families
that have a lot of kids.

267
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,214
I don't know of very many families

268
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:45,927
that just have four straight
girls or four straight boys.

269
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:48,191
So that's what I think will happen.

270
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:50,218
- My cousin has four straight boys

271
00:09:50,218 --> 00:09:52,575
and then their last one was a girl.

272
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:53,902
So that's definitely--

273
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:54,735
- We'll see.

274
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:57,524
But I don't know, I can
see them having a girl.

275
00:09:57,524 --> 00:10:00,357
- What show or shows are you
addicted to at the moment?

276
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:01,381
Ellie, give it to 'em.

277
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:02,718
- Parenthood.

278
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:04,970
Do you think vlogging
makes you better parents,

279
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,478
worse, or the same?

280
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:10,645
And I definitely feel like I am the parent

281
00:10:11,622 --> 00:10:15,789
and I teach the kids and I don't
put vlogging into that mix.

282
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:17,868
- Yeah.

283
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,455
With or without YouTube, our
parenting would be the same.

284
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:23,024
- And saying with or without YouTube,

285
00:10:23,024 --> 00:10:26,803
am I a giving person or am I a nice wife

286
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:29,168
or do I lose my patience?

287
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,708
I lose my patience just as much

288
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:32,029
as if I vlogged or didn't vlog

289
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,174
and same with parenting

290
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,101
and I think it is so, so important

291
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:38,481
that there is separation.

292
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:39,341
- Absolutely.

293
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:43,274
- And I do, I do feel like there's a very,

294
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:44,978
and big importance that
there is separation.

295
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:47,398
- Because it could get to the point

296
00:10:47,398 --> 00:10:49,418
where there is an interference.

297
00:10:49,418 --> 00:10:52,701
Why do you call your in-laws Mom and Dad?

298
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:53,534
I have a couple different--

299
00:10:53,534 --> 00:10:54,851
- 'Cause they're my mom and dad!

300
00:10:54,851 --> 00:10:55,684
- Yeah.

301
00:10:55,684 --> 00:10:56,517
We're family.

302
00:10:56,517 --> 00:10:58,469
We married into the family
and that's one thing.

303
00:10:58,469 --> 00:11:02,311
But I also feel like
it's a sign of respect.

304
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:07,060
To me, there's nothing
more valuable and important

305
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,913
than calling someone Mom or Dad.

306
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:12,362
Because that, it's a title to me.

307
00:11:12,362 --> 00:11:15,563
And there's so much weight
that goes along with it.

308
00:11:15,563 --> 00:11:17,996
To call them by anything else, I think,

309
00:11:17,996 --> 00:11:20,042
would be taking away from that title.

310
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:21,151
You know what I mean?

311
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:21,984
- Yeah.

312
00:11:21,984 --> 00:11:23,610
And not everyone may feel comfortable

313
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,537
and that's totally okay.

314
00:11:25,537 --> 00:11:26,521
Totally okay.

315
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:28,419
- Like if Ellie's mom
and dad didn't want me

316
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,698
to call them Mom and Dad,
I would respect that.

317
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:31,531
- Oh yeah.

318
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,426
And if you,

319
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:34,094
it doesn't mean you don't love them

320
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:35,339
just as much if you don't.

321
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,066
Jared and I have always just
felt very the same about it.

322
00:11:38,066 --> 00:11:39,548
- What's the best part about sharing

323
00:11:39,548 --> 00:11:41,089
your life with the world?

324
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,631
Seeing that we can put
a smile on your face

325
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:45,028
puts a smile on our face

326
00:11:45,028 --> 00:11:48,265
and it's this community that
we have that is just amazing.

327
00:11:48,265 --> 00:11:50,306
- It's nothing like I
ever thought it would be.

328
00:11:50,306 --> 00:11:52,604
It was really cool,

329
00:11:52,604 --> 00:11:55,539
the video we were able
to help make for Andy,

330
00:11:55,539 --> 00:11:59,654
and how for years they've
been trying to find a match

331
00:11:59,654 --> 00:12:01,398
and they finally found someone in England

332
00:12:01,398 --> 00:12:03,265
that they've been talking to.

333
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:04,098
That is,

334
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,210
that I have to sit back and be like,

335
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,884
this is why we do it.

336
00:12:08,884 --> 00:12:10,731
Ariel and Riley just had their baby--

337
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,132
- Wait.

338
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,341
They just had their baby!

339
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:17,826
- She just had a baby and it's like,

340
00:12:17,826 --> 00:12:19,507
that is why we do what we do.

341
00:12:19,507 --> 00:12:23,218
And we do so much fun stuff,

342
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:24,366
but at the end of the day,

343
00:12:24,366 --> 00:12:27,411
when I look back and when
I am teaching our kids

344
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,933
why we've done what we've done,

345
00:12:28,933 --> 00:12:29,766
that's why.

346
00:12:29,766 --> 00:12:32,251
It's been a really cool experience
and it's hard to explain

347
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,888
to people, friends, family sometimes,

348
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:38,481
but someday they'll get it.

349
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:41,120
And I understand it and I love what we do

350
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,357
and I wouldn't,

351
00:12:42,357 --> 00:12:45,328
I love what we do.

352
00:12:45,328 --> 00:12:47,234
- That was beautiful.

353
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:51,404
(laughing)

354
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:54,605
Slow clap.

355
00:12:54,605 --> 00:12:55,447
I'm serious, though.

356
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:56,895
It was really sweet.

357
00:12:56,895 --> 00:12:58,488
Yeah, it was sweet!

358
00:12:58,488 --> 00:12:59,709
- Well I meant it.

359
00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:01,418
- What do your boys want for Christmas?

360
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:02,470
I need some inspiration.

361
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:03,960
(laughing) Your kid
stories are always awesome.

362
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,043
Well, what does Jackson want?

363
00:13:05,043 --> 00:13:06,019
He wants one thing.

364
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:06,979
- What does he want?

365
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:07,874
(both) A marble run.

366
00:13:07,874 --> 00:13:09,202
Anything that does with music,

367
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,043
both boys really love music right now.

368
00:13:11,043 --> 00:13:14,856
So any sort of instrument
would be really fun for them.

369
00:13:14,856 --> 00:13:16,497
- So, Santa, if you're listening,

370
00:13:16,497 --> 00:13:17,928
(clicks tongue) write that down.

371
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:18,761
(laughs)

372
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,358
If you could move anywhere in the world

373
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:23,601
except the United States,
where would it be and why?

374
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:24,534
Can you think of a place?

375
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:25,557
- I haven't really been out,

376
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:27,064
so I don't have much to go off of,

377
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,410
but I would say New Zealand.

378
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,243
- Yeah.

379
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:30,463
Ellie's aunt used to live there,

380
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:31,677
so we've heard really great things.

381
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,720
Plus that's where Hobbiton is.

382
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,350
Is that what that place, where
the hobbits live is called?

383
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,575
I can't remember.

384
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,961
I would love to live in Finland again.

385
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,677
I really, really would.

386
00:13:42,677 --> 00:13:44,521
We plan on going back there.

387
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:45,860
It's still on our list.

388
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,906
- This is a really good one
and it might be our last.

389
00:13:48,906 --> 00:13:52,963
How do both of you settle
arguments, disagreements you have,

390
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,579
about kids, YouTube, et cetera?

391
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,639
- We get out the boxing
gloves and we punch it out.

392
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,972
Just punch it out real good.

393
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:06,082
- I feel like we're both
pretty good to talk things out.

394
00:14:06,957 --> 00:14:08,564
That's not always the case though.

395
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:11,558
Sometimes one of us is a lot
more angry than the other.

396
00:14:11,558 --> 00:14:13,478
And it's, and that's normal.

397
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,637
- But that's the thing that
we've always strived for

398
00:14:15,637 --> 00:14:18,741
was a good communication,
and we're not perfect.

399
00:14:18,741 --> 00:14:22,040
And we're gonna go more into
this in a relationship Q and A

400
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,112
that I just, we talked about today.

401
00:14:24,112 --> 00:14:24,977
We're not perfect.

402
00:14:24,977 --> 00:14:26,332
But we do try and communicate

403
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:28,771
and that is such an important thing.

404
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:30,590
Is the communication.

405
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,293
I can't remember if I said it in a video

406
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,381
that's going up later this week

407
00:14:34,381 --> 00:14:36,460
or if it was already back,

408
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,458
no it's for the House Q and A.

409
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,820
It's important to have a lot
of these decisions made--

410
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,487
- Before the argument even happens.

411
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:43,320
- Exactly.

412
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,734
Before you get to there.

413
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:46,921
And that will solve a ton of problems.

414
00:14:46,921 --> 00:14:48,730
- Another thing that I think is helpful

415
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,414
is I've had a lot of
friends go to counseling

416
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,199
and I feel like sometimes
counseling gets a bad rap,

417
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:55,790
where it's like you've gone to counseling

418
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,834
'cause there's issues.

419
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:57,667
- Oh, it's bad.

420
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:59,982
- I've talked to a few
friends that they're like,

421
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,815
it's just good just to
have another open mind.

422
00:15:06,194 --> 00:15:07,599
To listen to what's going on

423
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:09,023
and to help you work things out.

424
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:11,868
Not necessarily even if you're like,

425
00:15:11,868 --> 00:15:14,085
even if you're not arguing and fighting,

426
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,650
it's still good to go to a counselor.

427
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,959
And I think that that
may even be good advice

428
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,474
before someone's married,

429
00:15:20,474 --> 00:15:23,360
to go in and to talk about money,

430
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,896
finances, intimacy, and religion,

431
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:31,601
and just that way, there's
already a counselor there

432
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:33,256
and you're just working
things out and talking.

433
00:15:33,256 --> 00:15:34,867
I think that that would be good advice.

434
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:37,830
We didn't do it, but I
am not opposed to that.

435
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,081
- Oh, I'd never be opposed.

436
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,608
When you were saying that,
I was like, you know what?

437
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:42,641
It might be fun to just do that.

438
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,958
- I think it would be smart.
- And just to talk.

439
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:47,272
- 'Cause everyone has arguments.

440
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:50,742
We have disagreements and I
feel like we get over them good,

441
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:52,870
but I still feel like that's something

442
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,460
that's not talked about, at
least that I don't hear about.

443
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,839
And I feel like my friends and
people I know that have gone

444
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:01,726
to counselors have been
very positive about it

445
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,937
and said that it's a really good thing.

446
00:16:03,937 --> 00:16:05,451
- Absolutely.

447
00:16:05,451 --> 00:16:09,133
And like you said, there's
usually a bad stigma

448
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,960
associated with going to a counselor.

449
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,503
That's not true at all.

450
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:15,171
People go there all the time.

451
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:16,391
Just to improve.

452
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:19,461
- I think stuff like that is
becoming a little bit more,

453
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:20,785
it's not just a negative thing.

454
00:16:20,785 --> 00:16:22,805
Kinda like depression, it's like,

455
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,271
a lot of people have depression.

456
00:16:24,271 --> 00:16:25,660
It's okay to go get help.

457
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,396
And I think when, sometimes
people first hear that,

458
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:30,626
it's like, Oh you have depression.

459
00:16:30,626 --> 00:16:32,260
It's like, well, no.

460
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:35,177
- It's always okay to ask for help.

461
00:16:36,154 --> 00:16:38,286
And I feel like we should
say this right now.

462
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:41,164
If you feel like you are
struggling with anything right now,

463
00:16:41,164 --> 00:16:42,208
don't wait.

464
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,193
Go ask for help.

465
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:44,851
There's nothing to be ashamed about.

466
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:46,602
There's nothing to be ashamed about!

467
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:47,940
I'll tell you a story.

468
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,832
I went to a counselor
when I was a little kid

469
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:54,007
when I was thinking negative
things about myself.

470
00:16:54,007 --> 00:16:55,832
And we did a whole video about that.

471
00:16:55,832 --> 00:16:57,674
When I was 12 to 14, it was one of our

472
00:16:57,674 --> 00:17:00,230
very first year of vlogging.

473
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,787
Not ashamed about it at all.

474
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,626
Loved the outcome of it.

475
00:17:03,626 --> 00:17:05,300
And it's only gonna help.

476
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,350
I feel like that's a good point to end on.

477
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:08,330
- Yeah, me too.

478
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,820
- So, I feel like--

479
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,165
- Thank you guys for your questions.

480
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,162
I hope that we answered them okay.

481
00:17:13,163 --> 00:17:14,744
And it was really fun sitting down

482
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:15,864
and doing a Q and A.

483
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:16,698
- Yeah.

484
00:17:16,698 --> 00:17:19,714
So we will see you guys very soon.

485
00:17:19,714 --> 00:17:22,687
We're off to another country right now.

486
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:24,210
- And we'll be back soon.

487
00:17:24,210 --> 00:00:00,000
- Thanks for watching. Bye.
