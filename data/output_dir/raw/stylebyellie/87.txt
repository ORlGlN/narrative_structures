1
00:00:00,255 --> 00:00:01,924
- [Jackson] I pushed the right button.

2
00:00:01,924 --> 00:00:03,760
- [Jared] Merry Christmas Eve.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,593
What are you doing today?

4
00:00:04,593 --> 00:00:06,585
- [Jackson] Merry Christmas Eve.

5
00:00:06,585 --> 00:00:07,451
- Hi.

6
00:00:07,451 --> 00:00:08,835
- [Jackson] Hi.

7
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:11,227
- What are we making?

8
00:00:11,227 --> 00:00:14,184
- [Jackson] Waffle, Mickey Mouse pancakes.

9
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:15,319
- Woo hoo.

10
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:18,732
Did you thought that
Santa came last night?

11
00:00:18,732 --> 00:00:21,195
There's two presents under the tree.

12
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,596
And those are from Mommy and Daddy.

13
00:00:23,596 --> 00:00:24,987
That we're gonna open tonight okay?

14
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:26,556
- [Jackson] But I want to open mine.

15
00:00:26,556 --> 00:00:27,713
- You can open yours tonight.

16
00:00:27,713 --> 00:00:29,742
It was so cute, he thought it was,

17
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:30,740
you thought Santa had come.

18
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,436
He's coming tonight.

19
00:00:32,436 --> 00:00:34,472
- [Jackson] But I want
to open my presents.

20
00:00:34,472 --> 00:00:35,471
- Tonight.

21
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:36,304
- Right now?

22
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:37,668
- [Ellie] After church.

23
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:39,492
We'll go to church at lunch,

24
00:00:39,492 --> 00:00:40,753
that's kind of a hard look.

25
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:41,586
- [Jared] I know.

26
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:42,732
- We won't even wait until dark.

27
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,924
We'll open it right after church.

28
00:00:44,924 --> 00:00:46,693
- Is that gonna be fun?

29
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,455
Yeah and guess what?

30
00:00:48,455 --> 00:00:51,428
Church is only one hour
today, instead of three.

31
00:00:51,428 --> 00:00:52,261
(Jared laughs)

32
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:54,125
Merry Christmas Eve buddy.

33
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,537
- Merry Christmas.

34
00:00:55,537 --> 00:00:57,419
- [Jared] Merry Christmas buddy.

35
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:58,486
- [Jackson] I want to still help.

36
00:00:58,486 --> 00:00:59,596
- [Jared] You can help.

37
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:00,851
That's such a nice boy.

38
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:04,851
("Hark the Herald Angels Sing")

39
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:33,992
Ho Ho, Merry Christmas.

40
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:46,988
(laughing)

41
00:01:49,488 --> 00:01:51,059
(Calvin vocalizing)

42
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:52,953
- Did she lick your toe?

43
00:01:52,953 --> 00:01:53,786
- Yeah.

44
00:01:55,626 --> 00:01:57,876
(laughing)

45
00:01:59,698 --> 00:02:01,563
- I need a pillow for my legs.

46
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:04,314
So Mom and Dad, okay scoot over mister,

47
00:02:04,314 --> 00:02:05,178
at the Christmas party the other day,

48
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:07,658
the kids got Lego sets.

49
00:02:07,658 --> 00:02:09,294
There's Jackson's.

50
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:10,221
There's Calvin's.

51
00:02:10,222 --> 00:02:12,582
We're working on Calvin's first.

52
00:02:12,582 --> 00:02:14,462
He is very entertained with the dog,

53
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:17,161
the dog bone, where's the fire?

54
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,649
Right there yeah and
he's cooking on the fire.

55
00:02:19,649 --> 00:02:22,899
And Jackson's helping me build the SUV.

56
00:02:24,654 --> 00:02:26,296
Okay, did you get the pieces on?

57
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:27,129
- [Jackson] Uh-huh.

58
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:28,612
- Perfect, oop ooh close.

59
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:30,567
Does it look just like the picture?

60
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,400
- [Jackson] Yep.

61
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,197
- There's the picture.

62
00:02:33,197 --> 00:02:35,476
We've got it, okay, let's move on.

63
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:36,808
Find that long piece.

64
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:38,316
Over on this side.
- Okay.

65
00:02:38,316 --> 00:02:40,886
- [Ellie] It's over
here somewhere, perfect.

66
00:02:40,886 --> 00:02:43,726
Okay, yep all the way across.

67
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:46,559
(Jackson singing)

68
00:02:48,796 --> 00:02:51,302
What do you think of it?

69
00:02:51,302 --> 00:02:52,397
- I found the big one.
- Is that the dog bone?

70
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:53,834
- [Ellie] He is so entertained

71
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:56,405
with this little fire and the two people.

72
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:57,798
- [Jackson] Does this one go here?

73
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:59,287
- [Ellie] Oh let's look at the picture.

74
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,480
Let's flip the page.

75
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,269
Look.
- Mommy here.

76
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:04,882
- [Ellie] Want me to
put the dog bone in it?

77
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:05,715
- Yeah.

78
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,868
- [Ellie] Perfect.

79
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:10,741
What word did you learn
today while building?

80
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:12,382
- Hot dog style.

81
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:16,011
- [Ellie] Yep, I always say
no, do it the hot dog style.

82
00:03:16,011 --> 00:03:17,885
That's the word that we have learned.

83
00:03:17,885 --> 00:03:19,381
We are getting far on this.

84
00:03:19,381 --> 00:03:22,242
This looks great, okay next page.

85
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,781
He set them all up sitting.

86
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:26,241
Oh my gosh.

87
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,074
(Ellie laughs)

88
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:27,907
- That's cute.

89
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:29,001
They're having a little cookout.

90
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,080
- [Ellie] Happy Christmas Eve.

91
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,114
- [Jared] Happy Christmas Harry.

92
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,263
Happy Christmas Ron.

93
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:34,392
- Happy Christmas Harry.

94
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:35,238
- Happy Christmas Ron.

95
00:03:35,238 --> 00:03:36,071
- [Ellie] Are you having fun?

96
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:38,002
He always does that with his hands.

97
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:39,643
Penny's somewhere.

98
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:40,817
Ooh there's her bum.

99
00:03:40,817 --> 00:03:41,650
Hi girl.

100
00:03:42,511 --> 00:03:43,344
Hi girl.

101
00:03:43,344 --> 00:03:45,927
(Ellie laughs)

102
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,157
- Hi Penny.
- No no.

103
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:51,407
- [Ellie] He goes no no no.

104
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,074
- Hey Penny.

105
00:03:55,074 --> 00:03:56,345
(laughing)

106
00:03:56,345 --> 00:03:57,626
Popping out to say hello.

107
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,876
- [Ellie] Calvin's is done.

108
00:04:01,002 --> 00:04:05,131
Wow, he's putting all
those people in his camper.

109
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:07,048
Good job, look at that.

110
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:09,497
Do you love it?

111
00:04:09,497 --> 00:04:11,296
That's like our camper.

112
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:12,606
- [Jared] How cool is that?

113
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,961
- So cute and it opens up.

114
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,211
And that is it.

115
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:20,133
Look, those turned out awesome.

116
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:23,358
You have four wheelers.

117
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,175
And then these go down

118
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:27,566
to roll 'em into the back of the truck.

119
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:29,169
- [Jared] This is like ours.

120
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,774
Like we have a trailer.

121
00:04:30,774 --> 00:04:31,607
And we have a four-wheeler.

122
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:34,473
- [Ellie] Grandpa has a truck.

123
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:36,006
Thank you.

124
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:38,303
That was so unbelievably fun.

125
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,670
- They loved that.

126
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,878
That's so cool.

127
00:04:40,878 --> 00:04:45,045
(Jared sings "The Nutcracker March")

128
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:48,931
- Let's go, we're late!

129
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:50,997
- Look how good my
family looks for church.

130
00:04:50,997 --> 00:04:52,278
Yes, she's absolutely right.

131
00:04:52,278 --> 00:04:53,128
We are running late for church.

132
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,607
We have five minutes to get there,

133
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:56,440
and it doesn't take that long,

134
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,552
but we gotta get the kids in the car.

135
00:04:57,552 --> 00:04:58,385
Okay we're going to church

136
00:04:58,385 --> 00:04:59,482
and we'll see you in a second.

137
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:01,030
Bye.

138
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,863
- You've got to lead the music.

139
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:02,696
- Oh that's right.

140
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,691
I have to lead the music

141
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:04,907
in front of the entire church today.

142
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,507
It's gonna be crazy, and I'm kinda scared.

143
00:05:06,507 --> 00:05:10,703
Looks like we're having a white Christmas,

144
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:13,953
going to church with a white Christmas.

145
00:05:15,408 --> 00:05:16,647
Give me a kiss.

146
00:05:16,647 --> 00:05:18,132
Oh that's my good boy.

147
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,579
Merry Christmas my boy.

148
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,412
(upbeat music)

149
00:05:20,412 --> 00:05:21,744
And just like that,

150
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,785
we are back from church.

151
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,206
We're having a great time.

152
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:26,404
We've got some dessert out,

153
00:05:26,404 --> 00:05:28,858
we've got some snacks, chips and salsa.

154
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:31,139
Jackson are you playing with your Lego's?

155
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,722
- These came apart.

156
00:05:33,563 --> 00:05:34,396
- [Jared] You know what?

157
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:35,229
We're gonna have to put it back together.

158
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:36,877
What do you say about that?

159
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:37,710
- Yeah.

160
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,677
- Yeah, another favorite
Christmas or holiday snack

161
00:05:40,677 --> 00:05:44,245
that we have, are little smokies.

162
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:45,932
Oh man, those are heating up.

163
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:47,140
We especially like those

164
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,470
when we watch football
games, like the Superbowl,

165
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,373
those are like the go-to snacks.

166
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,620
Ah, this just feels so good Ellie.

167
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,564
- The kids were great at church.

168
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:56,397
Church was so fun,

169
00:05:56,397 --> 00:06:00,126
because they had so much
music today, more than normal.

170
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,515
- Yeah, it was really fun.
- It was so fun.

171
00:06:01,515 --> 00:06:03,932
- So I lead the primary kids.

172
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:07,257
They all got up in front
of the whole entire church

173
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:09,772
and did sign language
and sang Silent Night.

174
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:11,291
And I stood up and did
all the sign language

175
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:12,477
for Silent Night.

176
00:06:12,477 --> 00:06:14,159
Which was so fun albeit,

177
00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:15,841
I'll admit it, my heart was racing.

178
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:18,120
I was nervous, because all of the kids

179
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,329
were watching me for the signs.

180
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:20,826
- And all the adults were like--

181
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:22,681
- Yeah, well because it would be different

182
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,854
if I was standing up on stage,

183
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:26,723
like people were expecting
me to do that stuff,

184
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:30,165
but I'm standing on the ground level

185
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,341
in front of the kids,

186
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,365
and so I kind of stick
out like a sore thumb.

187
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:34,486
So it is Christmas Eve

188
00:06:34,486 --> 00:06:36,523
and we are just getting things started.

189
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,008
- Jackson and Calvin, come here.

190
00:06:39,008 --> 00:06:39,841
- [Jackson] Okay.

191
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,629
- We've had these for
probably a year and a half.

192
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:44,964
We brought them from our apartment

193
00:06:44,964 --> 00:06:46,133
into the house.

194
00:06:46,133 --> 00:06:48,822
Haven't opened 'em yet.

195
00:06:48,822 --> 00:06:50,350
I've been waiting for a special occasion.

196
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,158
- What are these?

197
00:06:52,158 --> 00:06:53,208
- [Ellie] Well I'm gonna show you

198
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:56,292
what we're gonna do tonight, okay?

199
00:06:56,292 --> 00:06:57,864
Which one do you like?

200
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,411
Do you like the bear
or do you like the fox?

201
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,591
- I want the fox.

202
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,903
- Okay, Calvin can have the bear.

203
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:03,898
Come here Cal.

204
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:05,898
These are sleeping bags.

205
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:08,156
- What?

206
00:07:08,156 --> 00:07:10,850
- And the kids end up in our room

207
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,073
and in our bed,

208
00:07:12,073 --> 00:07:15,175
and I thought tonight, for Christmas Eve,

209
00:07:15,175 --> 00:07:18,185
it would be fun to put these on our floor,

210
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:21,040
and let the boys sleep on the floor

211
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,584
in their fun sleeping bags.

212
00:07:23,584 --> 00:07:25,240
Would you want to do that Jackson?

213
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,073
- Yeah.

214
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:26,906
- [Ellie] I think he likes it.

215
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,408
Calvin, where are you mister?

216
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:29,741
Hi Mr. Slowpoke.

217
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,794
- [Jackson] Mr. Slowpoke!

218
00:07:33,794 --> 00:07:35,253
- [Ellie] Come here.

219
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:36,836
Does this look fun?

220
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,097
Yeah, it's a sleeping bag.

221
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,379
Here, grab yours Jacks,

222
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,994
or grab yours Cal, come here.

223
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:46,339
And I thought that you guys might think

224
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:48,691
this is fun for tonight.

225
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:50,467
So tonight, when we get back from dinner,

226
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:51,346
it's gonna be late,

227
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,362
so we're kind of getting going

228
00:07:52,362 --> 00:07:55,229
with our evening telling
the kids the plan.

229
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:57,800
Do you think that sounds fun?

230
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,261
- I need poo.

231
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:00,651
- [Ellie] You need to go potty?

232
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,484
- Yeah.

233
00:08:01,484 --> 00:08:02,869
- [Ellie] Okay Let's go,
hold this, hold this,

234
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:04,401
let's go, let's go, let's go.

235
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,687
I think this is so cute.

236
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:07,520
Ah!

237
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,776
Okay, you like the idea Jacks?

238
00:08:08,776 --> 00:08:11,523
- Yes, I want to open my gifts.

239
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:14,036
- Okay we're gonna open the sibling gifts.

240
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:15,316
Is that yours?

241
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:16,149
- Yeah.

242
00:08:17,854 --> 00:08:20,543
- The kids just can't wait any longer.

243
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:22,302
They want to open the
gifts from each other,

244
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,727
which is exactly what we are gonna do.

245
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,616
We are actually doing our Christmas eve

246
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:29,630
a little early before dinner.

247
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,512
- Don't step on it.

248
00:08:30,512 --> 00:08:33,763
- [Ellie] So the kids won't
be too tired when we get home.

249
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,230
Okay Calvin, can you give Jackson his?

250
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,063
- Yeah.

251
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:40,581
- [Ellie] You hold it, wait for Daddy.

252
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,880
Okay you hold that.

253
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,512
Now Jackson come and get Calvin his.

254
00:08:45,512 --> 00:08:47,053
- Okay.

255
00:08:47,053 --> 00:08:48,470
- But it's heavy.

256
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:52,088
- [Ellie] These are the presents

257
00:08:52,088 --> 00:08:55,318
that the kids picked out for each other.

258
00:08:55,318 --> 00:08:57,401
Come here Cal, over here.

259
00:08:58,635 --> 00:09:00,892
- There's a little gift for you.

260
00:09:00,892 --> 00:09:02,634
There's a little gift for you.

261
00:09:02,634 --> 00:09:04,134
- [Ellie] Oh fun.

262
00:09:04,134 --> 00:09:06,092
- Mom loves little gives.

263
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,310
- [Ellie] Daddy just wrapped me something.

264
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,574
- Right here.
- Wow I like little gifts.

265
00:09:09,574 --> 00:09:10,517
- This is for Grandma Mecham,

266
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,191
and we're gonna take
this over to her house

267
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,999
a little later, okay?

268
00:09:13,999 --> 00:09:16,033
I think we should go--

269
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:16,866
What did you do?

270
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:17,699
We always did

271
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,431
youngest to oldest.
- Youngest.

272
00:09:19,431 --> 00:09:20,776
- You open yours.

273
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,509
- [Ellie] Okay, Calvin
can open his first, okay?

274
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:25,072
- [Jared] That was so
nice of Jackson to say.

275
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:26,949
Okay, rip it up.

276
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,053
- [Ellie] Okay Cal, start
right here on the side.

277
00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:32,805
Yeah, start right there.

278
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:34,860
- [Jared] There you go, now pull it up.

279
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,817
Good job.

280
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:37,778
Keep going, yeah.

281
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,626
- [Ellie] You want to grab
your knife for that tape?

282
00:09:40,626 --> 00:09:44,293
- See Mom and Dad, I've
got it in my pocket.

283
00:09:45,594 --> 00:09:48,898
- [Ellie] Wow, keep going mister.

284
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:50,025
- Is that a pocket knife Dad?

285
00:09:50,025 --> 00:09:53,125
- [Jared] Sure is, this is
one from Grandpa and Grandma.

286
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,160
- [Ellie] Is this from Jackson, Calvin?

287
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,993
- Yeah.

288
00:09:57,936 --> 00:10:00,769
- [Ellie] Okay, you open it up.

289
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,852
- Open it up.

290
00:10:03,905 --> 00:10:05,627
- A dog guitar.

291
00:10:05,627 --> 00:10:06,906
- [Jared] A dog guitar.

292
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:08,455
Did you hear him say that?

293
00:10:08,455 --> 00:10:09,307
- My turn!

294
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:12,391
- [Ellie] Just a minute, let him open it.

295
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:14,474
What do you think mister?

296
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,422
- [Jared] Strum it.

297
00:10:19,816 --> 00:10:22,687
- [Ellie] Do you like it?

298
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:23,657
- Calvin, let me show you how.

299
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:25,961
- [Ellie] He loves it, Jackson.

300
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:27,794
- Let me show you how.

301
00:10:30,214 --> 00:10:33,302
- He loves it.
- Watch Jackson do it.

302
00:10:33,302 --> 00:10:36,219
(guitar strumming)

303
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,223
- [Ellie] Aunt Bonnie had
one of these at her house,

304
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:43,328
and Calvin just about
went nuts not having it.

305
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:46,730
So when Jackson saw
it, he was like Calvin.

306
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,145
- [Jared] Okay, let
Calvin have a turn now.

307
00:10:49,145 --> 00:10:52,908
- [Ellie] Okay, Calvin
say thanks to Jacks.

308
00:10:52,908 --> 00:10:53,741
- Thanks.

309
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,867
- [Ellie] Wow.

310
00:10:56,765 --> 00:10:58,943
(strumming)

311
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,193
- [Jared] Yeah.

312
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,942
- [Ellie] Okay, I think you're
good to open yours mister.

313
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:07,354
You have waited all week to open this.

314
00:11:07,354 --> 00:11:09,076
- Every day, can we open a present?

315
00:11:09,076 --> 00:11:10,909
Can we open a present?

316
00:11:12,683 --> 00:11:13,516
- What?

317
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,067
- [Jared] Wow.

318
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,494
- I got a lot of stuff.

319
00:11:19,494 --> 00:11:21,244
- [Jared] What is it?

320
00:11:22,151 --> 00:11:25,401
This is what Calvin picked out for you.

321
00:11:26,412 --> 00:11:27,988
- What are these?

322
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:30,404
- [Ellie] Those look like little cars.

323
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:32,317
- [Jared] And what's this Jackson?

324
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:33,259
- Transformers.

325
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,144
- Transformers.
- Do you like Transformers?

326
00:11:35,144 --> 00:11:36,087
- Yeah.

327
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:37,059
- [Ellie] Are you happy?

328
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,347
- Mmm-hmm.

329
00:11:38,347 --> 00:11:39,180
- [Jared] Should we open one of these

330
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,785
and see what's inside?

331
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:41,618
- Yeah.

332
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,745
- [Ellie] What do you say to Calvin?

333
00:11:42,745 --> 00:11:44,328
- Thank you Calvin.

334
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,313
- There you go, yeah perfect, good job,

335
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:48,896
you figured it out.

336
00:11:53,313 --> 00:11:55,008
- [Ellie] Is it the same one?

337
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:56,841
- [Jared] Who is that?

338
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:58,540
- [Ellie] It's Tow Mater?

339
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,373
- [Jared] It's Tow Mater.

340
00:11:59,373 --> 00:12:00,723
- [Ellie] They're so cute and tiny.

341
00:12:00,723 --> 00:12:02,116
- [Jared] I think it's Tow Mater.

342
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:03,226
- It's not Tow Mater.

343
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:05,698
- No this is Smokey's Automotive Service.

344
00:12:05,698 --> 00:12:06,787
- Does he transform?

345
00:12:06,787 --> 00:12:07,933
- [Ellie] He does.

346
00:12:07,933 --> 00:12:10,064
Alright Daddy, you can give them these.

347
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,730
- Alright, here's Jackson's.

348
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,549
And here's Calvin's.

349
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:16,807
- [Ellie] This is from Dad, Mom and Dad.

350
00:12:16,807 --> 00:12:18,553
- [Jared] Can you open them up?

351
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,898
- Calvin open his first.

352
00:12:20,898 --> 00:12:22,663
- You can open it together.
- Yeah at the same time.

353
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,804
- I'm gonna open it slow.

354
00:12:24,804 --> 00:12:26,054
- [Ellie] Okay.

355
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,226
He's gonna enjoy it.

356
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:31,077
- What kid on Christmas Eve is like,

357
00:12:31,077 --> 00:12:32,413
I'm gonna open it slow this year.

358
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:33,293
- [Ellie] I'm gonna take my time.

359
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,494
- [Jared] Take my time, enjoy the moment,

360
00:12:34,494 --> 00:12:35,911
while it lasting.

361
00:12:37,432 --> 00:12:38,906
- Okay you're good.
- Here we go.

362
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:39,823
- What the?

363
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,393
Pajamas.
- What the?

364
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:47,931
- What's these ones?

365
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:49,678
I want to wear these now.

366
00:12:49,678 --> 00:12:52,355
- [Ellie] Okay, do you
guys wanna go get dressed?

367
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,044
You'll be comfy for dinner?

368
00:12:54,044 --> 00:12:55,465
- Does that sound fun?
- I'm gonna wear these.

369
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,184
- Okay, look.
- Let's go put 'em on.

370
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:00,322
- [Ellie] Guys, you're gonna
think the butt is funny.

371
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:04,216
Look it says no peeking.
- No peeking.

372
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,356
- [Jared] This is so fun.

373
00:13:06,356 --> 00:13:10,523
- [Ellie] Look at those little
slippers, oh my goodness.

374
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:13,619
- [Jared] You guys look so stinkin' good.

375
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:15,220
- I can't transform him.

376
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,833
- [Ellie] He's trying to transform it.

377
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,675
You boys look so handsome.

378
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,513
- Merry Christmas boys.

379
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:23,075
- Merry Christmas.

380
00:13:23,075 --> 00:13:24,776
- Should we go eat dinner with Ann

381
00:13:24,776 --> 00:13:27,267
and Grandma and Grandpa?

382
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:28,100
- Mecham.

383
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,124
- [Ellie] Yep, Grandma and Grandpa Mecham.

384
00:13:30,124 --> 00:13:32,486
You look so handsome.

385
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,460
Look at these slippers.

386
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,627
Okay let's go.

387
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:37,760
- Okay.

388
00:13:39,572 --> 00:13:41,806
- [Ellie] Do you want to
bring your guitar Cal?

389
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:42,639
- Yeah.

390
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,389
- [Ellie] Your ta-ta.

391
00:13:45,843 --> 00:13:48,198
- But I'm gonna bring transformer.

392
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:50,027
- [Ellie] You can bring him.

393
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,548
- I'm gonna be transformin'.

394
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:53,879
- [Jared] Whoa, are we
playing Christmas bingo?

395
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,062
- [Grandpa] We are, we're
playing Christmas bingo.

396
00:13:55,062 --> 00:13:57,599
- The second one is a candlestick.

397
00:13:57,599 --> 00:13:59,605
- Ooh, I never get the candlestick.

398
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,827
Boy you gotta jump over it Dad.

399
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:02,298
- I have a candlestick.

400
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:03,231
- [Jared] You have a candlestick?

401
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:04,318
Good job.

402
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:07,191
- Next one is the word peace.

403
00:14:07,191 --> 00:14:08,358
- Peace.
- Yay.

404
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,816
- [Jared] Do you see the letter P?

405
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,954
- I see the letter P.

406
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:16,505
- Yeah good job.
- Oh very good.

407
00:14:16,505 --> 00:14:17,554
- This is great.

408
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:19,384
We just got over to my parents house

409
00:14:19,384 --> 00:14:21,173
and we are gonna have dinner soon.

410
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:24,347
Ryan and Dad have been
cooking on the Traeger.

411
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,180
It's right out there.

412
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,686
Do you hear it howling?

413
00:14:26,686 --> 00:14:27,935
Some prime rib.

414
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,870
I love playing bingo, mostly because

415
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,055
- [Grandma Great] Oh the little baby.

416
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:33,678
- Is the baby Jesus.

417
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:36,225
- Oh I have the baby!
- Yes you do.

418
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:37,745
- Yay!

419
00:14:37,745 --> 00:14:38,777
- A bell.

420
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,768
- A bell.
- Do you have a bell?

421
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:41,998
- [Grandpa] Bingo!

422
00:14:41,998 --> 00:14:43,536
- I have the bell!

423
00:14:43,536 --> 00:14:47,133
- [Grandpa] Jackson, you have a bingo.

424
00:14:47,133 --> 00:14:47,966
- Bingo!

425
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,123
- [Jared] Yay, you got a
bingo Jackson, good job.

426
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,143
- You help Grandma Great
with hers now, Jackson.

427
00:14:56,143 --> 00:14:58,884
(laughing)

428
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:01,985
- Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

429
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,699
the next one is, the Christmas tree.

430
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:07,282
- [Jared] Ba ba da ba ba ba ba!

431
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,792
- What do you think?
- Holy cow.

432
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:11,068
- [Jared] That looks great.

433
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:13,334
Watch out gentlemen,
that could've been bad.

434
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,943
- Did you find that outside?

435
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,506
- [Jared] They did, they found it outside,

436
00:15:16,506 --> 00:15:18,742
can you believe that?

437
00:15:18,742 --> 00:15:21,578
- It was sitting outside
and we brought it in.

438
00:15:21,578 --> 00:15:23,465
- [Jared] Cooked and yeah.

439
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:24,878
- [Grandma Great] That looks beautiful.

440
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,018
- That's usually where you find meat.

441
00:15:26,018 --> 00:15:27,319
- [Jared] Yeah outside.

442
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:28,837
- In the backyard.

443
00:15:28,837 --> 00:15:31,393
- You know I just miss Jean so much

444
00:15:31,393 --> 00:15:36,038
and him telling all the
stories that they did.

445
00:15:36,038 --> 00:15:37,668
So he was a storyteller.

446
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,181
- [Jared] He was a good storyteller, yeah.

447
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,514
- Yeah he was.
- He sure was.

448
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:44,347
- As long as his eyes were closed.

449
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,536
(laughing)

450
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,977
He'd close his eyes.

451
00:15:48,977 --> 00:15:52,518
- You know, I didn't notice
that at first in our marriage,

452
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,802
but it was just later on
that he started doing that.

453
00:15:55,802 --> 00:15:57,925
And I used to think,
what's wrong with him,

454
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,943
why does he keep his eyes shut?

455
00:15:59,943 --> 00:16:03,898
Why doesn't he want to see
what's going (laughs)--

456
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:06,674
- He was in his stories.
- Yeah.

457
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,577
- You gotta envision is while you tell it,

458
00:16:10,577 --> 00:16:13,661
you know, and you just think about it.

459
00:16:13,661 --> 00:16:15,429
Do you ever remember seeing Grandpa

460
00:16:15,429 --> 00:16:16,893
and hearing him telling stories.

461
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,061
- Oh all the time.

462
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,230
If you knew Grandpa Gibbs,

463
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,552
you know he told stories.

464
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:23,666
We loved him.

465
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:24,499
- Yep.

466
00:16:24,499 --> 00:16:25,332
Get ready.

467
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:26,165
We just finished dinner.

468
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:28,056
And Grandma is gonna read
us a Christmas story.

469
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:28,889
- You ready?

470
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:29,722
- You ready?

471
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,687
- Okay, Jackson you ready?

472
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:32,580
- [Jared] Ready bud?

473
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,542
Grandma's gonna read a Christmas story.

474
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:35,554
- Grandma Great?

475
00:16:35,554 --> 00:16:36,591
- [Jared] Grandma Mecham.

476
00:16:36,591 --> 00:16:38,913
Grandma Great's gonna
listen, just like you.

477
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,830
("The First Noel")

478
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:52,662
Who are you?

479
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,653
You're Mary and I'm Joseph.

480
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:58,043
Aww kiss.

481
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:58,876
- Yay.

482
00:16:58,876 --> 00:17:00,274
- [Jared] It's fitting,
because you're with child.

483
00:17:00,274 --> 00:17:01,660
(laughs) Get it?

484
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,034
- Calvin's an angel,

485
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:04,499
someone should take that.
- Calvin's an angel.

486
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:06,803
(Jared laughs)

487
00:17:06,803 --> 00:17:08,554
- [Jared] Jackson who are you?

488
00:17:08,554 --> 00:17:10,230
- The wise man.
- Are you a wise man?

489
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,146
- [Grandma] Here's another one.

490
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:14,310
- [Jared] Oh two wise
men, double the wise?

491
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,971
You have the manger,

492
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,150
Maria, baby Jesus,

493
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,851
and Ryan, you're the shepherd.

494
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:21,709
- Okay I'm a shepherd too.

495
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:22,739
- [Jared] Yeah.

496
00:17:22,739 --> 00:17:25,528
Grandma Great, what are you?

497
00:17:25,528 --> 00:17:27,288
- I am a wise man.

498
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:28,560
- With Frankincense.
- Oh yeah.

499
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,844
- [Jared] Maybe we should
give Calvin's angel

500
00:17:30,844 --> 00:17:32,782
to Grandma, because--

501
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:33,671
- [Ellie] That would be more fitting.

502
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:38,381
- [Jared] That's more
fitting for both parties.

503
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:41,298
("The First Noel")

504
00:17:53,286 --> 00:17:56,909
Oh my goodness Jackson, this
is like Christmas morning.

505
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,860
- [Grandma] And who likes Frozen?

506
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,741
- Me!

507
00:17:58,741 --> 00:18:02,634
- [Jared] Oh wow, you got
Spiderman wrapping paper

508
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:05,308
and Justice League wrapping paper.

509
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:06,544
- [Jackson] I have this one and this one.

510
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,711
Yeah, and look, this one--

511
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,152
- [Jackson] Is for Penny.

512
00:18:11,152 --> 00:18:13,389
- [Jared] That one's for Penny.

513
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:14,639
That's so cool.

514
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:16,782
What the?

515
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:21,522
Oh my goodness.

516
00:18:21,522 --> 00:18:22,534
- It's a Batman blanket.

517
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,608
- [Jared] It's a Batman blanket, yeah.

518
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:27,252
That's so cool.
- That's beautiful.

519
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:28,095
- Thanks guys.
- You made that?

520
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:28,928
- Yeah.

521
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,926
- [Jared] That's so awesome.

522
00:18:30,926 --> 00:18:33,019
- He will love it.

523
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:34,424
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

524
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,016
- He also just loves the figure.

525
00:18:36,016 --> 00:18:37,216
- [Jared] What?

526
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:38,405
- Da da da blanket!

527
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:39,572
- [Jared] Wow.

528
00:18:40,609 --> 00:18:42,132
That is so cool.

529
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:43,188
- It's a big spiderweb.

530
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,375
- [Ellie] That looks amazing.

531
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,125
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

532
00:18:47,145 --> 00:18:49,019
- [Ellie] Say thank you.

533
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:49,852
- [Maria] You're welcome.

534
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:50,685
- I want to open this one now.

535
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:51,707
(laughing)

536
00:18:51,707 --> 00:18:53,534
- [Jared] Wait just a
minute, we gotta go around.

537
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:56,460
- Maria look Jackson, she made that

538
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,780
with her own hands.

539
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,613
Are you gonna go to bed with that?

540
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,179
- [Jared] It's gonna be so warm.

541
00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:03,685
It's Barry Allen and he's
the fastest man alive.

542
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,643

You see my shadow?

564

Ooh-wee-ooh.

565
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:03,618
We are all in our family pajamas.

566
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,213
We're all in bed.

567
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:08,516
And we're going to read a Christmas story.

568
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:11,140
- I was gonna read a story

569
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,698
in front of the fire,

570
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,848
but they all wanted to get in their beds.

571
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:15,938
- They have been dying

572
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:19,073
and Calvin was like, he never
wants to get in his bed.

573
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:20,283
- He always says, no Mama's bed.

574
00:20:20,283 --> 00:20:23,294
- He's so excited to be
right there right now.

575
00:20:23,294 --> 00:20:25,808
So we're gonna read a Christmas story

576
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,057
and say goodnight to these kids.

577
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:29,655
The First Christmas.

578
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:30,562
- I'm yawning.

579
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,669
- [Jared] Did you have
a good day today boys?

580
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:33,502
Yeah?

581
00:20:33,502 --> 00:20:35,051
- [Ellie] You guys have
been good all year.

582
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:36,086
- You've been so good, huh?

583
00:20:36,086 --> 00:20:37,044
Who's gonna come visit us

584
00:20:37,044 --> 00:20:38,814
while we're asleep?

585
00:20:38,814 --> 00:20:41,389
("Silent Night")

586
00:20:41,389 --> 00:20:42,916
- A babysitter.

587
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,010
- [Jared] A babysitter?

588
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,138
(Jared laughs)

589
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:48,272
What about Santa Claus?

590
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:49,615
- Oh yeah.

591
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,297
- Oh yeah, Santa Claus.
- Yeah.

592
00:20:51,297 --> 00:20:53,097
- I can't zip this.

593
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:54,561
- Can you tell that's what happens

594
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:55,633
when we do have a babysitter.

595
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:56,878
Now you're gonna go to bed,

596
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:58,989
but if you wake up, don't be scared.

597
00:20:58,989 --> 00:21:00,869
- [Jared] If you have a babysitter.

598
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:03,231
Okay, can you say goodnight?

599
00:21:03,231 --> 00:21:05,772
- Goodnight friends, Merry Christmas.

600
00:21:05,772 --> 00:21:08,242
- [Jared] Can you say goodnight Calvin?

601
00:21:08,242 --> 00:21:09,369
- Bye friends.

602
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,162
- Bye friends.
- Okay let's read the book.

603
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,365
- Alright Penny, consider yourself lucky.

604
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,276
You get to hang out with the big kids,

605
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,222

00:21:18,222 --> 00:21:20,684

We've got snacks here,

609
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,591
and Mandarin oranges?

610
00:21:26,591 --> 00:21:29,299
Clementines, whatever
they're called, mini oranges.

611
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:31,041
Some other snacks here,

612
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,514
and we're all ready for
hot cocoa in the morning.

613
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:35,917
Oh my goodness gracious.

614
00:21:35,917 --> 00:21:38,189
This guy's gonna be
our bed friend tomorrow

615
00:21:38,189 --> 00:21:40,246
while we are snacking on foods.

616
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:43,577
Penny, guess what, you get to be a part

617
00:21:43,577 --> 00:21:44,410
of the snacking too.

618
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,397
We've got some fun snacks just for you.

619
00:21:46,397 --> 00:21:49,394
We are just sitting here as a family

620
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:50,434
by the fire.

621
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,785
We're getting warm, and we're looking

622
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:54,785
at the Christmas tree and
the gifts and everything

623
00:21:54,785 --> 00:21:57,785
and I am just so extremely grateful.

624
00:21:58,681 --> 00:22:01,345
This is magical right here.
("Silent Night")

625
00:22:01,345 --> 00:22:04,678
Today, tomorrow is the epitome of magic.

626
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:09,899
And I am just so grateful
for family and friends

627
00:22:09,899 --> 00:22:13,316
in our community who make the magic real.

628
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:17,282
And make it fun and exciting.

629
00:22:17,282 --> 00:22:20,523
And I'm glad that we have
this every single day,

630
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:22,994
because it's magical to me.

631
00:22:22,994 --> 00:22:24,770
- Um, I amen (laughs).

632
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:25,776
- Yeah.

633
00:22:25,776 --> 00:22:27,001
- I agree.

634
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:29,155
I'm worried about your back,
it's so hot right there.

635
00:22:29,155 --> 00:22:30,308
- I'm hot.

636
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:32,365
- It has been so fun.

637
00:22:32,365 --> 00:22:34,397
I've loved every second with the kids

638
00:22:34,397 --> 00:22:36,647
and I just love being home,

639
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:41,962
making your home feel like that spirit

640
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:42,795
- Yeah.

641
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:45,560
- and it's just special and
I'm so grateful that our boys

642
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,114
are at such fun stages.

643
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:47,947
- Yes they are.

644
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:48,780
- Next year's gonna be crazy.

645
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,839
We'll have a six month old in the bunch.

646
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,672
Holy cow.

647
00:22:52,832 --> 00:22:53,665
Holy cow.

00:22:55,483 --> 00:22:57,240
How fun is that gonna be?

650
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,920
It's gonna be so great.

651
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,063
- I hope you had an awesome Christmas Eve.

652
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,065
I hope you had an awesome Christmas.

653
00:23:03,065 --> 00:23:04,490
We're gonna say goodnight.

654
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,905
Let's show the boys real quick.

655
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:08,238
- Okay, that's a great idea.

656
00:23:10,127 --> 00:23:13,077
They have no idea about tomorrow.

657
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:14,994
It's gonna be so great.

658
00:23:17,008 --> 00:23:18,575
- Thank you guys so much.

659
00:23:18,575 --> 00:23:22,074
