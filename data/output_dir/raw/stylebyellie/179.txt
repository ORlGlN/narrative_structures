1
00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:03,463
(bright uptempo music)

2
00:00:13,717 --> 00:00:14,933
- Good morning guys, happy Monday.

3
00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,516
It is feeding time.

4
00:00:17,358 --> 00:00:18,956
Ahhh, come on little birdies.

5
00:00:18,956 --> 00:00:21,456
(smacks lips)

6
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:23,290
Ah wait.

7
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:27,955
- This is how come
mommy's always eat last.

8
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,786
I offer food and they say no,

9
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:32,953
and then when I eat, they want to eat.

10
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:34,892
Oh.

11
00:00:36,027 --> 00:00:38,277
(laughing)

12
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,438
- Ellie you know what you need to do,

13
00:00:40,438 --> 00:00:41,758
you need to chew it up
in your mouth first,

14
00:00:41,758 --> 00:00:42,591
- Eww.
- before you give it to them

15
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:43,424
- so they can swallow it better.

16
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:44,257
- Okay, that's too much.

17
00:00:44,257 --> 00:00:45,152
(Jared laughing)
- You went too far.

18
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:48,319
(gentle guitar music)

19
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:15,379
- Oh no Jackson, are you okay?

20
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,980
What happened?

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,229
- I broke my knee.

22
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:19,468
- [Jared] You broke your knee?

23
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:20,828
Oh no.

24
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,606
What did you tell me we need to do?

25
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:25,618
- I need to go to the doctor.

26
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,148
- [Jared] Do you think
the doctor will be able

27
00:01:27,148 --> 00:01:28,203
to help your knee feel better?

28
00:01:28,203 --> 00:01:29,036
- Uh-huh.

29
00:01:29,036 --> 00:01:30,355
- Okay, I think we should do that.

30
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:32,315
Can I take a look at it real quick?

31
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:33,826
- Yeah.

32
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:37,211
- Oh ouch buddy, that looks like it hurts.

33
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:39,387
Okay, I think I know just the place.

34
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:41,944
Will you come with me and
we'll go see a doctor?

35
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:42,777
- Yeah.

36
00:01:42,777 --> 00:01:45,376
- Okay, but don't put
too much weight on it,

37
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:47,359
okay, we just got to
make sure it stays okay

38
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,000
until we see the doctor.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,833
Okay?

40
00:01:49,833 --> 00:01:51,285
- Okay.

41
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:53,005
- Are you gonna be alright?

42
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:54,594
Okay, let's walk to our bedroom

43
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:57,352
and I'll go get dressed, and
we'll go see the doctor, okay?

44
00:01:57,352 --> 00:01:58,875
Oh that's a bad limp.

45
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,331
Oh man, I think it switched legs,

46
00:02:01,331 --> 00:02:02,461
but that's still bad.

47
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,696
Oh there it goes,

48
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:05,406
oh man, I knew it was bad.

49
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:06,494
This is serious business.

50
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:09,949
We've got to go see the doctor right now.

51
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:11,918
What do you think Mom?

52
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:14,022
I think it's pretty serious.

53
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:17,070
Maybe not the doctor, maybe
the Ministry of Silly Walks.

54
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,070
(audience laughing)

55
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:30,726
- Jackson that looks really bad.

56
00:02:30,726 --> 00:02:31,752
Does it hurt?

57
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,633
- Yes.

58
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:33,987
- Here, walk to the couch.

59
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,207
Let's see how good you do it.

60
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,707
- Oh, ouch that looks painful.

61
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,138
- Do you want Daddy to carry you?

62
00:02:41,138 --> 00:02:42,145
- Yeah.

63
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:42,978
- [Ellie] Okay.

64
00:02:42,978 --> 00:02:44,228
- [Jared] Okay.

65
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:47,316
- [Ellie] Oh careful.

66
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,809
- Yeah, oh is it tender?

67
00:02:48,809 --> 00:02:49,642
- Yes.

68
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:51,934
- Let me go get dressed
and I'll take you, okay?

69
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:52,767
You just stay right next to me,

70
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,934
and don't you walk another step, okay?

71
00:02:57,622 --> 00:02:58,455
- I will.

72
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,670
- You will, why?

73
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,966
Well don't you think
that will hurt your knee?

74
00:03:02,966 --> 00:03:04,096
- No.

75
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:04,929
- Okay.

76
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:06,279
Do you want me to put you down?

77
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,112
- Yeah.

78
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:07,945
- Okay.

79
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:10,455
Careful.

80
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:11,288
- [Ellie] Careful.

81
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,200
- [Jared] Be careful Jackson.

82
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,212
Jackson be careful.

83
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:16,045
Oh.

84
00:03:17,532 --> 00:03:18,365
(ambulance siren)

85
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:19,456
Is there a doctor in the house?

86
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,456
Please, I need a doctor!

87
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:23,457
(coughing)

88
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:26,933
- Oh no, did you get a cough too?

89
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:28,100
You look pale.

90
00:03:29,304 --> 00:03:31,137
Are you gonna be okay?

91
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:33,901
- Did somebody call for a doctor?

92
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:36,316
- [Ellie] Yes, we need a doctor.

93
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:37,545
He's even is getting a cough.

94
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:40,191
I think his leg needs to be looked at.

95
00:03:40,191 --> 00:03:41,586
- [Jared] What seems
to be the problem son?

96
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:43,875
- [Ellie] You tell him what's wrong.

97
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,909
- My knee hurts.

98
00:03:44,909 --> 00:03:46,238
- Your knee hurts.

99
00:03:46,238 --> 00:03:48,166
Let me take a look at it, is that okay?

100
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:49,846
Let me have you sit up.

101
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,232
- [Ellie] Careful he has a cough too.

102
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,190
- I will be so careful.

103
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,464
How old are you young man?

104
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:56,297
- Three.

105
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:57,426
- Three?

106
00:03:57,426 --> 00:03:58,430
Is it this knee?

107
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,607
- Yeah.

108
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:01,411
- Or is it this knee?

109
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:02,993
This one right here, okay.

110
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,665
I'm just gonna apply some pressure here.

111
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:06,836
How does that feel?

112
00:04:06,836 --> 00:04:07,669
- [Jackson] Good.

113
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:08,960
- Good, does it hurt a little bit?

114
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,219
- Yeah.

115
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,052
- Did you here that?

116
00:04:11,052 --> 00:04:13,027
- [Ellie] Did you pop it in place?

117
00:04:13,027 --> 00:04:13,860
- [Jared] Did you hear that?

118
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,693
- Yes.

119
00:04:14,693 --> 00:04:16,168
- Oh I don't know.

120
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:18,536
Let me take a look at a couple things.

121
00:04:18,536 --> 00:04:20,308
I want to hear your heartbeat.

122
00:04:20,308 --> 00:04:21,589
Let's try here.

123
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,909
(heartbeat)

124
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:25,284
Sounds pretty good.

125
00:04:25,284 --> 00:04:27,677
Will you open your mouth
and stick out your tongue?

126
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:28,510
Say ahh.

127
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,906
- Ahhh.

128
00:04:29,906 --> 00:04:31,808
- Yeah, looks okay.

129
00:04:31,808 --> 00:04:34,003
Let me check you for a temperature.

130
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,336
Open your mouth.

131
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:39,953
Uh-huh, ooh.

132
00:04:39,953 --> 00:04:40,786
- [Ellie] Oh.

133
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:42,687
- Just as I thought, a little warm.

134
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:45,080
Not too high though.

135
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,827
Okay, now this, this is
a reflex hammer, okay?

136
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:53,696
I'm gonna hit your knee
and we'll see what happens.

137
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:54,529
- Ow.

138
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:56,982
Owww.

139
00:04:58,113 --> 00:04:59,338
Ow.
- Did you see that?

140
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:01,310
Did you see your leg move?

141
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,011
Let's see, so this right
here is a special shot

142
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,521
that's gonna make you feel better, okay,

143
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:08,771
and I'm gonna put it right on your arm.

144
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:11,930
Okay?

145
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,063
And I'm gonna wrap up your leg,

146
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,271
so it feels much better okay?

147
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,271
There we go.

148
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,442
- Is this gonna stay on me?

149
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:23,443
- It's gonna stay on your
for about a week and a half.

150
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:25,066
You'll just take it off for baths

151
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:28,317
and everything, but it'll
keep you nice and supported,

152
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:32,064
while you are running
around and playing, okay?

153
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,964
- [Ellie] That way when you
ride your bike, it won't hurt.

154
00:05:33,964 --> 00:05:35,214
- That's too much.

155
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,047
- Too much?

156
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:36,880
- [Jackson] Uh-huh.

157
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,992
- Okay.

158
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:40,992
How does that look, pretty good?

159
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,312
- [Ellie] Say thank you doctor.

160
00:05:42,312 --> 00:05:43,520
- Thank you doctor.

161
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,836
- You're welcome son,

162
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:47,151
just be careful when you're playing, okay?

163
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:47,984
- [Jackson] Okay.

164
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:49,234
- We don't want any
more injuries like this

165
00:05:49,234 --> 00:05:50,808
that can be prevented.

166
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,992
Oh there's one more thing.

167
00:05:52,992 --> 00:05:54,667
- [Ellie] How's waking?

168
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,500
- Its great.

169
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,082
- [Ellie] Oh good.

170
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:59,415
- Alright, give me your arm.

171
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:02,309
Put your arm right through here.

172
00:06:02,309 --> 00:06:04,612
We want to keep our arm right here.

173
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:05,975
- Are you a daddy doctor?

174
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,642
- I'm a daddy doctor.

175
00:06:07,642 --> 00:06:08,594
Okay keep your arm down like that.

176
00:06:08,594 --> 00:06:10,627
- Are you my daddy doctor?

177
00:06:10,627 --> 00:06:12,417
- I'm your personal daddy doctor.

178
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:13,942
Keep your arm right here.

179
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:17,137
- [Ellie] Aw, you look like
you're in good shape now.

180
00:06:17,137 --> 00:06:17,970
- Do you feel a little better?

181
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:18,803
- Yeah.

182
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:19,636
- Good, I'm glad.

183
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,989
- [Ellie] Thanks daddy doctor.

184
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:21,822
- You're welcome.

185
00:06:21,822 --> 00:06:22,700
- What's this?

186
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,470
- This is my mask, so I don't
get any airborne illnesses.

187
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,436
- [Ellie] Give Daddy a hug, say thanks.

188
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:27,269
- You feel better?

189
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:28,102
- Yeah.

190
00:06:28,102 --> 00:06:28,935
- Oh not with that arm.

191
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,422
You've got to keep your arm in place.

192
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:32,304
You'll get tennis elbow
until you're sixty.

193
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,420
- I need this off.

194
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,768
- Okay, when you're all healed up,

195
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:36,960
you can take it off, okay?

196
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,555
Now you listen to your parents

197
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,787
and follow the instructions
that I give them, okay?

198
00:06:40,787 --> 00:06:41,981
I'm sensing a little something.

199
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,314
I'd like to check over here.

200
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,416
(heartbeat)

201
00:06:49,547 --> 00:06:50,380
Just as I thought,

202
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,309
sounds like you're suffering
from a broken heart.

203
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:54,293
(Ellie laughs)

204
00:06:54,293 --> 00:06:57,132
Let me give you a hug to
make that feel better.

205
00:06:57,132 --> 00:06:58,452
- Thank you.

206
00:06:58,452 --> 00:06:59,956
I like daddy doctors.

207
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:01,507
(laughing)

208
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:03,442
Do you need a check up too Cal?

209
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:05,192
- Yeah, let's take a look.

210
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,307
Here you can just sit right here.

211
00:07:07,307 --> 00:07:08,140
Ready?

212
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:11,498
- [Ellie] Ooh.

213
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:12,331
- [Jackson] Hey daddy doctor?

214
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:13,482
- Oh, did you see that?

215
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,226
- [Ellie] Yep.

216
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,758
- [Jared] What were you singing?

217
00:07:16,758 --> 00:07:17,806
Sing that one more time for me.

218
00:07:17,806 --> 00:07:19,561

What is that from?

227
00:07:31,531 --> 00:07:32,364
- Hamilton.

228
00:07:32,364 --> 00:07:33,557
- Hamilton.

229
00:07:33,557 --> 00:07:36,974
That is so funny, Jackson
just started singing this,

230
00:07:36,974 --> 00:07:38,966
I don't know, like three or four days ago,

231
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:40,007
and every time I hear him,

232
00:07:40,007 --> 00:07:42,017
I get this big smile on my face.

You are so awesome.

239
00:07:48,743 --> 00:07:50,066
Do you like to sing?

240
00:07:50,066 --> 00:07:50,899
- Yes.

241
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,957
- [Jared] Yeah, what
songs do you like to sing?

242
00:07:52,957 --> 00:07:54,054
- Hamilton.

243
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:57,378
- Yeah, you know how me and
Grandpa sing songs together?

244
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:58,211
- Uh-huh.

245
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,710
- Wouldn't it be fun if you and me

246
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,939
sang a song together?

247
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:03,332
- I want to go pole vaulting.

248
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:05,652
- And you want to go pole vaulting?

249
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,485
- Yes.

250
00:08:06,485 --> 00:08:08,633
- Jackson you are making my
dreams as a father come true.

251
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:09,864
Thank you so much,

252
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,414
I can get so emotional and teary eyed.

253
00:08:12,414 --> 00:08:13,486
(Jackson yells)

254
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:15,129
But honestly I think that is something

255
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,640
Jackson and I should do,

256
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,352
just like me and my dad do.

257
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:19,185
What do you think?

258
00:08:19,185 --> 00:08:20,018
Should we do a song?

259
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:22,117
And if so, what song do
you think we should do?

260
00:08:22,117 --> 00:08:23,910
I'd love to know your thoughts

261
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,149
about a song that Jackson
and I could do together.

262
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:27,551
Let me know in the comments down below.

263
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:29,001
I have a couple of ideas,

264
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:31,504
but I want to hear what you think.

265
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:33,023
Do you know a song you want to do?

266
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,442
♫ One two three four five six

00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:35,594

269
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,081
- I want to do that one.

270
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:38,914
- Okay.

271
00:08:38,914 --> 00:08:42,197
I am continually blown away
by the generosity of others,

272
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:45,606
like seriously, our neighbors
have been so amazing.

273
00:08:45,606 --> 00:08:47,567
We just got dropped off a meal

274
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:49,504
by one of our sweet sweet neighbors,

275
00:08:49,504 --> 00:08:52,384
already made and ready to eat.

276
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you guys ready for this?

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,894
Okay we're gonna say a prayer first,

278
00:08:55,894 --> 00:08:57,950
but thank you for the generosity.

279
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,494
Everyone has been so awesome.

280
00:08:59,494 --> 00:09:02,312
You are already eating
before we said the prayer?

281
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:04,255
Well you're a silly
monkey pants, aren't ya?

282
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,359
Say Heavenly Father,
thank you for this day.

283
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:10,585
- Heavenly Father, thank you for this day.

284
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:12,003
- [Jared] Thank you for our blessings.

285
00:09:12,003 --> 00:09:14,463
- Thank you for the blessings.

286
00:09:14,463 --> 00:09:15,761
- [Jared] Please bless the food.

287
00:09:15,761 --> 00:09:18,060
- Please bless the food.

288
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,530
- [Jared] That will make us strong.

289
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,250
- That will make us strong.

290
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,983
- [Jared] Bless us to have a good night.

291
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:24,983
- Bless us to new night.

292
00:09:26,935 --> 00:09:29,731
- [Jared] And we say this?

293
00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:30,564
- Amen.

294
00:09:30,564 --> 00:09:31,814
- [Jared] Amen.

295
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:33,998
- Okay, let's eat.

296
00:09:33,998 --> 00:09:34,872
- Ready?

297
00:09:34,872 --> 00:09:35,705

306
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,263
- Yeah.

307
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:10,382
(Calvin singing)

308
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:13,558
- [Ellie] Get in bed, come on.

309
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:14,725
Grab your car.

310
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:17,717
Come on.

311
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:18,550
- Yeah.

312
00:10:23,553 --> 00:10:25,865
- [Ellie] Go get in bed.

313
00:10:25,865 --> 00:10:26,845
- Wait waita waita

314
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:29,429
wait a minute, I'm sorry, what?

315
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,478
What are these Ellie?

316
00:10:31,478 --> 00:10:34,091
- My sweet neighbor made
those cheesecake bites.

317
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,135
- [Jared] Is this the same
neighbor that brought us dinner?

318
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:36,968
- [Ellie] Yep.

319
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:40,944
- [Jared] There's
strawberries, frozen cheesecake

320
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:43,520
and then like granola stuff
at the bottom of this?

321
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,672
- Yeah.
- This is amazing.

322
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:46,353
- This is what we're doing.

323
00:10:46,353 --> 00:10:47,698
We're going to watch a movie

324
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:49,353
and we're gonna have these cake pops,

325
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,167
because that looks delicious.

326
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:53,174
Look at that, how fun is that?

327
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:54,854
And then guess what?

328
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,623
Dr. Mecham can use those little sticks

329
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,456
as tongue depressors.

330
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,578
- [Ellie] Totes.

331
00:10:58,578 --> 00:11:01,904
- So I have to talk to
you about Dr. McSteamy.

332
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:05,010
His name tag wasn't showing,
but it said McSteamy on there.

333
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,467
He was getting a little
close to you, okay?

334
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:10,289
And I just didn't like that
he was flirting with you.

335
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:14,018
- He was just making sure
it was all taken care of.

336
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:14,851
- That's my job.

337
00:11:14,851 --> 00:11:15,684
- But I won't let that happen again.

338
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:18,464
- Thank you because when he was checking

339
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,097
your heart rate and everything,

340
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,856
he went in and went straight
for the hug and the kiss.

341
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,321
It's a good thing he was wearing a mask.

342
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:26,856
I would've had to intervene.

343
00:11:26,856 --> 00:11:28,785
Don't be flirting with doctors Ellie.

344
00:11:28,785 --> 00:11:30,226
Don't be flirting with doctors.

345
00:11:30,226 --> 00:11:32,152
(laughs)

346
00:11:32,152 --> 00:11:34,581
Guys, if you didn't know it, it was me.

347
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:36,330
I'm Dr. McSteamy.

348
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,918
- And I kissed him.

349
00:11:37,918 --> 00:11:41,604
♫ I kissed a doctor and I liked

350
00:11:41,604 --> 00:11:42,721
- Nevermind

351
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,060
You wouldn't understand.

352
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,102
That kid, Calvin is such a stinker.

353
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:49,263
He literally came out
and I was like, oh gosh.

354
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:50,980
So I put him back to bed,

355
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,813
but before he got in the bed,

356
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,704
I was like you need to lay down,

357
00:11:53,704 --> 00:11:55,272
and he stopped in the middle of the room

358
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,852
and laid down on the
floor and just laughed.

359
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:59,820
He knew exactly what he was doing.

360
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,494
I was like, no, lay in your bed.

361
00:12:01,494 --> 00:12:03,301
And he got up and laid in his bed.

362
00:12:03,301 --> 00:12:06,828
What a kidder, like what
the heck is he thinking

363
00:12:06,828 --> 00:12:10,073
to make a joke at this hour, too.

364
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:12,522
No but seriously, how funny is that.

365
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,079
I said lay down,

366
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,480
and he laid in the middle of the floor.

367
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,770
Oh my gosh.

368
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,622
Okay, seriously though,
this nighttime routine

369
00:12:19,622 --> 00:12:21,382
is not what we're looking for.

370
00:12:21,382 --> 00:12:22,409
Calvin, get in bed.

371
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,097
It is 11:30 at night,

372
00:12:24,097 --> 00:12:26,001
and we've been watching a couple episodes

373
00:12:26,001 --> 00:12:27,377
of this show Parenthood.

374
00:12:27,377 --> 00:12:29,689
- I like it a lot.
- I'm still kind of

375
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:32,607
- I'm still getting used
to it and everything.

376
00:12:32,607 --> 00:12:33,623
But I just want to say

377
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:35,306
that I've had a really
great night with you Ellie.

378
00:12:35,306 --> 00:12:36,732
- You just like cuddling me.

379
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:37,565
- I do like to cuddle.

380
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:38,489
- And kissing my neck.

381
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:39,322
- Yeah that's fun.

382
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:40,292
(laughing)

383
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,040
But it's been a really enjoyable night

384
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,145
with you and I'm glad

385
00:12:43,145 --> 00:12:44,470
- Love you.
- we're together.

386
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,303
- Love you.

387
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:46,206
We're gonna end the vlog, thank you guys.

388
00:12:46,206 --> 00:12:47,653
- I'm not angry today.

389
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:49,229
- I didn't get thrown against
the wall tonight, guys.

390
00:12:49,229 --> 00:12:51,564
- No, not you, the camera.

391
00:12:51,564 --> 00:12:53,029
- We're getting blurry, so
we're gonna call it a night.

392
00:12:53,029 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
