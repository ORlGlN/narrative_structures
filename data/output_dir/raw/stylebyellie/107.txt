1
00:00:00,294 --> 00:00:01,127
- You ready?
(gentle music)

2
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:02,154
- I'm ready.

3
00:00:02,154 --> 00:00:03,632
I'm nervous.
- Oh my goodness.

4
00:00:03,632 --> 00:00:04,472
- I'm nervous.

5
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,123
- Let's get comfy.
- Get comfortable.

6
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:07,164
- Where's our hot chocolate?

7
00:00:07,164 --> 00:00:08,812
- We might be here for awhile.

8
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:11,028
Can you believe one year ago--

9
00:00:11,028 --> 00:00:12,242
- It's been a year.

10
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:14,159
- We sat on this couch.

11
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,987
Like I'm already gettin' emotional.

12
00:00:16,987 --> 00:00:18,466
We've been crying.
- We've already cried.

13
00:00:18,466 --> 00:00:19,299
- We said a prayer.

14
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:20,404
(laughs)

15
00:00:20,404 --> 00:00:23,143
We're like we want to
do this really smooth.

16
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:25,745
- We sat on this couch one year ago

17
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:29,912
and we said that we wanted to
change someone's life and--

18
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:32,194
- Little did we know,

19
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:37,018
seven other people would donate
an IVF grant alongside ours.

20
00:00:37,018 --> 00:00:39,467
And have seven people have the opportunity

21
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,800
to have a grant.

22
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,261
- Our lives were changed,

23
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,765
their lives were changed.

24
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:47,721
- We've met some awesome
friends this year through it.

25
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:49,633
- It's been an incredible year.

26
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:53,210
And we are so grateful
for that opportunity.

27
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,528
The blessing that we had to be a part,

28
00:00:55,528 --> 00:00:58,143
just a small part of that, you know?

29
00:00:58,143 --> 00:01:00,655
And what has come from
it has been amazing.

30
00:01:00,655 --> 00:01:05,489
Speaking of our families,
our IVF family, oh it's--

31
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,102
- It's been an awesome year.

32
00:01:07,102 --> 00:01:09,339
We talk to them probably every day.

33
00:01:09,339 --> 00:01:10,939
We have our own little chat with them.

34
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,891
And we contribute to our feelings,

35
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,347
they contribute their feelings,

36
00:01:15,347 --> 00:01:16,578
what they're going through.

37
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,771
- All of these ups and downs

38
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,666
that we've been experiencing together

39
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:20,770
throughout the past year,

40
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,539
we've been sharing with each other.

41
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:25,197
- And our relationships
have grown even more,

42
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:26,147
the last few months,

43
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:28,299
because a lot of them have started

44
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:30,066
their IVF process.

45
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:32,146
From last year, there is one baby

46
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:33,576
that has been born.

47
00:01:33,576 --> 00:01:35,528
There is two on the way

48
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,944
and our other friends,

49
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,777
the other IVF winners,

50
00:01:38,777 --> 00:01:42,928
they are in the middle of
their process right now.

51
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,793
So we are wishing them
lots of love right now.

52
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:47,145
- We are thinking about them

53
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,433
and we are praying for
them every single day.

54
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,560
Which brings us to this year.

55
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,768
2017 is a new year,

56
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:57,521
and Ellie and I have talked and thought

57
00:01:57,521 --> 00:01:58,786
this whole year--

58
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,180
- From January 1st, we talked
about, we did this last year,

59
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,459
and Jared and I had told ourselves

60
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:04,788
from the very beginning,

61
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:06,524
we never thought anything was gonna come

62
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:07,988
of sharing our story.

63
00:02:07,988 --> 00:02:10,189
Our whole life has completely changed.

64
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:11,661
We have two babies,

65
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,213
we've had two miscarriages this year,

66
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:14,869
and we have one baby on the way,

67
00:02:14,869 --> 00:02:17,943
and our whole life and
family dynamic has changed

68
00:02:17,943 --> 00:02:19,893
since we just got out of college,

69
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,631
just started YouTube and now here we are.

70
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:25,608
And we always wanted to do a giveaway

71
00:02:25,608 --> 00:02:27,307
during the holidays,

72
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:30,128
whether it was giving to the food shelter,

73
00:02:30,128 --> 00:02:33,022
donating toys, we've always wanted to try

74
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:35,997
and give back the most that we could.

75
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:39,158
And last year, it was a
really cool opportunity

76
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:40,725
that we were gonna do that,

77
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,665
and we thought, let's try it again

78
00:02:42,665 --> 00:02:46,113
and from January 1st we've
been talking about this grant.

79
00:02:46,113 --> 00:02:47,649
We've been thinking,

80
00:02:47,649 --> 00:02:49,711
we've been trying to figure
out how we can make it work,

81
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,562
we've been saving

82
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:52,645
and we've told ourselves,

83
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:55,981
we vowed together, like
if we're in this position

84
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:57,788
to do this again, we will

85
00:02:57,788 --> 00:02:59,087
and if we're in the position next year

86
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:00,560
to do it again, we will.

87
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,120
- Ellie and I sat down
and we watched the video

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,031
where we made the first announcement

89
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,198
of this whole IVF process.

90
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:11,191
And it came down to the
reason why we wanted

91
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,567
to do this is because over the years,

92
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,719
we have been given so much,

93
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,279
from family, from friends,
from our community

94
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:19,977
and we wanted to give back.

95
00:03:19,977 --> 00:03:23,070
And this was the most fitting way

96
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,903
- That we felt--

97
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:27,695
- that we felt that was
close to doing just that.

98
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:31,183
So with that, Ellie and I
are very happy to announce

99
00:03:31,183 --> 00:03:35,063
that we will be funding
another IVF grant this year.

100
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:37,919
(laughing)

101
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:40,046
It's just so cool

102
00:03:40,046 --> 00:03:41,977
that we're in this position

103
00:03:41,977 --> 00:03:43,546
and we don't know how
long this is gonna last.

104
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:46,433
But while we're here, we want to do this.

105
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:47,711
But not only that,

106
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:50,587
we have three other grants this year

107
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:53,806
that are already funded
by some very generous

108
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:55,227
and amazing people.

109
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,225
Zack from JerryRigEverything,

110
00:03:57,225 --> 00:03:59,251
the University of Utah

111
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:03,180
and the Utah Fertility
Center have all donated funds

112
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,588
for three more IVF grants.

113
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:07,582
So instead of just ours this year,

114
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:09,749
there is going to be four,

115
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,090
four, that's I'm very--

116
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,923
- Incredible

117
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,924
- Thank you to those that have been

118
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:18,430
so kind to donate again.

119
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,878
- Yes thank you very much.

120
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,888
Also a huge thanks to
Footstepsforfertility.org,

121
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:28,312
for being the foundation
that is making this possible.

122
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:30,687
For being the non-profit that has already

123
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,144
done so many grants themselves,

124
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:35,017
but they helped us out last year

125
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:37,865
and are helping us out again this year.

126
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:39,841
Now if you're ready to
just jump into this,

127
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:41,913
we'll have a link in the
description down below,

128
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,585
where you'll find out
all of the information

129
00:04:43,585 --> 00:04:44,418
you need to know,

130
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:46,023
all of the rules for this giveaway,

131
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:48,456
how to submit, what to do.

132
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:50,103
It's in the description down below.

133
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:51,915
The past year and the
last time we did this,

134
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:53,675
we learned a lot.

135
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,059
It was an incredible process,

136
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:56,955
it was a scary process,

137
00:04:56,955 --> 00:04:59,066
but overall, it was amazing.

138
00:04:59,066 --> 00:04:59,899
- It was wonderful,

139
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:02,467
like the people that we've
met and their progress

140
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:05,427
has been a huge blessing in our life

141
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:08,550
and it's been just the
cherry on top to share that.

142
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,021
And we did learn a lot from last year,

143
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,576
especially our first time
doing something so big.

144
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:15,696
- So big.

145
00:05:15,696 --> 00:05:19,120
- We've learned things that
would go smoother this year.

146
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,656
- So most everything is
going to stay the same,

147
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,712
but there are a few changes this year.

148
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:26,440
To start off, we want to hear your story.

149
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Just like last year, we
want to hear your story.

150
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,456
We want you to send us
a video to the email

151
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:34,450
ellieandjaredcontest@gmail.com

152
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,611
and send it through wetransfer.com.

153
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:39,182
You film your video, you
upload it to WeTransfer

154
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:41,896
and you send it to
ellieandjaredcontest.com

155
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,449
and we will receive that video.

156
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,686
The giveaway starts right now

157
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,780
and we will take
applications and submissions

158
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:51,910
until the 16th at midnight,
mountain standard time.

159
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,336
We will take the next week

160
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:55,090
to review all of the videos,

161
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,941
all of the applications ourselves,

162
00:05:56,941 --> 00:06:00,020
and we will announce
the winners on the 22nd.

163
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,532
We know that infertility is
not a location based issue.

164
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:05,877
It is a worldwide thing,

165
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:07,933
but just like last year,
due to legal reasons,

166
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,015
we are only able to have this happen

167
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,845
within the United States.

168
00:06:11,845 --> 00:06:16,254
Most national grants have a
$100 dollar application fee,

169
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:19,630
and this year, we have an
application fee of $20 dollars.

170
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,048
Now it's very important
to know that this does not

171
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,997
go towards us, we do not
get this money at all,

172
00:06:24,997 --> 00:06:26,942
it goes directly to the foundation

173
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:29,766
for the processing and
handling of the applications.

174
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,949
- This year we have
decided that the best way

175
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:35,062
to go about this, to protect and respect

176
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,352
everybody's personal
and emotional stories,

177
00:06:38,352 --> 00:06:41,801
and to make the process go
smoother for you and for us,

178
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:44,761
is we will not be sharing
the full two minute video

179
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:46,602
that you submit on our channel.

180
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:47,734
We know by doing it this way,

181
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:51,105
the process for us and for you
guys will go a lot smoother.

182
00:06:51,105 --> 00:06:52,627
Last year, Jared, I and his parents

183
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:55,139
spent hours going over these videos.

184
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,651
We had a worksheet for each
one of the applications

185
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:58,484
that we filled out.

186
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,354
That way it was the most fair way

187
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,586
to choose a winner.

188
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:03,602
- Another thing we've learned

189
00:07:03,602 --> 00:07:07,594
is that some clinics don't do
all of the process in-house.

190
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,142
Sometimes you have to do
procedures outside with medicine

191
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:12,629
and other things, so depending on a clinic

192
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,486
that you go to, there's a chance

193
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:16,287
that the IVF grant will not cover

194
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:20,166
that specific process,
but the main IVF process

195
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:21,556
will be covered by the grant.

196
00:07:21,556 --> 00:07:24,348
So to summarize everything
that we have announced

197
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:26,300
in this video, we are going to be funding

198
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,708
an IVF grant.

199
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,469
We have three other amazing people

200
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:31,332
who are donating grants as well.

201
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:33,220
Applications and submissions are open

202
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,396
starting right now.

203
00:07:34,396 --> 00:07:36,996
They will end at midnight on the 16th,

204
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:39,598
mountain standard time, and
we will announce the winners

205
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,170
on the 22nd on our normal vlog.

00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,378

211
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:52,513
We want to give a big thanks

212
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,865
to Footsteps for Fertility

213
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:56,089
for helping out, making this happen,

214
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:58,367
to Zack from JerryRigEverything,

215
00:07:58,367 --> 00:07:59,711
to the University of Utah,

216
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,513
and to the Utah Fertility Center.

217
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:03,138
- This has been a wonderful opportunity.

218
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:06,114
Jared and I have done awesome giveaways

219
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:07,729
and you know sponsorships

220
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:10,360
and we've already told
you, but we definitely want

221
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,470
to let you know this is coming
from Jared and I's heart.

222
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,387
This is coming from us.

223
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:18,638
No one else is getting paid,

224
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:20,190
we are not getting paid,

225
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:23,749
Footsteps for Fertility is
a non-profit organization

226
00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,005
that is helping receive the applications

227
00:08:27,005 --> 00:08:31,679
from you guys, and they're
awesome friends of ours.

228
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,149
This is just something that
we want to do to give back.

229
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,636
And this last year has
been the biggest blessing

230
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:41,036
meeting all seven of our awesome friends,

231
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,684
our awesome IVF winners.

232
00:08:42,684 --> 00:08:44,534
And I've loved staying
in contact with them,

233
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,684
and I hope that this year is the same way.

234
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:49,158
We hope you guys felt the love

235
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,336
that we are trying to give out.

236
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:54,521
We hope that you guys have
an awesome holiday season.

237
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:58,634
We can't wait until we get
your guys' videos to watch.

238
00:08:58,634 --> 00:09:00,715
We spent hours last year watching

239
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:02,827
and we're just excited
and we hope you are too.

240
00:09:02,827 --> 00:09:05,244
Thank you guys so much for watching.

241
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:07,429
- That is going to be
our video for the day.

242
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:08,533
We hope you have a wonderful day

243
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,853
and we will see you guys next time.

244
00:09:10,853 --> 00:09:11,868
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye.

245
00:09:11,868 --> 00:09:13,307
- Merry Christmas.

246
00:09:13,307 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
- Bye.
