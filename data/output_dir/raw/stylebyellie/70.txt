1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:00,943
- What's up guys?

2
00:00:00,943 --> 00:00:02,860
I am driving to the airport right now

3
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,190
because I am heading over to CES,

4
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,980
the Consumer Electronics Show of 2018

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,300
and it is pouring down rain today.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,320
Why isn't it snow?

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,590
I don't know, but it's making the drive

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,416
a lot easier than driving through snow.

9
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:17,999
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:20,499 --> 00:00:22,880
- I feel like a traitor this morning.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
I'm not eating boiled eggs,

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,050
I'm eating scrambled eggs.

13
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:27,950
I'm not using my Instant Pot,

14
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,875
I'm using my Crockpot.

15
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:30,708
Ah!

16
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:31,541
(laughs)

17
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,600
I'm making a roast today

18
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,430
and I actually didn't want it to be done

19
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,790
right way, I just wanted
to throw it in the pot

20
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,720
and let it sit, rather
than use the Instant Pot.

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,030
So that's the Crockpot.

22
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,110
Mister Magoo is following me around.

23
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:45,943
- Hi.

24
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:46,776
- [Ellie] You want more eggs?

25
00:00:46,776 --> 00:00:47,609
- Yeah.

26
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:49,350
- [Ellie] What do you want more of?

27
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,360
- More eggs.

28
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,886
- [Ellie] More eggs.

29
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,510
Arrr.

30
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,470
You're my Hulk baby.

31
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,040
Why do you always come up
to me and Hulk-smash me?

32
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:58,818
(Ellie laughs)

33
00:00:58,818 --> 00:01:00,158
Huh?

34
00:01:00,158 --> 00:01:02,190
And dance, you're a good dancer.

35
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,180
And go to sleep, goodnight (snores).

36
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,050
And clean my floor.

37
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,037
- So CES is basically the
world's largest tech convention.

38
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,930
Actually maybe it's the second largest.

39
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,070
Maybe the one in China is the largest.

40
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:23,730
Anyway, basically it's my place

41
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,340
that I've always wanted
to go to, even as a kid.

42
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,970
And I went last year

43
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,490
and this time I'm going again,

44
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,460
but not just as an attendee,

45
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,350
as a speaker and I'm
so excited about that,

46
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,935
because basically what this is,

47
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:40,199
is Jared, you're a kid in a candy store

48
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:41,730
and you're gonna have tons of fun.

49
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:42,850
I'm meeting up with a couple

50
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,410
of my very good buddies

51
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:45,410
and we've got some fun stuff

52
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,420
that we've got planned

53
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,370
for the next couple of days.

54
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm an idiot, I forgot
my wallet in the car.

55
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,270
That could've been really really bad.

56
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,400
Don't forget your wallet, Jared.

57
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
I know you do that a lot,

58
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,200
but just a reminder to yourself again,

59
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,408
don't forget your wallet.

60
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,408
(atmospheric music)

61
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:06,260
(beeping)

62
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,216
- [Man] Hi.

63
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:08,049
Thank you.

64
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:09,716
- [Jared] Thank you.

65
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:12,210
- Hi, welcome aboard.

66
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,250
- [Jared] Hi, thank you.

67
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,350
- [Man] Can I see your ID please?

68
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,650
- [Jared] Yes.

69
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,483
- [Man] I have your name here,

70
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:21,320
but it's not until tomorrow.

71
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,610
- So I don't know if you
heard the conversation,

72
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,470
but apparently the company that invited me

73
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,957
to Las Vegas only booked me for one night

74
00:02:27,957 --> 00:02:31,120
and it's tomorrow, not today.

75
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,890
So, a little bit of an issue

76
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,790
that we ran into tonight,

77
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,330
and we've got some work to do.

78
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,780
But for now, I've got to charge my phone

79
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,690
because it's dead,

80
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,290
and you can't communicate or book a hotel,

81
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,430
at a booked hotel, without a phone so.

82
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,821
- It looks good, that looks good.

83
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:52,039
- Okay.
- Do you think?

84
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,070
- Well I think so.

85
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,620
- So before you get like--

86
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,770
yeah, don't let it drip onto the bowl.

87
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,616
- [Mom] I'll try not.

88
00:02:58,616 --> 00:02:59,940
I'm just trying to get some good stuff.

89
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,964
- [Bonnie] Potatoes, yes.

90
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,320
- [Mom] Okay, here we go, one two three.

91
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,153
Woo.

92
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,890
You want a pretty one on top?

93
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:12,850
- Yeah let's pick a good
broccoli to go right here.

94
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,610
- Mom used to make homemade bread bowls

95
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:17,130
and it has been years.

96
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,690
I forgot about 'em.

97
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,810
They're beautiful.

98
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,260
So Mom and Bonnie right now,

99
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,450
they're doing a little photo shoot

100
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,300
and here next week Mom's
gonna come to my house,

101
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,910
and we're gonna do a pie photo shoot.

102
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,130
And then we're gonna wrap up.

103
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,570
We pretty much have all the recipes.

104
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,700
Have you gone to Ruby's yet?

105
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,090
- We're going--

106
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,371
- Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

107
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:37,204
- [Mom] Next month.

108
00:03:37,204 --> 00:03:38,200
- Yeah next month we're all going

109
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,670
to Ruby's for a photo shoot.

110
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,123
They went to Beau's,

111
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:42,690
so fun we are wrapping up

112
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,890
on this family cookbook.

113
00:03:44,886 --> 00:03:47,570
And it's been so fun to just hang out

114
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,496
and watch you mostly cook.

115
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,329
(laughs)

116
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,610
- I have to say I was
super nervous for a second.

117
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,880
I didn't think I was going to have a room.

118
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,600
Luckily the company that I am speaking for

119
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,030
saved the day, they really did.

120
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,960
So I'm here at CES

121
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,070
and I'm going to be speaking

122
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,490
for one of my favorite companies.

123
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,040
And this is so cool to me,

124
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,080
because all my life I've
wanted to go to CES.

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,610
Last year I came to CES as an attendee,

126
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,440
this year I'm speaking at CES

127
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,089
for one of my favorite companies

128
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:19,579
and that's DJI, the company that makes

129
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:20,629
these incredible drones.

130
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,830
They have asked me to
speak about their products

131
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,480
to all of these people at CES.

132
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,980
And I'm so honored and privileged

133
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,818
to be able to do something like this

134
00:04:30,818 --> 00:04:33,970
and it's just childhood dream come true.

135
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,140
Like if I told Little
Jared that I'm doing this

136
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,430
tomorrow, he would freak out,
and he wouldn't believe it.

137
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:42,030
Anyway, they saved the day.

138
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,620
I have a room now (laughs).

139
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,160
I can go to sleep.

140
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,770
But I'm not going to sleep yet.

141
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,820
I'm not going to sleep,

142
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,600
because I'm meeting up
with my good buddies,

143
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,034
Zack and Dan.

144
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:56,660
And we're going to do something
absolutely crazy tonight.

145
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,080
- I've spent most of my morning

146
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,220
with my mom and Bonnie
working on the cookbook

147
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,420
and the cookbook, it's not
just gonna be a cookbook,

148
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,580
it is a story.

149
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,970
There is emotion in there,

150
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,940
there's humor in there

151
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,070
and I kept telling my mom, I'm like,

152
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,310
even if it's just for the family,

153
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,330
this is so worth it,

154
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,300
because so many times I have called my mom

155
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,960
over the years and I say
how do you make this.

156
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,480
Bonnie makes awesome Sloppy Joe's,

157
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,580
she's given me the recipe,

158
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,280
I don't know where it is.

159
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,881
So to have a book of all

160
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,690
of our family's recipes is amazing.

161
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:33,180
If you guys don't have your grandma's,

162
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,970
your mom's, your neighbor's
chocolates that are so awesome,

163
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,020
some sort of recipes that
you love written down,

164
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,010
seriously write it down.

165
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,300
My mom, she's like if my mom was alive,

166
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,060
if she could have even more recipes,

167
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,600
she would love that.

168
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,880
So sometimes it just gets lost

169
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,840
down from generation to generation

170
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,030
and I just really like that
we're gonna have a spot,

171
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,560
one spot with all the recipes.

172
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,050
So it's been fun, I can't
wait for the next month,

173
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,570
we have a bunch of photo shoots

174
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,470
that we're gonna finish up

175
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,720
and then we'll be done

176
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,380
and then we're gonna get into the whole

177
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,800
making of the book, so I can't wait.

178
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,500
I'm gonna have to say that Jackson's

179
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,667
most used toy that he's
ever ever ever received

180
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,660
already in a matter of just 24 hours,

181
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,370
this toy he has played
with for hours and hours.

182
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,550
He went to bed late, he woke up early,

183
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,340
played with it, he's been so entertained.

184
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,100
He loves loop de loops,

185
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,360
place to store all the cars.

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,200
This is so fun, even Calvin
loves playing on it, huh?

187
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,534
Woo, that one flew off.

188
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:47,650
- This one can fly.

189
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,030
- [Ellie] What's your
favorite part of your toy?

190
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,480
Because there's so many parts to it.

191
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,750
Do you like the loop de loops?

192
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,140
Do you like the storage?

193
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,970
Do you like where it pulls the cars up?

194
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,930
- I love the rocketship.

195
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:02,130
- The rocketship, that's pretty cool.

196
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,540
I never thought I would say this,

197
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,190
because the most toys we have are cars,

198
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,200
like we have plenty of cars,

199
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
and all the cars in there.

200
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,980
So I never thought I'd say I think

201
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,170
I want more Hot Wheel cars.

202
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,150
But I think next time we
go to the grocery store,

203
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,350
I want to get some more.

204
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,630
Because I think it would be really fun

205
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,270
to fill this bad boy up.

206
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,010
How fun.

207
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,760
I just love this and I love that I can see

208
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,570
my old toys in here, my old
Hot Wheel cars that I had.

209
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,610
- You know what Dan?

210
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,440
It's always good to see a
familiar face in Las Vegas.

211
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,226
- That's right, on the Strip at 3:00 AM.

212
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,268
- At three in the morning.
- That's what we do,

213
00:07:39,268 --> 00:07:40,320
- two Utah boys.

214
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,930
- Yeah, we're actually right in front

215
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,390
of Planet Hollywood
right now with Mercedes.

216
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,380
We just came up in one of
these Mercedes shuttles.

217
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,780
And we're on the Strip.

218
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,970
And they have closed it down, like I said.

219
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,710
They shut down the Strip.

220
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,460
There are police officers over there.

221
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,651
- This is legit, Jared.

222
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:58,890
Just for us.
- Yeah, yeah.

223
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,740
- After we're done, they're
gonna open it back up again.

224
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,660
That may not be fully true, but--

225
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,840
- It's partially true.

226
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,250
There's some truth to these statements.

227
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,060
They've invited us to
come test drive this,

228
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,270
well not even test drive,

229
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,660
test ride this new autonomous vehicle

230
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,827
called the Mercedes Smart
Vision EQ fortwo smart car.

231
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,630
- So the question is,

232
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,820
I officially invited
Jared to come to this,

233
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,653
- Yeah.

234
00:08:25,653 --> 00:08:28,260
- But will Jared choose
me or Zack to be his

235
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,180
second person in the
car, that's the question

236
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,450
or will you just ride alone.

237
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,359
- Or will--

238
00:08:32,359 --> 00:08:33,192
- It's for two, though.

239
00:08:33,192 --> 00:08:34,620
- Or will I sit on Zack's lap

240
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,380
and we all ride at the same time.

241
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,390
That's the big question.

242
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,250
- I don't think Zack's
gonna go for that one.

243
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,679
- So you can tell from
the name of the car,

244
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,585
EQ fortwo, that actually
means it's a two-seater car,

245
00:08:44,585 --> 00:08:46,260
but it's completely autonomous.

246
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,927
I just looked at it, there's
not a steering wheel.

247
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:48,760
- No, nothing.

248
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,322
- Let's see if we can
get just a little closer

249
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,260
and see on the inside of it.

250
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,010
Look how tiny it is in the first place.

251
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,810
But there's no steering wheel.

252
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,440
It just drives itself.

253
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,350
I was talking to the guys
at Mercedes over here

254
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,560
and they said this is
the first concept car

255
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,260
from Mercedes in 135 years.

256
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:11,070
There's no steering wheel,
there are no pedals whatsoever.

257
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,240
That's kinda crazy to me,

258
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
because that's just so foreign.

259
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,830
Like I said on the videos,

260
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,500
watching those videos on the screen,

261
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,200
they're promoting something
that we're actively prohibiting

262
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,840
against right now.

263
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,700
And it's just cool to see the future

264
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,220
and being a part of it right now,

265
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,457
such huge dramatic changes in the future

266
00:09:29,457 --> 00:09:31,080
and I'm glad I can be a part of it.

267
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,130
So we're gonna go inside
of that pretty soon

268
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,710
and go for a ride.

269
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,070
This'll be my first time

270
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,600
in a completely autonomous vehicle.

271
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,540
I've ridden in a Tesla before,

272
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,990
but that isn't autonomous just yet,

273
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,540
due to government
regulations and everything.

274
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,825
Oh my gosh, it's going right now.

275
00:09:47,825 --> 00:09:48,687
Look at it go.

276
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:52,187
(bright electronic music)

277
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,360
- Can I race with you?

278
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,193
- Yep.

279
00:10:23,193 --> 00:10:25,580
- [Ellie] Let's put a
car up here together.

280
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,050
Go one two three, let go.

281
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,511
Whoa, you won.
- I won.

282
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:33,978
- [Ellie] Do you want to race me Cal?

283
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:34,811
- Yeah.

284
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:35,644
- [Ellie] Okay come over here.

285
00:10:35,644 --> 00:10:37,010
One two three go.

286
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:40,612
Oh no, I'm so far behind.

287
00:10:42,222 --> 00:10:43,055
- Whoa.

288
00:10:46,198 --> 00:10:47,767
Yeah.

289
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,684
- Mine won.

290
00:10:50,447 --> 00:10:52,697
(clicking)

291
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,020
- [Ellie] We are testing the cars to see

292
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,540
which ones fit on this

293
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,500
and we just opened up parking garage four

294
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,690
so that they will fall
into parking garage four,

295
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,370
instead of the top one.

296
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,910
These all are working,

297
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,010
so Jackson's taking them and parking them.

298
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:14,860
- Put it in there.

299
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,420
- Now it is the time.

300
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,831
It is our time slot to get in this guy

301
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,530
and go for a ride.

302
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,941
So here is just a quick look at the inside

303
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:28,000
of the vehicle.

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,620
It's very simple with the
seating and everything,

305
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,990
but there's just one
giant display right here.

306
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:36,430
And apparently, if this is your car,

307
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,840
it'll have your name and
have your information,

308
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,520
everything that you need right up here.

309
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,860
Looks like speakers on both sides.

310
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,060
Just a cool little car for two.

311
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,410
Uh-oh, the police are on the bus.

312
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,240
(Jared laughs)

313
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,470
They're getting after that bus,

314
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,110
that bus was not supposed
to cross that line.

315
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,000
Uh-oh.

316
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,470
Sorry, sorry.

317
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,960
That bus was not supposed
to be doing that.

318
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,130
They crossed that line.

319
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,100
Yeah, that's why we have
the police here guys.

320
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,770
Follow the rules, follow the cones.

321
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,470
I think one of the coolest
parts about being here

322
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,720
at CES is that each one of us,

323
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,880
Zack and Dan are here
for different things.

324
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,100
Zack has been working with

325
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,000
Huawei, cell phone company,

326
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,230
Dan is doing some stuff for Mercedes

327
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,530
and I'm here with DJI,

328
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,499
like we're all doing different things,

329
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:28,870
but we're here together.

330
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,230
- We're here together, not sleeping.

331
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,063
- Yes it is--

332
00:12:31,063 --> 00:12:32,600
- At three o'clock in
the morning on the Strip.

333
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,370
- It is 3:45 in the morning.

334
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:35,860
The Strip is shut down

335
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,890
and we're riding in an
autonomous smart car.

336
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,780
This is pretty cool man.

337
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,613
- It's great.

338
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:43,446
- This is awesome.
- No complaints,

339
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,630
- no complaints.
- Yeah.

340
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,910
- Shake Shack afterwards?

341
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,030
- Yeah, I'm in.

342
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,980
- It's my turn, let's go.

343
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,152
Oh my gosh.

344
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,381
(laughs)

345
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:54,060
These seats are comfier than I thought.

346
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,410
I thought they were all hard plastic,

347
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:59,010
but they're memory foam, that's crazy.

348
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,870
I guess one of the weirdest
parts about this car right now,

349
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,520
is they have a video playing,

350
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,850
almost like a YouTube video,

351
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,391
where it had like 5,000
views or something like that.

352
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:12,970
And that's just so foreign
to us on the road right now,

353
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,480
like don't be on your cell phone,

354
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,790
don't be watching videos
while you're driving.

355
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,440
But this is promoting that.

356
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,540
Like right here, look.

357
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,430
They're having a video, it has views

358
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,870
and that's just so different

359
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,430
than what we're accustomed to.

360
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,880
It's promoting the recreation
that we may want to do,

361
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,500
but we're not supposed to do.

362
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,929
- So I'm bringing my other buddy.

363
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:34,914
- Hey.
- Hey Jared.

364
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,747
- How's it going?
- What's up Jared?

365
00:13:35,747 --> 00:13:37,449
- I kept the seat warm for
you, I hope that's alright.

366
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,480
- Thank you.

367
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,520
- Oh the door's closing, look at that.

368
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,220
I feel like they should have the sound

369
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,839
like a like schwoooo, like a--

370
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:47,310
- Listen, there's a sound.

371
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,143
Like a spaceship.

372
00:13:48,143 --> 00:13:48,976
- Yeah.

373
00:13:48,976 --> 00:13:49,809
- Like we're in a spaceship
and the thing just closed,

374
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:50,706
- The airlock.
- Yeah.

375
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:51,960
- The airlock, that's right.
- And we're ready.

376
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,730
- Close the pod bay doors.

377
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,010
Okay we're going.

378
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,280
They just say okay go and it just goes.

379
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,200
Someone was sitting in front of it.

380
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,420
And it wasn't movie, but here we go.

381
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,200
- I'm driving, no hands.

382
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,270
We're not driving, we're not driving.

383
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:05,103
- We're not driving.

384
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:06,280
- We have no control over this car.

385
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,240
I don't really know what happens

386
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,520
If you needed to take over.

387
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,670
Maybe that's a question we'll
ask him, like what happens?

388
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:13,930
- [Jared] That's a good question,

389
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,370
because there is no steering wheel,

390
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,710
at least in this one.

391
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,543
- It's going backwards.

392
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:19,570
We could be going backwards
in the thing whenever,

393
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:22,355
and you wouldn't even need
to look, because it's,

394
00:14:22,355 --> 00:14:25,530
it's definitely safer
than what we would be in,

395
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,363
I would imagine.

396
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:29,440
- Absolutely, because
it's looking 360 degrees,

397
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,210
and we can only look so far

398
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,580
at one given time.

399
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,560
You know Dan, I knew at
some point in my life

400
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,740
I'd be driving in an autonomous car

401
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,720
and I also knew, that
it'd probably be with you.

402
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,989
- Hey, there we go.

403
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:42,950
(laughing)

404
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:43,830
Only the best for you.

405
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,400
We shut down the Strip for Jared.

406
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,560
- Well thank you.

407
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,631
They usually shut down
some things when I arrive,

408
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:52,410
but it's not usually for me.

409
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,380
- Like your hotel room?

410
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,710
- It's anticipation of me,

411
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,420
they're like oh Jared's
coming, shut it down!

412
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,870
- Hide all the hot chocolate.

413
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,740
Can you imagine, some
day a Las Vegas Strip

414
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,720
that just has these cars around.

415
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,950
You just go hop in and it takes you--

416
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,330
- [Jared] Where you need to go.

417
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,320
- It would look really cool.

418
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,430
We're going again?

419
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,410
- I guess we're going again,

420
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,650
hey.
- Yeah!

421
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,700
- [Jared] Hey Zack.

422
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,396
Hey.
- There he goes.

423
00:15:16,396 --> 00:15:18,646
(laughing)

424
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,170
And that's the thing,

425
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,337
we're experiencing a little
bit of the future right now.

426
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,960
It may not look exactly like this,

427
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,550
but it's gonna be pretty darn close.

428
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,620
You get in a car and
you just go, you know?

429
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:34,870
- Which I'll tell you, from the aspect

430
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,830
of thinking our kids' future,

431
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,776
- Yeah.

432
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:40,670
- I'm a little terrified for
when my kids are driving.

433
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,314
There's a lot of kids when
you turn 16 years old--

434
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:44,147
- Yeah.

435
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:45,616
- Whoa whoa whoa, we stopped.

436
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:46,449
- Oh goodness.

437
00:15:46,449 --> 00:15:49,074
- There's like a semi-truck right there.

438
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,230
And I'm like oh are we gonna stop?

439
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,340
And we stopped, I shouldn't doubt it.

440
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,173
- [Jared] Yeah.

441
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:53,006
- [Dan] Don't doubt this car.

442
00:15:53,006 --> 00:15:53,900
- [Jared] And that goes to the point

443
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,400
that you're trying to say, I imagine.

444
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,210
- Yeah, what if they're
distracted drivers.

445
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,020
A lot of kids are distracted drivers.

446
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,530
They need to put their phones down.

447
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,690
Well in this, the car will
come and pick up your kids,

448
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,005
take them to school,

449
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,010
you know that they're gonna be safe.

450
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,060
- Yeah exactly.

451
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,420
Probably, no not probably,
definitely more safe

452
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,290
than they would be,

453
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,799
especially at their younger ages.

454
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,632
- Yeah.

455
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:14,610
- When they're learning to drive,

456
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:18,390
when they're 16, 17, 18,
distractions are a huge thing

457
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,670
and this is avoiding those
and keeping them safe.

458
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,795
- And that's probably one of the things

459
00:16:23,795 --> 00:16:24,820
that a lot of parents,

460
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,150
I know a lot of adults are scared,

461
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,140
they're like oh I'm so terrified,

462
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,260
because even with our Tesla right now,

463
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,970
with level two autonomous,
people are so afraid,

464
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,100
I can't believe you would ever use that,

465
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,520
my wife doesn't even use it.

466
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,353
- Really?

467
00:16:34,353 --> 00:16:35,186
- But if you're at level five,

468
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:38,260
you would think that you would be scared

469
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,080
if somebody ever drove a regular car again

470
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,270
or even a level two autonomous car.

471
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:47,720
(laughs)

472
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,610
- [Jared] You may exit.

473
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,440
- We fogged it up in here.

474
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,752
We were too excited.
- Yeah we did.

475
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,180
(laughing)

476
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,730
- Oh Ellie I'm sorry, it
wasn't like that I promise.

477
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:57,000
It's not what you think.

478
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,351
We were talking about cars, autonomy.

479
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:02,791
- Talking about cars gets
Jared really excited, heated.

480
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,490
- Sorry we fogged it up
in there a little bit,

481
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,924
sorry Mercedes.

482
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:08,414
- Daddy!

483
00:17:08,414 --> 00:17:09,247
- [Calvin] Dad!

484
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:10,079
- Hi bud, how's it going?

485
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,729
- Where are you?

486
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,470
- I'm in Las Vegas, by all the Tesla cars.

487
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,750
- [Jackson] Whoa.

488
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,990
- Is that so cool?

489
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,823
- Uh-huh.

490
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:21,959
Are you having a good day?

491
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,890
- [Jackson] Uh-huh.

492
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,240
- I sure miss you.

493
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,410
- [Jackson] Yeah, I sure miss you.

494
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,820
- Can I have a kiss?

495
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,000
- [Ellie] That was a scary kiss.

496
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,060
My roast and potatoes and carrots

497
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,970
turned out amazing.

498
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,870
The gravy, I'm getting
ready for my second portion.

499
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,310
I just had a huge plate.

500
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:43,143
Just talked to Jared,

501
00:17:43,143 --> 00:17:44,600
I'm getting ready to have another plate.

502
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,490
I am so proud of Jared.

503
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,940
When I first met Jared,

504
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,750
he was such a tech guy
and he is such a tech guy

505
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,770
and all the jobs he's had before YouTube

506
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,180
has been tech-related.

507
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,390
And I'm just proud that he's able

508
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,320
to go and do something,
and be a part of something

509
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,160
and speak for someone

510
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,460
that totally is Jared.

511
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm so proud that DJI would want

512
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,280
to be a part of the
Ellie and Jared family,

513
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,520
like how they wanted to
film a commercial last year

514
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,510
and how they want him
to speak at this event.

515
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:19,180
It says a lot, and it's
amazing thing to have

516
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,100
on our resume,

517
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,330
and I'm just really proud of Jared

518
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,070
that he's able to go
and do something so fun.

519
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,900
Also, cherry on top,
hanging out with Tesla,

520
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,630
he's hanging out with Zack and Dan

521
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,680
is always so fun.

522
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,450
I'm just so happy for Jared right now.

523
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,020
I love you so much Jared,

524
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,580
I'm so proud of you.

525
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,747
And the first meal, the
first roast I ever made

526
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,670
was awful, and unfortunately he's not here

527
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,630
for the best roast I've ever ever made

528
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,475
in our whole marriage.

529
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:45,308
(laughs)

530
00:18:45,308 --> 00:18:48,808
So amazing and tender and awesome so,

531
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:50,520
you missed out Jared.

532
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,353
You missed out.

533
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:52,910
- Well as much fun as that was,

534
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,250
it's four in the morning and
it's pretty chilly outside,

535
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,970
so I think we should
probably get some sleep

536
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,090
before we have to be back
at the convention center.

537
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,150
What time do you have to be there?

538
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,654
- I have to be there in four hours.

539
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:04,140
- In four hours, so we'll get some sleep

540
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,310
and then get back to it.

541
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,070
- It's Vegas, I don't
think people ever sleep

542
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,903
in Vegas, including us.

543
00:19:08,903 --> 00:19:10,430
- Yeah, I guess that's true,

544
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,240
why are we even thinking
about going to sleep.

545
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,073
- Yeah, who needs sleep?

546
00:19:13,073 --> 00:19:14,120
- Let's go hit the slots.

547
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,953
- Wait a minute.

548
00:19:14,953 --> 00:19:16,740
- Blackjack, no?
- No.

549
00:19:16,740 --> 00:00:00,000
- Okay, we'll go to sleep.
