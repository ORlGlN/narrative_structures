00:00:02,083 --> 00:00:03,091
- Hiya.

00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:05,070

I want to eat some food.

- Go.

11
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:25,906
- [Jared] What's that?

12
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:26,739
- A church.

13
00:00:26,739 --> 00:00:27,906
- [Jared] A church?

14
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,665
You're going to church?

15
00:00:29,665 --> 00:00:31,010
Well you guys look all dressed up

16
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,658
and nice and ready to go to church.

I on the other hand, am not.

18
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,089
And I need to fix that right away.

19
00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:37,922
Should we try this out?

20
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:39,726
Ready, one two three (snaps)

21
00:00:39,726 --> 00:00:42,013
Okay, here we are, I am dressed up,

22
00:00:42,013 --> 00:00:43,479
ready to go.

23
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,767
Uh, where's my family?

24
00:00:44,767 --> 00:00:46,729
My family, where are they?

25
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:48,723
Oh my gosh, we are gonna
be late for church.

26
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:50,409
Let's grab our stuff, I got the iPad.

27
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:51,406
Are you guys ready?

28
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:54,178
Oh they're leaving without me!

29
00:00:54,178 --> 00:00:55,428
Ah we gotta go!

30
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,377
Oh I'm slipping around in my shoes.

31
00:00:59,377 --> 00:01:00,979
You weren't gonna leave
without me, were you?

32
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,918
- Mmm-mmm.

33
00:01:01,918 --> 00:01:02,951
- [Jared] You were about to.

34
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:03,784
(muffled speaking)

35
00:01:03,784 --> 00:01:04,617
What?

36
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:06,389
(muffled speaking)

37
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,313
I'm pregnant, and I'm gonna eat some food.

38
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:10,610

(Jackson yelling)

43
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,146
- Jackson (laughs),

44
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:24,313
I'm waiting for a good moment to talk,

45
00:01:25,258 --> 00:01:27,993
'cause he's singing while
he's going to the bathroom.

46
00:01:27,993 --> 00:01:29,602
We just got back from church

47
00:01:29,602 --> 00:01:31,193
and I just took my nylons off.

48
00:01:31,193 --> 00:01:32,636
I texted Julie and I was like,

49
00:01:32,636 --> 00:01:34,863
I am not wearing nylons anymore.

50
00:01:34,863 --> 00:01:38,513
I need to buy some nylons.
(Jackson singing)

51
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:41,347
Well it's cold here, so I
really want to wear nylons.

52
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:45,844
I need to buy like knee high
or like thigh high nylons.

53
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:47,707
I've been at church and I brought snacks

54
00:01:47,707 --> 00:01:49,881
and my nylons were digging in my stomach

55
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:52,161
and it hurt so bad.

56
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:54,379
Jackson, can you guys hear him singing?

57
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,809
So I have to buy some nylons.

58
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,361
I need to look them up now,

59
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,429
so I don't forget.

60
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,246
So next Sunday I won't like be hurting.

61
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:04,366
And usually on Sundays, we
really try not to go out.

62
00:02:04,366 --> 00:02:05,838
We don't go out to eat,

63
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:07,270
we usually don't hang out with friends.

64
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,783
Like we really just were home,

65
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,640
we go to church and we come home

66
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,481
and just spend time together.

67
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:15,465
And usually I have a meal cooked,

68
00:02:15,465 --> 00:02:18,737
but I've been having a really hard time

69
00:02:18,737 --> 00:02:21,393
cooking the last few days,

70
00:02:21,393 --> 00:02:25,780
just smells, being in
the kitchen, standing.

71
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:29,117
I've been getting a lot
of salads and eating.

72
00:02:29,117 --> 00:02:30,078
I've got Costa Vida, I've ate,

73
00:02:30,078 --> 00:02:30,961
that's been yummy.

74
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,292
It's just like whatever
sounds good in the moment,

75
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:34,914
that's what I eat,

76
00:02:34,914 --> 00:02:36,750
and I brought some--

77
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,834
I'm like shaking right now.

78
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:40,661
Can you tell I'm shaking?

79
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:42,965
I went to church, or I ate,

80
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:45,278
I went to church, and I
brought some snacks to church,

81
00:02:45,278 --> 00:02:47,158
and then 10 minutes before we got out,

82
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,198
I was like, I need to eat now,

83
00:02:49,198 --> 00:02:50,590
I need to eat now,

84
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,789
and on the way home from church,

85
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,903
I'm like, well let's just
stop and get mashed potatoes,

86
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:56,018
gravy and cole slaw from KFC,

87
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:57,035
so that's what I've been eating

88
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:59,252
and it tastes so good to me.

89
00:02:59,252 --> 00:03:00,085
(laughs)

90
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:02,484
But I'm still just shaky
because I'm hungry.

91
00:03:02,484 --> 00:03:04,148
And I told one of my friends at church,

92
00:03:04,148 --> 00:03:05,619
I was like, I'm sorry for the text

93
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,843
I sent so late at night.

94
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:10,531
I fell asleep, in my robe, in my jammies,

95
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:12,929
on top of the bed last night,

96
00:03:12,929 --> 00:03:15,290
because I get so dizzy at night,

97
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,186
just so dizzy.

98
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:18,868
And I take my pre-natal pills at night,

99
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:21,788
but I never noticed
that it makes me dizzy.

100
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:23,075
So I don't know if it's just right now

101
00:03:23,075 --> 00:03:24,507
taking pre-natal pills at night

102
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:25,340
that's making me dizzy,

103
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,518
or if it's me just being dizzy.

104
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:29,366
But I was so dizzy,

105
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:33,004
and I fell asleep and
then I woke up at 11,

106
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,491
wandered to the bathroom

107
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:36,557
and then was texting everyone back

108
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:38,818
that had texted me between seven and 10,

109
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:41,311
not realizing it was so late.

110
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:42,330
And it was I just like,

111
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,786
I just felt kinda dumb so.

112
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:45,875
I'm in my element now.

113
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:46,708
I feel better.

114
00:03:46,708 --> 00:03:48,398
I'm just sitting eating.

115
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:51,211
(laughing)

116
00:03:51,211 --> 00:03:52,662
I feel like a little hot mess.

117
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:53,647
Hi.

118
00:03:53,647 --> 00:03:54,760
- Hi.

119
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,503
There are two truths to that statement,

120
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:59,595
you are little and you are hot.

121
00:03:59,595 --> 00:04:00,795
0hhh (laughs).

122
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:01,982
- You are a dork.

123
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,184
Jared's charging his drone.

124
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,579
- Wee.
- We're gonna

125
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,412
- [Ellie] Hi.

126
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,245
- Hi.

127
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,843
- [Ellie] Do you need us to wipe you up?

128
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,444
- I just wiped.

129
00:04:11,444 --> 00:04:12,277
- [Ellie] You did?

130
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:13,110
Did Dad help?

131
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,943
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

132
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:15,638
- [Ellie] Okay, let's wash
your hands and we'll eat.

133
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:16,844
- Yes we're grabbing the drones,

134
00:04:16,844 --> 00:04:19,569
and we're taking them over
to the neighbor's house.

135
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:21,985
So they can try the drones.
- They can look at--

136
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:23,374
- and see what they like.
- And see what they like.

137
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,948
- We're gonna drone neighbor house?

138
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:26,649
- Okay, let's wipe you up.
- Yeah, you wanna come?

139
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:27,482
- [Ellie] Let's wipe you up.

140
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:28,315
- [Jared] Let's wash
your hands, come here.

141
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:29,148
- By saying let's wipe you up,

142
00:04:29,148 --> 00:04:30,125
I'm saying Daddy wipe you up,

143
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,083
because I don't know if I can get up.

144
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:32,916
Shut up right now.

145
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,726
- We'll all do a community,
but you do it Dad.

146
00:04:34,726 --> 00:04:35,809
(laughs)

147
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,531
- I'm gonna finish eating.

148
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:38,364
- Hey bud.

149
00:04:38,364 --> 00:04:39,197
- Hi.

150
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:40,030
- What are you doing?

151
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,899
- I'm rescue droning.
(drone buzzing)

152
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,287
- You're rescue droning?

153
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,128
Jackson and I just finished
with the neighbors.

154
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:47,526
We were showing them the drone.

155
00:04:47,526 --> 00:04:49,913
And Jackson is flying DJI Spark right now,

156
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,189
and he's actually doing
really really good.

157
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:53,254
Are you having fun, bud?

158
00:04:53,254 --> 00:04:54,464
- Yeah.

159
00:04:54,464 --> 00:04:56,027
(laughs)

160
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,961
- He's flying this drone all by himself

161
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,640
and he's doing awesome.

162
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,074
I'm so proud of him.

163
00:05:01,074 --> 00:05:01,977
Good job bud.

164
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:04,681
Jackson and I just got back inside

165
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,342
from flying the drones

166
00:05:06,342 --> 00:05:08,607
And I can't find Ellie anywhere,

167
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:12,024
but I think she's in the bedroom resting.

168
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:17,435
It is six o'clock at night,

169
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:21,129
and Calvin fell asleep on
the way home from church.

170
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,449
That was like at 4:00 PM.

171
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:25,665
So he's been asleep for two hours.

172
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:27,555
That means Calvin is either gonna wake up

173
00:05:27,555 --> 00:05:30,458
really early this evening

174
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,282
and have a really late night,

175
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:34,906
or he's gonna sleep through all of this

176
00:05:34,906 --> 00:05:37,418
and wake up super early in the morning.

177
00:05:37,418 --> 00:05:39,105
And I have no idea what to do.
- Ice skating.

178
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:40,462
- What do you do in that situation?

179
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:41,477
- Ice skating.

180
00:05:41,477 --> 00:05:42,845
- [Jared] Oh is that what
you do in that situation,

181
00:05:42,845 --> 00:05:44,789
you ice skate with two rags on your feet?

182
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:45,622
- Yeah.

183
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:46,995
- [Jared] That seems like a good idea.

184
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:51,162
("The Nutcracker, Dance of the Mirlitons")

185
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,084
But now you guys know more or less

186
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:20,260
why Ellie has been
caught sleeping so much.

187
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,228
It's because she's pregnant.

188
00:06:23,228 --> 00:06:26,311
40 minutes later, he's finally awake.

189
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:30,081
(laughs) Jackson what are we watching?

190
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,000
- Willie and the Chocolate Factory.

191
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,613
- Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.

192
00:06:33,613 --> 00:06:35,263
And what did you tell me you wanted to do?

193
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,930
- I want to jump in the
TV and go see Wonka.

194
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:42,866
- You want to go in the TV and see Wonka?

195
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:43,714
Do you like the factory?

196
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:44,610
- Yeah.

197
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,003
- Yeah, I want to live there too, buddy.

198
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:47,948
- Yeah.

199
00:06:47,948 --> 00:06:49,955
- [Jared] What would you
do with all that chocolate?

200
00:06:49,955 --> 00:06:50,788
- Eat it.

201
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:51,730
- Eat it?

202
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,230

203
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:58,931

00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:02,370
You want to try again?

206
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,625
I want you to sing really really loud

207
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,191
this time okay?

208
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,024
- Not too loud.

209
00:07:06,024 --> 00:07:08,214

210
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:10,714

214
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,310
That song has been stuck in my head

215
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,219
for like the past three days.

216
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:28,652
How long, was that yesterday?

217
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:30,113
- Two days ago.
- That's two days.

218
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:31,065
- I really like it.

219
00:07:31,065 --> 00:07:33,082
The music in that movie is so good.

220
00:07:33,082 --> 00:07:33,915
- [Ellie] It is.

221
00:07:33,915 --> 00:07:37,172
- But I don't like the
people who are skeletons.

222
00:07:37,172 --> 00:07:39,917
- [Ellie] The skeletons,
yeah scared ya a little, huh?

223
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,003
- And they're kind of in the whole movie.

224
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,322
What skeleton scared you the most?

225
00:07:44,322 --> 00:07:45,812
- The bad dead guy.

226
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:46,665
(Calvin vocalizing)

227
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:49,582
I remember that little bad rancher,

228
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:54,289
what happened to that skeleton.

229
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,336
- What happened to the
skeleton's eyeballs?

230
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,394
- In his mouth.

231
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,984
- They went in his mouth.

232
00:07:58,984 --> 00:07:59,817
- [Ellie] If you guys haven't seen Coco,

233
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:01,410
it's a cute movie.

234
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,697
- It's a cute movie.

235
00:08:02,697 --> 00:08:03,530

236
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,090

237
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,373
(humming)

238
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:09,358
- Fine, I'll kiss you.

239
00:08:09,358 --> 00:08:10,254
- No.

240
00:08:10,254 --> 00:08:11,587
- I'll kiss you.

241
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:14,161
- Mommy.

242
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:17,258
- He does that guys so much,

243
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:18,922
and I've been wanting to catch it on film

244
00:08:18,922 --> 00:08:19,755
for so long.

245
00:08:19,755 --> 00:08:20,692
And he just tried to kiss me,

246
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:22,511

248
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:25,244
He is so cuddly.

249
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:32,694
You are the cuddliest child
(Calvin vocalizing)

250
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:37,134
I have ever met, ever.

251
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,585
He loves his brother.

252
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:44,410
He loves to cuddle and wrestle.

253
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:45,915
He loves his Daddy.

254
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:48,482
I mean he is such a Mama's boy.

255
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:49,982
He loves his Mama.

256
00:08:51,986 --> 00:08:52,903
You mister.

257
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,712
I like your hair too.

258
00:08:55,712 --> 00:08:57,280
I like all the waves.

259
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,710
- Yeah, mine.

260
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,483
- [Ellie] Now, we all took naps,

261
00:09:00,483 --> 00:09:02,698
well me and you did.

262
00:09:02,698 --> 00:09:04,531
And we stayed up late.

263
00:09:05,915 --> 00:09:07,665
We stayed up so late.

264
00:09:09,934 --> 00:09:12,398
We gotta go get a little drink.

265
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,649
And then we'll say our prayers.

266
00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:15,226
- No, juice.

267
00:09:15,226 --> 00:09:16,059
- [Ellie] You want juice?

268
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:16,892
- Yeah.

269
00:09:16,892 --> 00:09:18,974
- [Ellie] Oh good grief.

270
00:09:18,974 --> 00:09:21,358
And then we're gonna say our prayers.

271
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:25,071
Can you show me how you say your prayers?

272
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,949
- Juice, choc.

273
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:29,893
- [Ellie] Did you just pray
for juice and chocolate milk?

274
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:30,859
- Yeah.

275
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:33,534
- [Ellie] Fold your arms
and show me how you pray.

276
00:09:33,534 --> 00:09:35,284
- Juice, juice, choc,

277
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:38,066
choc, choc,

278
00:09:39,665 --> 00:09:40,498
and choc.

279
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,331
- [Ellie] Amen.

280
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,645
- Choc.

281
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:43,478
(Ellie laughs)

282
00:09:43,478 --> 00:09:44,666
- Juice.

283
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,574
Orange juice--

284
00:09:45,574 --> 00:09:47,678
- Stop praying for juice.

285
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:49,048
(Ellie laughing)

286
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:52,348
That's not how you say a prayer.

287
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:53,412
- Juice choc.

288
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,663
- I guess if that's what
you want to pray for,

289
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:56,913
you can.
- Choc.

290
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:58,629
- Choc.

291
00:09:58,629 --> 00:09:59,495
- He can't decide if he wants juice

292
00:09:59,495 --> 00:10:01,806
or chocolate milk.

293
00:10:01,806 --> 00:10:04,632
(vocalizing) Choc.

294
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:07,152
Okay, should we say
goodbye to our friends.

295
00:10:07,152 --> 00:10:07,985
- Bye.

296
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:09,290
- Bye guys.

297
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:12,674

321
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:52,793
