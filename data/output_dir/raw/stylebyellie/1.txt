1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,654
- I wanna tell the story
of how we first met.

2
00:00:02,654 --> 00:00:04,607
- See the shark!

3
00:00:04,607 --> 00:00:06,850
- It's been a 10-year reunion!

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,580
- [Jackson] Hammerhead shark!

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,704
- [Ellie] You're gonna what?

6
00:00:09,704 --> 00:00:11,010
- I'm gonna put my butt...
- [Ellie] (laughs)

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,360
On the sand?
- Yep.

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,380
- Kay, let's see this.

9
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,960
We have kinetic sand in here

10
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,160
with their trucks and their rocks

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,130
and this has been an activity

12
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,710
that they have been playing with

13
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,350
for hours the last few
weeks, they love it!

14
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,310
It's just has kept them entertained

15
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,150
and spring is here, guys.

16
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:30,900
It is supposed to get
super warm this week,

17
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,060
but especially warm
with where we're going.

18
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:37,438
Ready to give me a sand
bath foot pedicure?

19
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:38,800
Is that what you're gonna do?

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,289
- [Jackson] No.
- [Ellie] Oh, it's cold!

21
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:41,260
(shivers)

22
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,177
- Mommy, you have to stand up and do it.

23
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:46,087
Sit your butt on it.
- [Ellie] No (laughs)

24
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,006
- Why?

25
00:00:47,006 --> 00:00:48,130
- I'm too big!

26
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,914
I can't fit in the bucket.

27
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,400
- [Jackson] Okay, get out.

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,570
- [Jared] Ready?

29
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,495
On your mark, get set, take a break!

30
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:58,970
(laughs)

31
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,830
Good girl, Penny, you love
it out here, don't ya?

32
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,590
Come on, Ferdinand!

33
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:04,800
Let's get going on our walk.

34
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,200
We don't have all day to
stop and smell the roses!

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,700
Or in this case the tumbleweed, the weeds.

36
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,380
- Jared is just finishing up some work

37
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,030
before we head to the airport,

38
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,840
and I wanna show you the beautiful picture

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,660
that Jackson and Calvin drew.

40
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,270
Jesus. Jackson was so good, like,

41
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,940
he was going really slow and
patient staying in the lines

42
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,070
and then they got really excited,

43
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,000
but that looks awesome.

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,660
So we're coloring Jesus

45
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,634
and Jackson is tracing letters again.

46
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:33,467
(Calvin mumbles)

47
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:36,283
Oh, you're even tracing the
three, that looks awesome!

48
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,340
- Mommy, so tall!

49
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,490
- [Ellie] It is tall.
(Calvin mumbles)

50
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,330
Wow!

51
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,802
Hello! Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

52
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:46,420
(upbeat music)

53
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,050
- Kay, are we going
straight or are we turning?

54
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,883
- Straight.

55
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:52,301
- Kay, go straight, keep
your eye on the road.

56
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,460
(giggles)

57
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,640
- [Jared] What do we do
at the lights, Jackson?

58
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,473
It's red.

59
00:01:57,722 --> 00:01:58,680
(Ellie gasps)

60
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,513
- Stop.

61
00:01:59,513 --> 00:02:00,390
- [Jared] Okay, whew.

62
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,663
Will you hit the breaks for us?

63
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,800
Good job.

64
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,450
Oh, it turned green, hit the gas!

65
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:07,685
- Hey!

66
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:12,007
(blows raspberry)

67
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,590
(upbeat music)

68
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,660
- Get this!

69
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,990
We um,

70
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,820
maybe are back in Las Vegas!

71
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,410
- But not in the camper!

72
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:44,760
- [Jared] We're not in the
camper, we're in a hotel

73
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,413
and we've got some fun
stuff for this weekend.

74
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:49,640
- And we literally are on a time crunch.

75
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,460
- Yes, this is a time crunch.

76
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,140
We are gonna go play.
(boys holler)

77
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,622
Hey guys, should we go
look at some sharks?

78
00:02:55,622 --> 00:02:57,202
- Yeah!

79
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,800
Real sharks!

80
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,560
- We are here hanging out
with Jared's college friends,

81
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,250
it's been a 10-year reunion.
- [Jared] Yes!

82
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,800
- So we're gonna get together
with them and hang out,

83
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,250
but first, shark museum.

84
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,150
- Sharks are more important right now

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,480
than reunion time.
- [Ellie] Hold hands.

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,630
- Are we gonna walk?

87
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,630
- Nope
- [Jared] Yep. We're gonna

88
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,250
walk, run, jump, skip
- Oh, I guess we are.

89
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,440
- [Jared] and all of the above.

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,902
And maybe take an Uber.

91
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:18,715
(upbeat music)

92
00:03:18,715 --> 00:03:20,299
- [Ellie] What's your name?

93
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,437
- What's your name?
- Shark!

94
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:22,450
- What?
- Shark.

95
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,520
- Shark? That's your name?
(Ellie giggles)

96
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,127
I don't see any sharks here yet.

97
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:26,960
- [Ellie] What's your name?

98
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,793
- What's your name?

99
00:03:27,793 --> 00:03:28,626
- Cal!

100
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:29,500
- Cal.

101
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,450
There's a wedding place,

102
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,720
so should we go get married over there?

103
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,760
- Jackson.
- No!

104
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,850
- [Ellie] Should we get married?

105
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,683
- No!

106
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:37,027
- [Ellie] Do you think mommy
and daddy are already married?

107
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:37,860
- Yeah.

108
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,243
- [Ellie] We are?
- Yep.

109
00:03:39,243 --> 00:03:40,400
(Ellie laughs)

110
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,275
- [Ellie] Calvin, should
we go get married?

111
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:43,108
- Yes.

112
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:43,941
- Yeah!

113
00:03:43,941 --> 00:03:45,600
- No!

114
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,040
- Are you getting a little nervous?

115
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,440
He says he doesn't wanna
go see a real shark, but,

116
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,100
he always asks if he can watch

117
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,670
real shark videos on YouTube

118
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,340
which I've had to, like,
pre-watch a few of them,

119
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,470
but he always likes sharks, so
you're just a little nervous?

120
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,570
Wanna hold my hand?

121
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,503
- No, I'm gonna run!

122
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,170
- [Ellie] Okay, run.

123
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:14,404
- See the shark!

124
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:16,012
Go see the shark!

125
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,755
- Go see the shark.

126
00:04:17,755 --> 00:04:19,889
- [Jackson] Real shark!

127
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,570
- [Ellie] What did you just ask me?

128
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,460
- How's your belly?

129
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,690
- My belly is good.

130
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,580
He asks that randomly.

131
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,680
He'll be like, "Mom, how are you feeling?"

132
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,220
Sweet thing.

133
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,300
- You can't put your finger
in the shark's mouth.

134
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,179
- [Ellie] Why?

135
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:39,416
- Because he'll bite you and eat you off.

136
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,710
- [Ellie] Oh, I won't put
my hands in the water.

137
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,040
- [Jared] What about our toes?

138
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,650
- No!
- [Ellie] No, no way.

139
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,483
We'll just look.

140
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,082
- [Jared] What about your nose?

141
00:04:48,082 --> 00:04:48,915
- No!

142
00:04:50,506 --> 00:04:52,080
Not my owie!

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,440
- [Jared] He's serious about this.

144
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,650
'Kay, Jackson, do you wanna
give them the tickets?

145
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,530
Can you give them your ticket?

146
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,030
- [Ellie] Come on, mister, no.

147
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:02,488
Stand up. (laughs)

148
00:05:02,488 --> 00:05:05,306
- Ray! I saw the stingray!

149
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:06,139
I saw the stingray!

150
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,053
- [Jared] Look how big that fish is!

151
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,370
- [Jackson] Whoa!

152
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,480
- [Jared and Ellie] Oh my gosh!

153
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,362
- [Jared] Look at that one,

154
00:05:14,362 --> 00:05:16,300
it's got a point on his
head like a unicorn.

155
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,757
It's a unifish!

156
00:05:17,757 --> 00:05:19,536
- [Jackson] Hammerhead shark!

157
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:21,422
- Did he just say that?
(Ellie laughs)

158
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:22,550
That's amazing.
- [Ellie] We've been watching

159
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,785
shark videos. (laughs)

160
00:05:23,785 --> 00:05:25,200
- [Jared] That's amazing.

161
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,658
- Where's the sharks?

162
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:27,491
- [Jared] They're gonna come around

163
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:28,831
the mountain when them come.

164
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:29,940
(Ellie laughs)

165
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,643
- [Ellie] Calvin, what do
you think of the sharks?

166
00:05:32,643 --> 00:05:33,924
- Sharks!

167
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,924
(gasps)

168
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:38,669
- [Jackson] Great White Shark!

169
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:39,657
It's the Great White...
- [Jared] He's learning

170
00:05:39,657 --> 00:05:42,235
all of these names, that's so cool.

171
00:05:42,235 --> 00:05:43,068
- Two!

172
00:05:43,068 --> 00:05:44,208
- [Jared] Two.

173
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,261
There it is again.

174
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:47,930
- [Jackson] Hammerhead Shark!

175
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,470
- [Jared] Kinda looks
like one, doesn't it?

176
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,387
- What the!

177
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:53,546
Shark!

178
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:58,682
- [Ellie] Oh,

179
00:05:59,518 --> 00:06:00,351
Jackson!

180
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,890
- Hey Jackson, these are stingrays, right?

181
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,128
- [Jackson] Yeah.
- Where do we not touch them?

182
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,500
- Not eyes, not tails.

183
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,653
- [Jared] That's right.

184
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,217
- We cannot go in there.

185
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:14,883
Look at that shark, mom!

186
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:18,595
- [Ellie] What did he say?

187
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,933
Calvin, what did you say?

188
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,060
- It's going to eat me.
- Let's go.

189
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,780
- [Jared] It's not gonna eat you, bud.

190
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,613
Say hello!

191
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:28,942
- [Ellie] Calvin!
(Jackson mumbles)

192
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:31,940
- [Jared] Oh, there it
is, there's the shark.

193
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,840
- [Ellie] They've got their GoPros out.

194
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,450
Hey, I found a job for you.

195
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,080
- Yeah, how cool is this?

196
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,350
Scuba diving with the sharks.
- [Jackson] Look at that shark

197
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,700
- [Jared] Whoa!
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness!

198
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,878
He didn't even flinch!

199
00:06:42,878 --> 00:06:44,307
What did you think of that?

200
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:45,741
- [Jared] He's coming
back, he's coming back!

201
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,200
(laughs)

202
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,957
Jackson, he must like you.

203
00:06:50,048 --> 00:06:51,991
- [Ellie] Calvin's outta here!

204
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,330
(laughs)

205
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,850
- He must like him. That was so crazy.

206
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:57,080
- [Ellie] The turtle came out.

207
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,030
Oh my goodness.

208
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,204
Oh my gosh.

209
00:07:01,204 --> 00:07:02,670
(Calvin babbles)

210
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,254
- I think I've got a squeak in my shoe.

211
00:07:04,254 --> 00:07:07,480
(Calvin babbles)

212
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,313
Calvin...

213
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:10,292
- My pants.

214
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,480
- [Ellie] Peeing in your pants?

215
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,113
- Yes.
- [Ellie] Oh.

216
00:07:13,113 --> 00:07:14,824
- [Jared] That was your
favorite part of the day?

217
00:07:14,824 --> 00:07:15,657
- Mm hmm!

218
00:07:15,657 --> 00:07:17,716
- [Jared] Jackson, what was
your favorite part of the day?

219
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:18,549
- Sharks.

220
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:19,860
- [Jared] Seeing the sharks?
- Yeah.

221
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,130
- [Jared] Good, mom,
what was your favorite

222
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,550
part of the day?
- Not peeing my pants!

223
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,960
- [Jared] Good, I'm glad
that that wasn't your

224
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,350
favorite part because it was probably

225
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,483
your least favorite
part when you did that.

226
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:29,705
- I think the airplane ride's always fun.

227
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:30,538
- [Jared] Yeah.

228
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:31,610
- That's always fun.

229
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,210
- The sharks were a lot of fun,

230
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,090
but I don't think my favorite
part has happened yet

231
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,040
and I'll tell you why.

232
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,330
12 and a half years ago,

233
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,290
I met my college friends
for the very first time

234
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,280
and every year at the end of the semester,

235
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,810
which would be in just
a couple weeks for us,

236
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,180
but 12 years ago,

237
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,460
we would go out to dinner

238
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:55,210
because it was right around
all of our birthdays,

239
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,950
we were celebrating the end of semester,

240
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,020
and we needed a break
from studying for finals.

241
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,709
It's been nearly 10 years
since we've done that

242
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:06,400
and since we've gotten
together, all of us,

243
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,970
and we decided that we
should do this again.

244
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,920
We should have a little reunion.

245
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,071
All of us live right around, like,

246
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,180
in a circular pattern around Las Vegas,

247
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,880
so we said let's all meet in the middle,

248
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,280
we'll come to Las Vegas
and we'll get together,

249
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,090
have a reunion for the weekend,

250
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,400
and have dinner just like
we used to in college.

251
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,600
So we're all getting together,

252
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,690
we're all gathering up tonight

253
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:29,860
so tomorrow we can have a wonderful day

254
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:34,440
with my college buddies,
their spouses, and their kids.

255
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,568
This is going to be a great weekend.

256
00:08:36,568 --> 00:08:39,151
(upbeat music)

257
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,470
So my college buddies are here,

258
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,500
we're hanging out.
- [Kyle] Hello!

259
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,230
- We got Nick, Kyle and Jasmine.

260
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,180
We're sitting around the table

261
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,640
just catching up on everything

262
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,300
and I looked at Kyle and was like,

263
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,460
I wanna tell the story
of how we first met.

264
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,220
And I told Ellie and
she's like, "Oh, geez,

265
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,100
this story again."
- Well, no, it's good for

266
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,143
especially kids and teenagers,
- [Jared] Yeah

267
00:09:06,143 --> 00:09:08,140
let's just be friends with people.

268
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,030
- So, you had a roommate
from summer semester

269
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,240
and we're gonna see him
in a little bit, too.

270
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,130
I had a roommate who was
going to summer semester

271
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,120
and they were gone.

272
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,380
So I moved in, I was all by myself.

273
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,970
Kyle moved in and he was all by himself.

274
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,410
We were sitting, we did, like, the tour

275
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,930
and I came up late or I left
early or something like that,

276
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,301
the freshman tour around campus.

277
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,134
- [Nick] Orientation.

278
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,940
- Yeah, orientation, yeah,
I was thinking of the word.

279
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,240
And then we ended up back in our rooms

280
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,650
and I think our doors were open

281
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,440
'cuz we were like, we wanna
meet, you know, some people

282
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,600
and I remember looking at
you sitting you in your room

283
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,040
and thinking, like, this guy thinks

284
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,123
he's the coolest person in the world

285
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,850
because he's from California.

286
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,600
And what did you think of me?

287
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,490
Do you remember?

288
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,620
- I don't.
- [Jared] Okay

289
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,590
- So little recollection.

290
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,510
- Kay, well, you thought, you're like,

291
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,910
this guy left orientation early, he thinks

292
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,680
he's so stinkin' cool.
- Oh, yeah, I thought you were

293
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,370
I thought you thought you were
too cool for the rest of us.

294
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,940
- Yeah, and then, so we're
both looking at each other

295
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,540
thinking, like, this
guy thinks he's so cool,

296
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,520
and then we're just like, so,

297
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,300
do you wanna go get something to eat?

298
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,640
And then instant friends.

299
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,473
- Yes.

300
00:10:13,473 --> 00:10:14,350
- [Jared] Like, that's how it happened.

301
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,150
- And then we went to Cosmo.
- [Jared] Uh huh.

302
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,810
- And then I do remember very,

303
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,150
I think there's maybe the week,

304
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,570
first week of college,
- [Jared] Uh huh.

305
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,850
- You came into my room

306
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,524
and were like, "Hey Kyle, I was just."

307
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,306
- [Jared] Yeah! Yes!

308
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:30,380
- "I was just wondering,
like, if it wouldn't be, like,

309
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,010
too much trouble if I could maybe just."

310
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,660
I'm like, "What is it, Jared?

311
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,830
Like I thought he was gonna ask me, like,

312
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,520
I don't know, for money or
take him across the country.

313
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,410
And he's like, "To borrow your syllabus."

314
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,243
Which is just...

315
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:50,040
- Just, yeah, it's like a
paper that we have in class

316
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,430
and Kyle was like, "Jared,

317
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,070
I'm gonna have you leave the room,

318
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,630
come back and ask again."

319
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,697
(group laughs)

320
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,150
- "This isn't how I function,

321
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,570
that's not how this
relationship's gonna work."

322
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:02,460
So I'm like, "Jared go
out and come back in

323
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,358
and have a little bit more
confidence in yourself."

324
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:07,094
- [Jared] Yeah!
- And Jared's like,

325
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:08,927
"Oh, okay."

326
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,930
- Timid little Jared,

327
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,124
Kyle set ground rules in
our relationship real quick.

328
00:11:13,124 --> 00:11:14,502
- I love it.

329
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:15,749
- Well we did it like three times

330
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:16,582
- [Jared] Yeah.

331
00:11:16,582 --> 00:11:17,657
- Because the second time it was, like,

332
00:11:17,657 --> 00:11:20,730
"Hey Kyle, um, so,

333
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,710
can I maybe possibly, like,

334
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:23,750
can I borrow your syllabus."

335
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,640
And like, again, out the door.

336
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,711
- And finally I was like, "Give
me the freaking syllabus!"

337
00:11:27,711 --> 00:11:29,430
- And that's how we're
gonna work from now on,

338
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,520
we just demand things from each other.

339
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,820
- That is...

340
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,920
I had not heard that part.
- [Jared] Isn't that so funny?

341
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,753
Yeah.
- That's fun.

342
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,530
- I forgot about that until just now.

343
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,350
And then Nick was the floor below us

344
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,907
and we didn't really like him
until the second semester.

345
00:11:40,907 --> 00:11:42,208
(laughs)

346
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,441
- (mumbles) You didn't know me.

347
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:44,862
- [Jared] I'm just kidding.

348
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:45,930
- Get to know me!
- [Jared] Yeah that's right.

349
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,270
- Yeah, so I was one of the few

350
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:49,853
that jumped from the 2200
floor to the 3200 floor

351
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:51,460
to hang out with these guys.
- [Jared] Yeah.

352
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,870
- And it was like a barrier
we just didn't cross,

353
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,580
no one really did, except you.

354
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,810
- I honestly think I
was one of the only ones

355
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:00,081
that was friends with
people on the top floor

356
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,197
versus the middle floor.

357
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:02,030
- [Jared] Yeah.

358
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,910
And here we are 12 years later.

359
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,743
- [Kyle] That's wild.

360
00:12:05,743 --> 00:12:06,984
- Is it 12?
- [Nick] Shoot.

361
00:12:06,984 --> 00:12:08,790
- Yeah, 12.
- [Nick] Yeah, 2006 so...

362
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,657
- 12 years later since we
met, can you believe that?

363
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:13,040
- And I actually live here in Las Vegas.

364
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,488
- [Jared] Yeah, you're the center point.

365
00:12:14,488 --> 00:12:15,321
(laughs)

366
00:12:15,321 --> 00:12:16,154
You're the reason.

367
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:17,070
- Everybody came to me.

368
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,030
- Yep, we're just hanging
out having some dinner

369
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,650
waiting for the rest of
the crew to get here.

370
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,990
Okay, the whole crew is
here, we've got everyone.

371
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,980
So what we decided to do is,

372
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,780
well, we already did this
with the first people here,

373
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,750
but we haven't seen each
other in, like, six years,

374
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,920
so we're gonna go rewind six years

375
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,490
and everyone's gonna give
us a full life update

376
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,323
- [Ellie] Oh my hell.

377
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:38,904
of the past six years,

378
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:39,770
(group clamors)

379
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:42,300
day by day.

380
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,378
(laughs)

381
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:44,373
- It's gonna be a quick update

382
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:46,990
'cuz nobody's done anything! (laughs)

383
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,710
Hearing all of these stories and going

384
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,880
and remembering all of these
things with by buddies,

385
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,889
oh Ellie!

386
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:53,880
(laughs)

387
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,950
Just, it makes, it's fun going back,

388
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,080
whoo, hey,

389
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,850
in time and reliving
all of those experiences

390
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,870
and I can't wait to do it
for the next couple days,

391
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,210
but for now, we have to get some sleep

392
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,637
because we're gonna party tomorrow

393
00:13:06,637 --> 00:13:07,970
- I'm so tired.
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.

394
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:08,897
Yeah, and it's like midnight,

395
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,220
and Ellie and I usually
don't stay up this late

396
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,293
unless, well, together.
- [Ellie] (laughs) Never.

397
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,470
- I usually am working, but anyway,

398
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,423
that's gonna be it from us.
- Bye!

399
00:13:16,423 --> 00:00:00,000
- Have a wonderful night,
we'll see you tomorrow. Bye!
