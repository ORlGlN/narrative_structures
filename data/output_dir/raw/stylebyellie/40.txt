00:00:00,298 --> 00:00:01,131
- [Ellie] I know it's not bleeding a lot,

2
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:02,791
but I feel like that's pretty open.

- [Jared] Yay!

9
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:13,580
- Tail.

10
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:15,429
- [Jared] Is she biting her tail?

11
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:17,746
She's got a little itch
and that's how she itches.

12
00:00:17,746 --> 00:00:18,908
But don't bite her tail.

13
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:20,672
She doesn't want you to bite her tail.

14
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,240
Good morning Sister Sue.

15
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,588
Good morning, good morning Penny.

16
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:26,648
It's so good to see you.

17
00:00:26,648 --> 00:00:27,481
- Hey.

18
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,314
- [Jared] Hey.

19
00:00:28,314 --> 00:00:29,616
Good morning Calvin.

20
00:00:29,616 --> 00:00:33,816
Uh-oh and for the big
jump, three, two, one!

21
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,046
You get both jumps.

22
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,614
- Do you know what Valentine's Day is?

23
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:37,447
- Mmm-hmm.

24
00:00:37,447 --> 00:00:38,499
- What is it?

25
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:39,332
- I don't know.

26
00:00:39,332 --> 00:00:40,165
(Jared laughs)

27
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,547
- Valentine's day, do
you remember last year

28
00:00:41,547 --> 00:00:43,092
we made cards for all of our friends?

29
00:00:43,092 --> 00:00:43,925
- Mmm-hmm.

30
00:00:43,925 --> 00:00:45,143
- We're gonna go pick out cards,

31
00:00:45,143 --> 00:00:47,339
and you're gonna write
your name on it this year,

32
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:48,877
because you can do your letters.

33
00:00:48,877 --> 00:00:50,473
So you'll write your name, Jackson,

34
00:00:50,473 --> 00:00:52,703
we'll put a piece of candy on the cards

35
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:54,582
and we're gonna send it to your friends.

36
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:56,233
And you'll save some for school okay?

37
00:00:56,233 --> 00:00:57,066
- Candy?

38
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:57,899
- Yeah.

39
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,162
- The kids have been doing so amazing

40
00:01:00,162 --> 00:01:01,537
at sleeping in their beds.

41
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:03,098
They've been sleeping through the night

42
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:05,134
and that's always been
a big struggle for us,

43
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:08,187
especially with Calvin, is
sleeping through the night.

44
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:11,690
But I'm happy to say, there
has been such huge improvement.

45
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,269
Jackson does not wake up in the
middle of the night anymore.

46
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:15,102
He doesn't come out.

47
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:16,042
He doesn't come into our bedroom.

48
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:17,145
And neither does Calvin.

49
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:19,142
Calvin woke up once yesterday

50
00:01:19,142 --> 00:01:19,975
and that was it.

51
00:01:19,975 --> 00:01:21,363
He went down back to bed really quick

52
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:22,458
and that was it.

53
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,483
We're getting sleep.

54
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,498
(laughs)

55
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:26,704
- And Jackson, you're just
being a very good listener.

56
00:01:26,704 --> 00:01:27,537
- [Jared] Yes.

57
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:28,951
- Like we just tole him, you
just can't wake up anymore.

58
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:30,054
You gotta stay in bed.

59
00:01:30,054 --> 00:01:31,433
Really that's all we've told him,

60
00:01:31,433 --> 00:01:33,593
you can't get out of bed any more.

61
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:34,426
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

62
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:35,259
- Bribed him with a few treats,

63
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:36,092
(laughs)

64
00:01:36,092 --> 00:01:37,070
a few prizes

65
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,407
and it's worked awesome.
- Waaa, poo poo.

66
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:40,743
- [Jared] Yeah it has worked awesome.

67
00:01:40,743 --> 00:01:41,576
I'm proud of you.
- Poo poo.

68
00:01:41,576 --> 00:01:44,501
- And that's the thing,
I love seeing improvement

69
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:46,634
and growth and development from the kids.

70
00:01:46,634 --> 00:01:48,725
That's the most rewarding
thing to see as a parent,

71
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:49,558
- [Ellie] Totally.

72
00:01:49,558 --> 00:01:51,083
- Is to see change from them

73
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:52,945
and them making the decision,

74
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:54,601
because they could decide not to do it.

75
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,797
They could to that,

76
00:01:55,797 --> 00:01:57,282
but they want us to be happy

77
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:59,255
and they know that they get a little prize

78
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,372
and they know that it's gonna go away.

79
00:02:01,372 --> 00:02:03,085
Those prizes won't stay forever.

80
00:02:03,085 --> 00:02:05,362
But after awhile, it'll become the norm.

81
00:02:05,362 --> 00:02:06,305
And that's what I love

82
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:07,899
is seeing you grow and develop

83
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:11,289
and become a contributing
member of society.

84
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,701
(Jared laughing)

85
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,973
- I want to wear your earrings.

86
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:16,858
- No, it would hurt your little ears.

87
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,976
- [Jared] You don't have
holes in your ears to wear it.

88
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:19,926
- It would hurt.

89
00:02:19,926 --> 00:02:21,445
We're gonna go okay?

90
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:23,746
- Okay, where's your other one, hey.

91
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:25,228
- [Jared] Do you like 'em, are you pretty?

92
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,828
- Do you know that
Grandma gave them to me?

93
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:28,519
- I love my plaid.

94
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:29,971
- [Ellie] Like right this second.

95
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,518
- Four minutes and 48 seconds.

96
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,351
- [Ellie] Ah!

97
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:34,542
- [Jared] So we are in
the Hamilton waiting room.

98
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:37,735
This is where they see
Hamilton tickets for Salt Lake.

99
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,604
- [Ellie] Okay, the one thing, ah!

100
00:02:39,604 --> 00:02:40,437
- I gotta read this.

101
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:41,879
Okay, hello Hamilton fans--
- Okay, you read, I'll vlog.

102
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,718
- Jared and I a long time ago,

103
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,093
when he was going to New York,

104
00:02:45,093 --> 00:02:46,639
he's like you should come with me

105
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,688
and we'll go to the Hamilton.

106
00:02:47,688 --> 00:02:49,772
We had been traveling a lot at the time

107
00:02:49,772 --> 00:02:52,438
and I just needed to
be home with the kids.

108
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,703
And I was like one day if they ever come

109
00:02:54,703 --> 00:02:55,679
to Utah, we'll go.

110
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,240
And Jared did an email sign up

111
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,853
so that they'll tell you when
the tickets are available,

112
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:02,681
so tons of people are waiting right now

113
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,121
to buy Hamilton tickets Salt Lake

114
00:03:04,121 --> 00:03:06,443
and it's for our birthdays in April,

115
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:07,434
that's when they're coming.

116
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,378
So I was like, let's get tickets for us

117
00:03:09,378 --> 00:03:10,815
and we'll go for our birthdays.

118
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,882
I hope we can get 'em.

119
00:03:11,882 --> 00:03:13,181
- What day is gonna be best for us?

120
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:15,610
Should we do the 20th,
between our birthdays?

121
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,443
- [Ellie] I'm looking.

122
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,276
- What days is it even going?

123
00:03:17,276 --> 00:03:21,146
The best availability is April
18th to May 6th, okay so--

124
00:03:21,146 --> 00:03:22,834
- Are you sure you want do do it that

125
00:03:22,834 --> 00:03:24,509
or do you want to do it
on your birthday the 21st?

126
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,066
- It's birthday month Ellie,

127
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:26,970
all month long.
- Okay

128
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,203
- It'll be in between,

129
00:03:28,203 --> 00:03:29,331
so we'll do the 20th,

130
00:03:29,331 --> 00:03:31,480
maybe we'll stay the night in a hotel.

131
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,838
and then go shopping

132
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:34,222
or play on your birthday.
- That would be magic.

133
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:35,055
- [Ellie] Would that be fun?

134
00:03:35,055 --> 00:03:35,888

135
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:36,721

00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:55,062
- You stepped my hand.

181
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:55,895
- [Ellie] Well I stepped on your hand,

182
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,403
because you're laying on the ground.

183
00:04:57,403 --> 00:04:59,930
Come on, good job, push it in there.

184
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,501
Calvin's not having a good time.

185
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,334
Push it in.

186
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:03,167
(Calvin crying)

187
00:05:03,167 --> 00:05:04,729
Good job, do you want to pull the strap?

188
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:06,112
Okay pull 'em.

189
00:05:06,112 --> 00:05:07,327
What one do you want?

190
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,784
What one should you do, Peppa or PJ Masks?

191
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:10,617
- Peppa.

192
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:12,468
- Okay, let's put Peppa in the cart.

193
00:05:12,468 --> 00:05:15,145
Alright, after a war,
I will hold your rock,

194
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:15,978
(laughs)

195
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:17,909
you found in the road.

196
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:18,744
- All gone.

197
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:19,747
- Is it all gone?

198
00:05:19,747 --> 00:05:22,356
After a little experience,

199
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:25,018
Calvin was very mad at his shoe being off

200
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:26,550
and wouldn't let me help him.

201
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,499
It is on and we are happy now.
- I found these.

202
00:05:28,499 --> 00:05:30,658
- Look, they have these.

203
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:32,286
- Wow, Peppa stickers?

204
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:36,573
I love to share happy
positive fun moments,

205
00:05:36,573 --> 00:05:38,578
and I just want to share with you

206
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:41,020
that the little rug rat is asleep.

207
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,277
(laughs)

208
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:44,279
Okay, went to the grocery store,

209
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:46,353
Calvin was very upset

210
00:05:46,353 --> 00:05:48,433
that his shoe was off, he
didn't want me to help him,

211
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:50,187
he kind of threw himself to the ground.

212
00:05:50,187 --> 00:05:51,463
Then we went to another aisle.

213
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:52,848
I don't even know how it happened

214
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,387
but the cleaner, the bottle broke

215
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,421
and cleaner got everywhere.

216
00:05:56,421 --> 00:05:58,415
It was like a plastic bottle too.

217
00:05:58,415 --> 00:06:00,961
The check out line was crazy.

218
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,877
My card is not working.

219
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:04,854
We have to go to the bank.

220
00:06:04,854 --> 00:06:06,666
We need to figure out a pin.

221
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,685
I got a new card.

222
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:11,248
It's been an issue, and it works sometimes

223
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,046
and sometimes it doesn't.

224
00:06:13,046 --> 00:06:14,451
And then I had left my other card

225
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:15,917
at a restaurant a week ago,

226
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:16,860
which I need to go pick up,

227
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,586
but it's an hour and a half a way.

228
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:21,806
The grocery store trip was not peaceful

229
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,196
and heaven, like a lot of times it is.

230
00:06:24,196 --> 00:06:25,967
I love grocery shopping with my kids,

231
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:28,175
because I think it's fun
that they stay right by me

232
00:06:28,175 --> 00:06:30,584
and it usually is really fun.

233
00:06:30,584 --> 00:06:31,973
Today was not the case.

234
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:34,806
So I'm in the driveway waiting for Jared,

235
00:06:34,806 --> 00:06:35,639
because he's gonna come out,

236
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,855
we're gonna run to the bank,

237
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:37,694
figure out card stuff,

238
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:39,407
go back, get all of our groceries,

239
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:42,074
pay for them, that's the status.

240
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:45,334
Calvin is asleep.

241
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:49,001
Mr. Jackson, I am
unbelievably proud of you.

242
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,328
You were a very well-behaved
boy today, thank you.

243
00:06:53,328 --> 00:06:54,161
- Thank you.

244
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,138
- You're very welcome.

245
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:55,971
You're a good boy.

246
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:57,131
Let's get on with our day,

247
00:06:57,131 --> 00:06:58,986
so we can make Valentine's Day cards.

248
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,088
- So one of the issues
with the cards declining

249
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,215
is actually a captioning
service that we use.

250
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,562
If you guys didn't know, every single one

251
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:08,650
of our videos, at least
for the past two years

252
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,386
I think, has captions.

253
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:13,482
And that captions allows
people who are hard of hearing

254
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,920
to know what's going on
and know what we're saying

255
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,810
in the vlog.

256
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,630
It also allows easier
translations on videos,

257
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,533
so people of different languages

258
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,872
can watch our videos.

259
00:07:22,872 --> 00:07:26,128
That's a price that we
pay every single day.

260
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:30,100
And for some reason, our bank flagged it

261
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,347
and was like sorry, we're not
letting you do that anymore.

262
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:34,589
And we were like oh man.

263
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:35,597
And that was the block

264
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:38,053
that caused all of the other issues

265
00:07:38,053 --> 00:07:39,150
that are going on right now.

266
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,896
So I just called and got that
lifted, but Ellie's card--

267
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,758
- [Ellie] So we can do Rev.

268
00:07:43,758 --> 00:07:45,129
- Yeah, so we can still do that.

269
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,914
Ellie's card is under a different name,

270
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,997
your name at that matter,

271
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,240
- [Ellie] I hope so.

272
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,911
- and they wouldn't let me fix your card,

273
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:56,725
so we have to go in and take care of that.

274
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,006
Happy Friday!

275
00:07:58,006 --> 00:07:59,183
- Yay!

276
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:01,432
We're doing Monday
things on Friday, right?

277
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:02,265
- Dangit.

278
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:03,098
It's okay, we're gonna make

279
00:08:03,098 --> 00:08:04,099
Valentine's Day cards, huh Jackson?

280
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:04,932
- Yep.

281
00:08:04,932 --> 00:08:05,765
- Yep.

282
00:08:05,765 --> 00:08:06,825
Alright, so here's the situation.

283
00:08:06,825 --> 00:08:09,927
I put my Jack from This is Us pants on

284
00:08:09,927 --> 00:08:11,641
and I saved the day.

285
00:08:11,641 --> 00:08:13,516
I've got the groceries right here

286
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:16,371
from the store and I
fixed all of our cards

287
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,436
so they will not be declining anymore.

288
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:20,609
When they put those
blocks on, super annoying,

289
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:21,707
but we got the groceries,

290
00:08:21,707 --> 00:08:23,357
the day can now officially start.

291
00:08:23,357 --> 00:08:25,067
Everything that you saw beforehand,

292
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:26,450
the day had not started yet,

293
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,453
mmm-mmm, didn't start.

294
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,273
Now, it's officially started.

295
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:31,588
- [Ellie] These flowers
have been in the water

296
00:08:31,588 --> 00:08:34,505
for two weeks and they have lasted,

297
00:08:35,455 --> 00:08:36,511
look at that.

298
00:08:36,511 --> 00:08:38,008
They look brand new,

299
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:40,044
for two weeks they have stayed alive

300
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:41,208
and I love them.

301
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,387
- [Jackson] Let me do.

302
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,798
- [Ellie] Okay good job.

303
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:46,282
Now trace these bottom one's okay?

304
00:08:46,282 --> 00:08:49,528
Jackson is wrapping up his cards.

305
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:52,572
He definitely would rather trace over mine

306
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,534
than do his own.

307
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,260
We're working on that, huh?

308
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,155
You're doing so good

309
00:08:57,155 --> 00:08:59,064
and are you gonna pass
these out at school?

310
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:00,090
- Mmm-hmm.

311
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,448
This is hard work.

312
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:03,020
- [Ellie] You're doing so good.

313
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,336
I love it.

314
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,869
He really wants one.

315
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:08,024
Do you want to do one sticky for yourself?

316
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:10,598
Use on windows or mirrors.

317
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:12,199
Do you want to go put it on our window?

318
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,910
Or you could put it on here.

319
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,230
- No, I want to do it on the wall.

320
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,368
- [Ellie] Okay go put it on a wall.

321
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:20,451
- The window.

322
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,867
- [Ellie] Perfect.

323
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,067
- I'm behind a bit.

324
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:28,570
But this is super duper hard.

325
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,820
Not two greens.

326
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:33,176
- [Jared] I got it, yeah.

327
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:35,347
Ready?

328
00:09:37,652 --> 00:09:38,485
Boom!

329
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:42,875
Ready ready ready ready ready ready?

330
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:43,881
Go!

331
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:44,714
Boom!

332
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,385
That was a bad kick.

333
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:49,385
(yelling)

334
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:52,247
(yelling)

335
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,497
(laughing)

336
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,559
- Do you know how Mommy
and Daddy go on dates?

337
00:09:57,559 --> 00:09:58,392
- Mmm-hmm.

338
00:09:58,392 --> 00:10:00,654
- Well you are going on
a special date with us.

339
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:01,487
Are you ready?

340
00:10:01,487 --> 00:10:02,320
- Yeah.

341
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,153
- Are you excited?

342
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:03,986
- Popcorn!

343
00:10:03,986 --> 00:10:04,876
- What are we gonna see?

344
00:10:04,876 --> 00:10:06,427
- The dream movie.

345
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:07,608

00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:08,875
- Calvin, what happened?

362
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:10,708
- I bonked my head.

363
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:11,907
- [Jared] You bonked your head?

364
00:11:11,907 --> 00:11:13,814
- You bonked your head right there.

365
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,676
Oh my baby boy.

366
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,466
Look at that cut.

367
00:11:17,466 --> 00:11:18,650
I think you're gonna be okay,

368
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,058
I don't think it needs stitches.

369
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:21,456
- [Jared] Yeah, I don't think it does.

370
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:24,072
- But we're gonna ask
Uncle Joel and Aunt Bonnie.

371
00:11:24,072 --> 00:11:24,905
Okay?

372
00:11:24,905 --> 00:11:26,319
- What about Dad?

373
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:27,152
(laughs)

374
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,073
- Well just a second opinion.

375
00:11:29,073 --> 00:11:29,906
- I'm kidding.

376
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:31,957
- Calvin are you okay?

377
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:32,790
- Mmm-hmm.

378
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,796
- Are you saying that they're
expert at stitches by now?

379
00:11:34,796 --> 00:11:37,826
- Well yeah, they have
had more damages doot.

380
00:11:37,826 --> 00:11:38,801
- I'm just kidding.

381
00:11:38,801 --> 00:11:41,576
- [Ellie] Cal, Calvin, what happened?

382
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,364
- I bonked my head.

383
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:44,511
- [Ellie] You bonked your head?

384
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,344
- He's showing.

385
00:11:45,344 --> 00:11:47,289
- Gosh dangit, it's
like your kids get hurt

386
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,705
when they're not with you, I swear.

387
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,850
But he'll be okay, you tough little boy,

388
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,760
you got blood on your pants.
- He is tough.

389
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,593
- Oh no.

390
00:11:53,593 --> 00:11:54,426
- [Ellie] Dangit.

391
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:56,536
Well the thing is, is it looks deep.

392
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:58,703
I don't know, that's deep.

393
00:12:00,146 --> 00:12:01,202
I know it's not bleeding a lot,

394
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:02,848
but I feel like that's pretty open.

395
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:04,731
We'll see, you're a tough boy, huh?

396
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:05,789
He bonked his head.

397
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:08,445
- He bonked his head?
- Ooh.

398
00:12:08,445 --> 00:12:09,525
- [Jared] Now he's showing ya.

399
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:10,908
- [Ellie] But look at
it, I mean I don't think

400
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:12,400
it needs stitches, but--

401
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,351
You don't think so.

402
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:14,184
Owie Cal.

403
00:12:19,565 --> 00:12:20,771
Woo.

404
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:21,936
- Does that tickle?

405
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,114
- He smiling.

406
00:12:23,114 --> 00:12:24,707
- Does that tickle?

407
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:25,790
Good job bud.

408
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:28,260
- [Calvin] All done?

409
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,414
- Not all done.
- Just hold it right there.

410
00:12:29,414 --> 00:12:30,247
- Just hold it there.

411
00:12:30,247 --> 00:12:31,080
- Can you fold your arms?

412
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,620
- How many fingers am I holding up?

413
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,453
- Two.

414
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,286
- Good job.

415
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,571
You know, it's kinda been a rough day.

416
00:12:36,571 --> 00:12:38,000
We've had a little bit of a rough day.

417
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,891
And that's okay,

418
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,831
But just to recap, Ellie had a hard time

419
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,007
at the grocery store.

420
00:12:42,007 --> 00:12:44,582
Calvin had a hard time
at the grocery store.

421
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:46,514
I guess Calvin's had a rough day.

422
00:12:46,514 --> 00:12:47,947
- Calvin poor thing.

423
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:48,944
- Calvin bonked his head.

424
00:12:48,944 --> 00:12:51,271
But guess what, I'm about
to drop another bomb.

425
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,104
- [Ellie] What?

426
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:52,937
- Some bad news.

427
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:53,770
- [Ellie] Oh yeah.

428
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:55,764
- Hamilton is sold out.

429
00:12:55,764 --> 00:12:56,967
We didn't get tickets.

430
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,339
We were in line for hours,

431
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:00,104
online, so we weren't really in line,

432
00:13:00,104 --> 00:13:01,441
but we were in virtual line.

433
00:13:01,441 --> 00:13:02,653
- Dangit.

434
00:13:02,653 --> 00:13:04,771
- We can't go see Hamilton in Salt Lake,

435
00:13:04,771 --> 00:13:07,032
but all in all, just
because days are rough

436
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,545
doesn't mean the next day
isn't going to be great.

437
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,850
Ellie and I are gonna call it a night.

438
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,197
And we want to thank you for watching.

439
00:13:13,197 --> 00:13:14,564
Calvin is doing great.

440
00:13:14,564 --> 00:13:15,870
He's very very happy.

441
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,250
But that is where we're
going to end this vlog,

442
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,711
so thank you guys so much for watching.

443
00:13:18,711 --> 00:13:21,646
If you enjoyed it, ugh,
that sounds kind of weird,

444
00:13:21,646 --> 00:13:23,576
if you enjoyed our terrible day,

445
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:24,409
(laughs)

446
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:25,732
give the video a big thumbs up

447
00:13:25,732 --> 00:00:00,000
and we will see you guys tomorrow, bye.
