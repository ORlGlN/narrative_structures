(cheery music)

2
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:12,067
- Oh,

3
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:13,469
my,

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:14,302
goodness!

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:16,631
My office!

6
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:19,786
Calvin, my office.

7
00:00:19,786 --> 00:00:20,839
(laughs)

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,713
Do you guys remember that toy

9
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:25,593
that Penny was chewing on?

10
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:29,260
Well, I'm sad to say
he's no longer with us.

11
00:00:30,589 --> 00:00:34,567
We cannot get toys with cotton inside them

12
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,051
because, oh my goodness,
would you look at that.

13
00:00:37,051 --> 00:00:38,230
Is this crazy, Calvin?

14
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,230
Yeah, it's pretty crazy.

15
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,439
I'll be right back, I've
gotta clean that up.

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,417
That's a lot.

17
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,852
Poor little guy, didn't even
stand a chance against Penny.

18
00:00:46,852 --> 00:00:48,073
She's got some chompers.

19
00:00:48,073 --> 00:00:49,698
She's got some chompers.

20
00:00:49,698 --> 00:00:50,674
I'm going to clean this up

21
00:00:50,674 --> 00:00:52,792
and we're going to take
Penny on a nice long walk.

- My goodness gracious, boys,

27
00:01:15,152 --> 00:01:17,353
it's kind of a gloomy day today isn't it?

28
00:01:17,353 --> 00:01:18,186
- Yeah.

29
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:19,879
- Lots of cloud coverage.

30
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,277
I feel like we might get
snow here pretty soon,

31
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:23,540
in the next week or so.

32
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,015
Do you guys like snow?

33
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:25,848
- Yeah.

34
00:01:25,848 --> 00:01:27,089
- What do you like to do in the snow?

35
00:01:27,089 --> 00:01:27,922
- Ski.

36
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,366
- Ski (gasps)

37
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:30,506
Should we go skiing this year?

38
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,256
That would be so much fun.

39
00:01:32,256 --> 00:01:35,646
- But there's not enough
snow on the mountain.

40
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,071
- Not yet, we gotta get more snow,

41
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:38,827
but it think it's, I feel
likes it's gonna snow

42
00:01:38,827 --> 00:01:42,006
this week, sometime, I
haven't looked at the weather,

43
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:43,510
but I would love for it to do that

44
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,377
right around Thanksgiving time.

45
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:46,396
That would be a lot of fun.

46
00:01:46,396 --> 00:01:49,486
So, Ellie is out, she is
in a meeting right now,

47
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:51,847
and so the boys and I
are having a little trip.

48
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:54,418
Penny, you're an honorary boy today.

49
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,498
We're taking Penny for a walk

50
00:01:56,498 --> 00:01:58,655
and we're just gettin'
some fresh air outside,

51
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,081
and we're gonna have a little fun.

52
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,667
Father and sons outing.

53
00:02:01,667 --> 00:02:04,155
(cheerful music)

54
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:05,538
- [Jared] Got one?

55
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:06,371
- Yeah.

56
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,494
(guitar music)

57
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:17,893
- We better go to our house to warm,

58
00:02:17,893 --> 00:02:19,702
to warm me up.

59
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:20,884
- Are you getting cold?

60
00:02:20,884 --> 00:02:21,717
- Yeah.

61
00:02:21,717 --> 00:02:22,634
- Okay.

62
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:23,570
- Really cold.

63
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,554
- Really cold?

64
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:25,387
- Yeah.

65
00:02:25,387 --> 00:02:26,916
- Alright, so we'll start heading back.

66
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,665
- Calvin wants to be just like Penny,

67
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:29,922
running through the weeds.

68
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,306
Look at him go.

69
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,136
- I just got home from the morning

70
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:35,193
and I got home and no one was here.

71
00:02:35,193 --> 00:02:38,600
Jared, you took the boys
and Penny on a walk.

72
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,624
- We've been busy this morning.

73
00:02:39,624 --> 00:02:40,684
- Were the boys in the stroller?

74
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:41,827
- No
- or walk

75
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:42,845
- They were just exploring,

76
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:44,228
Calvin is just like Penny, he's like,

77
00:02:44,228 --> 00:02:45,331
I'm running through these fields

78
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,430
and I don't care who sees me.

79
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,263
(Ellie laughs)

80
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:48,706
So he's like.

81
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:50,296
- Jared just said, he's like,

82
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,084
oh I got the boys in the car,
I'm gonna take 'em to lunch.

83
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:53,059
I was like,

84
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,029
can I come?

85
00:02:54,029 --> 00:02:56,021
So, I just got home and
I'm gonna go to lunch.

86
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:56,854
- Yeah.

87
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,156
- This is a nice surprise.

88
00:02:58,156 --> 00:02:59,133
- This is fun.

89
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,405
- Do you guys remember
the other day, I was,

90
00:03:01,405 --> 00:03:03,076
I vlogged a little bit
of me, like, picking up.

91
00:03:03,076 --> 00:03:06,534
I am one to really
like, I like my routine,

92
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,892
I really like picking up, but lately,

93
00:03:08,892 --> 00:03:11,004
I just haven't had it in me, and like,

94
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:13,282
it's not even bad, it's not even bad.

95
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:16,130
It's just life, but
it's not my normal life.

96
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:18,245
So, it's just weird to see like
there's laundry everywhere,

97
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,473
there's dishes everywhere.

98
00:03:19,473 --> 00:03:20,779
- Wo, wo wo wo

99
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:21,756
- My bed isn't made

100
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:23,543
- Wo, there's dishes everywhere?

101
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:24,725
- You did them today.

102
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:26,066
- When you walked in here,

103
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:28,055
it was messy this morning,

104
00:03:28,055 --> 00:03:28,888
- You did them.

105
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:30,172
- It was really messy this morning.

106
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:32,123
And I think you did
all of this right here.

107
00:03:32,123 --> 00:03:32,956
- I did, I did.

108
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:35,414
- All of this was a disaster.

109
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:36,470
- And you picked it up.

110
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,178
I'm not trying to say right now.

111
00:03:38,178 --> 00:03:39,034
- I'm just sayin'

112
00:03:39,034 --> 00:03:39,867
- Okay, let's go.

113
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,188
- Give credit where credit is due!

114
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:42,449
- Jared's gonna take us to lunch,

115
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:44,239
but what I thought was cute.

116
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,866
I know I'm all over the place.

117
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:46,967
(Jared laughs)

118
00:03:46,967 --> 00:03:48,556
- I just wanted to show
you guys a little bit

119
00:03:48,556 --> 00:03:51,045
that I don't always clean
and I'm not always together,

120
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,224
I just wanted to show you that,

121
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,902
but now I'm flustered, nevermind, lets go.

122
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,411
- [Ellie] Hey Jackson,

123
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:58,729
Daddy said you got
dressed all by yourself.

124
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:01,388
- [Jared] Did you pick
out your outfit today?

125
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,773
And you dressed yourself?

126
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:04,153
- [Ellie] You look good.

127
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,963
Calvin, look at him snoring
away, oh my goodness.

128
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:08,693
- [Jared] It's that time of day.

129
00:04:08,693 --> 00:04:10,468
- [Ellie] You look so cute, Jacks.

130
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:11,767
Good job dressing yourself.

131
00:04:11,767 --> 00:04:12,767
- Thank you.

132
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,433
(lunch crowd chatter)

133
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,751
- [Ellie] Hey, are you
trying to wake him up?

134
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:27,751
You probably should eat.

135
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:31,327
It's okay, it's okay though.

136
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,684
Um, this says "look out the window"

137
00:04:36,684 --> 00:04:38,767
(laughs)

138
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,000
(bopping music)

139
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,735
- So the last few days
have been Jared and I

140
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:48,928
doing lots of filming and we decided

141
00:04:48,928 --> 00:04:50,918
lets take the kids out,
lets take them for a date,

142
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:52,828
spend some really good time with them,

143
00:04:52,828 --> 00:04:54,698
and we are at The Jump Zone.

144
00:04:54,698 --> 00:04:56,573
And we got new socks, ugh,

145
00:04:56,573 --> 00:04:59,016
those stinkers, they got new socks

146
00:04:59,016 --> 00:05:00,679
for this place, that you have to wear,

147
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,742
so instead of wearing your own socks

148
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:06,236
that are slippery and fun, now it's safe.

149
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,335
- (laughs) Darn it!

150
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:08,601
Now it's safe.

151
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,519
- Safe but still fun.

152
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,102
(upbeat music)

153
00:05:14,468 --> 00:05:17,468
(clapping to music)

154
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:23,653
(Ellie laughing)

155
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,869
(Ellie laughing)

156
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,560
- It is so cold in here 'cause
it's really cold outside.

157
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,727
I'm so glad that they turned
the fire on, makes it so warm.

158
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:42,832
- [Ellie] Whoa!

159
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,773
(upbeat music)

160
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:53,954
- [Ellie] Wo, ho ho!

161
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:57,921
Whoa.

162
00:05:59,286 --> 00:06:00,291
Land!

163
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,634
Woo hoo hoo.

164
00:06:01,634 --> 00:06:03,346
Was that better?

165
00:06:03,346 --> 00:06:05,458
I pushed and so he'd go a little further.

166
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,471
Can I push you again?

167
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,304
- Yeah.

168
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:08,590
- K, hold on tight, tight.

169
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,423
Ready?

170
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:10,987
Go.

171
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:11,820
Let go!

172
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,305
Good job.

173
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:14,531
It's kind of scary.

174
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:16,755
They just opened. (laughs)

175
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:17,588
- What?

176
00:06:17,588 --> 00:06:18,421
- They just opened for the day.

177
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:20,394
We're like the only ones here.

178
00:06:20,394 --> 00:06:21,227
Awesome.

179
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:24,719
(Ellie laughing)

180
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:27,643
Every time he climbs up, he slides down.

181
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:30,384
(Jared and Ellie laughing)

182
00:06:30,384 --> 00:06:32,988
- [Ellie] He's getting mad.

183
00:06:32,988 --> 00:06:35,571
(upbeat music)

184
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:42,558
(upbeat music)

185
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:54,252
(rhythmic hand drums and clapping)

186
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:01,587
(Ellie laughing)

187
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:04,855
- [Jared] Woooooo!

188
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:11,854
(upbeat music)

189
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,746
- [Ellie] He keeps shaking his butt.

190
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:25,880
(Ellie laughing)

191
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,297
Did you see that?

192
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:31,599
(Ellie laughing)

193
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,932
- [Ellie] Do you dance, Cal?

194
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:39,582
(laughing)

195
00:07:41,747 --> 00:07:42,580
- [Jared] Boo.

196
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,413
- Ahh!

197
00:07:43,413 --> 00:07:46,163
(Jared laughing)

198
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:47,904
- Hi buddy.

199
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:48,983
- Hi.

200
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,619
- Oh my goodness.

201
00:07:50,619 --> 00:07:53,551
- Jackson, I think we had
a pretty great day today.

202
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,384
- Yeah.

203
00:07:54,384 --> 00:07:55,827
- Did you have fun?

204
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:59,018
What was your favorite part about the day?

205
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:01,935
- Uh, going to the trampoline zone.

206
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:05,477
- The trampoline zone, that was fun huh?

207
00:08:05,477 --> 00:08:06,310
- Yeah.

208
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,392
- You did a sweet front flip.

209
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,225
- Yeah.

210
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:09,353
- Yeah, you're pretty brave you know that?

211
00:08:09,353 --> 00:08:10,186
- Mm hmm.

212
00:08:10,186 --> 00:08:11,797
- K, can you say goodnight to our friends?

213
00:08:11,797 --> 00:08:13,290
- Goodnight, poo poo.

214
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,381
- Hey!

215
00:08:14,381 --> 00:08:16,020
Call them our friends.

216
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,857
- Bye, friends.

217
00:08:17,857 --> 00:08:18,916
I need to go to sleep

218
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:22,048
because I need to go to school tomorrow.

219
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,515
- Oh, okay, goodnight.

220
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,079
- K, goodnight.

221
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,662
(Jared snorts)

222
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:31,812
[Ellie Laughing]

223
00:08:31,812 --> 00:08:35,190
- [Ellie] I would have
been so mad if that hit me.

224
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,653
Ow, that doesn't hurt.

225
00:08:36,653 --> 00:08:39,474
I thought that was going to hurt.

226
00:08:39,474 --> 00:08:42,760
Woo, you got my, ooh, you got it.

227
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,876
Woo, you got my forehead.

228
00:08:43,876 --> 00:08:45,456
(laughing)

229
00:08:45,456 --> 00:08:46,289
- It's okay

230
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:47,289
- It's okay.

231
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,503
I guess...

232
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:52,455
I guess that's a wrap.

233
00:08:52,455 --> 00:08:55,718
The kids had a blast at the jump zone,

234
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:58,112
I loved watching them,
I loved watching you.

235
00:08:58,112 --> 00:09:00,472
- We had fun, I had fun
today with the kids,

236
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:03,116
like, we really had some
good father son bonding time,

237
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:04,951
and it was just so fun to be with them,

238
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,889
and I loved it.

239
00:09:05,889 --> 00:09:09,064
- Jared showed me the
clip of Jackson and Calvin

240
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:10,996
walking together and he's like,

241
00:09:10,996 --> 00:09:12,261
do you know what they're talking about?

242
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,135
I was like, no, and he goes,

243
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,851
they're talking about poop.

244
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,330
Tell them what Jackson said.

245
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,621
- It was Calvin, the one that
Calvin was talking about,

246
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:23,458
pooping in the toilet, and
Jackson was asking him,

247
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,814
he's like, not in a diaper?

248
00:09:25,814 --> 00:09:27,972
And Calvin said, no, toilet.

249
00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:29,966
It was the cutest thing, like,

250
00:09:29,966 --> 00:09:32,571
and they had this conversation
for like 30 seconds

251
00:09:32,571 --> 00:09:35,094
before they came around that corner.

252
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,478
It was so cute and funny.

253
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:37,656
If you guys didn't already know,

254
00:09:37,656 --> 00:09:39,898
poop is a pretty discussed
topic in our family.

255
00:09:39,898 --> 00:09:41,654
- I mean, it's always been a topic,

256
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:43,532
and then we had kids.

257
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:44,472
- And so it's twice as much.

258
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:45,448
- And then it exploded,

259
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,364
and now we talk about it all the time.

260
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:50,945
- It's like, it's just explosive diarrhea.

261
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:52,018
- We talk about it all the time.

262
00:09:52,018 --> 00:09:53,039
- I'll see myself out.

263
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,985
- And that's, our household is very open,

264
00:09:56,985 --> 00:09:58,450
about anything and everything;

265
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,700
freckles, um...

266
00:10:01,259 --> 00:10:03,190
Did you guys watch that video

267
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:07,826
when we were in China, the
things that Jackson said.

268
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:10,143
I haven't looked back at that video.

269
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:11,483
That went up right?

270
00:10:11,483 --> 00:10:12,316
- Yeah.

271
00:10:12,316 --> 00:10:13,316
His funny sayings?

272
00:10:13,316 --> 00:10:14,149
- Yeah.

273
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,601
Anyway, anyway, anyway, I won't ramble.

274
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:18,473
Thank you guys so much for watching.

275
00:10:18,473 --> 00:10:19,902
We'll see you tomorrow.

276
00:10:19,902 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye!
