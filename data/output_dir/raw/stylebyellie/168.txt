1
00:00:00,205 --> 00:00:02,788
(bright music)

2
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:27,655
- Hi, you brought me the camera?

3
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:29,349
- [Jackson] No I'm filming you.

4
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,001
- Oh you're filming me?

5
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:32,918
- [Jackson] Yeah, okay.

6
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,768
- Okay come closer to me,

7
00:00:38,768 --> 00:00:40,654
okay, lift it up, so you can see my face.

8
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:41,487
Good job.

9
00:00:42,414 --> 00:00:44,683
I asked Jackson to go
grab the camera for me,

10
00:00:44,683 --> 00:00:45,986
and he said he wants to be my camera man,

11
00:00:45,986 --> 00:00:47,705
so I'm gonna let you.

12
00:00:47,705 --> 00:00:48,983
I wanted to give you guys a

13
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,559
Okay, you can't push the record button,

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,344
leave it recording.

15
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,608
I wanted to give you an update on my hair,

16
00:00:54,608 --> 00:00:58,335
since I recently cut it
and I recently colored it.

17
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:01,085
And I told the lady that I wanted

18
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,846
it to be pretty blonde.

19
00:01:03,846 --> 00:01:06,511
So I had told my color friend

20
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:09,545
that I wanted my hair to be really blonde,

21
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:11,232
so she did a really

22
00:01:11,232 --> 00:01:12,717
That wasn't working out very well,

23
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:14,884
but I told my hair stylist

24
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:18,581
that I wanted my hair to not be so gold,

25
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:22,670
so she toned it, and it
looked kind of almost gray

26
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:23,533
and I loved it.

27
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:26,218
It was like this white, platinum color

28
00:01:26,218 --> 00:01:28,001
but it doesn't stay very long,

29
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:30,478
and so I've been using purple
shampoo and conditioner

30
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,068
to help keep it not go so gold.

31
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:34,198
And I really like it right now,

32
00:01:34,198 --> 00:01:36,467
but I've had a lot of people ask

33
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:37,391
how I've been curling it

34
00:01:37,391 --> 00:01:39,125
with it being short lately,

35
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,469
and if I liked the
curling iron that I used

36
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,494
at Bonnie's house.

37
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:44,658
It was called The Beachwaver.

38
00:01:44,658 --> 00:01:46,336
And I'm gonna be really honest,

39
00:01:46,336 --> 00:01:48,952
I haven't used Bonnie's
curling iron long enough

40
00:01:48,952 --> 00:01:51,695
to know if I really like it a whole ton

41
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,562
to give like a good review,

42
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:55,977
but I still like how I do it

43
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,459
a little bit better,

44
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,205
because I feel like The Beachwaver,

45
00:01:59,205 --> 00:02:01,829
especially if you're not
used to curling your hair,

46
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:04,654
you could damage it, because you insert it

47
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:06,246
and then you push the button to roll it.

48
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:07,999
And it's just kind of different.

49
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:09,139
But it's a beautiful curl.

50
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:11,785
But what I did today is
I just blow dried it,

51
00:02:11,785 --> 00:02:14,884
and then I took the ends of
my hair with the flat iron,

52
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:18,064
and just went through
just my ends a little bit,

53
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:19,890
and then I have my curling wand.

54
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,613
This is the NuMe curling wand,

55
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:23,655
but there's also one on Amazon

56
00:02:23,655 --> 00:02:26,954
that's Bedhead curling wand
that was like $30 dollars,

57
00:02:26,954 --> 00:02:28,174
at least it was two years ago,

58
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:30,511
that I got, that I really liked too.

59
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:32,559
So I just have my curling wand

60
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:34,503
and I just warp it around

61
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:37,836
and I leave the bottom like an inch out,

62
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,554
so I don't curl it.

63
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:44,323
And then I let go, and
that's the curl I get.

64
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:46,394
And that's what I've
been doing with my hair,

65
00:02:46,394 --> 00:02:48,520
so I wanted to give you
guys a little update.

66
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,473
- So I wanted to give you
a little update on my hair.

67
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:54,336
It's still going gray, crazy I know.

68
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,945
But I really am enjoying this hair cut

69
00:02:56,945 --> 00:02:58,041
that Ellie gave me.

70
00:02:58,041 --> 00:02:59,427
The part's really nice.

71
00:02:59,427 --> 00:03:02,179
And my hair just feels
really healthy and strong.

72
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,739
So I just feel like this is a really

73
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,884
really nice thing that I
have going for me right now.

74
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:08,153
I'm gonna just try and keep it going

75
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,473
the way that I have been.

76
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:10,808
So I don't know, what do you think,

77
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:11,849
do I look pretty good?

78
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,474
Maybe throw a little product in there?

79
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:14,327
I think I will.

80
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:16,998
(laughing)

81
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:17,831
(crickets)

82
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,664
(laughing)

83
00:03:18,664 --> 00:03:19,893
- What is this for?

84
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:21,270
- That's why I think banana creme

85
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,948
on a chocolate donut
would just be the best

86
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:25,020
kind of creme you could get.

87
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,853
Don't you think?

88
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:27,278
- I concur.

89
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:28,194
I'm glad we settled this.

90
00:03:28,194 --> 00:03:29,809
- Raspberry creme is pretty good too.

91
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,047
- But only on
- We've been over this.

92
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:32,263
- Powdered donuts,

93
00:03:32,263 --> 00:03:34,964
We've been over it a
hundred times already.

94
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,727
Okay, that's what this
whole meeting is about.

95
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:39,139
She just doesn't listen to me in meetings.

96
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:40,416
Bonnie will you go over
the notes real quick,

97
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,433
and tell me when Ellie
was actually listening?

98
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:44,647
- Well first of all, I just need to say,

99
00:03:44,647 --> 00:03:46,030
all this donut talk is really rude,

100
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,034
because I'm trying not to eat donuts!

101
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:49,414
(Jared laughs)

102
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:51,189
- I ate the two that
you left on the counter

103
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,753
the other night, oh my god yeah.

104
00:03:53,753 --> 00:03:56,564
- It was hard for me to refuse it.

105
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:57,603
- We are just hanging out here.

106
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:58,695
We had a meeting.

107
00:03:58,695 --> 00:04:00,615
We had a meeting, can you believe it?

108
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,258
- Like an official one, too.

109
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:03,602
- [Jared] Yeah, this is not the first time

110
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:04,818
that we've done this before.

111
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:06,467
- We gathered and met.

112
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:09,207
- Before we actually
go, let's plan on when

113
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,974
we're gonna have our next
planning meeting, okay?

114
00:04:10,974 --> 00:04:13,350
We need to make sure
that we're dead ahead.

115
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,617
Do you guys ever had that done,

116
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:15,945
like when you're in a
meeting, you're like okay,

117
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:19,007
let's plan on our next planning meeting.

118
00:04:19,007 --> 00:04:20,588
- A meeting about a meeting.

119
00:04:20,588 --> 00:04:21,857
- Yeah, exactly.
- That's my favorite kind.

120
00:04:21,857 --> 00:04:23,432
- No it's the worse kind.

121
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:24,866
- Are you sad?

122
00:04:24,866 --> 00:04:25,870
- Yeah.

123
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,613
- You're sad?
- I'm sad.

124
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:29,844
- Oh I know how to make it all better.

125
00:04:29,844 --> 00:04:31,717
(kisses)

126
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:33,967
(laughing)

127
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:46,225
- Stop.

128
00:04:46,225 --> 00:04:47,464
- You want me to stop?

129
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,031
- Yeah.

130
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:50,960
(laughing)

131
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,409
- [Ellie] Hey Cal.

132
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,659
- Hey I'm busy.

133
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:58,187
He's wearing this.

134
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,994
He doesn't love it, but I do.

135
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,531
Is this not the cutest little jacket.

136
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:04,207
- It is, I want one in
my size, I really do.

137
00:05:04,207 --> 00:05:05,366
It's so cute.
- But he's wearing it.

138
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,199
- [Jared] You wear it.

139
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:09,897
- [Ellie] Come on, let's
change your bum bum.

140
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:10,858
- [Jared] Yeah, you're a stinky bum.

141
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:12,862
We've got to change your bum.

142
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:14,108
- Scarecrow.

143
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,782
- [Ellie] Scarecrow.

144
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,096
(laughs) Did you hear that?

145
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,774
- I've a gift for Grandma Great.

146
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:21,428
- [Ellie] Yeah, you're gonna
give her some seashells, huh?

147
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:22,939
- Should we go give 'em to her?

148
00:05:22,939 --> 00:05:24,823
Where did we get those seashells?

149
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:25,656
- The beach.

150
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:27,687
- On the beach at North Carolina, huh?

151
00:05:27,687 --> 00:05:28,795
- Yeah.

152
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:29,628
(Ellie laughs)

153
00:05:29,628 --> 00:05:32,619
- Oh my goodness, what do you have?

154
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,098
- [Ellie] Hi.

155
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:34,953
- [Grandma Great] Hi love.

156
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:35,786
- [Ellie] Hi.

157
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:36,647
- [Grandma Great] How are you?

158
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:38,703
- [Ellie] I'm good, how are you?

159
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,025
- Hi you.
- Hi Grandma.

160
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:41,537
- Good.
- Hey Grandma.

161
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:43,017
- Good to see you.
- How's Calvin?

162
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:44,703
- Do you have a hug for Grandma?

163
00:05:44,703 --> 00:05:45,979
- Can you give her a hug?

164
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,222
Yeah.

165
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,815
- Where did you get these?

166
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,732
- We got them from North
Carolina at the beach.

167
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,266
(Laughing)

168
00:05:56,266 --> 00:05:59,821
- And did you gather those up for Grandma?

169
00:05:59,821 --> 00:06:02,132
- For you and Grandpa.

170
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:03,299
- Awww.
- Awww.

171
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,548
- That's sweet.
- That was cute.

172
00:06:07,548 --> 00:06:08,946
- He thought about you.

173
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:11,878
He said, I have to bring
Grandma some shells.

174
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:14,001
She asked for some seashells.

175
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,040
These are his.
- Yeah.

176
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,626
- [Jared] (laughs) He's
got quite the collection.

177
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,315
- So you have a little bit.

178
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:23,337
- Oh my goodness, did
you gather up all those?

179
00:06:23,337 --> 00:06:25,914
- Yes, he, for days, he collected, days.

180
00:06:25,914 --> 00:06:27,554
- Wow

181
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,383
- [Ellie] And we brought 'em home.

182
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:30,909
- What a sweetheart.

183
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:31,742
- Yeah.
- Yes.

184
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:32,897
- Grandma has quite the collection

185
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:35,132
of seashells herself that she's gathered

186
00:06:35,132 --> 00:06:37,445
over the years growing up as a kid,

187
00:06:37,445 --> 00:06:38,753
going to all these different beaches

188
00:06:38,753 --> 00:06:40,577
and traveling with her kids on her own.

189
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:42,777
So I want to show you some of these ones.

190
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,860
Look how beautiful these are Jackson.

191
00:06:47,266 --> 00:06:48,599
Is that so cool?

192
00:06:49,738 --> 00:06:51,711
- [Jackson] Huge, big big big big.

193
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,016
- Yeah, these are so big in here.

194
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:58,103
Grandma Great has so many
wonderful trinkets and shells.

195
00:06:58,103 --> 00:06:59,683
They're so cool.
- I want to get this one.

196
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,343
- [Jared] That's a big one, huh?

197
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:02,279
I bet you could hear the ocean

198
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:04,951
really good in that one.

199
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:08,034
(chill guitar music)

200
00:07:29,558 --> 00:07:32,694
- You don't have your coat on.

201
00:07:32,694 --> 00:07:33,695
- [Jackson] I have, I do.

202
00:07:33,695 --> 00:07:35,896
- Where is he taking Grandma?

203
00:07:35,896 --> 00:07:36,914
- I don't know.
- That's so silly.

204
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,118
- We were in the middle of talking

205
00:07:38,118 --> 00:07:40,527
and he takes Grandma somewhere.

206
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,783
- You are being so cute.

207
00:07:42,783 --> 00:07:44,392
I looked at Jackson a few times today

208
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,323
and I thought, I know
what you're gonna be like

209
00:07:46,323 --> 00:07:47,403
when you're 18.

210
00:07:47,403 --> 00:07:49,911
Like it just popped into my head.

211
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:52,244
You just seem mature today.

212
00:07:53,236 --> 00:07:54,954
Your body and your head.

213
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:57,097
You just look like a big boy,

214
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,841
eating all those M & M's.

215
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:01,639
(laughs)

216
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,225
Are you gonna be a nice boy?

217
00:08:03,225 --> 00:08:04,058
- Mmm-mmm.

218
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:04,891
- [Ellie] You are.

219
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:06,725
I mean like, (laughs)

220
00:08:06,725 --> 00:08:11,381
I just feel like you'll look
just like your dad, huh?

221
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:14,214
And you'll be nice, just like him.

222
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:19,322
You're goofy.

223
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:21,975
- Bye.

224
00:08:21,975 --> 00:08:24,725
(Ellie laughing)

225
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:30,167
(chill guitar music)

226
00:08:37,178 --> 00:08:39,900
I told Jackson today he
looked, I just feel like

227
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,598
I know what he was gonna
be like when he's older.

228
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,432
- Yeah.

229
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:43,265
- [Ellie] Doesn't he just look big today.

230
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,977
- Yeah, and I think it's the outfit.

231
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:47,341
That makes so much of a difference,

232
00:08:47,341 --> 00:08:49,088
it's like you're bundled up,

233
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:50,958
you're dressed up,

234
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,003
and he's being a helper.
- You're helping.

235
00:08:52,003 --> 00:08:54,535
- [Ellie] You're starting
to learn how to work, huh?

236
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,368
- Yes.

237
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,659
- And if you work really hard,

238
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:59,375
I'll let you take me to dinner.

239
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,208
- [Jared] Ooh.

240
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,677
(Ellie laughing)

241
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:05,427
(upbeat piano music)

242
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,635
- It's a boutonniere.

243
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,171
Come on, that's from Grandma.

244
00:09:09,171 --> 00:09:10,754
Does it smell good?

245
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,714
(Ellie laughing)

246
00:09:14,714 --> 00:09:17,297
(bright music)

247
00:09:25,521 --> 00:09:26,547
- Awww.

248
00:09:26,547 --> 00:09:28,797
- [Jared] The music's over.

249
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:31,721
Music's over.

250
00:09:31,721 --> 00:09:34,270
- [Jackson] Why is it over?

251
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,853
(bright music)

252
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:52,672
- I always love going to visit my Grandma

253
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:53,840
and today was especially nice,

254
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,658
because we were able to help her out

255
00:09:55,658 --> 00:09:57,363
with some things in the
yard that she was going

256
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,952
to do today, but she said it was too cold

257
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:00,495
to do herself,

258
00:10:00,495 --> 00:10:03,373
so perfect timing for us
to make a visit there.

259
00:10:03,373 --> 00:10:05,902
And it was especially sweet seeing Jackson

260
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:08,318
interact with her, because
it was just so tender,

261
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:09,941
the way he was talking to Grandma,

262
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,181
and how much he wanted to see her

263
00:10:12,181 --> 00:10:13,309
and give those to her.

264
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,565
While we were down in town visiting her,

265
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:16,590
we made a stop at Best Buy

266
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,173
and I picked up another camera.

267
00:10:20,325 --> 00:10:22,422
As you just saw, we've been dealing

268
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,435
with so many issues with these G7 X's.

269
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:25,722
I can't remember how
many we've gone through,

270
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:27,535
like four or five of them,

271
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:30,638
but I just had to get something new

272
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:31,471
to try it out.

273
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:33,353
I think I've tried the Mark IV once before

274
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:36,526
but didn't like it, but I
know a lot of my friends,

275
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,689
Ruby and Kevin, my buddy Dalen,

276
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:39,991
a lot of people use this.

277
00:10:39,991 --> 00:10:42,600
I think Casey Neistat uses
this for his pocket camera.

278
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,079
But we're gonna try it
out and see what we think,

279
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,150
but I know with my luck, with my luck,

280
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,583
Canon's gonna come out and announce

281
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:54,392
a new G7 X probably this next month,

282
00:10:54,392 --> 00:10:56,951
Sony's gonna come out with
another one this month

283
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:57,808
or something like that,

284
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:59,367
just because I bought this today.

285
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,759
I know that's gonna happen

286
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,055
and it's gonna be right
after the return period,

287
00:11:03,055 --> 00:11:05,479
so cross your fingers that,

288
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,542
I don't know, maybe it's a
good thing, maybe it's not,

289
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:08,738
but either way, that's my luck.

290
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:11,514
Why are you so stinking cute?

291
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:12,690
You are just so cute.

292
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,605
Let's get some light on in here.

293
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:15,605
15 pumpkins.

294
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,583
- Do you think the moms will be okay,

295
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,383
if the kids put spiders on their pumpkins?

296
00:11:20,383 --> 00:11:22,141
(laughing)

297
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,574
- [Jared] Are these like gothic pumpkins?

298
00:11:24,574 --> 00:11:25,586
- I love them.

299
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,428
- [Jared] Oh good, you
got some googly eyes.

300
00:11:27,428 --> 00:11:30,570
Googly eyes on anything is hilarious.

301
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,403
- And cute.

302
00:11:31,403 --> 00:11:32,236
- [Jared] Do you think we should put

303
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:34,596
some googly eyes on Penny?

304
00:11:34,596 --> 00:11:36,220
(laughing)

305
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:39,736
- Shh, Calvin's in his bed.
- Sorry oh.

306
00:11:39,736 --> 00:11:41,317
- I have activity days
tomorrow for church,

307
00:11:41,317 --> 00:11:43,381
so I have a bunch of girls coming over,

308
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,025
and this is what we're
gonna do is paint pumpkins.

309
00:11:45,025 --> 00:11:47,544
- Awesome, this is so fun.

310
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,080
If you guys didn't know,

311
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,513
pumpkin carving is one of my favorite

312
00:11:51,513 --> 00:11:53,211
all-time activities ever.

313
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:54,044
- We'll do it this year.

314
00:11:54,044 --> 00:11:55,686
- And we will totally do it.

315
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:56,693
Here's a good question, okay.

316
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:59,140
Question for the comments down below.

317
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,057
Please vote for what I should carve

318
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:04,109
on a pumpkin this year.

319
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,220
If you see one in the
comments that you like,

320
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,691
give it the thumbs up,

321
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,246
instead of typing it again,

322
00:12:09,246 --> 00:12:12,163
so that way the top ones go to the top

323
00:12:12,163 --> 00:12:13,482
and that sort of thing.

324
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,242
And then I'll see,

325
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:16,712
I'm not gonna guarantee it,

326
00:12:16,712 --> 00:12:17,545
because this is the internet,

327
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:20,704
but I'll see if the top rated one is okay,

328
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:21,736
I'll carve that.

329
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:22,569
- [Ellie] If it's doable.

330
00:12:22,569 --> 00:12:24,646
- Yeah, if it's doable and appropriate.

331
00:12:24,646 --> 00:12:26,379
- You haven't done one really
since you've been on YouTube.

332
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,212
Have you done one?

333
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:29,901
- Well I have, but I don't
think it turned out that great.

334
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:31,978
- [Ellie] It was because it
was in our old apartment.

335
00:12:31,978 --> 00:12:32,983
- Yeah it was.

336
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:33,901
But I will have time this year,

337
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:35,587
and we'll make it happen.
- This year we will do it.

338
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:36,559
- So here's what you can do.

339
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,781
If you have a good idea,

340
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:39,046
type it in the comments down below.

341
00:12:39,046 --> 00:12:40,860
If you see that idea
or anything like that,

342
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,228
give it a thumbs up.

343
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:43,301
- [Ellie] Insert some
examples that you've done.

344
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:45,584
- Okay, I'll put some
ones from a long time ago

345
00:12:45,584 --> 00:12:47,514
that I did, just to give
you guys some ideas.

346
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:50,097
(quirky music)

347
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,219
- Uuh.

348
00:12:52,219 --> 00:12:53,371
Thanks for watching guys.

349
00:12:53,371 --> 00:00:00,000
Have a good night.
