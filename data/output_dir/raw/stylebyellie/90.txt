1
00:00:00,201 --> 00:00:01,700
- We're delivering cookies.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,533
- Yeah!

3
00:00:02,533 --> 00:00:03,366
- Lucas.
No.

4
00:00:03,366 --> 00:00:04,352
- Cayden.
No.

5
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,483
- Mason.
No.

6
00:00:05,483 --> 00:00:07,356
- Jeffrey.
No.

7
00:00:07,356 --> 00:00:08,609
(Jared gasps)

8
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,337
- Mm! Best cookie I've ever had!

9
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:14,314
(pop music)

10
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:16,814
(intro music)

11
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:20,026
- [Ellie] Did something
sneaky just happen?

12
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:21,643
- Calvin was sitting right next to you.

13
00:00:21,643 --> 00:00:23,991
He came around over here
and I was like, 'okay, yeah,

14
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:24,824
just sit over here.'

15
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,487
And he reached into my pocket

16
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:30,032
and grabbed this car for
Jackson without me knowing.

17
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,767
And we had these taken
away because you guys were

18
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:35,600
being a little too rowdy at the table.

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,131
- [Ellie] That was sneaky sneaky.

20
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:38,510
- It was sneaky and now he's going back.

21
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,808
He knew exactly what he wanted to do.

22
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:42,068
- [Ellie] Did he sneak you the car?

23
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:42,901
- Yeah.

24
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:43,734
- [Ellie] Did you tell him to do that?

25
00:00:43,734 --> 00:00:44,567
- Yeah.

26
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:45,799
- [Ellie] What?

27
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:49,002
We are doing things a little
differently today, everybody.

28
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:51,059
We went out to breakfast
this morning as a family

29
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,422
which was really fun. I love
the week before Christmas

30
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:57,040
going out to breakfast,
we always go to Herms,

31
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,682
but we are doing things different

32
00:00:58,682 --> 00:01:02,080
because we are making
a really fancy lunch,

33
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,563
and we're all going to sit
down and have a nice lunch

34
00:01:04,563 --> 00:01:08,535
because tonight, later tonight,
Jared's going to be busy

35
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,049
right now, and he's going to take Jackson,

36
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:14,166
they're going to pass out
some stuff for the neighbors

37
00:01:14,166 --> 00:01:17,760
this afternoon and then tonight
we're going to do cookies.

38
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,400
So we're all going to make
family cookies, decorate cookies,

39
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,058
have leftovers from lunch, eat that.

40
00:01:23,058 --> 00:01:25,731
But I just wanted to
have a nice meal today

41
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,292
and I thought 'Well, let's do
it for lunch and then tonight

42
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:28,213
we'll make cookies.'

43
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,975
Baked potatoes are in the oven,
I'm making pumpkin cornbread

44
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:33,418
You guys have to try this. It is so good.

45
00:01:33,418 --> 00:01:36,545
I'm going to tell you
the recipe right now.

46
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,029
I'm just going to show you this

47
00:01:38,029 --> 00:01:40,299
so if you want to take a
picture, take a picture.

48
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,293
That's for the honey butter on the side.

49
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:45,802
But this is all that goes in
just the pumpkin cornbread.

50
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,348
You literally put it all together,

51
00:01:47,348 --> 00:01:50,433
you mix it up, you put
it in the oven at 375,

52
00:01:50,433 --> 00:01:53,347
wait til it's done, about
20 minutes, pull it out.

53
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,789
It's so good with baked
potatoes, a side of vegetables,

54
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:59,388
some ham, some rolls, really good.

55
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:02,642
- [Ellie] My boys are
making me some honey butter.

56
00:02:02,642 --> 00:02:04,569
Calvin, how's your lip?

57
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,887
Is it good?

58
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:06,720
- No. Ow.

59
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:10,342
- Yeah, it's an owie.
It's much better today.

60
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,436
It looks worse because
there's that big bandaid.

61
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:15,241
There's a little butterfly
bandaid underneath that's holding

62
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:19,329
his lip together and it
looks really good and healed.

63
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:21,892
We probably didn't have to
have it today but I wanted to

64
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:22,782
just in case.

65
00:02:22,782 --> 00:02:25,221
- [Jackson] I'm going to push
to stop. Is this to stop?

66
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,388
- [Ellie] Yes.

67
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,289
(mixer stops)

68
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,239
- [Ellie] Good job.

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,981
- [Jared] Ellis, this
all looks so fantastic.

70
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,079
You have outdone yourself yet again.

71
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,301
Look at this!

72
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:37,987
We got ham, we got bread, we
got potatoes, we got cheese

73
00:02:37,987 --> 00:02:39,217
sour cream!

74
00:02:39,217 --> 00:02:40,957
- I was really so excited for the broccoli

75
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:42,380
and I forgot to cook it.

76
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,213
- [Jared] Oh, no.

77
00:02:43,213 --> 00:02:45,418
- But I'm too hungry now,
I'm like, 'It can wait.'

78
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:48,120
- You know what, I'm actually
glad you forgot the broccoli.

79
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,961
- Oh, poo.

80
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:50,951
- It's not that I don't like
broccoli. I like broccoli.

81
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:52,299
Especially killer broccoli.

82
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,994
I'm glad you forgot the broccoli because,

83
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:54,931
let's be honest --

84
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,131
- You sound like a radio.

85
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,157
- Your farts are a little stinky as it is.

86
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:03,737
I don't think broccoli is
going to help at all with that.

87
00:03:03,737 --> 00:03:06,741
- Come on, let's sit down
guys. Mom wants us to sit down.

88
00:03:06,741 --> 00:03:09,340
- We're talking about stuff
at lunch with the kids

89
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,090
that has to do with

90
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,937
your bad example.
- Potty talk.

91
00:03:13,937 --> 00:03:16,160
What about being
grateful, you little turd?

92
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,947
- Okay. I guess we're going
to have that discussion now.

93
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,033
- Which one's mine?

94
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,554
This one's mine because
I put sour cream on it.

95
00:03:20,554 --> 00:03:22,095
You eat the sour cream one.

96
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:24,189
- [Jared] No.
Be grateful.

97
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:28,356
- ...Mother and Father. Thank
you for this day. What now?

98
00:03:29,474 --> 00:03:31,403
- Thank you for our blessings.

99
00:03:31,403 --> 00:03:34,581
- Thank you for our blessings. Amen.

100
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,414
- Amen.

101
00:03:36,392 --> 00:03:39,809
- We are talking a lot
about being grateful

102
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:43,472
and that we are grateful for
what we get no matter what.

103
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:45,889
And we talked a lot at lunch.

104
00:03:47,068 --> 00:03:49,386
You want some more ham?

105
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:50,683
- No, it's gone.

106
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:52,400
- [Ellie] More ham.

107
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,044
Right there, you want
more ham right there?

108
00:03:54,044 --> 00:03:57,347
I think it's so funny that
Calvin has not only eaten his ham

109
00:03:57,347 --> 00:04:00,473
he's eaten Jackson's ham and
now he's asking for more.

110
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:04,403
And he has always been such a good eater.

111
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:05,834
He's never been picky.

112
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:08,667
And Jackson wasn't the best eater,

113
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:12,689
but I don't know what to compare it to.

114
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:15,647
I just know that we had
a hard time sometimes

115
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:19,949
getting him to eat, but I told
him how proud I was of him.

116
00:04:19,949 --> 00:04:22,425
Lately, he's been just
eating what we give him.

117
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:24,234
We were at Bonnie's and
Bonnie got lasagna out

118
00:04:24,234 --> 00:04:26,260
and I saw him looking at it for a minute

119
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,948
and then he just ate it and
I was like, 'that was good!'

120
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:30,733
- That is, if Calvin doesn't eat it first.

121
00:04:30,733 --> 00:04:34,249
- [Ellie] Yeah, because he's
crazy and eats everyone's food.

122
00:04:34,249 --> 00:04:37,265
- Boys, when we get a gift from someone,

123
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,313
no matter how big, how small --

124
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:41,608
- [Ellie] Or if it's one or a lot,

125
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:43,123
- What do we say?

126
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:43,956
- Thank you?

127
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:44,789
- That's right.

128
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:47,565
- Parenting is so interesting.
Nobody has it the perfect way

129
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:49,532
nobody knows exactly how you should do it,

130
00:04:49,532 --> 00:04:52,491
it's just kind of based on your own kids.

131
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:55,164
But I do remember one
thing that I really liked,

132
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:59,632
is my parents would always
talk about scenarios with us.

133
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,316
Even when I was younger,
they would talk about

134
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:04,888
marriage scenarios, and
'what if', like money,

135
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:07,363
like, 'what if you lose
your job, what do you do?'

136
00:05:07,363 --> 00:05:10,601
They just always talked about
scenarios and I don't know why

137
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,194
maybe their parents did that,

138
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:15,875
but I do think that's
one of the biggest things

139
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:20,005
that my parents did that did
help me, and that I remember

140
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:23,892
and that I have tried
to do in our parenting.

141
00:05:23,892 --> 00:05:26,245
And our kids are young.

142
00:05:26,245 --> 00:05:29,123
He's almost four and he's two and a half.

143
00:05:29,123 --> 00:05:33,041
They're so young but I
do feel like it helps.

144
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,662
Four-year-olds sometimes can
be like, 'What, just what?'

145
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:38,615
It's like, 'no, we be grateful'.

146
00:05:38,615 --> 00:05:42,371
We're just trying our
hardest with parenting

147
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:46,421
and I feel like so far, I'm
okay with how things are going.

148
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,782
- And think of it this
way: You remember that

149
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,607
one of the most things
about what your parents did.

150
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:52,684
If you keep that up,

151
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,267
that's going to be
something they remember.

152
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,264
Like role-playing situations
like that, and just asking,

153
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:59,603
'what would you do', and
then talking about that.

154
00:05:59,603 --> 00:06:01,089
That's a great idea.

155
00:06:01,089 --> 00:06:02,614
- [Ellie] What was one
thing your parents did

156
00:06:02,614 --> 00:06:03,675
that you loved?

157
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:07,842
- My mom and dad would
always just talk to me about

158
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:12,935
gratitude and having a positive attitude.

159
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:17,161
I mean, that's one thing my
dad always said is 'A.I.E.,

160
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:18,536
Attitude Is Everything.'

161
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:20,119
So I would just try and remember that.

162
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:21,257
- [Ellie] And bubbles.

163
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:24,024
- Blowing bubbles and
having a positive attitude

164
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:27,047
about things, which is
always make me think better

165
00:06:27,047 --> 00:06:31,214
of situations and that would
develop into things like

166
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:35,828
gratitude and happiness and
joy and that sort of thing.

167
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,572
- [Ellie] I like that.

168
00:06:37,572 --> 00:06:38,511
- All done!

169
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:39,579
- Good job.

170
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:40,510
- Grant?
No.

171
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,870
- [Ellie] I like the name Grant.

172
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,397
Jackson, Calvin and Grant.

173
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,480
- No, that's a girl name.

174
00:06:47,316 --> 00:06:49,664
- [Ellie] Jackson, Calvin, Grant.

175
00:06:49,664 --> 00:06:52,719
- Any name that Jackson
doesn't like is a girl name.

176
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:54,037
- Malcolm?
No.

177
00:06:54,037 --> 00:06:55,519
- In the Middle?
No.

178
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,664
- Lucas.
No.

179
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:57,665
- Cayden.
No.

180
00:06:57,665 --> 00:06:58,842
- Mason.
No.

181
00:06:58,842 --> 00:07:00,289
- Jeffrey.
No.

182
00:07:00,289 --> 00:07:01,414
- Marcus.
No.

183
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:02,468
- Junior.
No.

184
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:03,840
- Declan.
No.

185
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,486
- Jesus.
No.

186
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:06,915
- Cyrus.
No.

187
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:08,448
- Tian.
No.

188
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:09,282
- Cody.

189
00:07:09,282 --> 00:07:10,676
- Yeah!

190
00:07:10,676 --> 00:07:11,632
- You like Cody?

191
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:12,748
- Yeah.

192
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:13,581
- Okay.

193
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:14,852
- [Ellie] I think it's fun that Jackson's

194
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:16,379
been really involved.

195
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:17,233
- Pizza.

196
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,733
- No. That's food!

197
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:22,139
- You're right.

198
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:23,662
- [Ellie] This morning we were in the car

199
00:07:23,662 --> 00:07:25,752
and Jared left the car and Jackson goes,

200
00:07:25,752 --> 00:07:28,752
'Mom, can't we just name him Mason?'

201
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:31,422
- Do you like the name Mason?

202
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,819
- No. I love Cody.

203
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,107
- You like Cody?

204
00:07:34,107 --> 00:07:34,940
- Mm-hmm.

205
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:35,773
- Okay, it's official.

206
00:07:35,773 --> 00:07:37,898
Our baby's name is Cody.
- [Ellie] No it's not.

207
00:07:37,898 --> 00:07:40,184
I'm making sugar cookies.

208
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,855
- And I am emailing the four winners--

209
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:45,251
I'm getting emotional, the four winners --

210
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:47,234
- [Ellie] Don't hit
yourself. That's not nice.

211
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,626
(imitates gorilla)

212
00:07:48,626 --> 00:07:51,418
Be a man!
(mock punch)

213
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:54,966
- I'm emailing the winners
of the IVF Grant contest

214
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:59,471
and I'm being sneaky, and
I'm emailing them and saying

215
00:07:59,471 --> 00:08:02,172
that I want some more
information before we go further

216
00:08:02,172 --> 00:08:03,985
and then we're going to surprise them

217
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,852
on a phone call or a video chat.

218
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,180
So I'm hoping this works out.

219
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,112
This is kind of what we did last year.

220
00:08:10,112 --> 00:08:13,892
So hopefully they're not
too suspicious about things

221
00:08:13,892 --> 00:08:15,677
and it's a complete surprise.

222
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:18,685
- [Ellie] Who is ready to make cookies?

223
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:20,040
- [Jackson] Me.

224
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,446
- [Ellie] Calvin, you ready?

225
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:22,684
- [Calvin] Yeah!

226
00:08:22,684 --> 00:08:25,702
- Yes! Okay, so it was like we had lunch

227
00:08:25,702 --> 00:08:26,898
and then it's dinnertime.

228
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:30,098
I took a nap, a really long nap.

229
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:33,903
I put a show on and I said,
'Kids, Mommy's going to rest

230
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:38,222
until we watch a movie. And
they both laid by my side

231
00:08:38,222 --> 00:08:40,984
one on one arm while I
rested and it was beautiful.

232
00:08:40,985 --> 00:08:43,318
And I am so so appreciative.

233
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:44,645
- Where are the cookies?

234
00:08:44,645 --> 00:08:45,998
- [Ellie] We got to make them.

235
00:08:45,998 --> 00:08:47,870
So I'm going to lay it right here,

236
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,926
we're going to roll them out

237
00:08:48,926 --> 00:08:51,336
and you can put the cookies, cut them out.

238
00:08:51,336 --> 00:08:53,269
And a lot of them are
going to look like this.

239
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:58,038
I did a few just because I
wanted a few really nice ones.

240
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,112
- [Jackson] I want to roll it.

241
00:08:59,112 --> 00:09:01,436
- [Ellie] Do you want to roll it? Okay.

242
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:03,560
You're already starting
the choo-choo train?

243
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,882
- Yeah.

244
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:07,632
(acoustic music)

245
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:19,260
- [Ellie] Doesn't that look good?

246
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,010
(acoustic music)

247
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,444
- [Ellie] What one did you get?

248
00:09:34,444 --> 00:09:35,777
Gingerbread man?

249
00:09:36,775 --> 00:09:38,222
Look how good those look, Cal.

250
00:09:38,222 --> 00:09:40,916
Okay, do a choo-choo train, Jacks.

251
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,139
So push it really hard all the way

252
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,779
and you can make a choo-choo
train. Is that cool?

253
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:47,232
- A choo-choo train?

254
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:48,638
- [Ellie] Yeah.

255
00:09:48,638 --> 00:09:49,879
- I wanna eat it.

256
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,258
- [Ellie] We gotta cook it first.

257
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,530
- Okay, boys, what are we doing?

258
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,397
- We're delivering cookies.

259
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:57,377
- Yeah, we've got our favorite cookies,

260
00:09:57,377 --> 00:09:59,931
our favorite snacks, swig
cookies, and we're delivering them

261
00:09:59,931 --> 00:10:01,482
to all the neighbors in the house.

262
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:03,610
All the neighbors in the neighborhood.

263
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,124
Yeah, that's where they
live, is our neighborhood.

264
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,483
So we've got a box of cookies

265
00:10:07,483 --> 00:10:09,649
and the boys are taking them door to door.

266
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:10,582
- Yeah.

267
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:11,437
- [Jared] Yeah. And what do we say

268
00:10:11,437 --> 00:10:13,496
when we knock on the door?

269
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:15,196
- Merry Christmas!

270
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:16,982
- [Jared] Merry Christmas!

271
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:19,221
Did you boys both just fall?

272
00:10:19,221 --> 00:10:20,054
- Yeah.

273
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,392
- [Jared] It's so slippery.

274
00:10:21,392 --> 00:10:23,710
It's so slippery. Woo!

275
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,627
Woo! It is so slippery.

276
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,168
Careful! Whoa!

277
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:32,888
(Jared laughs)

278
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:33,853
- I'm skating!

279
00:10:33,853 --> 00:10:35,529
- [Jared] Yeah, it's like ice skating.

280
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:36,661
- Look at me.

281
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:38,994
- [Jared] Yeah, look at you.

282
00:10:39,976 --> 00:10:42,229
Okay, you ready Calvin? Here ya go.

283
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:44,479
Let's go to the next house.

284
00:10:45,483 --> 00:10:47,114
Yeah, that one. Let's go.

285
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,897
What do you see?

286
00:10:48,897 --> 00:10:50,157
- Cookies?

287
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:51,492
- [Jared] Cookies!

288
00:10:51,492 --> 00:10:54,167
Wait, let's take our coats, our shoes off,

289
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,989
and we'll wash our hands.

290
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,604
Whew! Boy, Ellie, I will tell you

291
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:01,604
my hip is burning, burning, burning.

292
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,541
So we went around the whole
neighborhood and we delivered

293
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,573
those swig cookies
boxes but not only that,

294
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:11,898
I did some Secret Santa stuff
that I can't tell you about

295
00:11:11,898 --> 00:11:15,327
but I was racing because I did
some like ding-dong ditching

296
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,957
with gifts and stuff.

297
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:20,759
So anyway, but my hips are
burning so decorating cookies

298
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:23,577
sounds like the perfect
way to rest my little hip

299
00:11:23,577 --> 00:11:27,227
and to get a little salivation going.

300
00:11:27,227 --> 00:11:30,453
- Sugar cookies can either
be really gross or good.

301
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,648
Honestly, if you overcook
them, they're gross.

302
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:34,910
I think these are good.

303
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,842
- [Jared] Perfect.

304
00:11:35,842 --> 00:11:37,640
Oh, we can't do it yet,
we've got to wash our hands

305
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,995
and then you've got to
decorate them first.

306
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:40,615
Are you ready to decorate?

307
00:11:40,615 --> 00:11:41,716
- Yeah!

308
00:11:41,716 --> 00:11:43,155
- [Jared] Are you ready to decorate?

309
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,049
- Yeah.

310
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:45,087
(cookie falls)

311
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:46,574
(Jared laughs)

312
00:11:46,574 --> 00:11:47,532
- [Jared] Poor cookie.

313
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:48,662
Are you ready to decorate?

314
00:11:48,662 --> 00:11:49,911
- Yeah!

315
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:52,280
- Let's decorate some cookies!

316
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,778
- Jackson, good job, you're
already starting, mister.

317
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:58,013
- [Jared] Look at that. Not
wasting any time at all.

318
00:11:58,013 --> 00:11:59,787
I think this calls for a cookie montage.

319
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:02,204
(jazz music)

320
00:12:21,652 --> 00:12:25,516
- [Jared] Yeah, it's cute.
I think you get a gold star!

321
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:27,613
- I'm putting these on top,
we'll make it look like --

322
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,034
- [Jared] Yeah. Ellie,
that's stinking cute.

323
00:12:30,034 --> 00:12:31,996
- The black color has orange flavoring.

324
00:12:31,996 --> 00:12:33,579
- [Jared] Ooh, yum.

325
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:36,866
Delicious to the taste?

326
00:12:36,866 --> 00:12:39,283
(jazz music)

327
00:12:59,421 --> 00:13:01,592
- No! This is crazy!

328
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,442
I just built this perfect snowman

329
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:04,763
with the icing and everything

330
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,945
and I was like, 'Ellie, do
you want to see my snowman?'

331
00:13:06,945 --> 00:13:09,695
And as I was doing that, the bag

332
00:13:10,761 --> 00:13:12,896
caught the edge of the snowman.

333
00:13:12,896 --> 00:13:14,300
- [Ellie] It looks really --

334
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,757
- [Jared] It's like --
(Jared gasps)

335
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:20,257
Mm! Best cookie I've ever had.

336
00:13:21,693 --> 00:13:23,004
(mumbles)

337
00:13:23,004 --> 00:13:24,150
- What did you just do?

338
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,948
What did you just do? Oh, my gosh.

339
00:13:25,948 --> 00:13:27,628
Look at your belly!

340
00:13:27,628 --> 00:13:29,069
That's cute, Ellie.

341
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:32,047
I'm kind of embarrassed to admit this.

342
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:34,066
I'll get to that point real quick.

343
00:13:34,066 --> 00:13:36,454
So tomorrow we're having
a family Christmas party

344
00:13:36,454 --> 00:13:39,903
and part of that family Christmas
party is a lip-sync battle

345
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:41,635
and we came up with a song.

346
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:42,920
Well, actually we didn't come up with it,

347
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,201
I asked my sister Melanie, 'We
need a song to lip sync to.

348
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:47,884
What should we do?'

349
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:50,371
And the first thing that my
sister said, of course, was

350
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,371
- 'Beyonce'!

351
00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:54,260
(sings "Single Ladies")

352
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,093
- "Single Ladies."

353
00:13:55,093 --> 00:13:57,809
So Ellie and I are making
up our own dance right now

354
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,153
the day before this lip sync battle

355
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:00,986
and we're practicing the dance.

356
00:14:00,986 --> 00:14:03,553
- We weren't going to do
it. I was gonna be like,

357
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:06,260
because we haven't literally
had a second to do it.

358
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,230
And Jared's like, 'Let's
just practice and we'll see.'

359
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,319
And it's taken an hour and we
pretty much have something.

360
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,401
So I'm excited.

361
00:14:12,401 --> 00:14:14,070
- And we're going to attempt
to show you right now.

362
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,409
But no laughing. Promise?

363
00:14:15,409 --> 00:14:17,417
- It's going to be cute
and part of the family.

364
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,250
- Okay, here we go.

365
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,408
Oh my gosh. I can't
believe I'm doing this.

366
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:20,389
- [Ellie] It's cute.

367
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:21,776
- I don't know about copyright stuff

368
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:22,749
but we're just going to throw it in there.

369
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:23,752
- Yeah.

370
00:14:23,752 --> 00:14:25,613
- If I have to put music
over it, I put music over it.

371
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:26,984
Just imagine "All the Single Ladies."

372
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:28,797

but we're getting there.
It's going to be cute.

381

- I'm sweaty already.

- I think it's cute, I don't
know what it will look like.

family Christmas thing

386
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:41,064
that is so not my family but

387
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:45,035
Landon had the wonderful idea
to do it so we're gonna do it.

388
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:45,868
- Are you kidding me?

389
00:15:45,868 --> 00:15:48,505
This is going to be the
best night ever tomorrow.

390
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:50,844
- Can't wait. So fun.

391
00:15:50,844 --> 00:15:55,356
We just got done calling the
IVF winners and telling them.

392
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:57,195
- Although, we have one more
phone call to do tomorrow.

393
00:15:57,195 --> 00:15:59,174
- It's been a very emotional night.

394
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:03,073
It's been emotional, I mean
learning Beyonce is emotional.

395
00:16:03,073 --> 00:16:07,226
It was emotional because not
only did we tell a handful

396
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:08,807
of people that they won a grant but

397
00:16:08,807 --> 00:16:10,656
there's a lot of people that didn't.

398
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:13,451
And there was a lot of
people that applied for this

399
00:16:13,451 --> 00:16:15,577
last year that applied
for it again this year,

400
00:16:15,577 --> 00:16:18,568
then we had a lot of friends
apply for it this year.

401
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:19,401
- Yeah.

402
00:16:19,401 --> 00:16:21,391
- That's really hard.

403
00:16:21,391 --> 00:16:24,970
We had some extended
family, a lot of you guys.

404
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,137
It's been a crazy Christmas
week for everybody involved.

405
00:16:30,313 --> 00:16:33,726
So, thank you everybody for participating.

406
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,994

support, your patience

407
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:37,866
and we're grateful for you.

408
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:41,449
- We are. This is the
biggest thing for us.

409
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,935
To look back on, to tell
our kids that the one thing

410
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,601
that came from us doing this is us

411
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:49,754
being able to give back
like this is priceless.

412
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:50,610
- Absolutely.

413
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,868
- And I'm very grateful and
I hope our kids can know that

414
00:16:52,868 --> 00:16:55,761
and see that in the future.

415
00:16:55,761 --> 00:16:59,012
Guys, let's rock this Beyonce dance.

416
00:16:59,012 --> 00:16:59,958
- We got it.

417
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,612

00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:05,188
Thank you guys. We hope you
guys have an awesome week.

Merry Christmas and we'll
see you guys tomorrow.

421
00:17:09,276 --> 00:17:12,878
- Tomorrow at the Griffith's
family Christmas party.

422
00:17:12,878 --> 00:17:14,775
- Get ready because it's gonna be crazy!

423
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:15,784
- Who's going to win the lip sync?

424
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:18,428
I can picture Landon and Julia
doing a pretty dang good job.

425
00:17:18,428 --> 00:17:19,903
- I think so too.
They're always fun like that.

426
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,653
- But my bet's on us.

427
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:24,564
- We gotta learn these words better.

428
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:26,471
- Let me know, is it
possible to beat Beyonce?

429
00:17:26,471 --> 00:17:28,510
♪ Whoa oh oh oh oh oh ♪

430
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,000
♪ Shake those hips girl ♪

431
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,167
- Oh, that's the other thing.

432
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:32,886
So my hips are hurting twice today.

433
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:33,719
- I know.

434
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,440
- Because of running
the Secret Santa stuff

435
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,926
and dancing to Beyonce.

436
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:39,329
She's like Shakira. Her hips don't lie.

437
00:17:39,329 --> 00:00:00,000
Okay? See ya.
