1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:03,736
(bright guitar music)

2
00:00:18,739 --> 00:00:20,893
- Well look who decided
to get out of bed today

3
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:21,726
and get dressed.

4
00:00:21,726 --> 00:00:22,964
I'm out of bed.

5
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,683
It supposedly snowed
today up in the canyon.

6
00:00:25,683 --> 00:00:26,676
It's raining.

7
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:28,759
Today is cold, it is fall

8
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:32,134
and it actually feels kind of fun and cozy

9
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,020
to be inside.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,300
I'm getting dressed and ready for the day.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,504
Because I feel like getting ready

12
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:39,601
and I want to try Bonnie's
curling iron again.

13
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,618
So that's what we're doing.

14
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:41,698
We're up for the day.

15
00:00:41,698 --> 00:00:42,759
- It's chilly.
- Up and at 'em.

16
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,926
- It's chilly.

17
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:45,948
- [Jared] Hi.

18
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:47,812
Bonk.

19
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:52,747
Oh Calvin, don't bonk your head on that.

20
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:54,802
You are so crazy.

21
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:55,635
Hey,

22
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:57,627
bonk.

23
00:00:57,627 --> 00:01:00,318
(laughing)

24
00:01:00,318 --> 00:01:01,783
Calvin, are you ready?

25
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:04,322
I've got your shoes and your socks.

26
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:05,547
- No no.

27
00:01:05,547 --> 00:01:06,380
- You know what?
- You don't want,

28
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,096
- I said Calvin, do you want

29
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,315
to go play with Lincoln?

30
00:01:09,315 --> 00:01:10,506
- Not.

31
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:11,944
- He's hiding his toy, saying it's mine.

32
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:13,390
- [Jared] Awww.

33
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,307
Hey, let's get your
shoes and socks on okay?

34
00:01:15,307 --> 00:01:17,184
- I'll go with you.

35
00:01:17,184 --> 00:01:18,653
- [Jared] Do you want to go?

36
00:01:18,653 --> 00:01:19,505
- You want Mommy to go too?

37
00:01:19,505 --> 00:01:21,576
- [Jared] Look at his handsome hair.

38
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:23,824
I love his hair when
it's like pushed over.

39
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:24,657
Let's get on your shoes,

40
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:25,577
here, come here.

41
00:01:25,577 --> 00:01:26,410
- Mommy.

42
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,078
- [Jared] You want Mommy
to put your shoes on?

43
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:29,200
- This hair.

44
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,664
- Is that her hair?
- Mommy's hair is pretty too?

45
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:31,497
- [Jared] Is her hair pretty?

46
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:32,330
- Mmm-mmm.

47
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,163
- [Jared] Aww.

48
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:33,996
- Okay, let's put your shoes on.

49
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:34,829
- So I was in the living room,

50
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:35,663
trying to get Calvin's shoes on

51
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:38,144
and he said, no, Mommy shoes.

52
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:40,046
And I was like you want
Mommy to put on your shoes?

53
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:40,879
And he said uh-huh,

54
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,555
and I said, no, I'll put your shoes on.

55
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:44,618
He's like nooo, and ran in here.

56
00:01:44,618 --> 00:01:46,354
(laughing)

57
00:01:46,354 --> 00:01:47,907
I wanted to see if he would say it again.

58
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:48,740
- You're a pill.

59
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,980
- You are a pill, a handsome pill at that.

60
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,938
- We're gonna go to Aunt Bonnie's,

61
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:54,059
and you're gonna play with Lincoln.

62
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:55,414
- [Jared] Yay.

63
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:56,722
He says mine again.

64
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:57,712
Don't be a little

65
00:01:57,712 --> 00:01:59,784
- [Jared] Don't be a silly ragamuffin.

66
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,617
- We gotta share.

67
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:01,934
- [Jared] We share our toys, kay?

68
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:03,463
Lincoln's gonna share his toys

69
00:02:03,463 --> 00:02:04,729
and you can share your toys.

70
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:05,562
Sound good?

71
00:02:05,562 --> 00:02:06,395
- Yeah.

72
00:02:06,395 --> 00:02:07,669
- [Jared] Okay, good boy.

73
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,311
- [Ellie] Look at the
snow on the mountain.

74
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:10,204
- [Jared] No!

75
00:02:10,204 --> 00:02:11,739
(Ellie laughs)

76
00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:13,147
(banging piano)

77
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:13,980
- Wow.

78
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:16,669
The first time Calvin did
that and it made noise,

79
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:19,054
he looked at me and he went,

80
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:21,061
as if he did something bad.

81
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,489
- Mine mine mine mine mine.

82
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,756
- [Ellie] Well you know what Lincoln?

83
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:24,985
That's what Calvin said, when I said

84
00:02:24,985 --> 00:02:26,082
we were gonna play with you.

85
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:28,959
He said mine mine mine mine mine.

86
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:29,853
(laughing)

87
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:32,939
So I'm glad both of you boys are selfish,

88
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,305
and not just one.
- Mine, mine!

89
00:02:34,305 --> 00:02:37,069
- [Ellie] Hey, I'm here to
borrow your curling iron again.

90
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:39,616
You're not selfish, we share.

91
00:02:39,616 --> 00:02:40,889
(laughing)

92
00:02:40,889 --> 00:02:42,064
I just got done curling my hair.

93
00:02:42,064 --> 00:02:43,489
A lot of people asked questions

94
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:44,895
about what it was last time.

95
00:02:44,895 --> 00:02:47,203
It's the Beachwaver, I'm
sure they have a website,

96
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:48,060
if you google one.

97
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,324
I'll try and find a link somewhere

98
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:50,254
to have it in the description.

99
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,904
But, thank you Bonnie.

100
00:02:51,904 --> 00:02:52,737
- You're welcome.

101
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,732
- I really like it.

102
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:54,565
- [Bonnie] It's cute.

103
00:02:54,565 --> 00:02:55,896
Do you feel like it's a different curl?

104
00:02:55,896 --> 00:02:57,375
- I feel like it's a different curl.

105
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,988
- [Bonnie] Yeah, I do too.

106
00:02:58,988 --> 00:02:59,821
- I don't know how the back looks,

107
00:02:59,821 --> 00:03:01,702
but I bet it's kind of fun and cute.

108
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:02,535
I just have to spray it.

109
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:03,379
Thank you.

110
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:04,352
I feel
- Yeah.

111
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,189
- I feel good today.

112
00:03:05,189 --> 00:03:06,022
- You look good today.

113
00:03:06,022 --> 00:03:07,882
- My eyes are still like
tired, but I feel good.

114
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:08,715
(laughs)

115
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:09,946
- [Jared] Oh jeez.

116
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:10,779
Oh jeez.

117
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:12,473
- Two three four

118
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:13,806
- [Jared] Oh no!

119
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,424
Okay okay, that was good.

120
00:03:16,424 --> 00:03:18,441
I think every kid has done this at least

121
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:19,409
one point in their life,

122
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:22,159
at least until something happens.

123
00:03:24,089 --> 00:03:25,745
I'm kind of nervous, I don't
want to watch this happen,

124
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:26,578
but ahhh!

125
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:29,341
(laughing)

126
00:03:29,341 --> 00:03:31,118
Oh jeez, why don't you guys
do it more in the middle,

127
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,379
so you're not so close to that corner,

128
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,212
that makes me nervous.

129
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,695
This whole thing makes me nervous,

130
00:03:34,695 --> 00:03:36,715
but I know you guys
are having so much fun.

131
00:03:36,715 --> 00:03:38,256
- Fight!

132
00:03:38,256 --> 00:03:40,506
(laughing)

133
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,442
- Hey boys, why don't we
quit while we're ahead?

134
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:45,521
No one's injured, we had a great time,

135
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:47,176
let's be done.

136
00:03:47,176 --> 00:03:48,057
No?

137
00:03:48,057 --> 00:03:48,904
Oh good.

138
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:49,737
(laughing)

139
00:03:49,737 --> 00:03:50,570
- Go!

140
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,982
(laughing)

141
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,065
- Oh, down for the count.

142
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,537
Now Jackson, if you want to win,

143
00:03:56,537 --> 00:03:57,370
you got to get low.

144
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,254
You gotta be lower than the person, kay?

145
00:03:59,254 --> 00:04:00,776
Use your center of gravity.

146
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:01,946
Get down in there, dig deep.

147
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:03,344
Dig deep.

148
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:05,594
(laughing)

149
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:08,574
- Ow.

150
00:04:08,574 --> 00:04:09,848
- You got him.

151
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:11,199
You didn't even have to run.

152
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,032
Ready?

153
00:04:12,032 --> 00:04:12,865
You run hard

154
00:04:12,865 --> 00:04:14,502
and you run fast.
- One, two.

155
00:04:14,502 --> 00:04:15,667
- [Jared] Go!

156
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:16,500
- Go!

157
00:04:18,796 --> 00:04:19,976
- [Jared] You guys are so strong.

158
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,241
(Jared laughing)

159
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,464
- When it comes to vlogging,

160
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:25,297
what we really try and do is
show you what we are doing

161
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:28,017
rather than tell you what we are doing.

162
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,982
I would say today is just a little fail,

163
00:04:29,982 --> 00:04:32,405
because I am telling you what I did

164
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,829
rather than show you what I did.

165
00:04:33,829 --> 00:04:36,029
We did put some fall stuff up,

166
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,453
so I'm gonna show you around the house.

167
00:04:37,453 --> 00:04:40,576
When you walk in, we have a
few fall pillows right there.

168
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:42,899
I'm not a huge decorator,
I'm getting there.

169
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,114
On this wall, I want to get a bunch

170
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:47,946
of picture frames and do
two rows of picture frames

171
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:50,738
of the family, the kids, grandparents.

172
00:04:50,738 --> 00:04:51,571
- Was I a good Vanna?

173
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:52,783
- [Ellie] You're so good.

174
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:55,592
And then of course, my
friend just painted that.

175
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:56,608
- [Jared] I still love it.

176
00:04:56,608 --> 00:04:58,933
- [Ellie] I will have her
Instagram in the description.

177
00:04:58,933 --> 00:05:00,357
She's so, I love her.

178
00:05:00,357 --> 00:05:02,717
On this little stand (laughs),

179
00:05:02,717 --> 00:05:05,946
we have been able to keep
this little plant alive for

180
00:05:05,946 --> 00:05:06,779
- [Jared] Since we moved in, right?

181
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:07,937
- [Ellie] Yes, almost a year.

182
00:05:07,937 --> 00:05:08,770
- That's crazy.

183
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,492
We've been in our house for almost a year.

184
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:14,188
- Yeah, so that plant, I'm
proud, that we have not killed.

185
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:17,156
Anna Anderson painted
that for me last year,

186
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:19,708
so that has that on it.

187
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:23,572
This over here I got from
Hobby Lobby this year.

188
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:27,265
My friend gave me this,
with not this miscarriage

189
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:30,312
but my last, and I was so sad,

190
00:05:30,312 --> 00:05:33,111
when I killed it, and I almost cried.

191
00:05:33,111 --> 00:05:35,094
I don't know why it meant so much for me,

192
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,628
but it really did when she gave it to me,

193
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,938
and it came back alive and I was so happy.

194
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:41,163
So that's the plant that she gave me,

195
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:41,996
so I love that.

196
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:43,546
A sweet viewer made this for us,

197
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,472
so that's that stand.

198
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:46,848
I haven't really done that
much up there for fall.

199
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,545
For Christmas, I usually do.

200
00:05:48,545 --> 00:05:49,614
This I'm in love with.

201
00:05:49,614 --> 00:05:51,676
I got this from Hobby Lobby this year

202
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:54,294
and this is a heavy
stone from Hobby Lobby.

203
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:56,127
And then my friend Anna Anderson painted

204
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:57,761
that last year for me, so.

205
00:05:57,761 --> 00:05:59,183
- This is so like

206
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:00,016
- [Ellie] I love that.

207
00:06:00,016 --> 00:06:01,884
- It's like deceiving,
because you think it's one

208
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:04,000
of those hollow pumpkins, but it's like

209
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,833
(knocking stone)

210
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,666
- [Ellie] It's heavy.

211
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:06,499
- Yeah, it's crazy.
- Owie, that hurts me

212
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,332
- [Ellie] just thinking about it,

213
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:08,574
so there's that, right there.

214
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:11,105
Whoa, it's heavy, you want me to help you?

215
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:11,938
Whoa.

216
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:16,802
And then, this I thought
was cute for fall.

217
00:06:16,802 --> 00:06:18,314
I have a few plants in there,

218
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:20,469
and down here, I'll put
some fall stuff later

219
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,173
when I get something for
that, so there's that.

220
00:06:23,173 --> 00:06:26,483
Okay, now for the fun of
fall, I will show you.

221
00:06:26,483 --> 00:06:29,291
I got all of this last
year when we moved in.

222
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:33,190
And it's very simple, but it's
very warming and welcoming.

223
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,241
So all of that was from
Hobby Lobby last year

224
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,844
and the pillows were from Target.

225
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:38,963
So pillows are on the couch,

226
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:40,784
and the fireplace is done.

227
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:43,210
So pretty simple, but that's
what we have for fall.

228
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,937
And I like it.
- I love this down here.

229
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:47,157
- Yeah, it looks really
different down here,

230
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,165
but it's not like so crazy.

231
00:06:49,165 --> 00:06:51,822
The thing about fall
in Utah is I don't feel

232
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:53,750
like there's a really great transition

233
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,508
from summer to fall.

234
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:56,350
It's just like

235
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,183
- Right away.

236
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:58,016
- Yesterday or the day before,

237
00:06:58,016 --> 00:07:01,630
it was like 90 degrees and today
it's like boom, 60 degrees.

238
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,463
It's chilly.

239
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,673
- I think it's actually been 55.

240
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,592
- It's chilly outside.

241
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,425
- It's chilly.

242
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,535
- It's chilly.

243
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:08,389
- It's chilly.

244
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,734
- It's been a cold one today.

245
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:12,335
I mean so cold that Mr. Jackson
had to take off his shirt.

246
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,770
Why have you been taking
your shirt off lately?

247
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,112
- Because I needed to.

248
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:18,029
- [Ellie] Because you needed to?

249
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:19,878
Why, were you too hot?

250
00:07:19,878 --> 00:07:20,781
- Yes.

251
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:22,162
- [Ellie] Wow.

252
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:24,432
- [Jared] Well sometimes
Mommy is a little cold,

253
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:26,505
and you know what we do when Mommy's cold?

254
00:07:26,505 --> 00:07:27,583
I'll show ya.
- What?

255
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,416
(beeping)

256
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,305
- [Ellie] Yeah, I turned that
bad boy on this morning too.

257
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:33,882
You look like a big boy
with your little underwear

258
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:36,689
sticking out and your shirt off.

259
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,257
Welcome to the family Leo.

260
00:07:39,257 --> 00:07:41,527
- We got a new puppy!

261
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,630
- [Ellie] Aren't you so cute?

262
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,528
- Is he like our puppy?
- Look at this.

263
00:07:45,528 --> 00:07:47,516
- [Ellie] It's not quite ours,
but they said we can use him

264
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:49,095
whenever we want.

265
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:49,928
Use him as in play.

266
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:50,761
(laughing)

267
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:52,978
- [Jared] Use him for
titles and thumbnails.

268
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:54,640
- Hi Dallen, you guys have
seen Dallen so many times.

269
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,896
He has helped us film some of our

270
00:07:56,896 --> 00:07:58,792
really big, fun videos.
- Best videos.

271
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,143
- And he has his girlfriend here,

272
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:01,976
hi pretty girl.

273
00:08:01,976 --> 00:08:02,897
- Hi.

274
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:04,666
- [Ellie] Hi Leo.

275
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:06,563
But this is the one we're
focusing on the most.

276
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:07,464
So cute.

277
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:08,795
- [Jared] Let's get a family picture.

278
00:08:08,795 --> 00:08:10,618
Aww how sweet.
- One two three cheese.

279
00:08:10,618 --> 00:08:12,302
- [Ellie] Cheese, cheese.

280
00:08:12,302 --> 00:08:13,446
This is so fun.

281
00:08:13,446 --> 00:08:14,409
- This is fun.

282
00:08:14,409 --> 00:08:15,584
Date night.
- So if you don't know

283
00:08:15,584 --> 00:08:17,194
- Dallen and I are longtime friends.

284
00:08:17,194 --> 00:08:19,162
And we're having dinner together.

285
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:20,711
So this is a lot of fun.
- Thai food.

286
00:08:20,711 --> 00:08:22,076
- Usually we're working together.

287
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,295
- Yeah, now we're just relaxing.

288
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,389
- Yeah, we're enjoying
each other's company now.

289
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:25,222
- [Ellie] Calvin.

290
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:27,087
- Look who just wok up.

291
00:08:27,087 --> 00:08:28,394
- [Ellie] Do you want
to go see that puppy?

292
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:29,790
- Do you want to see a puppy?

293
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,029
- [Ellie] Go look at the puppy.

294
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,061
- [Jared] Mom has the puppy.

295
00:08:33,061 --> 00:08:34,894
- I got it right here.

296
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:36,668
He's licking his face.

297
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:38,315
(laughing)

298
00:08:38,315 --> 00:08:39,148
Look at the puppy,

299
00:08:39,148 --> 00:08:40,538
He's like I just woke up.

300
00:08:40,538 --> 00:08:41,922
- It's a puppy.

301
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:43,498
He wants to say hi.

302
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:45,082
- [Ellie] He is so happy.

303
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:45,915
- Hi.

304
00:08:45,915 --> 00:08:47,430
(barks)

305
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,421
He is so tired still.

306
00:08:49,421 --> 00:08:51,502
- Do you want to see the
puppy, okay goodnight.

307
00:08:51,502 --> 00:08:52,749
- Okay, should we go back to bed?

308
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:53,582
- Uh-uh.

309
00:08:53,582 --> 00:08:55,708
- Oh you want to stay up now?

310
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,093
- Isn't he so cute guys?

311
00:08:58,093 --> 00:08:59,991
- He likes you.
- Oh he likes that.

312
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,019
- [Ellie] Look at that.

313
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:01,852
What a fun treat.

314
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:04,631
I want to wake up everyday
to a puppy in my face.

315
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:05,464
I do.

316
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:07,918
She's 60 pounds.

317
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,367
(laughing)

318
00:09:09,367 --> 00:09:12,806
- Do you remember when we got bad news

319
00:09:12,806 --> 00:09:15,136
about Jackson and all of your co-workers

320
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:16,830
brought puppies over to our house?

321
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,709
- [Ellie] It was Calvin, yes yes.

322
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:19,038
- Was it Calvin?

323
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:20,543
It was Calvin.

324
00:09:20,543 --> 00:09:21,642
- [Ellie] Yeah I was five weeks with him.

325
00:09:21,642 --> 00:09:24,702
And all my co-workers
brought puppies over.

326
00:09:24,702 --> 00:09:26,839
- Puppies over to make her feel better.

327
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:28,092
- It was the best.
- Like seven puppies.

328
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:29,142
- It was the best.

329
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:29,975
- [Woman] That's so cute.

330
00:09:29,975 --> 00:09:30,808
- [Dallen] That's the coolest
thing I've ever heard.

331
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:32,335
- [Ellie] It was really sweet.

332
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:33,301
Her dog had just had a puppy.
- I'll have a link

333
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,270
to that video in the iCard.

334
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:38,507
- [Dallen] And now I'm
gonna get you another one.

335
00:09:38,507 --> 00:09:40,456
- Jared said you pet the puppy

336
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,278
before you eat the licorice
standing right there.

337
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,195
- He's a good dog, huh?

338
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:50,515
Did he lick you?

339
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,739
- [Ellie] Did it look like a rug?

340
00:09:54,739 --> 00:09:55,682
- Yeah.

341
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:56,515
(laughing)

342
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:57,673
- [Ellie] Calvin has definitely warmed up,

343
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:59,498
won't leave the dog alone.

344
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:01,705
You like that little puppy?

345
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:02,908
He's not like Penny.

346
00:10:02,908 --> 00:10:05,564
Penny likes to like romp around.

347
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:08,036
He's just new, so he
sleeps still all the time.

348
00:10:08,036 --> 00:10:08,869
- Calvin.

349
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:12,851
Did you wake up to a new puppy?

350
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,101
(laughing)

351
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:21,551
that's the best way to
wake up every night, huh?

352
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,748
- [Ellie] I would like
to wake up to a puppy.

353
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,018
- I think everyone in the world

354
00:10:25,018 --> 00:10:27,687
would like to wake up to a new puppy.

355
00:10:27,687 --> 00:10:28,760
- [Ellie] Say goodbye to the puppy.

356
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,593
- Okay bye bye.

357
00:10:29,593 --> 00:10:30,426
- [Ellie] Kisses.

358
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:31,259
- Oh.

359
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:33,509
(laughing)

360
00:10:34,406 --> 00:10:35,747
- [Ellie] Are you whispering in his ear?

361
00:10:35,747 --> 00:10:36,580
Whisper.

362
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,960
- Tell the puppy a secret.

363
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,254
- [Ellie] Tell him a secret.

364
00:10:39,254 --> 00:10:41,162
- Tell him something.

365
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,842
(laughing)

366
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,945
- [Ellie] And Miss Penny
and the new little puppy.

367
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:51,386
- They're just different
sizes, that's all.

368
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:52,262
- [Ellie] They're different sizes.

369
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:55,753
We tried to do a little introduction and

370
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:57,984
the little puppy was very nervous.

371
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:58,817
You would've been good,

372
00:10:58,817 --> 00:11:00,661
but she was just nervous
because you're so big.

373
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:01,911
- You were just so excited.
- She is big.

374
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,599
- Penny is almost a year old

375
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,487
and she is 60 pounds.

376
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:08,673
- Yeah, probably 60 pounds by now.

377
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:10,507
Good girl, you're such a big girl.

378
00:11:10,507 --> 00:11:12,419
You're a good girl, huh?

379
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:14,120
Let me rub you again,
let me rub you again.

380
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,237
(laughing)

381
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:18,224
(Jared yells)

382
00:11:18,224 --> 00:11:20,944
(groans)

383
00:11:20,944 --> 00:11:23,217
- Why is it always me?

384
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,889
- [Ellie] Now she's excited.

385
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,346
- She's doing zoomies.

386
00:11:27,346 --> 00:11:29,013
She's doing zoomies.

387
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,695
(laughing)

388
00:11:31,695 --> 00:11:34,516
- [Ellie] She is, Penny girl.

389
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:35,778
She's acting.

390
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,028
(laughing)

391
00:11:39,005 --> 00:11:40,172
She's excited.

392
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:42,095
Penny.

393
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,550
Look at her.

394
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,383
(yelling)

395
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:47,216
(signal tone)

396
00:11:47,216 --> 00:11:48,049
- [Jared] Okay.

397
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:49,295
What was that all about?

398
00:11:49,295 --> 00:11:50,128
- Down.
- Huh?

399
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:50,961
- [Ellie] Down.

400
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:51,794
- Down.

401
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,794
Penny, down.

402
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,863
Good girl.

403
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:57,312
- She was totally excited.

404
00:11:57,312 --> 00:11:59,431
- [Jared] She was doing zoomies.

405
00:11:59,431 --> 00:12:00,264
- Down.

406
00:12:00,264 --> 00:12:01,143
Oh my gosh.
- Down.

407
00:12:01,143 --> 00:12:02,587
- [Jared] Down.

408
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:03,822
- Good girl.
- Good girl.

409
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:04,655
- That was hilarious.

410
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:05,972
- [Jared] And intense.

411
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:07,140
- She knew we were laughing.

412
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,600
Like she knew that that was funny.

413
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,433
- I'm sorry to tell you,

414
00:12:10,433 --> 00:12:11,379
but I'm not sure if we'll be able

415
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:12,755
to have any more kids after that.

416
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,907
She got me right where it counts.

417
00:12:14,907 --> 00:12:15,994
- That's not funny.

418
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,579
- I know it's not funny,
it hurt really bad.

419
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,215
- [Ellie] Jared always
gets hit in the crotch.

420
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,270
- It's like a family joke.

421
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,870
It always happens to me

422
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,503
and it's the worst.

423
00:12:23,503 --> 00:12:25,753
(laughing)

424
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,515
I'm sitting here in my office,

425
00:12:30,515 --> 00:12:32,670
just holding back the tears right now.

426
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,654
I'm watching America's Got Talent

427
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,660
and Evie Clair is singing right now.

428
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,092
If you guys remember from CVX Live,

429
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,245
we were lucky enough to meet her.

430
00:12:42,245 --> 00:12:43,346
She was one of the talent there

431
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,834
at CVX and she's just the sweetest.

432
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,906
And so she's singing
in the finals right now

433
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:48,874
and if you guys didn't know,

434
00:12:48,874 --> 00:12:50,602
her dad passed away last week

435
00:12:50,602 --> 00:12:52,423
and just like holy cow,

436
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,593
I can't even imagine
what she's going through

437
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:56,530
right now, but she's up there on stage,

438
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,881
and it's very sweet to see her do that,

439
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:01,576
because she's doing such
a great job right now,

440
00:13:01,576 --> 00:13:02,527
it's incredible.

441
00:13:02,527 --> 00:13:04,283
But Evie, we're thinking about you

442
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,818
and your family right now

443
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,785
and hope you guys are doing okay.

444
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,697
Gosh that was good.

445
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:11,546
We've said this a lot
in the past few days,

446
00:13:11,546 --> 00:13:13,882
there's so much going
on in the world today

447
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:15,330
and so many troublesome things

448
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,875
so many natural disasters,

449
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,037
so many hard things that
people are going through

450
00:13:20,037 --> 00:13:22,036
right now and we just want to let you know

451
00:13:22,036 --> 00:13:23,063
that we are thinking of you

452
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:24,352
and we're praying for you in each

453
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:25,536
of your situations.

454
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,460
We hope that you're doing good.

455
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,309
So with that, it's time to end the night.

456
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:31,652
So thank you for watching.

457
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,756
We appreciate you.

458
00:13:32,756 --> 00:13:34,091
We're grateful for your support.

459
00:13:34,091 --> 00:00:00,000
And we will see you
guys tomorrow, bye bye.
