1
00:00:00,397 --> 00:00:02,980
(somber music)

2
00:00:06,698 --> 00:00:10,865
- Today is August 11th, 2017,
and we have something exciting

3
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:14,237
that we wanna share with you.

4
00:00:14,237 --> 00:00:17,153
Ellie, why don't you
tell us what that says?

5
00:00:17,153 --> 00:00:20,520
- It says we're pregnant!
- We're pregnant!

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,733
- We are very excited.

7
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:25,943
Jared and I are having a baby.

8
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,925
For all of you that have
followed Jared and I,

9
00:00:27,925 --> 00:00:31,461
you know that we've been
trying to have a baby,

10
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:34,709
and we had a miscarriage a few months ago,

11
00:00:34,709 --> 00:00:39,036
and I am very irregular,
and I've been keeping track,

12
00:00:39,036 --> 00:00:41,115
and I had a period on June 30th,

13
00:00:41,115 --> 00:00:43,448
and I ovulated on July 30th,

14
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:48,800
and that would leave me right
now 12 days past ovulation,

15
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,083
and it was just really
early to take a test.

16
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,099
A few days ago, I took a test,

17
00:00:55,099 --> 00:00:58,741
because I just felt a
little off, and I felt like

18
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:02,685
my boobs were a little
fuller, and we got a very,

19
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,544
very faint positive, and we're like,

20
00:01:05,544 --> 00:01:07,048
"Oh my gosh, that's crazy".

21
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:10,674
You can barely see it, and
then, yesterday, we took a test,

22
00:01:10,674 --> 00:01:13,132
and you can definitely see the line there,

23
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:16,815
and, today, 12 days past
ovulation, I got a positive

24
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:20,562
pregnancy test again.
- Oh my goodness.

25
00:01:20,562 --> 00:01:22,570
Oh my goodness.

26
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,138
- Jared and I are very excited.

27
00:01:24,138 --> 00:01:26,577
Here, in a few days, we have
our first doctor appointment,

28
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:30,651
and, in four weeks, we
have our first ultrasound.

29
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:33,612
We'll keep you updated
day by day as I'm feeling,

30
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,279
and what's going on.

31
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:39,245
Well, good morning, family.

32
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:41,023
Today is the day.

33
00:01:41,023 --> 00:01:43,439
We have an ultrasound today.

34
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,370
- I'm so excited.

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,882
- I'm gonna order pancakes!

36
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:48,429
- And we are going to go to
breakfast with the family.

37
00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:50,813
I thought that would be fun
to start our morning off.

38
00:01:50,813 --> 00:01:51,646
We're gonna have breakfast.

39
00:01:51,646 --> 00:01:52,479
- [Jackson] I wanna order pancakes!

40
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,386
- We're gonna order pancakes,
and then we are gonna go

41
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:55,872
to my ultrasound.

42
00:01:55,872 --> 00:01:57,366
- To your ultrasound!

43
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:58,670
- I'm very excited.

44
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:02,477
Have a little bit of nerves,
but I'm very excited.

45
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:06,994
We have been on cloud 10 for
days, and I keep taking a test,

46
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:09,330
'cause I just don't
believe it, and, every time

47
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,416
it shows up positive, I
just can't even believe it.

48
00:02:12,416 --> 00:02:13,577
- It's been exciting.

49
00:02:13,577 --> 00:02:14,502
It's so great.

50
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:17,644
- And, with that, I don't sleep,

51
00:02:17,644 --> 00:02:18,993
and I think it's just 'cause I'm excited.

52
00:02:18,993 --> 00:02:21,054
I wake up all night just
like, "I can't believe this".

53
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:24,258
This is so unreal, and
my eyes are tired, and--

54
00:02:24,258 --> 00:02:25,859
- Every night, when we
go to bed, Ellie's like,

55
00:02:25,859 --> 00:02:27,155
"Can you even believe this".

56
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,523
Isn't this crazy?

57
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:32,338
- I am so happy, and I
am looking like crazy

58
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,228
on Pinterest right now.

59
00:02:34,228 --> 00:02:37,484
I am showing Jared there's a
bunch of photos, of course,

60
00:02:37,484 --> 00:02:41,452
I wanna take while I'm
expecting, but look at this.

61
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:45,411
I think it'd be so pretty
to do something like this

62
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,284
where it's like a silhouette, you know,

63
00:02:48,284 --> 00:02:51,581
every few weeks or every
trimester or something.

64
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:54,164
(gentle music)

65
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:12,517
With every pregnancy, I
have got this massage bar

66
00:03:12,517 --> 00:03:16,600
for my tummy from Lush,
and the whole nine months

67
00:03:18,452 --> 00:03:21,624
it lasts me, and I rub
it on my belly every day

68
00:03:21,624 --> 00:03:23,429
and even, towards the end of the pregnancy

69
00:03:23,429 --> 00:03:28,183
when my belly is stretched
and tired and it hurts,

70
00:03:28,183 --> 00:03:30,379
I rub it on it more than once a day,

71
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:32,547
and it lasts the whole nine months.

72
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,130
I feel really good.

73
00:03:36,693 --> 00:03:38,738
I think I'm tired just because
I've been really excited,

74
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:42,634
and I haven't slept, but I
can tell around three o'clock,

75
00:03:42,634 --> 00:03:44,899
I'm just kind of done for the day.

76
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:47,982
My eyes are so tired, and I'm hungry.

77
00:03:49,202 --> 00:03:51,677
Right when I wake up, if I
do not eat, I'm just like,

78
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:54,404
"I need to eat, or I'm gonna be cranky".

79
00:03:54,404 --> 00:03:58,174
Those are just two things that
I definitely have noticed,

80
00:03:58,174 --> 00:04:01,265
but it still boggles my mind.

81
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,876
I take a test every morning,

82
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,883
because I just don't think that it's real,

83
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:08,300
and I just don't know what to do all day.

84
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,119
This is what my face just looks like.

85
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:12,119
I'm excited.

86
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,648
I am a little nervous.

87
00:04:14,648 --> 00:04:17,654
I think that, with every pregnancy,

88
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:18,928
I have been a little nervous.

89
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:22,327
It's always in the back
of my mind of what ifs,

90
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:24,571
and you just really
never know until you have

91
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:29,115
that healthy baby in your
arms, but I'm excited,

92
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,401
and I'm going to be excited right now,

93
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:35,225
and I am a little nervous for
our appointments coming up,

94
00:04:35,225 --> 00:04:39,436
but I'm just gonna try and
enjoy the moment as it's here,

95
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:43,603
and I hope and pray that
everything goes safe and good.

96
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:46,716
I have a really good
feeling, though, about it,

97
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,039
and I think that that says a lot for me

98
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,483
if I feel really good and at peace.

99
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:54,724
- My heart just starts pounding,

100
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:56,191
and my hearts starts racing,

101
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,378
and I get a little nervous,
and I can't even imagine

102
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:00,211
how you feel, Ellie.

103
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:01,177
- I have a lot of nerves right now.

104
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:05,585
(music drowns out speech)
- I do this, and it turns on.

105
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:06,418
- Okay.

106
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:10,904
I'm sitting here, and I
just got the house cleaned.

107
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:13,424
Everyone took naps today, feeling great,

108
00:05:13,424 --> 00:05:17,567
and I'm just going, looking
up Fall and Christmas decor,

109
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,080
'cause I am just kind of obsessed
thinking about Fall decor

110
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,942
right now, and I got a
phone call and a voicemail

111
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:27,285
from my doctor, so, when I called to go in

112
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,444
for my first appointment,
they just did blood work,

113
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:32,282
and I asked them if I
could get on Progesterone,

114
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:35,126
because, if you get on
Progesterone, from what I was told

115
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,966
having Jackson is it doesn't
hurt you just to get on it,

116
00:05:37,966 --> 00:05:40,912
'cause it just can help
prevent miscarriage

117
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:43,648
is what the fertility doctors had told me,

118
00:05:43,648 --> 00:05:46,922
and, with having a
miscarriage a few months ago,

119
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:48,955
calling in, I asked them.

120
00:05:48,955 --> 00:05:51,349
I said, "Can we, um,
get me on Progesterone,"

121
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:53,284
and she's like, "Well,
I talked to the doctor,

122
00:05:53,284 --> 00:05:55,219
"and we'll check your
levels, and, if they're low,

123
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,593
"then we'll give it to
you," and I just got a call

124
00:05:57,593 --> 00:06:01,337
from the doctor, which I love
when the doctor himself calls.

125
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:02,858
I'm gonna try not to get emotional,

126
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,358
but it just means a lot to me.

127
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:10,485
It just means a lot to me
when they personally call,

128
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:12,540
and he just left a
really heartfelt message,

129
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,626
and he said it's nothing to worry about,

130
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:19,604
but he said that my Progesterone
is a little borderline,

131
00:06:19,604 --> 00:06:22,060
and he said hopefully that makes sense.

132
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,002
I'm like, (laughs) I think I get it,

133
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:26,784
but it was kinda funny how he said it.

134
00:06:26,784 --> 00:06:29,015
Anyway, so they called
me in a prescription,

135
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:31,177
so, Jared, I was like, "Run".

136
00:06:31,177 --> 00:06:34,844
My heart just sank, and
I'm just like, "No".

137
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,773
He's gonna go get me some Progesterone,

138
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:40,115
and I'm gonna be on that
until the first trimester

139
00:06:40,115 --> 00:06:42,424
is over with to give me a little boost,

140
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:46,591
and I'm really hoping that
everything will be good.

141
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:49,773
You know, it's just always
in the back of your mind,

142
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:54,228
like scare and fear, and I've
really enjoyed the last week

143
00:06:54,228 --> 00:06:58,008
just kind of in our own element,
just Jared and I knowing

144
00:06:58,008 --> 00:07:01,426
and just enjoying it and
thinking about a pregnancy

145
00:07:01,426 --> 00:07:05,089
and just enjoying it
for myself for a minute,

146
00:07:05,089 --> 00:07:07,132
and that does worry me a little bit,

147
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:10,056
but I still feel really
good and really positive,

148
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:12,355
but it's just one of those
things along the way.

149
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,456
You know, you spot a little
bit, and you get really nervous

150
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:16,895
or your Progesterone's low,
and you get a little nervous,

151
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,784
which I think you should.

152
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:20,413
You know, it's like that's your baby,

153
00:07:20,413 --> 00:07:22,538
and you want everything to go smooth.

154
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:25,849
Jared is on his way to
go get the medicine,

155
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:28,899
and I'll keep you guys updated.

156
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,190
Hopefully, everything will
continue to go smooth.

157
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,612
- [Jared] This is it.

158
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,539
This is it, boys.

159
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,651
Look, when the doctor comes in, Jackson,

160
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:41,109
we'll be able to look up on this TV,

161
00:07:41,109 --> 00:07:44,672
and we're gonna see if we
can find the baby, okay?

162
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,978
- I can't see.

163
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:47,034
- [Jared] Is that exciting?

164
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,066
- [Jackson] I'm gonna move this chair.

165
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:51,632
- [Jared] Okay, do you
wanna see the TV better?

166
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:53,745
- We just had the cutest moment.

167
00:07:53,745 --> 00:07:55,405
Jared and I--
- Oh, so sweet.

168
00:07:55,405 --> 00:07:57,890
- Were not gonna tell Jackson yet.

169
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,029
We were gonna wait until
we have our ultrasound,

170
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:00,862
and we were gonna--

171
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:01,830
- And show him the picture and everything.

172
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,206
- Yeah, or bring him with us,

173
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:05,886
and I just went to the bathroom,

174
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:08,765
and I was like looking at my
tummy, and I was showing Jared,

175
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,683
and, Jackson, did you
find something out tonight

176
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,726
about my tummy?

177
00:08:13,726 --> 00:08:15,758
- Yeah, a baby.

178
00:08:15,758 --> 00:08:17,550
- [Ellie] And you said,
"Mom, is there a baby

179
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,523
"in your tummy".

180
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:19,357
- Yeah.

181
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,878
- [Jared] And what is the baby doing?

182
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:21,958
- Growing.

183
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,207
- [Ellie] Yeah, and you
found out tonight, huh?

184
00:08:25,207 --> 00:08:26,871
- You figured it out, and that's the thing

185
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:27,753
is he figured it out.

186
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:28,586
- [Ellie] It's funny.

187
00:08:28,586 --> 00:08:30,272
- Ellie was just like,
"Jared, look at my tummy,"

188
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,557
and he says, "Is there
a baby in your tummy".

189
00:08:32,557 --> 00:08:35,438
It was the cutest thing in the world.

190
00:08:35,438 --> 00:08:37,561
- [Ellie] You can tell
your brother tomorrow, huh?

191
00:08:37,561 --> 00:08:39,028
- [Jared] Should you tell Calvin?

192
00:08:39,028 --> 00:08:40,052
- Yes.

193
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,125
- [Ellie] And I asked you
do you think we'll have

194
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,763
a brother or a sister?

195
00:08:42,763 --> 00:08:43,850
- A brother.

196
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,683
- [Ellie] Brother.

197
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:47,765
K, that changed from two
seconds ago, so we'll see.

198
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:49,566
- [Jared] He said sister before.

199
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:52,172
- [Ellie] K, it's time for bed.

200
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:53,757
- [Jared] K, do you guys have your spot?

201
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:56,503
You guys ready to see
when the doctor comes in?

202
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,391
(laughs)

203
00:08:58,391 --> 00:08:59,308
- Sit here.

204
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,081
I sit here.

205
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,412
- I am getting ready to
go out for the night,

206
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:06,048
and I am nervous.

207
00:09:06,048 --> 00:09:07,525
I'm nervous, 'cause I'm worried that

208
00:09:07,525 --> 00:09:09,819
I'm gonna be sick driving home.

209
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:12,652
I have been very sick at night.

210
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,003
I don't have morning sickness.

211
00:09:14,003 --> 00:09:17,161
I totally have night sickness,
which is so weird for me,

212
00:09:17,161 --> 00:09:19,889
because I've never really had sickness

213
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:20,797
when I've been pregnant.

214
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,118
Of course, there's been a
few days where it's like

215
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:24,341
I don't feel good and
maybe a little nausea,

216
00:09:24,341 --> 00:09:26,708
but I've never been like,
"I need to lay down.

217
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,517
"I'm nauseated," you know,
but the last few nights

218
00:09:29,517 --> 00:09:31,197
have been so bad.

219
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:33,447
Last night was so, so bad.

220
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,032
I had Jared put a bowl next to my bed

221
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:37,541
just in case I woke up
and needed to throw up,

222
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,017
and tonight I'm going out, and we'll see.

223
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,915
Hopefully, I can make it home okay.

224
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,498
(gentle music)

225
00:09:56,811 --> 00:09:58,674
- It's okay, baby.

226
00:09:58,674 --> 00:09:59,951
It's okay, baby.

227
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,637
- [Ellie] Are you saying,
"It's okay, baby"?

228
00:10:01,637 --> 00:10:02,825
- Okay, baby!

229
00:10:02,825 --> 00:10:04,694
- Jackson is saying, "It's okay, baby,"

230
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,557
'cause I was pushing him,
and he was pretending

231
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:09,427
to kick me, and I'd go aw, and he'd laugh,

232
00:10:09,427 --> 00:10:11,983
and then, after a minute, he
goes, "Where's your baby,"

233
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:13,655
and I said, "In my tummy," and he said,

234
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,994
"I don't wanna hurt the
baby," so now he's saying.

235
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:18,318
What are you saying?

236
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:19,334
- It's okay, baby.

237
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,530
- It's okay, baby.

238
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,970
- It's okay, baby.

239
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,680
- [Ellie] And then you
stopped pretending to kick

240
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,980
so you wouldn't kick the baby.

241
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,897
I thought that was so sweet of you.

242
00:10:30,654 --> 00:10:31,489
- [Jared] You ready for this?

243
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:32,322
- Yes.

244
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,638
- [Doctor] All right, only
been waiting five days.

245
00:10:33,638 --> 00:10:36,404
- Hopefully I'm far
along to see on this one.

246
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:37,717
- [Jared] The external, yeah.

247
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:41,212
- I'm eight weeks and four days, I think.

248
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:42,045
- [Jared] K.

249
00:10:42,045 --> 00:10:43,371
- [Doctor] I'm about to
say we can't see from above

250
00:10:43,371 --> 00:10:45,373
when you're teeny tiny.

251
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:47,177
- Yeah, push hard.

252
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:48,771
- [Jared] Look up at the TV, k.

253
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:50,438
Look up right there.

254
00:10:53,665 --> 00:10:55,731
- [Doctor] Yeah, it looks
like it's too little.

255
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:56,571
- [Jackson] Where's the baby?

256
00:10:56,571 --> 00:10:57,949
- [Ellie] Dang it.

257
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,926
- [Jared] Too little, k.

258
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,716
- [Doctor] Here's the gray part.

259
00:11:01,716 --> 00:11:02,851
- [Ellie] Yes, that's the baby.

260
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:03,966
- [Doctor] There's the sac.

261
00:11:03,966 --> 00:11:04,799
- [Ellie] Okay.

262
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:05,753
- [Doctor] And I just can't see it now.

263
00:11:05,753 --> 00:11:06,866
- [Jackson] Dad, where's the baby?

264
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,828
- [Jared] We might have to
use a different ultrasound

265
00:11:08,828 --> 00:11:10,248
to see the baby.

266
00:11:10,248 --> 00:11:11,994
(mumbles)

267
00:11:11,994 --> 00:11:14,387
- [Doctor] I never would
say to look in the vaginal.

268
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,771
I have a little concern
right, like, to me,

269
00:11:16,771 --> 00:11:19,873
that's a little bit irregular.

270
00:11:19,873 --> 00:11:21,073
- What does that mean?

271
00:11:21,073 --> 00:11:22,549
- [Doctor] Not as big as it should be.

272
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,796
- And this is why I was
nervous to have the kids come

273
00:11:25,796 --> 00:11:27,063
if something didn't go right,

274
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:28,849
'cause he was just like, "What".

275
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:30,003
- [Jared] Where's the baby?

276
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:31,294
- Jackson, we're gonna make sure

277
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:33,755
that there is a healthy baby.

278
00:11:33,755 --> 00:11:36,293
- I think he's basing it off
of their measurements, not--

279
00:11:36,293 --> 00:11:37,126
- [Ellie] Ours.

280
00:11:37,126 --> 00:11:38,598
- Ours, so I think two
weeks is a big difference

281
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:40,383
when this baby's that little.

282
00:11:40,383 --> 00:11:45,236
I know you didn't want to, but
we've gotta go the other way.

283
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:48,244
- [Ellie] I have a little anxiety.

284
00:11:48,244 --> 00:11:49,965
What's that big gray on the left?

285
00:11:49,965 --> 00:11:50,798
- [Doctor] This right here?

286
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:51,631
- [Ellie] Yeah.

287
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:54,042
- [Doctor] Is a little
cyst on your right ovary.

288
00:11:54,042 --> 00:11:56,985
That's probably a little bit of blood.

289
00:11:56,985 --> 00:11:58,458
This is the sac.

290
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,291
- [Jackson] Baby.

291
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,541
(whispers)

292
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:06,816
- It grows probably to the
point three weeks, four weeks--

293
00:12:06,816 --> 00:12:07,861
- And then stops.

294
00:12:07,861 --> 00:12:11,981
- Then it stops, but, if it
forms on a separate organ,

295
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,792
then it keeps going.

296
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,102
The sac grows, but it's empty.

297
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:20,216
It's not really empty. (audio distortion)

298
00:12:20,216 --> 00:12:22,799
(somber music)

299
00:12:36,072 --> 00:12:38,069
- As you guys can probably
tell from the video,

300
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:42,236
the baby stopped growing,
and we are going to miscarry,

301
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:46,950
but we had one, exactly one month

302
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:50,033
of the most enjoyable month together.

303
00:12:51,629 --> 00:12:53,022
We had this--
- Yes.

304
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,867
- To ourselves, and we've
never done that before,

305
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,557
and it was special, and it was nice,

306
00:12:58,557 --> 00:13:00,151
and we really enjoyed it.

307
00:13:00,151 --> 00:13:01,462
- Jared summed it up perfect.

308
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:03,758
He was like, "This month has been bliss,"

309
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:07,925
and I am so glad that we
continued to document it though,

310
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,734
and I have so many cute pictures

311
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,833
of my itty bitty teeny belly.

312
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,583
I gained four pounds,

313
00:13:20,271 --> 00:13:24,390
and this was a fun month,
and we, in our Q&A,

314
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,245
I had said Jared and I, with
us filming for four years,

315
00:13:28,245 --> 00:13:30,565
we're learning what to do and not to do,

316
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:34,398
and, especially when it
comes to raw emotions,

317
00:13:35,603 --> 00:13:39,770
it's very important that
we keep things and enjoy it

318
00:13:41,368 --> 00:13:44,451
and grieve and do that on our timing,

319
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:50,987
and we've been open to
each other and to you guys

320
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,114
that, if good and bad, we would announce,

321
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:57,108
and today we were gonna
announce good or bad,

322
00:13:57,108 --> 00:14:00,858
and, unfortunately, it
doesn't end very well,

323
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:05,449
but we did have a wonderful month.

324
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:06,376
- We really did,

325
00:14:06,376 --> 00:14:09,200
There's trials in life, and
we go through these trials,

326
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,180
and I've always said the
trials you go through

327
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,013
don't define you.

328
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:13,473
It's how you overcome those trials,

329
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,853
and we're gonna keep going forward,

330
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,009
and we are going to feel the sad emotion.

331
00:14:18,009 --> 00:14:18,936
- Oh, yes.

332
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:21,384
- We are going to feel
that, and we are going to go

333
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:23,678
through this process,
but that doesn't mean

334
00:14:23,678 --> 00:14:27,062
we're not gonna keep our chins
up and our heads forward.

335
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:30,743
Ellie tweeted the other day
having a positive attitude

336
00:14:30,743 --> 00:14:32,634
doesn't mean that you can't be sad,

337
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:35,097
but it's being able to
recognize that there's gonna be

338
00:14:35,097 --> 00:14:36,527
better days ahead.

339
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:38,129
- Well, and just because you're positive

340
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,074
doesn't mean you're always happy.

341
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:42,394
We're just looking at a bright side,

342
00:14:42,394 --> 00:14:45,337
and tomorrow's a new day,
but I am gonna allow myself

343
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:47,542
to be sad and grieve--
- Absolutely.

344
00:14:47,542 --> 00:14:49,342
- And I do have two
beautiful, healthy boys,

345
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:51,087
and I did get pregnant on my own,

346
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:54,452
and that all alone, in and
of itself, is a blessing,

347
00:14:54,452 --> 00:14:56,918
and I see that, but
I'm still gonna grieve,

348
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:59,735
and I'm gonna be very sad, and I am sad,

349
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:01,823
and it was amazing.

350
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:04,585
I took so many tests this month.

351
00:15:04,585 --> 00:15:06,366
- [Jared] All of those are positive.

352
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:09,731
- So many tests this
month, and it was amazing,

353
00:15:09,731 --> 00:15:11,342
and I took one just two weeks ago

354
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,592
just 'cause I couldn't even believe it.

355
00:15:15,516 --> 00:15:19,655
I think I'm mostly sad 'cause of Jackson.

356
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:21,591
We weren't gonna tell him.

357
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,850
- He figured it out.

358
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,991
- And it's kinda hard not
to, and he did figure it out,

359
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,790
and he's been the cutest to me.

360
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,983
- Always asking about how's the baby,

361
00:15:30,983 --> 00:15:33,512
and it was just really sweet.
- He was very tender.

362
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:35,753
- And it just goes to show
what kind of person he is,

363
00:15:35,753 --> 00:15:39,920
and we are so, so grateful
for Jackson and Calvin.

364
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:44,968
We are so grateful for them
and the love that we have

365
00:15:44,968 --> 00:15:47,863
for them and the love they have for us.

366
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,236
I mean, we're grateful for them.

367
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:50,748
- Oh yeah, we just stared at them today

368
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,421
and just stared all day, and we're like,

369
00:15:53,421 --> 00:15:57,093
"What should we do?
Whatever you want, kids".

370
00:15:57,093 --> 00:16:00,218
It was a day to spend with family,

371
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:03,055
but we're gonna go ahead and
say goodnight to you guys.

372
00:16:03,055 --> 00:16:04,871
I thoroughly enjoyed all my conversations

373
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,031
with our family today.

374
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,830
I'm so grateful that we
have them to lean on.

375
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,663
- Absolutely.

376
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:13,750
- Thank you guys for
supporting us and coming along

377
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,543
this crazy life, and I know
a lot of you have experienced

378
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,210
this too, and we're just sharing

379
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:24,651
our little bits of journey,
so thank you for watching.

380
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,249
- And we'll see you guys next time.

381
00:16:26,249 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
