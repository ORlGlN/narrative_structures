1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,423
- Are you ready to celebrate?
(bright music)

2
00:00:02,423 --> 00:00:03,289
- Yeah.

3
00:00:03,289 --> 00:00:05,303
- [Jared] Do you think this
is a getaway or something?

4
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:06,299
Wait wait wait wait!

5
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,132
We gotta finish the song.

6
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:08,633
Did you miss your babies?
- I feel sorry I

7
00:00:08,633 --> 00:00:09,599
(Calvin growling)

8
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,269
- [Jackson] Yay!

9
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,060
(bright music)

10
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,568
Run run, the floor is lava!

11
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:17,494
- Oh runaway, run run run!

12
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:19,911
The floor is lava guys, ahhh!

13
00:00:20,943 --> 00:00:22,026
Hup, ah okay,

14
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:24,039
I found this plane.

15
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:25,707
Guy's you're on the ground,
you gotta step on something,

16
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:27,610
the floor is lava.

17
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,534
Oh there we go.

18
00:00:28,534 --> 00:00:31,086
Calvin hurry, hurry the floor's lava.

19
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:32,293
- It's coming up!

20
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:33,775
- It's coming up, hurry.

21
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,553
Ah run away!

22
00:00:35,553 --> 00:00:36,553
Oh good job.

23
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,603
(laughs) Good job.

24
00:00:38,603 --> 00:00:39,954
Come on over here Calvin.

25
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:40,944
Jump.

26
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:42,032
Woo!

27
00:00:42,032 --> 00:00:43,569
Good morning guys.

28
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:44,993
Hope you're having an awesome day.

29
00:00:44,993 --> 00:00:47,846
We've got some fun, exciting
things planned for today.

30
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:50,086
For us, it is the day before Thanksgiving,

31
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:51,596
which means that we are going to be doing

32
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:54,482
one of my favorite family
traditions later tonight.

33
00:00:54,482 --> 00:00:55,315
It's so exciting!

34
00:00:55,315 --> 00:00:59,065
And also, today is the
one year anniversary

35
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:00,465
that we have had Penny

36
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,377
as a part of our family.

37
00:01:02,377 --> 00:01:04,281
So we're going to celebrate!

38
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:05,583
You ready to celebrate?

39
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:06,416
(Calvin hums)

40
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:07,249
- [Jackson] The floor's lava!

41
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,082
(Jared laughs)

42
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:09,336
- Are you ready to celebrate?

43
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:10,545
- Yeah!

44
00:01:10,545 --> 00:01:11,832
- Do you have something to tell me today?

45
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:12,665
- Yeah.

46
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:15,410
- What are you gonna tell me?

47
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,580
- Are we gonna go to Grandma's house

48
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,880
and pick up Penny some birthday stuff?

49
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,313
- That's right, that's so funny.

50
00:01:23,313 --> 00:01:25,896
Also, did you dress yourself this morning?

51
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:26,729
- Yeah.

52
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:27,696
- You picked out your clothes

53
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:28,782
and you dressed yourself?

54
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:29,615
- Yeah.

55
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:31,355
- That is so cool.

56
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:32,856
Wait, hold on, hold on.

57
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,029
And your shirt is right side forward.

58
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,029
Good job, high five bud.

59
00:01:37,952 --> 00:01:40,752
Like the thing is that it's
not cool that Jackson dresses,

60
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,743
it is cool that Jackson dresses himself,

61
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:44,239
don't get me wrong, it is cool.

62
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,119
But it's cool that he picks stuff

63
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,839
that looks decent, it looks great.

64
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,670
I couldn't do that for him.

65
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,911
I would pick something totally different

66
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,231
that looks weird.

67
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:54,581
But show me your socks.

68
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,617
What socks are you wearing?

69
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,449
Ooh your trampoline socks?

70
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,483
You like those ones, huh?

71
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:02,282
We need a, we need to wipe your face.

72
00:02:02,282 --> 00:02:03,595
That's one thing we've got to work on.

73
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:06,445
Oh, you've got a marker there.

74
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:07,434
(Jared laughs)

75
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:08,722
Your face.

76
00:02:08,722 --> 00:02:09,716
You're so funny.

77
00:02:09,716 --> 00:02:10,711
Did Daddy dress you today?

78
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,545
Yeah?

79
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,290
Because I wanted you to have elbow pads,

80
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,684
'cause elbow pads are
the coolest thing ever.

81
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:16,517
- The lava!

82
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:17,766
It just popped.

83
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:20,078
- [Jared] Oh, the floor's lava?

84
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:20,911
- Yeah.

85
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:22,235
- Okay we gotta find a place,

86
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:23,618
let's go, we gotta find a place to get up,

87
00:02:23,618 --> 00:02:25,156
higher ground, let's move.

88
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:26,610
Move move move.

89
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:27,975
- Oh I know a higher ground.

90
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:29,495
- [Jared] Okay.

91
00:02:29,495 --> 00:02:31,721
Hup hup, come on Calvin.

92
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:33,243
Oh good, I think we're safe now.

93
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:34,786
Thank goodness.
- Yeah.

94
00:02:34,786 --> 00:02:36,033
- Oh.
- Ooph.

95
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:36,866
- We finished getting ready.

96
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,821
The boys here are done.

97
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:39,042
You guys look fantastic.

98
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:41,115
And we are on our way to PetSmart.

99
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:42,032
We're gonna grab a couple things.

100
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:45,534
- We're going to see the fishies!

101
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:46,799
- Yeah we're gonna see the fishies

102
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,321
and we're gonna grab
some things for Penny.

103
00:02:48,321 --> 00:02:50,031
What do you think Penny needs?
- We made it, Dad!

104
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:50,864
- [Jackson] Dad, we made it!

105
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:51,898
- We made it.

106
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:53,781
What do you think Penny needs Jackson?

107
00:02:53,781 --> 00:02:55,020
- Birthday stuff.

108
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,343
- Birthday stuff.

109
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,993
I hope they have some things,

110
00:02:57,993 --> 00:02:59,601
because we want to make
this big for Penny.

111
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:01,342
It's her first year anniversary with us.

112
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:02,262
Oh my goodness boys,

113
00:03:02,262 --> 00:03:03,630
I think we hit the Jackpot.

114
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,607
What do you see?

115
00:03:05,607 --> 00:03:06,469
- Birthday cakes.

116
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:09,258
- Yeah, look at all of this stuff.

117
00:03:09,258 --> 00:03:10,386
- I wanna get this one, this yummy one.

118
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,729
- [Jared] That looks so cool.

119
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,137
- Look at the donut one.

120
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:17,009
- [Jared] I think Penny
would love this stuff,

121
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:18,457
birthday boy,

122
00:03:18,457 --> 00:03:19,661
happy birthday.

123
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,328
- It says happy birthday to you.

124
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:25,750
- [Jared] That's right.

125
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,063
What does yours say?

126
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:27,946
- A dog dog.

127
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:29,936
- A dog, yeah.
- Yeah.

128
00:03:29,936 --> 00:03:31,728
- Happy birthday to you.

129
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,576
- Well I think we should
grab one of these.

130
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,071
And maybe we'll get a couple more treats,

131
00:03:35,071 --> 00:03:37,298
and a couple toys, and
we should be all set.

132
00:03:37,298 --> 00:03:39,266
- Let's get Penny a ball.

133
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:40,647
- [Jared] You want to
get Penny a football?

134
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:41,480
- Yeah.

135
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,279
- [Jared] I think we can
find one, let's look.

136
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:44,760
Look, is this one okay?

137
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,593
- Yeah.

138
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:46,608
- [Jared] Does that one look good?

139
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:47,638
Look, it even squeaks.

140
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:48,471
(squeaking)

141
00:03:48,471 --> 00:03:50,612
I'm sure we're gonna regret that later.

142
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,479
(laughing)

143
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,979
Hey, where are you guys going?

144
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,143
You're crazy.

145
00:03:57,143 --> 00:03:59,154
You think this is a getaway or something?

146
00:03:59,154 --> 00:04:01,578
(laughing)

147
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:04,161
(Jared laughs)

148
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,167
Hey, I'm gonna get you.

149
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:10,844
Watch out.

150
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:13,149
Saved ya.

151
00:04:13,149 --> 00:04:15,135
- Why are we meeting up?

152
00:04:15,135 --> 00:04:18,038
- Well Mommy went down to
Grandma and Grandpa's house

153
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:21,197
to help make Thanksgiving dinner early,

154
00:04:21,197 --> 00:04:23,559
so they could to a photo
shoot for the cookbook.

155
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:25,576
So Mommy's at Grandma
Griffith's house right now.

156
00:04:25,576 --> 00:04:29,009
As soon as we're done
celebrating Penny's anniversary,

157
00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:30,728
I think that's what we're
calling it, anniversary,

158
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,833
we're gonna go and we're
gonna meet up with them.

159
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:34,504
And you're gonna play
with all your cousins

160
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:35,584
with your brand new football.

161
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:36,417
Does that sound fun?

162
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:37,250
- Yeah.

163
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,083
- Yeah.

164
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,613
Here is her little cake.

165
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,538
I have no idea what to expect from this.

166
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,729
Do you think it smells like
dog food or people food?

167
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:46,562
- Dog food.

168
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,395
- Let's see.

169
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,228
Oh wow.

170
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:50,884
What do you think it smells like?

171
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:51,875
- Dog food.

172
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,697
- It smells pretty good though, huh?

173
00:04:53,697 --> 00:04:55,391
Do you want to smell it Calvin?

174
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,224
- [Jackson] I'm gonna take it

175
00:04:56,224 --> 00:04:57,622
out for Penny.
- Smell it.

176
00:04:57,622 --> 00:05:00,607
- Oh don't eat it, just smell it silly.

177
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:01,938
(Jared laughs)

178
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:03,233
Okay.

179
00:05:03,233 --> 00:05:04,521
I've never done this before.

180
00:05:04,521 --> 00:05:06,449
We're gonna slice this up for Penny

181
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,106
and we'll see how this goes.

182
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:12,753
This might be worse
than one year old kids,

183
00:05:12,753 --> 00:05:14,786
the smash cake, you know the smash cake?

184
00:05:14,786 --> 00:05:15,809
We'll see how it goes.

185
00:05:15,809 --> 00:05:17,983
I've got her stuff set up.

186
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:19,245
(Jared laughs)

187
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,497
Oh my gosh.

188
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:22,978
Part of me can't believe I'm doing this,

189
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:25,113
but I think it's gonna be so much fun.

190
00:05:25,113 --> 00:05:26,221
Should we bring Penny inside?

191
00:05:26,221 --> 00:05:27,054
No no no no no, don't eat it.

192
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:27,887
That's for Penny.

193
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:28,982
Should we bring her inside?

194
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:29,815
- Yeah.

00:05:29,815 --> 00:05:31,617

Oh it's very crunchy.

It's not as soft as I thought it'd be.

00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:25,800
Oh yeah, is it good?

227

00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:34,295
Jackson wanted to get you a football.

231
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:35,128
Is that cool?

232
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,635
That's a fun little football.

233
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:38,142
- I got myself a football.

234
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:39,167
- Yeah.

235
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,590
Oh she's off playing with it already.

236
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,837
I may have gone a little
overboard, I don't know.

237
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,169
We got some fun stuff for her.

238
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,994
Some stuff for inside and for outside.

239
00:06:45,994 --> 00:06:47,217
And some treats.

240
00:06:47,217 --> 00:06:48,278
We're not doing of this at once,

241
00:06:48,278 --> 00:06:50,855
we've got some treats that
she's gonna have later on,

242
00:06:50,855 --> 00:06:52,915
but happy birthday Penny.

243
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:53,748
Happy anniversary.

244
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:54,581
I keep saying birthday,

245
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,537
just 'cause that's what I think of, but,

246
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:57,832
you are over one year old,

247
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:58,665
but you have been in our family

248
00:06:58,665 --> 00:06:59,654
- Dad Dad.

249
00:06:59,654 --> 00:07:00,487
Hurt.

250
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:01,320
- Aww.

251
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,685
- Happy birthday Penny.

252
00:07:02,685 --> 00:07:05,540
- Penny has been our
little furry ball of joy

253
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,628
for exactly one year.

254
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:11,187
- Last time, last time my birthday was on.

255
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:12,309
- [Jared] Yeah that's right.

256
00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:14,147
So we're so happy you're
in our family Penny.

257
00:07:14,147 --> 00:07:15,940
You bring us so much joy and happiness,

258
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,565
and dog poop,

259
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:18,851
that I have to pick up.

260
00:07:18,851 --> 00:07:19,684
(Jared laughs)

261
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:23,020
- She poops outside in the backyard.

262
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,211
- Yes she does.

263
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:26,516
Do you want to know something Penny?

264
00:07:26,516 --> 00:07:30,451
It was my dream as a
kid to have my own dog.

265
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:32,170
And I've got that now.

266
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,310
You know, it's fun.

267
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,176
It's cool.

268
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,808
- [Jackson] I'm gonna
light stuff up their tree.

269
00:07:36,808 --> 00:07:38,038
- [Jared] Just because
it's your anniversary,

270
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,610
I'm letting that happen, okay?

271
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,443
You're a good girl.

272
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:45,386
Penny you love it, I'm
so excited you like it.

273
00:07:45,386 --> 00:07:46,723
(Jared laughs)

274
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:48,091
Is that fun?

275
00:07:48,091 --> 00:07:49,583
Huh, you like that one?

276
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,196
There's no cotton in that one,

277
00:07:51,196 --> 00:07:53,640
you can't destroy that one too bad.

278
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,502
- Penny, I've got you.
- Good girl.

279
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:56,335
- [Jared] You've got the football?

280
00:07:56,335 --> 00:07:57,420
- Yeah.
- Throw it.

281
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,003
(lively music)

282
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,970
- [Jackson] Good girl.

283
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,888
- [Jared] Whoa (laughs).

284
00:08:03,888 --> 00:08:06,144
- Happy anniversary Penny.

285
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:07,673
- That's a sweet thing to say.

286
00:08:07,673 --> 00:08:08,593
Ready?

287
00:08:08,593 --> 00:08:09,426
(squeaking)

288
00:08:09,426 --> 00:08:10,872
Oh she's ready.

289
00:08:10,872 --> 00:08:12,136
Go get it.

290
00:08:12,136 --> 00:08:14,719
(lively music)

291
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:33,048
Are you sayin' hi to Aunt Linda?

292
00:08:33,048 --> 00:08:33,883
(Jared laughs)

293
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:35,778
- [Linda] Shake hands.

294
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:38,551
- [Jared] Did you shake
hands with Aunt Linda?

295
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:39,490
Yeah?

296
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,323
- [Ellie] Do you know she's been waiting

297
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:41,155
to see you all day, Jackson?

298
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:43,296
- [Jared] I know, she's
been waiting for ya bud.

299
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:44,356
- We're gonna eat rolls,

300
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:46,247
we have pie, we have lots of--

301
00:08:46,247 --> 00:08:47,150
- I love pie.

302
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,711
- You love pie?
- Do you love pie?

303
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:49,544
- Yeah.

304
00:08:49,544 --> 00:08:50,377
- [Jared] I do too.

305
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,978
- Well eat some food.

306
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:52,811
- [Jared] Hi Mama.

307
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:54,342
- Okay, just eat a little bit of food,

308
00:08:54,342 --> 00:08:55,686
and a little bit of pie.

309
00:08:55,686 --> 00:08:56,791
(Jared laughs)

310
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,709
I feel sorry I
- Do miss your babies?

311
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:00,893
- No, he just woke up.

312
00:09:00,893 --> 00:09:02,897
- [Jared] He missed you a lot.

313
00:09:02,897 --> 00:09:04,298
- I'm sorry I missed the party,

314
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:06,403
but I loved cooking all day with Mom.

315
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,431
- [Jared] Yeah.

316
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,264
- Can I have a bowl?

317
00:09:09,264 --> 00:09:10,437
- [Jared] Oh you bet I can.

318
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:12,865
- Hey, have fun and be safe.

319
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:14,154
Did you hear?

320
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,611
- We'll be safe.

321
00:09:15,611 --> 00:09:16,444
- Oh crap.

322
00:09:16,444 --> 00:09:17,649
(Jackson crying)

323
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,566
- Aww, buddy.
- I didn't

324
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:25,099
- I didn't now that he was there.

325
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:27,837
Jackson, you're gonna have so much fun

326
00:09:27,837 --> 00:09:29,348
with your cousins.

327
00:09:29,348 --> 00:09:30,787
- You're cousins aren't going.

328
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:32,553
- [Ellie] Your cousins are not going.

329
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:33,857
- [Julie] Do you want
to go play with Cooper?

330
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:34,844
- The next 15 minutes will be dedicated

331
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:35,854
to explaining to Jackson.

332
00:09:35,854 --> 00:09:36,894
(Jackson crying)

333
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:38,776
- [Ellie] He literally
got over that real quick.

334
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:39,944
- That was so fast.

335
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:42,128
I said 15 minutes, more like 15 seconds.

336
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:45,648
- So the boys are going
on their annual shooting

337
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,008
and the kids, the cousins are playing.

338
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,510
Us girls, I wish I would've filmed,

339
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,021
but then part of me is
like oh, I don't know when.

340
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,266
We were in the kitchen
for like nine hours today,

341
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,012
making Thanksgiving dinner.

342
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:57,845
We're pooped.

343
00:09:57,845 --> 00:09:58,678
- Uhhh.

344
00:09:58,678 --> 00:09:59,610
- You're gonna go upload a video,

345
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,098
so we're just gonna wait
around for the boys.

346
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:03,163
It feels good to sit.

347
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:05,034
We made pies, we made turkey,

348
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:07,273
we made stuffing, we made cranberry sauce,

349
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,783
everything Thanksgiving dinner.

350
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,134
We took tons of pictures,

351
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,799
and then tomorrow we're
actually gonna have leftovers.

352
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:13,548
It's like the smartest idea ever.

353
00:10:13,548 --> 00:10:14,772
I think the kids are very happy

354
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,932
that they're able to stay up very late

355
00:10:16,932 --> 00:10:19,058
and just play with cousins.

356
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,397
Handful of cousins over there,

357
00:10:20,397 --> 00:10:21,800
I just beat Julie with foosball.

358
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,633
(laughing)

359
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:23,471
Woo hoo!

360
00:10:23,471 --> 00:10:25,008
- It had been so long
since we played that game,

361
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:26,133
you did awesome.

362
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,558
- Yeah.

363
00:10:27,558 --> 00:10:29,255
Calvin, what are you playing with?

364
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,300
- Truck.

365
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,803
- [Ellie] The truck?

366
00:10:31,803 --> 00:10:32,636
(Calvin growls)

367
00:10:32,636 --> 00:10:33,969
Oh that's scary.

368
00:10:34,865 --> 00:10:37,115
Oh ouchie, oh ouch it hurt.

369
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,869
- Ow?

370
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:40,526
- Oh that's better.

371
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:42,683
(Calvin growling)

372
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,266
(Ellie growls)

373
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,437
- [Jackson] Yay!

374
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:48,987
- [Ellie] Jackson did you score one?

375
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:49,820
- [Jackson] Yeah.

376
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,776
- [Ellie] What?

377
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,129
- I'm proud of you.

378
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:52,962
- Of what?

379
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:54,573
- Let me tell you that I love you

380
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:58,199
because you're Ellie's little boy.

381
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,778
(Ellie laughs)

382
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:01,485
(gentle music)

383
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:02,318
Yes.

384
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:04,787
They found my stash of nickels.

385
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:07,524
(Ellie laughs)

386
00:11:07,524 --> 00:11:09,412
- [Child] Hey.

387
00:11:09,412 --> 00:11:11,899
- [Ellie] I wondered what that noise was.

388
00:11:11,899 --> 00:11:13,711
- [Julie] Calvin knew
exactly what the noise was.

389
00:11:13,711 --> 00:11:15,392
- [Jackson] Yeah!

390
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:17,169
- [Ellie] Putting all the coins in a jar?

391
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:18,002
- Yeah.

392
00:11:18,002 --> 00:11:19,747
- [Ellie] That's funny.

393
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:21,451
- This one's a hard one.

394
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:23,193
- [Ellie] That does look hard.

395
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:26,210
Calvin, do you want to
bring that upstairs?

396
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:28,290
Let's go upstairs okay.

397
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,564
Come here, goodnight.

398
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,397
- Hi.

399
00:11:31,397 --> 00:11:33,280
- All the cousins are going to bed,

400
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,268
and Jared's getting home
from shooting with the boys

401
00:11:36,268 --> 00:11:38,635
and we're actually gonna drive home

402
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,801
to sleep in our own beds tonight.

403
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,778
But, since all the
cousins are going to bed,

404
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:46,354
we're gonna have some quiet
time upstairs, huh Jacks?

405
00:11:46,354 --> 00:11:48,012
All the couches are gone.

406
00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:50,943
Let's do it right by the fireplace.

407
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,550
Come here Calvin, Calvin.

408
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,912
All the couches are in the garage.

409
00:11:55,912 --> 00:11:57,471
Let's play with our games right here

410
00:11:57,471 --> 00:11:58,798
until Daddy gets home.

411
00:11:58,798 --> 00:12:00,322
- Okay.

412
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:01,185
- [Ellie] Hey Jackson.

413
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:02,467
- Be super quiet.

414
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,694
- [Ellie] Okay.

415
00:12:03,694 --> 00:12:04,547
- Shh.

416
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:07,021
- I'll read to you, this is the first.

417
00:12:07,021 --> 00:12:09,023
- [Ellie] Here Calvin, this is yours.

418
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:09,856
- Yeah.

419
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:13,049
Thanks Mommy.

420
00:12:13,886 --> 00:12:15,126
Mine.

421
00:12:15,126 --> 00:12:18,068
- [Ellie] Okay, Jackson
can I tell you something?

422
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:19,151
Look at Mama.

423
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:21,778
Can you see my face?

424
00:12:21,778 --> 00:00:00,000
I'm proud of you.
