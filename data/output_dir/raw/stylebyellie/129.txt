1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:03,210
- If I get a strike on this first bowl,

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,492
the rest of our marriage
years will be perfect, okay?

3
00:00:06,492 --> 00:00:07,403
- A strike?

4
00:00:07,403 --> 00:00:09,163
Well we all know that's unrealistic.

5
00:00:09,163 --> 00:00:11,746
(bright music)

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,810
I want to tell you guys what today is.

7
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,643
- Okay.

8
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:20,095
- [Ellie] Today is Mommy
and Daddy's anniversary.

9
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,894
- Is it gonna be Halloween?

10
00:00:22,894 --> 00:00:24,862
- [Ellie] Not Halloween,
it's when Mommy and Daddy

11
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:28,166
got married, we got
married eight years ago.

12
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:29,788
And I want to show you something.

13
00:00:29,788 --> 00:00:31,044
You wanna see Calvin?

14
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:31,877
They're like they don't care,

15
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,857
but if you guys are gonna come on a date,

16
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,241
you gotta see what's going on.

17
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:37,154
Pick your nose first, get it done.

18
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:37,987
You good?

19
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:40,126
(Ellie laughing)

20
00:00:40,126 --> 00:00:42,959
Look, this is when we got married.

21
00:00:44,816 --> 00:00:47,259
- How could you get married like that?

22
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,092
- [Ellie] We just did.

23
00:00:48,092 --> 00:00:49,518
- Why did you have a crown?

24
00:00:49,518 --> 00:00:50,491
(Ellie laughing)

25
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,818
- [Jared] What did he say?

26
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,559
- [Ellie] Why do you have a crown?

27
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,754
Because I was a princess that day.

28
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:58,308
- [Jared] You want to
know something Jackson?

29
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,321
- Yeah.

30
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:01,814
- She was my princess that day.

31
00:01:01,814 --> 00:01:03,158
(Ellie laughs)

32
00:01:03,158 --> 00:01:05,277
- But who are you?

33
00:01:05,277 --> 00:01:06,110
- [Jared] I was the prince.

34
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:09,353
- [Ellie] And he was my prince charming.

35
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:10,715
Is that cool?

36
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:12,882
- [Jackson] How did you get there

37
00:01:12,882 --> 00:01:14,236
to the waterfalls?

38
00:01:14,236 --> 00:01:16,051
- [Ellie] We just walked to the water fall

39
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,392
and thought it was a pretty picture.

40
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:19,475
Is that cool?

41
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:22,424
Okay, so Mommy and Daddy are gonna go

42
00:01:22,424 --> 00:01:23,488
on a date today.

43
00:01:23,488 --> 00:01:25,321
- Oh I want to see the

44
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,540
Where's the chicken hand?

45
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,021
- [Ellie] (laughs) The chicken hand?

46
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:34,364
That was just on the vlog
when Daddy was in China.

47
00:01:34,364 --> 00:01:35,949
- Are you in China?

48
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:39,532
- [Ellie] No, this is
where we got married.

49
00:01:40,556 --> 00:01:41,407
Cool, huh?

50
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,573
- Why is Aunt Linda there?

51
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:44,900
- [Ellie] Aunt Linda came to the wedding,

52
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,865
see Aunt Linda and Uncle Bobo?

53
00:01:46,865 --> 00:01:47,876
- [Calvin] That's Dad.

54
00:01:47,876 --> 00:01:50,802
- [Ellie] That's not Dad,
that's Uncle Bobo, say Bobo.

55
00:01:50,802 --> 00:01:51,635
- Bobo.

56
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,564
- That's Jared Jared.

57
00:01:53,564 --> 00:01:55,687
- [Ellie] That's Uncle Matt goofball.

58
00:01:55,687 --> 00:01:57,187
- Dad, that's Dad!

59
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,628
- [Jackson] Jared Jared.

60
00:02:02,628 --> 00:02:03,732
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna go

61
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:05,340
on a special date today.

62
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,173
- Me too?

63
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:08,670
- [Ellie] Do you wanna come?

64
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,029
- Where are we gonna go?

65
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,079
- It's a special date for Mommy and Daddy,

66
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,398
so if you're gonna come,
are you gonna be good?

67
00:02:15,398 --> 00:02:16,945
- Is there any kids stuff there?

68
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:17,778
- No.

69
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:22,163
Look at his face, look at his face.

70
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:25,075
Look, I think we're gonna go to lunch,

71
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:28,001
and then I think we're
gonna go do something fun.

72
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,584
- For big kids?

73
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:31,601
- [Ellie] For you too.

74
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,388
It'll be maybe a movie,

75
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:37,716
or maybe we'll go find
something to do that's fun.

76
00:02:37,716 --> 00:02:40,995
- What about I go to the
toy store and get a toy?

77
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,323
- [Ellie] Oh that's what you want to do?

78
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:43,354
- Yeah.

79
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:45,479
- [Ellie] Your face looks so distraught.

80
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,472
(laughing)

81
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:48,760
- Is it way far?

82
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,608
- [Ellie] It's not far.

83
00:02:49,608 --> 00:02:50,640
We're gonna have a fun day,

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,968
and you and Calvin are gonna tag along.

85
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:54,892
Okay?

86
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:57,559
Are you still picking your nose?

87
00:02:59,308 --> 00:03:02,439
(Ellie laughing)

88
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,701
- Did I turn four now?

89
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,263
- No, in January.

90
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:08,088
This conversation is going
off track, quite a bit.

91
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:09,759
Okay, should we go?

92
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:10,592
- Yeah.

93
00:03:10,592 --> 00:03:12,199
- [Ellie] Do you guys wanna
go, or should we stay here?

94
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:13,134
- I wanna come.

95
00:03:13,134 --> 00:03:14,228
- [Ellie] You wanna come.

96
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,582
Calvin, what did you today
that was really cool.

97
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:18,377
What did you do in the bathroom?

98
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:19,370
- Poop.

99
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,491
- [Ellie] What was that?

100
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:22,964
What did you do in the bathroom?

101
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:23,797
- I pooped.

102
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:25,380
- [Ellie] Good job.

103
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,771
- [Jared] Happy anniversary Ellie,

104
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:30,003
we have no furniture.

105
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:30,836
- Woo.

106
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,823
- Here's some parrots.

107
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:36,261
- Let me see.

108
00:03:36,261 --> 00:03:37,094
- [Ellie] Isn't that cool?

109
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:40,511
Daddy's showing him what birds those are.

110
00:03:42,087 --> 00:03:44,183
- [Jared] Can you tell me what they are?

111
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,079
What's the red one?

112
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,152
- Parrot.

113
00:03:47,152 --> 00:03:47,985
- [Jared] That's right.

114
00:03:47,985 --> 00:03:50,142
And what's the black one?

115
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:50,975
- Toucan.

116
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,091
- That's right, that's a toucan.

117
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:54,213
- [Ellie] Yep, Daddy just
taught you that, huh.

118
00:03:54,213 --> 00:03:57,370
We're at our favorite Mexican restaurant.

119
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,746
- For our anniversary.

120
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:03,075
Happy anniversary, happy
anniversary, happy happy.

121
00:04:03,075 --> 00:04:04,659
- [Ellie] Happy eight years.

122
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:06,791
- Can you believe we've
been with each other

123
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,624
for eight years?

124
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,619
Well we've been together for longer,

125
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:09,907
but we've been married for eight years.

126
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:10,750
- [Ellie] It's crazy.

127
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,749
- We made it through the seven year itch.

128
00:04:12,749 --> 00:04:13,953
(laughs)

129
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:14,786
- Yeah, what year do you think

130
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:16,414
has been our hardest?

131
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:18,899
- Well the only itch that
we've gone through is

132
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,510
- [Ellie] I've been doing
a lot of nose picking,

133
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,288
don't judge me.

134
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:23,774
I'm glad that we have the
boys here, this is fun.

135
00:04:23,774 --> 00:04:26,463
- Yes, this is fun to celebrate with them.

136
00:04:26,463 --> 00:04:28,775
- [Ellie] What year do you
think has been the hardest?

137
00:04:28,775 --> 00:04:30,413
I remember the first wasn't,

138
00:04:30,413 --> 00:04:32,084
because after the first year,

139
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,644
we were like, that wasn't bad at all.

140
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:34,641
- No it wasn't bad at all.

141
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,141
I would say years.

142
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:38,760
- Three might have been the hardest.

143
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,664
- I would say three,
between six and seven.

144
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:43,747
- [Ellie] But guess what?

145
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:45,724
- We'll get through it together,

146
00:04:45,724 --> 00:04:46,557
because we're a team.

147
00:04:46,557 --> 00:04:47,390
- [Ellie] Love you.

148
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,223
- I love you.

149
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:49,089
It's getting through that,

150
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,002
it's getting over that together

151
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,750
that makes everything so
much better, you know?

152
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,917
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

153
00:04:55,941 --> 00:04:57,358
- Go go go go go!

154
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,773
- [Jared] Hi.

155
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:05,209
- [Ellie] Jackson, that's
enough, that's good.

156
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:07,340
You don't need that (laughs).

157
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,491
Hey, who taught him that dance move?

158
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:11,033
- I don't know, but they were pretty good

159
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:12,528
so it must've been me.
- That one.

160
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:13,942
- [Jared] Can you show
us some dance moves?

161
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:14,775
- No!

162
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:15,608
- Oh.

163
00:05:15,608 --> 00:05:17,839
I be you never thought
you'd be ending up here

164
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,384
on our eight anniversary.

165
00:05:19,384 --> 00:05:21,051
We're going bowling.

166
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:22,876
- I was telling Jared,

167
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,844
it's like happy anniversary Jackson.

168
00:05:24,844 --> 00:05:26,644
Jackson has been jumping and screaming

169
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:27,794
and is so excited.

170
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,825
- [Jared] He can't get
those shoes on fast enough.

171
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:31,658
That is so funny.

172
00:05:31,658 --> 00:05:33,350
Hey Jackson are you excited to go bowling?

173
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,183
- Yeah.

174
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:35,514
- [Jared] Yeah.

175
00:05:35,514 --> 00:05:37,181
Aww yeah, you ready?

176
00:05:39,619 --> 00:05:43,915
Dude you're gonna kill
it today, I know it.

177
00:05:43,915 --> 00:05:47,516
Poor little Calvin fell
asleep on the way here.

178
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:51,315
- Why does that have a crunchy mouth?

179
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:53,955
- [Jared] Because he loves those pins,

180
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:55,951
he gonna eat all those pins,
just like your bowling ball

181
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:58,259
is gonna eat all those pins down there.

182
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,092
- Are you ready to rumble?

183
00:05:59,092 --> 00:05:59,979
- I'm ready.

184
00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:01,102
Okay, so here's the deal Ellie.

185
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:02,181
This is our bet, okay.

186
00:06:02,181 --> 00:06:05,840
If I get a strike on this first bowl,

187
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,873
the rest of our marriage
years will be perfect, okay?

188
00:06:08,873 --> 00:06:09,982
- [Ellie] A strike?

189
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:10,815
- A strike.

190
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:11,648
That's all I have to do.

191
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,148
If I get a strike, our
marriage will be perfect.

192
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:15,174
- Okay.
- Forever.

193
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,154
- Well we all know that's unrealistic.

194
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:17,987
Okay let's see.

195
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:19,347
- You don't think I can
get a strike, do you?

196
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,520
- No I, come on, let's see it.

197
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,865
(laughing)

198
00:06:21,865 --> 00:06:22,698
- Ready?

199
00:06:22,698 --> 00:06:23,948
- [Ellie] Yeah.

200
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,935
(pins knocking)

201
00:06:27,935 --> 00:06:29,161
- Oh!
(Ellie laughing)

202
00:06:29,161 --> 00:06:31,911
(dramatic music)

203
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,001
- Perfect years.

204
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:36,251
That's awesome.

205
00:06:37,783 --> 00:06:39,033
That's awesome.

206
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:41,556
- Woo!

207
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:42,552
- [Ellie] He is so ready.

208
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:45,600
Let Mama go and then it's your turn okay?

209
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,844
- Okay, I mean what's your
deal, what's your deal?

210
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:49,595
- Well I know I'm not gonna get a strike.

211
00:06:49,595 --> 00:06:50,616
- [Jared] Okay (laughs).

212
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:52,367
- If I hit more than five pins,

213
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,781
you put kids to bed tonight.

214
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,698
- [Jared] Oh okay okay.

215
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:01,777
(pins clanking)

216
00:07:01,777 --> 00:07:02,610
Oh!

217
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,169
- You get to put the kids to bed tonight.

218
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,184
- [Jared] Okay Jackson, your turn buddy.

219
00:07:08,184 --> 00:07:09,197
Whoa.

220
00:07:09,197 --> 00:07:10,114
Oh my gosh.

221
00:07:12,104 --> 00:07:12,937
- What?

222
00:07:12,937 --> 00:07:14,290
- [Jared] 10 pins, look at that.

223
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,482
- Look at how good you did.

224
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,512
- [Jared] That's so good, high five.

225
00:07:17,512 --> 00:07:19,064
You get to go again too.

226
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:19,897
- Yeah.

227
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:21,490
I got them all.

228
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,251
- [Ellie] You got a full strike.

229
00:07:24,251 --> 00:07:25,794
That was cool

230
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:26,885
That was cool.

231
00:07:26,885 --> 00:07:28,086
- I get a prize!

232
00:07:28,086 --> 00:07:29,346
(Ellie laughs)

233
00:07:29,346 --> 00:07:31,929
I need to get all of them down.

234
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,252
(pins knocking)

235
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:36,085
- Oh!
- Oh!

236
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,605
- [Ellie] So close, you did good,

237
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:43,272
let's try and hit that last one.

238
00:07:44,667 --> 00:07:48,084
- Let's see if you can get that last one.

239
00:07:52,024 --> 00:07:53,024
Oh my what,

240
00:07:55,914 --> 00:07:56,747
you did it!

241
00:07:56,747 --> 00:07:59,080
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah I won!

242
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,899
You guys lose.

243
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,211
(laughing)

244
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,122
Because I won.

245
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:10,076
- [Ellie] You just had a sore pity party.

246
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:12,218
- That turned around real quick.

247
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:15,385
(groovy upbeat music)

248
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,117
- What?
- Yeah!

249
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:26,186
- You won.

250
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,845
- Yay I get a prize!

251
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:31,145
- You won.

252
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:33,645
You beat Mom and you beat Dad.

253
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:35,649
What the heck?

254
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,150
- Jackson got 115.

255
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,331
- 101, what did you get?

256
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:44,764
- I got 94, but I will say,
in my personal defense,

257
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:46,367
for my own dignity.
- Yes.

258
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:50,176
- I gave Jackson a strike
that I thought was my own.

259
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:51,342
- True, true.

260
00:08:51,342 --> 00:08:52,750
- [Jared] So I think that
would've done it for me,

261
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,842
I don't know.

262
00:08:53,842 --> 00:08:55,675
Hey bud, was that fun?

263
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:57,520
- I'm gonna get a prize.

264
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,530
- You will get a prize.

265
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:00,730
But guess what, you played,

266
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,076
and you played hard
and you won, didn't ya?

267
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,573
I'm proud of you.

268
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:05,406
- He got a little cocky for a second.

269
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:06,332
- Yes he did.

270
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:07,690
We gotta shrink that head a little bit.

271
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,903
- Seriously, he was like, Jackson?

272
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:10,351
- We're doing a little swaparoo.

273
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,615
Calvin woke up from his nap

274
00:09:11,615 --> 00:09:13,635
and Jackson fell asleep.

275
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:14,468
What do you have Calvin?

276
00:09:14,468 --> 00:09:17,296
Can you show us what
you have in your hand?

277
00:09:17,296 --> 00:09:18,129
(gasps)

278
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:19,339
What is it?

279
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:20,172
Cookie.

280
00:09:21,097 --> 00:09:22,492
Cookie.

281
00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:24,015
I can't think of a better way
to celebrate our anniversary,

282
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,245
- But he's eating mine.

283
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:27,221
- Than going to Swig and
getting some cookies.

284
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,484
(Penny barking)

285
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:31,093
It's about that time Ellie.

286
00:09:31,093 --> 00:09:32,645
Gotta take Penny for a walk.

287
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,320
She's asking for it.

288
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,590
- She saw us, she wants a cookie too.

289
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,594
- Okay do you want to see it?

290
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:38,755
Are you ready for it?

291
00:09:38,755 --> 00:09:40,635
This is the first time I've seen it,

292
00:09:40,635 --> 00:09:42,714
but it's done, it's finished.

293
00:09:42,714 --> 00:09:44,964
Sanded, smoothed, polished,

294
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,260
(pop) it's a little fumy in here,

295
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,093
(laughs) it's a little fumy in here,

296
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,510
but this is the floor redone.

297
00:09:53,787 --> 00:09:56,085
It looks pretty good, it
looks very very shiny.

298
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,596
We have to be off of
it, for a little while,

299
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:01,471
like another hour or so before
we can start walking on it.

300
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,685
And then I think we'll wait until tomorrow

301
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,454
before we put the furniture back,

302
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,440
but it looks great, it looks awesome.

303
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,834
And to celebrate our anniversary,

304
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,209
we're having dinner in the basement.

305
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:12,082
- Oh yeah.

306
00:10:12,082 --> 00:10:13,623
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

307
00:10:13,623 --> 00:10:14,795
- Mom's not cooking.

308
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:15,628
- [Jared] Woo!

309
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:17,417
- At all today.

310
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,239
- Because we can't eat anywhere else.

311
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:22,052
Holy Schnikes, oh save the bag.

312
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,610
We don't have a table upstairs, but we do

313
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,535
Oh we have a table down here.

314
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:28,645
- Oh cute, I'd rather
just sit on the floor.

315
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:31,387
- You do that, maybe I'm
gonna eat at the table,

316
00:10:31,387 --> 00:10:32,687
because I have a hip condition.

317
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:34,162
- [Ellie] Jared doesn't like to sit.

318
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:34,995
- It's true.

319
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:35,875
As much as I want to,

320
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:38,860
I'd like to sit on the floor,
but my hips can't take it.

321
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,175
That's probably the one thing

322
00:10:40,175 --> 00:10:43,060
that's really really inhibiting for me

323
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,011
and limiting, because I can't sit

324
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,083
criss cross applesauce very easily.

325
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:48,916
- Muscles!

326
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,581
- [Jared] Oh look at you muscle man.

327
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:51,995
Here let me help ya.

328
00:10:51,995 --> 00:10:53,632
Oh good job.

329
00:10:53,632 --> 00:10:55,552
Oh my goodness.

330
00:10:55,552 --> 00:10:56,385
What is he drinking?

331
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:58,256
Oh you have a little cup
for him full of water.

332
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,307
- He wanted to drink out of this

333
00:11:00,307 --> 00:11:02,180
so I said go to the kitchen
and he got a mini cup.

334
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,013
- Cute.

335
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:04,358
Kids come here, we need to have a talk

336
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,391
Alright, and I need you to listen.

337
00:11:05,391 --> 00:11:07,995
Mom and Dad had a bet earlier today,

338
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,030
the bet was if Mom hit
more than five pins,

339
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:13,334
then I would put you to
bed, okay, both of you.

340
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:14,821
You and you.

341
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:16,920
They're obviously not even
listening to me Ellie.

342
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,253
- No no bedtime.

343
00:11:19,684 --> 00:11:20,876
- So here's the deal,

344
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:22,736
I'm gonna put you kids to bed,

345
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,509
this place is a disaster down here,

346
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:25,342
so you're gonna clean up?

347
00:11:25,342 --> 00:11:26,175
- No!

348
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:29,198
(Jared laughing)

349
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:31,908
- [Jared] Just the
dinner, just the dinner.

350
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,408
- No I'll pick up.

351
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,064
- [Jared] What are you doing?

352
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:41,137
(laughing)

353
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:43,804
Calvin, what are you boys doing?

354
00:11:45,026 --> 00:11:46,559
Ahhh!

355
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,157
Hey, oh no, it's attack of the dead.

356
00:11:50,157 --> 00:11:50,990
Ahhh!

357
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:55,453
Aww, you're giving me hugs.

358
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:57,725
I love that attack.

359
00:11:57,725 --> 00:12:00,853
Well there you have it,
eight years in the books.

360
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,845
I can't believe it's been eight years,

361
00:12:03,845 --> 00:12:06,549
'cause sometimes when I
think about eight years,

362
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:08,357
it seems like so short,

363
00:12:08,357 --> 00:12:09,293
but when you look back,

364
00:12:09,293 --> 00:12:12,868
it seems like such a long
time too, it's so crazy.

365
00:12:12,868 --> 00:12:15,618
And every year has been so different

366
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:18,184
for Ellie and I and our anniversaries.

367
00:12:18,184 --> 00:12:20,601
I mean looking back to the first year,

368
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:22,320
(laughs)

369
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,487
I think our first anniversary
was our worst anniversary,

370
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,164
but not in a bad way,

371
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,651
but like our car axle broke

372
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:34,020
on our way to a romantic weekend getaway

373
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,963
and we couldn't do it anymore.

374
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,064
Like Ellie's parents and
a neighbor had to come

375
00:12:39,064 --> 00:12:42,591
pick us up, because we
didn't have a car to drive.

376
00:12:42,591 --> 00:12:46,687
We were driving out of
my grandma's house area

377
00:12:46,687 --> 00:12:49,985
or something like that and
poof, the axle just broke.

378
00:12:49,985 --> 00:12:52,650
We were just talking about our memories

379
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:56,185
of our anniversaries and
it just takes me back

380
00:12:56,185 --> 00:13:00,569
and I just am really excited
about the anniversaries

381
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,761
and all the other momentous occasions

382
00:13:02,761 --> 00:13:05,171
that Ellie and I will
be celebrating together

383
00:13:05,171 --> 00:13:07,435
as we live life together.

384
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:08,866
I love her so much

385
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,300
and she means the world to me.

386
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:14,290
And I'm so grateful to
have her in my life.

387
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,483
So with that, I'm gonna end the vlog.

388
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:17,889
Thank you guys for watching.

389
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:19,298
Happy anniversary Ellie,

390
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,391
and we'll see you guys next time.

391
00:13:20,391 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
