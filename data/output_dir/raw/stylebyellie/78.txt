1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,519
- Good morning Calvin.

2
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:03,080
(Jared laughs)

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:05,750
This little kid, oh my gosh,

4
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,840
we've been running around the entire house

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,740
getting everything packed and ready to go

6
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,140
to get out of here on time.

7
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,560
Cleaning, doing dishes, doing laundry

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,520
filling up jugs with chocolate milk.

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,095
And the peace that Calvin has

10
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,595
is just kinda something sweet.

11
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,220
We are getting ready to say goodbye

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,935
to our vacation home, we're
getting everything packed

13
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:29,460
and ready to go.

14
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,620
Joel, I just want to let you know

15
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:32,320
that I had a really nice time.

16
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:35,620
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that,

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,960
I should not have done that.

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,010
- That warms my heart that you said that.

19
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,990
That's good praise.

20
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,240
And Jared, I always have a
really nice time with you.

21
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,695
(laughing)

22
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:53,909
- Eww, I was feeling a little left out.

23
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,393
That's a little close
in the morning, Jare!

24
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:58,055
- [Jared] Sorry Bonnie,
we'll put the filter on.

25
00:00:58,055 --> 00:00:58,953
(laughing)

26
00:00:58,953 --> 00:00:59,998
- [Joel] Make a filter on it.

27
00:00:59,998 --> 00:01:01,410
- Bonnie, I also had a really nice time.

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,510
- Thank you.

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,849
- [Joel] Hey, that's my
wife you're talking about.

30
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,810
- Joel, I didn't wink,

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,418
I didn't wink.
- Oh.

32
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,471
- I didn't do that.

33
00:01:09,471 --> 00:01:12,850
- So we'll see you in two
minutes as we carpool.

34
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,330
- Goodbye St. George.

35
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,750
- Goodbye St. George, we had fun,

36
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,580
- Goodbye St. George.

37
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,730
- and we're closing the door.
- Did you hear Calvin?

38
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,900
- What did he say?

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,870
- Say it loud.

40
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,449
- Bye bye!

41
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:25,920
- Bye bye!

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,020
Let's lock this oh.

43
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:31,419
We're gonna lock this guy.

44
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,850
How do you lock it?

45
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,700
There we go.

46
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,930
Okay, alright, now we can say goodbye.

47
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,380
Goodbye house, we had so
much fun in St. George.

48
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,806
It was nice and warm, compared to Utah.

49
00:01:43,806 --> 00:01:45,760
(bell dings)

50
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,370
And we're heading back up north.

51
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,050
- [Ellie] Are you tired?

52
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,120
Do you want to close your
eyes 'til we get there?

53
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,310
Okay.
- Close your eyes.

54
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,550
- Okay goodnight.
- Goodnight.

55
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,980
- We'll see how long that actually lasts.

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,950
I think they will be asleep soon.

57
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,850
They've been going to
sleep at like 11 o'clock

58
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,055
in the morning.

59
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:08,520
Yes.
- Oh at 11 in the morning.

60
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,803
- [Jared] I was like they have not been up

61
00:02:09,803 --> 00:02:10,750
'Til 11 at night.
- No, sorry,

62
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,520
- they've been taking a nap

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,720
at like 11 in the morning,

64
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,970
because they've been so tired,

65
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,280
because they play play.

66
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,566
And we've been putting them to bed,

67
00:02:17,566 --> 00:02:20,702
except one night, like on bed time,

68
00:02:20,702 --> 00:02:22,640
but they just have been playing so hard.

69
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,560
- Yeah, I love that they've been playing

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,810
and having as much fun as we have.

71
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:28,330
Like that's the fun part about a trip,

72
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,530
it's like Ellie and I have
been having a ton of fun

73
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,330
and the kids have been
having a ton of fun.

74
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,290
That's how you know,

75
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,210
it's a good trip.

76
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,440
- [Ellie] He's out for the count.

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,273
What about you?

78
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,810
- [Jared] All you have to
do is pretend to be asleep

79
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,840
- No!
- and then it may happen.

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,270
- [Ellie] No?

81
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,800
Okay, close your eyes.

82
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,760
Close 'em.

83
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,496
Goodnight.

84
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:50,637
(Ellie laughs)

85
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:52,510
- [French Narrator] Six
and a half hours later.

86
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,800
- Home sweet home,

87
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,970
it always feels good to walk in

88
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,580
to your house, and where--

89
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,530
there is Jared, Jared
and Penny are playing,

90
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,820
getting some exercise in.

91
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,910
I--

92
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,450
wait, where's your baby?

93
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,260
Where's your baby?

94
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,340
Where'd your baby go?
- Where baby go?

95
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
- [Ellie] Where did you baby go?

96
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,960
Calvin came home and grabbed his baby.

97
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,540
Where's the bottle?

98
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,480
And he started feeding his baby.

99
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,780
Oh, there's the bottle.

100
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,340
He started feeding his baby.

101
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,410
- Did he really?

102
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,243
- [Ellie] Yeah.

103
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,200
Let me see your baby, Cal.

104
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,250
Is that baby brother?

105
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,120
Yeah, and guess what else Calvin did?

106
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,693
When I got Calvin out of his car seat,

107
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:30,943
he goes, potty.

108
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:34,490
And I was like, do you need to go potty?

109
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,100
And he sat on the toilet

110
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,207
and he went everything.

111
00:03:38,207 --> 00:03:39,950
He went potty, I'm so proud of him.

112
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,760
- It's just a great new year,

113
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,593
is what it is.

114
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:44,130
- Yes, the last several times

115
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,480
he's had to go poo,
he's gone in the toilet

116
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,950
and I'm so proud of him.

117
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,012
But we need to get everybody's haircuts.

118
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,150
- [Jared] Yep.

119
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,270
- I'm so proud of Calvin.

120
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,570
Such a relief when they start asking

121
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,980
and they're doing so well.

122
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,180
I think what I'm gonna do

123
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,230
is it's cold outside

124
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,560
and the garage is really cold.

125
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,010
I think I'm going to move this stuff,

126
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,460
cut everyone's hair and then clean this,

127
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,310
and then move it all back,

128
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,800
because in here needs to be cleaned.

129
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,370
- That's great for me,
because I don't want

130
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,650
to get my hair cut when it's cold outside.

131
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,370
- Yeah and the kids would be miserable.

132
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,720
They would be like I'm not having this so,

133
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,410
we'll do that, and then afterwards,

134
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,212
Mama's gonna pamper herself.

135
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:21,045
- Bottle!

136
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,823
- [Ellie] The bottle?

137
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:23,656
Are you feeding the baby?

138
00:04:23,656 --> 00:04:24,700
- Uh-huh.

139
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,596
- Oh cool.
- Mama.

140
00:04:26,596 --> 00:04:28,290
- [Ellie] What?

141
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:30,366
Is that your Batman book?

142
00:04:30,366 --> 00:04:31,199
- Look at this.

143
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,460
- Oh the scary joker?

144
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:37,171
Our little trip turned out to be,

145
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:40,010
hey, nobody get ready for three days

146
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,550
and it actually was amazing,

147
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,650
but tonight, I'm gonna show you guys

148
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,840
what I've been doing with my nails

149
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,757
to get them so pretty and long.

150
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:50,550
They have a hint of yellow

151
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,700
because I've been using a nail polish

152
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,240
and then I had gotten into the hot tub

153
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,200
and it kinda made them a little yellow,

154
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,652
but I'm gonna show you what
I've been doing with them.

155
00:04:59,652 --> 00:05:00,730
- Baby bottle.

156
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,130
- [Ellie] What are you guys doing?

157
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,130
Were you guys feeding the baby?

158
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:04,963
- Yeah.

159
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:07,440
- [Ellie] Are you excited
to have a baby brother?

160
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,640
Another little brother?

161
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,819
I think that you're gonna
want to hold him a lot.

162
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:13,510
- I want to hold him too much.

163
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,720
- [Ellie] You think you will?

164
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,553
- Uh-huh.

165
00:05:15,553 --> 00:05:16,386
- [Ellie] You know how you ask me

166
00:05:16,386 --> 00:05:18,300
to snuggle you and watch movies?

167
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,133
- Yeah.

168
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:20,020
- [Ellie] Do you think
the baby will snuggle you

169
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,110
and watch a movie?

170
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:21,943
- Yeah.

171
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:22,800
- [Ellie] I bet he will.

172
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,740
I think that will be so fun.

173
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,937
- [Jackson] I want to
watch a movie right now.

174
00:05:26,937 --> 00:05:27,854
- Right now?

175
00:05:27,854 --> 00:05:28,950
- [Jackson] Yeah.

176
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,960
- We've been in the car all day,

177
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,660
I think that's a negative.

178
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,530
I think we should get ready to do haircuts

179
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:37,190
and then take a nice warm bath.

180
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:40,280
Welcome to my salon today.

181
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,113
Ready Jackson?

182
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:42,197
- Yep.

183
00:05:42,197 --> 00:05:43,030
(razor buzzing)

184
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,863
- Okay.

185
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:47,760
Look all the way down at your toes.

186
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,270
A little further, perfect.

187
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,546
Holy cow, you had some long hair.

188
00:05:55,546 --> 00:05:58,713
(bright guitar music)

189
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:07,294
You know I've been cutting your hair

190
00:06:07,294 --> 00:06:10,711
since you were just like nine months old.

191
00:06:12,187 --> 00:06:13,071
Can you believe that?

192
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,599
You were just little.

193
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,800
- I'm not little.

194
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,540
- Not any more, but you were.

195
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,020
When I started to cut your hair,

196
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,450
when you were just a little baby.

197
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,570
- But then I was crying?

198
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,510
- No, you did so good.

199
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,010
When you were a baby
and I'd cut your hair,

200
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,460
I was worried that you would cry.

201
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,440
But you didn't cry, you did so good.

202
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,780
And I used to do this,
when you were a baby.

203
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,430
And I'd say see?

204
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,269
It doesn't hurt.
- Yeah.

205
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,070
- See how it doesn't hurt.

206
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,420
That's most of the time why babies cry,

207
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,710
it's because they're worried,

208
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,080
- Uh-huh, they are worried.

209
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,380
- 'Cause it's kinda loud.

210
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:55,632
(bright guitar music)

211
00:06:58,970 --> 00:06:59,803
- No.

212
00:07:00,954 --> 00:07:04,278
- Okay turn your body this way.

213
00:07:04,278 --> 00:07:07,445
(bright guitar music)

214
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,330
- It's 2018.

215
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,050
It's about time we did this.

216
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,870
You guys know on our camera,

217
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,150
it's not the best camera.

218
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,620
The focus is going in and out like crazy,

219
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,176
there are dead pixels,

220
00:07:27,176 --> 00:07:28,160
and if you don't know what that means,

221
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,470
I'll show you right now.

222
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,470
When I put this right here,

223
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,280
you'll notice that there's like

224
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,610
two or three,
(bell dings)

225
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,220
maybe even four spots that are not black,

226
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,350
those are dead pixels.

227
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,070
That means that the information

228
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,270
that the camera is filming

229
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,190
does not transfer through the sensor.

230
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,530
And it just shows up as a red dot

231
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:52,830
on the LCD or whatever you're viewing at.

232
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,630
So like I said, it's about time

233
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,340
we got a new camera.

234
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,440
I have been waiting for Canon to announce

235
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,890
a new G7X, like Mark III or whatever,

236
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,310
something that is good quality,

237
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,100
that's pocketable, for almost a year.

238
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,140
This camera has been able for nearly

239
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,558
two and a half years, two years?

240
00:08:13,558 --> 00:08:15,720
But we've had it ever since it came out

241
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
and I'm just dying for Canon to come out

242
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,420
with another one.

243
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:22,587
I've tried the Sony RX100 Mark IV and V,

244
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,830
and didn't like it,

245
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,900
just because the flip
up screen right here,

246
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,720
it gets cut off and just everything isn't

247
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,000
as fluid and as easy as the G7X.

248
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,440
Sometimes, like when we were in St. George

249
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,500
at the Mars area, we filmed with this

250
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,559
and it looks really great,

251
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,089
but you just can't put that
in your pocket and film

252
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,510
whenever you want.

253
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,100
So like I said, we're just going back

254
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,950
to the G7X Mark II, a new version.

255
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,290
Hopefully you'll be able to tell

256
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,123
what it looks like.

257
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,940
In fact, let's switch over to it right now

258
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,599
in three, two, one,

259
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:55,932
and here we are.

260
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,580
Hopefully this looks at
leas a little bit better,

261
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,750
and hopefully the focus
is a little bit faster,

262
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,400
hopefully there's no dead pixels.

263
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,790
I do want to show you.

264
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,380
Oh, actually I think the
crop is off a little bit,

265
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,400
I need to change the
stabilization settings,

266
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,530
but I have to show you this other camera

267
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,320
that we've been using
for such a long time,

268
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,980
the condition that it's in.

269
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,030
So right here, you can see

270
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:21,340
there's so many cracks in that screen

271
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,830
and then this doesn't
even close all the way.

272
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,190
You see that all the way
around, and then up top.

273
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,800
I've even gone as far
as to replace the screws

274
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,740
on this paneling,

275
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,310
so right here and right here,

276
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,570
and I'm missing the pins
right here and right here.

277
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,570
Do you see how wobbly that is?

278
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,850
That's what that does.

279
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,550
So it's just been loved to death.

280
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,184
I mean we drop it in
the snow all the time.

281
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,510
But it's about time we got a new camera,

282
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,170
so hopefully it looks at least

283
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,910
just a little bit better.

284
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,480
And for those of you who don't know,

285
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,690
this is the camera that we use

286
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,670
when we film our normal regular vlogs,

287
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,760
is the Canon G7X Mark II.

288
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,190
If you have other questions about filming,

289
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,340
or anything like that,

290
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,030
I think it'd be fun to do a vlog

291
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,750
or a series on my channel,

292
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,180
as far as what we do
for filming and editing

293
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,430
and the whole process.

294
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,280
Hey bud.

295
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,113
- Hi.

296
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:12,946
- [Jared] How are you?

297
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:13,779
- Good.

298
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,020
- Good, your hair cut looks so fresh,

299
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,760
so smooth, so good.

300
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,593
- [Ellie] You working?

301
00:10:17,593 --> 00:10:19,200
I'm good to go do my nails?

302
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,269
- Yes you can go do your nails.

303
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:23,686
- I will not drop the camera.

304
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,270
When was the last time we got a new one?

305
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,160
- It's been a few months,

306
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,780
that one's taken quite a beating.

307
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,720
- When you do daily videos,

308
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,530
your camera gets some
good wear and tear on it.

309
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,820
Growing up, my mom always
had long fingernails.

310
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,960
She hardly painted them,

311
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,220
she never did anything like fake nails,

312
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,940
she just had naturally long,

313
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,580
really pretty nails.

314
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,880
And I mean she would clean the house,

315
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,070
she'd do yardwork and her
nails never seemed to break

316
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,950
and I've always envied that about her.

317
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,930
And I always wanted long nails

318
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,940
and I've never really
taken care of my nails,

319
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,590
because I was in the salon

320
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,300
and they were always wet

321
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,820
and I would always just
file them really short

322
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,610
and then with kids and
they're always in water

323
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,443
and I'm cleaning,

324
00:11:07,443 --> 00:11:09,890
and it just seems like I just can't ever

325
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:10,820
seem to grow them out.

326
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,020
So I've tried to take
advantage of being pregnant,

327
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,920
being on pre-natal
pills, my hair and nails

328
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,110
growing like crazy.

329
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,170
And I've been really proud of them.

330
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,210
I have had many people notice them

331
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:23,150
and say, wow you're nails
look really healthy.

332
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,870
Jinger did this week,

333
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,770
I thought that was so nice.

334
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,540
Like I said, they have
a little yellow hint

335
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,650
to them, because I have
clear nail polish on

336
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,930
and I had gotten in the hot tub.

337
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,810
They're kind of dingy.

338
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:35,050
So what I usually do to keep them up,

339
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,450
and it sounds really high maintenance,

340
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,940
because it is right now,

341
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,600
but if I'm not on top
of them every few days,

342
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,040
one of them will break

343
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,320
and then it's like, I have to start over.

344
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:49,487
So every four days, I will
remove the clear polish,

345
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,300
I will buff 'em a little bit

346
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,950
and hardly file them.

347
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,880
Just so they are smooth.

348
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,140
And then I don't just
put clear coat on them,

349
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,680
I put a strengthener on them,

350
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,400
this is an Essie
strengthener that I put on.

351
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,690
In the past I've always
used just clear nail polish

352
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,470
on top, just to give it a barrier,

353
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,480
so they're not just like raw nails

354
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,100
prone to break and split and stuff.

355
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,970
And I've had two nails split

356
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,930
and I've just filed them smoothly.

357
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,640
I try and keep cuticle oil on them

358
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,690
when I remember.

359
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,700
And I've just been doing a really good job

360
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,090
and that's one thing I've always wanted

361
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,720
and I'm really proud of myself

362
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,540
that I've been able to
keep some healthy nails.

363
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,840
But yeah, I do that every four days,

364
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,830
just so I can keep them up,

365
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:33,910
but I'm sure once they're
at a really good length

366
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,320
and I can get 'em to be really strong,

367
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,110
I won't have to do it that often, so.

368
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,480
Yep, that's what I'm doing.

369
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,540
I've been watching my friend

370
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,670
the Healthy Grocery Girl,

371
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,980
her pregnancy update, while
I've been doing my nails.

372
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,570
This is the final product.

373
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,460
This is what they look like.

374
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,800
Look how long and smooth they are.

375
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,200
And then this is this hand.

376
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,020
I am so proud of them.

377
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,580
I think it's been five weeks

378
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,700
since I've started this

379
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,500
and they are at a really good length

380
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,380
and they just look really healthy,

381
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,590
I'm so proud.

382
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,100
- It's 10:16 in the evening

383
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,160
and I've got my work buddy
by my side, hi Penny.

384
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:16,030
And the rock tumbler is
going on in the background.

385
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,040
I think Penny senses that I'm a little,

386
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,680
I don't know, just sad.

387
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,210
I'm reminiscing.

388
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:25,070
I am editing the--

389
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,410
(laughs)

390
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:30,070
I am editing the New
Year's video right now

391
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,370
and I'm going through our year

392
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,230
that Ellie and I went through.

393
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,551
And every time I go through

394
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:42,384
these miscarriage videos, the D&C,

395
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,950
it just ah--

396
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,210
I don't think you ever lose that emotion

397
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,140
or that pain.

398
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,680
And I'm just really grateful

399
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,100
that we were able to overcome that

400
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,720
and be where we are now.

401
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,880
There's so many lessons that Ellie and I

402
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,100
have learned as a couple together

403
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,010
to go through these moments in our life.

404
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,177
And also just seeing the happy laughter,

405
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,850
the joy that we've had over 2017.

406
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,820
It's been wonderful.

407
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,310
It literally has been the highest of highs

408
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,960
and the lowest of lows.

409
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,270
And I wouldn't have it any other way.

410
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:36,220
If we don't experience the lows,

411
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,160
we won't know the joy that we can have.

412
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,670
And I'm grateful for it.

413
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:45,540
I'm grateful that we've captured it,

414
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,180
as difficult as some of this has been,

415
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,510
I'm grateful that we
have it to look back on.

416
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,850
Life can be hard.

417
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,470
Life can be fun.

418
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,860
Life can be so many of these things.

419
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,070
So many different things can happen to us.

420
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,310
All I know is that I am so grateful

421
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,980
that I have my family with me

422
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,850
to go through life.

423
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,940
And I cannot wait for 2018.

424
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,110
We're in it right now,

425
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,380
and it's going to be a wonderful year.

426
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,030
Thank you guys so much for watching

427
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,870
the video today.

428
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,400
I hope you have a wonderful 2018.

429
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,540
I hope you have some great goals

430
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,310
that you guys are going to accomplish

431
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,650
and we will see you tomorrow.

432
00:15:33,650 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
