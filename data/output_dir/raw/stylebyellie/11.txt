1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:02,494
- World's biggest bath bomb.

2
00:00:02,494 --> 00:00:03,327
(bright music)

3
00:00:03,327 --> 00:00:05,708
- I see my doggie's head!

4
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:06,541
(Ellie laughs)

5
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,965
- My worries and fears have actually

6
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:11,030
gotten maybe a little worse.

7
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,361
I was like, what were you thinking?

8
00:00:14,361 --> 00:00:15,416
Ah!

9
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:16,248
- Oh bud.

10
00:00:16,248 --> 00:00:18,090
Good morning guys, it's not 20 minutes

11
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,970
before the next day

12
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,520
and we already have more controversy.

13
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,838
- Why did you put a Band-Aid in your hair?

14
00:00:23,838 --> 00:00:24,711
- I have an owie.

15
00:00:24,711 --> 00:00:26,661
- You have an owie?
- Why'd you do it?

16
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:27,494
- I don't know.

17
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,678
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

18
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:31,209
- He got an owie on his head
and he put a Band-Aid on it.

19
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:34,385
- Look at this, look
at him, he's flinching.

20
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:35,577
I'm trying to be really soft.

21
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,410
- {Jared] I think you should just

22
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:38,303
pull it off like a Band-Aid.

23
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:39,136
- Ah!

24
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,120
- [Jared] Oh bud.

25
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,607
- Calvin, don't--

26
00:00:41,607 --> 00:00:42,440
- Ow.

27
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,300
- I know.

28
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,200
- [Jared] Band-Aids are
supposed to help, not hurt.

29
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,457
- I've never dealt with Band-Aids in hair.

30
00:00:47,457 --> 00:00:48,720
- Get the peanut butter,

31
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,269
actually that'll probably work.

32
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:51,170
- That's what we'll do.

33
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,420
Calvin, don't do that, come here.

34
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,270
- [Jared] Let's get your hair wet.

35
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,950
That'll make it come off a lot easier.

36
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:56,783
- Look at that.

37
00:00:56,783 --> 00:00:58,970
Like if I were to try,
he's like no no no no no.

38
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,340
(Calvin cries)

39
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,173
We'll just get it wet.

40
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:02,120
- [Jared] Yeah, get it wet, get it wet.

41
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,170
You guys need a bath
anyway, you're stinky.

42
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,540
You got some stinky bums.

43
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:06,920
After camping trip,

44
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,420
the best thing in the whole
entire world is showering,

45
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,430
taking a bath when you're all done,

46
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,210
getting all of that gunk and grease

47
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:17,864
and goodness off of you.

48
00:01:17,864 --> 00:01:18,988
- Ow!

49
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:20,340
Ow, ow!

50
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,460
- Does it hurt?

51
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,628
- No.

52
00:01:22,628 --> 00:01:23,461
- Ow!

53
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,048
- I don't think it does.

54
00:01:25,048 --> 00:01:26,046
- Yeah it does.

55
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:27,637
- It does a little?

56
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:28,999
- You have my thumb.

57
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:30,082
- Your thumb?

58
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,613
Oh don't you bite me, you little turd.

59
00:01:35,613 --> 00:01:37,747
What happens if you bite me?

60
00:01:37,747 --> 00:01:39,371
- No I'm licking you.

61
00:01:39,371 --> 00:01:42,110
- Oh, 'cause I would bite you right back.

62
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,940
And then you would cry.

63
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,988
- Yeah.

64
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:45,821
(Ellie laughs)

65
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:47,210
- [Jared] Well Ellie,
then you would have him

66
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,600
turn into a vampire.

67
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,250
I'm not sure if you guys know
this, but Ellie's a vampire

68
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,820
and if she bites Jackson,

69
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,770
Jackson will turn into a vampire too.

70
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,390
I know we've shown Ellie
in front of mirrors before,

71
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:02,150
but we have set that
up with camera trickery

72
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,030
and duplicated layers and everything

73
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:04,863
throughout all the vlogs.

74
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,320
That's why editing takes so long.

75
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,060
And the daylight is actually
just natural blue light.

76
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,330
Everything that we film actually
is actually at nighttime

77
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:13,990
but this light out here that you see

78
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,680
is a natural daylight bulb

79
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,770
that is shining on the
outside of our house.

80
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,630
It's a long process that
we have to go through.

81
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,360
We've never mentioned
it before in the vlogs,

82
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,160
but I just thought we'd finally say it.

83
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,253
Ellie, she's a vampire.

84
00:02:27,226 --> 00:02:28,220
(scary music)

85
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,270
- Alright guys look at this.

86
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,310
Jackson, pregnancy with him at 25 weeks,

87
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,720
Calvin 25 weeks.

88
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,480
I guess I should be wearing a black shirt,

89
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,810
which I am.

90
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,731
And baby, at 25 weeks.
- Do you need a little scarf?

91
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:42,564
- Look at that.

92
00:02:42,564 --> 00:02:43,397
- [Jared] Yeah.

93
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,760
- I look so different each pregnancy,

94
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,890
I'm just like is that even me?

95
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:48,964
Okay let's take a picture,

96
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,360
then I'll have all three side-by-side.

97
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,410
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

98
00:02:52,253 --> 00:02:53,680
- Awww.

99
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,513
- Sorry.

100
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:59,105
(Ellie laughs)

101
00:02:59,105 --> 00:03:00,813
- I love hugging you.

102
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,403
- I sometimes love this too.

103
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,010
- We literally today
after I got ready guys,

104
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,380
this morning we hugged and I was like oh,

105
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,570
it was awkward and then we hugged again

106
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,450
and it was awkward,

107
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,370
and then he's like here, let me--

108
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,410
- Here, let me concave.

109
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,696
- And I was like perfect fit.

110
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,363
- It's the puzzle piece.

111
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:23,210
- Alright guys, I've been
doing what I love the most,

112
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,423
which is quiet.

113
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:26,256
(laughs)

114
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:29,210
And organizing and just
being in my own element.

115
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,870
I don't know why, I would love

116
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,230
to go to people's homes and just clean.

117
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,100
I really enjoy just wiping up,

118
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,322
reorganizing stuff,
seeing a before and after,

119
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:43,870
that's stuff that's soothing to me.

120
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,290
And I know I've said this before,

121
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:46,980
but it's kinda like peoples' crafts.

122
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,230
I'm not as crafty of a person,

123
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,090
but I can see why people
would love crafts,

124
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,110
because that's their element,

125
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,990
that they can sit down and create.

126
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,830
And so anyway, that's
what I've been doing.

127
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,230
Look my mirror's still so dirty

128
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,260
with the kids playing with Play-Doh,

129
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,240
but I posted a picture on
Instagram of me being 25 weeks.

130
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,740
And then me being 25 weeks

131
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,450
with the other two babies,

132
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,990
so it's really fun to
see my belly side-by-side

133
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,750
and just how I've changed.

134
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,700
Looking back at those pictures how I felt

135
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,310
during those times versus how I feel now.

136
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,610
it's just really fun to look back on.

137
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:19,870
But I'm gonna show you
guys what I've been up to.

138
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,269
First I'm gonna start right here.

139
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,020
I found the perfect bench
that I want right here

140
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,660
that I'm gonna ask for
Mother's Day or something,

141
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,000
but it is so cute.

142
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,930
It's from Lulu and Georgia,

143
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,345
I found it a few weeks agao,

144
00:04:33,345 --> 00:04:34,970
but it's a really cute fluffy bench

145
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,803
to go right here.

146
00:04:35,803 --> 00:04:38,015
I've just been bringing
the benches from my room in

147
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,410
and it's not very fun
to always pick 'em up.

148
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:41,610
And bring it back and

149
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,860
I would like to have a bench here,

150
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,270
so that's on my list.

151
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,220
I have my little mirror
that I get ready with,

152
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,670
my grandma gave me this dish.

153
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,650
And this is my favorite perfume ever.

154
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,800
It's Michael Kors and it's super flowery,

155
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,450
which usually is not what I would like,

156
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,740
I used to really like sweet scents,

157
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,950
but lately I've been
liking the floral scents.

158
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,840
It's not Jared's way favorite,

159
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,380
but it's my favorite, I love it.

160
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,270
And of course, I put my
make-up in my new case.

161
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:06,900
This is what I used to have.

162
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,700
It was this smaller case
that I got from Muji,

163
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
that I would have my make-up in and on

164
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,320
and then I'd put my lipsticks on there

165
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,750
and then we got our sample products,

166
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,770
so I've been using that

167
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,480
and I officially just put it in my case.

168
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,550
So this was like 40
dollars that I paid for,

169
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,560
and this is our case.

170
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,600
You can tell it's a lot bigger.

171
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,420
But I have all my make-up in here,

172
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,070
my lipsticks, you can tell
the Nars is my favorite,

173
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:36,460
my make-up, everything and brushes.

174
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,050
So that is my getting ready section,

175
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:41,220
that I've officially
organized and cleaned.

176
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,857
And then I've gotten this drawer

177
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,680
and this is all my getting ready stuff,

178
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,830
my face washes, eye creams, my lotions.

179
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,690
I've talked before that
I've been a huge fan

180
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,020
of Shiseido and there
hasn't been another product

181
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,890
that I've been like yes,
I love these face washes

182
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,170
and creams as much,

183
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,900
until this last year.

184
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,990
And I really like the brand Skin.

185
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,470
I like their face masks a lot.

186
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,200
And then of course, I've talked about

187
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,620
I like Dermalogica a lot

188
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
and then I like Rodan + Fields,

189
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,450
so I kinda have a mix of both of those

190
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,640
that I really like.

191
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,590
So I have this all organized,

192
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,920
my getting ready products.

193
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,630
And then I like to do pedicures a ton,

194
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,490
so I actually have a drawer for pedicures.

195
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,590
I got his bad boy on Amazon.

196
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,050
It's a foot scrubber and it's amazing.

197
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:30,480
And I just have everything I need

198
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,890
for my own pedicures at home.

199
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,370
So just a foot softener,
lotions, cuticle remover.

200
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,890
So that's my little drawer for pedicures

201
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,160
and then down here under this cabinet,

202
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,400
I got this at Target.

203
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,570
I've loved having this.

204
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,500
It just holds all my curling iron stuff.

205
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,010
Bonnie and I are doing a
hair tutorial this week.

206
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,600
And a lot of people have been asking

207
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,690
what curling wand I use.

208
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,710
and I use the Nume wand.

209
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,920
This one's a tapered one,

210
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,820
but I do have a regular one as well.

211
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,200
But that's that

212
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,820
and then this was our
sample product that came

213
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,390
before we had our logo
and the buttons on it

214
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,660
and just to see how we like the structure.

215
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,486
So up top is all my combs that I have,

216
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:12,990
then I have my belly massage bar.

217
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,920
It's from Lush, this is called Therapy.

218
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,240
A lot of people asked
what I use, it's Therapy.

219
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,110
And then I just have all my nail stuff,

220
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,340
I love to do my nails,

221
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,790
I love to do my toenails,

222
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,930
so it's kinda like my own stuff at home.

223
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:27,300
That's my nail polishes.

224
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,050
And then just my hair
products getting ready.

225
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,800
So that is my bathroom, it is organized.

226
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Next on to the main bathroom.

227
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,020
In our main bathroom,
we have a cupboard here

228
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,880
that's kinda crazy that
I'm gonna sit and organize

229
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,780
and I want to get a shelf
ready for when I have the baby,

230
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,670
like a heating pad and everything

231
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,780
that I'm gonna need for
when I deliver the baby.

232
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,950
So I need to organize this

233
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,500
and then I'm gonna feel really good today.

234
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,350
Then my list is done.

235
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,630
But Bonnie and I are doing a giveaway.

236
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,550
It is Mother's Day around the corner

237
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,140
and we are going to be giving away

238
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,730
two dresses, two robes, two workout gears

239
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,480
and two organizing cases,

240
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,610
so if you guys want to enter,

241
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,670

Bolliebrand, our Instagram.

244
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,480
We'll have everything in the description,

245
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,840
but we're doing a huge giveaway,

246
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,480
so if you guys want to
enter to win any of those,

247
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,380
go ahead and go do it.

248
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,940
In the meantime, I'm just gonna sit here

249
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,650
in my happy place and organize.

250
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,180
So Calvin just came in
to go to the bathroom

251
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:30,270
and he this morning has been such a pill.

252
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,810
Between the Band-Air in his hair,

253
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,990
I went downstairs today

254
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,909
and I was like, what were you thinking?

255
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,459
He literally peed inside

256
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,270
of Jackson's car garage toy downstairs.

257
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,970
And I was like, what are you doing?

258
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,103
Okay, flush the potty.

259
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,990
And I couldn't help,

260
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:49,620
I try not to laugh in frontt of the kids,

261
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,070
when they do something naughty,

262
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,610
but I couldn't help but laugh,

263
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:54,220
I was like, what were you thinking?

264
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,420
He's pointing, for his prize.

265
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,040
Calvin still gets a little prize

266
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,090
if he goes potty,

267
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,120
because i still feel it's pretty new

268
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,950
still with him going and it
still is keeping him excited,

269
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,050
and looking forward to
going to the bathroom,

270
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,230
so he still gets prizes when he goes.

271
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,063
Did you get one?

272
00:09:12,063 --> 00:09:13,550
You got two?

273
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,383
Show me.

274
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,160
Whoa.

275
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,411
Your favorite color.

276
00:09:19,411 --> 00:09:20,244
- Yeah.

277
00:09:20,244 --> 00:09:21,840
- [Ellie] Is your favorite color green?

278
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,673
- No.

279
00:09:22,673 --> 00:09:23,834
- [Ellie] What's your favorite color?

280
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:25,290
- Red, two red.

281
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,123
- Two reds.

282
00:09:26,123 --> 00:09:28,070
I said that because I knew
it wasn't his favorite color.

283
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,650
I always kinda put green on Calvin,

284
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,010
but he actually really loves red.

285
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,000
Alright, that finally
looks a little better.

286
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,813
The kids have a shelf, I have a shelf.

287
00:09:35,813 --> 00:09:38,138
I got these at Target when we moved in.

288
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:39,830
I thought it looked so cute

289
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,014
and matched in here.

290
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:41,847
What's up?

291
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:42,840
You need underwear on.

292
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,510
Did Dad tell you to come some?

293
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,440
I organized this, this is Calvin,

294
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,630
there's some pull-ups, some underwear.

295
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,730
He's really picky.

296
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,250
He likes the Roar ones.

297
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,007
Can you find one?

298
00:09:53,007 --> 00:09:53,840
- [Calvin] No.

299
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
- [Ellie] You can't?

300
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,553
You gotta choose.

301
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,824
- [Calvin] This.

302
00:09:57,824 --> 00:09:58,657
- [Ellie] Oh the last one.

303
00:09:58,657 --> 00:09:59,650
Okay, put 'em on.

304
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:03,930
Back to this, then I have
my section, Jared and I's,

305
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:06,300
and then just down there
is our heating pad,

306
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,320
some pads and that is it.

307
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,930
That is our close in there,

308
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:13,250
so my bathroom and this
bathroom, check, done.

309
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,050
I'm seriously grabbing
things from around the house

310
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,110
and just putting them away.

311
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,625
And I'm putting the MiraLAX

312
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,500
(laughs)

313
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,260
next to the pads,

314
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,250
for in three months, when I need all that.

315
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,700
I would think that after
Jackson and Calvin,

316
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,970
I wouldn't be nervous delivering

317
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,210
and having another baby,

318
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,700
but I actually feel like
my worries and fears

319
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,710
have actually gotten maybe a little worse,

320
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:44,520
because I know what happens
and I know how you recover.

321
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,710
I don't know, maybe for
some it's not that way,

322
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,260
but for me, it totally is.

323
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm not really nervous to give birth,

324
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,480
but I'm really nervous for the after care,

325
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,331
because the pains that you have

326
00:10:53,331 --> 00:10:57,010
when you're recovering are a
lot stronger after each baby

327
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,680
or at that's the way it's
been with me and my family.

328
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,770
And just having to go to the bathroom

329
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,320
for the first few times
after delivering a baby

330
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,880
has always terrified me

331
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,242
and I'm really nervous for that.

332
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:10,075
(laughs)

333
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,107
I'm not looking forward to that.

334
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:13,321
But I'm looking forward
to everything else.

335
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,270
I'm looking forward to
kissing my sweet baby, huh?

336
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,340
We gotta officially name you.

337
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,700
I think we're pretty close.

338
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:22,050
- We are just having a
little snack as a family.

339
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,350
- Apples and caramel.

340
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,400
- Apples and caramel.

341
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,280
And I thought this would be a fun time

342
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,970
to talk to Jackson about something.

343
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,340
On our trip to Vegas,

344
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,830
we saw lots of what in the sky?

345
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,360
- Clouds.

346
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,790
- Clouds, yes, we saw lots of clouds.

347
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,840
And there was rain and there
was all kinds of clouds

348
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,355
and everything and I wanted to teach you--

349
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:45,930
- And thunder.

350
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,420
- And thunder, that's right.

351
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,740
And I remember as a kid

352
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,470
we would make clouds in bottles

353
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,350
and I wanted to teach you

354
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,913
how we can make a cloud
inside of this bottle.

355
00:11:56,913 --> 00:11:58,130
You thought the clouds were so cool,

356
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,730
so I thought, let's
make one at home, okay?

357
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,240
And I'm gonna show you
guys how to do it too,

358
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,670
it's really simple.

359
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,200
All you need is a bottle, a match

360
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,370
and some hot water.

361
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,700
So I'm gonna go put some hot water

362
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,540
just in the very bottom of this.

363
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,373
- Okay.

364
00:12:11,373 --> 00:12:12,550
- And then we'll light the match

365
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,654
and I'll show you exactly
what we're doing, okay?

366
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,200
Now I'm gonna teach
you how to make a cloud

367
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,390
inside of a bottle.

368
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:19,955
- It's not serious.

369
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:21,687
- [Ellie] It's not serious?

370
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:22,520
- Yeah.

371
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,040
- [Jared] You don't think
there's gonna be a cloud in here?

372
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,199
- No.

373
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,032
- [Ellie] Oh!

374
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,360
- You don't think there's gonna be a cloud

375
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,142
inside this bottle?

376
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:29,975
- I think--

377
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:31,720
- Okay, challenge accepted.

378
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,310
What do I get,

379
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,696
if I can make a cloud
inside of this bottle?

380
00:12:35,696 --> 00:12:36,930
- Using hot water.

381
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,340
- Using hot water, yeah.

382
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,270
What will you give me,

383
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,792
if I can make the cloud in this bottle?

384
00:12:41,792 --> 00:12:42,625
- A match.

385
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:46,378
- A match, okay, challenge accepted.

386
00:12:46,378 --> 00:12:49,740
(bright music)

387
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,713
So we've got this water in here.

388
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:53,097
So what I'm gonna do,

389
00:12:53,097 --> 00:12:55,680
is just blow a little bit.

390
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,660
And increase the pressure in there, okay?

391
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,280
So now I've got water in here.

392
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,620
There's a little pressure in here

393
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,054
and we're just gonna shake it up.

394
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:02,887
(sloshing)

395
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:04,130
Make sure the cap is on (laughs).

396
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,790
Shake it up, do you want to shake it up?

397
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,720
I'll trade ya.

398
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,555
Now it's a little hot,
so just be careful, okay?

399
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:10,388
(sloshing)

400
00:13:10,388 --> 00:13:11,600
Real good, shake it hard.

401
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,562
Shake it like you've never
shaked before, my son.

402
00:13:14,562 --> 00:13:15,395
There ya go.

403
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,120
So now what we're going to do

404
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,850
is we're going to light this match

405
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,490
and we're going to have
it go inside of here

406
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,770
but in a very special way,

407
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,430
so watch closely, okay?

408
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,260
I'm gonna light this match.

409
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,160
So I've got this match.

410
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,210
And what I'm gonna do

411
00:13:31,248 --> 00:13:33,820
open it up and let the smoke go in there.

412
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,550
We have the smoke inside of here

413
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,370
and the water inside of here.

414
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:40,370
Now what I'm gonna do is squeeze this

415
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,480
and that's gonna increase the pressure.

416
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,500
And when you increase the pressure,

417
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,880
that increases the temperature,

418
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,670
so it gets a little warmer in here.

419
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,710
And then when you let go,

420
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,720
it lowers the temperature

421
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,340
and that's when the cloud will form.

422
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,690
So go ahead and squeeze it.

423
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,890
(crunching plastic)

424
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,130
Squeeze, do you see how it's clear?

425
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,963
Let it go.

426
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:02,490
Now if you look right
here, do you see that?

427
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,910
Squeeze, let go.

428
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,476
You see the cloud in there?

429
00:14:05,476 --> 00:14:06,309
- Uh-huh.

430
00:14:06,309 --> 00:14:07,142
- Open this up,

431
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,810
the cloud will come out.

432
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:10,760
You see right here?

433
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,360
Do you see that?
- Woo, poof.

434
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,193
- Is that cool?

435
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:15,760
Do you see the cloud?

436
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,653
Boop, boop boo.

437
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,291
- Can I try?

438
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,670
- Okay do it.

439
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,247
(crunching plastic)

440
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,487
(Jared laughs)

441
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:25,970
- [Ellie] Ah, it's coming out.

442
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,760
- You're making the cloud in our house.

443
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,780
- Is that cool?

444
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,079
When it was raining and
storming on the way home,

445
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,020
Jackson was seriously
like, where's the sky?

446
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,180
Why is it raining?

447
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,900
- Why isn't the sky blue?

448
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,110
- It was such a long drive

449
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,380
and he was just staring
outside for so long.

450
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,980
- His brain was just going
through all of these questions,

451
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,520
why does the rain fall?

452
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,020
Why is the sky blue?

453
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,840
Why isn't the sky blue right now.

454
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,331
Why are there so many clouds?

455
00:14:51,331 --> 00:14:52,794
- Rain, the rain.

456
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:54,456
- Oh you wanna see it?
- You wanna see rain?

457
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:55,289
- Okay, so look there.

458
00:14:55,289 --> 00:14:56,122
(crunching plastic)

459
00:14:56,122 --> 00:14:56,955
Can you see the cloud?

460
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:57,793
It's clear,

461
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,930
mix the temperature and pressure.

462
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,513
(Ellie laughs)

463
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,100
I guess I'm not good enough.

464
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,050
- [Ellie] He was done.

465
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,020
- Anyway, Jackson had
all of these questions

466
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,640
and I thought, we can learn
about all of this stuff

467
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,776
and we can use these
bottles to teach them,

468
00:15:16,776 --> 00:15:19,280
because it's really easy
to do that kinda stuff, so.

469
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,057
I thought this would be
a fun experiment to do.

470
00:15:21,057 --> 00:15:22,490
Was that cool bud?

471
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,775
Good, I'm glad you liked it.

472
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:24,870
- Thank you.

473
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,283
- You're welcome buddy,
did you learn something?

474
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:28,116
- Yeah.

475
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:29,030
- Oh good.

476
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,170
- [Ellie] Calvin, come help me.

477
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:33,160
Give your doggie a kiss.

478
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,457
And say it's time to clean you.

479
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:37,440
- It's time to clean you.

480
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,132
- [Ellie] Okay, put him in the washer.

481
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:39,965
- No!

482
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:41,403
- [Ellie] Calvin, Calvin.

483
00:15:42,324 --> 00:15:43,157
- No!

484
00:15:43,157 --> 00:15:44,805
(laughs)

485
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:47,200
- [Ellie] Hey look look, kiss your doggie.

486
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
Give your doggie a hug.

487
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,739
He's so dirty, we gotta wash him.

488
00:15:50,739 --> 00:15:51,572
- No!

489
00:15:51,572 --> 00:15:52,980
- You know how you take
baths when you're dirty?

490
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,485
Do you take baths?

491
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:55,318
- No!

492
00:15:55,318 --> 00:15:56,151
- Your doggie needs a bath.

493
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:56,984
- [Ellie] You know how
your doggie poo pooed?

494
00:15:56,984 --> 00:15:57,853
Look.

495
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,740
You know on the trip, the
doggy ate lots of food

496
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,990
and he poo pooed.

497
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,230
- Your doggie needs a bath, I'm sorry bud.

498
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,508
We have to give your doggie a bath.

499
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,341
- [Ellie] Hurry.

500
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,190
- Just like you get a bath.

501
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,473
- [Ellie] Do you want to put him in?

502
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:11,370
Okay come on.
- Yeah okay go, go put him in.

503
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,160
- [Ellie] Hurry hurry,
we'll give him a bath.

504
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,230
It's gonna spin.

505
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,830
Should we watch him?

506
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,753
Yeah.

507
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,480
Okay, now this one.

508
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,170
Good job.

509
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,320
This little dog has been
around for two years

510
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,310
and we've never really washed washed him

511
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,312
and it's disgusting.

512
00:16:32,312 --> 00:16:33,570
(laughs)

513
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,631
Okay, should we watch him?

514
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,148
Okay we'll watch him get clean, okay?

515
00:16:38,148 --> 00:16:38,981
- Okay.

516
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:39,814
- Okay.

517
00:16:39,814 --> 00:16:41,020
His eyes are down.

518
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,030
- His eyes are gonna be closed?

519
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,190
- Yeah.

520
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,340
- We'll watch him spin.

521
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:47,805
Okay.

522
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:50,799
- Spin.

523
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:53,450
- Spin.

524
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,800
Okay, he'll get nice and clean

525
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,965
and then you can have him tomorrow, okay?

526
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:57,798
- Okay.

527
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:58,631
- Okay.

528
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:01,321
- I saw my doggie's head!

529
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,215
(laughs)

530
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,373
- Did you see his head?

531
00:17:03,373 --> 00:17:04,205
- Yeah.

532
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:05,389
- He was sitting right up.

533
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,099
Okay, so he has another stuffed animal

534
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,979
that he carries around

535
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,530
and I just will spot clean it.

536
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,089
I don't know if it's a bad idea

537
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:13,809
that I'm putting this
in the washing machine,

538
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,060
but I feel like it just needs it,

539
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,400
and if it ruins it, we
might just have to find it.

540
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,540
Is he in there?

541
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,373
- Yeah.

542
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,205
- So funny.

543
00:17:21,205 --> 00:17:22,506
- Why is he in there?

544
00:17:22,507 --> 00:17:24,220
- His doggie's in there to get washed.

545
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,380
Can you believe that it is six o'clock?

546
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,619
The day has flown by.

547
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:30,070
We've been cleaning and organizing all day

548
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,340
from getting home from our trip.

549
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,831
And Calvin put a Band-Aid
on his puppy dog.

550
00:17:33,831 --> 00:17:35,650
- [Jared] Awww, make sure he's okay.

551
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,060
- Yeah cute, huh, he put a
Band-Aid on his puppy dog..

552
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,040
- That's sweet.

553
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,720
- We're gonna go ahead and say goodbye,

554
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,220
get these kids wrapped up.

555
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:44,150
And we're gonna try and have
a little in-home date night.

556
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:44,983
Will you hold him?

557
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:45,890
- Absolutely I'll hold him.

558
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,910
- I was gonna chuck him across the room.

559
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,960
- Now one question I had,

560
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,950
so I just did that experiment with Jackson

561
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:50,890
with that bottle.

562
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,700
Let me know if there's
any other experiments

563
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,070
that you would like us to do

564
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,260
in the comments down below.

565
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,440
I think this would be fun for me

566
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,670
to do with the boys,

567
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:59,280
something like father-son bonding,

568
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,480
but also educational.

569
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,435
I would love to hear
your thoughts on that.

570
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:04,280
So, that's gonna be it
from us, thank you guys.

571
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,676
- More bath bomb videos for Mom.

572
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,187
- Yes, bath bomb.

573
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:09,260
Worlds biggest bath bomb.

574
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,443
Okay, we'll see you guys next time.

575
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:14,025
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

576
00:18:14,025 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye sticky.
