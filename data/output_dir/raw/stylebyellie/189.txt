1
00:00:00,518 --> 00:00:03,593
(upbeat instrumental music)

2
00:00:03,593 --> 00:00:04,905
- [Grandma] Those pilots
right there are wavin' to you.

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,238
- [Ellie] Can you wave back?

4
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:12,057
Say, "I did it!"

5
00:00:12,057 --> 00:00:13,577
- [Calvin] I did it.

6
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:14,410
- [Jared] Yay!

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,243
(laughing)

8
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:18,660
(screaming and laughing)

9
00:00:23,103 --> 00:00:24,998
- Is Calvin gonna come to the airport?

10
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:28,725
- He is, as soon as that
little stinker wakes up.

11
00:00:28,725 --> 00:00:30,244
Good morning guys.

12
00:00:30,244 --> 00:00:31,841
We are getting ready to go.

13
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,559
Jared, you just gotta brush your teeth.

14
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:34,392
- [Jared] I'm brushin' my teeth.

15
00:00:34,392 --> 00:00:35,940
- Zip that up, we're good to go.

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,415
So, I'm just getting my shoes on.

17
00:00:37,415 --> 00:00:39,912
And even though these are
really high, they're actually

18
00:00:39,912 --> 00:00:41,390
very comfortable.

19
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,111
And I thought this was very interesting,

20
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,372
because yesterday, Jared was
saying like, "Brownie points

21
00:00:45,372 --> 00:00:49,551
"to this spouse, or the significant other

22
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:52,509
"that notices a change
in the other person."

23
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:54,969
And Jackson looked at my
toenails this morning and goes,

24
00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:57,023
"Why are they red?

25
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,827
"Where's your blue toenails?"

26
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:00,916
Like he loved the blue toenails.

27
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,839
And he talked about my blue
toenails for a long time.

28
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,802
And I think it's so funny that he noticed.

29
00:01:04,802 --> 00:01:06,770
You are so sweet.

30
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,353
(jazzy instrumental music)

31
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,455
I spy an older couple
staring at their phone.

32
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:26,654
- Hello.

33
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:27,487
- [Ellie] Who is it?

34
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,748
Who could it be?
- Hello!

35
00:01:28,748 --> 00:01:30,221
(Ellie laughing)

36
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:32,106
- [Ellie] Get off your phone!

37
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:35,689
(jazzy instrumental music)

38
00:01:46,218 --> 00:01:48,749
Are you gonna Instagram Grandpa's picture?

39
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:51,616
He's pretty brave to put
that in front of you.

40
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,806
No!

41
00:01:52,806 --> 00:01:54,144
You guys, fly safe.

42
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:55,004
Isn't this funny?

43
00:01:55,004 --> 00:01:57,624
We have run into mom and dad
a few times at the airport

44
00:01:57,624 --> 00:01:59,795
(laughing) while they're on their way.

45
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,686
- One of these days, we're
gonna go to the same place.

46
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:03,208
- We are goin' to Disney Land!

47
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:04,233
(laughing)

48
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:07,135
- Mom and dad are going to Germany!

49
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:08,785
- They're doin' like
a whole European trip.

50
00:02:08,785 --> 00:02:10,425
- What fun.
- Yep.

51
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:13,097
We're goin' to see Jennifer's
brother who's over there.

52
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:14,776
- Yes, my Uncle Todd's over there

53
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:16,859
doin' a service mission.
- Are you goin'

54
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:18,085
to go to Disney Land?

55
00:02:18,085 --> 00:02:19,070
(laughing)

56
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,381
- Someday.

57
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:21,644
Someday we're gonna go

58
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:22,540
to Disney Land.
- Should we take

59
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,892
Grandma and Grandpa to
Disney Land sometime?

60
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,150
- You take me with you.

61
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,733
(jazzy instrumental music)

62
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,324
- [Grandma] Those pilots,
right there, are wavin' to you.

63
00:02:45,324 --> 00:02:46,157
Can you wave back?

64
00:02:46,157 --> 00:02:46,990
- [Ellie] One more time.

65
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,601
- [Grandma] One more time, wave to 'em.

66
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,729
- Look!
- They're wavin'!

67
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:53,390
- [Jared] Hey Jackson, if
you wanna fly the plane,

68
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,987
now's your chance to ask.

69
00:02:54,987 --> 00:02:56,691
Do you wanna go fly the plane?

70
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:57,953
- [Jackson] No.

71
00:02:57,953 --> 00:02:58,813
(laughing)

72
00:02:58,813 --> 00:02:59,679
- Okay.
- You changed

73
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:00,860
your mind?

74
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,443
(jazzy instrumental music)

75
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,334
- [Jared] Do you see that Ellie?

76
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,477
Do you see that?

77
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:23,855
- Hi!
- It has our name on there.

78
00:03:23,855 --> 00:03:24,724
- Yay!
- That's never

79
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:25,913
happened before.

80
00:03:25,913 --> 00:03:27,187
- [Ellie] You're our guide today!

81
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,535
How are you?

82
00:03:28,535 --> 00:03:30,007
- [Jared] Look, there's our name Jackson.

83
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:31,237
Is that cool?

84
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:32,545
- Yeah.

85
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,455
- Okay guys, I think that
there is a fine line,

86
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:38,977
and I never want, ever, to
come across as complaining.

87
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:41,724
But I also wanna come across
and tell you how awful

88
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:43,774
(laughing) that flight was.

89
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:46,841
- We are lucky to have
great kids, aren't we?

90
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:48,648
- Oh, our kids are the best.
- We really, really are.

91
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:50,523
But this was different (laughs).

92
00:03:50,523 --> 00:03:53,420
- To be honest, we've just
gotten done with a lot

93
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,179
of traveling, too.

94
00:03:55,179 --> 00:03:57,098
I just wanted to tell you guys that that,

95
00:03:57,098 --> 00:03:59,685
'cause every flight, like,
"Our kids were so good,

96
00:03:59,685 --> 00:04:00,913
"our kids were so good."

97
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:02,470
But I just wanted to let
you know that they're not

98
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,784
always so good.

99
00:04:03,784 --> 00:04:06,255
And it wasn't crazy,
they're just so tired.

100
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,065
Calvin is so done.

101
00:04:08,065 --> 00:04:09,088
So, we're in the car.

102
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,478
We're meeting Brian and Missy
- Woo!

103
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:12,735
halfway, I can't wait
to go eat some dinner.

104
00:04:12,735 --> 00:04:14,085
We're all starvin'.

105
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,603
And get some play in.

106
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:17,365
- [Jared] Calvin is adamant
to hold both of our hands,

107
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,024
so I put his crackers in
his mouth so he could hold

108
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,586
both our hands (laughing).

109
00:04:22,586 --> 00:04:26,253
(upbeat instrumental music)

110
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:32,884
- What a better way to
get off of an airplane

111
00:04:32,884 --> 00:04:35,884
and run free in this cute play area.

112
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,074
We are at some sort of Be
play area, and the kids

113
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,490
are just running free.

114
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,500
And you can run and
touch anything you want,

115
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,333
play.

116
00:04:47,196 --> 00:04:48,427
This is so cute.

117
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:50,148
So you didn't wanna sit on
an airplane, but you wanna

118
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:51,619
sit on this?

119
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,036
What, what, what?

120
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:56,380
Hello!

121
00:04:57,549 --> 00:04:58,568
Are you comin'?

122
00:04:58,568 --> 00:05:01,435
(laughing)

123
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:03,074
I think he liked it, but his face!

124
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:04,755
(laughing)

125
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:08,422
(upbeat instrumental music)

126
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,140
Go down together.

127
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,557
- [Jackson] Whee!

128
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:14,667
- Woo!

129
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,346
Okay, Missy told me to go down this one

130
00:05:16,346 --> 00:05:17,640
'cause it's really steep.

131
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,109
(yells)

132
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:21,359
(laughing)

133
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:28,257
- Look how (laughing) hesitant he is.

134
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:30,047
- [Ellie] You can overcome fear.

135
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:31,214
You can do it.

136
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,063
You're so hesitant.

137
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:35,001
- [Jared] Go for it!

138
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,834
- [Ellie] You can do it!

139
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:36,799
- [Jared] Yay!

140
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,268
- [Ellie] Say, "I did it!"

141
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:39,185
- I did it.

142
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:41,537
- [Jared] Yay!

143
00:05:41,537 --> 00:05:44,247
- Okay, so for us bein' in
California and in this huge mall,

144
00:05:44,247 --> 00:05:46,169
I feel like we have the
whole mall to ourselves.

145
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:47,002
- Yeah (laughs).

146
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:48,749
- This is amazing.

147
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:50,390
Come on boys.

148
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,577
I wanna go together.

149
00:05:51,577 --> 00:05:53,053
Is that Finn?

150
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:53,996
Is that Finn?
- Say, "Hi Finn."

151
00:05:53,996 --> 00:05:55,467
Can you say hi?

152
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,320
- [Finn] Hi.

153
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,403
- [Ellie] Hi.

154
00:05:58,403 --> 00:06:01,653
(laughing and yelling)

155
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,448
There the boys are.

156
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:09,290
You guys are running too fast!

157
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:12,957
(upbeat instrumental music)

158
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,460
Want help up?

159
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,305
Can you make it up more?

160
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:20,055
You use this, babies.

161
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:23,503
Here ya go, ya baby.

162
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:24,819
Climb up.

163
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:25,890
Climb up.

164
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,701
You made it.

165
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:29,592
Cuties, let's go!

166
00:06:29,592 --> 00:06:33,259
(upbeat instrumental music)

167
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:37,784
Ready?

168
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:39,329
Woo!
- [Calvin] Yeah.

169
00:06:39,329 --> 00:06:42,246
(yells and laughs)

170
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:45,848
- Did you see his face?

171
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:47,794
Going with the two babies was not smart,

172
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:49,228
but they liked it.

173
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:52,230
Don't tell Missy I almost
threw Finn half down the slide.

174
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,897
(upbeat instrumental music)

175
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,907
- This obviously is like
one of the best places

176
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:17,378
for kids and for us.

177
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:19,681
Like, I am having just as
much fun as the kids are.

178
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:20,514
- Very enjoyable.

179
00:07:20,514 --> 00:07:22,681
- Brian, stop shooting me!

180
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,567
(upbeat instrumental music)

181
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,616
Okay Jackson, hit the button.

182
00:07:36,616 --> 00:07:39,616
(air whooshes)
Whoa!

183
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:46,408
Was that so cool?

184
00:07:48,024 --> 00:07:49,660
This is absolutely hilarious.

185
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,859
There is a noticeable difference in smell

186
00:07:52,859 --> 00:07:55,356
walking right over here (laughing).

187
00:07:55,356 --> 00:07:57,254
I think 90% of it is because of Jackson

188
00:07:57,254 --> 00:07:58,690
and Calvin's shoes.

189
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,246
Whoo!

190
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:01,230
- [Ellie] Okay, Jer-Bear.

191
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,256
- Code word is whiskey.

192
00:08:02,256 --> 00:08:06,129
- [Ellie] Whoever throws
up gets to choose dinner.

193
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:08,129
(yells)

194
00:08:09,996 --> 00:08:10,829
- Whoa!

195
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,541
Whiskey,

196
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:15,421
whiskey!
(laughing)

197
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,566
- [Brian] That's the secret word, whiskey.

198
00:08:16,566 --> 00:08:18,367
- [Ellie] Your turn.

199
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:20,944
(upbeat instrumental music)

200
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:22,954
How many of you babies can we get sick?

201
00:08:22,954 --> 00:08:25,370
- Whoa!
- Whoa, look how happy--

202
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,620
(laughing)

203
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,030
- [Ellie] He's like, I'm out.

204
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:32,806
- [Jared] I'm outta here.

205
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:36,085
- [Brian] It's like a
washing machine for toddlers.

206
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:38,312
- [Ellie] Okay, Jackson
has requested to go faster.

207
00:08:38,312 --> 00:08:39,534
Hold on tight.
- Ready?

208
00:08:39,534 --> 00:08:40,518
- One,

209
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,681
two (laughs),

210
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:43,946
three.

211
00:08:43,946 --> 00:08:44,946
Whoa!
- Whoa!

212
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:47,833
- Was that fun?
- How was it?

213
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:50,000
- Come on.
- You liked it?

214
00:08:51,214 --> 00:08:52,828
- He might be out of it.

215
00:08:52,828 --> 00:08:55,325
- [Ellie] Hey, did you like it?

216
00:08:55,325 --> 00:08:56,348
He's too busy.

217
00:08:56,348 --> 00:08:57,537
He loved it.

218
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,483
- He's not even in the same place.

219
00:08:58,483 --> 00:08:59,794
- Just a mild concussion.
(Ellie laughing)

220
00:08:59,794 --> 00:09:00,780
- Okay, round two.

221
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,542
Brian musta done somethin' right.

222
00:09:03,542 --> 00:09:05,375
- [Brian] There ya go.

223
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,798
- [Ellie] Say, "I'm
gonna sleep good tonight.

224
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,810
"I'm gonna sleep good tonight."

225
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,124
- [Jared] 'Cause you could
gift that and make it go

226
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,314
forever.
- Yeah.

227
00:09:13,314 --> 00:09:15,159
- [Jared] Someone gift that
and make it go forever.

228
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:18,826
(upbeat instrumental music)

229
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,920
- [Ellie] Oh no.

230
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,503
Oh, get 'em better.

231
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,305
You don't look so hot.

232
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:31,152
Gotta get him taken care of.

233
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:32,953
Oh, ooh, did that hurt?

234
00:09:32,953 --> 00:09:34,548
Ooh!

235
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,332
That's double shots!
- He's a tough puppy.

236
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:38,811
He'll be alright,
- Aw.

237
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,375
- he'll make it.
- Aw, yeah,

238
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,767
I would squeal too.

239
00:09:41,767 --> 00:09:43,323
Is he gonna be okay?

240
00:09:43,323 --> 00:09:44,546
- Yeah.

241
00:09:44,546 --> 00:09:46,876
- Oh, feeyoumfth, you'll be okay.

242
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:47,709
(squeals quietly)

243
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:49,374
You just gotta get food in you.

244
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:50,599
And in me,
- Mm hmm.

245
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:51,904
- 'cause I'm starvin'!

246
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:53,825
- I know a lot of Ellies.

247
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,614
I know happy Ellie, I know sad Ellie.

248
00:09:56,614 --> 00:10:00,055
I know crazy Ellie, but
the worst Ellie of all

249
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:01,980
is hangry Ellie.
- Hangry.

250
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,705
I told my mom and dad in the
airport today, I was like,

251
00:10:03,705 --> 00:10:05,475
"Mom, do you have lots of snacks?"

252
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,458
And she's like, "Oh yeah."

253
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,421
I said, "'Cause you don't
want anyone hangry."

254
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:09,529
- Yeah.
- And I looked at dad.

255
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:10,882
(laughs)
That's where I get it from.

256
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:12,074
- Dad is a hangry person too, isn't he?

257
00:10:12,074 --> 00:10:13,915
- Yeah.
- I think everyone has

258
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:15,055
a hangry side.

259
00:10:15,055 --> 00:10:16,116
Missy, can you attest to that?

260
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,177
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah.

261
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,010
- Who's more hangry?

262
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,843
You or Brian?

263
00:10:18,843 --> 00:10:19,841
- Um, me.

264
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:21,148
Wouldn't you say I'm more hangry?

265
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:23,282
When I get hungry, I'm like--
- Um, yeah.

266
00:10:23,282 --> 00:10:26,949
(upbeat instrumental music)

267
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:42,556
(camera shutter clicks)

268
00:10:42,556 --> 00:10:43,389
(camera shutter clicks)

269
00:10:43,389 --> 00:10:46,112
(camera shutter clicks)

270
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:49,779
(upbeat instrumental music)

271
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:09,233
- [Jared] I mean, who doesn't
want a bath at Lush, right?

272
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:11,152
This is the best place to have a bath.

273
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:12,218
♫ I love Lush

274
00:11:12,218 --> 00:11:14,795
- Every time I walk in,
I'm like, "We love Lush."

275
00:11:14,795 --> 00:11:16,392
And everyone's like--

276
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:18,274
I gotta tell 'em how much I love 'em.

277
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:20,087
- [Jared] What color's this one, Jackson?

278
00:11:20,087 --> 00:11:20,920
- Green.

279
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,753
- [Jared] Green, yeah.

280
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:23,715
Does it smell good?

281
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,889
- It smells stinky.

282
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,447
- [Jared] (laughing)
That's the best stinky

283
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,045
I've ever smelled before.

284
00:11:29,045 --> 00:11:31,212
(tapping)

285
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,905
- This is why we said we'll
eat outside (giggles).

286
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,247
Jackson is using his chopsticks.

287
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:38,511
Good job bud.

288
00:11:38,511 --> 00:11:40,604
More like just stabbing it,
but you're gettin' there.

289
00:11:40,604 --> 00:11:41,909
That's awesome.

290
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:42,742
Can you try it?

291
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:45,097
Calvin's been waitin' to try this.

292
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:45,930
Whoa!

293
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,678
- [Brian] Bro, look it,

294
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,249
you got like three
grains of rice on there.

295
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,842
- [Ellie] You're gonna
be so hungry tonight.

296
00:11:52,842 --> 00:11:54,314
No, I'll just grab it with my hand.

297
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:55,252
That's what I do too.

298
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:58,193
If you guys ever come to PF
Chang's, I usually do not like

299
00:11:58,193 --> 00:12:00,405
honey dew, that's what it is?

300
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:02,055
I'm so confused.
- These little melons.

301
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,099
Yeah.
(laughing)

302
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,144
- But it's so good and refreshing.

303
00:12:05,144 --> 00:12:07,804
You have to get this dish if
you ever go to PF Chang's.

304
00:12:07,804 --> 00:12:09,564
You lost your strawberry.

305
00:12:09,564 --> 00:12:10,543
- [Brain] Now you gotta eat it, dude.

306
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:13,186
- [Ellie] All in ketchup.

307
00:12:13,186 --> 00:12:15,108
Are you gonna eat it or no?

308
00:12:15,108 --> 00:12:16,275
- Yes.
- Well?

309
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:18,726
Okay.

310
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:21,826
Yummy!

311
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:26,204
- It was short, but it was sweet.

312
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,352
- [Ellie] It was good to see you.

313
00:12:27,352 --> 00:12:28,994
- Gotta say goodbye to our friends now.

314
00:12:28,994 --> 00:12:32,441
Seriously, I feel like
we jam packed that visit

315
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,709
and don't you guys?

316
00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:34,907
- They're gonna sleep so good!

317
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:35,967
- [Jared] I know!

318
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,074
Look at these guys.

319
00:12:37,074 --> 00:12:38,302
(laughing)

320
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:40,023
My ride home is gonna go so smooth.

321
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,870
(laughing)
- You too?

322
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,219
- [Jared] You boys, look at this.

323
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:46,136
Oh my gosh.

324
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,818
Good job, Calvin.

325
00:12:48,818 --> 00:12:50,401
We gotta go down.

326
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,234
Okay.

327
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:53,326
I will wrangle the kids
and then we'll say goodbye.

328
00:12:53,326 --> 00:12:54,159
- [Ellie] Bye.

329
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,499
- [Jared] Bye.

330
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:56,586
Aw, that's so sweet.

331
00:12:56,586 --> 00:12:57,419
- Bye.

332
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,933
- [Jared] Oh,

333
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:01,916
too cute.

334
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,638
- [Jackson] Calvin, do you love me?

335
00:13:04,638 --> 00:13:06,143
(moans)

336
00:13:06,143 --> 00:13:06,976
Do you love me?

337
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:08,487
(grunts)

338
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,168
- [Jared] I love you, Jackson.

339
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,483
- [Jackson] I love you too.

340
00:13:11,483 --> 00:13:12,466
- [Jared] Thanks bud.

341
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,064
- Why are they treating us
- What is goin' on?

342
00:13:14,064 --> 00:13:17,199
- so good?
- Are you kidding me?

343
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,547
Get out!

344
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,571
Ellie (laughing), look at that.

345
00:13:21,571 --> 00:13:22,817
- [Jackson] It has a guitar.

346
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:26,767
- [Jared] Oh my gosh, are you kidding me?

347
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:28,860
- [Calvin] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

348
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,170
- [Jared] Look at these guys.

349
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,253
- Yeah, yeah.

350
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:34,767
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

351
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,486
The Mecham Family.

352
00:13:36,486 --> 00:13:38,417
Look at that, Ellie.

353
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:40,257
- This is, I'm speechless.

354
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,162
- [Jared] I am too.

355
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,100
- Jackson and Calvin?

356
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,601
- [Jared] No way, it
has their names in that?

357
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:49,406
I can't believe they
have Dr. Pepper there.

358
00:13:49,406 --> 00:13:50,520
I'm gonna have to drink some.

359
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,353
You know that, right?

360
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:52,979
- Look at this whole loft, oh my gosh!

361
00:13:52,979 --> 00:13:54,389
