1
00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:04,003
(upbeat instrumental music)

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,377
- Look, do you see 'em?

3
00:00:05,377 --> 00:00:07,798
That is the biggest Care
Bear I have ever seen, Ellie.

4
00:00:07,798 --> 00:00:10,048
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,188
- [Ellie] Good morning guys.

6
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,789
We are watching the video
for the day, and Calvin,

7
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,247
you're getting dressed in my shirt!

8
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:22,638
That's mine!

9
00:00:22,638 --> 00:00:25,979
- Today, we have the amazing
opportunity to help celebrate

10
00:00:25,979 --> 00:00:28,678
Care Bear's 35th anniversary.

11
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:30,714
That is incredible, so
we're here in Los Angeles

12
00:00:30,714 --> 00:00:33,464
and we're about ready to
go to this huge event.

13
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:35,665
And Care Bears have some
shirts for the kids,

14
00:00:35,665 --> 00:00:36,744
and they have 'em on right now.

15
00:00:36,744 --> 00:00:38,031
So, show me your shirt, bud.

16
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:38,864
Whoa!

17
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:39,939
Is that Tender Heart Bear?

18
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:40,772
- Mm hmm.

19
00:00:40,772 --> 00:00:41,605
- Yeah.

20
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:43,998
This is such a throwback.

21
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:45,661
The color scheme and everything.

22
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,901
Like, I wasn't born in
1982, but it still makes me

23
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,817
feel nostalgic.

24
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:52,113
Don't show us your, we
wanna see your shirt

25
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:54,476
not your belly, silly boy.

26
00:00:54,476 --> 00:00:55,844
Calvin, can we see your shirt?

27
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:59,246
Look at all those Care, not
your belly button silly.

28
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:01,117
Look at all these Care Bears.

29
00:01:01,117 --> 00:01:02,278
- There's Grumpy Bear

30
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:03,111
- [Jared] Yeah.

31
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,891
- and there's Wonder Heart Bear,

32
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,725
- [Jared] Uh huh.

33
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,545
- and there's Rainbow Heart Bear,

34
00:01:07,545 --> 00:01:08,378
- [Jared] Yeah.

35
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:11,444
- and there's uh, what bear is it?

36
00:01:11,444 --> 00:01:12,395
- [Jared] Uh, I can't remember.

37
00:01:12,395 --> 00:01:14,721
I think it was Secret Bear,
but we actually have Rainbow

38
00:01:14,721 --> 00:01:16,011
Heart Bear right here.
- That's cute.

39
00:01:16,011 --> 00:01:18,679
Hey,
- Wasn't that adorable?

40
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,473
- let's go!
- Let's go!

41
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,846
- Hey, you wanna go to Carealot?

42
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:26,038
- I don't know.
- You wanna go--

43
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:28,232
- (laughs) I wonder where
Jackson wants to go.

44
00:01:28,232 --> 00:01:30,065
- You wanna go to Carealot?

45
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:32,732
- I think we're gonna try and
find Carealot today, guys.

46
00:01:32,732 --> 00:01:35,028
(laughing)

47
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:36,200
- [Jackson] Here's Grumpy Bear.

48
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,450
(laughing)

49
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:42,993
- [Jared] Switch their shirts.

50
00:01:42,993 --> 00:01:45,656
♫ Boom boom boom

51
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,812
(laughing)

52
00:01:47,812 --> 00:01:49,556
- Calvin, get out of the toilet.

53
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:52,047
Okay, I can get Calvin out
of the toilet a hundred times

54
00:01:52,047 --> 00:01:52,880
a day.

55
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,665
- You have the sacred
opportunity to carry around

56
00:01:55,665 --> 00:01:56,911
Rainbow Heart Bear.

57
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:59,430
We're taking Rainbow Heart Bear
wherever we go today, okay?

58
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,428
- [Ellie] Okay.

59
00:02:00,428 --> 00:02:01,422
- [Jared] That's our special guest.

60
00:02:01,422 --> 00:02:02,418
- [Ellie] Let's go.

61
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:03,745
- Daddy look.

62
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:07,857
- [Jared] I think you look pretty great.

63
00:02:07,857 --> 00:02:08,771
Oh, there's our elevator.

64
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:10,768
Let's go push the button.

65
00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:12,223
Not the emergency button, Calvin.

66
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:13,421
- [Jared] Yeah, not like last time.

67
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:14,689
- What button is it?

68
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,820
- Let's try the star with the L.

69
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,726
Boop.

70
00:02:17,726 --> 00:02:20,434
Okay, we got a sleepy head already.

71
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:22,216
He is zonked out.

72
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:25,294
We just made it to the mall
and Jackson is just mesmerized

73
00:02:25,294 --> 00:02:26,741
by all of the rocks.

74
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:27,901
Where are all the rocks, bud?

75
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,090
Do you see all of the rocks on the ground?

76
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,446
He's meditating.

77
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:33,374
We're just about to walk
in and there's already

78
00:02:33,374 --> 00:02:35,058
a huge line of you guys.

79
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:36,729
You guys are so cool
for comin' out this far.

80
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,937
This is so amazing.

81
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:39,671
We're so excited to meet every one of you.

82
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:42,573
Jackson, Cheer Bear is
on his way right now.

83
00:02:42,573 --> 00:02:43,638
Did you know that?

84
00:02:43,638 --> 00:02:45,128
Are you so excited?

85
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:46,694
Look at all these guys here.

86
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:47,527
Hi!

87
00:02:48,712 --> 00:02:51,097
Oh my gosh, Jackson, look right there.

88
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:52,578
Look right there!

89
00:02:52,578 --> 00:02:53,614
Look, do you see 'em?

90
00:02:53,614 --> 00:02:54,447
Look!

91
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:56,895
Look at that.

92
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:58,582
Isn't that so cool?

93
00:02:58,582 --> 00:03:02,119
That is the biggest Care
Bear I have ever seen, Ellie.

94
00:03:02,119 --> 00:03:03,286
(laughs)

95
00:03:03,286 --> 00:03:04,392
Look!

96
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,892
That's so amazing.

97
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:09,919
Wow!

98
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:11,380
That is such a big Care Bear.

99
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,297
(laughing)

100
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:14,495
And there is Calvin.

101
00:03:14,495 --> 00:03:17,544
If Calvin wakes up and
sees that giant Care Bear,

102
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,082
what he's gonna think?

103
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:19,915
Hi!

104
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,260
Jackson wants to show
him Rainbow Heart Bear.

105
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,494
Yeah.

106
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:37,044
(happy instrumental music)

107
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,129
Jackson is being such a
good helper giving stickers

108
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:01,700
to all of our friends.

109
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,462
(laughing)

110
00:04:03,462 --> 00:04:04,699
Good job, bud.

111
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:05,736
Say hi!

112
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:06,569
- Hi!
- Hi!

113
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:09,588
- Hello!

114
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:10,657
- Thank you guys so much for comin' out.

115
00:04:10,657 --> 00:04:11,899
This is so fun.

116
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:13,018
Hi sweetie!

117
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,435
Hi! (laughs)

118
00:04:17,434 --> 00:04:19,176
♫ Duh duh dun

119
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,345
♫ Duh duh dun

120
00:04:20,345 --> 00:04:21,285
- [Ellie] He's sleeping
through all of this.

121
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:23,222
♫ Duh duh duh duh duh duh

122
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,055
- [Ellie] It's hilarious.

123
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,426
- [Jared] If you zoom out,
there's like tons of people.

124
00:04:26,426 --> 00:04:28,702
(laughing)

125
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:31,128
- This girl is so cute.

126
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:34,020
She's reminding me of Eve
right now, with her unicorn.

127
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,078
She can't get enough of Care Bear.

128
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,668
So cute.

129
00:04:38,668 --> 00:04:41,882
Calvin just woke up from a
nap and wasn't very happy,

130
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:44,689
of course, because he woke
up from a nap and he saw

131
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:47,456
the Care Bear and he was like,
so happy, which is so funny

132
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:50,250
'cause you'd think most kids
would kinda be a little scared

133
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,612
or something, you know?

134
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:52,678
He loves it.

135
00:04:52,678 --> 00:04:54,997
Where's the Care Bear?

136
00:04:54,997 --> 00:04:58,164
Do you wanna give the Care Bear a hug?

137
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:01,798
So fun.

138
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:04,541
We just finished up
- Woo!

139
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,100
- our Meet Up, which was so fun.

140
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,896
But we are now, we were invited to

141
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,545
Carealot.
- Carealot.

142
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,320
So, the kids are playin'.

143
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,942
Gotta show ya what they're doin'.

144
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:17,525
(happy instrumental music)

145
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:39,908
Now you're a Care Bear!

146
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,927
- [Jared] You're a Care Bear, Jackson.

147
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:45,510
(happy instrumental music)

148
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:02,491
- Woo!

149
00:06:02,491 --> 00:06:04,229
That was unbelievable.

150
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,062
That was awesome.

151
00:06:05,062 --> 00:06:08,229
It was so cool to be a part of that whole

152
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:11,275
Share Your Care Day with Care Bears.

153
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,879
Thank you, Care Bears, for having us.

154
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:14,397
That was so fun.

155
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:18,160
And not only that, we were
able to meet Tori Spelling,

156
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,593
Mario Lopez and his wife, and
so many other cool people.

157
00:06:21,593 --> 00:06:24,173
And the kids had such a
blast in that play area.

158
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:26,861
Did you have fun today?

159
00:06:26,861 --> 00:06:27,694
- Yes.

160
00:06:27,694 --> 00:06:28,925
- [Jared] What was your favorite part?

161
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:31,520
- Bein' in the pit ball.

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,867
- [Jared] Playing with all
those friends in the ball pit?

163
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:34,700
- Yeah.

164
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,533
- Cool.

165
00:06:35,533 --> 00:06:36,785
Well, I've got a great idea, Jackson.

166
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,930
We've had so much fun
today, but I think this

167
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,904
is gonna take the cake.

168
00:06:40,904 --> 00:06:42,095
You know what we're gonna do?

169
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:45,023
- Yeah, we're gonna go swim!

170
00:06:45,023 --> 00:06:46,418
- We're gonna go swimming!

171
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:48,652
Let's go get in the pool
guys, come on, let's go!

172
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,259
Let's get in the pool.

173
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:53,967
(talking gibberish)

174
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,626
- [Ellie] Calvin's just standing here,

175
00:06:55,626 --> 00:07:00,198
lookin' at the cars go by,
playing with the guitar.

176
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:02,098
Like, I wonder what he's
thinking in his little mind,

177
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:05,500
like how high this is,
and if it's scary or--

178
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,715
Like I get dizzy every
time I walk by there.

179
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:10,025
I get dizzy!

180
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:11,640
- Oh, you caught me drinking a Dr. Pepper.

181
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,917
Oh don't worry.
- That's okay.

182
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,526
- This is uh,
- Your first,

183
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:16,556
second Dr. Pepper.

184
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:19,356
- Well, it's my second Dr.
Pepper, and I feel like,

185
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:21,943
I haven't had a Dr. Pepper
since I started working out.

186
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:23,402
It's only been a few days, obviously.

187
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,047
But I would feel bad

188
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:28,281
if I didn't drink these
because the guys at the hotel

189
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,059
and the company went to great
lengths to make this happen.

190
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,967
So, I feel like it would
be a disservice to them

191
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,156
to not drink it.

192
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:35,149
- [Ellie] Well, you didn't say

193
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,547
you weren't drinking Dr. Pepper.

194
00:07:36,547 --> 00:07:37,550
- No, I didn't.
- You're just,

195
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,033
trying to be better.

196
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:39,866
- Yeah.

197
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,699
- [Ellie] I'm happy for you.

198
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:41,532
Let's go.

199
00:07:41,532 --> 00:07:42,956
Don't explain yourself.

200
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:43,789
- I just love it so much.

201
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,062
- You can drink it.

202
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:47,207
Just only like once a week (chuckles).

203
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:50,006
Okay, I think Calvin
won 'cause he's the one

204
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:50,988
that pushed the button.

205
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,584
- [Jared] Oh let's go, this way, this way.

206
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:54,917
- [Ellie] Jackson, come on.

207
00:07:54,917 --> 00:07:55,750
- [Jared] We lost him.

208
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,878
(laughing)

209
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:57,981
- [Ellie] Good daddy.

210
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,247
- Yeah, he's goin' down.

211
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:01,330
(crying)

212
00:08:02,313 --> 00:08:05,070
Don't worry, we'll get 'em.

213
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,896
We are such a (mumbles).

214
00:08:06,896 --> 00:08:09,069
- [Ellie] Calvin ran in as it shut.

215
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:10,869
Hopefully those guys were--

216
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:12,217
- You stay, you stay up here.

217
00:08:12,217 --> 00:08:13,300
I'll go down.

218
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,905
- [Ellie] Nope.

219
00:08:15,905 --> 00:08:16,738
- [Jared] No, not in there?

220
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,308
- No you need to get in there.
- You going down?

221
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:19,141
Oh, we're going down.

222
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:20,126
We're going down.

223
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:23,429
- [Ellie] Our kid just ran down.

224
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:26,671
- [Jared] Yay! (laughing)

225
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:28,059
Hi bud.

226
00:08:28,059 --> 00:08:29,741
- [Man] He was so scared.

227
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:32,352
- [Jared] That was like
the craziest thing ever.

228
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:33,293
You okay?

229
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:34,607
You alright?

230
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:35,440
(laughing)

231
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,446
Thank you guys.

232
00:08:36,446 --> 00:08:38,097
- [Man] You're welcome.
- I'm so sorry about that.

233
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,973
- [Man] High five.

234
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,443
- You too, take care, bye.

235
00:08:41,443 --> 00:08:43,039
That scared me dude.

236
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,652
You literally ran in the
door as it was closing.

237
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:48,156
(laughing)

238
00:08:48,156 --> 00:08:50,684
That was the funniest thing.

239
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,037
Oh my gosh.

240
00:08:52,037 --> 00:08:53,547
Are you okay bud?

241
00:08:53,547 --> 00:08:54,482
You scared us.

242
00:08:54,482 --> 00:08:56,195
You just ran in there
as the door was closing.

243
00:08:56,195 --> 00:08:57,358
We couldn't even get in.

244
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:00,017
(kiss smacks)

245
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:00,999
Hello!

246
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,656
- Calvin!

247
00:09:02,656 --> 00:09:04,544
- I was really like--
- Oh my gosh,

248
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,645
- In case they came back up.

249
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:08,210
Calvin, did you run away again?

250
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,037
- [Jared] Oh my gosh, that was crazy.

251
00:09:10,037 --> 00:09:12,486
- The thing is, is we were
all getting in the elevator.

252
00:09:12,486 --> 00:09:13,319
- [Jared] Yeah.

253
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,520
- Calvin ran in first, and
we were were gonna get in,

254
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,951
Jared's like, "Oh not
that," and then it closed.

255
00:09:15,951 --> 00:09:17,795
- That was going down
and we needed to go up.

256
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,007
- Then it closed, and then the
two guys, and they were like,

257
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:20,840
"Oh no!"

258
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,253
(laughing)

259
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:24,339
Luckily, we're good.
- We're good.

260
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:26,137
Well don't you guys look relaxed?

261
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:28,228
This is the best ever.

262
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:29,371
- [Ellie] Someone just gave us a towel.

263
00:09:29,371 --> 00:09:30,769
That was so nice of them.

264
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,072
- A flamingo!

265
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,624
- [Jared] A flaming-ahahaha.

266
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:34,457
- [Ellie] Flamingo!

267
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:35,827
- [Jared] A flamingo!

268
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:36,771
- [Ellie] Is that so nice of them?

269
00:09:36,771 --> 00:09:37,604
- [Jared] Yeah.

270
00:09:37,604 --> 00:09:38,486
- [Ellie] Say thank you, Jax.

271
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:39,319
- Thank you.

272
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,152
- [Ellie] Oh, look.

273
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:43,126
He's bringing you guys some (mumbles) too!

274
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:44,942
- Here you are buddy.

275
00:09:44,942 --> 00:09:46,864
- Aw, say thank you.
- You want a flamingo?

276
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:49,728
- [Ellie] You guys are gettin'
spoiled left and right.

277
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:51,921
- [Jared] Yeah you are.

278
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,098
- [Ellie] That's so funny.

279
00:09:53,098 --> 00:09:53,931
- [Jared] Thanks guys.

280
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:57,514
(happy instrumental music)

281
00:10:18,328 --> 00:10:21,213
- Calvin, what is up with you?

282
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,523
Daddy and I keep wondering.

283
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:26,543
I think you're goin'
through a big learning,

284
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,615
- Personality.

285
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:29,225
- just everything.
- Change.

286
00:10:29,225 --> 00:10:31,608
- The things that Calvin
does, Jared and I both

287
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:33,303
look at each other and we're like--

288
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:34,633
- Where did that come from?

289
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,716
- He's dancing tons more,

290
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,376
he's brave in the pool.

291
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:40,995
Just like not even,

292
00:10:40,995 --> 00:10:43,383
it's like, he wouldn't
even care if we were there

293
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:44,216
or not.

294
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:45,049
He would jump in.

295
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:48,298
- It's like, he's like
discovering himself.

296
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,965
- You are a handful,

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
to say the least.

298
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,108
(happy instrumental music)

299
00:10:57,108 --> 00:10:59,983
Nothin' like givin' the
kids another lush bath,

300
00:10:59,983 --> 00:11:04,093
watchin' us some TV and
getting some room service.

301
00:11:04,093 --> 00:11:05,705
We have some food here.

302
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:07,762
It smells really good.

303
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,120
I'm very excited for mine.

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,321
It is a stir fry, so that's what I got.

305
00:11:12,321 --> 00:11:14,428
Boys got chicken tenders.

306
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:15,628
I got a salad.

307
00:11:15,628 --> 00:11:16,795
Yummy.
- Yeah!

308
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,131
- [Ellie] Woo hoo, are you excited to eat?

309
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:20,036
- Yes.

310
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:22,018
- [Ellie] This is so fun.

311
00:11:22,018 --> 00:11:22,851
- I'm a shark.

312
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:23,684
- You're a shark?

313
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:24,517
(yells)

314
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,517
(yells)

315
00:11:27,537 --> 00:11:30,014
- Not my wife, not my wife!

316
00:11:30,014 --> 00:11:32,409
(grunts)

317
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:35,168
(Calvin yells)

318
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,697
- [Calvin] Dad!

319
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:37,530
Dad!

320
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,049
- Yes?

321
00:11:40,049 --> 00:11:40,980
(Jackson yells)

322
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,510
- [Ellie] I'm mama shark and I always win.

323
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,059
(growls)

324
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,633
Okay, let's eat.
- Let's eat?

325
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:49,029
- [Ellie] Let's eat.

326
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:50,608
(boys yelling)

327
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:52,587
We're kind of wild animals in here.

328
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:53,420
- I love it though.

329
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,566
I like your Care Bears onesie.

330
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,399
- Thank you.

331
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,232
- Miss Cheer Bear.

332
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,065
- I like it too.

333
00:11:57,065 --> 00:11:59,625

- Yes, it was so fun.

339
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:13,249
- Even with our kids kind of
running wild for a minute.

340
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:14,082
(laughing)

341
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:14,915

00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,756
fly on a plane tomorrow.
- Is it weird

362
00:12:51,756 --> 00:12:53,737
that we're gonna go to
bed before the kids?

363
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:54,986
I'm like,
- Oh my gosh.

364
00:12:54,986 --> 00:12:56,218
- "Kids," (mumbles).
- I know.

365
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:58,385
- We're gonna fall asleep.

366
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:00,679
Calvin can't open that door.

367
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,709
(laughing)
- I was just gonna say,

368
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,404
we can't fall asleep 'cause
Calvin is gonna cause

369
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:05,764
too much mischief.
- No, he doesn't know

370
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:06,631
how to open that door.

371
00:13:06,631 --> 00:13:07,464
We're good.

372
00:13:07,464 --> 00:13:08,462
(laughing)

373
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:09,295
- Thanks for watching, guys.

374
00:13:09,295 --> 00:13:10,347
We will see you tomorrow.

375
00:13:10,347 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
- Bye!
