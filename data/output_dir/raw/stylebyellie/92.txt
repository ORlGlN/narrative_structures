1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,654
- You ready to do this?

2
00:00:01,654 --> 00:00:04,940
- Now it's the end of the
busiest, craziest week.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,246
- I know, it's been--
- Emotions.

4
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:10,240
- It's been an incredible
week, full of emotion.

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,983
I think back to when we
were sitting here last year.

6
00:00:14,983 --> 00:00:18,534
We went from one grant
and then that turned

7
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:22,701
into five grants, and then
that turned into seven grants.

8
00:00:23,558 --> 00:00:27,725
This year we feel so blessed
to have four grants this year.

9
00:00:28,676 --> 00:00:31,766
Thanks to the incredible
donations of Zach from

10
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:34,516
JerryRigEverything, yeah you can,

11
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:39,850
the University of Utah, and
the Utah Fertility Center.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,519
We started doing this because
we wanted to give back

13
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:46,865
for all of the incredible
things that we have receive.

14
00:00:46,865 --> 00:00:49,609
This is just one way of giving back.

15
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,586
I'm glad that we're able
to do it for a second year.

16
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,088
I don't know how long
we'll be able to do this.

17
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:56,671
But as long as we can, we will.

18
00:00:57,538 --> 00:01:01,518
It's exciting that we get to
announce today the winners

19
00:01:01,518 --> 00:01:02,935
of the IVF Grant.

20
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:08,296
- [Brad] Hi, Ellie and Jared.

21
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,044
We're Brad and Courtney from (muffled).

22
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:11,406
We've been together for 17 years,

23
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:12,856
married for the last seven.

24
00:01:12,856 --> 00:01:14,459
- [Courtney] Today we're
filming our IVF video

25
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:16,395
from the lobby of the
hospital where I work.

26
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,788
For the past 10 years
I've been a NICU nurse

27
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:20,609
and three nights a week
I get to work deliveries

28
00:01:20,609 --> 00:01:22,773
to help families bring
their babies into the world.

29
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:24,996
I also get to take care
of the tiniest miracles

30
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:26,748
who are fighting day in and day out

31
00:01:26,748 --> 00:01:29,608
just so they can go home.

32
00:01:29,608 --> 00:01:30,795
- Hi, I'm Amanda.

33
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:31,850
- And I'm Brandon.

34
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,549
We're from Jacksonville, Alabama.

35
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:34,976
After two years of trying to conceive,

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,016
Amanda was diagnosed with
PCOS and low ovarian reserve

37
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,132
and I had some other malefactory issues.

38
00:01:41,132 --> 00:01:42,923
- [Amanda] After the
fourth failed IUI we met

39
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:44,213
with our doctor again.

40
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:47,690
Her recommendation was to move to IVF.

41
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,386
- [Miles] My name is Miles
and this is my beautiful

42
00:01:49,386 --> 00:01:50,921
wife Jessica.

43
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,173
- About halfway through
one of my IUI attempts

44
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:57,523
I woke up one morning
actually partially blind.

45
00:01:57,523 --> 00:02:00,254
I couldn't see, but after
a couple weeks of tests

46
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:03,489
I was actually diagnosed
with Multiple Sclerosis.

47
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,116
- My name's Mike and this is my wife Abby.

48
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:08,519
We've been married for almost 11 years.

49
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:10,949
We participated in foster
care, had four kids come

50
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,266
through our house.

51
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,789
None of it's kind of set
or settled in the way

52
00:02:14,789 --> 00:02:17,922
that we thought it should
be or that we had planned

53
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:21,254
or even that we thought
the Lord would have it be.

54
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,390
- Okay it is just about time.

55
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,588
We are going to make a
phone call or a Skype call

56
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,410
to the very first couple
that we are making

57
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,826
this announcement to.

58
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:33,306
I am just so excited to do this.

59
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,783
This is the best part
about doing these grants

60
00:02:35,783 --> 00:02:38,009
is letting them know.

61
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,926
(voice is muffled)

62
00:02:43,804 --> 00:02:44,672
- Hi.

63
00:02:44,672 --> 00:02:46,045
- Hi guys, how are you?

64
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,148
- Good, how are you?

65
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:50,725
- Good, we did have a
question that we wanted to get

66
00:02:50,725 --> 00:02:52,417
some additional information.

67
00:02:52,417 --> 00:02:53,978
But the real reason that
we called is that we want

68
00:02:53,978 --> 00:02:57,391
to let you know that you guys won a grant.

69
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:58,308
- No.
- Yes.

70
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:05,748
Congratulations guys.

71
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,758
We also wanted to let you
guys know that we have

72
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,620
chosen you as one of the grant winners.

73
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,448
- Thank you.

74
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:14,571
(laughing)

75
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:16,071
- Congratulations!

76
00:03:16,924 --> 00:03:18,964
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

77
00:03:18,964 --> 00:03:20,899
- Most of the reason
that we wanted to call is

78
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,563
we wanted to let you
know that we have chosen

79
00:03:22,563 --> 00:03:24,980
you guys to be grant winners.

80
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,533
(laughing)

81
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,511
The main reason that we
wanted to call is we wanted

82
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:35,479
to let you guys know that
you were selected to be

83
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,979
IVF Grant winners.

84
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:40,367
- Thank you so much!
- Thank you so much.

85
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,892
- [Jared] You are so welcome guys.

86
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:44,809
- And you are so deserving of this.

87
00:03:46,688 --> 00:03:49,482
It was so fun telling them.

88
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:53,649
This has been a crazy and
I feel like I don't know.

89
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:59,369
I hope people understand
the process and know

90
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:02,713
how crazy it is for everyone
that submitted their stories.

91
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:06,463
It's like are we even
equipped to doing this?

92
00:04:08,955 --> 00:04:13,877
Hearing everybody's stories
this week, we laughed with you,

93
00:04:13,877 --> 00:04:15,223
we cried with you.

94
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:16,911
It changes us.

95
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,464
- Absolutely.

96
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:22,306
Who would have thought that
two minutes you could say

97
00:04:22,306 --> 00:04:26,759
so much and sometimes
just seeing your eyes,

98
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,676
you would feel so much?

99
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:34,384
And in a happy, positive
way and a sad, you just want

100
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:36,301
to hug that person way.

101
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:42,531
Just this full range of
emotions that we experienced.

102
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:45,424
We feel so much closer
to you as a community

103
00:04:45,424 --> 00:04:46,633
because of this.

104
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,588
- We've been filming for four years.

105
00:04:49,588 --> 00:04:52,561
There are still days where we
don't know what we're doing.

106
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:54,160
There are still days
where I turn on the camera

107
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,379
and I don't even know what to say.

108
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,463
Sometimes I'm awkward still.

109
00:05:00,463 --> 00:05:04,215
We're just all growing, but
this experience has truly

110
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:06,215
just been an eye opener.

111
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,005
It's weird because there's
so many people that watch us

112
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,902
that are strangers, and there's
so many people that watch us

113
00:05:12,902 --> 00:05:15,482
that are not strangers
that know us personally,

114
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,991
neighbors, everything.

115
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:20,373
Sometimes I'm like I don't know,

116
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:21,814
I feel a little funny sometimes,

117
00:05:21,814 --> 00:05:25,474
but I'm just grateful that
this is what we've been able

118
00:05:25,474 --> 00:05:28,657
to do with our platform
that we never even thought

119
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:30,907
would turn into a platform.

120
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:33,842
It's crazy.

121
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:37,925
- I just feel like you
said we have this platform

122
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:42,354
and if we didn't take the
opportunity to do good,

123
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:46,172
even just a little bit, we
wouldn't be utilizing it

124
00:05:46,172 --> 00:05:48,089
the way that we should.

125
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:53,088
Whether that's donating to Toys for Tots

126
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:57,088
or doing this IVF Grant,
I feel like this is now

127
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:02,664
a part of who we are and
I'm so grateful for it.

128
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,390
It's just been wonderful.

129
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,547
We are really appreciative
of our family this week.

130
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,411
This has been a wonderful
experience, but it has put

131
00:06:11,411 --> 00:06:14,746
a crazy weight on our shoulders.

132
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:18,170
I hope that everyone
around us has understood

133
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,837
our shortcomings and
our lack of being there

134
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,273
it's been a crazy week.

135
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:29,329
Anyway, I'm gonna stop
boobing, but we're just really

136
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:31,815
grateful for our family that supported us

137
00:06:31,815 --> 00:06:34,815
and has understood just the process.

138
00:06:36,673 --> 00:06:38,387
- Yeah, because it does
take a lot of time.

139
00:06:38,387 --> 00:06:40,734
I mean hundreds and
hundreds of people applied

140
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:43,140
and we watched hundreds
and hundreds of videos.

141
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,375
- And all of your stories
resonated with us.

142
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:48,082
I hope that nobody goes
away from this regretting

143
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:50,600
sharing their story with us.

144
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,346
I hope nobody goes away from this.

145
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:56,426
Of course they are going
to go away from it sad.

146
00:06:56,426 --> 00:06:57,334
How can you not?

147
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,345
Even we are.

148
00:06:58,345 --> 00:07:00,923
We kept saying oh I wish
there could have been more.

149
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:04,090
I wish there could have been 100 more.

150
00:07:05,095 --> 00:07:07,207
- I wish we could give a grant to everyone

151
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:11,427
because I said before the
hardest part about this

152
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:15,166
is that everyone is deserving of this.

153
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:16,896
But also the easiest part is that everyone

154
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,929
is deserving of this.

155
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:22,348
I just wish that we had
the capacity to do more,

156
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:23,819
to give more.

157
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,691
I know there's going to
be a lot of people who are

158
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:28,484
so broken-hearted about this.

159
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:31,089
But you know every year
we try harder and we try

160
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,830
to do more.

161
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,468
- We're so grateful for
everybody, even the videos.

162
00:07:35,468 --> 00:07:37,784
It's like we don't deserve
this just as anyone else,

163
00:07:37,784 --> 00:07:39,556
so good luck in your decision making.

164
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:40,964
Everyone said that.

165
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:42,471
- I can't believe how
many people said that.

166
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,298
- And how thoughtful that was and caring.

167
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:47,271
So we appreciate everybody's
kind words towards us.

168
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:50,188
- It just goes to show
how good people are.

169
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:52,271
I'm so grateful for that.

170
00:07:53,118 --> 00:07:55,701
So with that there you have it.

171
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,703
The IVF Grant winners.

172
00:07:58,703 --> 00:08:00,484
Thank you for another wonderful year.

173
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,405
This is going to be an
incredible journey for those

174
00:08:02,405 --> 00:08:04,498
four lucky couples.

175
00:08:04,498 --> 00:08:07,734
We're going to get to know
