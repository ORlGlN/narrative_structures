1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,299
- Yeah.
- Woo!

2
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:02,496
(bright music)

3
00:00:02,496 --> 00:00:04,018
- Of course, we walk
into the movie theater

4
00:00:04,018 --> 00:00:06,589
and we have trouble as
soon as we get in here.

5
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,501
- There is a baby in Mommy's tummy.

6
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:10,005
- How do you feel about that?

7
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,512
- It's weird that we're talking about it.

8
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,504
(laughing)

9
00:00:13,504 --> 00:00:15,254
- You got me so good!

10
00:00:17,744 --> 00:00:19,436
- Fresh strawberries in your oatmeal

11
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,076
in the morning is the best.

12
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:23,061
I love it.

13
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:27,108
I also love, seeing my cute
boys next to the fireplace.

14
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:28,435
- Is the fireplace warm?

15
00:00:28,435 --> 00:00:29,358
- [Ellie] Hi cuties.

16
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:30,191
Jared's like don't film me,

17
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:31,222
I don't have a shirt on.

18
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:33,302
- I don't have a shirt on.

19
00:00:33,302 --> 00:00:34,894
- [Ellie] How many times have
you come in and filmed me,

20
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:36,279
and I'm like Jared.

21
00:00:36,279 --> 00:00:39,237
- Um probably a lot more than
you've done that to me, so.

22
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:40,218
(laughing)

23
00:00:40,218 --> 00:00:41,673
- You're cute.
- Fine.

24
00:00:41,673 --> 00:00:44,205
- [Ellie] Jackson, what
are we doing today?

25
00:00:44,205 --> 00:00:46,494
- We're going to the movie theater.

26
00:00:46,494 --> 00:00:47,327
- Yay.

27
00:00:47,327 --> 00:00:48,866
What are we gonna see?

28
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:49,764
- A movie.

29
00:00:49,764 --> 00:00:50,597
- Oh good.

30
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:51,718
(laughing)

31
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,617
- Alright does anyone out there,

32
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:55,483
especially people that have dogs,

33
00:00:55,483 --> 00:00:59,078
feel like they need more than one vacuum.

34
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:00,624
I think I've even talked
about this before,

35
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:02,388
but I am like, okay,

36
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:05,096
so I cleaned our vacuum today

37
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:08,161
and I usually clean it like once month,

38
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,279
this is the filter,

39
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:10,632
and I just rinse it out and then I clean.

40
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:13,599
Half of it is like the kids,

41
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,232
you know, cleaning up messes.

42
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:19,682
The other day, they decided
to play in the Nesquik

43
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:23,392
mixer stuff, so like this
was full of chocolate stuff.

44
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:25,626
I had to clean it, and it was gross.

45
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:26,769
And especially with Penny,

46
00:01:26,769 --> 00:01:28,817
I feel like it's important
to clean the filter

47
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:30,004
and to clean the hair out,

48
00:01:30,004 --> 00:01:32,814
so I have a clean vacuum
while I'm cleaning.

49
00:01:32,814 --> 00:01:36,160
Anyway, and now I'm like, I need a vacuum,

50
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,004
(laughs)

51
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,033
for like the kids' breakfast this morning,

52
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,705
there's stuff everywhere.

53
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:42,380
But that takes 24 hours to dry,

54
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,797
so I'm like hmmm.

55
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:47,027
Anyway, that's something
I always think about,

56
00:01:47,027 --> 00:01:49,107
I'm like I swear I need another vacuum,

57
00:01:49,107 --> 00:01:51,468
but I think that sounds like crazy.

58
00:01:51,468 --> 00:01:53,317
But it's not, because I would use it.

59
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:55,055
Anyway, we are getting ready for the day.

60
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,271
We're getting things cleaned up.

61
00:01:56,271 --> 00:01:59,296
Jared's working, Penny's
chewing on a chew toy.

62
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,463
- Wow wow wow.

63
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:04,291
- Kids are playing in the window sill.

64
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,708
What are you guys talking about?

65
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,875
- Bow wow wow.

66
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,565
Watch, see?

67
00:02:10,566 --> 00:02:11,475
(scrambling cars)
(vroom vrooming)

68
00:02:11,475 --> 00:02:12,932
- [Ellie] Oh,

69
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:14,857
(Ellie laughs)

70
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,632
Did you hit your head?

71
00:02:16,632 --> 00:02:17,500
(vroom vrooming)
(scrambing cars)

72
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,935
Careful.

73
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:21,268
Look at his shirt, everyone.

74
00:02:22,377 --> 00:02:23,210
- Me.

75
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,330
- [Ellie] That was Jackson's last year.

76
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:27,424
All of Jackson's sweaters last year

77
00:02:27,424 --> 00:02:29,632
are fitting Calvin.

78
00:02:29,632 --> 00:02:31,049
It's a 3T mister.

79
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,483
That looks good.

80
00:02:34,508 --> 00:02:35,341
- Now I'm too big.

81
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:37,529
- [Ellie] And now you're too big.

82
00:02:37,529 --> 00:02:41,532
Good grief, why did you decide to grow up?

83
00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:42,974
What?
(Calvin fusses)

84
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:45,154
You don't like your brother's shirt?

85
00:02:45,154 --> 00:02:46,464
- Ow.
(cries)

86
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:47,833
- [Ellie] He wants to pull it up.

87
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,052
This is a shirt you don't pull up,

88
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:50,606
don't pull at that please.

89
00:02:50,606 --> 00:02:51,439
- Why?

90
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,079
- [Ellie] Because it'll break it.

91
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:55,607
You don't want to break it.

92
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:56,774
Yeah, be soft.

93
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,641
- Are those the pine cones?

94
00:02:59,641 --> 00:03:01,781
- [Ellie] Yeah, 'cause, don't break it.

95
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,638
You guys have your toys

96
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:04,340
and if Mommy were to take your cars,

97
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,364
yeah you be soft,

98
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:07,803
and throw one, that would break your cars.

99
00:03:07,803 --> 00:03:09,419
I don't want you to break Mom's stuff,

100
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:11,433
'cause that wouldn't be nice.

101
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,962
- If you break my stuff,

102
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:16,075
I will be angry.

103
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:19,284
- Yeah and if you break
my stuff, I'll be angry.

104
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:22,099
So let's just not break
each other's stuff, okay?

105
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:23,675
Perfect.

106
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:25,187
Thank you.

107
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:27,505
I thought you looked
really cool in that shirt.

108
00:03:27,505 --> 00:03:29,172
- We break monsters.

109
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:31,801
- [Ellie] We what?

110
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:32,760
- We break monsters.

111
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,097
- [Ellie] We break monsters?

112
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:34,930
- Yeah.

113
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,304
- That sounds like a great idea.

114
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,889
Tell monsters not to come in my house?

115
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:39,722
- No.

116
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:40,555
- [Ellie] Yeah.

117
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:43,600
We only have happy
monsters here, like him.

118
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,093
(Ellie laughs)

119
00:03:45,093 --> 00:03:45,926
Huh?

120
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,508
- Yes, I agree with whatever you said.

121
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,372
I don't know what it is, but I agree.

122
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:53,071
- Hi Miss Penny, good morning.

123
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:55,276
- Mommy baby, Mommy Mommy.

124
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,290
- What?

125
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,115
- Baby it's home.

126
00:03:58,115 --> 00:03:59,949
- Our baby's in my tummy.

127
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,392
- No, this Mommy baby home.

128
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,155
- [Jared] Mommy baby home.

129
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:05,988
- No, this Mommy hold.

130
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,913
- Mommy hold the baby?

131
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:10,031
- Uh-huh.

132
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:11,308
- [Jared] Yeah.

133
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:12,286
(Calvin vocalizing)

134
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,860
- Are you my baby too?

135
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,760
- Yeah.

136
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,593
- [Ellie] Yeah.

137
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:17,257
- [Jared] Does Mommy have another baby?

138
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,813
- No it's Dad's baby.

139
00:04:18,814 --> 00:04:20,148
- Dad's baby.
- Dad's baby.

140
00:04:20,148 --> 00:04:21,231
(laughing)

141
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:23,512
- Okay, I know Dad's
packing on a few pounds,

142
00:04:23,512 --> 00:04:24,778
but that's a little too far Calvin.

143
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:25,620
- [Ellie] That's hilarious.

144
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,466
Let's go.

145
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,549
- Yeah.
- Woo!

146
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,558
- I did finally let
the cat out of the bag,

147
00:04:30,558 --> 00:04:32,234
that you guys know.

148
00:04:32,234 --> 00:04:33,647
- It's weird to talk about.
- This is so exciting.

149
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,697
- I know it's weird to have the vlog out

150
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:36,580
and I guess to talk about it.

151
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,935
- Like look at my tummy right now.

152
00:04:37,935 --> 00:04:38,954
- [Jared] Oh my goodness Ellie.

153
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:40,034
(laughing)

154
00:04:40,034 --> 00:04:41,272
Oh my goodness gracious.

155
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,273
- This is the first day
I'm wearing maternity pants

156
00:04:43,273 --> 00:04:44,304
and it's really really early,

157
00:04:44,304 --> 00:04:45,887
but it's only because I want to be comfy

158
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:47,065
- [Jackson] Yeah!

159
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:48,135
- all the time.

160
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:49,375
- [Jared] Oh I don't blame you one bit.

161
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,722
- I don't want any restrictions anywhere.

162
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:53,304
- Of course we walk into the movie theater

163
00:04:53,304 --> 00:04:55,795
and we have trouble as
soon as we get in here.

164
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:56,628
- Ellie and Jared.

165
00:04:56,628 --> 00:04:58,788
- [Jared] Oh, we've got trouble makers,

166
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,677
troublemakers at the movie theater.

167
00:05:00,677 --> 00:05:01,510
- Jackson!

168
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,515
- Yeah!

169
00:05:02,515 --> 00:05:03,611
(Jared laughs)

170
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,444
- [Jared] You guys excited?

171
00:05:04,444 --> 00:05:05,452
- Guess what we're watching?

172
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,285
- What?

173
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:08,019
- A skeleton movie.
- Coco.

174
00:05:08,019 --> 00:05:09,354
- See that, see that on the movie--

175
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:11,655
- [Jared] Okay, are you
guys ready for this?

176
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:13,139
- We are, yeah and it was hilarious.

177
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:13,972
(laughs)

178
00:05:13,972 --> 00:05:15,081
- [Jared] Let me see your picture.

179
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,311
- Jackson's the only one--

180
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:18,089
- [Bonnie] Jackson, I'm
gonna take your picture.

181
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:20,839
- [Jared] Oh look at Cody's face.

182
00:05:21,994 --> 00:05:24,661
(soaring music)

183
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,259
(Jared laughs)

184
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:38,094
I'm spilling all the popcorn.

185
00:05:38,094 --> 00:05:42,192
Well we had one person
not quite make it through.

186
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,680
- Thank goodness.

187
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,922
I was like, we are gonna take you out,

188
00:05:44,922 --> 00:05:46,706
and then he fell asleep.

189
00:05:46,706 --> 00:05:48,425
- [Jared] He is so zonked out.

190
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,118
He made it about halfway through.

191
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:52,584
Okay boys, let's wait over
here by the door, okay?

192
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:53,417
Right over here.

193
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,702
We made it back from the movie.

194
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:56,124
I loved it.

195
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,733
I really really liked it.

196
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,412
Oh we're walking in the dark now.

197
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:00,607
Let's flip that switch.

198
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:01,999
Ellie, what'd you think of the movie?

199
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,351
- It was a cute story.

200
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,205
- [Jared] It was.

201
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:06,383
- Did you like it Cal?

202
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:08,017
- [Jared] Yeah, you kind
of missed the whole part--

203
00:06:08,017 --> 00:06:09,722
- It was kind of bad timing.

204
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:10,555
- [Jared] Yeah.

205
00:06:10,555 --> 00:06:11,388
(Jared laughs)

206
00:06:11,388 --> 00:06:12,221
- It was fun.

207
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:14,495
- It was really cute, the
music was really great.

208
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:15,904
I do have one complaint.

209
00:06:15,904 --> 00:06:17,312
It's not really a valid complaint,

210
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:18,736
but I'm gonna do it.

211
00:06:18,736 --> 00:06:21,806
The whole, every time
Disney Pixar has a movie,

212
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,191
they have a short beforehand.

213
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:26,079
It was like a Frozen one,

214
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,169
and it was like a little two long.

215
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:31,824
- I'm sorry Frozen, it was
like a 30 minute Frozen film.

216
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,448
- Yeah and so usually they have
like these really short ones

217
00:06:35,448 --> 00:06:37,198
that are perfect and cute and fun.

218
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:39,447
This was cute, a little too long,

219
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:41,812
You know, just for the
kids, in my opinion.

220
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:45,783
Anyway, speaking of kids, what
are you guys doing down here?

221
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,524
(yelling)
(banging on box)

222
00:06:47,524 --> 00:06:49,270
(laughing)

223
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,331
There's something in this box

224
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:53,060
and I'm afraid to see what it is.

225
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,946
Should we see what's inside?

226
00:06:55,946 --> 00:06:58,254
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

227
00:06:58,254 --> 00:07:01,200
What is inside of the box?

228
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,624
It's Cody.

229
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:03,606
(Jared laughs)

230
00:07:03,606 --> 00:07:05,689
- I kept hitting my head.

231
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:09,515
- [Jared] Gosh, who
needs all of these toys,

232
00:07:09,515 --> 00:07:11,259
when you have a box, right?

233
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:12,092
- So when we were at the theaters,

234
00:07:12,092 --> 00:07:15,088
we got notification on
our security system,

235
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:17,184
and I was like who is at our house,

236
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:19,080
like the security is on.

237
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,927
There's a cat outside.

238
00:07:20,927 --> 00:07:22,827
There's a cat outside.

239
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:25,188
Jared we should let Penny outside.

240
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:26,021
(Ellie laughs)

241
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:28,082
But now the cat's probably gonna run.

242
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:31,109
- Come on Penny, let's go outside.

243
00:07:31,109 --> 00:07:33,776
- [Ellie] Oop it's on the rocks.

244
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:35,989
(Ellie laughs)

245
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,092
Penny.

246
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:38,817
- Did you see it jump over the fence?

247
00:07:38,817 --> 00:07:39,650
- Yeah.

248
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,339
(Ellie laughs)

249
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,269
She missed it.

250
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:46,000
Anyway, we got an alarm,

251
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,959
and I was like, what the heck,

252
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,352
and Jared was like, oh it's Mom and Dad,

253
00:07:49,352 --> 00:07:51,005
I'm like, oh, wonder what they're doing.

254
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:54,483
I noticed, so last year
Jared's mom made this for me,

255
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:57,459
and then I noticed that
this was sitting under it.

256
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:00,107
She totally bought me a runner.

257
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:00,940
- [Jared] Isn't that cute?

258
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,447
- That is so cute.

259
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,431
She went to Freckle Farm,

260
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,597
and I told her she has to go there,

261
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:05,894
because she would love it.

262
00:08:05,894 --> 00:08:07,838
And I'm pretty sure this
is where she got it.

263
00:08:07,838 --> 00:08:09,271
It's so cute, thank you.

264
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:10,984
We need to call you and
officially say thank you,

265
00:08:10,984 --> 00:08:12,521
but thank you to the vlogs.

266
00:08:12,521 --> 00:08:13,354
- Crap!

267
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:14,972
Pull the camera out before you guys leave,

268
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:16,634
Hold on, don't leave yet.

269
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:17,779
Don't leave yet guys.

270
00:08:17,779 --> 00:08:20,224
Hi, I said don't go out the door.

271
00:08:20,224 --> 00:08:21,878
Linc?

272
00:08:21,878 --> 00:08:25,080
Everyone come back inside,
we need to have fun.

273
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,630
- [Bonnie] It's a party
'til we walk out the door.

274
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,253
- We didn't pick up the camera once.

275
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:30,972
Bonnie and Joel and the
kids have all been here

276
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:31,805
and we've been partying,

277
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,316
so I want you guys to use your imagination

278
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:34,614
and just pretend like you were there,

279
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:36,659
while we were there,
doing that kind of stuff.

280
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,491
You know what I'm saying?

281
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,574
- Fun was had by all.

282
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:39,582
- How many times did our cousins leave,

283
00:08:39,582 --> 00:08:41,112
and we jumped in the back of the car,

284
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:42,971
so we could go spend the night with them.

285
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:43,804
- [Jared] Ooh.

286
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:45,652
- And Jackson just left.
- A few.

287
00:08:45,652 --> 00:08:47,872
- [Jared] Is he jumping
in the back of the pickup?

288
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,532
- He's crawling down the stairs.

289
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:51,978
- [Jared] Oh gee boys, hey,

290
00:08:51,978 --> 00:08:52,811
- [Ellie] Jackson.

291
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,380
- [Jared] Hey, don't you get in the truck.

292
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,621
Oh that is exactly what he is doing.

293
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:58,454
(Jared laughs)

294
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,287
Go get him Mom.

295
00:08:59,287 --> 00:09:00,120
Oh no.

296
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,667
Mom's faster than you.

297
00:09:05,082 --> 00:09:07,761
Hey, what do you think
of our Christmas lights?

298
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,594
- [Joel] It's very nice.

299
00:09:08,594 --> 00:09:09,594
- [Jared] Very nice?

300
00:09:09,594 --> 00:09:10,914
- [Olivia] Oh and I scared
you when we first came.

301
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,567
- Oh my gosh, I'll see if I
can grab the footage of that.

302
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:16,168
Olivia scared me so bad when she came.

303
00:09:16,168 --> 00:09:17,979
She totally ding dong pranked me.

304
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:19,249
It was so funny.

305
00:09:19,249 --> 00:09:22,916
(playful suspenseful music)

306
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:42,561
(Jared yells)

307
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:46,009
(Jared laughing)

308
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:47,759
- You got me so good.

309
00:09:50,337 --> 00:09:52,625
But we got the Christmas lights.

310
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,921
They're natural daylight blue,

311
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,097
versus the warm yellow.

312
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:57,930
Or something like that.

313
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,155
I don't know, I like 'em a lot.

314
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:00,321
You can see 'em in my office window too.

315
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:01,596
- [Olivia] Can I have a hug?

316
00:10:01,596 --> 00:10:04,762
- Absolutely, thanks for
coming over sister sue.

317
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:06,262
Bye Bon, bye guys.

318
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,363
Adios muchachos.

319
00:10:11,549 --> 00:10:13,128
Hey guys,

320
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,486
♪ Remember me ♪

321
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:17,470
That's one of the songs from Coco.

322
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,345
- [Bonnie] Bye.

323
00:10:18,345 --> 00:10:19,178
- Bye.

324
00:10:20,698 --> 00:10:22,618
Coco was actually a really good movie.

325
00:10:22,618 --> 00:10:25,771
It brought tears to my
eyes, it really did.

326
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:27,146
Hey pregnant lady, how are you feeling?

327
00:10:27,146 --> 00:10:28,164
- Hi.

328
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:29,395
- [Jared] Can you believe
we're talking about it?

329
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:30,228
- It's weird.

330
00:10:30,228 --> 00:10:31,256
- It's so weird.

331
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,647
We haven't been talking
about it for like a month,

332
00:10:33,647 --> 00:10:35,400
and now it's out in the open.

333
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,630
How are you feeling pregnant lady?

334
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,284
(Penny barking)

335
00:10:38,284 --> 00:10:39,567
- Penny wants to come in.

336
00:10:39,567 --> 00:10:42,586
Jackson's ready for second dinner.

337
00:10:42,586 --> 00:10:44,486
I'm pooped, because I just chased Jackson

338
00:10:44,486 --> 00:10:46,504
through the neighborhood.
- I know.

339
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:47,344
- I want this open.

340
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:49,618
- [Jared] You know what buddy,
that's actually not yogurt,

341
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:52,207
that's sour cream and
it would not taste good.

342
00:10:52,207 --> 00:10:54,885
- Uncle Beau doesn't like sour cream.

343
00:10:54,885 --> 00:10:56,726
- Daddy doesn't really like sour cream.

344
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:58,656
Would sour cream be bad,

345
00:10:58,656 --> 00:11:01,076
as a non connoisseur of sour cream,

346
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:04,741
would taking a spoonful of
sour cream be bad to eat?

347
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:05,626
- That's--

348
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:06,459
- That's kind of gross.

349
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,738
It's like mayonnaise, right?

350
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,197
You just don't eat a
spoonful of mayonnaise,

351
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:11,030
most people don't anyway.

352
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,307
- Alright, let's get these kids to bed.

353
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:13,140
- Alright.

354
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,973
Hi buddy.

355
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:14,806
- Hi.

356
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:15,639
- Did you have a good day today?

357
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,472
- Yeah.

358
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:18,825
- Good, what was your
favorite part about the day?

359
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,481
- Doing the movie theater.

360
00:11:20,481 --> 00:11:21,721
- That was fun, huh?

361
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:22,554
- Mmm-hmm.

362
00:11:22,554 --> 00:11:24,852
- Hey, do you remember
what we did this morning?

363
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:25,932
- Mmm.

364
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:27,460
- Did you remember when Mommy and Daddy

365
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,402
sat you down on the couch?

366
00:11:29,402 --> 00:11:30,235
- Yeah.

367
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,954
- What did we tell you?

368
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:33,970
- There is a baby in Mommy's tummy.

369
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,394
- How do you feel about that?

370
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,321
- I don't know.

371
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,497
- Are you excited?

372
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:38,330
- Mmm-hmm.

373
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:40,953
- Are you excited to have
a brother or a sister?

374
00:11:40,953 --> 00:11:42,888
(laughs)

375
00:11:42,888 --> 00:11:45,625
Good I'm so happy that you're excited.

376
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:48,696
You have been such a good
big brother for Calvin

377
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:51,228
and I know you're gonna
be a good big brother

378
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,336
for our next baby.
- Yeah.

379
00:11:53,336 --> 00:11:54,169
- I love you buddy.

380
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,315
- I love you.

381
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,842
- Do you want a brother or sister?

382
00:11:56,842 --> 00:11:57,675
- Brother.

383
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,508
- Brother?

384
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:01,138
Uncle Matt says he thinks
we're gonna have a boy too.

385
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,984
- He already has a boy.

386
00:12:02,984 --> 00:12:04,601
- He has three boys.

387
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:06,640
Do you know they're gonna have a baby too?

388
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,473
- Yeah.

389
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,598
- And Aunt Jen is gonna have a baby.

390
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,820
And Aunt Emily is gonna have a baby.

391
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,912
And our other Aunt
Emily's gonna have a baby.

392
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:15,581
And Aunt Julie's gonna have a baby.

393
00:12:15,581 --> 00:12:17,697
There's a lot of babies
in our family right now.

394
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:18,530
- Mmm-hmm.

395
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,582
- It's pretty cool huh?

396
00:12:19,582 --> 00:12:22,339
I just want you to know
that I'm grateful for you.

397
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,963
And how good you are to your brother

398
00:12:23,963 --> 00:12:26,019
and how nice you are to your cousins.

399
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,851
And how good you are at
being a good listener.

400
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:30,744
I love that you're my son, you know that?

401
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:31,945
- Yeah.

402
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,002
- I love you buddy.

403
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:33,938
- I love you.

404
00:12:33,938 --> 00:12:35,810
- Okay, let's read a story

405
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,034
and we'll say goodnight to our friends.

406
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,048
- Okay, goodnight friends.

407
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:41,256
- [Jared] Are you waitin'
for me by the stairs?

408
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:43,563
Is that what you're doing, huh?

409
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:44,868
You waitin' for me?

410
00:12:44,868 --> 00:12:46,709
That's a good girl.

411
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,209
Oh that's is like the best dog smile ever.

412
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:53,658
Aww look at that.

413
00:12:53,658 --> 00:12:55,249
I love how she leans into it,

414
00:12:55,249 --> 00:12:57,935
oh yeah, that's the spot.

415
00:12:57,935 --> 00:13:00,216
Ellie, can we talk for a second?

416
00:13:00,216 --> 00:13:02,720
I need to talk to you about your cravings.

417
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,901
You've had very specific
cravings this week.

418
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:05,520
Oh no!

419
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,901
You have had very specific
cravings this week.

420
00:13:09,901 --> 00:13:10,734
And they all.

421
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:12,276
- First let me wipe this crap off.

422
00:13:12,276 --> 00:13:13,381
- You turd.
- Oh geez, Penny.

423
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:14,487
- What a turd.

424
00:13:14,487 --> 00:13:17,928
All of your cravings have involved cheese.

425
00:13:17,928 --> 00:13:18,933
- What?

426
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:19,766
- Mac and cheese?

427
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:21,226
- Okay, and you want to know what,

428
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:22,306
that sounds disgusting.

429
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:24,613
- [Jared] It does, it kinda does.

430
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:25,446
- But I needed it.

431
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:28,853
- Nachos, broccoli,
- I really wanted salt.

432
00:13:28,853 --> 00:13:29,853
- Like yeah.

433
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,257
So this is the first time Ellie,

434
00:13:33,257 --> 00:13:34,509
and I think I mentioned this before,

435
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,342
but this is the first time

436
00:13:35,342 --> 00:13:38,411
that Ellie has cravings that are like

437
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,739
very specific
- Legit cravings.

438
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:42,433
- and legit, like she hasn't
had very many cravings

439
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,045
where she's like, I need this right now,

440
00:13:45,045 --> 00:13:46,470
except for this time.

441
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,626
Except for this time.

442
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:51,726
So it's definitely interesting
to compare the pregnancies,

443
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:52,574
you know?

444
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:56,171
- Well and I've told Jared,
like I don't want little snacks,

445
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:58,291
I need full blown meals every time I eat.

446
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,124
- [Jared] Yeah.

447
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:01,419
- I need five full blown meals a day.

448
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:02,408
- [Jared] Yeah.

449
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:03,741
- I am starving.

450
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:08,126
I'm starving and I'm sick

451
00:14:08,126 --> 00:14:09,926
and if I don't eat
- And you're eating a ton.

452
00:14:09,926 --> 00:14:11,451
- Like today I was like, I need lunch,

453
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,916
and it was 10 o'clock.

454
00:14:12,916 --> 00:14:14,208
I had breakfast.

455
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,726
I ate, but I needed another meal at 10.

456
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:19,931
- And you had breakfast at nine.

457
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,104
(laughing)

458
00:14:21,104 --> 00:14:22,959
- Yeah and then I rolled
out of bed at nine.

459
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,130
So it's just crazy.

460
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,445
It's crazy and exciting.

461
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:29,022
I'm trying to think what else.

462
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:29,922
It's weird that we're talking about it.

463
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:33,055
I feel a little weird today,

464
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:34,413
'cause we're like talking about it

465
00:14:34,413 --> 00:14:36,027
and it feels kind of funny.

466
00:14:36,027 --> 00:14:40,027
I have a bowl of mints
and Werther's to suck on,

467
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:43,364
because that's what I've been
eating too throughout the day.

468
00:14:43,364 --> 00:14:45,139
- [Jared] To kind of keep
your taste buds satisfied

469
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:46,917
in between meals.

470
00:14:46,917 --> 00:14:48,425
- Yeah.

471
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,389
- [Jared] Funny.

472
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:50,379
- Okay, let's go eat these chips.

473
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,370
We used to eat these all the time

474
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:54,855
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm, nachos.
- in college.

475
00:14:54,855 --> 00:14:56,001
- But I have beans.

476
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,912
Doesn't that look so gross?

477
00:14:57,912 --> 00:14:59,872
Here's your plate and here's mine.

478
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:00,786
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

479
00:15:00,786 --> 00:15:04,302
- And that is a wrap from us to you.

480
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,281
Our first official day of really talking

481
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:08,009
about the pregnancy.

482
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:10,592
We are so unbelievably excited.

483
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,396
There's a huge nervous part of me,

484
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,763
that is still very nervous.

485
00:15:15,763 --> 00:15:17,676
It is still really early.
(Penny panting)

486
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:18,983
But I just have to keep telling myself,

487
00:15:18,983 --> 00:15:20,648
things are good right now,

488
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:23,072
and be really happy and excited,

489
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:23,905
and I am,

490
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,946
but sometimes those nerves
in the back of my head

491
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,474
come forward and I get really anxious.

492
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:30,974
But, I am happy, I am excited,

493
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:33,554
I am sick.

494
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:34,387
(laughs)

495
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:35,849
I definitely haven't dry heaved,

496
00:15:35,849 --> 00:15:38,507
and felt way way nauseous
the last few days.

497
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:39,668
I've just felt a little sick,

498
00:15:39,668 --> 00:15:41,388
which has been awesome.

499
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:44,236
I love food, I love food.

500
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,668
Trying to drink a lot of water right now.

501
00:15:46,668 --> 00:15:47,501
This is crazy.

502
00:15:47,501 --> 00:15:48,755
Jared just took Penny out,

503
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,915
because I think she was being really loud.

504
00:15:50,915 --> 00:15:52,996
Thank you guys so much for watching

505
00:15:52,996 --> 00:15:56,876
and I can't wait for this
next chapter in our life.

506
00:15:56,876 --> 00:16:00,274
The last few months have
been a whirlwind of emotions

507
00:16:00,274 --> 00:16:05,107
and I really hope and pray
that this pregnancy goes safe.

508
00:16:05,107 --> 00:16:06,450
So thank you guys.

509
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,554
We'll see you tomorrow.

510
00:16:07,554 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
