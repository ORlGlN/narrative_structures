1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:03,229
- [Child] Why is the
cord in the baby's tummy?

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,470
- I've got an idea;
let's get paper towels!

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:07,464
It was heartbreaking.

4
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:10,628
It was exciting, and so much more.

5
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:11,835
- 14 weeks today.

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,530
I think I'm going to
do an update tomorrow.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,720
- Oh, that's a great idea.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,258
- [Child] Oh.

9
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:17,091
What the?

10
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:21,384
- I don't know what is more
fun, setting up Christmas

11
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:24,803
or cleaning the house after Christmas.

12
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:28,176
I have been cleaning,
going room to room, while

13
00:00:28,176 --> 00:00:31,739
the kids have been
playing, and running wild.

14
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,138
Hey, and Jackson just
asked me, do you remember

15
00:00:34,138 --> 00:00:35,651
what you just asked me?

16
00:00:35,651 --> 00:00:39,234
- I wanted to see the baby in your tummy.

17
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:41,441
- Oh, well, that was one thing.

18
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:44,488
I've been showing him my
app, of how big the baby is.

19
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:47,290
But I just walked by, and I went, 'Ohhh.'

20
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,322
And he went, 'How are you feeling, Mom?'

21
00:00:49,322 --> 00:00:52,871
And I was like, 'I'm sick,
but thank you so much.'

22
00:00:52,871 --> 00:00:55,476
He was so cute, to ask
me how I was feeling.

23
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:57,010
I've been cleaning, but
I've kind of been taking

24
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,010
a lot of breaks, because I really.

25
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,843
It's weird.

26
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:02,176
One day, you feel great,
like yesterday, I felt great.

27
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:03,522
Last night, I didn't feel well.

28
00:01:03,522 --> 00:01:05,322
Woke up, definitely didn't feel well.

29
00:01:05,322 --> 00:01:09,239
But today, I am 14 weeks,
and I showed Jackson,

30
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,930
this is what the baby looks lik.

31
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,427
This is the size of the baby.

32
00:01:16,427 --> 00:01:18,050
I showed him all that.

33
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,378
This is how big the baby is.

34
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:21,963
- Where's the cord?

35
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:24,002
- The cord is right here.

36
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,811
- How is the cord in the baby's tummy?

37
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:29,576
- The cord is in the baby's belly button.

38
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:30,498
- Why?

39
00:01:30,498 --> 00:01:32,056
- And then it hooks up to Mommy.

40
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:33,745
And that's how the baby gets food.

41
00:01:33,745 --> 00:01:37,662
So when I eat, the baby
gets lots of nutrients.

42
00:01:39,245 --> 00:01:40,389
Cool, huh?

43
00:01:40,389 --> 00:01:42,542
Do you know that you used
to have an umbilical cord?

44
00:01:42,542 --> 00:01:43,375
- Mm-hmm.

45
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,933
- And Daddy cut it when you were born?

46
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:45,797
- Mm-hmm.

47
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:47,077
- We have a video of it.

48
00:01:47,077 --> 00:01:48,190
Cool, huh?

49
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,211
- And the app I use is the Bump.

50
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,795
I'm sure a lot of you
guys might ask, so, that,

51
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:53,996
let me see.

52
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:55,180
Yeah, the Bump.

53
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,597
I wanted to make sure
that I said that right.

54
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:58,019
But I just thought that
was really cute, he asked

55
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,076
how I was feeling.

56
00:01:59,076 --> 00:02:03,708
But on to the next bathroom,
and lots of laundry.

57
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:06,336
Gotta get this one done,
and then I am done.

58
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:07,725
Then I'm done!

59
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,037
Wasn't too shabby.

60
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:10,732
When I was cleaning my
bathroom, though, I wanted

61
00:02:10,732 --> 00:02:12,415
to go grab the camera
and show you guys, but

62
00:02:12,415 --> 00:02:14,806
I couldn't find it, and
then I was in my groove.

63
00:02:14,806 --> 00:02:18,545
But this is what I've been
using lately, for my tubs.

64
00:02:18,545 --> 00:02:21,018
And it is, like, heaven
sent, because I don't feel

65
00:02:21,018 --> 00:02:23,059
like I'm bending over as
much with the washcloths

66
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,128
scrubbing, I just really liked it.

67
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,595
I got it at a local
cleaning store, but I know

68
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:30,259
you can find some on
Amazon or like Google, like

69
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,994
handheld scrubbers, even
Walmart I'm sure would

70
00:02:32,994 --> 00:02:36,251
have something like that,
but it's not very coarse,

71
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:39,778
but just enough to like
wash and scrub your tub.

72
00:02:39,778 --> 00:02:42,309
My tub always needs to
be washed, because we use

73
00:02:42,309 --> 00:02:45,283
tons of bath bombs and then
it, sometimes it leaves

74
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:48,052
like oil residue on the
edge, and then it colors

75
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:51,829
and sparkles, so we just
need to wash my tub lots,

76
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,162
because of that.

77
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,839
- Whoa! That was a lot of marbles.

78
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,488
Are you going to do it again?

79
00:02:59,488 --> 00:03:02,071
(baby babbles)

80
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,702
Jackson, does it still
feel like Christmas?

81
00:03:05,702 --> 00:03:06,535
- Yeah.

82
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:07,588
- Yeah? You like playing with all your

83
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:08,877
Christmas toys, boys?

84
00:03:08,877 --> 00:03:09,771
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:09,771 --> 00:03:11,685
- Yeah? Yeah, more!

86
00:03:11,685 --> 00:03:13,010
Can you do it?

87
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,548
- [Jackson] I can do it! I can do it!

88
00:03:14,548 --> 00:03:15,708
- Let's see it.

89
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,164
Down it goes.

90
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,453
Yay!

91
00:03:18,453 --> 00:03:19,709
- Let me do it.

92
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,410
- Yeah, okay.

93
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,748
- I'm not going to put
it in those little holes.

94
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:26,803
- Yeah, because you got these
big ones here, blocking it.

95
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,556
(laughs)

96
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:30,466
So Grandma and Grandpa
Meekem are coming over soon,

97
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:32,038
and we're going to show
them everything that we

98
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:33,037
got for Christmas.

99
00:03:33,037 --> 00:03:34,779
Are you excited to show 'em?

100
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:36,165
What do you think you're
going to show them first?

101
00:03:36,165 --> 00:03:36,998
- Uh.

102
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,054
- The Jack-in-the-Box?

103
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,701
(laughter)

104
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,939
Ready for this?

105
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:44,772
- [Female Voice] Yeah.

106
00:03:44,772 --> 00:03:45,733
- [Male Voice] I don't know.

107
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:46,940
- A rock tumbler!

108
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:49,141
- Oh, my goodness!

109
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,478
- Oh, my goodness! That will be so fun!

110
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,715
- Should we take a
little peek and see what

111
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,149
they look like?

112
00:03:55,149 --> 00:03:56,066
- Uh-huh.

113
00:03:56,066 --> 00:03:57,244
- OK.

114
00:03:57,244 --> 00:03:58,603
- We should turn it on.

115
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,030
- One day left, so we gotta let it go for

116
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,219
one more day, OK?

117
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:03,052
- [Grandmother] Wow.

118
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:05,869
Let's see what they look like.

119
00:04:05,869 --> 00:04:08,396
- I'm excited, because I
haven't seen it yet, either.

120
00:04:08,396 --> 00:04:12,563
(children talking and making noise)

121
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,371
- Ew is right!

122
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:31,204
Uh, it was a bad idea,
let's get paper towels.

123
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:37,623
- [Child] Oh! What the?
Don't drain down, down.

124
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:42,102
- [Mother] Look, I polished them a lot.

125
00:04:42,102 --> 00:04:43,223
- [Father] Wow.

126
00:04:43,223 --> 00:04:44,784
- [Child] It's finished!

127
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,895
- It softened them up quite a bit, huh?

128
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,062
You want to put them in there?

129
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:48,967
- Yeah.

130
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:49,800
- OK.

131
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,343
Drop them in.

132
00:04:51,343 --> 00:04:52,502
Whoa.

133
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,502
(children giggling)

134
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:57,906
Wow, look at that.

135
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,904
- [Jackson] I'm going to dry them up.

136
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:07,087
- [Mother] Look, this one has navy.

137
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:09,920
- [Father] Wow, look at that, bud.

138
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,684
- [Child] Hold this one.

139
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:12,700
- [Father] Is that cool?

140
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,070
- [Jackson] This one's finished.

141
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,382
- Almost.

142
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,814
- [Mother] You want to keep
that one out for this time?

143
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:18,647
- Yeah.

144
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:20,293
- Because, Jackson, we're
going to put them back in

145
00:05:20,293 --> 00:05:23,310
the tumbler, with more
grit, to make them even

146
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,319
shinier, so let's keep
one rock out, and then

147
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,023
shine the rest up.

148
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:31,216
- [Grandmother] OK, let's try it.

149
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:34,254
- I have an app, and it
shows how big the baby is.

150
00:05:34,254 --> 00:05:37,464
- [Father] What do you want
Grandma and Grandpa to see?

151
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:39,107
- [Jackson] The baby.

152
00:05:39,107 --> 00:05:40,686
- Can we see pictures of it?

153
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,317
How?

154
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,998
- On my phone, it shows
how big the baby is, huh?

155
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:47,198
I guess if two o'clock
passes, and you have not

156
00:05:47,198 --> 00:05:49,463
gotten ready, most likely,
you're not going to

157
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,639
get ready for the day,
so this is what I'm going

158
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,972
to be the rest of the
day, but I want to show

159
00:05:53,972 --> 00:05:55,317
you guys what I'm doing.

160
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,205
I've been asking you guys,
I've been talking with

161
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:58,854
you guys a ton on Twitter,
and I've been telling

162
00:05:58,854 --> 00:06:02,349
you, I've been so excited
to start bullet journaling,

163
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:05,756
and for Christmas, I got
Emily a ton of stuff for

164
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:09,272
her to do bullet journaling,
and I've watched a

165
00:06:09,272 --> 00:06:12,606
bajillion videos, and a lot
of people like this brand

166
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:14,991
of notebooks, so I ordered her some stuff,

167
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:16,316
and me some stuff,

168
00:06:16,316 --> 00:06:19,733
and I got some fun tape, I got some tabs,

169
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:24,443
just like everything I
need to start doing this

170
00:06:24,443 --> 00:06:25,377
bullet journaling.

171
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:28,771
Usually, I really like Erin
Condryn, I like her planner.

172
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:33,249
This year, for 2017, I've
been using In the Leafy

173
00:06:33,249 --> 00:06:35,223
Tree Tops Planner.

174
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:38,839
I like hers, because she
has a lot of different

175
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,136
types of styles, like if
you're Christian, she has

176
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:45,066
a bunch of other stuff, but
I just know that she has

177
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:47,104
one specific one, like if
you're Christian, it has

178
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:50,720
like lots of church stuff
in it, so I liked hers,

179
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,745
but a lot of times, those
planners, you don't utilize

180
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:56,912
every single page, and often
times, I have my planner,

181
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,336
but then I write on paper
all the time like our daily

182
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:04,361
to-do list, or what I
want to do, and I'm always

183
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:05,963
writing stuff down.

184
00:07:05,963 --> 00:07:06,880
Hi, Mister.

185
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:11,492
I'm always writing
stuff down, and when you

186
00:07:11,492 --> 00:07:13,212
guys had told me about
bullet journaling, I kind of

187
00:07:13,212 --> 00:07:16,107
fell in love with it, so
I'm excited to start that

188
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:19,825
out, and I'm going to start it today.

189
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:22,179
It's Mama's crafts.

190
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,236
- What about these?

191
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,347
- Those are stickers.

192
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:25,392
- For me?

193
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:26,225
- For mom.

194
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,828
- Well, what about me, then?

195
00:07:28,828 --> 00:07:30,500
- Well, I bet I could give
you some paper, and you

196
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,194
could help me, and you could have a few.

197
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:34,970
- But I want to help you.

198
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:35,803
- You can.

199
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,418
Would you like your own
paper, and to put some

200
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:40,874
stickers on, and to draw?

201
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:44,874
To stencil and make it
look cute and perfect?

202
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:47,875
- I just want paper and draw.

203
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,452
- OK, that sounds like a good idea.

204
00:07:49,452 --> 00:07:50,731
Let's do that.

205
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:54,440
But I'm going to do that
so um I'll end up not

206
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,891
using a planner.

207
00:07:55,891 --> 00:07:59,049
This is like, for, from
Erin Condryn, this is

208
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:02,788
for all our family's
addresses and phone numbers,

209
00:08:02,788 --> 00:08:04,291
so I'll keep that.

210
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:05,763
I'm just kind of organizing my stuff.

211
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,626
This goes on the side of my bed.

212
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:11,069
And then this bag holds my
computer, and some notebook

213
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:13,829
stuff that always goes in
between my chair in my bedroom.

214
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:15,651
Tom is taking a nap, though,
so that is why I kind of

215
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,723
came in here.

216
00:08:16,723 --> 00:08:18,755
And then, for Christmas,
I already show you this

217
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,410
hand lettering, got it
on Amazon, then I've been

218
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,743
working on that.

219
00:08:23,796 --> 00:08:25,746
So I've been having fun,
and I'm excited for the

220
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,387
new year, and to write
down my plans, and goals,

221
00:08:28,387 --> 00:08:29,755
and start those.

222
00:08:29,755 --> 00:08:30,588
- What are these?

223
00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:31,923
- That's tape.

224
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:33,763
- I want to do tape with you.

225
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,979
- What? You want to do all of it with me?

226
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:38,216
You just want to be my buddy?

227
00:08:38,216 --> 00:08:39,049
- Uh-huh.

228
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:41,754
- Oh, that sounds like a good idea to me.

229
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:43,337
Should we go color?

230
00:08:44,834 --> 00:08:47,225
Get the stencils out, get tape out?

231
00:08:47,225 --> 00:08:48,356
Go crazy?

232
00:08:48,356 --> 00:08:49,626
- But this is tape.

233
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:50,690
(laugh)

234
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,841
- I just feel like today
has been one of those days.

235
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:57,970
If you know what I mean, you
probably know what I mean.

236
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,520
I've been in my office all
day, things have been a

237
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,617
little bit frustrating with
a few different things,

238
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:05,009
and so I was like, 'You
know what? I'm just going to

239
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:08,418
go outside with my dog, Penny,
grab a handful of treats,

240
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:11,128
and we're going to go
on a nice, long walk.'

241
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,896
I want to take Penny to a
place that she's only been

242
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:16,737
like one time, and it's right
next to where we usually

243
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:19,977
go in that park, but it's
up the mountain, and I think

244
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,696
we're going to go up and
see how far we can go on

245
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,909
the mountain, because a
lot of people walk that

246
00:09:25,909 --> 00:09:29,240
with their pets, and I
just want to see how Penny

247
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,778
likes it, because I know
she wants, she probably

248
00:09:31,778 --> 00:09:33,967
wants to go on an adventure
just as much as I do.

249
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:38,134
Yes, I think Penny knows
exactly what we're up to.

250
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,281
Let's go, let's go, come on!

251
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,138
Don't just go jumping around, let's go.

252
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:46,033
That's the goal, right up
there, get to the top of that.

253
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,266
Ready? Take a break.

254
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:48,099
Good girl!

255
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:51,190
Some of you guys have
been asking for updates

256
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,825
on Penny, and her training.

257
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:57,663
And what we've been doing
a lot of is the pulling.

258
00:09:57,663 --> 00:09:59,744
That's one of the biggest
things that she has a

259
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:01,968
hard time with, because
she is so active, and

260
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,600
like trying to smell
things, especially if we

261
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,736
go to a new area, pulling
is a hard thing for her.

262
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,377
So, with those treats, I do
the same thing that I did

263
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:11,552
when I was walking with her on the fence.

264
00:10:11,552 --> 00:10:14,120
We don't go if she's pulling.

265
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,088
As soon as she lets up,
it comes back to me,

266
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:18,584
we walk a little bit
further, she gets rewarded,

267
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:21,538
and then, if she pulls
again, we stop, and we

268
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:23,744
just repeat that process
over and over again.

269
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:25,235
After we've done that for a little while,

270
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:28,009
we'll take her out, let her
go out on a little break.

271
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,223
She's always right next to
me within, like, 20 or 30

272
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:34,025
yards, she comes when she's
called most of the time.

273
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,243
Let's give it a shot.

274
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:36,243
Penny, come.

275
00:10:37,218 --> 00:10:38,968
Good girl! Good girl!

276
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,011
Yeah, things have been going pretty well.

277
00:10:42,011 --> 00:10:42,889
She's still a puppy.

278
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:46,301
She's only one, and so this
is going to be a long process,

279
00:10:46,301 --> 00:10:48,427
and I'm excited to be
working on things with her,

280
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,387
especially as we get out,
into this beautiful open area.

281
00:10:51,387 --> 00:10:55,027
She wants to explore, she
wants to go, and have fun.

282
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:58,058
I do, too, but there are
some rules we have to follow

283
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:58,955
along with that.

284
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,049
Well, she does.

285
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:01,418
I guess I do, too.

286
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,128
This is like, public property,
so gotta follow some rules.

287
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:06,515
Oh man, I tell you what.

288
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,015
That is beautiful.

289
00:11:09,724 --> 00:11:11,391
Look at this valley.

290
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,048
It is just gorgeous.

291
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,448
I am out of breath.

292
00:11:16,448 --> 00:11:17,615
Penny, are you having fun?

293
00:11:17,615 --> 00:11:18,618
(laughter)

294
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:20,134
She's sliding down the hill.

295
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:21,400
Ah, look at that.

296
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,969
Utah has some of the most
beautiful sunsets I have ever

297
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:27,071
seen in my entire life.

298
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:30,310
By hitting those mountains,
they do a great job

299
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,310
of just casting this
beautiful orange and purple

300
00:11:35,645 --> 00:11:37,130
skyline.

301
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,506
It's beautiful.

302
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,387
My hips are burning.

303
00:11:40,387 --> 00:11:41,345
Oh my goodness.

304
00:11:41,345 --> 00:11:42,889
I have no idea how this
is going to effect me

305
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:47,283
when I'm older, but I guess
I just gotta keep moving.

306
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:50,029
That's the thing. That's the key.

307
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:52,029
Just gotta keep moving.

308
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:55,445
Keep those hip flexors
engaged, keep rolling.

309
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:57,860
But not down the hill,
that would be really bad.

310
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,029
(music playing)

311
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,279
Uh-oh. I am smelling skunk.

312
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:06,155
Really, really strong.

313
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:08,755
That is not a good thing to
have, up in the mountains.

314
00:12:08,755 --> 00:12:10,706
Especially with your dog.

315
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:14,543
Because spraying is a
thing, especially up here.

316
00:12:14,543 --> 00:12:16,404
We made it to the top, guys.

317
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,764
Obviously, there are other
mountains, but this is

318
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:20,395
where it's flat.

319
00:12:20,395 --> 00:12:22,142
Check out that sunset.

320
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:23,392
It's beautiful.

321
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:25,788
Woo, made it to the top.

322
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,188
There's another mountain back there.

323
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:29,989
This is gorgeous.

324
00:12:29,989 --> 00:12:31,709
Glad I did it.

325
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,716
Penny, are you glad we did this? Huh?

326
00:12:33,716 --> 00:12:34,633
Yeah. Yeah.

327
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,372
You like the snow?

328
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:39,399
I'm sorry, guys, but I
just cannot get over that.

329
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,982
It's amazing, and I think
it's actually really

330
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:44,924
good timing, to be up
here to talk about this.

331
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:47,428
Ellie and I sat down
today and we talked about

332
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:48,996
our New Year's goals.

333
00:12:48,996 --> 00:12:51,189
And we have a video that
we're going to be talking

334
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:53,436
about that, and we're
actually asking you guys some

335
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:55,189
questions, so stay tuned for that.

336
00:12:55,189 --> 00:12:58,627
But it's just nice to be
up here, in the mountains,

337
00:12:58,627 --> 00:13:02,237
by myself, with my dog
Penny, and just reflecting

338
00:13:02,237 --> 00:13:06,788
on the year, and what we
were able to accomplish.

339
00:13:06,788 --> 00:13:09,348
Some of them were our
goals that we set out.

340
00:13:09,348 --> 00:13:12,762
Some of them weren't goals,
but we did them anyway,

341
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:15,763
and some of them were
things that we're excited

342
00:13:15,763 --> 00:13:17,763
to get going on in 2018.

343
00:13:18,907 --> 00:13:22,996
I loved 2017. It was
busy, it was fun, it was

344
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:27,079
heartbreaking, it was
exciting, and so much more.

345
00:13:28,293 --> 00:13:30,509
And I'm glad that we had
the opportunity to share

346
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,644
the ups and downs with
you, and I can't wait to do

347
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,845
that in 2018 with you guys as well.

348
00:13:36,845 --> 00:13:39,461
What I'd like to know from
you, and we'll probably

349
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,717
ask this a couple of times,
but what are your goals

350
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:45,967
for 2018, whether they're big or small?

351
00:13:46,996 --> 00:13:49,401
What would you like to
do, what would you like to

352
00:13:49,401 --> 00:13:51,340
accomplish in 2018?

353
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,516
2018 is going to be a
big year for us, and I'm

354
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:54,835
excited for it.

355
00:13:54,835 --> 00:13:56,419
OK, Penny, should we get going home?

356
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:57,540
Let's go.

357
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,850
Well, this is kind of a sad site to see.

358
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,986
It's over. It's done.

359
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:06,153
Everything is back in its
proper place, and that feeling

360
00:14:07,101 --> 00:14:09,510
of coming out and just
playing with your toys

361
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,606
is no longer here, so it's
kind of sad right now,

362
00:14:13,606 --> 00:14:14,439
you know?

363
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,750
Like we're getting back to reality.

364
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,814
It's all over, Ellie.

365
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:17,991
It's over!

366
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,414
At least, until next
week, when we celebrate

367
00:14:20,414 --> 00:14:22,199
New Years, right?

368
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,454
- Um, the kids will still
love waking up and playing

369
00:14:24,454 --> 00:14:25,422
with their stuff.

370
00:14:25,422 --> 00:14:27,343
- Yeah, it's just not
all in the living room.

371
00:14:27,343 --> 00:14:28,176
- I know.

372
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:29,679
- On display for the kids.

373
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:30,512
- I know.

374
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:36,628
And waking up, and not caring
if crumbs are everywhere.

375
00:14:36,628 --> 00:14:37,461
- Yeah.

376
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,996
- Like today, I cleaned the
kitchen and I went, 'OK,

377
00:14:38,996 --> 00:14:40,045
keep it clean!'

378
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,723
- Oh, and I do have to say.

379
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:45,579
Ellie has been cleaning
all day today, so thank you

380
00:14:45,579 --> 00:14:48,293
for doing that, while I
was working and taking care

381
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:50,116
of Penny and all that.

382
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:50,949
- You're welcome.

383
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:53,003
- You took care of the kids,
and you cleaned all day.

384
00:14:53,003 --> 00:14:53,836
All day.

385
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:56,922
- I think the kids actually
liked it, because they

386
00:14:56,922 --> 00:14:59,190
kind of just ran wild.

387
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:02,394
Like I don't know how
Jackson knew how to turn

388
00:15:02,394 --> 00:15:03,843
Jared's little game on.

389
00:15:03,843 --> 00:15:05,036
- Oh, my gosh!

390
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:09,376
OK, so I get home from
running errands, and Jackson

391
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:12,135
is playing the Nintendo
Switch, and Ellie's like,

392
00:15:12,135 --> 00:15:13,544
'I didn't give it to him.'

393
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:14,377
- I did not.

394
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:16,727
- He is playing Mario Kart, and racing.

395
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,153
I don't know how he did that.

396
00:15:18,153 --> 00:15:21,023
And then, later, I saw
him sitting on his little

397
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:24,912
sleeping bag here, with
the Apple TV remote, and

398
00:15:24,912 --> 00:15:26,665
he's like, 'Oh, I'm just
picking a show, Dad.'

399
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:28,882
I'm like, 'Jackson, you're
three years old! Stop it!

400
00:15:28,882 --> 00:15:31,434
Stop educating yourself
with this technology.'

401
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,602
- And that, my friends,
is Jackson running wild.

402
00:15:33,602 --> 00:15:34,935
While I cleaned.

403
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:36,658
- Yeah.

404
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:37,500
- I think it's funny.

405
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,657
- It is funny. It's hilarious.

406
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,353
- He's actually four.

407
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:41,186
- Next week.

408
00:15:41,186 --> 00:15:42,019
- Yeah.

409
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:42,852
- Oh, my goodness.

410
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,208
- What should we get him
for his birthday, guys?

411
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:45,692
- He's a four-year-old.
What should we get him?

412
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:46,658
I mean, he has rocks.

413
00:15:46,658 --> 00:15:48,387
What more could he ask for?

414
00:15:48,387 --> 00:15:51,444
- Um, but really though,
you guys kind of saw what

415
00:15:51,444 --> 00:15:55,230
he got from Santa, but is
there anything that you

416
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,447
think a four-year-old,
or that you think Jackson

417
00:15:57,447 --> 00:15:58,413
may like?

418
00:15:58,413 --> 00:16:00,334
Please let me know, because
I think it would be fun

419
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:03,032
to, I don't know what to
do about his birthday.

420
00:16:03,032 --> 00:16:05,350
We'll just be, like,
low-key here at the house,

421
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,605
but I want him to have
something special, you know?

422
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:10,358
- Yeah. Let us know in
the comments down below.

423
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:11,573
So that's it.

424
00:16:11,573 --> 00:16:14,398
Christmas is kind of over,
and it's kind of sad,

425
00:16:14,398 --> 00:16:17,157
but New Year's is going
to be a lot of fun.

426
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:20,824
I'm really excited about
2018 in general, but

427
00:16:20,824 --> 00:16:23,118
specifically the New Year's.

428
00:16:23,118 --> 00:16:24,184
- Because that's always fun.

429
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,375
- Yeah, it's going to be great.

430
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,838
(cheering)

431
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:29,301
Speaking of treats, we've got grapes.

432
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:31,327
Pay no mind to the Doritos,
we've got the healthy

433
00:16:31,327 --> 00:16:33,758
grapes right here that
we're eating, and we are

434
00:16:33,758 --> 00:16:37,039
going to end the night per
our usual, watching a show.

435
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,374
So thank you guys so much for watching.

436
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,762
Thank you for sticking around with us.

437
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:42,885
This entire year, we
appreciate you, and we are

438
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,174
grateful for you.

439
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:46,454
Have a wonderful day, and
we will see you tomorrow.

440
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:47,982
- How many more months til baby comes?

441
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:51,325
- Six months, yeah, six months,
because today's the 28th.

442
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,597
- Six months.

443
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,334
(groaning)

444
00:16:55,334 --> 00:16:56,815
Six months.

445
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:58,071
- Six months til baby.

446
00:16:58,071 --> 00:16:59,806
- 14 weeks today, I
think I'm going to do an

447
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:00,886
update tomorrow.

448
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:01,958
- Oh, that's a great idea.

449
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,055
- Depending on how I feel.

450
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:03,888
- Baby update.

451
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:05,743
- Because, as you can tell,
today was cleaning day.

452
00:17:05,743 --> 00:17:08,292
- I think you look clean and beautiful.

453
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:09,125
- Thank you.

454
00:17:09,126 --> 00:17:09,959
- You always do.

455
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:10,791
OK, this time it's for real.

456
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,624
- OK, bye bye!

457
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,458
Go away.

458
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,290
I want to watch the show.

459
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:14,123
- Say good night, Kevin.

460
00:17:14,124 --> 00:00:00,000
- Night.
