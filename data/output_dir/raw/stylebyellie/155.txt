1
00:00:00,022 --> 00:00:02,603
- I just told Jared that I
win 10 wife points today.

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:05,167
I just ran to the store,
got a bunch of stuff

3
00:00:05,167 --> 00:00:09,053
for Jared's trip, and I
am making Jared and Landon

4
00:00:09,053 --> 00:00:10,734
some tin foil dinners.

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,727
But I guess I shouldn't
say I win 10 points,

6
00:00:12,727 --> 00:00:15,356
'cause he wins 10 points
too, because he just did

7
00:00:15,356 --> 00:00:17,795
two videos today so he
could do an overnight trip.

8
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:20,513
So, I am getting ready
for tin foil dinners

9
00:00:20,513 --> 00:00:22,746
and I keep thinking,
we've used our fire pit

10
00:00:22,746 --> 00:00:25,900
outside once, and I think
it'd be really fun to make

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,794
tin foil dinners outside with the boys.

12
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:30,281
I think that would be so fun soon.

13
00:00:30,281 --> 00:00:32,781
But today is a fall, fall day.

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,901
It is a little chilly outside.

15
00:00:35,901 --> 00:00:39,136
I've got my bats turned on, the lights,

16
00:00:39,136 --> 00:00:40,851
and I have some bats over here too.

17
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:42,790
Jared is charging all of
his stuff for the trip,

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,514
but those are my little
bat lights that are out.

19
00:00:45,514 --> 00:00:46,800
But this is actually really fun.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,202
I haven't made a tin foil
dinner in like, several years.

21
00:00:49,202 --> 00:00:52,656
When we first got married, we
went up to his family's cabin

22
00:00:52,656 --> 00:00:54,124
and I made tin foil dinners then.

23
00:00:54,124 --> 00:00:55,932
But, I don't think I've made 'em since.

24
00:00:55,932 --> 00:00:58,146
- Yes, major, major wife points for Ellie.

25
00:00:58,146 --> 00:00:59,284
She's helping out a ton.

26
00:00:59,284 --> 00:01:01,195
I've been rushing like
crazy to get videos done,

27
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:05,361
uploaded, scheduled, and
packed, because we're takin'

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,317
this guy on an adventure this weekend.

29
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,589
It's gonna be so much fun.

30
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:11,979
My old box here is like totally broken,

31
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:14,471
and the frame is all bent
because it was like a bag

32
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:15,473
with a frame.

33
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:17,461
This is a hard shell (taps).

34
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:19,395
So I'm really excited
about all the more space

35
00:01:19,395 --> 00:01:20,228
that I have in here.

36
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:23,092
Everything that I need
to stay over the weekend

37
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:27,259
is in here plus more clothes
and food for other people.

38
00:01:28,387 --> 00:01:29,876
It's really, really great.

39
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:31,470
I'm about to head over to Joel's house.

40
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:33,835
We're gonna meet up and
we're gonna take off.

41
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:36,122
Gotta get some gas, but I am so excited.

42
00:01:36,122 --> 00:01:38,631
This is like, this is
the funnest thing ever.

43
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:40,634
Alright kiddos, alright wife, say goodbye

44
00:01:40,634 --> 00:01:43,062
to your favorite person in the world.

45
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:43,895
Muah!

46
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:47,196
(chuckles) I love you.

47
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:48,618
- I love you.

48
00:01:48,618 --> 00:01:52,513
- Mm mm (kissing noises)
- Kiss dad.

49
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,855
Kiss daddy.
- Mm mm

50
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:56,039
- Kiss daddy.
- Muah! (laughs)

51
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,872
- Can you tell it's quiet time?

52
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:59,259
- It is quiet time.
- We're just resting.

53
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,457
- [Jared] Okay you all close your eyes.

54
00:02:01,457 --> 00:02:04,586
Dream of great things of fun adventures,

55
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:06,631
and being good boys, okay?

56
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:09,281
- [Ellie] Did you get
the best spots in town?

57
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:13,233
- May I introduce to you, Emma and Olivia!

58
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,066
- Woo! (clapping)

59
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:24,941
♫ I wish everybody on this island

60
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,741
♫ Seems so happy on this island

61
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:31,201
♫ So maybe I know I'm not

62
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:35,368
♫ And no one knows, how far I'll go

63
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:43,408
(cheering)
- Olivia, do a bow!

64
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:46,756
- The boys are officially
gone on this rainy day.

65
00:02:46,756 --> 00:02:50,224
They headed out on their
little trip, and we are just

66
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:53,548
playing with the cousins and
getting ready to make food.

67
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,404
Julie has an awesome
dessert we're gonna make.

68
00:02:55,404 --> 00:02:57,214
Bonnie has an awesome
dessert we're gonna make,

69
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:59,578
and I have an awesome
dinner we're gonna make.

70
00:02:59,578 --> 00:03:03,333
So I think everybody's
happiness is fulfilled

71
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,638
'cause there was cousins and
all of our tummies will be--

72
00:03:05,638 --> 00:03:06,471
- Full of sugar!

73
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:08,041
- Full of food!

74
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:11,708
(upbeat instrumental music)

75
00:03:22,974 --> 00:03:24,108
(laughing)

76
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:25,941
- I just let Penny in.

77
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:32,584
And she may have accidentally
knocked Calvin over.

78
00:03:32,584 --> 00:03:33,692
She's just excited.

79
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:36,424
- Woo!
(laughing)

80
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,773
- Got some music on.

81
00:03:38,773 --> 00:03:42,515
Just tryin' to, everyone just relax.

82
00:03:42,515 --> 00:03:45,911
♫ Better walk, better walk that walk baby

83
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:46,834
- What are you doin' if I was me?

84
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,462
- This is perfect for you to play with.

85
00:03:48,462 --> 00:03:51,259
- [Ellie] I think Cody wants
to play Play-Doh for a second.

86
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:54,277
- I think your mask is on backwards.

87
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:56,584
Your mask is inside out.

88
00:03:56,584 --> 00:04:00,167
(indistinct conversations)

89
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,247
(upbeat instrumental music)

90
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:29,498
♫ - oh I won't give in
'till I reach the end

91
00:04:29,498 --> 00:04:32,072
- Mister Jackson has been
a music party pooper,

92
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:36,361
but not now, I found a song that he loves.

93
00:04:36,361 --> 00:04:37,778
Woohoo! And Cody!

94
00:04:38,762 --> 00:04:41,490
Tell us what we're makin'.

95
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,535
- We're making ghost brownies.

96
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,815
- [Ellie] K.

97
00:04:45,815 --> 00:04:47,806
- No, put them in your
hands or their gonna melt.

98
00:04:47,806 --> 00:04:51,973
So while it's wet you can make
a ghost face on the front.

99
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:56,121
So you put your eyes on, and the nose.

100
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:59,553
Does it look kind of like a ghost?

101
00:04:59,553 --> 00:05:00,609
(laughing)
- [Ellie] Cute.

102
00:05:00,609 --> 00:05:02,859
- We'll pour your ghost on.

103
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:05,680
- Oh! It's sliding!

104
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,463
- [Ellie] K. Can you put your
little eyeballs on it Jacks?

105
00:05:07,463 --> 00:05:08,571
- Hey do you want to put them on?

106
00:05:08,571 --> 00:05:09,722
Do you want me to help you with one eye?

107
00:05:09,722 --> 00:05:10,555
- No, no

108
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,693
(laughing)
- Sorry.

109
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:14,788
- [Ellie] Say, "no thanks"

110
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:16,023
- No thanks.

111
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,317
- Oh, you did so good!

112
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,817
(background conversation)

113
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:23,788
- [Ellie] It looks good!

114
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:26,538
Now do a little nose right there.

115
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:31,810
(background conversation)

116
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,727
Ooh! Scary!

117
00:05:34,113 --> 00:05:35,791
(laughing)

118
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,750
I said, "do you want a fork?"

119
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,110
He said, "no thanks", and
went right to the ghost.

120
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,167
It's a good way to eat it,

121
00:05:41,167 --> 00:05:44,084
that way I don't have to do dishes.

122
00:05:45,306 --> 00:05:47,833
- Biting, and spitting!

123
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,123
- Whose kids are worse?

124
00:05:49,123 --> 00:05:50,263
(laughing)

125
00:05:50,263 --> 00:05:51,454
Turn the camera off!

126
00:05:51,454 --> 00:05:52,476
- You're kid did that to my child.

127
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,292
- We've had a lot of incidents today

128
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,310
when the cousins get together.

129
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,383
It's fun moments but it's also crazy.

130
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,008
Our days' been so fun, it's
kinda turned in to like,

131
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:01,732
a Halloween party in a way.

132
00:06:01,732 --> 00:06:03,259
- [Bonnie and Julie in
Unison] Yeah! It's been fun.

133
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:05,301
(laughing)

134
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,383
- I made stuffed bell peppers for dinner,

135
00:06:07,383 --> 00:06:11,306
Bonnie made a cute dessert,
and then we're gonna play...

136
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:12,223
Hey Calvin!

137
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:15,551
(laughing)

138
00:06:16,912 --> 00:06:19,472
We are gonna play bingo with the kids now,

139
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,203
before we rap up and go to bed.

140
00:06:21,203 --> 00:06:23,306
It's really why I think
our balance is really off,

141
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,587
but Jared's not here to look at it.

142
00:06:25,587 --> 00:06:28,754
(inspirational music)

143
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:31,183
- We made it, we're here.

144
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,709
you may remember this from our last trip,

145
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,163
but we've got our fire going,

146
00:06:35,163 --> 00:06:36,406
we've got the goodies on the table,

147
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:37,923
and this is really the
most important part of

148
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:39,545
the whole trip- the goodies, right?

149
00:06:39,545 --> 00:06:40,545
- That's what we brought for dinner.

150
00:06:40,545 --> 00:06:43,030
- [Jared] Yeah, so we've got
our buddies, Muddy Buddies.

151
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:45,334
(laughing)

152
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:47,460
I think once we get our
fingers a little bit more warm,

153
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:50,149
we're gonna go back out in to
the cold and try some fishing.

154
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,310
- Hey look it's our Grand Station.

155
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,143
- [Jared] Is that where we are?

156
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:52,976
- This is where we're at.

157
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,217
- [Jared] Nice!

158
00:06:54,217 --> 00:06:57,384
(inspirational music)

159
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:43,488
- [Ellie] Wow!

160
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,087
- Olivia, you pick up toys as we go.

161
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:50,112
- K! We are going to pick up the basement.

162
00:07:50,112 --> 00:07:51,493
And then we're gonna play a game.

163
00:07:51,493 --> 00:07:52,345
Can you help me pick up?

164
00:07:52,345 --> 00:07:53,286
- What is it called?

165
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:55,185
- It's called "bingo".

166
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,018
- Bingo?

167
00:07:56,018 --> 00:07:57,336
- [Ellie] Yes.

168
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,548
- Yes!

169
00:07:58,548 --> 00:07:59,715
- I love bingo

170
00:07:59,715 --> 00:08:00,829
- I like bingo!

171
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:02,981
- [Ellie] Okay! Aunt
Bonnie has job for you.

172
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:03,814
Hurry, hurry!

173
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,166
- So we've been fishing for what, I dunno,

174
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,431
45 minutes, half an hour?

175
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:10,527
And no ones caught anything,
no ones even had a nibble.

176
00:08:10,527 --> 00:08:11,938
And the worst part about it,

177
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,597
it's not that we haven't caught any fish,

178
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:16,081
it's that we see the fish in the water,

179
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,500
right in front of us, and
their not doing anything.

180
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,261
They're just like, "I know
what you're trying to do,

181
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:21,684
"you're tryin' to do somethin' bad,

182
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:23,313
"and I don't like it one bit."

183
00:08:23,313 --> 00:08:24,146
- Mocking fishes

184
00:08:24,146 --> 00:08:25,030
- [Jared] Mocking us!

185
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,450
- They should at least
give us a curtesy nibble.

186
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,721
Like, we're out here freezing.

187
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:28,554
- [Jared] Yeah.

188
00:08:28,554 --> 00:08:29,911
- (inaudible) Acknowledge it.

189
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,803
- [Jared] Yeah, acknowledge
that we're making an effort,

190
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:32,635
you know?

191
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,725
Well this is not exactly
how I expected it to go!

192
00:08:34,726 --> 00:08:38,197
(laughing) We had all the
fishing poles on the back of

193
00:08:38,197 --> 00:08:42,073
a 4-wheeler, and we have two out of three.

194
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:44,174
So I'm looking for a fishing pole,

195
00:08:44,174 --> 00:08:48,178
my fishing pole that is, that
fell on the ground somewhere.

196
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:50,595
So, we're looking around now!

197
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:57,085
- Look at your tickets,
and if you have what I say,

198
00:08:57,085 --> 00:08:57,938
you put it on your square.

199
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,447
- Should we each put one in the middle?

200
00:08:59,447 --> 00:09:02,937
- And if you get five in a
row, that's when you win.

201
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,055
Everyone gets one free one in the middle.

202
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:08,413
Everyone put one in the
middle for the free one.

203
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:10,790
Ghost, do you have a ghost on there?

204
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,564
- Wait, I have the ghost!

205
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:15,818
- Good job!
- That's a skeleton.

206
00:09:15,818 --> 00:09:16,832
- Everyone are you ready?

207
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:17,665
- Yes!

208
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:18,645
- Mummy

209
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:19,478
- Do you know what a mummy is?

210
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:20,743
- Yes I got a mummy!

211
00:09:20,743 --> 00:09:21,576
- That's a mummy.

212
00:09:21,576 --> 00:09:23,797
- A mummy is, like,
someone wrapped up in like,

213
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,976
toilet paper, like bandages.

214
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:27,404
(engine roars)

215
00:09:27,404 --> 00:09:29,904
[Jared] Oh! There it is! Wooh!

216
00:09:32,944 --> 00:09:37,183
Yeah! I found it! (laughing)

217
00:09:37,183 --> 00:09:38,016
- Sorry.

218
00:09:38,016 --> 00:09:42,541
- That's alright, here
we'll snap it back on here.

219
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,374
It probably just came right loose.

220
00:09:46,907 --> 00:09:47,762
There we go.

221
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:49,306
- [Ellie] Pumpkin

222
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:50,397
- Yes I found a pumpkin!

223
00:09:50,397 --> 00:09:52,803
(kids laughing)

224
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,844
- [Ellie] You don't have it!

225
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,086
Did you have a pumpkin Emma?

226
00:09:56,086 --> 00:09:57,960
- (child) Yeah! Bingo! Bingo!

227
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,702
- [Bonnie] Pumpkin

228
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:00,702
- [Ellie] K.

229
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:02,784
K.

230
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:04,181
- [Bonnie] Good job Cooper!

231
00:10:04,181 --> 00:10:06,862
- [Ellie] Does everyone
know what a headstone is?

232
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:10,736
- (excited chatter) yes!

233
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:13,788
- I get this one and I win?

234
00:10:13,788 --> 00:10:16,055
- [Ellie] You just need
one more and you win!

235
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:19,222
I am going to have to say, "spiderweb"

236
00:10:20,523 --> 00:10:22,798
(excited chatter)

237
00:10:22,798 --> 00:10:24,132
- Yes! I have spiderweb

238
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:25,362
- [Bonnie] Is there a difference between

239
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:26,589
a spiderweb and a spider?

240
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:27,422
- [Ellie] Yes.

241
00:10:27,422 --> 00:10:28,255
- [Bonnie] Okay.

242
00:10:28,255 --> 00:10:29,173
- Spider.

243
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:33,340
- Yes! I got one, two, three,
four, five, six! I won!

244
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:35,674
- No

245
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:38,622
- [Ellie] In a row,
Jackson did win that one!

246
00:10:38,622 --> 00:10:39,455
- He did?

247
00:10:39,455 --> 00:10:41,676
- [Ellie] Did you? Yep, mummy, pumpkin,

248
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:44,604
free, stone, and then the spider.

249
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,437
Jackson!

250
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:50,663
♫ Hello darkness my old friend

251
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:51,754
Should we play again?

252
00:10:51,754 --> 00:10:52,947
- The kids are like, ticked.

253
00:10:52,947 --> 00:10:54,197
- Bingo! Bingo!

254
00:10:56,409 --> 00:10:58,659
- [Jared] Oh my goodness gracious.

255
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,076
- [Landon] Yowsa!

256
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:03,678
- [Jared] Wow, that looks great!

257
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:06,820
That looks great, that looks great!

258
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,235
Tin foil dinners, guys.

259
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:09,144
- Guess what?

260
00:11:09,144 --> 00:11:09,977
- [Child] Huh?

261
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:12,156
- I have my own little special bowl,

262
00:11:12,156 --> 00:11:14,335
that you get to choose prize out of.

263
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:17,022
So let's play again, and
see if someone else can win.

264
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:20,014
So when we're all done you
can choose a prize, okay?

265
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:20,847
- Can we switch cards?

266
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,703
- [Ellie] Sure!

267
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:24,370
Are you ready mister? You ready?

268
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:26,337
- Can we put it on this

269
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:28,729
since we already cleared it off that time?

270
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,826
- [Ellie] Yep, you'd put it on there--

271
00:11:29,826 --> 00:11:31,010
- Oh, did I get a bingo!

272
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,593
- [Ellie] Good job!

273
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:37,138
(excited chatter)

274
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:38,584
- [Joel] Ya mon', welcome to--

275
00:11:38,584 --> 00:11:39,417
- Jamaican man!

276
00:11:39,417 --> 00:11:40,712
- [Jared] Yeah.

277
00:11:40,712 --> 00:11:42,860
Bradusha svenska,

278
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,534
- German! Austrian?
- herdy cerdy ferdy gerdy

279
00:11:46,534 --> 00:11:47,583
- [Landon] I live next to Finland, yah!

280
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,649
- Whose the chef from the
Muppets? "Herdy slerdy ferdy!"

281
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:51,946
- Chef? I don't know.

282
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:52,779
- [Landon] Swedish.

283
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:53,863
- Get outta here. You lose.
- Oh, Swedish.

284
00:11:53,863 --> 00:11:54,931
(laughing)

285
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:56,912
- [Jared] I like guns,
and I'm from Alaska,

286
00:11:56,912 --> 00:11:58,736
and I ran for Vice-President!

287
00:11:58,736 --> 00:11:59,836
- Sarah Palin
- Yeah.

288
00:11:59,836 --> 00:12:03,919
- Again? Seriously, Joel
just had the worst fart.

289
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,919
Get out.

290
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:08,169
(laughing)

291
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,306
There you have it, 22 degrees,

292
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:13,889
22 degrees outside.

293
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,903
And what do we say
almost 90 degrees inside?

294
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,177
There's quite the difference.

295
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,719
We're gonna keep the fire rollin'.

296
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,182
We've got sleeping bags,
it's gonna be a good night.

297
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:24,317
So we're gonna end the night!

298
00:12:24,317 --> 00:12:25,890
Thank you so much for watching.

299
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,582
Ellie, handing it back over to you.

300
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:30,082
- [Ellie] Alright.

301
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,217
Everyone that got bingo,

302
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:39,381
come and pick one little prize before bed.

303
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:40,214
- I'm picking this!

304
00:12:40,214 --> 00:12:41,470
- [Ellie] Okay, except that.

305
00:12:41,470 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
