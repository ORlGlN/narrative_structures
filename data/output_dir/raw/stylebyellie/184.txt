1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:02,874
(somber music)

2
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:09,321
- [Ellie] I find it very weird
to have so many emotions.

3
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:11,988
To be peaceful, but to be angry,

4
00:00:12,854 --> 00:00:14,950
but to feel calm.

5
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:17,278
- [Jared] God puts rainbows in the clouds,

6
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:20,168
so that each of us in the
dreariest and the dreadest

7
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:23,585
of days, can still see a glimmer of hope.

8
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:26,090
- [On Phone] Continue to hold,

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,673
and I will be with you shortly.

10
00:01:03,368 --> 00:01:06,968
- I find it very weird
to have so many emotions.

11
00:01:06,968 --> 00:01:10,432
To be peaceful, but to be angry,

12
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:13,683
but to feel calm, but
then to not feel calm

13
00:01:13,683 --> 00:01:15,489
and be very frustrated.

14
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:17,201
There's just so many emotions that I have,

15
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:21,468
and it's just really hard to
even understand that myself.

16
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:22,364
But I'm sitting in bed,

17
00:01:22,364 --> 00:01:24,724
because I'm starting to be really crampy.

18
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:26,445
I went to my doctor's office today

19
00:01:26,445 --> 00:01:29,397
and they poked me a bajillion times,

20
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:31,189
they got a lot of blood work done.

21
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:34,739
They're gonna do a little bit of testing.

22
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:37,780
And they got me on some medicine as well.

23
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,419
A D&C is the last option

24
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:42,807
that me and the doctors want to do.

25
00:01:42,807 --> 00:01:45,118
There's some complications
that can come with that,

26
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:46,806
especially because I am young.

27
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,526
So naturally or this way was the options

28
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:51,710
that we chose,

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,004
and so I'm laying in bed
just kind of starting

30
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:55,229
to feel crampy.

31
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:59,104
And Jared and the kids have
just been so cute and tender.

32
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,352
Calvin actually isn't feeling very well.

33
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:02,519
He has a fever.

34
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:05,839
I think it might be his
two year old molars.

35
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:08,830
But they've just been
cute and cuddly and clingy

36
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,963
and Jared's got me food.

37
00:02:10,963 --> 00:02:12,491
And I've watched a few shows,

38
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:14,607
but I'm just like so over it.

39
00:02:14,607 --> 00:02:16,190
I finished one of my books

40
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,838
and now I'm going to be reading

41
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,746
Change Through His Grace by Brad Wilcox.

42
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:22,326
I Instagrammed this, and a lot of people

43
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:24,157
said they love this author.

44
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:25,501
I've actually never read a book from him,

45
00:02:25,501 --> 00:02:27,429
so I'm excited to.

46
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:29,540
And I also am not one to read,

47
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,835
and I've said that before.

48
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:33,531
I love listening to books,
that's my favorite way.

49
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:36,051
And someone said, I'm sad
that you think that Ellie.

50
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:39,968
Reading is peaceful and
it's really nice to do.

51
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:44,115
And every time I read, I love it,

52
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:46,175
but I don't know why I
don't do it more often.

53
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:50,142
And I feel like this
might put me in that mode

54
00:02:50,142 --> 00:02:51,327
to start reading a lot more,

55
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,438
because I have enjoyed

56
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:55,009
Because sometimes when
you're listening to something

57
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,345
you still grab your phone,

58
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:57,661
you're looking around,

59
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:59,717
but reading it's just like
you're in your moment,

60
00:02:59,717 --> 00:03:01,421
you're reading what's written,

61
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:02,833
you're not being distracted,

62
00:03:02,833 --> 00:03:05,024
and I've really enjoyed
that the last few days,

63
00:03:05,024 --> 00:03:08,809
just sitting quiet for
an hour and just reading.

64
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,861
An hour, just however long I can.

65
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,925
But Jared's with the kids right now,

66
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:15,685
and I'm just like resting, so.

67
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,539
I really appreciate Jared,
he is one of a kind.

68
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,434
(toy car buzzing)

69
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,982
Did Dad fix it for you?

70
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:23,815
- Uh-huh.

71
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,317
- [Ellie] Does it work outside?

72
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:27,966
- Yeah, let me show you.

73
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:29,259
- [Ellie] Oh, okay.

74
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,448
Is it working?

75
00:03:30,448 --> 00:03:31,281
- [Jackson] Uh-huh.

76
00:03:31,281 --> 00:03:32,420
- [Ellie] Cool.

77
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,410
- I'm an awesome dad.

78
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:35,000
(Ellie laughs)

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,648
There's few moments where I'm like,

80
00:03:38,648 --> 00:03:40,152
I'm a good dad.

81
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,336
And that was one of them.

82
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:42,420
- [Ellie] What did you do?

83
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,222
- I took it apart and I fixed it

84
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:45,118
(Ellie laughs)

85
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,150
from the inside.

86
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,126
- [Ellie] Matt would be very proud of you.

87
00:03:48,126 --> 00:03:51,293
(tender guitar music)

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,629
Should I close my eyes?

89
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:01,046
- [Jackson] Yeah.

90
00:04:02,436 --> 00:04:05,352
- That tickles, tell me when.

91
00:04:05,352 --> 00:04:06,758
- Open your eyes.

92
00:04:06,758 --> 00:04:08,486
(gasps)

93
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:09,974
- That's so pretty.

94
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:10,851
- [Jared] Yes it is?

95
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:12,400
- Who gave those to us?

96
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,866
- [Jared] I don't know yet, read the card.

97
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:15,949
- Aww, that was so sweet.

98
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:18,065
- [Jared] They're gorgeous.

99
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:20,619
- I never realized how
much I love flowers,

100
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,452
honestly.
- Hey Mom?

101
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:22,286
- What?

102
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:24,027
- Does this scare you?

103
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:26,317
- That doesn't scare me.

104
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:27,844
- Aww Michelle.

105
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:28,744
- [Jared] That's sweet.

106
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:30,827
- Ellie, I knew nothing I would say

107
00:04:30,827 --> 00:04:31,660
would make anything better,

108
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,739
but just know that I'm here
for you if you need someone.

109
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,006
Praying for you and your sweet family.

110
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:37,798
You're such a light in the world.

111
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:40,215
Michelle Peterson, thank you.

112
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:42,037
That's sweet.

113
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,927
I think people say that a lot,

114
00:04:43,927 --> 00:04:45,087
like, I don't know what I could say,

115
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:48,007
but I think even something
simple like that,

116
00:04:48,007 --> 00:04:49,590
is very sweet.

117
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,804
- Absolutely.
- You know?

118
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:54,619
- ]Cause sometimes even though
people are going through

119
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:57,986
something, sometimes you feel very alone.

120
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:01,001
Like my last miscarriage
I felt very alone,

121
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,224
even though I know I wasn't.

122
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:04,807
And I think I feel,

123
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:06,776
if you could feel better,

124
00:05:06,776 --> 00:05:09,767
but I feel a little better
about this one for some reason.

125
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,600
- [Jared] Yeah, absolutely.

126
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,433
- And I'm so grateful for
everyone that's been so sweet.

127
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:15,952
- I think one of the best things

128
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:17,984
that someone can do for you

129
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,848
is just letting them know
that you're there for them.

130
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,296
Sometimes words mean everything.

131
00:05:23,296 --> 00:05:25,423
But knowing that you have someone there,

132
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:27,368
can be everything.

133
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,832
And my sweet brother Matt,

134
00:05:29,832 --> 00:05:33,664
like, they know exactly
what we've gone through.

135
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:36,088
Ruby knows exactly what
we've gone through.

136
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:36,951
- [Ellie] So many of our family members.

137
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:38,095
- So many of our family members

138
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:40,764
have gone through these miscarriages.

139
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:43,150
And Matt's just like, if
you just need to talk,

140
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:44,437
let me know.

141
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:45,877
Thank you Matt.

142
00:05:45,877 --> 00:05:48,812
And I think just knowing, like this,

143
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,365
just having someone say that they're there

144
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:53,579
if you need them, I
think is very very sweet,

145
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,792
so thank you to all those.

146
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:57,976
I was saying outside,

147
00:05:57,976 --> 00:05:59,832
that white truck out there

148
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:02,008
has come to our house a lot,

149
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,814
and I almost know the guy by name now,

150
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,653
so thank you to everyone
who has sent us some things.

151
00:06:06,653 --> 00:06:09,749
My mom came over yesterday
and she made something

152
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:10,793
for Ellie and I'd like to show that.

153
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:12,458
- It's like right now,
like it comes in waves,

154
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:14,821
and it's like right now,
I'm not feeling anything.

155
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,750
But I was 10 minutes ago.

156
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,834
And especially with the medicine,

157
00:06:17,834 --> 00:06:20,129
I definitely will tonight.

158
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:23,321
And it's like we, we are
having a miscarriage.

159
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,154
- [Jared] Yeah.

160
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,838
- We got pregnant,

161
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,965
and I just want to tell
Jared how much I love him.

162
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,721
When I came out of my doctor's office,

163
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,763
he was in the kids area with the kids,

164
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:34,427
and I was like where's dad,

165
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,906
and he was in the
corner, just, I love you.

166
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:38,873
- [Jared] I love you.

167
00:06:38,873 --> 00:06:40,320
- I know this is hard on you too.

168
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,305
- It is, it is hard on me,

169
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:44,161
but having someone there.

170
00:06:44,161 --> 00:06:48,619
I've got you by my side and
you've got me by my side.

171
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:51,167
- And baby, we're gonna
cry in each other's arms.

172
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,419
- Speaking of, so I was just slumped down

173
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,019
in the corner, in the kid's playroom,

174
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,612
holding back the tears.

175
00:06:57,612 --> 00:06:59,763
And then Ellie walks in
and she's got a bandage

176
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,716
on this arm and a bandage on this arm,

177
00:07:01,716 --> 00:07:06,353
because they couldn't
find the vein, I was like,

178
00:07:06,353 --> 00:07:07,390
oh to add insult to injury,

179
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,074
they're just sticking you with needles

180
00:07:09,074 --> 00:07:10,794
all over the place.

181
00:07:10,794 --> 00:07:13,043
I felt bad, but
- Crazy.

182
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:14,670
- [Jared] I'm glad we have each other.

183
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,587
(thoughtful atmospheric music)

184
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:09,149
I think one of the hardest things

185
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:11,259
about having a miscarriage

186
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,099
is you essentially go through it twice.

187
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:18,884
First when you find out that
you're having a miscarriage

188
00:08:18,884 --> 00:08:22,220
and then when you physically
go through the pain

189
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,499
of having the miscarriage.

190
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:26,612
First is the emotional pain

191
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:28,812
and then the physical pain.

192
00:08:28,812 --> 00:08:31,876
And that's a lot of what Ellie's
been going through tonight.

193
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:35,371
She's been going through
a lot of pain right now.

194
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,403
And she's finally getting some rest.

195
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:38,779
It's been a difficult night for her,

196
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,785
but she is very strong
and she is very resilient

197
00:08:42,785 --> 00:08:46,177
and I'm so grateful for
her and for her example.

198
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,777
There's a lot of stuff that's going on

199
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:51,927
in the world today that
can cause us a lot of pain.

200
00:08:51,927 --> 00:08:53,998
My hometown had a school shooting,

201
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:56,081
like that is crazy to me.

202
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:01,587
And it's just a hard
time to be in the world.

203
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:04,620
But Maya Angelou said
that God puts rainbows

204
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,661
in the clouds, so that each of us,

205
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:09,780
in the dreariest and the dreadest of days

206
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,883
can still see a glimmer of hope.

207
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:13,828
And I believe that,

208
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,387
that even in the darkest of days,

209
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:18,395
that we can still see some hope.

210
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:21,019
And there's so many different ways

211
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,779
that we can feel that hope.

212
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,918
And I wanted to ask you guys,

213
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:26,685
what you guys do,

214
00:09:26,685 --> 00:09:27,909
when you're feeling down,

215
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:30,439
when you need that little glimmer of hope.

216
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,724
What brings that to you?

217
00:09:32,724 --> 00:09:36,196
I hope that even in the
midst of these things,

218
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:38,404
the trials that we face,

219
00:09:38,404 --> 00:09:39,693
the things that we go through,

220
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:43,860
that we can be a little bit of
hope and light for you guys.

221
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,568
That's something that
we've always enjoyed doing,

222
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:51,712
is bringing smiles to peoples' faces

223
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:52,832
and hope to people.

224
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:55,784
And I hope that we can
continue to do that.

225
00:09:55,784 --> 00:09:58,912
I just, despite all of
the stuff that's going on,

226
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,912
I still have so much
gratitude in my heart,

227
00:10:00,912 --> 00:10:03,184
for my kids, for my family,

228
00:10:03,184 --> 00:10:04,960
and for all of those who have spent

229
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,305
so much time and effort to put smiles

230
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:09,360
on our faces.

231
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,161
We've had so many people bring flowers

232
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:13,848
and cookies, and all of that to us,

233
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:14,720
and it's made Ellie smile,

234
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,165
so thank you.

235
00:10:16,165 --> 00:10:17,516
It's made us smile.

236
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,349
Thank you for doing that.

237
00:10:18,349 --> 00:10:20,539
We really do appreciate it.

238
00:10:20,539 --> 00:10:22,409
I hope you guys have a wonderful day.

239
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:24,645
And we will see you guys tomorrow.

240
00:10:24,645 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
