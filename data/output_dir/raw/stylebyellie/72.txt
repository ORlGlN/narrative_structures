1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,389
- [Jared] Are you ready my dear?

2
00:00:01,389 --> 00:00:02,222
- Yes.
(bright music)

3
00:00:02,222 --> 00:00:05,076
- [Jared] We are going
to get fish pedicures!

4
00:00:05,076 --> 00:00:06,656
- Yeah!
(Jared laughs)

5
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,466
He's taking me fishing.

6
00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:09,299
- [Jared] Are you ready for this?

7
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:10,581
- Yeah.

8
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,645
Ah!

9
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:14,061
Good morning guys, we
have barricaded ourselves

10
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:14,894
in my room.

11
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:16,788
I'm like, the house is
clean, kids stay in here,

12
00:00:16,788 --> 00:00:19,212
we're all gonna get ready together.

13
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:20,772
But I have two favorite things I want

14
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:23,085
to show you guys before
I finish getting ready.

15
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:25,558
I'm gonna take the kids into town today.

16
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:28,902
And for the life of me,
I'm gonna figure it out,

17
00:00:28,902 --> 00:00:30,592
I'm gonna figure this out.

18
00:00:30,592 --> 00:00:34,370
These socks are the best socks for kids.

19
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:36,874
And I have gone through a lot of socks.

20
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:38,516
The Grow With Me socks from Walmart

21
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,077
are probably one of my favorites.

22
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:42,340
I haven't seen them in a while though.

23
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:45,142
But that's the brand,
we got it in a package

24
00:00:45,142 --> 00:00:47,292
when Jared did Studio C.

25
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,692
Whatever brand that is,

26
00:00:48,692 --> 00:00:50,240
whatever sock this is,

27
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,640
it's the best sock I've ever felt for kids

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,984
and they're so cute.

29
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:56,216
But the other thing I have to go

30
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:59,960
into town is I need to go
get some more face wash.

31
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,472
You guys already know, I have to say this

32
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:02,536
every single time,

33
00:01:02,536 --> 00:01:03,560
I know I repeat myself,

34
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,227
but I am so so picky

35
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:08,464
with what I use on my skin.

36
00:01:08,464 --> 00:01:10,808
That's why I used Shiseido for six years.

37
00:01:10,808 --> 00:01:13,435
And on my channel I had
talked several months ago

38
00:01:13,435 --> 00:01:15,473
that I'd been using Rodan and Fields.

39
00:01:15,473 --> 00:01:17,540
And I still use them
and I really like them,

40
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,833
but I've been using Dermalogica Fash Wash,

41
00:01:19,833 --> 00:01:20,744
because I can just pick it up

42
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:23,000
at Ulta, it's quick, it's here in town

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,184
and you run out of that faster.

44
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:27,864
I hardly ever use exfoliants,

45
00:01:27,864 --> 00:01:29,390
because it's so harsh on your skin,

46
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,044
and especially my skin.

47
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:33,284
It's just really harsh on your skin.

48
00:01:33,284 --> 00:01:36,117
So I usually don't use exfoliants,

49
00:01:37,052 --> 00:01:40,457
but I had run out of my
fash wash like a week ago,

50
00:01:40,457 --> 00:01:42,401
so I've just been using make-up remover

51
00:01:42,401 --> 00:01:43,697
and it's so bad and I've gotten

52
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:45,025
some acne because of it.

53
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:47,161
But I just haven't gone into Ulta.

54
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:49,091
But today I'm gonna grab some stuff.

55
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,146
But this was a sample that I've had,

56
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:54,478
it's Dermalogica, but
it's a super exfoliant.

57
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,031
It's like a black powder.

58
00:01:57,031 --> 00:01:59,039
It's scary, that's why I haven't used it.

59
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,027
And I'm like I don't
want it to be too harsh.

60
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:02,560
But the other day I was like I need

61
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,851
to flippin' wash my face,

62
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:07,684
so I used it, and it was
the most non-abrasive

63
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,443
face wash exfoliant that I've ever used.

64
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:13,526
And my skin felt so good.

65
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,571
So I'm actually going to pick this up

66
00:02:16,571 --> 00:02:18,595
and use it three times a week,

67
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:20,943
instead of the other face wash as well.

68
00:02:20,943 --> 00:02:22,119
I'm gonna mix it.

69
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,429
But I'm really excited about that.

70
00:02:23,429 --> 00:02:24,262
I wanted to share with you guys

71
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:25,855
my two favorite things this morning.

72
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:27,765
This kid when he hears the music,

73
00:02:27,765 --> 00:02:30,116
(mellow pop music)

74
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,449
he break dances.

75
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,134
Are you done?

76
00:02:35,134 --> 00:02:36,400
K, let's go.

77
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,540
Kids you've been very helpful.

78
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,090
Ooh that's a good dance.

79
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,698
Okay, stop filming when we
start dancing like that.

80
00:02:43,698 --> 00:02:44,642
Let's go.

81
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:45,682
They're helping me get my stuff

82
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,066
at Ulta that I need.

83
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,906
And then we're gonna go pick
out some wrapping paper.

84
00:02:49,906 --> 00:02:51,656
Alright my hooligans,

85
00:02:52,609 --> 00:02:54,714
we are ready to go grab some lunch.

86
00:02:54,714 --> 00:02:57,341
So some stores have point systems

87
00:02:57,341 --> 00:02:59,549
and half the time I
never know how it works.

88
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:02,555
And half the time, I'm like
oh save the points whatever.

89
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:05,008
I went to Sephora awhile ago

90
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:06,449
and they use their points

91
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:10,128
and you get a $40 dollar little gift thing

92
00:03:10,128 --> 00:03:12,512
or a little purchase type of thing.

93
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,280
But at Ulta she was like
you have a lot of points,

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,620
she's like, do you want to redeem those?

95
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,475
And I was like I don't
even know what points,

96
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,570
what do you get with the points?

97
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,512
She's like you can get $80 dollars off,

98
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:23,845
and I was like oh sweet,

99
00:03:23,845 --> 00:03:26,808
so bought my face wash,
I bought the exfoliant,

100
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,973
and I paid a dollar,

101
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:31,429
because I had enough points to get it off.

102
00:03:31,429 --> 00:03:33,913
And I was like, I like Ulta's point system

103
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:35,865
much better than Sephora's.

104
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,743
So if you guys have an Ulta by ya,

105
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:39,576
shop there.

106
00:03:39,576 --> 00:03:41,686
Except they don't have the
Beauty Blenders at Ulta,

107
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:43,081
they have the off brands.

108
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:44,552
I haven't tried those yet.

109
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:46,577
Oh, is this the aisle?

110
00:03:46,577 --> 00:03:47,541
- Yeah.

111
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,008
- [Ellie] Okay, what
kind of wrapping paper

112
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:51,465
are you thinking of?

113
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,805
- [Jackson] Spiderman!

114
00:03:52,805 --> 00:03:54,764
- [Ellie] Spiderman?

115
00:03:54,764 --> 00:03:56,536
Just like last year?
- Yeah.

116
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,473
- [Jackson] Uh-huh.

117
00:03:57,473 --> 00:03:59,306
- [Ellie] Oh I see it.

118
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:02,155
- Yay.

119
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:05,657
- [Ellie] Is that the
wrapping paper you want?

120
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:06,923
- Yeah.

121
00:04:06,923 --> 00:04:09,908
- [Ellie] Okay, put it in the cart.

122
00:04:09,908 --> 00:04:12,625
You want Spiderman or do you
want all the superheroes?

123
00:04:12,625 --> 00:04:13,458
- I want Spiderman.

124
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:14,291
- [Ellie] Spiderman?

125
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,124
Okay.

126
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:15,957
- You know how you get that feeling

127
00:04:15,957 --> 00:04:18,108
when you've never done something before,

128
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:20,087
but you're about to do that thing.

129
00:04:20,087 --> 00:04:20,920
You get a little nervous,

130
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,721
you don't know what to expect.

131
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,301
Well I'm going to be doing
that today with Ellie.

132
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:26,434
Ellie, we are doing something

133
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:28,322
that we have never done before.

134
00:04:28,322 --> 00:04:30,269
- Well that sounds, is it skydiving?

135
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:32,933
- Uh no, it's really cold outside,

136
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,005
but that's another one that I really

137
00:04:35,005 --> 00:04:35,838
want to do sometime.

138
00:04:35,838 --> 00:04:36,671
- Okay.

139
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:38,126
- [Jared] But we're
gonna do something today

140
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:38,959
just you and me.

141
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:39,792
- Okay.

142
00:04:39,792 --> 00:04:40,625
- We're gonna have some fun.

143
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,075
And I think we should have
a little bit of fun today.

144
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:43,939
- Sounds awesome.

145
00:04:43,939 --> 00:04:44,855
- Okay, does that sound good?

146
00:04:44,855 --> 00:04:45,746
- Sounds perfect, I've already had fun.

147
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,158
- So if you could clear
your schedule today

148
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:49,429
from like, I don't know,

149
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:52,947
three, four PM on, and then maybe

150
00:04:52,947 --> 00:04:55,933
at 10 or 11, you can resume
any normal activities

151
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,557
that you were going to do.

152
00:04:57,557 --> 00:04:59,172
You can do that, that would be great.

153
00:04:59,172 --> 00:05:01,044
- Who's watching the kids?

154
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:01,877
Are we bringing 'em?

155
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:03,099
- We're gonna bring 'em for a little bit,

156
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,749
then we're gonna hand 'em off to someone,

157
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:06,382
strangers, I don't know,
maybe you know them.

158
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:09,126
- Perfect, strangers is the
easiest, cheapest usually.

159
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:11,689
- Perfect strangers at that,

160
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,063
and we're gonna go have some fun.

161
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,358
We're gonna go do something
that we've never done before

162
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:18,237
and I think it's exciting,

163
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:21,486
but Ellie I just have one thing to say.

164
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,177
- Prepare to get my socks knocked off?

165
00:05:23,177 --> 00:05:25,824
- [Jared] Yes actually, you'll
need to get your feet ready.

166
00:05:25,824 --> 00:05:27,259
- I'm trying to make this fun.

167
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:28,092
I'm excited.

168
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,266
- [Jared] Yeah, seriously,
you'll have to get

169
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:30,465
your feet ready.

170
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,131
Let me see these toes real quick.

171
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,319
When was the last time you painted---

172
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,059
oh perfect, perfect.
- Oh gross, don't show them.

173
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:38,988
- [Jared] Ellie perfect,
perfect, this is gonna be great.

174
00:05:38,988 --> 00:05:41,488
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

175
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,040
Oh my gosh, it's gonna be great.

176
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,873
It's gonna be great.

177
00:05:43,873 --> 00:05:46,111
Oh my gosh, did that just happen again?

178
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,087
Did you hear that Jackson?

179
00:05:48,087 --> 00:05:48,920
- Yeah.

180
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,580
- The water turned on and off by itself.

181
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,723
That was so crazy.

182
00:05:54,723 --> 00:05:55,556
I don't know if you remember,

183
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,397
but that's happened before.

184
00:05:57,397 --> 00:06:00,075
I don't know if it's like static or what,

185
00:06:00,075 --> 00:06:02,147
or a ghost, ooh!

186
00:06:02,147 --> 00:06:05,676
Jackson, do we have a ghost in our house?

187
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:06,509
- Yeah.

188
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,300
- [Jared] We do?

189
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,651
Is it a nice ghost?

190
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:11,163
- It's a naughty Halloween one.

191
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:13,342
- [Jared] It's a naughty Halloween ghost?

192
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:14,878
I think he's nice like Casper.

193
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:15,714
- [Ellie] Creepy, huh?

194
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,465
- [Jared] It is, did you
hear the water turn on?

195
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:18,298
- There's something that does that.

196
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,746
I think it's because I
need to wipe this down,

197
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:22,867
the fingerprints, when it
has lots of fingerprints.

198
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,096
It's weird.

199
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,583
- Well that's a much
more logical explanation

200
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,742
than a ghost.

201
00:06:27,742 --> 00:06:28,805
So I took Penny on a great walk.

202
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,437
We got Paw Patrol rolling.

203
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,809
The question is, are you
ready for the day Ellie?

204
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,616
The day is halfway done,

205
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:35,835
but I'm talking about tonight.

206
00:06:35,835 --> 00:06:37,019
Are you ready for tonight?

207
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:37,961
You don't even know what's gonna happen.

208
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:39,609
- Does it involve dinner?

209
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:41,753
- It can, do you want it to?

210
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:44,835
- Well even if it's not fancy, yes.

211
00:06:44,835 --> 00:06:45,777
- Let me say that again,

212
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:48,313
you're pregnant, of course
it involves dinner Ellie.

213
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:50,737
Of course it does, why would
you even ask that question?

214
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:52,513
- I have felt much better.

215
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,102
Like I definitely feel good.

216
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:56,984
I don't have morning sickness anymore.

217
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,708
I don't feel the urge to have

218
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,404
to always have my stomach full,

219
00:07:00,404 --> 00:07:03,589
but I do like to eat
every few hours still,

220
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,909
just so I have something in me,

221
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:08,045
but it's not like so often, you know?

222
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:10,376
Woo, yahoo, yeah dinner sounds awesome.

223
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:11,816
- I'm glad you feel good,

224
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:13,241
'cause your feet are gonna feel

225
00:07:13,241 --> 00:07:15,297
a heck of a lot better soon.

226
00:07:15,297 --> 00:07:16,130
Woo hoo.

227
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,463
- I think I might know what we're doing.

228
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:28,569
- [Jared] Are you ready my dear?

229
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:29,425
- Yes.

230
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:31,225
- [Jared] Please come with me.

231
00:07:31,225 --> 00:07:32,304
You're so pretty, you know that?

232
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:33,678
- I have no idea where we're going.

233
00:07:33,678 --> 00:07:35,122
I think I know what we're doing,

234
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,056
but then you said something--

235
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,424
- You just said I have no
idea where we're going,

236
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:41,568
I think I know where we're going.

237
00:07:41,568 --> 00:07:42,864
- I thought I knew where we were going,

238
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:43,697
now I don't.

239
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,997
- Okay, here's the deal Ellie.

240
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:47,517
This is what we're doing.

241
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:51,722
Today, we are going to get fish pedicures!

242
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,001
- Yeah!

243
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:56,503
The fish, this day's gonna be fishy.

244
00:07:56,503 --> 00:07:58,140
- Oh it's getting punny.

245
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,291
- That's what I thought we were gonna do.

246
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:00,136
- [Jared] Really?

247
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:01,671
- But then you said something

248
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,206
'cause you were gonna go
in a different direction,

249
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:04,838
I was like, what are we doing?

250
00:08:04,838 --> 00:08:06,568
- [Jared] I tried to
throw a curveball there.

251
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:07,401
- You did.

252
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,234
- Yes.

253
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:10,245
So we are getting fish pedicures today.

254
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:11,829
We've never done this before,

255
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,573
but well we'll explain it
when we get inside there.

256
00:08:13,573 --> 00:08:15,770
- I'm gonna be very
grateful for any date I get,

257
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,403
bit to sounds a little gross.

258
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:18,656
- It sounds a little fishy, right?

259
00:08:18,656 --> 00:08:19,489
(laughing)

260
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,188
- I think this sounds like a better date.

261
00:08:21,188 --> 00:08:23,264
- [Jared] No, those beds
do look comfortable.

262
00:08:23,264 --> 00:08:25,122
- I think this is where
you made the reservation.

263
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:26,780
- [Jared] No no no no no no no no no.

264
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,296
No no no no no no no.

265
00:08:28,296 --> 00:08:30,089
- Okay, help me out.

266
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:32,585
- [Jared] Here we are, are you ready?

267
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:33,418
- Yeah.

268
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:34,900
- [Jared] Are your feed
ready is the question.

269
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,894
- [Ellie] Jackson's birthday present?

270
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,623
- Oh my goodness.
- No.

271
00:08:38,623 --> 00:08:39,489
- I used to have one of these guys

272
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,436
when I was younger.

273
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,789
- [Woman] These are leopard geckos.

274
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,289
- [Ellie] Awesome.

275
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,852
It looks awesome.
- They eat grasshoppers.

276
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:47,347
- [Ellie] And the thicker their tail,

277
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:48,321
the healthier they are?

278
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,154
- [Woman] Mmm-hmm.

279
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,228
- [Ellie] Wow.

280
00:08:50,228 --> 00:08:52,307
- [Jared] You want to hold it?

281
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:54,866
- [Ellie] I think it likes me.

282
00:08:54,866 --> 00:08:55,997
- Hello.

283
00:08:55,997 --> 00:08:57,645
Okay are you ready for this?

284
00:08:57,645 --> 00:08:58,693
You got your pants ready?
- Yeah.

285
00:08:58,693 --> 00:08:59,587
- [Jared] You got your shoes off?

286
00:08:59,587 --> 00:09:01,383
I gotta take mine off.

287
00:09:01,383 --> 00:09:02,216
Hold on.

288
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,799
Oh my goodness, oh.

289
00:09:04,986 --> 00:09:06,469
- So you've never done this before.

290
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:08,125
- [Jared] I've never done this before.

291
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:09,390
So what these guys do is these fish

292
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,414
will just eat off the
dead skin on your feet.

293
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:15,849
And they eat it as food

294
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:17,506
and it's good for them, I guess.

295
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,425
- [Woman] Stick your feet in.

296
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,258
- Just stick our feet in.
- Okay.

297
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,533
- Are you ready for this?
- Yeah.

298
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,172
- Oh it's cold!
- Oh it's cold water!

299
00:09:23,172 --> 00:09:24,572
- [Woman] Oh yeah.

300
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:25,405
(yelling)

301
00:09:25,405 --> 00:09:26,280
- I'm sorry.

302
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,938
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh my gosh.

303
00:09:27,938 --> 00:09:30,301
- I'm sorry, I tried not to be loud.

304
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:32,647
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

305
00:09:32,647 --> 00:09:33,673
(laughing)

306
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:37,001
I'm sorry, I'm trying not to be dramatic.

307
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:38,350
Of course it's cold, what am I thinking?

308
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,721
- It's cold, once you get
your feet in, it's fine.

309
00:09:40,721 --> 00:09:42,245
Oh but it feels so tickly.

310
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:43,436
(Ellie yells)

311
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:45,731
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

312
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:47,458
- Ellie they are going ham on your feet.

313
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,068
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

314
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:51,171
- [Jared] Look at that.

315
00:09:51,171 --> 00:09:53,006
- Oh my gosh, oh my gosh,

316
00:09:53,006 --> 00:09:54,329
I'm not gonna last the three minutes.

317
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:56,484
- Oh I totally understand.
- Oh my gosh.

318
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:57,745
- It's very sucky.

319
00:09:57,745 --> 00:09:59,685
- Yeah.
- Very very sucky.

320
00:09:59,685 --> 00:10:02,689
- I am really trying
not to be dramatic here.

321
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,347
I know I just went over the top.

322
00:10:04,347 --> 00:10:05,474
This is weird.

323
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:07,491
I don't love it, I'm sorry.

324
00:10:07,491 --> 00:10:08,907
- [Jared] They're like on my legs.

325
00:10:08,907 --> 00:10:10,661
- Why did I think it would even be warm?

326
00:10:10,661 --> 00:10:11,803
Of course it's not warm.

327
00:10:11,803 --> 00:10:12,636
(Jared laughing)

328
00:10:12,636 --> 00:10:13,964
Honestly it's the weirdest thing,

329
00:10:13,964 --> 00:10:15,880
but of course you're dramatic at first,

330
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,230
how come you weren't screaming?

331
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,230
- Because it's funny.

332
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,067
It just feels so funny to me.

333
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:24,163
It just feels like
little, I don't even know,

334
00:10:24,163 --> 00:10:26,573
like little suction cups on your feet.

335
00:10:26,573 --> 00:10:28,200
- [Ellie] So it feels like sucking?

336
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,341
- [Jared] Yeah.

337
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:30,550
- [Ellie] Little nibbling.

338
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,383
- [Jared] Yeah little nibbles,

339
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,069
just like little tiny nibbles.

340
00:10:33,069 --> 00:10:34,127
- [Ellie] When I lifted my foot up,

341
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:35,554
they were still on.

342
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:37,318
I feel better now guys.

343
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,028
That was a little crazy.

344
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:40,300
I'm sorry I made a scene.

345
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,851
- No that's okay, it's funny,

346
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:43,578
like it's just weird.

347
00:10:43,578 --> 00:10:45,250
(Ellie laughs)

348
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,765
- [Ellie] It's not what I expected.

349
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,578
- Well it's a different
sensation, like your feet--

350
00:10:48,578 --> 00:10:50,781
- [Ellie] I've never felt,
I've never felt that.

351
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:52,493
- Well 'cause your feet
are always in shoes

352
00:10:52,493 --> 00:10:54,500
or socks, so any little thing like that,

353
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,375
it feels so funny.

354
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,403
- [Ellie] It almost feels like
when your foot falls asleep

355
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,536
and you're walking on needles.

356
00:10:58,536 --> 00:10:59,369
- Yeah.

357
00:10:59,369 --> 00:11:01,107
- But not as extreme, yeah.
- But not as many, yeah.

358
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:05,330
- Oh this is so, this is so woo (laughs).

359
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,342
It got to a ticklish spot.

360
00:11:07,342 --> 00:11:08,667
There's like one fish that's

361
00:11:08,667 --> 00:11:10,110
at a very ticklish spot right now.

362
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,943
(laughing)

363
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:11,776
- Oh my gosh.

364
00:11:11,776 --> 00:11:13,753
I must have a lot of dry skin on one spot.

365
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,369
This is weird.

366
00:11:15,369 --> 00:11:17,476
- [Jared] That is so cool looking.

367
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,401
How fun is this?

368
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,484
- [Ellie] Isn't that crazy?

369
00:11:19,484 --> 00:11:20,786
- You know, I just want to take care

370
00:11:20,786 --> 00:11:22,481
of my pregnant wife.

371
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,031
She's on her feet.

372
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,999
- This is something we've never done.

373
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:27,695
Thank you.
- Yeah.

374
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,258
- I wonder if Jackson would do this?

375
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,091
- [Jared] I think he would.

376
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,704
He'd probably be a little scared at first,

377
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:33,770
but then he'd probably like it.

378
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,172
- That's funny.
- Yeah.

379
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,640
- [Jared] Oh it gets in weird spots

380
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,591
and gets in between your toes.

381
00:11:38,591 --> 00:11:40,693
Okay, time to let go little fishies.

382
00:11:40,693 --> 00:11:43,739
Let go, let go, let go, let go, let go.

383
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,316
I don't want them to come out.

384
00:11:45,316 --> 00:11:47,080
They just love it.

385
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,473
As soon as you get in there,

386
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:50,857
they're like yum yum yum yum yum yum yum.

387
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,719
Yum yum yum yum yum.
- It's crazy.

388
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:54,066
- Now that we're done, how did that feel?

389
00:11:54,066 --> 00:11:56,399
- My feet feel oddly smooth.

390
00:11:57,308 --> 00:12:00,358
And I actually kinda like it.

391
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:01,748
That's an experience you guys

392
00:12:01,748 --> 00:12:03,125
are gonna have to try if would like.

393
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:03,958
- Yeah.

394
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,056
I don't know if it's the cold water

395
00:12:05,056 --> 00:12:06,435
that made me feel like that.

396
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,836
- Well I was just a
little shocked at first.

397
00:12:07,836 --> 00:12:10,121
We had a lot of people ask that were there

398
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:12,001
if they should try it, and
I was like yeah totally.

399
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:13,154
- Yeah, I think you
should definitely try it.

400
00:12:13,154 --> 00:12:16,406
It's funny, but Ellie's right,

401
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:19,073
my legs do feel smooth and good.

402
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:22,964
I don't know if they liked
my leg hair that much though.

403
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:26,119
If it lands on the left,
we're having a boy,

404
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,339
if it lands on the right,
we're having a girl.

405
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:32,481
We're having a girl!

406
00:12:32,481 --> 00:12:34,300
- Psych boy!

407
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,903
- Do you remember how
many times we did that?

408
00:12:35,903 --> 00:12:36,736
- [Ellie] Yes.

409
00:12:36,736 --> 00:12:38,317
- When we were first pregnant

410
00:12:38,317 --> 00:12:39,557
the very first time with Jackson.

411
00:12:39,557 --> 00:12:41,837
- Yes, all the time.
- All the time.

412
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:43,694
- So quick update,

413
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:46,777
so far I'm the only one having a boy.

414
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,398
- [Jared] Yes.

415
00:12:49,398 --> 00:12:51,759
- Emily's having a girl, my sister in law,

416
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,014
both sister in law
Emily's are having girls.

417
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:55,847
- [Jared] My sister--

418
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:56,786
- Julie's having a girl.

419
00:12:56,786 --> 00:12:58,650
- My sister Jennifer finds out

420
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,074
the end of this week or next week?

421
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:02,370
- [Ellie] Wednesday, tomorrow,

422
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,371
No Wednesday yeah.

423
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,400
- Wednesday, what she's having.

424
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,122
So, what if you're the
only one having a boy?

425
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,178
- That's gonna be funny.

426
00:13:11,178 --> 00:13:12,475
And it's gonna be a fun get together.

427
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,490
I'll have the only boy in the pictures,

428
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:16,926
which will be kinda cute.

429
00:13:16,926 --> 00:13:18,484
We'll see.

430
00:13:18,484 --> 00:13:19,943
I think she's having a girl.

431
00:13:19,943 --> 00:13:21,122
And I think she thinks a little bit

432
00:13:21,122 --> 00:13:22,019
that she's having a girl.

433
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,372
- [Jared] I hope she's having a girl.

434
00:13:23,372 --> 00:13:24,205
- That would be fun.

435
00:13:24,205 --> 00:13:25,116
- That would be fun.

436
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:26,868
I would really love her to have a girl.

437
00:13:26,868 --> 00:13:29,060
- Even my friend down the street,

438
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,900
she just found out she's
having a girl, Whitney.

439
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,221
- Aww fun.
- Ahhh!

440
00:13:32,221 --> 00:13:33,522
- You know what they say,

441
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:34,567
mo' happy, mo' baby.

442
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:37,864
As we walk out of our fish experience,

443
00:13:37,864 --> 00:13:40,423
Ellie and I are talking about names still

444
00:13:40,423 --> 00:13:42,599
and we just go back and forth

445
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,111
with so many different names.

446
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:45,308
- This is what I think.

447
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,654
We have a few.

448
00:13:46,654 --> 00:13:49,038
I think that we're probably just gonna--

449
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:52,006
I assume, that we'll just have him

450
00:13:52,006 --> 00:13:53,294
and then decide,

451
00:13:53,294 --> 00:13:55,111
which is weird, because
we've never done that.

452
00:13:55,111 --> 00:13:57,334
- Yeah, I can't remember how--

453
00:13:57,334 --> 00:14:00,471
we were pretty into Calvin's pregnancy

454
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:01,664
when we picked out his name.

455
00:14:01,664 --> 00:14:03,087
Because remember the
whole eight ball thing?

456
00:14:03,087 --> 00:14:05,056
That's kind of funny.
- Yeah we were about halfway.

457
00:14:05,056 --> 00:14:07,516
- It was very creepy, but I loved it.

458
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:08,647
- It was funny.

459
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:11,165
And then Jackson, we knew
before we were pregnant,

460
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,127
that we were gonna have
a boy named Jackson

461
00:14:13,127 --> 00:14:13,960
- [Ellie] And it fits.

462
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,258
- And it fits, yeah.

463
00:14:15,258 --> 00:14:18,575
But we're still just thinking of names.

464
00:14:18,575 --> 00:14:21,908
And we want it to be a good strong name.

465
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:23,910
- Thank you.

466
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,743
- You're welcome.

467
00:14:24,743 --> 00:14:25,576
It's pretty chilly out.

468
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:26,808
- Mommy, Daddy!

469
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,639
- Hi, how are ya?

470
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,669
- [Calvin] Mom!

471
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,953
- [Jared] Hi.

472
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,349
- You acted like we left you all night.

473
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:36,154
- [Jared] We were gone for an hour.

474
00:14:36,154 --> 00:14:37,848
Oh that's cool.

475
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,978
- Oh I feel like I
shouldn't take my socks off.

476
00:14:39,978 --> 00:14:42,015
- Because they're so clean and fresh?

477
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,162
- Did Jared tell you what we did?

478
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,486
- [Jared] Do you know what we did Dad?

479
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,556
- I think I heard a little bit,

480
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:50,076
but I'm not real sure.

481
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,362
- We got fish pedicures,

482
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:53,322
- [Grandpa] Ooh.

483
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:55,091
- so we stuck our feet in water

484
00:14:55,091 --> 00:14:57,514
and then the fish ate the
dead skin off our feet.

485
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,001
- Did they really do it though?

486
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:00,374
- [Jared] Yeah oh yeah.

487
00:15:00,374 --> 00:15:01,382
- [Grandpa] Did you do it too?

488
00:15:01,382 --> 00:15:02,739
- Oh yeah we both did,
we both just sat down.

489
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:03,603
- [Grandma] Did it make you laugh?

490
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,833
- Yeah it tickled, it felt weird,

491
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:06,792
they'd swim between your toes,

492
00:15:06,792 --> 00:15:08,254
they'd suck between your toes.

493
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:10,146
- Oh gross.
- Oh man.

494
00:15:10,146 --> 00:15:12,730
- [Jared] We made a reservation
for you guys tomorrow.

495
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:13,563
- No.

496
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:14,435
(laughing)

497
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,156
- Da da da!

498
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:18,735
- [Jared] Did you help
Grandpa finish his puzzle?

499
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:19,568
- Uh-huh.

500
00:15:19,568 --> 00:15:21,589
- [Jared] That's so fun.

501
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,795
Aww, that's so great.

502
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:26,962
I'm sure he needed all the
help he could get, huh?

503
00:15:28,718 --> 00:15:30,060
Did you make that?

504
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,893
- Yeah.

505
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:31,861
- [Jared] That's cool Calvin.

506
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:34,166
It's so good to see you boys.

507
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,666
- We bargained for it, what did we decide?

508
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:41,475
- I will give you one of my shiny ones

509
00:15:41,475 --> 00:15:43,650
and you will give me these.

510
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,906
- And how come we gave you two?

511
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:47,656
- Because I want two.

512
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,421
- You wanted one for Calvin.

513
00:15:50,421 --> 00:15:52,691
And I thought that was really special.

514
00:15:52,691 --> 00:15:54,002
He made the bargain with me,

515
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,633
but then he wanted one more for Calvin.

516
00:15:55,633 --> 00:15:56,511
- One more for Calvin.

517
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,666
So does that mean you're gonna
give another rock to Grandma?

518
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,977
So Grandpa can have one?

519
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:01,810
Yeah.

520
00:16:02,932 --> 00:16:05,765
So Jackson's birthday is tomorrow.

521
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,649
So tomorrow we're gonna be
celebrating Jackson's birthday,

522
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:11,868
but the weather might
be kinda bad tomorrow,

523
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:14,365
so I think Grandma and
Grandpa have decided

524
00:16:14,365 --> 00:16:18,599
that they want to have a little
birthday party right now.

525
00:16:18,599 --> 00:16:19,938
Jackson, how cool is that?

526
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:20,876
Oh you're putting those back,

527
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,452
that's so sweet.

528
00:16:22,452 --> 00:16:23,457
Did you know that Grandma and Grandpa

529
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:25,368
want to celebrate your birthday right now

530
00:16:25,368 --> 00:16:26,733
because you're here with them?

531
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,566
- Uh-huh.

532
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:28,663
- [Jared] Is that pretty cool?

533
00:16:28,663 --> 00:16:29,496
- I think when we get there,
he'll be more excited.

534
00:16:29,496 --> 00:16:31,554
- Would you rather open your presents

535
00:16:31,554 --> 00:16:33,221
tonight or tomorrow?

536
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:36,319
- Tonight.

00:16:39,073 --> 00:16:40,808
Grandpa's got a candle.

00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:42,195
And we're gonna sing Happy Birthday.

541
00:16:42,195 --> 00:16:44,008
And Calvin's gonna blow it out.

He's like no I want to do it.

567
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,050
one little nibble of those tiny cookies.

(Jared laughing)

569
00:17:52,235 --> 00:17:53,068

00:17:53,068 --> 00:17:54,171
- [Jared] That was cute.

571
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:55,446

00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:56,823
- [Jared] Yeah he's like arrrr.

573
00:17:56,823 --> 00:18:00,596
And Jackson guess what,

little present right here,

575
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:05,670
and I think you can open that tonight.

576
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,679
Do you want to do that?

577
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:07,917

Look at this wrapping paper.

I love this wrapping paper.

581
00:18:12,196 --> 00:18:14,173
It reminds me of handkerchiefs.

582
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:16,727
Are you gonna open it fast or slow?

583
00:18:16,727 --> 00:18:17,679
- Slow.

584
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:22,522
- [Jared] You like to take
your time with it, huh?

585
00:18:22,522 --> 00:18:24,572
- It's just a box.

586
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:26,358
- What did you say?

587
00:18:26,358 --> 00:18:28,335
- I wish you had your pocketknife.

00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:30,597
- Oh that's too sweet.

589
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:33,072

590
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:35,655
- Make Grandma proud.

- [Jared] Stuff your mouth full.

602
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:57,751
Stuff it full.

603
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,812

a private birthday with
Grandma and Grandpa

623
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:29,989

(blowing)

643
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:22,817
- [Jared] So that's how
dinosaurs got extinct.

644
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,329
- [Ellie] That's all I have to do.

645
00:20:24,329 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
