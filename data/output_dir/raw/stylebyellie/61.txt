1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,870
- The first one to find Mommy's phone

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:04,300
gets to keep it.

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,100
In revenge!

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,350
- I'm so excited.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,213
This is so fun.

6
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:09,210
(yelling)

7
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,640
- I had my AirPods that I was putting away

8
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,000
and it fell in here.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No no no!

10
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,060
Good morning my young child,

11
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,558
how are you doing today?

12
00:00:20,558 --> 00:00:22,840
Good morning my young child,

13
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,150
how are you doing today?

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,221
You stinky bum.

15
00:00:25,221 --> 00:00:26,640
(Jared laughs)

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,140
Okay boys, here's the deal.

17
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,830
We are gonna start off the morning

18
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,170
kinda how we did yesterday.

19
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,360
Mom has misplaced her phone.

20
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,130
And we're going to have a little contest,

21
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,628
okay Jackson, do you remember this from--

22
00:00:37,628 --> 00:00:38,559
- She lost her?

23
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,300
- She lost her phone yeah.

24
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,950
So the first one to find Mommy's phone

25
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,838
gets to keep it.

26
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,660
Okay?

27
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,980
So let's find Mommy's phone, okay?

28
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:50,813
- Okay.

29
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:51,646
- And the first one to find it,

30
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:52,479
gets to keep it.

31
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,312
Let's race!

32
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:54,145
(laughing)

33
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm gonna go tell Ellie

34
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,700
what I just did, in revenge!

35
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,802
Good morning.

36
00:00:58,802 --> 00:00:59,635
- You found it?

37
00:00:59,635 --> 00:01:02,020
- [Jared] No, I just told the kids,

38
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,310
the first person to find Mommy's phone

39
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,605
gets to keep it.

40
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:06,929
- Did you get it?

41
00:01:06,929 --> 00:01:07,762
- Nope.

42
00:01:07,762 --> 00:01:08,595
- We gotta start
- Go get it.

43
00:01:08,595 --> 00:01:09,428
- looking for it.

44
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:11,563
(laughing)

45
00:01:11,563 --> 00:01:12,670
Is it behind here?

46
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,947
Is it behind the bed?

47
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:14,970
It might be under the bed.

48
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,050
Is that it?

49
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,930
Is that it right there?

50
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,980
- [Jackson] I found your wallet Dad.

51
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,890
- [Jared] You found my wallet?

52
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:23,923
Oh thanks bud, that's not
part of the contest anymore.

53
00:01:23,923 --> 00:01:27,090
(lively guitar music)

54
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,750
Let's see if we call her, that might help.

55
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,192
- [On Phone] Your call has been forwarded

56
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:37,025
to an automated message center.

57
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:37,858
- Oh great, it's dead.

58
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:38,890
Her phone's dead,

59
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,361
this is going to make
it much more difficult.

60
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:44,528
(lively guitar music)

61
00:01:45,702 --> 00:01:46,535
Nope.

62
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,310
Do you know where Mom's phone is?

63
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,350
- (growls) Up.

64
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,183
- [Jared] Upstairs?

65
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:51,244
Do you know where it is?

66
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:52,077
- No.

67
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:52,910
- Guess what?

68
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,030
I do.

69
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,170
I found it.

70
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,150
It's right here.

71
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:57,983
I found it!

72
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,830
I don't know how we didn't see it earlier.

73
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,150
Alright Jackson, I found the phone.

74
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,810
Do you want to give it back to Mom?

75
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,643
Do you want to go give it to her?

76
00:02:04,643 --> 00:02:06,620
Okay, go give it to her.

77
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,850
Say we found it Mom.

78
00:02:08,812 --> 00:02:10,249
- You found it.

79
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,410
Where was it?

80
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,798
- It was on the car mat, like the road.

81
00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:16,093
I was just like how did I not even see--

82
00:02:16,093 --> 00:02:17,000
- Well I hid it so well, thank you.

83
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,569
- [Jared] I guess, pink on road.

84
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:20,670
- Thank you.

85
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,236
- [Jared] We did it
together didn't we boys?

86
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:23,069
- [Ellie] Thanks.

87
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:25,290
- Jackson's a little upset
that he didn't find it.

88
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,380
But guess what Jackson--

89
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,480
- But you know what, you gave it to me.

90
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,330
- [Jared] Yeah, and you
found my wallet yesterday,

91
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,829
so that's a major point for Daddy.

92
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,662
- Jacks.

93
00:02:31,662 --> 00:02:33,600
- I wanted to keep it.

94
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,324
- You can hold it, let's go charge it.

95
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:36,532
- [Calvin] Yeah.

96
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:37,599
- [Ellie] Good stuff.

97
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,860
- [Jared] Hey, not all is lost, okay boys?

98
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,693
Okay?

99
00:02:40,693 --> 00:02:41,910
High five, thanks for your help.

100
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:43,628
(Jared laughs)

101
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:45,274
- [Ellie] Calvin, what are you getting?

102
00:02:45,274 --> 00:02:46,107
- I want my dog.

103
00:02:46,107 --> 00:02:47,247
- [Ellie] Your dog?

104
00:02:47,247 --> 00:02:48,080
- Yeah.

105
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,203
Here's my dog.

106
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,287
- [Ellie] You got your doggie?

107
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:55,370
(bright jazzy music)

108
00:02:59,425 --> 00:03:02,417
- I feel like I'm wearing
the wrong outfit today guys.

109
00:03:02,417 --> 00:03:05,025
- [Man] You're the one that stands out.

110
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,520
- Today we are skiing

111
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,860
and I'm meeting up with
some good buddies of mine.

112
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,390
I think I see them over there.

113
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,266
Hey, I could tell that
purple jacket from anywhere.

114
00:03:15,266 --> 00:03:16,240
(laughing)

115
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,110
What's up Zack?

116
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,749
Dan, Chaz, how's it going?

117
00:03:18,749 --> 00:03:19,582
- Ciao.

118
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:21,310
- Ready for epic snow,
the powder is killer.

119
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,380
- Is it really dude?

120
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,213
I heard.

121
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,168
We had a major storm come in yesterday.

122
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:26,280
- [Dan] Yeah it dumped, it dumped.

123
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,270
- Dumped ice everywhere.

124
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,264
- There's a run right over there

125
00:03:28,264 --> 00:03:30,110
that you will just die for.

126
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,120
- So this is my first time skiing,

127
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,152
so Zack, will you teach me everything

128
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,440
you know about skiing?

129
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,273
- Yeah yeah I got you.

130
00:03:35,273 --> 00:03:36,978
- [Jared] Thanks.

131
00:03:36,978 --> 00:03:38,350
(yelling)
(funky upbeat music)

132
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,397
- I know I put perfume on this morning

133
00:03:39,397 --> 00:03:42,294
for the first time in months.

134
00:03:42,294 --> 00:03:44,440
I feel so good.

135
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,850
My feet are scrubbed.
- Awww.

136
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,330
- My body's exfoliated.

137
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,280
Jared put Band-Aids on my moles

138
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,210
that are healing.

139
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,043
(Bonnie laughing)

140
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:52,660
He put Neosporin on that.

141
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,470
He thought his was getting infected.

142
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,303
- [Bonnie] Oh no.

143
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56,760
- It's bad, but they're
good, they're healing.

144
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,660
But other than that,

145
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,800
- Your nails are done,

146
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,330
my nails are done,

147
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,410
- Look at this.
- We brought our jewelry.

148
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,980
- [Bonnie] Polished.

149
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,800
- We are all spruced up
ready for our photo shoot.

150
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,613
- Yay!

151
00:04:07,613 --> 00:04:08,446
Oh my shirt's tucked into my pants.

152
00:04:08,446 --> 00:04:11,940
- [Ellie] This has been a
long time in the making girl.

153
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,773
- I'm so excited.

154
00:04:12,773 --> 00:04:13,622
This is so fun.

155
00:04:13,622 --> 00:04:14,990
(yelling)

156
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:15,929
- I know it's like bring--

157
00:04:15,929 --> 00:04:17,470
well Jared's like just relax,

158
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,610
and have fun, he goes put loud music on

159
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,500
while you do the photo shoot.

160
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,916
- Yes.
- I'm like yes.

161
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,917
- Yes honey.

162
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,179
(jazzy bright music)

163
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,690
- We're gonna try something fun.

164
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,570
I'm gonna film Dan for
a little bit skiing.

165
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,880
He's fast, so it's gonna be
hard to keep up with him.

166
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,930
And then as we get to a certain point,

167
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,860
I'm gonna toss the GoPro to him,

168
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,660
you will catch it, right?

169
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,026
- I may or may not.

170
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:01,157
We'll see.
- And

171
00:05:01,157 --> 00:05:03,626
- we've got Zack on backup, just in case

172
00:05:03,626 --> 00:05:06,670
the GoPro goes down and
then we'll go from there.

173
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,264
Sound like a plan?

174
00:05:08,264 --> 00:05:09,120
- Sounds like a plan,
- Ready?

175
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,620
- teamwork exercise.
- Break.

176
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,592
- Let's do it.

177
00:05:11,592 --> 00:05:14,675
(bright jazzy music)

178
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,773
- Ready?

179
00:05:22,773 --> 00:05:23,606
- Toss it.

180
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,760
Yah, we did it!

181
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:29,584
Here we go.

182
00:05:32,655 --> 00:05:34,694
- I got ya, yeah!

183
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:35,810
(laughs)

184
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,770
Those are our two perfect auditions.

185
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,324
- [Dan] Do one to Zack.

186
00:05:39,324 --> 00:05:40,435
- Ready?

187
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:41,935
- [Zack] Throw it.

188
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,920
- That run was a lot
shorter than I thought.

189
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,070
As soon as you tossed it to me,

190
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,661
it was like okay, we're
at the end of the run.

191
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:50,494
(laughs)

192
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:51,327
- Yeah.

193
00:05:51,327 --> 00:05:52,160
- Just to give you an idea

194
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,510
of how bad the mountain is right now,

195
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:58,600
all of those red X's are closed hills.

196
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,830
There's three green ones that are open.

197
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,160
So it's a pretty bad day on the mountain

198
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,991
but we're making the best of it.

199
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,160
It hasn't been too terrible with ice,

200
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,660
but there has been a lot of spots

201
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,270
where there's exposed rock and weeds

202
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,630
and that sort of thing.

203
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:18,590
(funky upbeat music)

204
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:22,270
- It was a little crazy.

205
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,140
We had one minute left until we had

206
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,973
to get out of here.

207
00:06:24,973 --> 00:06:26,879
One minute.
- Seriously, we bumped it.

208
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:27,804
- This is intense,

209
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,150
do you think it's gonna turn out good?

210
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,269
- I'm crossing my fingers,

211
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:31,240
but I think it will.

212
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,073
- I think so too.

213
00:06:32,073 --> 00:06:33,526
We had fun.
- Do you?

214
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:34,359
- If you had fun with it,

215
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,470
usually it turns out well.

216
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,010
- Let's do this, round two.

217
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,898
- [Zack] There you go, it's right there.

218
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,027
- Waa!

219
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:41,589
(laughing)

220
00:06:41,589 --> 00:06:44,000
- Alright, I think it's
our last run of the day.

221
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,700
Just a beautiful sight to see today.

222
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,783
(jazzy bright music)

223
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,850
- I, I suck hard.

224
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:55,683
Meager attempt.

225
00:07:00,274 --> 00:07:02,524
(crashing)

226
00:07:04,727 --> 00:07:06,050
My fault, terrible throw.

227
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,960
- No dude, you're okay.
- Terrible throw, my bad.

228
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,958
- [Jared] It wasn't a bad throw.

229
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,290
I wasn't going fast enough.

230
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,650
Dan's a speed demon, you
gotta keep up with Dan.

231
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,483
No no no!

232
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,930
I had my AirPods that I was putting away,

233
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:19,920
I have one in here,

234
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,020
one in here, and I was
taking one out of my ear

235
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,050
and putting it away

236
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,050
and it fell in here, like
in the emergency brake.

237
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,100
Shoot, how am I gonna get this out?

238
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,933
Oh man.

239
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,170
Gosh dangit.

240
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,660
Oh my heavens to Betsy,

241
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,660
there is no way.

242
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,690
Gosh dangit.

243
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,007
Hold please.

244
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:48,660
(machine humming)

245
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,260
- Can you hear the rock tumbler?

246
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,360
I think it only has five more days.

247
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,500
Our photo shoot was done,

248
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,930
it is cold outside,

249
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,450
so I am just doing
chores around the house,

250
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,870
getting things picked up and cleaned up

251
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,150
before the kids get home.

252
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,330
Bonnie and I had a really
big photos hoot today.

253
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,290
I'm sure you guys are
sick of hearing that,

254
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,010
because you're like, well
what is this photo shoot?

255
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:08,040
Bonnie and I have a fun project

256
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,790
that has been a year in the making.

257
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,510
Do not eat my orange juice Penny.

258
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,850
And we just did photo shoots,

259
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,580
we are finalizing everything,

260
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,700
and we will let you guys know very soon,

261
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,980
but we are so excited
and it was just so fun.

262
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,380
And Miss Penny's gonna
help me do the dishes now.

263
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,590
I hope Dad got good snow today,

264
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,140
he's skiing up in Park City.

265
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,340
I hope he got good snow.

266
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,280
If it's raining here,

267
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,260
it's probably snowing where he's at.

268
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,390
- So I spent five minutes trying

269
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:35,500
to get my AirPod out of
the emergency brake thing

270
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,960
and I think it's gone.

271
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,020
- Oh no.

272
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,852
- Yeah, I think it's gone.

273
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:39,685
- Whoa, we can get it.

274
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,010
We have Zack tonight, let's get Zack,

275
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,950
he can probably take
the thing apart easily.

276
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,910
- I was gonna say, he
probably has some of his--

277
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,850
- He's got the tools in his car.

278
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,120
- Right now.
- Yes.

279
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,562
- Oh good, oh I'm so
glad we're doing this.

280
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,395
(Dan laughs)

281
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,610
Okay so chance of plans,
I was gonna go home,

282
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,740
Dan was gonna go home,
- Yeah.

283
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,250
- Zack was gonna go home,

284
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,450
but we're here in Park
City during Sundance

285
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,330
and we got invited a dinner

286
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,500
with an ad agency that it's
beneficial for all of us,

287
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,740
so Dan, Zack and I are staying,

288
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,220
and we're gonna have dinner, but--

289
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,330
- The problem is, I'm wearing
these Nike sweatpants.

290
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,360
- Yeah, and I have these shorts

291
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,070
with Spandex on underneath,
and I'm not sure

292
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,903
if the ad agency
- No.

293
00:09:15,903 --> 00:09:17,969
- would really enjoy having dinner with us

294
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:19,600
looking like this.
- These are fancy people.

295
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,875
- Fancy people that probably
come from LA and New York.

296
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,708
- [Jared] Yeah.

297
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:23,541
- and they're here in Utah.

298
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:24,374
They wouldn't go skiing.

299
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:25,491
They're probably just,

300
00:09:25,491 --> 00:09:27,250
get the clothes for this day.
- In the suits and--

301
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,083
- So yeah.
- Yeah.

302
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,950
- So Dan and I have decided

303
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,650
that we were gonna go to the outlets

304
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:32,970
and get some nicer clothes,

305
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,700
clean ourselves up a little bit

306
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,715
and go to dinner.

307
00:09:35,715 --> 00:09:38,882
(bluesy upbeat music)

308
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,263
Okay Zack, now that you've
seen our new outfits,

309
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:49,096
- Yes.

310
00:09:49,096 --> 00:09:49,929
- you gotta give us the rating,

311
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,410
like who wore it better?

312
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,190
- Okay, so what's new,
you got the new jeans--

313
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,023
- Everything.

314
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:54,856
- You got new everything,

315
00:09:54,856 --> 00:09:55,689
wow, okay.
- New everything.

316
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:56,522
- Except the shoes, the shoes are mine.

317
00:09:56,522 --> 00:09:58,300
- I hope you got a discount on the jeans,

318
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,270
because they're missing some fabric.

319
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:02,096
- [Jared] Buy one, get one.

320
00:10:02,096 --> 00:10:02,929
(laughs)

321
00:10:02,929 --> 00:10:03,762
- But other than that,

322
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:04,595
I feel like you did a good job.

323
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:05,900
You got the nice soft liner

324
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,000
inside of the hoodie.

325
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,770
Okay, good with the hat.
- Feel the material on this.

326
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,603
- Is the hat new,

327
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:10,436
are you going hunting later today?

328
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:12,200
Is that, okay, cool cool.
- Yeah.

329
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,033
- I just didn't want you to see

330
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:15,970
the giant mole that's
on the back of my head.

331
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,490
So covered it up a little.
- Win some, you lose some.

332
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,830
- Look, you can see it's water resistant.

333
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,360
There's beads of water on top of the hat.

334
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
- [Dan] Very good observation.

335
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,420
- I am not the fashion guy in the room.

336
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,670
I'm wearing a hoodie,

337
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,110
so I would rate you 7.8.

338
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,743
- That's above average.

339
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:38,120
- Alright.
- Above average, okay.

340
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,166
- [Jared] Let's see what you got for Dan.

341
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:39,999
- [Zack] Dan?

342
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,850
- Alright, so this is not new,

343
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,160
neither are the dorky shoes.

344
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,670
- [Zack] Okay, but the hat?

345
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,820
- [Jared] When you say dorky shoes,

346
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,900
you say Yeezy's?

347
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,733
- Yeezy's.

348
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,180
- [Jared] Okay, ah jeez.

349
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:50,770
- He's bringing it up a notch.
- The blue belt is new.

350
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,603
- [Zack] The blue belt's new, okay.

351
00:10:51,603 --> 00:10:52,890
- [Jared] Oh I didn't
know they have belts.

352
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,070
- The thing that I think is interesting

353
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,310
is today when we went skiing,

354
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,100
you were just in solid gray

355
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,933
everything was gray,
- That's true.

356
00:10:57,933 --> 00:10:59,650
- and now that you went shopping,

357
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,560
you purchased all gray again,

358
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,400
except for the blue belt.

359
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,280
- It must be the color.

360
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,630
- It's the theme of the day.

361
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,630
- Yeah.

362
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,790
- Yeah, 7.8, I'll go 7.9

363
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,040
just the button up shirt, man.
- Woo.

364
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
- The button up shirt.

365
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,744
- The button up shirt is nice.

366
00:11:12,744 --> 00:11:13,577
- [Dan] That's good.

367
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:15,060
- I would take a .1 loss
to a button up shirt.

368
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,040
- If we both round it, we're both eights.

369
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,390
- [Jared] Okay, we'll round up.

370
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,750
- Yeah, round up.

371
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,133
- Solid eights, good job.

372
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:22,014
(Jared laughing)

373
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,037
(playful music)

374
00:11:24,037 --> 00:11:24,900
(flushing)

375
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,060
- [Ellie] Good job!

376
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,802
Say good job.

377
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:28,730
- Good job.

378
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,570
- [Ellie] Good job Cal.

379
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,494
Alright, now this Mama
needs to clean up a mess.

380
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,510
(Ellie laughs)

381
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,950
It may have gotten all over the toilet.

382
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,500
- So here is the update.

383
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,770
We had dinner.

384
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,160
It was really great.

385
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,640
And it snowed about four or five inches

386
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,100
and the canyons are just really bad,

387
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,520
so I'm crashing here at my buddy's place,

388
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,000
and then I'm going to leave
and go home tomorrow morning,

389
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,820
because the roads are just
too bad for me to drive.

390
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,350
And I'm stranded in Park City right now.

391
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,100
That is where I'm gonna leave you guys.

392
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,570
Hope you have a wonderful day

393
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,020
and we'll see you guys tomorrow,

394
00:12:05,020 --> 00:00:00,000
when I hopefully can get home, bye.
