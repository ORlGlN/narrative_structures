1
00:00:00,307 --> 00:00:03,182
- And I just feel a little.

2
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:04,451
I'm just gonna show you how I feel.

3
00:00:04,451 --> 00:00:05,500
I just feel--

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:06,880
- [Jared] Who's birthday is it today?

5
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,738
- [Jackson] Bonnie!

6
00:00:07,738 --> 00:00:08,765
- I kinda get sick at night,

7
00:00:08,765 --> 00:00:11,090
like it really hits me
really bad at night.

8
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,996
She's probably gonna return it.

9
00:00:11,996 --> 00:00:12,829
(laughs)

10
00:00:12,829 --> 00:00:13,662
- What?

11
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:14,609
- [Jared] What?

12
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,376
- It's an inside joke.
You'll know what it is.

13
00:00:16,376 --> 00:00:20,293
Well, today I got beat
up, eight vials of blood

14
00:00:21,508 --> 00:00:22,920
and a flu shot.

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,601
(laughs)

16
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,434
Hold on.

17
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:27,920
Gonna make you sick.

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,924
Now, run.

19
00:00:28,924 --> 00:00:31,007
(laughs)

20
00:00:36,581 --> 00:00:37,692
Ready? Got your shoes on?

21
00:00:37,692 --> 00:00:38,525
- Yep!

22
00:00:38,525 --> 00:00:39,442
- Let's go!

23
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,517
K, got you dizzy.

24
00:00:43,517 --> 00:00:45,139
Let's go.

25
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:46,617
I got a lot of blood work done today.

26
00:00:46,617 --> 00:00:48,784
I got like eight vials of blood taken.

27
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:50,064
- Are you feeling a little dizzy?

28
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,769
- Actually, when she was
doing it, I was feeling like,

29
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:55,128
"Ugh, I'm ready for this to
be done," and a flu shot.

30
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:57,604
- Even if you're dizzy,
I'll always support you.

31
00:00:57,604 --> 00:00:58,731
- Thanks.

32
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:00,347
- Support.

33
00:01:00,347 --> 00:01:02,960
- I told Jared that I was
gonna film in Hobby Lobby,

34
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,501
and then I raced in
there, grabbed my stuff,

35
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:09,130
and raced out, and I was
like, "I totally didn't film".

36
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:11,337
I have a little mini haul for you guys,

37
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:14,634
but, first, today is the
day that we put our video up

38
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:16,676
for the birth announcement,
and I'm sure Jared's gonna

39
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:21,644
wanna talk about it later,
and our nerves have been

40
00:01:21,644 --> 00:01:23,917
very on edge the last few weeks,

41
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,683
and I'm just I feel really good today.

42
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:29,422
I got so much blood work done today,

43
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,184
and things are looking
good, and I'm feeling sick

44
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,891
which is awesome, and I'm just grateful

45
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:38,375
for everyone's positive feedback,

46
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:41,863
but you guys know, for
church, I am in charge

47
00:01:41,863 --> 00:01:46,435
of activity days, and that
is for different age groups,

48
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,046
but my age group is nine year olds.

49
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:50,804
All the nine year old girls,
they come twice a month,

50
00:01:50,804 --> 00:01:53,739
and, for my activity day
tomorrow, activity day.

51
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,115
Am I saying that annoyingly?

52
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:59,282
The activity for tomorrow
for activity days (laughs)

53
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,700
we went to Lowe's, and we had
a bunch of wood blocks cut.

54
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,146
This was an example I got at Hobby Lobby,

55
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:08,475
and then I had a bunch cut.

56
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:11,949
We're gonna be making countdown
markers for Christmas.

57
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:14,826
They have a flat thing that this goes on

58
00:02:14,826 --> 00:02:18,723
and then two little markers,
and they will decorate them

59
00:02:18,723 --> 00:02:20,306
with holiday paper.

60
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:26,456
I wanna show you some holiday
paper that we are gonna cut,

61
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:28,539
and they are going to glue on there,

62
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:30,848
and they're gonna make little countdowns,

63
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:34,048
and I couldn't find
any countdown stickers,

64
00:02:34,048 --> 00:02:38,085
and the ones that I found were expensive.

65
00:02:38,085 --> 00:02:40,049
I ended up getting the ink ones,

66
00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:41,671
so if they can just put this in ink

67
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:44,167
and then put it on their
block for the countdown

68
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:46,768
for Christmas, and then I also am going to

69
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:48,565
print out the nativity.

70
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:51,665
It's like a mini nativity
book, and we'll color it,

71
00:02:51,665 --> 00:02:53,726
and we'll go over the nativity, you know,

72
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:55,020
what Christmas means, so we'll kinda get

73
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,929
a little fun activity and
serious, but it's all fun.

74
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:01,821
I'm excited to do that tomorrow.

75
00:03:01,821 --> 00:03:05,445
I get kinda anxious and
antsy when it's my turn.

76
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:08,891
I switch off with my partner,
but we do that every month,

77
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:10,733
and I get so anxious when it comes up,

78
00:03:10,733 --> 00:03:12,726
because it's like I'm kinda of having

79
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:14,217
to entertain nine year olds.

80
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:16,565
I wanna do an activity
that's fun for them,

81
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,620
and not every month is like a fun craft,

82
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,180
like some is just like more of a lesson,

83
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,763
and some's a craft.

84
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:23,923
I get a little anxious,

85
00:03:23,923 --> 00:03:25,675
but, now that it's here, I'm excited.

86
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:29,087
It's tomorrow night, and I've
talked about this before,

87
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,328
but I don't know if I've ever said,

88
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:32,162
because there's a lot of
you guys all over the world

89
00:03:32,162 --> 00:03:34,750
that watches: it's for
anyone that's welcome.

90
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,880
You don't have to be, you
know, in the church to go.

91
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,367
If you contact a local
LDS church, they can get

92
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:43,954
in contact with the activity leaders,

93
00:03:43,954 --> 00:03:45,003
and then you can get in.

94
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:47,168
You can let them know
that your kids wanna go,

95
00:03:47,168 --> 00:03:49,011
and they'll invite them, and they can go,

96
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:51,060
and it's just really fun.

97
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,840
That's what I'm doing.

98
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,796
I told Jared that I'd film,
and then I left the camera,

99
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:57,522
so I wanted to show you
guys what I was up to,

100
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:00,377
but it's Bonnie's birthday,
and we're gonna go over

101
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:02,834
for some cupcakes, and
I got her a little gift.

102
00:04:02,834 --> 00:04:07,480
I hope she loves it, and
I just feel a little.

103
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,511
I'm just gonna show you how I feel.

104
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:11,128
I just feel, I feel excited. (laughs)

105
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:13,836
I feel like my emotions are up and down,

106
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,394
and it's crazy, and
this is really exciting,

107
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:18,591
but it's so nerve wracking,
and I feel like every time

108
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,342
I say excited, I have
to say nerve wracking,

109
00:04:21,343 --> 00:04:23,023
'cause that's exactly how I feel.

110
00:04:23,023 --> 00:04:24,062
It's like the moment I get excited,

111
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:26,654
then I have to sit back
and be like I don't know.

112
00:04:26,654 --> 00:04:29,189
It's just, it's crazy.

113
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:33,356
I'm in such a stage in life
where I have my young kids,

114
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:37,727
and we're trying to grow our family,

115
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,381
and, at least, how Jared and
I have always wanted to do it,

116
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,029
we haven't wanted to have, like, two kids

117
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:43,888
and then have like a
10-year, seven-year break.

118
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:45,934
We've just kinda wanted to have our kids

119
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,379
and then be done.

120
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:49,663
We feel like that time is right,

121
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:51,389
and I don't know.

122
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,556
It's just we're in a fun and
weird stage of life right now

123
00:04:57,265 --> 00:04:59,389
where we have our young
kids, and we're trying

124
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:03,403
to grow our family, and it's
been an emotional few months,

125
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,720
but I'm glad that we
are here where we're at,

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,588
and I'm really grateful
for a really strong baby,

127
00:05:09,588 --> 00:05:13,019
and I've heard so many good
news the last few days.

128
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,437
A lot of my friends, especially
my old salon friends,

129
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:18,891
a few of them have had a few miscarriages,

130
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:21,603
and I've recently talked to
them, and they are expecting,

131
00:05:21,603 --> 00:05:22,723
and I'm so happy for them,

132
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,205
but there's also so much sad news,.

133
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,327
I don't know if they
want me to talk about it.

134
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,654
I don't wanna draw attention,
but just, one of my friends,

135
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:32,126
she's going through a process,

136
00:05:32,126 --> 00:05:33,812
and things aren't looking well right now,

137
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:36,902
and it's just making
me really sad for her,

138
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:39,297
so just so many ups and
downs, and I'm so grateful

139
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,040
for everybody's support, and
I'm also grateful for cupcakes.

140
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,342
Let's go to Bonnie's and
eat a cupcake. (laughs)

141
00:05:45,342 --> 00:05:46,667
- [Jared] Whose birthday is it today?

142
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,500
- [Jackson] Bonnie!

143
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,582
- [Jared] And what do
you have right there?

144
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:50,415
- Her present.

145
00:05:50,415 --> 00:05:51,354
- [Jared] Should we go give it to her?

146
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:52,187
- Yeah.

147
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,369
- [Jared] Okay, let's
go, let's go, let's go.

148
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:54,597
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

149
00:05:54,597 --> 00:05:55,430
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

150
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,548
- Jackson, come give me a hug.

151
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:01,277
- [Jared] Look at him staying
on the dry part of the cement.

152
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,670
Hi, guys.

153
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,318
Hi, Link.

154
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:05,151
(laughs)
- What?

155
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,984
(crosstalk)

156
00:06:05,984 --> 00:06:06,940
- [Jared] There he goes.

157
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,773
- I told Calvin.

158
00:06:07,773 --> 00:06:09,306
I said, "You be nice to Lincoln".

159
00:06:09,306 --> 00:06:11,140
They kinda have a love/hate relationship.

160
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,882
- [Jared] Yes, as all little boys do.

161
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:15,159
- [Ellie] Hi.

162
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:17,461
(crosstalk)

163
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,677
- [Jared] Hello, how are you?

164
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:21,730
Hi.

165
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,937
Look at you, Ms. Stylin'.

166
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,200
- Thanks.

167
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,033
- [Jared] Yeah.

168
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:27,091
- How are you guys?

169
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:28,275
- [Jared] Hi, Link.

170
00:06:28,275 --> 00:06:30,813
(shouting)

171
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,022
(laughs)

172
00:06:32,022 --> 00:06:34,772
- Raspberry frosting, lemon cake.

173
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:37,655
Happy birthday to me.

174
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:39,315
(laughs)

175
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,534
Thank you, Bon.

176
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,894
- Happy birthday to me.

177
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,765
- No, happy birthday to me.

178
00:06:45,765 --> 00:06:47,985
- No, happy birthday to me.

179
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:49,846
(laughs)

180
00:06:49,846 --> 00:06:51,096
- [Jared] Happy birthday, Bonnie.

181
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:52,386
- Thank you.

182
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,904
- [Jackson] Om nom nom nom nom.

183
00:06:53,904 --> 00:06:54,812
- Really good.

184
00:06:54,812 --> 00:06:55,979
- This is really good.

185
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,838
Bonnie, you need to go on
Cupcake Wars. (mumbling)

186
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:00,941
- Jared said that five minutes ago.

187
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,124
It was funny then.

188
00:07:02,124 --> 00:07:04,305
Don't laugh.
(mumbling)

189
00:07:04,305 --> 00:07:05,592
Here's your present.

190
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,278
I have to tell you.

191
00:07:07,278 --> 00:07:10,442
I was looking online for over an hour--

192
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,275
- [Bonnie] Really?

193
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,724
- And I still couldn't
find the one I wanted,

194
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,982
and Jared says she's
probably gonna return it.

195
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:16,836
(laughs)

196
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:17,669
- What?

197
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:18,502
- [Jared] What?

198
00:07:18,502 --> 00:07:20,061
- It's an inside joke.
You'll know what it is.

199
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:20,894
- [Bonnie] Okay.

200
00:07:20,894 --> 00:07:25,029
- But I'm sure you'll
love it, but just to know

201
00:07:25,029 --> 00:07:26,513
I looked for a long time
and still couldn't find

202
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,804
the one I really wanted.

203
00:07:27,804 --> 00:07:29,699
- Okay, I'm sure it's great.

204
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,253
- [Boston] Uh uh, Calvin, uh uh.

205
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:32,325
- Is it flammable?

206
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:35,004
- I have no idea, but I like the package.

207
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:38,744
Oh my gosh, why on
Earth would I return it?

208
00:07:38,744 --> 00:07:40,427
- [Ellie] 'Cause you return any jewelry.

209
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:42,486
(laughs)

210
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:43,598
- I usually do.

211
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:44,739
- [Ellie] I'm saying that in a loving way.

212
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:45,972
(laughs)

213
00:07:45,972 --> 00:07:47,150
- Oh thanks, Joel.

214
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,849
Let's see what I'm dealing with.

215
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,173
No, that's so cute.

216
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:53,495
I absolutely love it.

217
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:54,328
- [Olivia] Mom, can I see it?

218
00:07:54,328 --> 00:07:57,299
- I wanted to get the
pull one, and I looked,

219
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:59,781
and I could not find it anywhere.

220
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:03,213
- Well, I looked, and I couldn't
find it anywhere either.

221
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,571
I love it, Ellie and Jared.

222
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:06,404
Thank you.

223
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,237
- [Jared] You're welcome. Happy birthday.

224
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,070
- [Bonnie] I love it.

225
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,292
- [Jared] I haven't got
a close look of it yet.

226
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:10,775
That looks so fun.

227
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:14,269
- And I found BaubleBar from
Ellie, and I love their stuff.

228
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:15,653
Ellie, I love it.

229
00:08:15,653 --> 00:08:16,486
Thank you.

230
00:08:16,486 --> 00:08:17,319
- You're welcome.

231
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,152
It'll be cute.

232
00:08:18,152 --> 00:08:19,598
We have, like, a few gold necklaces,

233
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:20,779
but that's a little different.

234
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,029
It's kinda fun.

235
00:08:23,687 --> 00:08:25,572
(laughs)

236
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,286
- I'll protect you, young one.

237
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:30,926
- Says the one that just
scratched Lincoln's face.

238
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:34,160
We just had to tell him to be really soft.

239
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,823
- [Jared] Well, we had to
tell them both to be soft--

240
00:08:35,823 --> 00:08:36,656
- [Ellie] I know.

241
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:37,785
- But that's just what boys do.

242
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:39,887
- This age is hard with kids,

243
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:41,203
because they're playing,

244
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:44,757
but, most of the time, they're fighting.

245
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:46,134
- Everything everybody's
playing with looks

246
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,556
more exciting than what
they're playing with, so--

247
00:08:48,556 --> 00:08:50,383
- [Ellie] They want
what everyone else has.

248
00:08:50,383 --> 00:08:52,101
- You look like you're
having more fun than I am.

249
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:52,934
I want that.

250
00:08:52,934 --> 00:08:53,767
- [Ellie] Give me!

251
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:54,600
- [Joel] I really like
that hat you're wearing.

252
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,701
(laughs)

253
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,736
No, I want it back.

254
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,569
- No, that's mine.

255
00:08:57,569 --> 00:08:58,402
- No, I want both hats. I want both hats.

256
00:08:58,402 --> 00:09:00,147
- You can't have both
hats. You have one head.

257
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:02,230
(laughs)

258
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:06,415
- [Ellie] I can hear
you, but I can't see you.

259
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:09,080
- Can we take a bow after
that weird performance?

260
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,487
That was a--

261
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:12,441
- Performance?

262
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:13,893
- [Ellie] He's like, "That was real".

263
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:16,779
- Those were real emotions?
- I really like your hat.

264
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:18,654
- I want your Ogden, your Ogden hat.

265
00:09:18,654 --> 00:09:20,375
Go ahead.
- I told you I'd buy you one.

266
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,208
- [Jared] It's cool.

267
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,041
- I told you I'd buy you one.

268
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,417
- [Ellie] Are you guys gonna say goodbye?

269
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:27,417
Cal, can you say goodbye to Lincoln?

270
00:09:28,471 --> 00:09:30,175
- Bye, Calvin.

271
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,476
There's the T-rex.

272
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:32,772
- [Ellie] He's long gone.

273
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:33,969
Oh!

274
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:35,783
Did Jackson just push him?

275
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,616
I missed it.

276
00:09:36,616 --> 00:09:38,317
- No, they ran into each other.

277
00:09:38,317 --> 00:09:39,187
- [Ellie] K, well, that's the goodbye.

278
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,180
Let's go.

279
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,013
- Let's go.

280
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,304
- [Ellie] Happy birthday to Bonnie.

281
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:44,451
Say goodbye.

282
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,782
Say goodbye, Cal, to Link.

283
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:47,779
- [Jared] Hey, hey.

284
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:48,779
- Thank you.

285
00:09:50,102 --> 00:09:51,128
(laughs)

286
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,045
Owie, owie.

287
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:55,407
I made them give each other a hug,

288
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:57,815
because sometimes they fight.

289
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:58,648
Bye.

290
00:09:58,648 --> 00:09:59,481
- [Joel] Be good, boys.

291
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:00,314
(laughs)

292
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:01,234
- I need to hear you say it.

293
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,548
I need to hear you say it one more time.

294
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:04,776
- I think I've said this.

295
00:10:04,776 --> 00:10:06,812
Do you see why I hate crafts?

296
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:08,279
Do you see me craft?

297
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,832
In the four years we have
filmed, do you see me craft much?

298
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:12,665
- [Jared] No.

299
00:10:12,665 --> 00:10:13,498
- No.

300
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,331
- [Jared] Which is so strange.

301
00:10:14,331 --> 00:10:15,164
- Because I hate it.

302
00:10:15,164 --> 00:10:15,997
- We have a craft room.

303
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,263
- [Ellie] No, we don't.

304
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,635
- That's pretty much what it's called.

305
00:10:18,635 --> 00:10:20,018
- I liked what you said
that once to your mom.

306
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,125
She's like, "What".

307
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,297
- [Jared] You have a craft room?

308
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:24,755
- She even knew Ellie don't
know how to craft, girl.

309
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:27,712
- [Jared] Ellie is being
stinkin' cute, because she has

310
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:30,003
this project for church
that she's working on.

311
00:10:30,003 --> 00:10:31,002
- Ellie don't love it.

312
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:32,684
- [Jared] And she's making these blocks.

313
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:33,517
- I do love it.

314
00:10:33,517 --> 00:10:36,862
The thing is, okay, the
thing is is I can totally see

315
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:40,376
how people really like this
and how it's fun for them.

316
00:10:40,376 --> 00:10:44,104
I feel like I just get too
flustered in the little things,

317
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:47,014
which I shouldn't, and I
could make it more fun.

318
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,737
Like, now that I'm getting
into it, I'm enjoying it,

319
00:10:49,737 --> 00:10:51,356
and it's like, "This is fun and crafty"--

320
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:52,189
- [Jared] Good.

321
00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:53,634
- But I feel like, in the
moment, I get overwhelmed.

322
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:55,276
It's like measurements?

323
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:58,065
Like, I just. (grunts)

324
00:10:58,065 --> 00:10:59,867
Some things I like better than others.

325
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,429
- [Jared] Yeah, and that's okay.

326
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,035
Ellie, you are allowed to have

327
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:04,768
your own hobbies and interests.

328
00:11:04,768 --> 00:11:05,702
Do you know that?
- Totes.

329
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:07,912
Yeah, I would totally like
rather like clean my toenails

330
00:11:07,912 --> 00:11:09,225
and give myself a pedicure.

331
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,172
- [Jared] Right.

332
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:11,469
- Like, your mom is good at it.

333
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,492
She just thinks of things,
and she just does it.

334
00:11:13,492 --> 00:11:16,439
- [Jared] Yeah, my mom, it's
pretty amazing what she can do.

335
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,691
- But it's probably because
she's been doing it for years.

336
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,771
- [Jared] Probably longer
than you've even been alive.

337
00:11:20,771 --> 00:11:23,616
- Probably, but I used
to love making jewelry.

338
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:27,880
Bonnie and Julie, Bonnie
and I, we would get beads,

339
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,726
beautiful like Schwarzkopf beads

340
00:11:30,726 --> 00:11:34,627
and real sterling silver
wire, and we would make beads,

341
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:36,774
like nice jewelry, and it was so fun,

342
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:38,423
but it's 'cause I just knew how to do it,

343
00:11:38,423 --> 00:11:40,496
and, when you know how to
do something, you have fun.

344
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,907
If I got into crafts more
and I knew what I was doing

345
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:45,923
half the time, it would
probably be more fun.

346
00:11:45,923 --> 00:11:47,486
- What you're trying to tell me is that

347
00:11:47,486 --> 00:11:51,718
something that's new is hard
and, therefore, not fun?

348
00:11:51,718 --> 00:11:52,551
- Totally.

349
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:53,947
- [Jared] So, like life.

350
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,959
- When Jared's old
friend that's my friend,

351
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:58,792
Jared's little girlfriend

352
00:11:58,792 --> 00:11:59,868
that turned into my really good friend--

353
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:01,849
- [Jared] We talked about
this on our relationship Q&A.

354
00:12:01,849 --> 00:12:04,050
- She's actually moving to
Utah, and we text a lot,

355
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,941
and I'm like, "When are you moving,"

356
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:07,950
'cause she's really fun
and artsy, and I'm like,

357
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,555
me and her getting together,
we'll have so much fun.

358
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:11,942
- [Jared] Doing crafts.

359
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:14,067
- Yeah, 'cause she'll teach me.

360
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,833
As I was putting Calvin to bed, I said,

361
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:17,889
"I can't lay with you".

362
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:18,941
I kinda get sick at night,

363
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,276
like it really hits me
really bad at night,

364
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:24,109
and I had to get this project done

365
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:27,737
for activity days, and I laid Calvin down

366
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:30,642
and I laid with him, and I
said, "I need you to stay".

367
00:12:30,642 --> 00:12:32,631
Whatever; of course he's not going to,

368
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,919
and he stayed at his door
and just kinda whined

369
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,565
at his door, and then
I was like, "Come here.

370
00:12:37,565 --> 00:12:40,643
"Lay on the couch. Lay down while I work,"

371
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,865
and he just was so good
to just lay on the couch,

372
00:12:43,865 --> 00:12:46,467
and I just kept saying, "Close
your eyes, close your eyes,"

373
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:49,300
and he fell asleep, cute baby boy,

374
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,590
but I finished the project,

375
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,111
and I have to say, as much as
I was like, "I hate crafts,"

376
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:56,071
I really enjoyed it.

377
00:12:56,071 --> 00:12:56,904
I did.

378
00:12:56,904 --> 00:13:00,213
It was nice sitting next to
the fire, eating some chips,

379
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:03,002
cutting paper, like gluing.

380
00:13:03,002 --> 00:13:04,663
It was just fun.

381
00:13:04,663 --> 00:13:06,674
As much as I say I didn't like it,

382
00:13:06,674 --> 00:13:08,897
it actually turned out to be really nice,

383
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,631
and I think it turned out stinkin' cute.

384
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:12,973
There are the blocks.

385
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:14,806
Look how cute that is.

386
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:18,418
I think the girls are really
gonna love doing this.

387
00:13:18,418 --> 00:13:19,251
I had fun.

388
00:13:19,251 --> 00:13:23,739
It took me a heck of a lot
longer to do than I thought,

389
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:27,107
but it'll go faster, I
think, with the girls,

390
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,797
'cause I kinda know what I'm doing now.

391
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:32,469
That is what I've been up to tonight.

392
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,901
Thank you guys so much for
all of your well wishes.

393
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,677
Thank you guys so much for your stories.

394
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:39,286
Jared and I are so excited.

395
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:42,056
I still think it's
hilarious what Jackson said.

396
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,328
We need a Hulk baby.

397
00:13:43,328 --> 00:13:45,453
We need a really strong baby like him.

398
00:13:45,453 --> 00:13:47,860
I'm gonna go ahead and
transfer this kiddo,

399
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,297
clean up my mess, and
then I am going to bed.

400
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,229
See you guys tomorrow. Bye.

401
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,812
(gentle music)

402
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,972
Are we both putting our kids to bed?

403
00:14:01,972 --> 00:14:03,528
- I'm wrestling mine to get her to go.

404
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:06,290
- [Ellie] Hey, mine went to
bed much better than this.

405
00:14:06,290 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughs)
