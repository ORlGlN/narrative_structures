1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:02,220
- Um, Ellie, I think we've got

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,947
a little bit of a problem outside.

3
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,109
- What's going on?

4
00:00:05,109 --> 00:00:06,151
- Um, will you come with me and we'll

5
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:07,107
take a look together?

6
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:08,607
- [Ellie] Is the--

7
00:00:10,645 --> 00:00:12,687
- Grass outside, there's
something completely

8
00:00:12,687 --> 00:00:13,924
different than grass.

9
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:14,757
- [Ellie] Shoot.

10
00:00:14,757 --> 00:00:17,210
- Thumbs up, more like thumbs down.

11
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,026
- [Ellie] You're making me worried.

12
00:00:19,026 --> 00:00:20,194
- Come look.

13
00:00:20,194 --> 00:00:22,777
(upbeat music)

14
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:29,450
- What the heck?

15
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:32,561
We can't back out with that.

16
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:36,320
- [Jared] There's a giant
pile of dirt in our driveway.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,153
- [Ellie] The top soil.

18
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:38,974
- [Jared] I think it's
the rest of the topsoil.

19
00:00:38,974 --> 00:00:40,568
But we can't get the trailer out with

20
00:00:40,568 --> 00:00:43,561
the van, well I might be
able to curve it out there.

21
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:45,123
- Oh, I wish they would
have put it on that side.

22
00:00:45,123 --> 00:00:46,798
- [Jared] I know! (laughs)

23
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:47,631
Crap.

24
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:48,724
- [Ellie] Oh well.

25
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:50,300
- [Jared] We'll maneuver round it.

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,145
- [Ellie] Wahoo!

27
00:00:51,145 --> 00:00:53,003
- [Jared] Kind of a little
bit of an issue, though, huh?

28
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:54,214
- Um, you can still make it work.

29
00:00:54,214 --> 00:00:55,831
- [Jared] I think I can pull, oh my--

30
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,445
- [Ellie] You can back this
car out and back the van.

31
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:58,657
- [Jared] Well yeah, we'll move moms car

32
00:00:58,657 --> 00:01:02,306
but then getting around
there, that's gonna be ...

33
00:01:02,306 --> 00:01:06,619
I'm not that good at
driving with the trailer.

34
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:08,967
- [Ellie] What do you
think of all these trees?

35
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,076
- [Jackson] I guess I like them.

36
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:10,909
- [Ellie] You like 'em?

37
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:13,094
We are looking at trees
right now for our yard.

38
00:01:13,094 --> 00:01:16,331
We are looking at River Birch
trees for our back yard,

39
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:20,294
we are looking at a
shade master honey locus,

40
00:01:20,294 --> 00:01:22,877
and snow crab, and an ash tree.

41
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,816
- [Jared] Do you want crabs in our trees?

42
00:01:26,816 --> 00:01:28,374
- No, yeah.

43
00:01:28,374 --> 00:01:29,596
- [Ellie] Oh, they'll pinch a little.

44
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:30,429
- They might pinch a little,

45
00:01:30,429 --> 00:01:31,918
but they'll taste pretty good, too.

46
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:33,342
- [Ellie] You just won't
climb on it too high,

47
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,934
thanks to mom, it's all her knowledge,

48
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:36,152
I don't know any of it.

49
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:38,559
I was like, now what
tree is by the swing set?

50
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:39,972
That is the shade master,

51
00:01:39,972 --> 00:01:42,589
so definitely need a shade master.

52
00:01:42,589 --> 00:01:43,812
So this is fun, guys,

53
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,164
we have everything written down,

54
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:48,676
we have all the trees we wanna get,

55
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:49,711
we're almost there!

56
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,061
- Gotta get the grass in, and
then we can start planting.

57
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:55,190
- What are your favorite trees?

58
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:57,292
Where do you live, what kind of trees?

59
00:01:57,292 --> 00:02:00,311
Give us some suggestions of
what kind of trees to plant.

60
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:01,233
- Tell me what you think about this,

61
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:03,673
if we had just like tons of property,

62
00:02:03,673 --> 00:02:06,388
I'd want a couple of weeping
willows, just to have here.

63
00:02:06,388 --> 00:02:07,846
- Oh, that would be so pretty.

64
00:02:07,846 --> 00:02:09,972
Mom is heading out, guys.

65
00:02:09,972 --> 00:02:13,691
And Jared's gonna bring out the drink,

66
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:17,858
and can you Jackson, these
were our camping treats.

67
00:02:21,265 --> 00:02:22,390
- Oh, that will get me home.

68
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:24,340
- Can you put a cookie
in there for grandma

69
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,923
for on her way out?

70
00:02:27,086 --> 00:02:30,191
Just two, she doesn't need more than two.

71
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,043
- [Grandma] Just two.

72
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,615
- [Ellie] Yeah, that's perfect,

73
00:02:32,615 --> 00:02:34,698
and then let's put some--

74
00:02:37,669 --> 00:02:39,144
- [Jared] These are the choices.

75
00:02:39,144 --> 00:02:41,709
- [Ellie] Put two of these
in the bag for her, too.

76
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:43,358
Perfect.

77
00:02:43,358 --> 00:02:45,135
That way she has a little treat.

78
00:02:45,135 --> 00:02:49,042
She doesn't like diet,
we don't wanna do that.

79
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:52,094
She'll like Dr. Pepper. (laughs)

80
00:02:52,094 --> 00:02:54,730
- [Ellie] Oh, Coke, perfect.

81
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:56,198
Well thanks, mom.

82
00:02:56,198 --> 00:02:58,325
- [Grandma] Good luck, honey.

83
00:02:58,325 --> 00:03:00,077
- I want three because I'm three.

84
00:03:00,077 --> 00:03:01,296
- [Ellie] You want three
cause you're three?

85
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:02,129
- Yeah.

86
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:02,962
- [Ellie] Okay, I want you to be really

87
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:04,139
happy with what you get.

88
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,222
- Okay, team!

89
00:03:06,822 --> 00:03:08,737
You ready to do this?

90
00:03:08,737 --> 00:03:09,702
You ready?

91
00:03:09,702 --> 00:03:10,727
Let's rock and roll.

92
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:13,318
- I will guide you out, do
not hit the pile of dirt.

93
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,008
Half of it's gone now, so we're good.

94
00:03:15,008 --> 00:03:17,662
- [Jared] Okay, you be
my co-pilot, as always,

95
00:03:17,662 --> 00:03:21,437
you're the best co-pilot in
the world, 'kay, here you go.

96
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:23,604
- [Ellie] And you made it!

97
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,281
Good job, he never gives
himself enough credit.

98
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:29,743
He's pretty good at this.

99
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:32,464
Well first, I cannot even
believe we missed it.

100
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:34,797
On June 1st, tell 'em, Baby.

101
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:39,517
- We hit three years of daily vlogging.

102
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,190
Without missing a day, even.

103
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,826
Like how incredible is that?

104
00:03:42,826 --> 00:03:45,326
- Three years of daily videos.

105
00:03:46,647 --> 00:03:48,918
- The crazy thing is that
we started all of it,

106
00:03:48,918 --> 00:03:50,645
we're like let's just try it for a week,

107
00:03:50,645 --> 00:03:52,472
is that what we said,
two weeks, or a month?

108
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:54,079
I can't remember, one of those.

109
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,912
- [Ellie] It was like a week, or two,

110
00:03:54,912 --> 00:03:56,159
and it turned into everything.

111
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,668
- Three years, that's crazy.

112
00:03:58,668 --> 00:04:00,760
- This has been not only so
fun for just Jared and I,

113
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,550
but everyone that we've been able to meet

114
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,386
and interact with.

115
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:05,080
Whether it has been family that has

116
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,250
participated, and supported us,

117
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,200
whether it's been meeting
you guys at meet ups,

118
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,196
whether it's been really
cool opportunities

119
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:15,568
to go places or meet people,
this has been really fun.

120
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:18,099
It also has been very challenging,

121
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:20,286
I feel like Jared and I are in a thick

122
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,711
part of life right now,
we have so much fun,

123
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:27,702
and obviously we try and
share the very fun moments,

124
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,277
but we have two young kids,

125
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:31,657
we are trying to raise them, we are tired,

126
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:34,875
we are just, I mean, you know,

127
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,035
we have young kids that
we're trying to raise

128
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:40,214
and that alone is a hard
part of life right now,

129
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:43,421
but it also is very fun and exciting and--

130
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:45,659
- And rewarding, you know,

131
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:49,826
there's just, there's so many
amazing wonderful things,

132
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:53,219
it's just fun to be able to look back

133
00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:55,365
on every single one of
them and everything.

134
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:58,733
- It's really cool that we're
able to do this on top of it,

135
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:01,855
like we're able to share a
little part of our lives.

136
00:05:01,855 --> 00:05:06,405
We are heading, camping,
quote, this is not--

137
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:07,372
- [Jared] What do they call it?

138
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,363
- This is more of a hotel stay,

139
00:05:09,363 --> 00:05:11,080
but you bring your own hotel.

140
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,933
They have like a cool facility
here that we're going.

141
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:16,186
And Jared and I when we were coming,

142
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:18,332
we were like, we both had head aches,

143
00:05:18,332 --> 00:05:20,301
it was crazy, the kids, you know,

144
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:23,051
loading kids up, packing for kids,

145
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:26,477
loading food up, you know, driving,

146
00:05:26,477 --> 00:05:28,470
and just going anywhere with toddlers

147
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,972
is sometimes overwhelming,
but the memories,

148
00:05:30,972 --> 00:05:32,930
and all the work that it takes is so fun,

149
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:35,709
and I'm so grateful that
Jared's parents and my parents

150
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:39,527
did a lot of this kind of
stuff when we were young.

151
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:41,143
- I think what they call
what we're doing is,

152
00:05:41,143 --> 00:05:42,537
is it glamping?

153
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:43,405
- [Ellie] Totes.

154
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,803
- Glamor camping, glamping, I don't know.

155
00:05:46,803 --> 00:05:48,558
- It will be fun, though, we're excited.

156
00:05:48,558 --> 00:05:51,167
- Look, guys, we made it to the RV park.

157
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:53,658
Everyone's ahead of me, and
they're swimming, let's go.

158
00:05:53,658 --> 00:05:55,359
(splash)

159
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,064
(upbeat piano music)

160
00:05:58,064 --> 00:05:59,777
- That is cold!

161
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:00,637
- [Jared] Is it cold?

162
00:06:00,637 --> 00:06:01,531
- Yeah!

163
00:06:01,531 --> 00:06:03,097
- Let me try!

164
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,087
Ah!

165
00:06:04,087 --> 00:06:06,670
(upbeat music)

166
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,707
(Jared laughing)

167
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,395
- We just got back from the pool,

168
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:29,945
we are all set up,
disaster-free, kids are happy.

169
00:06:29,945 --> 00:06:32,702
- Ellie, the night is still young.

170
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:34,828
- The kids and I just sat on the grass,

171
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:36,804
we ate chips and salsa here.

172
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:38,532
It just felt really good
to sit on the grass.

173
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,843
Jared's chasing them.

174
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,656
This facility is really cool,

175
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:43,581
they have a pool here,
they have a play area,

176
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:47,128
we brought our bikes, we're
gonna go on a big bike ride.

177
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:48,880
You can kinda see how everyone is set up.

178
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,616
They each have their little areas.

179
00:06:50,616 --> 00:06:54,435
I have to show you guys
something really quick, though.

180
00:06:54,435 --> 00:06:57,509
Cause I ordered this
for the camping trailer,

181
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:01,080
and when it came I laughed so hard.

182
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,784
I laughed so hard.

183
00:07:02,784 --> 00:07:04,782
Because on Amazon it looked a lot bigger.

184
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:08,226
It's a salt and pepper shaker,
it's really, really small.

185
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,410
Look at that, isn't that the cutest,

186
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,624
tiniest, little salt and pepper shaker?

187
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:14,270
It's so tiny and cute.

188
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,353
It's so tiny.

189
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,271
So little!

190
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:20,829
We also got a little Polaroid
to keep in the camper,

191
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:23,130
that way we can take
pictures and always have like

192
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,047
a little camper Polaroid
of how our trips went.

193
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:30,729
And so the first picture
was of course Calvin

194
00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:32,514
when he had thrown up and he was sad.

195
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:33,856
Tonight I'm gonna take a picture

196
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,416
of the boys sitting on their bed.

197
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:38,184
So we'll have our camping
trip, round 2 right there.

198
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,895
So I just think that
this will be really cute

199
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:42,176
in the years to come to look back on.

200
00:07:42,176 --> 00:07:44,043
- A Katy trailer.

201
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:46,327
- [Ellie] Katy's is called April.

202
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:47,660
April's trailer.

203
00:07:49,695 --> 00:07:50,775
- April Katy's.

204
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:54,831
- April, Katy's, okay, I
think he thinks Davey is Katy.

205
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:56,112
We came with April and Davey,

206
00:07:56,112 --> 00:07:57,328
so we're gonna say hi to them,

207
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:59,377
get the kids to bed, have fun.

208
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:02,960
(Jared makes engine noise)

209
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:07,871
- [Jared] Calvin is ready to rock!

210
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:11,177
Look at him, he's like in
position and everything.

211
00:08:11,177 --> 00:08:12,594
You like it, Cal?

212
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:14,735
(laughs)

213
00:08:14,735 --> 00:08:17,264
You're gonna go for it, you're
actually gonna drive it?

214
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:21,264
Kay, guys, stay there,
oh wait, let's watch mom.

215
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:24,676
- [Davey] It'll take a sec, yeah.

216
00:08:24,676 --> 00:08:27,067
- [Jared] Yeah, that's my wife!

217
00:08:27,067 --> 00:08:30,801
- [Davey] Yeah, she's
got the need for speed.

218
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,443
- [Ellie] Ah, it's hard to turn!

219
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:35,935
- [Jared] (laughs) You're
doing awesome, Ellie, good job!

220
00:08:35,936 --> 00:08:37,302
- This is what you do to go forward.

221
00:08:37,302 --> 00:08:39,340
Put your hand on it.

222
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,327
And go a little bit, not a lot.

223
00:08:41,327 --> 00:08:43,831
- [Jackson] No, I don't wanna try it.

224
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:45,947
- Oh yes you do, put your
foot on and you'll go.

225
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,574
- [Jared] Good job!

226
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:49,517
- See, there you go!

227
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:51,101
Woo!

228
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,703
Push it back, push this one back.

229
00:08:52,703 --> 00:08:54,000
- [Jared] Just soft, soft, soft, soft.

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,600
- Good job, slow, slow,
slow, good job, keep going.

231
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,433
Woo!

232
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,672
- [Jared] Good job!

233
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:01,948
- Just a little slow.

234
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:04,423
- [Jared] Just a little,
Jackson, just a little

235
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:06,618
- [Jackson] No, no, no!

236
00:09:06,618 --> 00:09:08,326
- [Jared] Let go, let go.

237
00:09:08,326 --> 00:09:10,960
Yeah, you guys are killing it!

238
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,857
- [Ellie] Good job, okay, that's good!

239
00:09:12,857 --> 00:09:14,682
- Ellie has her hand on the break,

240
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:17,305
so when he goes a little
faster, she's breaking too.

241
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:19,641
So, that's so good!

242
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,871
Jackson, you did it!

243
00:09:21,871 --> 00:09:22,704
- What did you say?

244
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:23,899
(Jackson mumbles)

245
00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:24,826
- Say it one more time.

246
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:25,741
- It was awesome.

247
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:26,723
- Good.

248
00:09:26,723 --> 00:09:27,605
You wanna get on, Cal?

249
00:09:27,605 --> 00:09:29,116
Sit right here.

250
00:09:29,116 --> 00:09:30,686
- [Jared] Kay, Calvin's turn, oh my gosh,

251
00:09:30,686 --> 00:09:31,640
he just turned it on,

252
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,138
he's like I know where
the power switch is.

253
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,411
(Jared makes engine noises)

254
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,661
(laughing)

255
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:43,615
- [Ellie] There ya go!

256
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,072
- [Jared] Good job, Calvin,
dude, he's already doing tricks,

257
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:47,818
sitting up high and everything,

258
00:09:47,818 --> 00:09:50,937
next thing you know
he's gonna go handless.

259
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:53,839
- I feel like we need a
tour of April and Davey's--

260
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,629
- [Jared] I know, look at their trailer!

261
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:59,044
Boom-chic-a-bow-wow!

262
00:09:59,044 --> 00:10:02,077
- [Ellie] Jared's hips
won't let him very well.

263
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:05,750
This is for 14 and older,
is that what it says?

264
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,026
- [Kid] 14 and under.

265
00:10:07,026 --> 00:10:09,688
- [Davey] 14 and older.

266
00:10:09,688 --> 00:10:10,855
- [Ellie] Woo!

267
00:10:12,673 --> 00:10:14,806
- [Jared] My hips won't
let me do anything else.

268
00:10:14,806 --> 00:10:17,365
- [Ellie] The kids are loving this bike.

269
00:10:17,365 --> 00:10:18,918
Jackson, I'm proud of you for going,

270
00:10:18,918 --> 00:10:20,375
I'm glad I encouraged you.

271
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,192
Sometimes you just gotta do it.

272
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,592
I knew you wanted to, but
you were a little nervous.

273
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:27,678
- When I grow up bigger
I can ride it by myself.

274
00:10:27,678 --> 00:10:29,493
- [Ellie] Yes, you can.

275
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:33,216
We'll have to get you one,
you and Calvin to race.

276
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,890
- Yeah, Calvin's a tiny
one, a tiny motorcycle toy.

277
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,050
- [Ellie] And you want a big one?

278
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,800
- Yeah, I want a riding-self one.

279
00:10:42,728 --> 00:10:43,757
- [Ellie] Cool!

280
00:10:43,757 --> 00:10:45,924
- And a big one like that.

281
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,967
- [Ellie] Kay, well
maybe here in a few years

282
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:50,817
when you're a little
bigger we could get one.

283
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,653
- Yeah, like this big!

284
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,437
- [Ellie] Yeah.

285
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:56,542
Remember the three cookies
Jackson had earlier?

286
00:10:56,542 --> 00:11:00,709
He saved them and he just
gave them all to his friends.

287
00:11:02,218 --> 00:11:03,988
We're so glad we're here!

288
00:11:03,988 --> 00:11:04,902
- I know, this is so fun!

289
00:11:04,902 --> 00:11:06,819
- [Ellie] Party, party!

290
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,396
- And AC's going, so we're happy.

291
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:10,962
- [Ellie] Yeah, it feels good.

292
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:13,795
The moon is huge, kids are asleep,

293
00:11:15,646 --> 00:11:18,854
Jared and I are eating Choco-Tacos,

294
00:11:18,854 --> 00:11:19,955
- Aren't Choco-Tacos the best?

295
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:21,166
April and Dave are gonna come over,

296
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:21,999
we're gonna play a game,

297
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:24,416
but I asked Jared to download

298
00:11:26,176 --> 00:11:27,994
another book for me to listen to.

299
00:11:27,994 --> 00:11:31,095
I really want to listen to, do
you remember the name of him?

300
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:32,428
- Tony Robins.

301
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:34,623
- That's who I wanna listen to next.

302
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,873
I just finished the book,
the Marie Kondo book

303
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:39,663
about life and organizing and tidying up,

304
00:11:39,663 --> 00:11:41,709
I really, really enjoyed it.

305
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:44,068
And I purged quite a bit of stuff,

306
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,791
and I felt really good,
why are you laughing?

307
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,112
- All my socks, before I got new ones.

308
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:51,307
- Kay, I didn't mean to do all of them,

309
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:54,802
we had a conversation, I'm not
gonna get into it (laughs).

310
00:11:54,802 --> 00:11:57,350
Anyway, but Jared's
downloading that for me

311
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,342
because he's gonna try
and upload some footage,

312
00:11:59,342 --> 00:12:01,582
it's, of course, Internet's
not good here, so.

313
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:03,988
- Of course they advertise Wifi,

314
00:12:03,988 --> 00:12:05,562
of course it's terribly slow.

315
00:12:05,562 --> 00:12:06,395
It's like Hotel's.

316
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:07,479
- [Ellie] But it's better
than the mountains.

317
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:08,312
- Oh yeah.

318
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:09,145
- [Ellie] So this is a good in-between

319
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,017
for vloggers for camping. (laughs)

320
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:12,694
- Doesn't it look so fun?

321
00:12:12,694 --> 00:12:14,646
That looks so fun.

322
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:16,978
- [Ellie] The kids, I love them.

323
00:12:16,978 --> 00:12:18,462
- Glamping, is that what it's called?

324
00:12:18,462 --> 00:12:19,460
We're glamping.

325
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,357
- [Ellie] I love it.

326
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:23,005
- I'm having fun, we just got here.

327
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:25,725
You know, this is just the beginning.

328
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:27,306
This is probably the most
excited I've ever been

329
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:29,776
to use the bathroom
before in my entire life.

330
00:12:29,776 --> 00:12:31,338
I'm about to use the potty for the first

331
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:34,542
time in this trailer, and we
got the water all hooked up.

332
00:12:34,542 --> 00:12:37,439
And guys, I'm gonna be the first

333
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:40,668
person to use the toilet in our trailer.

334
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:43,281
I don't know why it's
exciting, it just is, 'kay?

335
00:12:43,281 --> 00:12:44,938
Don't judge me, seriously.

336
00:12:44,938 --> 00:12:48,241
This is a big moment for
me and my trailer, okay?

337
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:49,879
Stop looking at me like that, guys.

338
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,658
Okay, get out of here, I
have to go to the bathroom.

339
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,819
- [Ellie] Congrats on using
the toilet for the first time.

340
00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:54,652
- [Jared] Thank you very much.

341
00:12:54,652 --> 00:12:55,587
- [Ellie] Congrats, Davey, for using

342
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:57,481
our bowl for the first time.

343
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:01,648
Congrats for us playing
Tensies for the first time,

344
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:03,874
ready, set, go.

345
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:04,707
So, ones.

346
00:13:08,156 --> 00:13:10,473
Ones, oh, that was a
one but it made a six.

347
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,306
One.

348
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:18,030

353
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:26,440
- [Davey] Are you kidding me?

354
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,273
- [Ellie] Yes, this was
a one but it flipped

355
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,743
when I was doing stuff, look, all of them!

356
00:13:28,743 --> 00:13:29,915

357
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:32,486

were rolling. (laughs)

Everyone is in bed asleep,

361
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:40,243
and I am up late working on the video.

362
00:13:40,243 --> 00:13:42,370
It is time to call it a night,

363
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,297
we've had a blast today,

364
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:46,848
and tomorrow is going to be even better.

365
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:49,900
This is so much fun, I love this.

366
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,344
Doing this with my family and friends.

367
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,950
Like this is the coolest thing ever.

368
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,139
Thank you guys so much

370
00:13:58,992 --> 00:14:00,950
