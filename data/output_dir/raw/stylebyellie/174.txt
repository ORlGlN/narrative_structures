1
00:00:00,144 --> 00:00:03,227
(spooky organ music)

2
00:00:20,196 --> 00:00:21,789
- [Ellie] Well good morning.

3
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,591
- [Calvin] Look at the boat.

4
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:25,841
- We are about to hit land.

5
00:00:28,022 --> 00:00:28,855
- The boat.

6
00:00:28,855 --> 00:00:31,789
- [Ellie] You see the boat?

7
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:33,722
That is so cool.

8
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:34,889
- [Jared] Good morning Jackson.

9
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:35,753
- Good morning.

10
00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:36,951
- [Jared] Did you sleep good?

11
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,784
- Yeah.

12
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:38,617
- [Jared] Good.

13
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:39,955
Come outside.

14
00:00:39,955 --> 00:00:41,455
Come look outside.

15
00:00:45,947 --> 00:00:46,851
What do you see?

16
00:00:46,851 --> 00:00:47,934
Say, land ho!

17
00:00:49,568 --> 00:00:50,672
- We're here.

18
00:00:50,672 --> 00:00:51,505
- [Jared] We're here.

19
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:53,462
We're at our first port.

20
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:54,879
We are in Mexico.

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,960
This is amazing.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,864
It's gorgeous, it's beautiful Ellie.

23
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:02,032
- Ready to play in the water?

24
00:01:02,032 --> 00:01:03,453
- [Jared] Yes.

25
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:07,036
(Latin-style guitar music)

26
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:20,034
So what are you thinking right now?

27
00:01:20,034 --> 00:01:22,474
- I'm thinking realistically
I would love it,

28
00:01:22,474 --> 00:01:23,791
the kids might hate this (laughs).

29
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:25,187
- Yeah.

30
00:01:25,187 --> 00:01:27,770
(rain falling)

31
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:35,585
My thinking with all of this is,

32
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,143
let's just embrace it.

33
00:01:37,143 --> 00:01:40,299
This is not gonna be like
this the entire time,

34
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:42,163
so let's just embrace
it, have fun, have fun,

35
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:44,204
in the rain, you know what I mean?

36
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:45,530
Like just have fun in the rain.

37
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,000
- [Ellie] Tots, Jackson, are
you gonna have fun in the rain?

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,621
- We're gonna play in the water anyway.

39
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:49,749
- Are you gonna have fun in the rain?

40
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:50,937
- [Jared] Are you gonna
have fun in the rain?

41
00:01:50,937 --> 00:01:52,134
- No.

42
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:53,198
(Jared laughing)

43
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:55,444
I want to go swimming in the water.

44
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:56,894
- [Jared] You want to go
swimming in the water?

45
00:01:56,894 --> 00:01:57,727
- Yeah.

46
00:01:57,727 --> 00:01:58,877
- [Jared] How about swimming in the water,

47
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,178
in the rain?

48
00:02:00,178 --> 00:02:01,192
- No.

49
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:04,359
(tropical beat music)

50
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,760
- Today we are on the beautiful beach

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,714
of Cozumel, Mexico.

52
00:02:13,714 --> 00:02:14,710
- Look at this one I found.

53
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,877
- [Jared] Wow.

54
00:02:23,553 --> 00:02:24,470
Here we go.

55
00:02:30,397 --> 00:02:31,230
- Yeah!

56
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:35,153
(underwater bubbles)

57
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:48,469
- Is the water warm?

58
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:49,447
- [Jared] Oh it's bathwater warm.

59
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,530
- Oh let's go look at it.

60
00:02:52,384 --> 00:02:55,467
(underwater bubbles)

61
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,311
- Here I go!

62
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,503
- Woo!

63
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,087
(laughing)

64
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:10,648
(growling)

65
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,114
(water splashing)

66
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:23,826
Wee!

67
00:03:26,313 --> 00:03:29,480
(underwater bubbling)

68
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,069
You having fun?

69
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:40,931
Mmm-mmm (laughs).

70
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:41,764
Good job.

71
00:03:48,544 --> 00:03:50,011
- [Ellie] It's salt, huh?

72
00:03:50,011 --> 00:03:51,594
It taste like salt.

73
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,022
- Yeah.

74
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:55,741
- Cozumel, Mexico.

75
00:03:55,741 --> 00:03:56,574
- Bye bye.

76
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,383
- The storm is coming in

77
00:04:01,383 --> 00:04:05,047
and everybody is coming under the area

78
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:07,143
where we're eating.

79
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,939
Jared just went to grab all of our stuff.

80
00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:10,772
(yells)

81
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:14,811
They've been doing so
good to stay close to us.

82
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:16,153
You got all of our stuff.

83
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:16,986
- I got all of our stuff.

84
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:17,819
Did you hear that thunder?

85
00:04:17,819 --> 00:04:18,966
- [Ellie] Yes

86
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:20,620
- That was so big.

87
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,984
- My hood on.

88
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:22,818
- Are you okay?

89
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,718
- [Jared] Oh you want the hood on?

90
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:28,259
This changed from paradise to downpour

91
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,713
in a matter of seconds.

92
00:04:30,713 --> 00:04:31,992
Two thunder strikes.

93
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:33,034
- Everyone just came in to eat,

94
00:04:33,034 --> 00:04:34,586
and we're actually done.

95
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,595
We're gonna try to grab
a taxi and head out.

96
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:37,650
- Head back.

97
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,520
It was so funny.

98
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,734
Everyone was at the pool, and was like,

99
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,771
oh I'm having a good time,
I'm having a good time.

100
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,698
(mock thunder)

101
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,218
You know what, I'm actually
really hungry right now.

102
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,041
We're gonna get out of
the pool and eat lunch.

103
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,593
(laughing)

104
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:49,659
- Okay let's go.

105
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:50,576
- Let's go.

106
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,355
You okay in there Jackson?

107
00:04:54,355 --> 00:04:55,188
- Yeah.

108
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:56,257
- Yeah, you okay?

109
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:58,217
It's actually not raining too bad.

110
00:04:58,217 --> 00:04:59,050
- [Ellie] Hey no one's in the pool.

111
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,565
- Let's go swimming, no one's in the pool.

112
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:01,572
We're only doing it during a

113
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:03,553
(thunder)

114
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,549
a lightning storm.

115
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:06,382
(laughing)

116
00:05:06,382 --> 00:05:08,186
- Where are we going?

117
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:09,999
- Look, we're under cover now.

118
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:11,674
We're under the cover.

119
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:14,841
(tropical beat music)

120
00:05:21,162 --> 00:05:22,829
Smile one two three.

121
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:26,879
We are back at our room

122
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,000
and throughout this trip,

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,503
we've been here for three days,

124
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,616
we've kind of followed a little schedule

125
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,544
and that schedule is wake up,

126
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:35,584
eat breakfast, do an activity.

127
00:05:35,584 --> 00:05:37,923
About lunchtime, have a nap,

128
00:05:37,923 --> 00:05:39,145
then do another activity,

129
00:05:39,145 --> 00:05:42,120
and dinner time, then a
small activity, bed time.

130
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,713
Right now, we are in the middle of the day

131
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:48,705
and the kids are on their nap

132
00:05:48,705 --> 00:05:50,607
right now, how sweet.

133
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:52,500
- They have been so good,

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,705
because they are so tired.

135
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:55,584
- Yes they are.

136
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:57,657
They're both zonked right now.

137
00:05:57,657 --> 00:05:59,002
But when they wake up,

138
00:05:59,002 --> 00:06:00,729
they are in for a surprise.

139
00:06:00,729 --> 00:06:02,537
Ellie you seem like you're dressing up

140
00:06:02,537 --> 00:06:04,498
for something in particular.

141
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:06,365
- I'm gonna get my boots
on and you'll know why.

142
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,532
- [Jared] Ooh.

143
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:18,655
- [Ellie] Good morning.

144
00:06:18,655 --> 00:06:20,642
- [Jared] Good morning.

145
00:06:20,642 --> 00:06:21,642
How are you?

146
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,585
- [Ellie] Do you want to get
dressed, and we can go play?

147
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,097
- Yeah.

148
00:06:27,097 --> 00:06:29,867
(crying)

149
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,700
- This is kinda scary.

150
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,141
Is it kinda scary?

151
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:35,974
- Yeah.

152
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:37,029
- [Ellie] We'll get dressed.

153
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,907
- [Jared] Let's get dressed
up at Buzz Lightyear.

154
00:06:39,907 --> 00:06:40,740
Okay?

155
00:06:47,314 --> 00:06:50,288
Don't you shoot your laser at me.

156
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:53,121
- Who is ready for a Mousequerade?

157
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:55,922
You are!

158
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:59,074
The whole family is all dressed.

159
00:06:59,074 --> 00:07:02,343
Everybody's getting ready to go.

160
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:05,510
(upbeat lively music)

161
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:24,856
- [Jared] Yeah!

162
00:07:26,005 --> 00:07:26,922
You did it!

163
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:48,989
- [Ellie] Woo!

164
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:02,196
- You did it, you did it buddy.

165
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:03,616
Was that fun?

166
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,449
Do you want to do it again?

167
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:05,282
- No.

168
00:08:05,282 --> 00:08:07,532
(laughing)

169
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,779
(clapping)

170
00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:22,979
(cheering)

171
00:08:26,161 --> 00:08:28,994
- And that is a Halloween wrap up.

172
00:08:30,145 --> 00:08:32,177
We have trick or treated.

173
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,400
Calvin, can I see your baggie?

174
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,712
We have trick or treated,
got lots of candy.

175
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,696
We found a wheel that we are playing with.

176
00:08:40,697 --> 00:08:42,592
Jackson, did you enjoy the party?

177
00:08:42,592 --> 00:08:43,424
- Yes.

178
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:44,756
- [Ellie] What was your favorite part?

179
00:08:44,756 --> 00:08:46,227
- I got a treasure for this wheel.

180
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:47,906
- [Ellie] Oh fun.

181
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:50,898
- Yes, I'm showing him all my tricks

182
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:51,981
from piratry.

183
00:08:53,293 --> 00:08:54,639
So here's the deal.

184
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,984
I've tried to make an attempt

185
00:08:55,984 --> 00:08:59,360
to you know, plunder the
ship, take it as my own.

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,537
Call it mine like the Black Pearl.

187
00:09:01,537 --> 00:09:03,625
But then I realized, I
only work with sails.

188
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,148
This is an entirely
different kind of ship.

189
00:09:05,148 --> 00:09:06,551
I wouldn't know what I was doing,

190
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:07,413
plus there's family on board.

191
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,537
I don't want to mess with that,

192
00:09:09,537 --> 00:09:11,518
that's a whole other area
you don't want to mess with.

193
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:12,717
- Not mama bears.

194
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:13,789
- Not mama bears.

195
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:16,094
They're the worse kind of bears.

196
00:09:16,094 --> 00:09:19,511
(romantic Italian music)

197
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:30,421
- Tonight we are having dinner at the Palo

198
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:33,175
which is the fanciest
restaurant on the ship.

199
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:35,046
You have to have a
reservation well in advance,

200
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:36,746
and we were lucky enough to have one.

201
00:09:36,746 --> 00:09:38,183
And we are going to enjoy ourselves.

202
00:09:38,183 --> 00:09:39,227
- And I love it.

203
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,060
It is beautiful.

204
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,050
You can see the ocean right now.

205
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,467
Happy date night.

206
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,327
- [Waitress] And now this
is for you Miss Ellie

207
00:09:50,327 --> 00:09:52,033
and you can decide if you want to share.

208
00:09:52,033 --> 00:09:55,450
- [Ellie] Okay (laughs).

209
00:09:59,548 --> 00:10:00,465
Is it good?

210
00:10:01,484 --> 00:10:02,317
- Yeah.

211
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:03,358
- [Ellie] Alright Jared liked the olive,

212
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:05,423
all of this is like an
appetizer that's been aged,

213
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:07,347
for a very long time,

214
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,680
so I'm gonna try this olive.

215
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:13,826
That was really strong.

216
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:14,659
- That's good.

217
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,559
- [Ellie] Strong flavors, it is good.

218
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,019
- Yeah the sauces make it really nice too.

219
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,228
This dinner is so fun,

220
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:21,772
it's all north Italian based.

221
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,282
We're having intermezzo right now,

222
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:27,699
just in between the meal, a lemon sorbet.

223
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,715
- And it refreshes your
palate and gets you ready for

224
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,402
- Yeah, food in between
the food, it's fun,

225
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:35,808
this is so fun.

226
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,528
- It's like a dessert in between dinner,

227
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:38,912
it's like Ellie's

228
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:40,697
- Ellie's normal schedule.
- Ellie's go to thing.

229
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:41,530
- Yeah.

230
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:55,700
- Is that an animal maded?

231
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,393
- I don't know what do you think it is?

232
00:10:57,393 --> 00:10:58,245
- It's a ghost.

233
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,816
- [Jared] It looks like a ghost.

234
00:10:59,816 --> 00:11:01,304
Or a bat.
- Should I touch it?

235
00:11:01,304 --> 00:11:02,137
- [Jackson] No.

236
00:11:02,137 --> 00:11:04,043
- [Jared] Or a bat.

237
00:11:04,043 --> 00:11:06,579
(yelling)

238
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:07,836
- [Ellie] Want to touch it?

239
00:11:07,836 --> 00:11:09,136
- [Jared] You want to touch it?

240
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,132
- [Ellie] It's head fell off.

241
00:11:11,132 --> 00:11:13,019
- It's just a towel.

242
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:13,979
Isn't that cool?

243
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:16,307
That they can make these
animals out of towels?

244
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:17,140
- Yeah.

245
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,445
- We had lobster, we had

246
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,278
- [Ellie] Mickey Mouse.

247
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,405
- Mickey Mouse and now we had a bat.

248
00:11:20,405 --> 00:11:22,023
Hey, did you have fun today?

249
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:22,898
- Yes.

250
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:25,791
- Hey did you have fun today?

251
00:11:25,791 --> 00:11:26,624
Yeah?

252
00:11:26,624 --> 00:11:28,036
Hey did you have fun today?

253
00:11:28,036 --> 00:11:28,876
- Yes.

254
00:11:28,876 --> 00:11:30,713
- [Jared] You look so cute in that robe.

255
00:11:30,713 --> 00:11:33,017
- Thank you, they should
sell 'em at the gift shop.

256
00:11:33,017 --> 00:11:35,276
- [Jared] Oh my goodness,
they have 'em in our closet.

257
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:36,911
- I know, for free.

258
00:11:36,911 --> 00:11:38,974
So I'm just wearing it.

259
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:40,584
What song is that?

260
00:11:40,584 --> 00:11:44,001
♫ Dee da da da dee da da

261
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,225
- And if you're wondering,

262
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:47,058
I had fun today too.

263
00:11:47,058 --> 00:11:47,891
♫ A B C D E F G

264
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,358
But we are going to bed.

265
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,922
We're gonna have a good night sleep.

266
00:11:50,922 --> 00:11:52,368
♫ H I J K L

267
00:11:52,368 --> 00:11:53,937

00:11:53,937 --> 00:11:56,066
- [Jared] After we say our ABC's.

269
00:11:56,066 --> 00:11:57,211
Can you say goodnight?

270
00:11:57,211 --> 00:11:58,794
- Goodnight ABC's.

271
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:01,010
