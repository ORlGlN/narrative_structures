1
00:00:00,607 --> 00:00:02,192
- (Ellie gasps)

2
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:03,860
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,407
(Calvin screams)

4
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,045
- Tonight is pumpkin carving night.

5
00:00:08,045 --> 00:00:11,272
We are gonna parve, we're
gonna parve pumpkins.

6
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:13,347
We're going to carve pumpkins tonight.

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,422
- You lost some brain cells (mumbles).

8
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,255
- [Jared] I did.

9
00:00:15,255 --> 00:00:17,039
Good morning, it is a bit chilly

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,581
and it's a bit dark in here,
let's hit those lights.

11
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,742
Guess what, I've got a
solution to our chilly problem.

12
00:00:22,742 --> 00:00:24,477
It's this button right
here, ready for this,

13
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:27,012
hey that's my light, don't worry,

14
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:30,179
we've got the warmth right here, boom.

15
00:00:31,716 --> 00:00:34,767
Wait for it, boom, there we go.

16
00:00:34,767 --> 00:00:37,314
It's time to start the fireplace,

17
00:00:37,314 --> 00:00:41,744
that's so crazy to me, it's
mid-October, no way Jose.

18
00:00:41,744 --> 00:00:42,806
- Yes way.

19
00:00:42,806 --> 00:00:44,460
- [Jared] I'm, I'm keeping myself warm,

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,646
keeping my body warm,
aren't you a little chilly?

21
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:50,371
Oh no way, how do you
like your new blasters?

22
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,352
- These are blasters.

23
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,454
- [Jared] Do you like them?

24
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:53,287
- Yeah.

25
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,711
- Yeah, they're fun for about a minute.

26
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,544
It's cause they're loud that's,

27
00:00:56,544 --> 00:00:58,391
that's what I'm trying to say.

28
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,174
- I do not know how many more fall

29
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:02,526
beautiful warm days we are gonna have.

30
00:01:02,526 --> 00:01:07,092
So we are taking advantage
of Chick-fil-A, and the park.

31
00:01:07,092 --> 00:01:08,541
We have Calvin the rock climber.

32
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:12,624
We have Spider-Man, hi,
hey undo my webs, thanks.

33
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:16,893
I kinda love that wherever we go

34
00:01:16,893 --> 00:01:18,187
Jackson wants to wear his costume

35
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:20,557
and I will never tell him no.

36
00:01:20,557 --> 00:01:22,633
He can wear that costume
to church if he wanted.

37
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,953
- [Jackson] (mumbles).

38
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,536
- [Ellie] You are
pumping, all by yourself.

39
00:01:30,115 --> 00:01:31,563
Good job, when we go to grandma's

40
00:01:31,563 --> 00:01:34,313
next can you try it at her house?

41
00:01:35,174 --> 00:01:36,007
- Sure.

42
00:01:36,007 --> 00:01:38,840
- Sure, you're getting it to, huh.

43
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:46,996
- My favorite part of the park

44
00:01:46,996 --> 00:01:50,087
to go on that tire swing and that one.

45
00:01:50,087 --> 00:01:54,329
- Swinging, you know, that's
always my favorite too.

46
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,302
We don't have a swing
set, huh, nope, someday.

47
00:01:58,302 --> 00:01:59,644
- Just teeter-totter.

48
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:02,727
- Just a teeter-totter, you are cute.

49
00:02:05,385 --> 00:02:07,449
Hey, I like my dates with you.

50
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:09,734
Calvin's just running, playing, huh.

51
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:13,711
Can't even see him, call
his name, oh there he is.

52
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,419
He's behind there,
Calvin, do you wanna eat?

53
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:17,347
- [Calvin] No.

54
00:02:17,347 --> 00:02:19,666
(Ellie and Jackson laughing)

55
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,333
- [Ellie] Did you just hear him.

56
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,299
He just said, no, Calvin.

57
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:31,022
- [Calvin] (mumbles), rock.

58
00:02:31,022 --> 00:02:34,363
- [Ellie] You're on a rock,
hey Calvin do you wanna eat?

59
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,196
- No.

60
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,863
- [Ellie] No, why is that funny?

61
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:42,071
Do you know you used to say that too?

62
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:46,734
Yeah, sometimes you still
say no, huh, yeah I do too.

63
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:49,067
- [Jackson] Now I'm a clown.

64
00:02:50,934 --> 00:02:54,101
- [Ellie] Ew, you look disgusting, ew.

65
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,334
- Do you want to be one of these clowns?

66
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,167
- [Calvin] Yeah.

67
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,531
- [Ellie] Do you wanna be it Calvin?

68
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,698
What, okay we went from no
costumes to scary, you like it.

69
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:10,488
- [Jackson] No, no put
in on your eyes in it.

70
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,971
- [Calvin] (mumbles).

71
00:03:16,971 --> 00:03:17,892
- [Ellie] You have a nose?

72
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:18,928
- [Calvin] Yeah.

73
00:03:18,928 --> 00:03:20,973
- [Ellie] 'Kay, do you need to pick it?

74
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:24,556
'Kay pick your nose,
oh it's not your nose?

75
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:26,980
- [Woman] That's impressive.

76
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,235
- [Ellie] Perfect (laughing), thanks.

77
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:31,748
That escalated extremely quickly

78
00:03:31,748 --> 00:03:35,915
from going from absolutely
no costumes to that bad boy,

79
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:41,123
oh no, now we got a
horse, neigh, (laughing).

80
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:47,866
- [Jackson] Where is my eyes.

81
00:03:47,866 --> 00:03:50,199
- [Ellie] Where's your eyes?

82
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:55,056
- Alright kiddos here's the deal.

83
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:58,306
Here's the situation I have been on my,

84
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,164
oh no, oh no, oh no, I came
roaring down the stairs

85
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:07,841
and you were asleep, I'm
so sorry, I'm so sorry.

86
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,501
So here's the situation, (laughing),

87
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,408
I have been in my office since six AM

88
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:16,201
it is now six PM I have been on my butt

89
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:18,701
working for 12 hours straight.

90
00:04:19,851 --> 00:04:21,914
And my bum is upset with me, my bum.

91
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:23,835
- [Ellie] Literally it has been.

92
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:25,341
- [Jared] Yeah, my bum does not like me.

93
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:26,832
- [Ellie] Aw, you need to poop?

94
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:28,462
- Well no not poop, it's just

95
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:31,206
I saw on Facebook you know these

96
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:33,853
purple mattresses that you see everywhere.

97
00:04:33,853 --> 00:04:35,738
They have a seat cushion and I was like

98
00:04:35,738 --> 00:04:38,379
my butt hates me right
now, I should get one.

99
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,212
- No to be honest, I would love to

100
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:45,157
I wanna try a pillow out,
'cause I love my mattress.

101
00:04:45,157 --> 00:04:46,014
- [Jared] Oh yeah.

102
00:04:46,014 --> 00:04:47,490
- And I love the mattresses we have

103
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,015
at the house, but I want to try a pillow.

104
00:04:51,015 --> 00:04:51,955
- You wanna try a pillow, I think

105
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:54,459
that would be a great
idea, hey still like them.

106
00:04:54,459 --> 00:04:57,942
'Kay they still like
them from this morning.

107
00:04:57,942 --> 00:05:00,920
Me on the other hand I'm not quite sure.

108
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,681
Can you whistle, no really loud
come on whistle really loud.

109
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:07,339
(Calvin yelling)

110
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,045
(everyone laughing)

111
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:11,921
That's a good whistle.

112
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,588
- You're a goofball.

113
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:18,713
- Do you want me to
show you how it's done?

114
00:05:18,713 --> 00:05:20,829
Ready, can I do it with this hand?

115
00:05:20,829 --> 00:05:21,662
- [Ellie] Try it.

116
00:05:21,662 --> 00:05:25,829
- Am I an ambi-whistler,
(whistles) you try.

117
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:31,463
- (mumbles).

118
00:05:31,463 --> 00:05:34,503
Okay, so tonight is pumpkin carving night.

119
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:37,645
We are gonna parve, we're
gonna parve, cumpkins, oh geez.

120
00:05:37,645 --> 00:05:39,421
We're going to carve pumpkins tonight.

121
00:05:39,421 --> 00:05:40,728
- I think you lost some
brain cells (mumbles).

122
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:42,560
- I did, so if you remember I asked

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,289
you guys like a week or two ago.

124
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,283
What I should carve on a pumpkin.

125
00:05:46,283 --> 00:05:48,972
I take pumpkin carving
very, very seriously.

126
00:05:48,972 --> 00:05:51,514
And you guys voted and you guys gave

127
00:05:51,514 --> 00:05:53,562
thumbs up to a specific comment.

128
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:57,729
And the highest comment
was overwhelmingly, guess.

129
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,517
- Penny.

130
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:03,684
- Yes you are right, Penny is
the pumpkin of choice today.

131
00:06:05,377 --> 00:06:06,693
So what I'm gonna do with you guys,

132
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:07,932
is I'm gonna show you the process

133
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,542
that I normally take when I carve

134
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:12,886
what I think is a pretty detailed pumpkin.

135
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:14,739
I'll show you step by
step and then hopefully

136
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,877
it'll turn out the way that I want.

137
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,297
- And these are the pumpkins
that he has carved, previously.

138
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,534
- [Jared] Bing, bing, bing, bing.

139
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:23,367
- Mom and dad just texted me and said

140
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,854
that they're gonna come say hi.

141
00:06:24,854 --> 00:06:27,304
- Oh fun, that's great,
maybe they'll see my pumpkin.

142
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,668
- [Ellie] Yeah it's gonna take all night.

143
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,675
- Actually it'll probably
take me the whole night, yeah.

144
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:32,576
I gotta start now if I wanna finish today.

145
00:06:32,576 --> 00:06:34,320
Okay so I am at my computer right now.

146
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,381
And I have a picture of Penny
loaded up here in Photoshop.

147
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:39,524
And essentially what we're gonna do

148
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,375
it's pretty simple, and I think

149
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,074
you can do it in mostly other

150
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:46,016
software packages too, it
doesn't have to be Photoshop.

151
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,075
In fact I think there's some online

152
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:49,130
tools that you can do it for free too.

153
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,599
But essentially what we're gonna do is,

154
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:52,710
we're going to, make the picture

155
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,140
black and white, and create it

156
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,646
so it can be used as a stencil.

157
00:06:56,646 --> 00:06:58,922
And that's only a few
steps it's really easy.

158
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:01,397
On here, is we're just gonna go to,

159
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,318
hit command, shift, U, and that

160
00:07:03,318 --> 00:07:06,844
will turn it into
gray-scale, black and white.

161
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,554
From there, what you do is, we're

162
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,705
gonna increase the
contrast, so the white's

163
00:07:11,705 --> 00:07:14,240
are white and the dark's are dark.

164
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,102
And this just makes it
so there's not as many

165
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,167
layers that we're cutting
through on the pumpkin.

166
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,355
You can do that a couple different ways.

167
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:21,536
You can go through levels or you

168
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:23,465
can just go to brightness and contrast.

169
00:07:23,465 --> 00:07:25,576
And you just boost that contrast up.

170
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,267
And because Penny is a yellow lab,

171
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:29,839
and the contrast is already really,

172
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,267
really great, I'm gonna lower

173
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:33,622
the brightness down just a smidge

174
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,417
and then boost that contrast up.

175
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,722
And each picture is gonna vary

176
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:39,208
differently depending
on what you're doing.

177
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,789
So hit okay on that, and then from there.

178
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,305
I mean this is a pretty good
idea of what you would get.

179
00:07:46,305 --> 00:07:48,521
But we can take it a couple steps further.

180
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:50,088
And for that you would just go to,

181
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:53,014
back to adjustments, and
then you'd hit threshold.

182
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,548
And that's gonna take it into

183
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:58,100
very, very finite layers, although

184
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,707
your threshold level says differently,

185
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,109
you can see that there's only a couple

186
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:03,764
of different colors,
they're white and black,

187
00:08:03,764 --> 00:08:05,136
it doesn't do like to many grays.

188
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:07,330
And you can adjust that, and see where

189
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,161
your blacks are reaching out.

190
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:11,878
And that sort of thing, and
to where you want it to be.

191
00:08:11,878 --> 00:08:13,242
Now I played with it a little bit earlier.

192
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,951
And I got one I like pretty well.

193
00:08:14,951 --> 00:08:16,313
And it kinda looks like this.

194
00:08:16,313 --> 00:08:19,124
So I took the exposure
tool and I brushed around

195
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,216
her ears a little bit more here and here

196
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:23,378
so you could see that, and I created

197
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,253
the white in her eyes a little bit.

198
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:26,297
This is what it would look like

199
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,786
on the pumpkin, if you wanna see

200
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:29,099
what it would look like as a stencil

201
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,231
just hit command, I,
control, I on Windows.

202
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:35,041
And that will invert it and
that's essentially your stencil.

203
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:37,096
And in this situation, what you would do

204
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:38,721
is you would dot out and cut out

205
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:41,998
the black parts, and
leave the white parts.

206
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:43,602
For the pumpkin to actually show through.

207
00:08:43,602 --> 00:08:44,898
The next step that you're gonna wanna take

208
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,106
is either get your family and your kids

209
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,140
to do this together, or like we did

210
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:50,791
wait til our kids fall asleep

211
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:53,995
so there's no distractions whatsoever.

212
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:56,580
It's late and our kids,
it's bedtime for our kids.

213
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,819
So what we're gonna do now is

214
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:00,627
we're gonna get our table area set up.

215
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,971
We're gonna cut out the
top part of the pumpkin.

216
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,694
And then, empty it out,
shave out the inside.

217
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:08,300
You know what you do, normally

218
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,569
do with a pumpkin when you carve it.

219
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:10,728
So we're gonna prepare the pumpkin.

220
00:09:10,728 --> 00:09:12,657
I like to put a little notch in my carving

221
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:14,970
so I know exactly where
it goes when I take it out

222
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,861
and so I can put it back
in really, really, quickly.

223
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:18,850
Then you're just gonna shave off

224
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:22,143
all the insides there, so you
have a nice clean pumpkin.

225
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:24,081
This part to me may be
one of the hardest parts.

226
00:09:24,081 --> 00:09:26,366
And that's getting your
stencil onto the pumpkin,

227
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:29,276
to where it lays out as flat as possible.

228
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:31,262
Because you're working with a flat piece

229
00:09:31,262 --> 00:09:33,952
of paper and a round pumpkin
it doesn't work all that well.

230
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:35,457
But I'm just using some thumbtacks

231
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:38,117
here to, or pushpins, to close it in there

232
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,940
and give it as good a seal as I can.

233
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,455
And here's my Penny stencil.

234
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,541
What are you carving today Ellie?

235
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,144
- The easiest thing I could find.

236
00:09:45,144 --> 00:09:46,986
- From there it's just a matter

237
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,615
of using like a pushpin tool to like

238
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,536
outline your tracing so you can

239
00:09:52,536 --> 00:09:54,975
take the paper off and start carving.

240
00:09:54,975 --> 00:09:56,989
Sometimes what I'll do is I will,

241
00:09:56,989 --> 00:09:59,225
if I have multiple layers, or shades.

242
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,510
I'll fill out that layer
and then I'll mark it

243
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:06,024
with that letter, or the layer
number that I want it to be.

244
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,607
(upbeat music)

245
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,783
Now if you did this right, and you didn't

246
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:19,405
make any mistakes, 'cause I never ever do.

247
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:20,680
You should be able to take this off

248
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,898
and essentially see your pattern.

249
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:25,898
Right there, you see it?

250
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:30,732
So now, I've just gotta shade,

251
00:10:30,732 --> 00:10:34,315
all of the places that
are not punched out.

252
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:37,221
And that's gonna take a long time.

253
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,091
Now for most pumpkins, simple pumpkin

254
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:40,867
carving tools, oh those all just fell,

255
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:43,076
will do just fine, I'm doing some

256
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:44,391
shading and everything so I actually

257
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:46,361
just use like wood carving tools.

258
00:10:46,361 --> 00:10:47,763
And they have different angles

259
00:10:47,763 --> 00:10:49,707
and different tools so you can like

260
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:52,960
swipe down and it'll pull
some pumpkin stuff off.

261
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,855
Or different like edging tools.

262
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,436
So it just makes it a little easier.

263
00:10:56,436 --> 00:10:58,043
I think everything that I do here

264
00:10:58,043 --> 00:10:59,799
I could do with those as well.

265
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,216
(soft music)

266
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:10,301
After I took the X-Acto knife

267
00:11:10,301 --> 00:11:12,906
and basically outlined all the dots.

268
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,739
Now I'm just going
through and like carving,

269
00:11:14,739 --> 00:11:18,987
shading off, all those
pieces off the skin,

270
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:22,896
off the pumpkin, and
then I'll smooth it out.

271
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,313
(soft music)

272
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,342
I've done all the initial shading,

273
00:11:42,342 --> 00:11:43,911
it's just one layer right now.

274
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,425
And I'm going to hit the lights

275
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:46,498
and see what it looks like, but

276
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,386
I wanna show you what it looks like

277
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:49,217
first before the lights are hit.

278
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,656
That, is what I've got so far.

279
00:11:51,656 --> 00:11:52,648
I feel like it's pretty good.

280
00:11:52,648 --> 00:11:54,762
Obviously there's some ridges

281
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:56,792
so if I could smooth
that out that'd be great.

282
00:11:56,792 --> 00:11:58,721
But I don't think you'll see it

283
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:01,836
in the light, you know what I mean?

284
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:02,669
- I like the texture.

285
00:12:02,669 --> 00:12:03,502
- [Jared] You do?

286
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:04,335
- She's a puppy.

287
00:12:04,335 --> 00:12:06,524
- [Jared] It's a cute
little doggy, let's light it

288
00:12:06,524 --> 00:12:08,737
up don't you think, I'll
see what it looks like.

289
00:12:08,737 --> 00:12:10,091
One other very important thing

290
00:12:10,091 --> 00:12:11,421
is when you're doing pumpkin

291
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:13,299
carving and everything it's very

292
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,174
important that you bring along

293
00:12:15,174 --> 00:12:17,354
your favorite drink with yah,
'kay, and maybe like Netflix.

294
00:12:17,354 --> 00:12:18,187
- [Ellie] And chill.

295
00:12:18,187 --> 00:12:19,249
- [Jared] Yeah, it's not quite showing

296
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:20,648
the light that I want it to,

297
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:23,604
it actually looks a lot better in camera.

298
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:25,368
But I've gotta do a couple things.

299
00:12:25,368 --> 00:12:27,143
So I'm gonna flip on the
lights and explain to you.

300
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:28,625
If you're not getting
the light that you want

301
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:29,848
on the outside of the pumpkin,

302
00:12:29,848 --> 00:12:33,005
the easiest way to get more light through.

303
00:12:33,005 --> 00:12:35,304
Is to just shave off the inside.

304
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:37,345
So all you do is you take your scraper.

305
00:12:37,345 --> 00:12:39,319
And just scrape on the inside
of the pumpkin, that will

306
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:42,290
thin the layer out and then
you have a brighter pumpkin.

307
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,235
Okay, it's 12:30 in the morning,

308
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:47,580
I feel like I'm gonna call it
done I don't know, we'll see.

309
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,988
- [Ellie] It's beautiful,
it's good, show it.

310
00:12:48,988 --> 00:12:49,821
- [Jared] You think it's good?

311
00:12:49,821 --> 00:12:50,654
- [Ellie] Yep.

312
00:12:50,654 --> 00:12:52,717
- [Jared] Okay, so here is Penny.

313
00:12:52,717 --> 00:12:56,444
- [Ellie] Look it's perfect,
that is freaking Penny.

314
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:59,527
- [Jared] So good, aw Penny it's you.

315
00:13:01,609 --> 00:13:03,399
- [Ellie] And then there's the scary one.

316
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:07,095
- [Jared] That's the pirate
jack-o-lantern ar matey.

317
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:08,298
- [Ellie] Penny's beautiful.

318
00:13:08,298 --> 00:13:09,619
- [Jared] I think it looks so good,

319
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,286
it's like hyper realistic,
Penny that's you.

320
00:13:14,381 --> 00:13:16,490
That's you, you know that, huh?

321
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,208
Well guys I hope you enjoyed those

322
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:22,375
small tips for carving the
best pumpkin of your life.

323
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:24,661
That's what I've done for years

324
00:13:24,661 --> 00:13:27,057
and, I don't know, I
think it's pretty fun.

325
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:28,251
So I hope you enjoyed it, if you did

326
00:13:28,251 --> 00:13:29,917
give it a big thumbs up, let me know

327
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:31,981

this year for Halloween.

328
00:13:31,981 --> 00:13:35,008

and we will see you guys next time, bye.
