1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:04,529
Today we are touring
Guilin Bay, Shangri-La.

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:06,582
We're taking another boat tour

3
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:08,670
of these beautiful mountains.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,238
Oh my gosh, I've never
seen anything like it.

5
00:00:10,238 --> 00:00:12,352
I've never seen any mountains like this.

6
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:14,018
They just poof shoot up

7
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,410
out of nowhere.
Pointy.

8
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,107
We've gotta go right now
or we're gonna be late.

9
00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:19,462
I think everyone is gonna be down there,

10
00:00:19,462 --> 00:00:21,691
in approximately one minute ago.

11
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:22,524
(laughs)

12
00:00:22,524 --> 00:00:26,191
(traditional Chinese music)

13
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,992
So I take that back, we are early.

14
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:36,965
No one's here.
We're not late.

15
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:37,956
No one's here.

16
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,670
So either everyone is really late

17
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,151
and we're just normal late,

18
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:42,637
or we're on time or early

19
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:46,070
and everyone else is not quite early.

20
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,901
I'm not sure how to classify this,

21
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:50,293

really hard at us,

44
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,764
and he may have recorded us,

45
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:45,377
and so we are trying to find
a song we can all dance to

46
00:01:45,377 --> 00:01:48,293
and give him a good
show that he can record.

47
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,126
Anything for a show, right?

48
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:50,797
I think he thinks it's funny, yeah.

49
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:53,797
That is the party bus right there.

50
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:58,130
(atmospheric music)

51
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,121
I have an announcement to make,

00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:02,954

Everyone's waving,

that's cute.
(Jared laughing)

58
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,833
- [Jared] Oh safety first.

59
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:28,666
You know if you fall in,

60
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:29,620
you gotta be really careful.

61
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,453
- [Jared] Yeah.

62
00:02:30,453 --> 00:02:31,853
Sometimes you just gotta float.

63
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:32,881
- [Jared] Right.

64
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:34,881
These mountains are so

65
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:41,367
like unbelievable, like
that looks like a painting.

66
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,367
(light jazzy music)

67
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,382
And we're on a cruise right now,

68
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,979
do you see the mountains behind me?

69
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,793
Yes, they're incredible.

70
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,345
Isn't that crazy?

71
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:03,766
I'm Facetiming my dad and
we're in China right now.

72
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,245
Isn't that crazy?

73
00:03:05,245 --> 00:03:06,449
- [Ellie] Hi.

74
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:07,282
Hi.

75
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:10,802
- [Ellie] Thanks for
taking care of our babies.

76
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:13,802
(light jazzy music)

77
00:03:35,821 --> 00:03:37,435
The best part about this three hour cruise

78
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:38,523
is not only the beauty,

79
00:03:38,523 --> 00:03:40,700
but the lunch is provided.

80
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,579
We're all in line, having lunch.

81
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,587
Bonnie is pulling up her pants,

82
00:03:43,587 --> 00:03:44,699
Jase is doing a dance.

83
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:46,321
We are walking through
the city of Yongzhou

84
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,154
(cars honking)

85
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:49,717
and all of the kids are
on a field trip right now.

86
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,896
All of the kids in the yellow hats

87
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:53,563
are on a field trip.

88
00:03:53,563 --> 00:03:56,068
It's just so fun to see
all the little kids.

89
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:57,100
(laughs)

90
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,874
It's crazy walking through this town.

91
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:01,139
You really had to get out of them.

92
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,371
Because everyone is trying

93
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:06,779
to sell you a taxi, sell you an item,

94
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:07,850
and they grab onto you and everything.

95
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,904
Oh I wasn't thinking that,

96
00:04:08,904 --> 00:04:10,768
I was thinking, get out of the streets,

97
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:11,694
because they will run you over.

98
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:13,519
Oh that's true too.
(cars honking)

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,119
The yellow one's don't stop.

100
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:17,113
I'm kind of just in awe
of the street right here,

101
00:04:17,113 --> 00:04:19,505
like this is unbelievable.

102
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:20,941
Tons of shops.

103
00:04:20,942 --> 00:04:23,805
Yeah, it's just, this is what I envisioned

104
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,388
inland China to be.

105
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:27,494
Look at this.

106
00:04:27,494 --> 00:04:29,525
This is so cool.

107
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,173
I did buy a sweater guys.

108
00:04:31,173 --> 00:04:33,383
- [Jared] Ooh let's see.

109
00:04:33,383 --> 00:04:34,977
Did you barter a good price?

110
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:36,081
Actually Bonnie did.

111
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,841
Honestly, it looks like Burberry,

112
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:39,825
like it's so nice.

113
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,169
- [Ellie] And it feels good.

114
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:42,002
- [Jared] Look at this.

115
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:44,502
Look at this alleyway.

116
00:04:44,502 --> 00:04:46,334
That's so cool, the Chinese lanterns,

117
00:04:46,334 --> 00:04:47,471
that's so awesome.

118
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:50,292
So Dad and I already
bought a gift for Jackson

119
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,374
and we are looking at
something for Calvin.

120
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:57,124
And I saw these cute nightlights.

121
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,496
Look how cute they are,

122
00:04:59,496 --> 00:05:01,425
and that one over there is a dog.

123
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,119
So she's checking the lights.

124
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:03,990
The bulbs in 'em.

125
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,562
Yeah.

126
00:05:05,562 --> 00:05:07,166
Aww, I think he'll really like that.

127
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,102
We got something for Jackson as well,

128
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,567
because we wanted both the
boys to have something like

129
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:15,042
from China, like Jackson's
was more like a toy

130
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:18,032
that we found, but he's gonna love.

131
00:05:18,032 --> 00:05:21,123
We got each of the boys a little drum.

132
00:05:21,123 --> 00:05:21,956
- [Ellie] Yes.

133
00:05:21,956 --> 00:05:23,319
It's hand made and everything.

134
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,152
And it looks really cool.

135
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,263
- [Ellie] I think Jackson
will really like it.

136
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,414
Yeah.

137
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:29,527
The next step on our
adventure is Shangri-La.

138
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,343
The city of heaven, is that what it is?

139
00:05:32,343 --> 00:05:33,219
Yeah.
This is beautiful.

140
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:34,052
Like everything else.
The most beautiful city

141
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:34,885
In the world.
It is just heaven.

142
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,383
- [Jared] Yeah, what?

143
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,216
It's just heaven.

144
00:05:37,216 --> 00:05:39,439
Oh just heaven, this is heaven.

145
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,272
- [Jase] You are in heaven.

146
00:05:40,272 --> 00:05:41,715
We made it Ellie.

147
00:05:41,715 --> 00:05:42,665
We did it.

148
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:43,498
(laughing)

149
00:05:43,498 --> 00:05:44,731
- [Jared] Ellie, we're here.

150
00:05:44,731 --> 00:05:45,564
After all this work, we're here.

151
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:46,759
No no, not without my babies.

152
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,583
- [Jared] So this is heaven.

153
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,723
(laughing)

154
00:05:50,723 --> 00:05:53,604
It sounds like you're being mean.

155
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:56,746
- [Ellie] You boys are
all being a little mean.

156
00:05:56,746 --> 00:05:59,199
- [Jared] Okay I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,032
The greenery and the trees,

158
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:01,815
everything is so different.

159
00:06:01,815 --> 00:06:04,982
And this tree is so interesting to me.

160
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:06,989
Look at the

161
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:11,695
Isn't that crazy?

162
00:06:11,695 --> 00:06:13,170
Thank you.
Nihao.

163
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,003
- [Ellie] We've been on some boats today,

164
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:16,753
but this one is another one, huh?

165
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,228
Come sit down next to me Ellie,

166
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,252
I saved you a seat.

167
00:06:21,252 --> 00:06:22,835
I saved you a seat.

168
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:26,217
Nihao.

169
00:06:26,217 --> 00:06:27,897
Hello.
Aloha.

170
00:06:27,897 --> 00:06:28,795
- [Jared] Hello.

171
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:31,050
We were talking about dinner

172
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,632
and the tour guide just offered us

173
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:34,465
Dog.

174
00:06:34,465 --> 00:06:35,825
Dog for dinner.

175
00:06:35,825 --> 00:06:38,168
You don't think we could woof that down?

176
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:39,715
It might be a little ruff.

177
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:43,847
Everyone made a joke and
I thought, no thank you.

178
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,708
But I guess dog is popular
here and the Philippines.

179
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,011
Look at this view Ellie.

180
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:50,936
- [Ellie] Everyone's gonna film it,

181
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,808
so I'm just gonna film everybody filming

182
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:55,061
what everyone wants to film.

183
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,144
(gentle piano music)

184
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:10,611
Oh hey ho hey I'm ready!

185
00:07:10,611 --> 00:07:12,422
I'm ready this time, I'm ready.

186
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:13,634
- [Natalie] It's all you,
it's all you, it's all you.

187
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:14,467
Oh!

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,881
(siren beat music)

189
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,164
Ahh, I'm gonna get one.

190
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:23,247
I'm gonna get one, I'm gonna get one.

191
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:25,971
Oh, no!

192
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,605
She said last one?

193
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:30,781
- [Woman] That be your
last, that's the end.

194
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:31,948
- [Ellie] Yay!

195
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,066
Yay, Jared!

196
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:35,899
(laughing)

197
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,087
- [Ellie] You did it.

198
00:07:37,087 --> 00:07:38,125
I got one.

199
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,948
What is it?

200
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:40,865
What is it?

201
00:07:42,597 --> 00:07:44,317
I feel like the little
kid at the baseball game

202
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:46,096
that catch a ball and--

203
00:07:46,096 --> 00:07:47,902
- [Richie] Here's your snow cone, bud.

204
00:07:47,902 --> 00:07:48,985
You get one for playing.

205
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:49,818
(speaking in foreign language)

206
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:51,264
(laughing)

207
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:52,740
- [Ellie] Wave to us, say hi.

208
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,657
- [All] Hi.

209
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,908
They've taken all of
our pictures a few times

210
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:01,788
and they love Jared.

211
00:08:01,788 --> 00:08:02,621
Everyone loves you,

212
00:08:02,621 --> 00:08:06,370
because Jared was cute
and did cute peace signs.

213
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,227
Well it's so funny, because they try

214
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:09,618
and sneak pictures of us.

215
00:08:09,618 --> 00:08:11,630
And so I see 'em doing
it, and I'm like nihao,

216
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,465
and so they want to do more.
And then they love it.

217
00:08:13,465 --> 00:08:14,968
And so every time they see us,

218
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:17,233
they stop to take pictures of us.

219
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,625
That was cute.
That's so funny.

220
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:19,580
This guy right there.

221
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,913
He's come to us a few times.

222
00:08:22,756 --> 00:08:23,839
That's funny.

223
00:08:28,994 --> 00:08:30,622
Did you get Olivia something?

224
00:08:30,622 --> 00:08:32,782
Yes, these are so cute.

225
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:35,679
Isn't it funny how we're on this fun trip

226
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:39,024
but the whole time we cannot
stop thinking about our babies?

227
00:08:39,024 --> 00:08:41,724
Everywhere we go it's like
oh Jackson would love that,

228
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:42,557
Calvin would love that,

229
00:08:42,557 --> 00:08:45,232
or our kid would be
screaming right now or.

230
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:47,482
(laughing)

231
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:53,067
- [Man] There's a smaller
one if you want, anybody?

232
00:08:53,067 --> 00:08:56,341
- [Woman] A little to the
left, a little to the left.

233
00:08:56,341 --> 00:08:57,341
Your turn.

234
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,591
(laughing)

235
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:04,622
(speaking in foreign language)

236
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:05,466
Today we are going on a hike,

237
00:09:05,466 --> 00:09:07,725
and we're hiking to the very top

238
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:08,919
of the rice terraces.

239
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:10,959
And you can see behind us just what kind

240
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,646
of scenery we have

241
00:09:12,646 --> 00:09:14,679
on the trip today, it's just beautiful.

242
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,774
The bus is rockin'.

243
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:16,717
(laughs) Yeah.

244
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:19,245
It is a bumpy ride.

245
00:09:19,245 --> 00:09:20,328
Whoa.
Woo!

246
00:09:21,164 --> 00:09:22,696
Are you okay?

247
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,529
Are you okay?

248
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,362
Woo!

249
00:09:24,362 --> 00:09:25,195
Hard to get a breath.

250
00:09:25,195 --> 00:09:26,408
I am out of breath and we just started.

251
00:09:26,408 --> 00:09:28,673
We are in the village of Ping'an.

252
00:09:28,673 --> 00:09:31,308
They're known for their hair here.

253
00:09:31,308 --> 00:09:34,545
When their hair is covered,
they're not married,

254
00:09:34,545 --> 00:09:36,688
and they don't want to show
their hair to the public.

255
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:38,249
But when they're married
and they have kids,

256
00:09:38,249 --> 00:09:40,796
they have their hair tied in a knot.

257
00:09:40,796 --> 00:09:41,763
On top.
So you'll see

258
00:09:41,763 --> 00:09:43,460
Uh-huh, just right in front.

259
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,150
So you'll see women,

260
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,911
I was walking ahead of
you, so I missed it.

261
00:09:46,911 --> 00:09:49,241
- [Jared] They'll have
knots right here on the hair

262
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,585
if they have kids.

263
00:09:50,585 --> 00:09:51,802
But if they don't,

264
00:09:51,802 --> 00:09:53,147
they'll pull their hair back
Their hair is covered.

265
00:09:53,147 --> 00:09:55,066
- [Jared] and it's like under a hat.

266
00:09:55,066 --> 00:09:56,765
Aww.
Yeah, isn't that cool?

267
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,605
And this is where we're hiking to.

268
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:00,438
- [Jared] Wow.

269
00:10:00,438 --> 00:10:03,021
- [Ellie] All the way up there.

270
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,149
- [Jared] Right there.

271
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:07,696
- [Ellie] No, oh I thought
you were pointing there.

272
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:08,529
- [Jared] Watch out there's a car!

273
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:09,362
Shhh.

274
00:10:09,362 --> 00:10:10,574
They said it's about an hour hike up

275
00:10:10,574 --> 00:10:12,662
and an hour hike back down.

276
00:10:12,662 --> 00:10:14,070
So I feel like

277
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,267
We're old ladies.

278
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:16,992
Come on all the old ladies.

279
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:20,575
(atmospheric guitar music)

280
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:56,551
- [Jared] Did it turn out good, it's good?

281
00:10:56,551 --> 00:10:58,407
(laughing)

282
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,578
Very good.
Beautiful.

283
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:00,411
- [Ellie] Thank you.

284
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,472
They wanted to take pictures with Ellie,

285
00:11:01,472 --> 00:11:02,564
because she has blonde hair.

286
00:11:02,564 --> 00:11:04,113
(laughs)

287
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:06,339
Okay, all of us, okay.

288
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,172
Hello, hi.

289
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:09,795
Nice to meet you.

290
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:11,767
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

291
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:12,836
- [Jared] Bye guys.

292
00:11:12,836 --> 00:11:13,836
Bye.
Bye.

293
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,803
(laughing)

294
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:17,636
What was that?

295
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,036
That was awesome.
That was nice.

296
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:20,052
I was offended they
didn't want my picture,

297
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:21,987
because my hair is brown.

298
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:24,290
- [Jared] You've got some blonde.

299
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,351
Blondish.

300
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,334
- [Jared] Ish.

301
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:27,873
We walked by and they
said hi to us earlier,

302
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:29,121
and they were kind of laughing

303
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:31,024
and I was like, are they making fun of us?

304
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,130
That's what I thought too.
That's so funny.

305
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,963
That's what I thought.

306
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:33,796
- [Jared] Yeah.

307
00:11:33,796 --> 00:11:34,809
And then they came down,

308
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:37,247
they're like, we want a picture
of you, beautiful blonde.

309
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:38,186
Well I first had thought,

310
00:11:38,186 --> 00:11:39,638
they were like will you
take a picture of us,

311
00:11:39,638 --> 00:11:40,471
I was like, yeah of course,

312
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:41,836
there's a beautiful landscape
and we'll take a picture

313
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:43,417
of you, maybe you can get a picture of us,

314
00:11:43,417 --> 00:11:44,250
we're all happy,

315
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,657
but they're like no, we want to take

316
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:48,865
a picture with you, beautiful, beautiful.

317
00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,186
(laughing)

318
00:11:50,186 --> 00:11:51,546
So then we got to know then
and now we're best friends.

319
00:11:51,546 --> 00:11:52,379
Yeah.

320
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,908
We shared WeChat and everything.

321
00:11:53,908 --> 00:11:55,286
(laughing)

322
00:11:55,286 --> 00:11:56,514
One more thing I forgot,

323
00:11:56,514 --> 00:11:58,714
so they came to me
afterwards and they're like

324
00:11:58,714 --> 00:11:59,823
is that your girlfriend?

325
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:01,615
Very pretty, very beautiful.

326
00:12:01,615 --> 00:12:03,407
And I was like, no that's my wife.

327
00:12:03,407 --> 00:12:07,626
And they said, oh wow,
congratulations, very lucky.

328
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,473
Oh.

329
00:12:08,473 --> 00:12:09,730
- [Jared] I am,

330
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,563
I am very lucky.

331
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,442
That was sweet of them.

332
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:13,659
This is fun.

333
00:12:13,659 --> 00:12:16,327
I really have enjoyed meeting people

334
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:17,678
in that kind of sense,

335
00:12:17,678 --> 00:12:19,687
like talking and saying hi,

336
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:24,329
but then also having our
lunch and dinner with people

337
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:27,294
from here, learning
more about your culture

338
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:31,039
and everything, that's been
really a fun experience too.

339
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:31,877
Vloggers in China.

340
00:12:31,877 --> 00:12:33,766
Hi.
Vloggers in China.

341
00:12:33,766 --> 00:12:35,872
- [Ellie] Don't get up
there, that's dangerous.

342
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,648
No climbing.

343
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:40,758
We hiked up
All the way up.

344
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,716
- [Ellie] This is beautiful.

345
00:12:43,716 --> 00:12:45,837
Like think of how long it took

346
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:48,214
to terrace all of these hills.

347
00:12:48,214 --> 00:12:50,490
- [Ellie] Well and how long
it still is taking them.

348
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,240
To harvest, you know?

349
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,124
That's like what all these people do.

350
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:59,397
This village is just
so beautiful and tiny.

351
00:12:59,397 --> 00:13:03,483
There's no one here,
except Red Bull umbrellas.

352
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,933
(laughs)

353
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:08,567
Out of any kind of umbrella,
you have Red Bull umbrellas.

354
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,742
That is so funny.

355
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:10,575
Look at that.

356
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:12,188
- [Child] Oh my gosh.

357
00:13:12,188 --> 00:13:13,821
- [Jared] Hi.

358
00:13:13,821 --> 00:13:15,628
Let's go to English.

359
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,009
- [Ellie] Did you hear that?

360
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:17,842
Are you filming?

361
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:19,089
Yeah.

362
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,520
Did you hear that?

363
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,353
Oh my gosh.
I'm like oh my gosh,

364
00:13:21,353 --> 00:13:23,012
And she goes oh my gosh.

365
00:13:23,012 --> 00:13:23,845
- [Jared] That's so cute.

366
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,212
She was so proud of herself.

367
00:13:25,212 --> 00:13:26,320
- [Jared] This says that these

368
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,480
are the earliest developed terraces.

369
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,064
Now these have been here,

370
00:13:31,064 --> 00:13:33,265
they took 200 years to do all of these

371
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:36,129
and they've been here
for more than 700 years.

372
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:40,718
So these are more than 700
years old, these terraces.

373
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:41,863
Isn't that crazy?

374
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,934
And they look great.

375
00:13:43,934 --> 00:13:45,996
Like how much maintenance does it take

376
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:48,854
to keep these terraces
going where they are.

377
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,080
We are winding down,

378
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,326
we've been traveling for
five hours today to get back

379
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,243
Which is why we look so awesome.

380
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:56,180
(laughs) by the airport

381
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,097
and then we fly out in the morning.

382
00:14:00,643 --> 00:14:03,537
I'm gonna vlog a clip real quick,

383
00:14:03,537 --> 00:14:05,432
so everyone be on your best behavior.

384
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:08,296
We are in our final hotel room.

385
00:14:08,296 --> 00:14:11,217
All of us are staying
here in this room tonight.

386
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:14,034
I'm not sure how we're all
gonna fit on this one bed.

387
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:14,923
All of us spoon to one side--

388
00:14:14,923 --> 00:14:16,336
- [Jared] Spoon one side,

389
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:18,908
and everyone has to rotate like hot dogs.

390
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:20,304
I claim little spoon.

391
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,084
(Jared laughing)

392
00:14:22,084 --> 00:14:24,085
No we're just hanging
out having dinner here.

393
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:26,639
This is like our final
hurrah or final goodbye.

394
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,962
Ellie, Bonnie, Joel and
I are leaving tomorrow

395
00:14:29,962 --> 00:14:30,848
and these guys are continuing.

396
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,058
Oh T, you're leaving tomorrow too.

397
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:36,021
And these guys are hanging
out a little bit later

398
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:37,325
with China.
It's going to be insane.

399
00:14:37,325 --> 00:14:39,093
Yeah, it's gonna be crazy.

400
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:41,537
So but that's it, that's China.

401
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:42,377
We did it.

402
00:14:42,377 --> 00:14:44,121
We had a blast, we worked hard,

403
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:44,954
we had fun.

404
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:46,384
Woo!
Give it up.

405
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,047
You guys did great.
Thank you guys.

406
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,788
You guys would love China.
Yes thank you.

407
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,739
Like we really need a million thumbs up.

408
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:52,616
Shishi.

409
00:14:52,616 --> 00:14:53,699
Shishi oh,

410
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:55,615
ooh yeah.

411
00:14:57,148 --> 00:14:58,092
Thank you guys for watching

412
00:14:58,092 --> 00:14:59,895
and we will see you tomorrow.

413
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,150
Bye.

414
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,983
Bye.

415
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:05,613
Wait, I never learned how to say goodbye.

416
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,446
Bye bye.
Zai Jian.

417
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:07,279
Hai Jian.

418
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,112
Perfect.
Zai Jian.

419
00:15:08,112 --> 00:15:09,291
Is that right?

420
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:10,407
- [T] Zai Jian.

421
00:15:10,407 --> 00:00:00,000
Zai Jian!
