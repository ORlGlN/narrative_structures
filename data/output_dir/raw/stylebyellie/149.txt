1
00:00:00,192 --> 00:00:02,275
- Guys, today is amazing.

2
00:00:04,596 --> 00:00:06,244
- I'm not sure we're speaking.

3
00:00:06,244 --> 00:00:07,077
- Oh geez.

4
00:00:07,077 --> 00:00:08,552
You can't use that forever.
- Fine, you're good.

5
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:09,385
- Yes I can.

6
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:10,218
- No.

7
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,051
- Say ah.

8
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:11,884
- Ah.

9
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,713
(Jared laughs)

10
00:00:13,713 --> 00:00:14,546
- Did it work?

11
00:00:14,546 --> 00:00:15,379
Do you like it?

12
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:17,379
Penny girl, hello hello.

13
00:00:18,213 --> 00:00:19,213
- New rocks.

14
00:00:20,322 --> 00:00:22,003
- [Elile] New rocks?

15
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:24,279
What are you and Calvin doin'?

16
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,789
- We're just throwing rocks over there.

17
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,331
- [Jared] Well we're finding
some pretty cool ones,

18
00:00:28,331 --> 00:00:29,164
look at these.

19
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:30,649
- Well I send them out to play

20
00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:33,581
and of course, the best thing to play with

21
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:34,414
Is that your rock?

22
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:35,504
- I'm finding one for you.

23
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,059
- [Ellie] Is to find rocks.

24
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,432
- Look at this one, this
one's a magical rock, watch.

25
00:00:39,432 --> 00:00:41,967
You just grab right here
and it'll disappear,

26
00:00:41,967 --> 00:00:45,292
but then magically come
right out of your ear.

27
00:00:45,292 --> 00:00:46,677
- [Ellie] Hey Mr. Jackson, do you want

28
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:48,244
to tell Daddy about school?

29
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:49,827
- I did my letters.

30
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:51,916
- You passed 'em all?

31
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:52,749
- Yeah.

32
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:55,716
- He's on level three.
- Good job.

33
00:00:55,716 --> 00:00:57,432
- Hey, we'll practice your
level three one's tonight.

34
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,561
- [Ellie] I can't tell who's
poopy, Penny or Calvin.

35
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,394
- No.

36
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:02,227
(Ellie laughs)

37
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:03,146
- When I was in college
I used to donate blood

38
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,374
quite a bit, and I wanted to
get back into doing that thing.

39
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:07,276
I have O negative blood,

40
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,357
I'm a universal donor.

41
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:11,834
And then the Las Vegas attacks happened,

42
00:01:11,834 --> 00:01:14,404
and just really, Ellie
and I have been talking,

43
00:01:14,404 --> 00:01:15,597
I should go donate blood,

44
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:16,852
I should go donate blood.

45
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:20,060
Our church is actually
doing a big blood drive now,

46
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,291
so I am on my way to the church

47
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,680
and I am going to go donate blood.

48
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,126
As much as I would like to admit

49
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:25,959
when I did this in college,

50
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:27,592
I was doing it out of
the goodness of my heart,

51
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:31,089
and it was, but a lot of was
also because you would get

52
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,221
a free t-shirt after donating blood.

53
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:35,349
Don't tell me you've
never done that before.

54
00:01:35,349 --> 00:01:36,869
I think in college I was the king

55
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:38,370
of getting free stuff.

56
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,898
Free food, free shirts,

57
00:01:39,898 --> 00:01:42,264
anytime there was something
that you could get out of it

58
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:43,496
for not doing anything,

59
00:01:43,496 --> 00:01:44,719
I would do that thing.

60
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,200
We had so many free shirts, Ellie

61
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,184
(laughs)

62
00:01:48,184 --> 00:01:49,100
Ellie would get mad at me

63
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,780
if I came home with another one.

64
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,536
She's like your closet is full

65
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,812
of free shirts and they don't fit anymore.

66
00:01:55,812 --> 00:01:57,698
I'm tossing them all.

67
00:01:57,698 --> 00:01:59,273
I love free stuff, who doesn't?

68
00:01:59,273 --> 00:02:00,281
Fancy seeing you here.

69
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:01,307
- I know.

70
00:02:01,307 --> 00:02:02,618
I didn't know you signed up to do this?

71
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:03,451
- Yeah.

72
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:06,113
I'm O negative, I'm a universal donor.

73
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:07,096
I should always be donating.

74
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,687
- I can't remember, I
thought I was O positive,

75
00:02:09,687 --> 00:02:11,464
but I think I'm B positive,
but I can't remember.

76
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,554
- [Jared] Are you positive about that.

77
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:14,637
- No.

78
00:02:14,637 --> 00:02:15,597
(laughing)

79
00:02:15,597 --> 00:02:17,899
- So here's the question
of the day for you.

80
00:02:17,899 --> 00:02:20,628
Have you ever fainted while giving blood?

81
00:02:20,628 --> 00:02:23,062
- No I haven't, but I've been turned down,

82
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:24,503
because I haven't weighed enough.

83
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:25,671
Oh

84
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,985
Funny that.
- I have never fainted

85
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:28,987
- I've never fainted giving blood,

86
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:31,683
but I'm always nervous
that it's gonna happen.

87
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:34,127
I've definitely had close times,

88
00:02:34,127 --> 00:02:35,682
where I'm like okay, I'm gettin' woozy,

89
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:36,515
- Yeah

90
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:37,348
- but I've never fainted.

91
00:02:37,348 --> 00:02:40,076
So he who does not faint, wins.

92
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:40,941
- That's right.

93
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,024
(bright jazzy music)

94
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,730
- How ya doing Mom?

95
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,563
Good?

96
00:02:57,563 --> 00:02:58,691
(Jared laughs)

97
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:01,331
Dang, that is a lot of blood

98
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:02,803
and that came from my body.

99
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:03,718
- [Man] That came from your body.

100
00:03:03,718 --> 00:03:04,551
- [Jared] No one else's.

101
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:05,431
- [Man] Nobody else's.

102
00:03:05,431 --> 00:03:06,424
- Just my body?

103
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,358
- [Man] Yeah.

104
00:03:07,358 --> 00:03:08,191
- My time was 8:43,

105
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,965
so I don't know if that's good or not,

106
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,950
no one else has asked for the time.

107
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,467
- [Man] Yeah, that's not great.

108
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,300
- It's not great?

109
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,133
- [Man] No.

110
00:03:15,133 --> 00:03:15,966
- People have gone faster than I have?

111
00:03:15,966 --> 00:03:16,800
- [Man] Oh yeah.

112
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,953
- I wasn't pumping that hard.

113
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:22,930
- Yeah, anything under five
minutes is considered bad.

114
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:24,265
- Oh I was way off.

115
00:03:24,265 --> 00:03:26,553
Now this is the best part
about donating blood.

116
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:27,553
Snack table.

117
00:03:29,545 --> 00:03:31,697
Apple juice and pretzels,

118
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,122
don't mind if I do.

119
00:03:33,122 --> 00:03:34,358
How'd you do Mom?

120
00:03:34,358 --> 00:03:35,191
- Good.

121
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,024
- Good?

122
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:36,857
Are you feeling dizzy?

123
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:37,835
- No not now, I was a little bit.

124
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:38,834
- [Jared] Oh.

125
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:40,872
- I like how they give us
the red cross on our arms.

126
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:42,843
- On your arm, yeah.

127
00:03:42,843 --> 00:03:44,479
Okay, I think we're good to go.

128
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,370
(Mom laughs)

129
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,203
Just kidding.

130
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:48,233
That's probably not funny to do here.

131
00:03:48,233 --> 00:03:49,066
- Not here.

132
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:50,516
- [Jared] I can't even keep up with you.

133
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,928
I can't

134
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:53,483
(laughing)

135
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,139
Hey, let's put your helmet on silly.

136
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,235
You are so fast.

137
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:59,052
Oh my goodness, you're
not just walking anymore,

138
00:03:59,052 --> 00:04:00,451
you're running.

139
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:01,284
- Bell.

140
00:04:01,284 --> 00:04:02,117
- [Jared] Yeah, ring it.

141
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:02,950
(bell dings)

142
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,783
Yeah!

143
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:06,190
I have an announcement that
I need everyone's attention.

144
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,289
Yes Brian, I want attention right now.

145
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,163
(blaster firing)

146
00:04:10,163 --> 00:04:11,390
You still like your blaster?

147
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,606
(laughs)

148
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,603
You still like it?

149
00:04:14,603 --> 00:04:17,137
I want to let you know
something here real quick.

150
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,154
- Dad, Mommy.
- Oh.

151
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:19,774
- Oh you make a difference.
- Dad, Mommy.

152
00:04:19,774 --> 00:04:21,426
- I made a difference today.

153
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:22,887
- Good job Jar, I'm proud of you.

154
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:23,720
- [Jared] Thanks

155
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,979
Do you know what I did today Jackson?

156
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:28,312
I donated blood from my arm.

157
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,013
They put a needle inside my arm

158
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:35,698
and they took the blood out for people

159
00:04:35,698 --> 00:04:38,185
who don't have as much blood and need it,

160
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:40,152
so we can save some peoples lives

161
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:41,746
- Oh.
- Hopefully.

162
00:04:41,746 --> 00:04:42,886
- [Jared] Is that cool?

163
00:04:42,886 --> 00:04:44,819
Is it nice to help people?

164
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:45,652
Yeah.

165
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,081
Who are you gonna help today?

166
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,007
- Spidey.

167
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,149
- [Jared] Are you gonna help Spiderman?

168
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,255
- I want to be Spiderman and help someone.

169
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:55,287
- [Jared] Oh that's such a great idea.

170
00:04:55,287 --> 00:04:56,583
That's so awesome.

171
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:57,931
Well let's put on your Spiderman costume.

172
00:04:57,931 --> 00:04:59,794
You haven't worn it in at least 12 hours.

173
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:02,214
You need to put it on
and save someone, okay?

174
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:03,047
- I don't want to put it on right now.

175
00:05:03,047 --> 00:05:04,494
- You're right, you're right,

176
00:05:04,494 --> 00:05:07,349
because not all superheroes wear capes.

177
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:09,141
My son is so mature.

178
00:05:09,141 --> 00:05:10,474
- You are silly.

179
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,071
- Seriously though,
seriously, how cute of Jackson

180
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:14,066
to say that, right?

181
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:16,793
- Guys, today is amazing.

182
00:05:16,793 --> 00:05:18,766
Do you remember our video with Andy,

183
00:05:18,766 --> 00:05:20,254
where they have not been able

184
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,004
to find anybody with what he has.

185
00:05:23,997 --> 00:05:24,941
Well?

186
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,529
- It sounds like from
Heidi texting me today

187
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:30,946
that they found a
perfect match in England,

188
00:05:30,946 --> 00:05:32,520
in England.

189
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,959
This is the power of the internet.

190
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:36,389
- I'm so so grateful.

191
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:37,769
- Yeah, how incredible is that.

192
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,113
So they've been talking,

193
00:05:39,113 --> 00:05:41,073
and hopefully, this means good news,

194
00:05:41,073 --> 00:05:42,846
sharing information from doctors

195
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:46,278
and ultimately the goal
here is to find out

196
00:05:46,278 --> 00:05:48,519
one, what's wrong with the brain

197
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:52,126
not telling the heart and the lungs to go

198
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,056
and then finding any causation to SIDS.

199
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:57,403
And hopefully we can prevent some things

200
00:05:57,403 --> 00:05:58,922
like that from happening again.

201
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:00,533
- Isn't that amazing?
- That is so amazing.

202
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,332
- We are so happy for them.

203
00:06:02,332 --> 00:06:04,364
That was the whole point of why

204
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,052
we and they wanted to make the video

205
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:07,524
is just to get it out there

206
00:06:07,524 --> 00:06:10,468
and ask, does anyone
know anything about this.

207
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:11,905
So we're grateful for that,

208
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:15,151
and Jared and I, we have
stayed in close contact,

209
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:17,928
and I hate to say IVF grant winners,

210
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:18,929
because it's more than that,

211
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:19,880
it's like they're our friends.

212
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,936
- They are our friends.

213
00:06:20,936 --> 00:06:22,627
- We have stayed in really close contact,

214
00:06:22,627 --> 00:06:23,460
sorry my arm's tired.

215
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,948
(laughs) Hard vlog.

216
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:26,332
- You gotta get your knee up there.

217
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,197
You gotta work out your
vlogging arm Ellie,

218
00:06:28,197 --> 00:06:29,224
you've gotta vlog a little more.

219
00:06:29,224 --> 00:06:30,057
- I know.

220
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,855
We've been staying in
contact with all of them,

221
00:06:31,855 --> 00:06:35,294
we have our little group that we talk to,

222
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:36,127
we've all cried together,

223
00:06:36,127 --> 00:06:38,197
we've all talked together,
laughed together.

224
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,688
- We share updates with each other,

225
00:06:39,688 --> 00:06:41,505
every time something goes on,

226
00:06:41,505 --> 00:06:43,135
we have this group message that we do.

227
00:06:43,135 --> 00:06:45,303
- They've been really good to us

228
00:06:45,303 --> 00:06:48,632
and we're so excited for Joan and John,

229
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:51,464
they are indeed expecting.

230
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:52,297
- Yes!

231
00:06:52,297 --> 00:06:53,557
- We are so happy for them.

232
00:06:53,557 --> 00:06:54,390
- Oh!

233
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,899
- Aaron and Riley, they
just had their baby shower.

234
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,788
We met her brother the other day.

235
00:06:58,788 --> 00:07:01,428
That was random, that was so fun.

236
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:04,333
- They're getting ready
to have their baby.

237
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:09,019
- Megan and Tyler, they're
so close to Aaron and Riley

238
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,352
in terms of pregnancy, their babies

239
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:12,265
are gonna be due or are gonna be born

240
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,304
within a week or two of each other.

241
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:16,263
So this is just an exciting time

242
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,501
and I just feel so grateful to have

243
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:22,033
even a small part in all of this.

244
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:24,424
- The word of mouth you reach

245
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:25,257
is amazing
- Yeah.

246
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:27,069
- and that's been a blessing.

247
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,582
There are four other of our friends

248
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,260
that are going through and getting ready

249
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,290
to go through the IVF process,

250
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,513
so we are so grateful for them

251
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:37,642
and we are so hopeful for them

252
00:07:37,642 --> 00:07:40,066
and we just wanted to
update you guys as well.

253
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:41,737
- Just upload that.

254
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:45,825
That was good, that was
smooth, no edits there.

255
00:07:45,825 --> 00:07:48,101
- Well sometimes when we
sit down to really talk,

256
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,644
especially about something
important, it's like

257
00:07:49,644 --> 00:07:50,883
- And something serious.

258
00:07:50,883 --> 00:07:53,803
- It's like one of the kids end up crying,

259
00:07:53,803 --> 00:07:56,932
Penny needs to go potty
or wants to come in,

260
00:07:56,932 --> 00:07:58,356
and it can be hectic,

261
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:01,446
but I was like, that went rather smooth.

262
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,004
- I think the only hiccup there

263
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:04,654
was your vlog arm.

264
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:05,487
- I know.

265
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:06,462
- You need to work out
your vlog arm a little bit.

266
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:07,295
- I know.

267
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:08,128
(laughing)

268
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,915
- Well I got got blood taken today too,

269
00:08:09,915 --> 00:08:10,904
- Yes you did.

270
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:12,775
- it just wasn't for what you did.

271
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:13,608
See that bruise there.

272
00:08:13,608 --> 00:08:14,441
- Yeah.

273
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:15,274
- Yeah, that was good, smooth.

274
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:16,976
- You'll get to my level
- High five.

275
00:08:16,976 --> 00:08:19,017
- of blood donating soon.

276
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:20,472
- You've got perfect blood.

277
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:21,752
- I should do this more.

278
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,376
I used to do it a lot.

279
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,121
- My dad always did it a lot.

280
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:27,621
- Yeah, so, donate your blood.

281
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,933
So it is officially official.

282
00:08:32,933 --> 00:08:36,840
I have changed my phone to the Pixel 2 XL,

283
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,871
and I know a lot of people
are probably thinking,

284
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:40,464
Jared what are you doing,

285
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,472
you know the display
issues are going crazy.

286
00:08:42,472 --> 00:08:44,361
Well I'm not doing it for the sole purpose

287
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:46,013
of the Pixel 2, I'm doing it more

288
00:08:46,013 --> 00:08:48,947
of an iPhone vs Android situation.

289
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:50,882
So I'm not taking the display

290
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:53,226
into that much consideration when I do it.

291
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:55,378
But I do have to be very
very careful about it,

292
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:57,810
because I am essentially
being shunned away

293
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,585
from family and friends.

294
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:02,858
Dad, what did you say to me
when I showed you my phone?

295
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,281
- I'm not sure we're speaking.

296
00:09:04,281 --> 00:09:05,824
- Oh geez, it's like you're not a part

297
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:07,624
of our family anymore.

298
00:09:07,624 --> 00:09:08,920
Brian stopped texting me,

299
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,140
because I'm a green bubble.

300
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,984
So I'm sorry,

301
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:14,873
I'm doing this out of
the goodness of my heart

302
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,192
to give to you, so you have the knowledge,

303
00:09:17,192 --> 00:09:18,801
if you're ever interested in that.

304
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,265
- Now you're iPhone's gone to pot.

305
00:09:20,265 --> 00:09:21,635
- It has, it really has.

306
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:24,234
Ellie sends me text messages all the time

307
00:09:24,234 --> 00:09:25,914
and they never show up on my phone

308
00:09:25,914 --> 00:09:26,747
as like a notification,

309
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:29,127
and do not disturb is not on.

310
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,567
So, experimentation.

311
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:34,614
But at any rate, we've
got a XL Hello Fresh

312
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:36,054
cooking right now.

313
00:09:36,054 --> 00:09:37,375
So we've got Mom and Dad over here,

314
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,615
we're gonna have dinner with them

315
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:41,598
as a happy family, despite the shunning.

316
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:42,431
(laughing)

317
00:09:42,431 --> 00:09:43,753
Grab Ultra.

318
00:09:43,753 --> 00:09:45,445
- Do you want to feed him?

319
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:46,981
Does he want to eat?

320
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,364
He does?

321
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:49,867
Here can you ahh for him?

322
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:50,700
- Ah.

323
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,149
- Come here, hold him
so he can take a bite.

324
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:52,982
Say ahh.

325
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:53,953
- Ahh.

326
00:09:53,953 --> 00:09:55,262
(Jared laughing)

327
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,444
- Did it work?

328
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:57,444
You like it?

329
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:01,626
Can you say ahh for him?

330
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:02,746
Here I'll feed him, say ahh.

331
00:10:02,746 --> 00:10:04,083
(growls)

332
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,174
Calvin, say ahh.

333
00:10:05,174 --> 00:10:06,232
- Ahh.

334
00:10:06,232 --> 00:10:08,655
(laughing)

335
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:10,107
- We've been trying to trick him.

336
00:10:10,107 --> 00:10:12,050
Calvin has been bringing toys up to us

337
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:16,442
and like ah, feed, you
know, he wants food.

338
00:10:16,442 --> 00:10:18,189
And so Ellie would pretend to feed him

339
00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:21,291
and then go to feed Calvin
and he would never do it,

340
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,996
So we're trying to trick him.

341
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,705
Just one bite, that's all you need

342
00:10:24,705 --> 00:10:26,142
to know you like it, right?

343
00:10:26,142 --> 00:10:27,008
We'll doing it one of these days.

344
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:30,237
- I failed today, but it's okay.

345
00:10:30,237 --> 00:10:32,487
(laughing)

346
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:36,729
- Hey.

347
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:38,598
Hey.
- Hey.

348
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:40,956
- Hey.
- Hey.

349
00:10:42,364 --> 00:10:44,614
- It is the kids best time.

350
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,473
And Jared has been up way late this week.

351
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:52,549
I mean doing one daily
vlog and then doing another

352
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:54,571
so that you're on track,

353
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,067
has been a little crazy.

354
00:10:56,067 --> 00:10:56,955
- It's been fine.

355
00:10:56,955 --> 00:10:57,954
- It's been fun.

356
00:10:57,954 --> 00:10:59,348
- But it's more work than I thought.

357
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,333
- Jared has been editing a lot

358
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,869
in preparation for Jared and I,

359
00:11:03,869 --> 00:11:06,144
for next week, we'll be gone

360
00:11:06,144 --> 00:11:09,295
for eight days, we are
going out of the country.

361
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:10,175
- Out of the country.

362
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,855
- And we have some business

363
00:11:11,855 --> 00:11:13,831
that we are doing.

364
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:15,420
And we are going to put these kids to bed

365
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,411
and then we're gonna put ourselves to bed.

366
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:19,247
- 'Cause I am pooped literally.

367
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:20,274
(laughing)

368
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:22,303
Like I am so tired,
throw me a squatty potty,

369
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:23,999
because I am pooped.

370
00:11:23,999 --> 00:11:25,312
I'll see myself out.

371
00:11:25,312 --> 00:11:27,152
- Did you see they came out
with a kids squatty potty?

372
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:28,639
- Yes I saw that.

373
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,853
And I was like, we
should totally get that.

374
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:32,573
- [Ellie] Tots.

375
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:35,632
I think I'm gonna look at
these kids play a little longer

376
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:38,239
and then we'll put 'em to bed.

377
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,072
Psssh, droid, Android.

378
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:44,129
Is that an Android?

379
00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:45,257
It's an Android, right?

380
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,408
- You have to be my support.

381
00:11:46,408 --> 00:11:48,727
- [Ellie] It's an Android, right?

382
00:11:48,727 --> 00:11:50,488
- Jackson, will you love me

383
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:52,680
if I switch to an Android?

384
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,552
- No.

385
00:11:53,552 --> 00:11:54,912
- What?

386
00:11:54,912 --> 00:11:56,487
My entire family is disowning me,

387
00:11:56,487 --> 00:11:58,610
because of this phone switch.

388
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,061
- Well Brian is, he texted me,

389
00:12:00,061 --> 00:12:01,485
'cause your texts aren't working.

390
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:02,696
- Oh well, what can you do?

391
00:12:02,696 --> 00:12:04,333
- [Ellie] Not do Android.

392
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,143
- I'm doing this for the people.

393
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,787
- [Ellie] Get off your butt.

394
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:10,173
- Kids come to me and I'll put you to bed.

395
00:12:10,173 --> 00:12:11,200
- Get off your bottom and say,

396
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,153
okay, let's put jammies
on, we both were like.

397
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:15,381
Don't you ever have those days?

398
00:12:15,381 --> 00:12:19,587
I feel like it just has
hit, like I can't get up.

399
00:12:19,587 --> 00:12:20,895
- But it's like, it wasn't even like

400
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:21,919
- [Ellie] A crazy day.

401
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:24,540
- It was just like a normal
day, but I'm just like woo.

402
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,322
- [Ellie] Well you did donate blood today.

403
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:27,731
- You know what, you're right,

404
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:29,261
you should put the kids to bed.

405
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:30,785
I donated blood today.

406
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:31,618
I did my part.

407
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:35,148
- [Ellie] I think I lost a lot
of blood giving birth to 'em.

408
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:37,093
I think that trumps all.

409
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,680
(laughing)

410
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,123
- You can't use that forever.
- Fine, you're good.

411
00:12:40,123 --> 00:12:40,956
- Yes I can.

412
00:12:40,956 --> 00:12:41,789
- No.

413
00:12:41,789 --> 00:12:43,210
- (slow motion) Yes I can.

414
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,121
I can use that forever.

415
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:45,954
- Can you?

416
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,751
Okay let me know in the
comments down below,

417
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:49,001
is Ellie allowed to use that
card for the rest of her life.

418
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:51,098
- Heavens no, I don't
care what anyone says,

419
00:12:51,098 --> 00:12:53,706
I can use child birth forever.

420
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,092
- Why is it that whenever I see you

421
00:12:55,092 --> 00:12:58,014
in that outfit, I just get really hungry?

422
00:12:58,014 --> 00:13:00,136
- 'Cause I like to wear donuts.

423
00:13:00,136 --> 00:13:01,709
- What does it say on the back of it?

424
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:04,450
It's like wake up for what?

425
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,996
Do do do do, do do do do.

426
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:07,829
- What?

427
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:08,756
- Anyway guys, it is time for bed.

428
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:09,610
- What was that?

429
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:11,859
- It's the turn down for what?

430
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:12,692
- Oh.

431
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,731
- That's what they're referencing there.

432
00:13:14,731 --> 00:13:15,842
Donut for what?

433
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,342
- Here catch this.

434
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,687
- That was terrible try me again.

435
00:13:19,687 --> 00:13:21,187
- Our game is off.

436
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,896
One more time.

437
00:13:24,896 --> 00:13:25,729
- Your throws are off.
- That was a bad one,

438
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:26,979
- one more time

439
00:13:28,117 --> 00:13:30,552
Your nose is hittin' 'em.

440
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:33,118
- I'm just gonna stay in one spot.

441
00:13:33,118 --> 00:13:33,951
Yeah!

442
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:37,268
Okay, we're gonna go to bed and clean up
