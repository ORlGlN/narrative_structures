1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:02,949
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:06,660
- [Jared] Good morning, Jackson!

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,928
- Good morning.

4
00:00:07,928 --> 00:00:09,739
- [Jared] Happy birthday, buddy!

5
00:00:09,739 --> 00:00:11,577
- Thank you.
(Jared laughs)

6
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:12,994
- Happy birthday!

7
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:16,584
Hi Calvin!

8
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:17,936
Hi bud!

9
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,298
- Does he have presents for me?

10
00:00:20,298 --> 00:00:22,177
- Maybe, he might!
- It's in my box?

11
00:00:22,177 --> 00:00:23,074
For me?
- Do you have a present

12
00:00:23,074 --> 00:00:23,907
for Jackson?

13
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:24,740
- Yeah!

14
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:28,161
- [Jared] Oh good, he said yeah!

15
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,606
Are you so excited for today?

16
00:00:30,606 --> 00:00:31,474
- Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:31,474 --> 00:00:33,464
- [Jared] How old are you today, Jackson?

18
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:34,588
- Four.

19
00:00:34,588 --> 00:00:36,421
- Four years old, yay!

20
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:39,670
- [Jackson] Am I four now?

21
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,990
- [Jared] You're four now!

22
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:41,864
- Yes!

23
00:00:41,864 --> 00:00:45,062
- [Jared] And you'll be
four for one whole year.

24
00:00:45,062 --> 00:00:46,126
- Year!

25
00:00:46,126 --> 00:00:47,911
- [Jared] Are you so excited to be four?

26
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:48,744
- Yeah.

27
00:00:48,744 --> 00:00:49,577
- [Jared] Yeah?

28
00:00:49,577 --> 00:00:50,410
Happy birthday!

29
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,393
We got some fun stuff
that we're gonna do today.

30
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:53,272
- Yes!

31
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,344
- [Jared] And I can't wait
to celebrate with you.

32
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:58,756
- Then these workers are at home,

33
00:00:58,756 --> 00:01:00,923
taking out to go to Lee's,

34
00:01:02,227 --> 00:01:05,870
and Mommy's gonna pick
up my birthday cake.

35
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,789
- Yep, your birthday cake is at Lee's

36
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:09,902
and we're gonna pick it up later today.

37
00:01:09,902 --> 00:01:10,902
- Yep.
- Yep.

38
00:01:12,678 --> 00:01:14,595
- Oh, ow, good morning.

39
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,087
Happy birthday breakfast!

40
00:01:19,455 --> 00:01:23,207
We're having oatmeal all together because,

41
00:01:23,207 --> 00:01:26,028
Jackson, you need to get
some energy built up in you.

42
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:27,757
You need to have all
the energy in the world,

43
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:31,928
because guess what we're
doing for your birthday?

44
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:35,011
Me and you are gonna go skiing today!

45
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,753
- Right now?

46
00:01:36,753 --> 00:01:38,564
- [Jared] In a few minutes, yeah!

47
00:01:38,564 --> 00:01:39,397
- Yay!

48
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,745
- So once you're all done with your cereal

49
00:01:40,745 --> 00:01:43,499
and Dad is all done packing
up, we're gonna go skiing.

50
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:44,960
And guess who's gonna go with us?

51
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,875
- [Jackson] What?

52
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,145
- [Jared] Uncle Joel and Boston.

53
00:01:48,145 --> 00:01:50,050
- What about Cody?

54
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,034
(Jared laughs)

55
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,513
- Cody's gonna be at school

56
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:54,872
today.
- Yeah, he'll be at school.

57
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,996
- But you're just excited to see Boston?

58
00:01:56,996 --> 00:02:00,396
- [Jackson] Mm-hmm.
(Jared laughs)

59
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:01,786
- I promise they like each other.

60
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:03,723
- They do like each other.
- Cody's important too.

61
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:04,556
- [Jared] Yep.

62
00:02:04,556 --> 00:02:06,544
It's been a year since we've gone!

63
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:07,377
- Where's my skis?

64
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,925
- [Jared] We've gotta go rent them.

65
00:02:08,925 --> 00:02:09,798
Sound good?
- Mm-hmm.

66
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,967
- [Jared] Okay, finish your
breakfast, and we'll go, okay?

67
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:14,373
- Mm-hmm.
- High five!

68
00:02:14,373 --> 00:02:16,290
- Bam!
- Happy birthday!

69
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:18,563
- Happy birthday.

70
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:23,113
- Jackson just asked, how
long will it be when I'm 20?

71
00:02:23,113 --> 00:02:25,677
And I was like, what age will I be?

72
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:29,010
I'll be 42 when Jackson is 20 years old.

73
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,369
42 is young, that's crazy!

74
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:36,702
- Someday I'm gonna turn 21.

75
00:02:38,553 --> 00:02:40,521
- [Ellie] I don't want
you to get that old,

76
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,769
'cause then you won't
be living in my house.

77
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:45,435
- But I don't wanna be gone.

78
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,754
- So you better not turn 20.

79
00:02:47,754 --> 00:02:49,587
- But I wanna turn 22.

80
00:02:50,632 --> 00:02:54,799
- Okay, you turn 22, but not
for many, many more years.

81
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,048
Okay?
- Yes!

82
00:02:57,048 --> 00:02:58,806
- [Ellie] Sound like a plan?

83
00:02:58,806 --> 00:03:00,531
You stay a kid?

84
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:02,607
- I don't want to stay a kid.

85
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,308
- [Ellie] Sounds good.

86
00:03:04,308 --> 00:03:07,213
I have Jackson's stuff all laid out,

87
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:11,228
and I'm putting a little
granola bar in his pocket,

88
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:13,129
because sometimes when
you're up on the mountain,

89
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:14,805
you're hungry.

90
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:17,228
'Kay, you have a granola bar in here

91
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:19,416
in case you guys get up there
and you want a bite to eat,

92
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:20,631
okay?

93
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:21,990
- I want it.

94
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,939
- [Ellie] You want it now?

95
00:03:22,939 --> 00:03:23,772
- Yeah.

96
00:03:23,772 --> 00:03:26,057
- [Ellie] Okay, wait till
you get up there, okay?

97
00:03:26,057 --> 00:03:28,178
Let's get dressed.

98
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,413
Are you excited?

99
00:03:29,413 --> 00:03:30,471
- Yes!

100
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:31,388
- Let's go!

101
00:03:33,058 --> 00:03:34,599
Whoo!

102
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:36,656
Okay, let's go get in the car
and we'll go pick up our boys,

103
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:38,041
okay?

104
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,000
Pick up Joel and Boston.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,218
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

106
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:43,603
- Look at the beauty of the mountain.

107
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:44,810
We made it!

108
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,242
We are here at Cherry
Peak, and if you saw that,

109
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,512
that's the parking lot.

110
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:51,738
No one else is here.

111
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:52,571
I'm excited,

112
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,188
I'm a little nervous because
there are no lights on.

113
00:03:56,188 --> 00:03:58,271
Oh, but the door is open.

114
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,882
The door's open.

115
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,024
Hello?

116
00:04:05,608 --> 00:04:06,441
Um.

117
00:04:09,638 --> 00:04:11,718
This is kinda crazy.

118
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:16,019
They're supposed to open
at 9, and it's like 9:40.

119
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,686
This is kinda weird.

120
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,107
Uh, let's see.

121
00:04:21,107 --> 00:04:23,451
I am positive it said 9 o'clock.

122
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,249
- I'm sure somebody is here.

123
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:28,079
Maybe they just need one
person for all four of us.

124
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,880
- I mean, I would not mind
having the mountain to ourselves.

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,132
- Did you reserve it, Jared?

126
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:33,299
- Just for us.

127
00:04:34,626 --> 00:04:36,123
I think maybe we'll drive,

128
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:38,969
maybe go up to the top
of the lodge and see?

129
00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:40,184
- [Joel] Yeah, is there a
parking spot over there?

130
00:04:40,184 --> 00:04:41,017
- Yeah let's go.

131
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:43,161
They can't be closed, they
would not leave that door open.

132
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,711
- We have to climb those rocks!

133
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:48,547
- [Jared] No, that's why
there's stairs over there.

134
00:04:48,547 --> 00:04:49,786
We're here, bud, you ready?

135
00:04:49,786 --> 00:04:50,619
- Yeah!

136
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:51,452
- Let's go over this way!

137
00:04:51,452 --> 00:04:55,439
So FedEx is here, and they
are just as confused and lost

138
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,564
as we are.

139
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,876
There's no one here.

140
00:04:57,876 --> 00:04:58,960
If FedEx is here,

141
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,341
I mean, they come on this route every day,

142
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:03,340
every week?
- I would assume,

143
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,173
every couple days.

144
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:06,170
- Yeah, so it's like, if FedEx is here,

145
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,760
there probably should be someone here.

146
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,871
- [Joel] There is one car over there,

147
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:10,199
but I wonder if it was left overnight.

148
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,003
- Well yeah, and that's
what I'm wondering too.

149
00:05:12,003 --> 00:05:14,304
There's a couple of options
that I can think of.

150
00:05:14,304 --> 00:05:17,391
One, we can just play right here.

151
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,417
- There's tubes that are out.

152
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:20,326
- Tubes, have a little fun.

153
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,409
Two, the door to get skis

154
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:24,793
is open.
(Joel laughs)

155
00:05:24,793 --> 00:05:27,209
we could grab some skis, the
power's right there to turn on

156
00:05:27,209 --> 00:05:28,042
the lift.

157
00:05:29,035 --> 00:05:31,457
Maybe we do that.
- Maybe just take over.

158
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,873
- Or three.

159
00:05:32,873 --> 00:05:34,149
- I'm gonna homestead this, Jared.

160
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,371
- Yeah.
- Squatter's rights.

161
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,437
- Seriously.

162
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,347
Would you have a flag we
can plant and claim it

163
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:39,264
as our own?

164
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:41,977
Isn't that how you do it?

165
00:05:41,977 --> 00:05:43,559
That's how they did it on the moon.

166
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,659
- That's how they did it in Far Away.

167
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:49,826
- So it is 9:55, technically,
the lifts open at 10am,

168
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:54,376
but the lodge opens at nine,
so I'm wondering if someone

169
00:05:54,376 --> 00:05:56,443
just didn't show up or something.

170
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,350
(kids squeal)
I'm kinda suspicious

171
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,044
about all of the doors that are unlocked.

172
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:01,696
It makes me feel like
someone should be here.

173
00:06:01,696 --> 00:06:04,832
And there's a light on at that lift.

174
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:06,441
- [Joel] Yeah, there's a light
on in the parking lot too.

175
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:07,274
- [Jared] Yeah.

176
00:06:07,274 --> 00:06:09,899
Hey, are you still having
fun on your birthday?

177
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:10,732
- Yeah.
- Good.

178
00:06:10,732 --> 00:06:12,721
It is well past 10 o'clock.

179
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:14,812
Gosh, their website, everything,

180
00:06:14,812 --> 00:06:17,875
said nine o'clock for this magic
carpet where they go skiing

181
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:20,449
right down this bunny hill.

182
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:22,102
We've got to do something.

183
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:23,370
- I'm assuming there's lack of snow,

184
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,992
so we're just gonna
play instead on our own.

185
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:25,973
- Yeah, exactly.

186
00:06:25,973 --> 00:06:27,638
So we're gonna take these tubes,

187
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,471
they're just sitting right over here,

188
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,797
and we're just gonna do a little tubing,

189
00:06:29,797 --> 00:06:32,113
just a little tubing, no harm, no foul.

190
00:06:32,113 --> 00:06:33,389
I don't think anyone will get mad.

191
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:34,599
- [Boston] Hey you guys!

192
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:35,909
- But we've got these tubes,
and we're gonna push the kids

193
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,426
up the hill just a little bit,

194
00:06:37,426 --> 00:06:38,752
and then we're gonna let them go down.

195
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:40,557
Just so we can say we did something today.

196
00:06:40,557 --> 00:06:42,501
It's his birthday, for pete's sake!

197
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,573
- It is.
- You know?

198
00:06:43,573 --> 00:06:44,912
It's his birthday.
- Happy birthday.

199
00:06:44,912 --> 00:06:46,945
The thing is, he's having the
time of his life right now.

200
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:48,225
- [Jared] He is, he really is.

201
00:06:48,225 --> 00:06:50,808
Look at that smile on his face.

202
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,349
Okay, you guys ready to go up the hill?

203
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:59,516
Just a little bit, just to
have a little fun, okay?

204
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:03,146
Right there, I think that'll be just fine.

205
00:07:03,146 --> 00:07:06,164
(Jackson grunts)
Nice, ooh, careful!

206
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:09,060
So you go right here,
we'll wait for Boston.

207
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,217
And then we'll let you go.

208
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:14,050
(upbeat music)
(kids squeal)

209
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,076
Here you go, Jacks!

210
00:07:15,076 --> 00:07:15,909
Whoo!

211
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:19,703
Okay!

212
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:23,056
- Yay!

213
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,983
(Jackson laughs)

214
00:07:35,203 --> 00:07:37,620
(kids laugh)

215
00:07:48,531 --> 00:07:50,781
- [Jared] Was that awesome?

216
00:07:51,673 --> 00:07:52,506
Go go!

217
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,056
I got Boston!

218
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:04,460
- I jumped!

219
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,293
- You did!

220
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:11,377
Oh, you know what, I
think this is turning out

221
00:08:11,377 --> 00:08:12,646
better than skiing.

222
00:08:12,646 --> 00:08:13,990
This is pretty dang fun.

223
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,618
- They're already drenched.

224
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:16,451
- Dad!

225
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,984
I never jumped!

226
00:08:17,984 --> 00:08:19,242
- [Joel] Okay, go jump again.

227
00:08:19,242 --> 00:08:20,075
- Okay!

228
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:22,127
(Jared laughs)
- Okay.

229
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:24,255
- [Jared] There we go, those kids.

230
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:25,175
- [French Voice] Meanwhile.

231
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,425
- [Calvin] Um, let's do it!

232
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,880
(upbeat music)

233
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:41,895
- [Ellie] I think Jackson
is going to love this!

234
00:08:41,895 --> 00:08:44,651
Are you ready, my birthday boy?

235
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,734
- [Jared] Hi!

236
00:08:47,565 --> 00:08:49,815
- What do you think?
- What?

237
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,115
Look at this!

238
00:08:54,115 --> 00:08:56,203
- Why did you do this while we were gone?

239
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,054
- [Ellie] Because I thought you'd like it.

240
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,163
- [Jared] Jackson, the Spiderman

241
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,637
is as big as you are!

242
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:02,852
Look at that!

243
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:03,968
- [Ellie] Do you see your present?

244
00:09:03,968 --> 00:09:06,169
- Look how big this present--
- I see it, I see it!

245
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:07,234
- [Ellie] Good!

246
00:09:07,234 --> 00:09:09,562
- [Jared] This present is
as tall as you are, Jackson!

247
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,202
- I wanna open it up.

248
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:12,138
- [Ellie] Let's wait for your cousins

249
00:09:12,138 --> 00:09:14,638
and grandma and grandpa, okay?

250
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,865
- [Jared] Happy birthday!

251
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,236
- I'll take this off.

252
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,069
- Oh no!
- He can do it,

253
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,727
that's okay.
- That's all right.

254
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,114
That's so cool, huh?

255
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:24,947
- What is this?

256
00:09:24,947 --> 00:09:26,072
- [Ellie] I dunno, a little Spiderman

257
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,186
figurine.
- A little cake topper.

258
00:09:27,186 --> 00:09:28,355
- [Ellie] He's more excited about his cake

259
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,332
than anything.
- I know.

260
00:09:30,332 --> 00:09:31,165
'Cause he knows

261
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,366
he gets to eat it.
- Ooh, perfect,

262
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:33,616
just like that.

263
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,152
- [Jared] Happy birthday, bud.

264
00:09:36,152 --> 00:09:38,194
- [Ellie] Did you have
a fun outing with dad?

265
00:09:38,194 --> 00:09:39,077
- Yeah.

266
00:09:39,077 --> 00:09:41,788
- [Ellie] I heard the
skiing place was closed.

267
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:42,909
Did that make you sad?

268
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,556
- It makes me sad because
the website said it was open.

269
00:09:45,556 --> 00:09:47,403
But, you know what's funny?

270
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,166
- What?
- Boston said,

271
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:52,873
he's like, Jackson, that
was the best birthday ever.

272
00:09:52,873 --> 00:09:55,321
- [Ellie] Be nice, let go.

273
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,020
- Mom, we should put some candles on.

274
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,433
- [Ellie] Do you wanna do that?

275
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:00,800
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

276
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,870
- [Jared] You finding
the candles up there.

277
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,560
- [Ellie] I pray we have some.

278
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,060
- Uh-oh.
- Oh crap.

279
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,794
Please don't tell me we...

280
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:11,710
Oh look.

281
00:10:12,792 --> 00:10:14,717
- [Jared] Hold please,
while we find the candles.

282
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:16,119
Yay!

283
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,426
Mom found some!

284
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,878
Oh, are you hiding your
eyes so you don't see them?

285
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,211
It's a surprise.

286
00:10:23,391 --> 00:10:25,474
One.
- That's a good spot.

287
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,517
- [Jared] Two.

288
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:29,385
Three.

289
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,515
Oh yeah, get 'em spaced a little bit.

290
00:10:36,515 --> 00:10:37,751
Four.
- Perfect,

291
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,935
that's perfect.
- Good job, buddy.

292
00:10:39,935 --> 00:10:41,421
And then when everyone's over here,

293
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,789
we can light them, sing you a song,

294
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:46,902
you make a wish, and then
you can blow them out,

295
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,338
and we can have some cake and eat it too.

296
00:10:49,338 --> 00:10:51,343
- And open the presents.

297
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:52,310
- [Jared] That's a great idea.

298
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,307
Look how big that number four is.

299
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,657
That is just for you, Jackson,

300
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:56,863
and that Spiderman is so cool,

301
00:10:56,863 --> 00:10:58,122
huh?
- Uh-huh.

302
00:10:58,122 --> 00:10:58,955
Nope.

303
00:11:01,755 --> 00:11:03,737
- [Ellie] What about,

304
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:07,904
see all these people, these
all go together somehow.

305
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:11,493
- [Jackson] This one goes
here, this one goes here.

306
00:11:11,493 --> 00:11:14,651
- You are doing awesome with your puzzle.

307
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:16,061
I asked Jackson what he wanted to do

308
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:17,494
before his cousins came over,

309
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:20,635
and we sing him his birthday song,

310
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:24,122
and he wanted to do a puzzle with me,

311
00:11:24,122 --> 00:11:27,950
so we are sitting down and
he is doing an awesome job

312
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,200
at this puzzle.

313
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,855
Grandpa would be proud.

314
00:11:31,855 --> 00:11:35,570
Jackson is such a fun four-year-old.

315
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,555
Almost, once he blows out his candles.

316
00:11:37,555 --> 00:11:39,764
I enjoy having Jackson around.

317
00:11:39,764 --> 00:11:43,253
He is a good listener, I love
when we go into town together

318
00:11:43,253 --> 00:11:45,387
and we have lunch dates together.

319
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:48,438
If it's just me and him,
or me, him, and Cal,

320
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:49,771
or if Dad joins.

321
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:53,364
We just have a lot of fun together.

322
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:54,385
- I need a mouth.

323
00:11:54,385 --> 00:11:55,506
- [Ellie] You need a mouth?

324
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,940
He's not worried about what I'm saying.

325
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,523
He's worried.
- See?

326
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:00,908
- Yep, you need the mouth piece.

327
00:12:00,908 --> 00:12:02,690
He's worried about his puzzle.

328
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,971
I am always amazed at
how young Jackson is,

329
00:12:05,971 --> 00:12:09,173
but how considerate he
is towards other people.

330
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:13,595
He understands emotions, and
I feel like I don't often

331
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:14,951
see that in kids,

332
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:17,266
and I'm just so proud
and impressed with him.

333
00:12:17,266 --> 00:12:19,550
You did an awesome job.

334
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,633
- Thanks mom.

335
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:25,643
(door clicks open)

336
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:28,143
(kids squeal)

337
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,592
- That's so cute!
(women laugh)

338
00:12:35,592 --> 00:12:37,175
- [Ellie] It's like as tall as him.

339
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:38,561
- The pizza is finally here

340
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,332
so our party can officially start!

341
00:12:41,332 --> 00:12:42,165
You guys ready?

342
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:43,538
Hi mom and dad!

343
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:44,371
Hi guys!

344
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:46,604
- Hey!
- Okay, everyone

345
00:12:46,604 --> 00:12:48,523
got their birthday singing voices on?

346
00:12:48,523 --> 00:12:49,946
- [Ellie] Do you want your toy
here or do you wanna hold it?

347
00:12:49,946 --> 00:12:50,779
- I wanna hold it.

348
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,005
- That's a good idea.
- Okay.

349
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,058
- [Ellie] Okay, don't blow it out.

350
00:12:54,058 --> 00:12:55,768
He practiced outside of Grandpa's.

351
00:12:55,768 --> 00:13:00,213
- [Jared] He was doing
so good, it was so funny.

352
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:02,308
- [Ellie] Don't blow it out, okay?

353
00:13:02,308 --> 00:13:04,280
Don't blow it.
- Yep, Jackson.

354
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,354
- [Ellie] Jackson blows it out.

355
00:13:06,354 --> 00:13:08,911
- He's just told not to, and he's like,

356
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:11,078
he's like, you better not.

357
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:13,508
- I already know.

358
00:13:13,508 --> 00:13:15,044
- [Ellie] Ready Jackson?

359
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,250
What are you thinking?

360
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,088
- [Grandpa] Are you gonna make a wish?

361
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:20,300
- [Ellie] Are you excited?

362
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,560
Okay.

363
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,343
(match burns)

364
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:25,653

00:13:25,653 --> 00:13:28,039

366
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:32,395

(soft instrumental music)

370
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,116
- It's my little Jackson boy.

371
00:14:41,757 --> 00:14:44,090
(all cheer)

372
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:48,579
Good boy!

373
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:51,079
- [Jared] Happy birthday, bud!

374
00:14:52,436 --> 00:14:54,192
He gets down to business.

375
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:55,189
- [Ellie] Do you wanna eat one?

376
00:14:55,189 --> 00:14:56,443
Lick it?
- I wanna lick one.

377
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:58,162
- [Ellie] Wanna lick one?

378
00:14:58,162 --> 00:14:59,854
There is enough for
each of you to have one.

379
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,833
- [Jared] Yeah, how fun is that!

380
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,250
Don't bite it, don't bite it!

381
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:12,066
(women laugh)
Is that good?

382
00:15:12,066 --> 00:15:14,601
You gonna take another bite now?

383
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,934
(all laugh)

384
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:19,705
- [Ellie] You want a bite, Bos?

385
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,470
- I want a bite!

386
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,648
- [Jared] Okay, take a bite.

387
00:15:23,648 --> 00:15:26,608
Yeah, all of you at the same time!

388
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:28,579
Do it at the same time!

389
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:30,573
- [Ellie] Okay, on the count
of three, everyone take a bite.

390
00:15:30,573 --> 00:15:32,587
Get in there, come on, get in there!

391
00:15:32,587 --> 00:15:33,482
- [Jared] One, two, three!

392
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:35,246
Take a bite!
- Take a bite!

393
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:37,579
(all laugh)

394
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:41,419
- That's so funny!
- I get this end.

395
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,839
- [Jared] Mom, go ahead, take a bite.

396
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,672
Yeah!

397
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:47,690
- [Jackson] So good!

398
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,357
- [Jared] Okay, okay,
everyone has to do it.

399
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,194
Go ahead, dad.
- Hey, I like our tradition!

400
00:15:55,194 --> 00:15:57,325
- [Jared] Okay, mom.

401
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:59,239
- It is so tempting to, like, shove.

402
00:15:59,239 --> 00:16:00,072
- [Jared] I know!

403
00:16:00,072 --> 00:16:00,905
Okay, Bon.

404
00:16:00,905 --> 00:16:02,491
- I have lipstick on!
- You have to!

405
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:03,463
So does Ellie.

406
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,678
Just a little bit.

407
00:16:04,678 --> 00:16:05,511
Yeah!

408
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:09,591
(upbeat music)

409
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,858
- I open this one.

410
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:23,956
- [Jared] Out of all of them,

411
00:16:23,956 --> 00:16:27,373
you wanna open the one from Boston first?

412
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:33,553
They're having so much
fun with that Spiderman.

413
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,374
- [Ellie] That was nice of you, Boston!

414
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:37,946
Ooh!

415
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,423
- [Bonnie] Boston picked it out.

416
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,449
- [Ellie] Boston!

417
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:43,429
He loves it!
- What a great idea!

418
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:45,164
- [Ellie] What do you think, Jacks?

419
00:16:45,164 --> 00:16:46,540
- I wanna open this.

420
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,006
- [Ellie] That's so cute!

421
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,114
- [Jared] Spiderman pencils.

422
00:16:50,114 --> 00:16:51,779
- He wanted pencils?
- He will love it.

423
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,657
He will love it.
- Yeah.

424
00:16:53,657 --> 00:16:56,854
- [Ellie] Okay, maybe your
cousins can help open them.

425
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,050
- [Grandma] Who's that from?

426
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,958
- [Ellie] It's from momma.

427
00:16:59,958 --> 00:17:01,407
- [Jackson] Hot Wheel cars!

428
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:02,945
(Jared laughs)

429
00:17:02,945 --> 00:17:04,426
Hot Wheel cars!

430
00:17:04,426 --> 00:17:08,532
- [Jared] Wow, oh my goodness,
how many are in there?

431
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:10,088
- [Ellie] Look at how many!

432
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,979
- [Grandpa] Wow, look at all of those!

433
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:13,333
- Look at that.
- I think maybe it would be

434
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:17,319
fun if Boston and Calvin
helped open all of them up.

435
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,284
- [Jared] The box is
at the front, I think.

436
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:21,058
- Discs.
- Discs?

437
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:23,692
- You wanna open that one?
- Let's move this,

438
00:17:23,692 --> 00:17:24,981
let's move the wrapping.

439
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:26,194
You know what, Jackson?

440
00:17:26,194 --> 00:17:28,026
- [Jackson] Huh?

441
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:30,775
- [Ellie] We can get these
cars all out in a minute here.

442
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,525
- Ooh, foreshadowing.

443
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,630
- I want you to open this one.

444
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,545
- [Jared] You want me to
help you open this one?

445
00:17:38,545 --> 00:17:39,439
Okay.

446
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:40,731
- Open this one.
(Jared laughs)

447
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:42,132
- [Jared] You're covering your eyes?

448
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:43,000
Okay.

449
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,148
Okay, you can open your
eyes and open the box.

450
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,731
- [Boston] Open it.

451
00:17:48,322 --> 00:17:49,239
Squirt gun.

452
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,932
- [Jared] What is it?

453
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:55,182
It's a blaster!

454
00:17:56,278 --> 00:17:57,232
- [Jackson] What the heck?

455
00:17:57,232 --> 00:17:58,065
- [Jared] The heck.

456
00:17:58,065 --> 00:18:00,893
(Jared laughs)

457
00:18:00,893 --> 00:18:03,208
That's like one of those blasters
that we had at Dart Site,

458
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,207
huh?

459
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:05,483
- I wanna open it up.

460
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,365
- Okay, here I'll open it up for you.

461
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:09,199
So you can put all your discs right here,

462
00:18:09,199 --> 00:18:10,728
so when you're ready to shoot,

463
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:13,484
you can pull one out, and I
think you put it in there.

464
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:14,978
Oh, that's easy.

465
00:18:14,978 --> 00:18:16,777
- [Ellie] Wow!

466
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,108
(Ellie laughs)
(gun clicks)

467
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,529
Whoa!

468
00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:22,599
That was great!

469
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,812
- [Ellie] He wants to do it himself.

470
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,566
- No no no no,

471
00:18:25,566 --> 00:18:27,233
wait wait wait wait.

472
00:18:28,939 --> 00:18:31,010
Look at the blue card,
can you grab that card?

473
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,209
- [Ellie] Yeah, open that card.

474
00:18:32,209 --> 00:18:34,413
- [Jared] Do you want
us to read it to you?

475
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,652
- Hey, there's a little book!

476
00:18:36,652 --> 00:18:39,070
- [Ellie] That's cute, that's cute!

477
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:39,903
Perfect!

478
00:18:41,044 --> 00:18:42,851
- [Grandma] He can use the pencils he got!

479
00:18:42,851 --> 00:18:45,428
- Yeah!
(Bonnie laughs)

480
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:46,825
- [Bonnie] Wow!

481
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,283
- [Calvin] I give one!

482
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:50,622
- [Boston] What's that?

483
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:51,455
- Oh my goodness.
- It's a little--

484
00:18:51,455 --> 00:18:54,288
- [Ellie] It's a little wristband.

485
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,835
- What?
- Is that from Grandpa?

486
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:00,652
- It's gonna make me cry.

487
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:04,027
- Look, see, this is petrified wood.

488
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:08,490
That your grandpa Gray
found a long time ago,

489
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,243
and he brought it home, and he cut it,

490
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:14,230
and he polished it, just like
you're polishing your rocks.

491
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,156
You know your grandpa Gray did that too?

492
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:16,989
- Uh-uh.

493
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,023
- This is for you.
- Do you remember

494
00:19:19,023 --> 00:19:20,214
Grandpa Gray?
- To hang in your room.

495
00:19:20,214 --> 00:19:21,851
And you can have something
that grandpa Gray did.

496
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:23,615
- [Ellie] That is cool.

497
00:19:23,615 --> 00:19:25,198
- [Jared] Isn't that so cool?

498
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:26,707
It's beautiful.
- Open your big ones.

499
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,788
- [Ellie] That is cool, he will love that.

500
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,739
- I feel like I wanna take it.

501
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,512
- [Ellie] We'll hang it up.

502
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:35,262
- Thank you.
- Oh, you're welcome.

503
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:38,524
- [Jared] It's time for the grand finale.

504
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:40,941
(paper rips)

505
00:19:44,588 --> 00:19:46,049
- [Boston] Whoa!

506
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,408
There's a little monkey!

507
00:19:47,408 --> 00:19:48,910
- [Jared] Jacks, turn it around

508
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,400
and you can open the other side.

509
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,649
- Blue monkey!
- Whoa!

510
00:19:54,649 --> 00:19:56,306
- [Jackson] I wanna open up this box.

511
00:19:56,306 --> 00:19:57,188
- [Jared] Yeah!

512
00:19:57,188 --> 00:19:58,517
I do too!

513
00:19:58,517 --> 00:20:02,106
It looks like you can put all
your Hot Wheel cars in this.

514
00:20:02,106 --> 00:20:03,348
Isn't this awesome?

515
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:05,205
And you can put your cars in
here and you can send them

516
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,867
all the way down these loop-de-loops.

517
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:09,818
Is that cool?

518
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:11,654
- [Jackson] I wanna open it up right now.

519
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,303
- And then you can bring them over here

520
00:20:13,303 --> 00:20:15,010
and the dragon can eat them.

521
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:17,145
- Oh my goodness!
- Whoa!

522
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:18,808
- We've got King Kong,

523
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:21,833
we've got a dragon, and
we've got a little brother.

524
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:23,666
All equally dangerous.

525
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:27,340
- [Boston] Should we open this?

526
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,517
- I think we should.

527
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:31,182
Maybe Grandpa and I could
set the up for you guys

528
00:20:31,182 --> 00:20:33,053
while you play with your other stuff.

529
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:35,932
(Calvin babbles)
Yeah, isn't it so cool?

530
00:20:35,932 --> 00:20:38,515
(upbeat music)

531
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,144
It's done.

532
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:55,376
Are you ready to see this?

533
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:56,427
- [Kids] Yes!

534
00:20:56,427 --> 00:20:58,013
- [Jared] Let's go!

535
00:20:58,013 --> 00:21:00,109
Oh you guys are so much faster than I am!

536
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:02,094
Let's run, let's run!

537
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,859
Oh, you're closing your eyes.

538
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,379
- Oh, you're my cutie patootie.

539
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,522
He loves to do that.

540
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:12,265
- [Jared] Yeah, he likes
to be surprised, huh.

541
00:21:12,265 --> 00:21:13,390
- [Ellie] Keep closing them,

542
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,910
don't look yet.
- Don't run into the couch.

543
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,743
- [Ellie] Close your eyes,

544
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:17,430
close 'em close 'em close 'em.

545
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:18,708
What do you think, Jacks?

546
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,075
- [Jackson] Wow!

547
00:21:20,075 --> 00:21:22,242
- [Jared] Is this so cool?

548
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:26,220
Oh my goodness, look at it go!

549
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,067
Wow, wow, wow!

550
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,818
- [Ellie] Jackson, this is so cool!

551
00:21:30,818 --> 00:21:32,398
- [Jared] Look, and King
Kong tries to knock off

552
00:21:32,398 --> 00:21:33,820
your cars!

553
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,653
- [Boston] Really?

554
00:21:34,653 --> 00:21:36,086
- [Jared] Yeah, look.

555
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,684
- [Girl] Cool, I love
that it like spins around,

556
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:40,351
it's like, we're the Hot Wheels!

557
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:43,291
- [Jared] King Kong's gonna
fall all the way down!

558
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,856
Oh no!

559
00:21:44,856 --> 00:21:46,565
- [Boston] Oh no, get in the jet!

560
00:21:46,565 --> 00:21:49,136
- [Jared] There he goes, whoa!

561
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:51,317
Workin' at the car wash.

562
00:21:51,317 --> 00:21:52,620
- [Grandma] That's so cute!

563
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,860
- Look, you gotta fix your car!

564
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,778
Look, you got to work.
- You gotta detail it,

565
00:21:54,778 --> 00:21:57,028
okay?
- Mom, I wanna eat it.

566
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:00,925
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh, look at this!

567
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:03,050
(kids gasp)
Here, wait!

568
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,154
- [Child] Look here!

569
00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:07,761
- [Jared] All right, kids,
you have fun with that, okay?

570
00:22:07,761 --> 00:22:09,290
That's my favorite part right there,

571
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,355
seeing them all go down so quick.

572
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:13,781
Hey, let her rip, Jackson.

573
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:17,059
- [Boston] Hey, how do
they get to the top of it?

574
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:17,892
- [Ellie] Zoe, look!

575
00:22:17,892 --> 00:22:18,947
- [Jared] Ooh!

576
00:22:18,947 --> 00:22:21,955
And look, it goes right
into the driveway, the lift,

577
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:23,818
the elevator, that's what they're called.

578
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:26,028
(Jared laughs)
- I'm comin' down!

579
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:28,111
- This is so cool.
- Yeah.

580
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:32,795
- I may or may not have
seen Brian and Missy

581
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:35,290
talk about it, and their
advertising totally works

582
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:37,004
for me.
(Jared and Ellie laugh)

583
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,024
- Jacks, look!
- Plus, we got it on sale!

584
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,695
- We really did, it was
right after Christmas,

585
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:42,693
it was awesome.

586
00:22:42,693 --> 00:22:44,421
But this is right up Jacks' alley.

587
00:22:44,421 --> 00:22:46,823
- Yeah.
- He loves cars.

588
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,481
It's awesome.
- A gas station,

589
00:22:48,481 --> 00:22:51,261
a car wash, car detailing,

590
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:55,291
a jet and King Kong?
- Who could ask for more?

591
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,279
- I don't know!

592
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:58,552
I don't know!

593
00:22:58,552 --> 00:23:00,088
- I think I wanna Tweet already and say

594
00:23:00,088 --> 00:23:02,610
Jacks' birthday is not
sponsored by Hot Wheels.

595
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,950
(all laugh)

596
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,144
'Cause that's all he got.

597
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:08,032
- Have you had such a
fun day today, Jackson?

598
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,865
- Mm-hmm.

599
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:09,915
- Happy birthday.

600
00:23:09,915 --> 00:23:10,915
- Thank you!

601
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:12,757
Am I four?

602
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,118
- Yes you're four!
- You're four!

603
00:23:14,118 --> 00:23:16,365
- You're gonna be four for an entire year!

604
00:23:16,365 --> 00:23:18,335
Is that so crazy?

605
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:19,615
- [Jackson] And then next
year I'm gonna turn five.

606
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:21,045
- Next year.

607
00:23:21,045 --> 00:23:22,168
- Five is in a year.
- You are already

608
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,727
looking ahead, aren't you.

609
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:25,508
I wanted to tell you something.

610
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:29,508
I wanna tell you that
your mom and me and Calvin

611
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:33,477
love you so so very much.

612
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:35,416
And we are so grateful for you.

613
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:38,193
We are grateful that we
have you in our lives,

614
00:23:38,193 --> 00:23:40,090
we're grateful for the miracle

615
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,854
that you and your brother are,

616
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:45,831
and I'm so happy that
you're such a good example

617
00:23:45,831 --> 00:23:49,998
to your younger brother and
to your next younger brother.

618
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,553
- [Ellie] We love you, bud.

619
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,386
- I love you very much.

620
00:23:53,386 --> 00:23:54,219
- I love you.

621
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:55,210
- Happy birthday buddy.

622
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,227
- Thank you.

623
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,368
- He is so anxious.
- He's so wiggly.

624
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,620
Let him go.

625
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,484
- Go have fun!
- Go play.

626
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:00,420
- [Jared] Go play with your cousins.

627
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,106
- Jackson's cousins are
getting ready to head out

628
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,692
and we're gonna put on Cars 3.

629
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:08,311
We're gonna finish playing with our cars,

630
00:24:08,311 --> 00:24:09,922
watch the movie.

631
00:24:09,922 --> 00:24:13,104
I'm gonna post a picture,
but there's a picture

632
00:24:13,104 --> 00:24:14,804
of a Hot Wheel car that
we always got growing up

633
00:24:14,804 --> 00:24:15,797
at Christmas, and then Jackson's,

634
00:24:15,797 --> 00:24:17,615
all of his Hot Wheel cars.

635
00:24:17,615 --> 00:24:18,983
It's just fun to see, like,

636
00:24:18,983 --> 00:24:22,860
I have a bunch of my own that
are now his and Calvin's.

637
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,363
And now they have all new ones.

638
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,421
It's just so fun.
- Yeah.

639
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,955
- Today's been awesome.
- Today's been great.

640
00:24:26,955 --> 00:24:28,880
- It has been such a fun day.

641
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,281
It started off, we're like,
what the heck is going on?

642
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:34,512
We took a negative,
turned it into a positive,

643
00:24:34,512 --> 00:24:37,527
and it's just been fun to see
Jackson play with his cousins.

644
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:38,858
- Jackson, happy birthday.

645
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:40,019
- Happy birthday, buddy.

646
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,396
- We love you,

647
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,293
and we'll see you guys tomorrow.

648
00:24:42,293 --> 00:24:43,126
- Thanks for watching, bye!

649
00:24:43,126 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye!
- Happy birthday!
