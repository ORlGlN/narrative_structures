1
00:00:00,278 --> 00:00:01,709
- Where is Cody?
(bright music)

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:03,486
Where is Cody?

3
00:00:03,486 --> 00:00:04,319
- It is raging.

4
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,543
It is unforgiving.

5
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:06,434
It is the worst--

6
00:00:06,434 --> 00:00:08,335
Duck duck goose.

7
00:00:08,335 --> 00:00:09,168
- Wait, just kidding.

8
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:10,734
- [Jared] That's a bad example Mom.

9
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:12,308
- And I'm like oh my gosh.

10
00:00:12,308 --> 00:00:14,509
He counts to three, jump.

11
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:16,014
- Baby!

12
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:17,750
- [Jared] Baby.

13
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,849
- [Ellie] Do you want to hold the key?

14
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:22,932
The special key, don't lose it, okay?

15
00:00:23,888 --> 00:00:24,912
- Okay.

16
00:00:24,912 --> 00:00:28,628
- [Ellie] What is it for,
to get into the pool?

17
00:00:28,628 --> 00:00:30,044
(Ellie laughs)

18
00:00:30,044 --> 00:00:31,669
Are we gonna go on a special date?

19
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:32,502
- Yep.

20
00:00:32,502 --> 00:00:34,006
- What date are we gonna go on?

21
00:00:34,006 --> 00:00:34,956
- Pool!

22
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:35,789
- Pool.

23
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:37,116
Calvin's taking a nap.

24
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:38,939
I think this is the clubhouse.

25
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,524
And Daddy is editing.

26
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,591
We are gonna go swim.
- Why are we walking?

27
00:00:42,591 --> 00:00:44,094
- We're walking because it's not very far,

28
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:45,669
so we don't have to drive.

29
00:00:45,669 --> 00:00:46,502
- Is this it?

30
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:47,549
- I think so.

31
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,382
This is the clubhouse.

32
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:52,238
And the pool is outdoor.

33
00:00:53,397 --> 00:00:55,637
And it's actually kind of cold today

34
00:00:55,637 --> 00:00:58,237
and I think it's heated,

35
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:00,229
from what I think,

36
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:01,662
so we're gonna weight for
our cousins to get here

37
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,484
and we'll open the door for them okay?

38
00:01:03,484 --> 00:01:05,206
What do you think of it out there?

39
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:06,040
- It's great.

40
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,719
- [Ellie] It's great.

41
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,295
That's awesome.

42
00:01:09,295 --> 00:01:10,655
Let's go sit and wait.

43
00:01:10,655 --> 00:01:13,488
(Jackson humming)

44
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:24,134
(lively music)

45
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:27,503
- Where is Cody?

46
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:29,136
Where is Cody?

47
00:01:29,136 --> 00:01:30,911
Where is Cody?

48
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:32,775
Where is Cody?

49
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:34,447
Where is Cody?

50
00:01:34,447 --> 00:01:35,488
Where's Cody?

51
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,655
- Cody is--
- Where's Cody?

52
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,830
- [Ellie] He's coming back.

53
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,096
- Ah, I'm gonna eat my friends.

54
00:01:45,096 --> 00:01:46,244
- [Ellie] Don't eat your friends.

55
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:47,244
- I want to.

56
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:50,285
- [Ellie] That would hurt them.

57
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:51,758
(laughing)

58
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:52,892
Cody's gonna be back soon.

59
00:01:52,892 --> 00:01:55,977
Daddy has the biggest
headache in the world.

60
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:56,810
- Why?

61
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,417
- [Ellie] So I told him to
close his eyes for a minute.

62
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:00,749
The kids are up for naps,

63
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:02,638
out of the pool,

64
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:04,621
climbing up a red mountain.

65
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,662
It's pretty sweet.

66
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:08,610
How cute are those boys.

67
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,610
Look at his little body.

68
00:02:13,354 --> 00:02:15,181
What a fun little back yard.

69
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,357
They like to climb all the way to the top,

70
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:19,287
take rocks and throw them.

71
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:22,119
Have you had fun on our
little adventure getaway?

72
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:23,014
- Mmm-hmm.

73
00:02:23,014 --> 00:02:24,812
- What has been your favorite part?

74
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,769
- Going at the water place.

75
00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:30,247
- The water, that was fun.

76
00:02:30,247 --> 00:02:31,836
Sneaky mister sneaker
pants, what are you doing?

77
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,623
(laughing)

78
00:02:33,623 --> 00:02:34,994
- But I don't want to go yet.

79
00:02:34,994 --> 00:02:36,382
- We're not gonna go.

80
00:02:36,382 --> 00:02:38,168
We're gonna stay one more night.

81
00:02:38,168 --> 00:02:39,088
- Forever?

82
00:02:39,088 --> 00:02:40,904
- Not forever, just one more night.

83
00:02:40,904 --> 00:02:43,898
- But I want to stay here forever.

84
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:44,731
- If we stay here forever,

85
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,979
we won't be able to come
back and have fun again.

86
00:02:46,979 --> 00:02:50,586
- Well guys I tell ya, 2018
is already off to a start

87
00:02:50,586 --> 00:02:51,621
and I'm not even quite sure

88
00:02:51,621 --> 00:02:53,830
what kind of start it is just yet.

89
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,309
I just know that this headache that I have

90
00:02:56,309 --> 00:02:58,438
is raging, it is unforgiving,

91
00:02:58,438 --> 00:03:00,629
it is the worst, it is
the kind that is behind

92
00:03:00,629 --> 00:03:04,826
your eyeballs that you just like uuuhhhh.

93
00:03:04,826 --> 00:03:06,275
But I will power through it,

94
00:03:06,275 --> 00:03:07,108
I will get through it,

95
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,852
because we're having fun today.

96
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:10,596
We're with our friends,
we're with our family,

97
00:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,124
we're having a blast.

98
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:13,339
But you know what they say,

99
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:15,323
new year, new me,

100
00:03:15,323 --> 00:03:16,886
and I think a shower will help that,

101
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:20,577
because the 2017 Jared, is kinda stinky.

102
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,402
Oh I can feel 2017
(jazzy bright music)

103
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,485

104
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:30,856

00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:31,972

Oh man, my head already
feels so much better.

110
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,053
My headache is nearly gone

111
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:46,886
and I'm pretty sure what happened

112
00:03:46,886 --> 00:03:48,318
is I probably transferred my headache

113
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:49,885
to some of you, because of my singing,

114
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:52,342
so sorry about that, wasn't that great,

115
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,701
you probably got a headache.

116
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:54,884
New year, new headache.

117
00:03:54,884 --> 00:03:56,640
Alrighty Joel, what do you think,

118
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,206
what do you think, what do you think?

119
00:03:58,206 --> 00:03:59,039
- I like your shirt.

120
00:03:59,039 --> 00:03:59,969
- Do you like it?

121
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:00,802
- [Joel] It's awesome.

122
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:02,264
- New year, new shirt.

123
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:04,368
And to everyone who doesn't like it,

124
00:04:04,368 --> 00:04:05,772
you know what I have to say to them?

125
00:04:05,772 --> 00:04:06,605

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,373
- [Ellie] Come hug him.

129
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:13,373
- [Jared] Are you guys
giving each other hugs?

130
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:14,965
- No Calvin's being a stinker.

131
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:16,678
Look, hug Lincoln.

132
00:04:16,678 --> 00:04:19,555
- Hugs, awww.
- Hug so nice.

133
00:04:19,555 --> 00:04:21,027
(Jared laughs)

134
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,465
- These two are some of
the most entertaining,

135
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,205
some of the most ferocious kids

136
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:27,197
I've ever seen.

137
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,718
They love each other,
they hate each other,

138
00:04:28,718 --> 00:04:30,230
they love each other,
they hate each other.

139
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:31,574
They love each other,

140
00:04:31,574 --> 00:04:32,943
and then what do you think happens?

141
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:34,687
No, they mutually respect each other,

142
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,823
then they hate each other,
that's what happens.

143
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:39,020
It's a cyclical pattern
that they're going through.

144
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,932
- I don't want you guys to fall forward

145
00:04:39,932 --> 00:04:42,143
and hit your teeth.

146
00:04:42,143 --> 00:04:43,079
- [Jared] That would be so bad.

147
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,119
- Like that.

148
00:04:44,119 --> 00:04:45,317
- [Jared] There you go.

149
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:47,421
Duck duck goose.

150
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:48,254
- Wait, just kidding.

151
00:04:48,254 --> 00:04:50,763
- [Jared] That's a bad example, Mom.

152
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:51,596
- No more, stop.

153
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:55,179
- [Jared] How about
yeah yeah, there we go.

154
00:04:57,502 --> 00:04:59,160
(Jared laughing)

155
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,443
(boys laughing)

156
00:05:00,443 --> 00:05:01,969
- [Ellie] Laughing in the new year.

157
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:02,802
- [Jared] Yay!

158
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,635
New year, new babies.

159
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:07,216
Wait a second, new year, new baby.

160
00:05:07,216 --> 00:05:08,776
- See who wins.

161
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,519
Jared's gonna play Mario--

162
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,352
- Is that a challenge?

163
00:05:12,352 --> 00:05:14,062
- with Cody.
- Are you challenging me?

164
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:15,530
- Oh yeah, did you grow up with one?

165
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,612
- Oh well yeah, but it was on its way out

166
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:20,667
when I was a kid.

167
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,372
- We both grew up with those.

168
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:24,892
We loved 'em, Beau's really good.

169
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:28,334
Cody and Jared and whoever loses first,

170
00:05:28,334 --> 00:05:29,916
I get to play with, okay?

171
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:31,792
- New year, new challenge.

172
00:05:31,792 --> 00:05:32,734
- So I want to give you guys

173
00:05:32,734 --> 00:05:34,903
a quick little baby update.

174
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:37,579
So I told you guys quite a while ago,

175
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,296
that I'm pretty sure I felt the baby,

176
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:40,445
definitely know what it feels like

177
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:41,278
with the other two pregnancies.

178
00:05:41,278 --> 00:05:43,123
I totally have felt flutters,

179
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,050
but last night was the first night,

180
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,322
at midnight or at one
o'clock, it was at 1:00 AM,

181
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:51,802
I was sitting there and I was like,

182
00:05:51,802 --> 00:05:52,842
that was the baby.

183
00:05:52,842 --> 00:05:54,209
It wasn't just like a flutter,

184
00:05:54,209 --> 00:05:56,890
I felt like a full blown on my left side,

185
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,458
totally movement, like that was the baby

186
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,617
and then today I have felt a few flutters

187
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,960
and I'm like oh my gosh so,

188
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,485
14 weeks, 14 and a half weeks,

189
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:10,485
feeling the baby, it's awesome.

190
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,020
Cody's going first, you're
doing good Code boy.

191
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,853
- He's already kicking my butt

192
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:14,984
and I haven't even started playing.

193
00:06:14,984 --> 00:06:16,985
- [Ellie] This is awesome.

194
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,129
Hi Cal.

195
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,225
Let's see what the other kids are doing.

196
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,553
As you can tell,

197
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,778
today we are just,

198
00:06:22,778 --> 00:06:24,410
this is what we're doing all day.

199
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,172
We're going room to room.

200
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:28,579
You're playing, you guys
got superpowers, huh?

201
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:29,830
What?
- Uh-huh.

202
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,960
- [Ellie] Okay, be careful.

203
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
- [Jackson] Watch this.

204
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,543
- [Ellie] Oh, here I'll get it.

205
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,623
You guys are just throwing
the hats back and forth?

206
00:06:39,623 --> 00:06:40,456
- Mmm-hmm.

207
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:41,603
- Okay.

208
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,595
Oh that's good.

209
00:06:43,595 --> 00:06:44,998
- [Jared] Cody's giving you
all the instructions Ellie.

210
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,483
- I know.

211
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:47,432
- [Jared] You're like
oh I don't need to know,

212
00:06:47,432 --> 00:06:49,192
I know where all the mushrooms are.

213
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:50,356
- I'll tell you a secret on it.

214
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:52,064
- [Jared] Ooh, I love a secret.

215
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:54,031
- I know a secret.

216
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:56,415
- Every time we play a video game,

217
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,859
Ellie's just like, I just
want to play original Mario.

218
00:06:58,859 --> 00:06:59,692
- Yeah.

219
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:00,525
- That's all I want to do.

220
00:07:00,525 --> 00:07:02,232
- Everybody's like, you
want to play a game with me,

221
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,251
well they're kind of
lame to be, unless it's--

222
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,758
- [Jared] Mario?

223
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,540
(yelling)

224
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,659
- Unless it's--

225
00:07:09,659 --> 00:07:12,550
- You don't get the secret because

226
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,495
you can't break anymore.

227
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:18,162
- Okay, it was Mario
64 is a really fun one.

228
00:07:20,377 --> 00:07:22,232
And the classic, this one.
- That's a really fun one.

229
00:07:22,232 --> 00:07:23,456
- If you like Mario 64,

230
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:25,594
I think you'll really
like Super Mario Odyssey.

231
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:29,084
Super Mario Odyssey is like
one of my favorite games ever.

232
00:07:29,084 --> 00:07:30,673
- Have I seen you play that?

233
00:07:30,673 --> 00:07:32,041
- Yeah I think so, yeah.

234
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:33,604
Okay, I said it before,

235
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:34,963
but the Nintendo Switch is honestly

236
00:07:34,963 --> 00:07:36,539
one of my favorite consoles,

237
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,372
because it's just like--

238
00:07:37,372 --> 00:07:38,529
- [Ellie] Yeah, even Jackson loves it.

239
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:41,281
- I don't have to put
gaming into my schedule,

240
00:07:41,281 --> 00:07:44,031
it can go with me, wherever I go,

241
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:47,159
so that's pretty fun.

242
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,185
And Breath of the Wild,
probably that, the Last of Us

243
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:52,415
and Final Fantasy VII

244
00:07:52,415 --> 00:07:55,667
are probably my three top
favorite games of all time.

245
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,553
- What's the one I bought for you

246
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:57,386
when we were in college?

247
00:07:57,386 --> 00:07:58,219
- [Jared] The Last of Us.

248
00:07:58,219 --> 00:07:59,845
- Yeah it was right after
Jared had graduated.

249
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,085
I was doing grocery shopping

250
00:08:01,085 --> 00:08:03,395
and I knew he had wanted it for so long,

251
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,851
and I came home and I
surprised him with it.

252
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:08,099
- And that was one of the
most genuine surprises

253
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:09,202
I've ever had.

254
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:10,106
- [Ellie] He was so happy.

255
00:08:10,106 --> 00:08:12,226
- I had no idea she was
even going to do it.

256
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,713
We couldn't afford a video game.

257
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:16,217
Like $60 bucks, we couldn't afford one.

258
00:08:16,217 --> 00:08:17,808
- [Ellie] Right out of college.

259
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:21,744
- Yeah and there it was
when I walked in the door,

260
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,014
and it was just like the coolest thing.

261
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:25,262
I think I stayed up all night playing it.

262
00:08:25,262 --> 00:08:26,616
It was so much fun.

263
00:08:26,616 --> 00:08:27,528
Those are fun memories.

264
00:08:27,528 --> 00:08:29,337
- I love it.

265
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:31,650
And I love this even more.

266
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,111
Let's see how long this lasts, oh!

267
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,498
(laughing)

268
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:35,991
(yells)

269
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:38,459
- Don't rage quit.
- Oh, uh-uh.

270
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,293
- [Ellie] Don't.

271
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:40,510
- Hey, we don't do that
to other peoples' toys.

272
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,598
- [Ellie] You probably
didn't have to laugh,

273
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,847
but I think even you laughed.

274
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:45,597
- I don't like dying.

275
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:47,721
- Me either.
- I know, dying is not fun.

276
00:08:47,721 --> 00:08:50,610
- [Ellie] Okay, Cody's turn.

277
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,089
- I want to be on a different level.

278
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,299
- Okay, Dad's gonna help you.
- Okay, we'll get better.

279
00:08:55,299 --> 00:08:56,806
- We'll start with the easier one.

280
00:08:56,806 --> 00:08:58,338
- You just are learning how to play stuff,

281
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,206
so it's kind of hard sometimes, huh?

282
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,310
Look at Mom though.

283
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,872
We don't want to hurt Cody's toy,

284
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:05,625
so don't throw it, okay?

285
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:07,003
- Let's be honest, we've all been there

286
00:09:07,003 --> 00:09:08,054
playing video games.

287
00:09:08,054 --> 00:09:09,342
You just want to throw the controls down.

288
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,430
- I used to bend the remote.

289
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,073
Like we'd get so mad, we'd bend it.

290
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:18,652
Or I'd get so mad, I would
throw it at Julie's forehead

291
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:20,116
and leave a dent in her forehead.

292
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:23,257
- Oh geez, such love.
- Don't do that Jacks.

293
00:09:23,257 --> 00:09:26,024
- And this is the babies' games.

294
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:26,857
I shouldn't even call you babies anymore.

295
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:30,769
What did you just say
when you jumped Calvin?

296
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,102
- One two baby a back baby--

297
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,300
- [Ellie] He counts to three.

298
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,684
- Baby!

299
00:09:38,684 --> 00:09:39,934
- [Jared] Baby!

300
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:42,318
- Mommy.

301
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,337
- [Ellie] All of you kids,
what are your new year goals?

302
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:48,173
- [Jared] Everyone, look at the sun.

303
00:09:48,173 --> 00:09:50,112
- [Bonnie] Where's the
sun, look in the sun.

304
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:50,945
That's what we do.

305
00:09:50,945 --> 00:09:51,778
- Don't point to it, look at it.

306
00:09:51,778 --> 00:09:52,736
- It's good for you.

307
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:53,569
Look at the sun.

308
00:09:53,569 --> 00:09:54,402
- [Jared] We did it on the eclipse day,

309
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:56,019
we're gonna do it again.

310
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,202
- [Ellie] Are you
excited for the new year?

311
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:59,035
- Yeah.

312
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,033
- [Ellie] What's your goal?

313
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,792
To be five?
- To be five, to turn five.

314
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:02,771
- [Ellie] That'd be cool.

315
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,355
- [Bonnie] Well that's a
good achievable goal, honey.

316
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:05,226
- [Ellie] Four?

317
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:07,801
Okay, I think you could turn four.

318
00:10:07,801 --> 00:10:10,823
This is pretty, we're going
on a little walk tonight.

319
00:10:10,823 --> 00:10:12,626
That is the rolls.
- And the veggie.

320
00:10:12,626 --> 00:10:15,376
- So round two of the party time.

321
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,319
So this is what's going on.

322
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,351
We had dinner takeout and we went

323
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:23,332
to this amazing place called Benja's

324
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,722
and actually I've been there before

325
00:10:24,722 --> 00:10:26,304
when we were filming
with Geekafies down here

326
00:10:26,304 --> 00:10:30,816
in St. George, Geekify Guys,
and it was really great.

327
00:10:30,816 --> 00:10:32,727
So Carl and Jinger were like,

328
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:33,560
let's do this again,

329
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,968
and we're like, okay perfect.

330
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,615
So we each got a meal,

331
00:10:36,615 --> 00:10:38,091
and when we got there,

332
00:10:38,091 --> 00:10:39,457
they're like oh you guys are the ones

333
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:40,832
who ordered all the food.

334
00:10:40,832 --> 00:10:43,207
And we're like yeah, I guess that's us,

335
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,307
the name is Jared, under Jared,

336
00:10:45,307 --> 00:10:46,881
and they're like okay, yeah perfect.

337
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,479
- Six meals is the law, I guess.

338
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,260
- Yeah and we're like okay whatever.

339
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,623
And then another lady was like

340
00:10:51,623 --> 00:10:52,737
have you guys been helped yet,

341
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,681
is everything okay?

342
00:10:53,681 --> 00:10:56,345
And we're like yeah, we're
waiting for an order for Jared.

343
00:10:56,345 --> 00:10:57,673
Oh you guys are the ones that ordered

344
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:58,625
a lot of food,

345
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,490
and I'm like, I mean guess,

346
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,089
I mean it's a pretty normal amount,

347
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:04,761
there's three of us here,

348
00:11:04,761 --> 00:11:08,673
we have three spouses
at home, no big deal.

349
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:11,417
And then the waitress is like,

350
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:13,657
we done goofed, we goofed up guys,

351
00:11:13,657 --> 00:11:15,833
but don't worry, it's benefiting you.

352
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,666
I'm like what's going on,

353
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:20,021
they're like, we ordered
double of everything

354
00:11:20,021 --> 00:11:21,318
but we're not charging you for it,

355
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:23,998
so we have twice the amount of food.

356
00:11:23,998 --> 00:11:25,268
- She charged for the
regular food though, right?

357
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,555
- Yeah, yeah.

358
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,276
We almost tried walking out

359
00:11:28,276 --> 00:11:30,193
to see if we could get two for none.

360
00:11:30,193 --> 00:11:31,531
No I'm kidding.

361
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,834
But we got twice the amount of food,

362
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,234
so we're gonna have
twice the amount of fun

363
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,808
and twice the amount of poops.

364
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:37,059
Okay, deal?

365
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:38,843
- Yeah!
- Hands in everyone.

366
00:11:38,843 --> 00:11:40,091
- We can't leave the table
'til this food is gone.

367
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:41,009
(laughing)

368
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:43,827
- Boy I have no idea
where the evening went.

369
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:45,523
Everyone went to bed,

370
00:11:45,523 --> 00:11:46,699
and Carl and Jinger left.

371
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:48,363
It was so good to see them

372
00:11:48,363 --> 00:11:49,908
and tomorrow we leave.

373
00:11:49,908 --> 00:11:53,475
But today was the very first day of 2018

374
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:55,987
and we did what our
favorite thing to do is,

375
00:11:55,987 --> 00:11:57,459
is be with family and friends

376
00:11:57,459 --> 00:11:59,907
and just enjoy each other's company.

377
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:03,397
And I imagine we'll do
that quite a bit this year.

378
00:12:03,397 --> 00:12:04,876
But not only that.

379
00:12:04,876 --> 00:12:08,283
I think there's some big
stuff coming this year in 2018

380
00:12:08,283 --> 00:12:10,268
and I can't wait for you to see it

381
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,750
and be a part of it.

382
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,771
So with that, we're gonna call it a night.

383
00:12:13,771 --> 00:12:16,439
We just sat around here,
talked about YouTube.

384
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,815
(laughs)

385
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:19,424
And talked about our kids

386
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:20,896
and it was a lot of fun.

387
00:12:20,896 --> 00:12:22,680
So thank you guys so much for watching.

388
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,513
