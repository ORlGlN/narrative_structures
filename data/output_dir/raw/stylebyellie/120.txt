1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,757
(jingle)

2
00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:04,305
- [Videographer] Happy
Thanksgiving everyone!

3
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,164
(laughter)

4
00:00:05,164 --> 00:00:06,448
Go get it!

5
00:00:06,448 --> 00:00:07,281
Catch it!

6
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:09,515
Yeah!

7
00:00:10,812 --> 00:00:12,315
(everyone chattering)

8
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:15,148
- [Girl] Kevin gets to say prayer.

9
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:18,357
- Wow, wee! Wee!

10
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:22,891
- Are you silly? Uh huh?

11
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:24,210
- [Videographer] Why are you so silly?

12
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,708
- We are, he's getting dressed.

13
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,203
He's like help, I'm so cold.

14
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:28,317
Let's, I have an idea.

15
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:30,811
Let's keep you warm
while we get you dressed.

16
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:31,682
(chuckles)

17
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,705
So now that your arms are in the blanket--

18
00:00:34,705 --> 00:00:36,099
- [Videographer] You gotta be quick, mom!

19
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:40,167
- Let's put your head in, now
let's do your arm, one arm--

20
00:00:40,167 --> 00:00:41,281
- [Videographer] Just one!

21
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,106
Get it! Quick, quick, quick, quick!

22
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:44,305
- And usually Jackson
gets dressed everyday,

23
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:47,446
so that gives me an excuse to help him

24
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:48,521
- [Videographer] Did I tell
you that he got himself

25
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,459
dressed, yesterday?

26
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:50,984
- I know, and everyday.

27
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,240
Almost everyday he gets
himself dressed, huh?

28
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,853
But, don't forget your underwear!

29
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:57,653
- That's happened one time (chuckles).

30
00:00:57,653 --> 00:00:59,869
Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

31
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:02,321
- Happy Thanksgiving!

32
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,108
- Happy Thanksgiving!

33
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:07,064
- Hey, hey, what's under here?

34
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:09,054
- [Videographer] Go in your
tunnel, happy Thanksgiving!

35
00:01:09,054 --> 00:01:13,007
- [Mom] Mr. Calvin, Jackson
wore this shirt last year.

36
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:17,376
Can you believe it fits you (laughter)?

37
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,927
Is there something on your lip?

38
00:01:19,927 --> 00:01:23,470
Okay, look at you handsome buddy!

39
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,595
Jackson, let's see you!

40
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:28,058
Wow, you guys clean up nice!

41
00:01:28,058 --> 00:01:30,160
Can you stand by Jax, Cal?

42
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,743
Let's see yah! Wow!

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,710
Are you guys gonna be good today?

44
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,769
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

45
00:01:35,769 --> 00:01:36,602
- [Mom] It's Thanksgiving!

46
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:37,652
- Yeah!

47
00:01:37,652 --> 00:01:39,024
- [Mom] Do you know what Thanksgiving is?

48
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:39,857
- Yeah.

49
00:01:39,857 --> 00:01:40,690
- [Mom] What?

50
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,523
- Giving!

51
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:42,356
- It's about giving?

52
00:01:42,356 --> 00:01:43,189
- Yeah.

53
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,341
- [Mom] Remember, we're
gonna be a family today?

54
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,724
And we're gonna say
what we're thankful for.

55
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:48,103
We're gonna pick our noses.

56
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,695
- Why are we gonna pick noses?
(giggles)

57
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:53,683
- [Mom] We're gonna wash our hands.

58
00:01:53,683 --> 00:01:55,467
We're gonna have a lot of fun, okay?

59
00:01:55,467 --> 00:01:58,141
We'll play in grandma
and grandpa's backyard.

60
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,397
Play with the football, and
the tramp, and the swing,

61
00:02:00,397 --> 00:02:02,321
and the playhouse, with our cousins.

62
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:03,914
- No, our tree house.

63
00:02:03,914 --> 00:02:05,020
- [Mom] And the tree house.

64
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,402
What are you wanting to do?

65
00:02:06,402 --> 00:02:08,166
- Trying to do my letter book.

66
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,181
- [Mom] Your letter book?

67
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:10,014
- Yeah.

68
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,298
- Aw, that made me so happy!

69
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,630
We're getting ready to
go down to the galley

70
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,515
for Thanksgiving.

71
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,503
Jared's getting ready, we're
getting everyone and Penny

72
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:17,432
packed up.

73
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:20,159
Here's your letter
book, you want a marker.

74
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,689
- I marker too.

75
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:22,686
- [Mom] You wanna color too?

76
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:24,304
- Yeah.
- Come here. Jump on down.

77
00:02:24,304 --> 00:02:25,590
- Blue.

78
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,742
- [Mom] You want blue?

79
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:29,254
- No, Mommy boo.
(giggles)

80
00:02:29,254 --> 00:02:31,147
- [Mom] You're so cute!

81
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:33,658
Um, here, we'll play with this.

82
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:35,807
I have a coloring sheet and
a Bingo page that I found

83
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:39,040
on Pinterest, that I want to print out.

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,835
But while dad's getting
everything ready, we're gonna

85
00:02:41,835 --> 00:02:45,764
sit here, and he wants
to do his letter book,

86
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:47,673
and we are gonna color.

87
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:51,840
- Bounce, counce, poo poo,
poo poo one more time...

88
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,351
- [Mom] Is that the poo poo song?

89
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,184
- Yeah.

90
00:02:59,184 --> 00:03:00,619
- [Mom] Wow!

91
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:02,593
- I'm gonna do the stink song.

92
00:03:02,593 --> 00:03:04,926
- [Mom] Okay, let's hear it.

93
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:07,705
- Stink stink butt butt.

94
00:03:07,705 --> 00:03:09,302
- [Mom] Awe!

95
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:11,027
- No, not the live
turkey, the dead turkey.

96
00:03:11,027 --> 00:03:14,527
- The cooked turkey, the delicious turkey.

97
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:17,036
(chuckles) Happy Thanksgiving everyone!

98
00:03:17,036 --> 00:03:20,001
(laughter)

99
00:03:20,001 --> 00:03:22,243
I thought when we played that
the other day, I was like,

100
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,413
oh there's a live turkey
and a cooked turkey,

101
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:25,318
how do we explain this?

102
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:27,568
(laughter)

103
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:30,632
- Okay, let's do the green
leaf and the yellow leaf.

104
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:31,665
- Bingo! Bingo!

105
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,002
- What?

106
00:03:33,002 --> 00:03:36,000
- Olivia with the first Bingo
of the Thanksgiving Dinner

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,563
celebration!
(other kids screaming)

108
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:39,146
- Good girl!

109
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:41,176
- All have blackout,
this is out second round.

110
00:03:41,176 --> 00:03:42,500
- [Dad] Oh my gosh.

111
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,333
- We'll keep going.

112
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,335
- [Dad] Did you guys eat
all the goldfish too once

113
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:45,168
you got a blackout?

114
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:46,271
- [Kids] No, no!

115
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,273
- That's my favorite part of the game.

116
00:03:47,273 --> 00:03:48,410
- [Kids] I did, I did, me!

117
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:51,180
- [Dad] Russel knows how
to play, and Cody knows how

118
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,089
to play.

119
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:53,975
We just got to Ellie's parent's
house for the Thanksgiving

120
00:03:53,975 --> 00:03:57,068
Day Celebration and we have
our, the family's kind of

121
00:03:57,068 --> 00:03:58,702
divided up into different quadrants.

122
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:00,522
We've got the kids playing Bingo.

123
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:03,017
We've got some of the
guys watching Football.

124
00:04:03,017 --> 00:04:06,810
We've got the table over
here, and where the magic

125
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,560
happens, grandma and grandpa with

126
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:13,691
all the turkey.
- It's Penny!

127
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,082
- [Dad] Lincoln, do you see Penny?

128
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,165
- He outside.

129
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:21,249
- Oh fun! Yes we brought Penny, along.

130
00:04:21,249 --> 00:04:22,082
- Where's Penny?

131
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:24,368
- [Dad] Do you want to go say hi to Penny?

132
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:26,118
- There, I see Penny!

133
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:30,401
- Penny is just dying over
this new ball, she loves it.

134
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,121
I think that's the win from
her anniversary celebration.

135
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,114
Lincoln and I wanted to
come out and see Penny,

136
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:37,479
and throw the ball for her.

137
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:38,582
Do you want to throw the ball for her?

138
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:42,582
Yeah, if she'll let it up,
we can throw it for her.

139
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,464
That's the hardest part of
the game, is getting the ball

140
00:04:44,464 --> 00:04:45,486
from the dog.

141
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,361
She's got one side of fetch
down, but the other half,

142
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:53,321
you know, giving it back,
that's the difficult part.

143
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:55,749
Oh, you're so fast, Penny!

144
00:04:55,749 --> 00:04:57,017
Guys, we got the ball, we got the ball!

145
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,753
Let's throw it for her!

146
00:04:58,753 --> 00:05:00,695
Ready Penny? Ready?

147
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:01,528
Go get it!

148
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:03,704
- Is that her favorite ball?

149
00:05:03,704 --> 00:05:05,199
- [Dad] I think that's
her new favorite ball!

150
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,866
Yay, okay! Catch it!

151
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,485
Yeah (laughter)!

152
00:05:12,485 --> 00:05:14,574
I try to pretend to be!

153
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:18,917
- You're not pretending
Ellie, this is you.

154
00:05:18,917 --> 00:05:21,070
He wants to throw it?

155
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,955
- Okay, throw it to mom?

156
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:22,919
Come on throw it to me, I'll catch it!

157
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,444
- [Dad] He's running down
the pipe, he's going down the

158
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:26,177
field, he dodges, he
tackles left and right,

159
00:05:26,177 --> 00:05:28,882
what's he gonna do? He's gonna
pass the 20, the 10, the 5!

160
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:30,240
Can he make it all the way?

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,250
- Throw it, hurry, I'll catch it!

162
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,083
Throw it!

163
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,672
- [Dad] Lateral, yeah!

164
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:35,755
Oh, so close.

165
00:05:38,642 --> 00:05:41,965
- [Mom] Do you have a name tag?

166
00:05:41,965 --> 00:05:45,882
Okay, Jackson, Cody,
Russel, and this is Calvin

167
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,336
and Lincoln right here.

168
00:05:49,336 --> 00:05:50,948
That's where mom used to have to sit.

169
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,286
- I'm putting Porter
up here too he's good.

170
00:05:52,286 --> 00:05:53,686
- [Mom] Good! Good!

171
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,156
So usually how this works
is the kids will eat,

172
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,099
and then go off and play.

173
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,004
The adults will sit and
eat and end up talking

174
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:03,142
for a long time.

175
00:06:03,142 --> 00:06:04,770
Where are you gonna sit?

176
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,937
You know what, Aunt Linda?

177
00:06:08,505 --> 00:06:10,130
Right here, mom.

178
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,786
Yeah, yep, this is where I
figured you might want to sit.

179
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:14,733
Want me to pull it out?

180
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:16,170
- [Aunt Linda] Yeah!

181
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,385
(silence - audio missing)

182
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:22,781
- I think this might be our
first year with three tables.

183
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:25,438
Last time we had more than
three tables, was when all

184
00:06:25,438 --> 00:06:27,849
my aunts and uncles and cousins came.

185
00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:31,089
Baby, baby table right there
for moving all the kids,

186
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:34,152
middle kids right here, grown ups there.

187
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:35,552
- [Videographer] Stop
hitting, don't you hit.

188
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:37,598
Stop hitting, don't you know
you're suppose to be really

189
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,288
nice and respectful and happy?

190
00:06:39,288 --> 00:06:40,675
You stop, you grr...

191
00:06:40,675 --> 00:06:42,829
(laughter)

192
00:06:42,829 --> 00:06:44,688
Did you just feed Penny?

193
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,461
- Yeah, we have her some turkey dinner.

194
00:06:46,461 --> 00:06:47,532
She's such a good girl.

195
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,903
- [Mom] She looks very happy.

196
00:06:48,903 --> 00:06:50,648
- [Dad] Yeah, hey! Whoa!

197
00:06:50,648 --> 00:06:52,588
A little too happy.

198
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:53,730
- Where's Kevin?

199
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,897
(chatter)

200
00:06:56,789 --> 00:06:57,658
- Digging for gold.

201
00:06:57,658 --> 00:06:59,825
(chatter)

202
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:07,803
- [Mom] Kevin gets to say the prayer.

203
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,168
- Kevin has to say the prayer.

204
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:11,335
(chatter)

205
00:07:13,899 --> 00:07:15,358
- [Male] Yeah, I had a lot of
people tell me they couldn't--

206
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,429
- He's just waiting--

207
00:07:16,429 --> 00:07:17,374
- [Mom] To play?

208
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:18,266
- Yeah, to play.

209
00:07:18,266 --> 00:07:20,499
Look at his cousins.

210
00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:22,666
(snoring)

211
00:07:34,608 --> 00:07:36,962
- [Mom] He literally
laid day two seconds ago.

212
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:40,954
(giggles)
What the heck?

213
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:43,003
(laughter) Is he being silly, Aunt Linda?

214
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,211
She is so happy right now!

215
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:45,266
- [Dad] Oh, she is loving life right now!

216
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:46,808
Throw it Jackson!

217
00:07:46,808 --> 00:07:49,227
- [Mom] Unlimited amount of balls.

218
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:52,394
- Let's go, let's go!
- [Kids] Hey Jax!

219
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,652
- [Mom] Are you playing
Thanksgiving football?

220
00:07:58,652 --> 00:07:59,485
- Yeah.

221
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:01,668
- Yeah, we all are!

222
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:02,501
- [Mom] Penny will get it!

223
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,252
She's so fast.

224
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:08,419
(chatter and kids yelling)
(laughter)

225
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,557
- Who!

226
00:08:21,612 --> 00:08:25,299
- [Mom] Penny, we're
gonna wear you out girl!

227
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:28,295
- There's no stick, I'm smarter!

228
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:29,640
- You are!

229
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,687
(laughter)

230
00:08:30,687 --> 00:08:32,058
- At least my kid agrees with me.

231
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,499
Everyone else in the world may not.

232
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,417
- It's fun!

233
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:37,893
This is fun!

234
00:08:39,034 --> 00:08:40,762
- Are you hiding the ball from Penny?

235
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:41,596
- Yeah!

236
00:08:45,051 --> 00:08:46,655
- Wanna go play Football?

237
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:47,790
- Uh-huh!

238
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,873
- Just watch!

239
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:54,746
- (singing) Wee! Wow! Wee! Wee!

240
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,045
Our ball, the ball!

241
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:04,878
Wee! Wee!

242
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,208
- Mom likes baby!

243
00:09:08,208 --> 00:09:09,212
(rawrs)

244
00:09:09,212 --> 00:09:11,514
No, be nice. Look, be nice.

245
00:09:11,514 --> 00:09:13,973
Say mama, you're gonna make me cry.

246
00:09:13,973 --> 00:09:15,648
- Oh, mommy.

247
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:16,481
Nice baby.

248
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:18,936
- Say mama's baby.

249
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,186
- Mommy's baby!

250
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,943
- He always pets my face,
guys, and goes mama's baby!

251
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:26,774
You are my baby!

252
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,224
And so is Jackson!
(yelling in background)

253
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:30,761
You did, you caught it?

254
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:31,594
- Yep!

255
00:09:31,594 --> 00:09:32,887
- Okay, let's see you throw it!

256
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:34,486
- [Background Voice] Jackson!

257
00:09:34,486 --> 00:09:35,819
- [Mom] Woo hoo!

258
00:09:37,302 --> 00:09:39,687
And Penny's my baby!

259
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:41,614
(laughter) she's so tired.

260
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,104
- [Kid in Lap] Mommy's baby.

261
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:44,458
- [Dad] Alright, here's
what I want you to do.

262
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,865
K, you're gonna line up to
my right, okay, once you get

263
00:09:46,865 --> 00:09:48,599
to the trampoline, you're
gonna do a diagonal

264
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:49,465
to the fence.

265
00:09:49,465 --> 00:09:50,684
That's the play, okay?

266
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:51,539
It's called a slant.

267
00:09:51,539 --> 00:09:52,744
- Hurry, Penny's not watching.

268
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:54,292
Go, go, go!

269
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,632
- [Dad] Go, go, go!

270
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:56,465
- No!

271
00:09:56,465 --> 00:09:59,318
- [Dad] Oh! The defense
was there, but the offense

272
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:01,744
was no where to be found.

273
00:10:01,744 --> 00:10:03,402
Okay, let's run that play again, mom.

274
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,735
- Just throw it!

275
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:07,190
- [Dad] Yay! Mom!

276
00:10:08,925 --> 00:10:09,758
- I think I can--

277
00:10:09,758 --> 00:10:11,122
- She's so tired, she's not trying.

278
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:12,679
(chuckles)

279
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,518
- [Dad] Are you tired?

280
00:10:14,518 --> 00:10:15,800
Are you just gonna sit there in place?

281
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,897
She's oh gees.

282
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,513
I can't keep up anymore.

283
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:19,863
Oh man.

284
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:20,734
- Are you having a good day?

285
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:21,567
- Yeah.

286
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,400
- [Dad] Good!

287
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,545
You're getting a little close!

288
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:25,932
- Jax acted perfect at dinner.

289
00:10:25,932 --> 00:10:27,544
He's like Thanksgiving's my favorite.

290
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,690
We get together for Christmas,
but, there's something

291
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,245
special about today, because
we're getting together

292
00:10:33,245 --> 00:10:34,435
just to see each other.

293
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,268
- [Dad] Just family.

294
00:10:35,268 --> 00:10:36,113
That's all that's here.

295
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:38,566
- No other distractions.
- Distractions.

296
00:10:38,566 --> 00:10:41,356
- This is fun, just hanging out.

297
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:44,257
- [Dad] Dad said it best.

298
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:45,174
Penny come.

299
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:51,332
- [Mom] Come out here!

300
00:10:53,434 --> 00:10:55,684
Get out here, stop talking!

301
00:10:57,051 --> 00:11:00,077
I can see you talking, you're ignoring me.

302
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:04,055
They're all sitting in
the window just looking.

303
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:05,138
Get out here!

304
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:08,031
- Well it only took an open
swing to convince you guys

305
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:10,386
to come out here and
move the party over here.

306
00:11:10,386 --> 00:11:12,067
Watch out, oh gees!

307
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,900
Emma's double trouble.

308
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:16,222
You guys having fun?

309
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:17,502
Having a happy Thanksgiving?

310
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:18,739
- I am!

311
00:11:18,739 --> 00:11:20,173
- [Dad] You are?

312
00:11:20,173 --> 00:11:21,006
- I'm not.

313
00:11:21,006 --> 00:11:21,839
- [Dad] Awe.

314
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,662
Well we should probably fix that somehow.

315
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:26,031
Penny! (laughter)

316
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,035
Let's try again!

317
00:11:27,035 --> 00:11:29,152
Good throw, ready?

318
00:11:29,152 --> 00:11:30,223
Hold your arms out?

319
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,837
Yeah! You caught it!

320
00:11:31,837 --> 00:11:33,317
Good job, bud!

321
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,178
Go deep.

322
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,436
- [Mom] He's like, what?

323
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:37,686
(chuckles)

324
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,123
- [Dad] Um, Penny was, what the?

325
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,069
Where's Penny?

326
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:46,590
How did she get out?

327
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,170
Penny! Come here! Come here!

328
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,605
- [Teen Girl] The pie is out.

329
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:52,997
- [Dad] Let's go, uh oh.

330
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:54,136
Come on, come on, come on.

331
00:11:54,136 --> 00:11:56,865
That could have been a
Thanksgiving disaster.

332
00:11:56,865 --> 00:11:59,595
Holy cow! I don't know how she got out!

333
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:00,909
But we have all this pie.

334
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:03,077
She definitely has the
incentive to come, break through

335
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:05,001
her little kennel that we have.

336
00:12:05,001 --> 00:12:06,565
Jeepers.

337
00:12:06,565 --> 00:12:09,013
- I was like bad idea, bad idea, grandma!

338
00:12:09,013 --> 00:12:13,698
- [Dad] Don't bring the
pie outside with the dog!

339
00:12:13,698 --> 00:12:15,781
- [Mom] We are on a walk.

340
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,279
The whole fam-bamily.

341
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,112
Except mom and dad.

342
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:20,483
How'd they get out of this?

343
00:12:20,483 --> 00:12:22,722
So we walked to where
this used to be our old

344
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,300
elementary school.

345
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,878
They completely tore it down.

346
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,885
They're making a splash pad.

347
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:29,542
And then that's the new elementary.

348
00:12:29,542 --> 00:12:30,949
And the boys found rocks.

349
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:34,884
- Well, how many people did
we have in this house, today?

350
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:35,717
- Oh dear.

351
00:12:37,126 --> 00:12:38,111
- [Mom] Jackson says five.

352
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:41,275
- [Dad] And now there's
only a few remaining.

353
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:42,363
- Save the best for last.

354
00:12:42,363 --> 00:12:43,780
- [Dad] Oh, snap!

355
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:46,567
- [Grandma] 20 minus 4 here today.

356
00:12:46,567 --> 00:12:47,789
- 25.

357
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:51,022
25 people, and now there's everyone count,

358
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,431
wait, one, two, three, four, five, six,

359
00:12:52,431 --> 00:12:53,981
less than that.

360
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,884
So, (laughter).

361
00:12:55,884 --> 00:12:57,694
So yeah, we're just
wrapping up our day here.

362
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,373
And, having fun a good Thanksgiving.

363
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:01,206
Did you have a good Thanksgiving?

364
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:02,282
I had a great Thanksgiving!

365
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:06,180
Real quick, Jackson, can
you tell me one thing

366
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,384
you're grateful for?

367
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:10,769
- Loading remote controls with cars.

368
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:11,830
- [Dad] Yeah, that's pretty cool.

369
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,954
Joel, what's one thing
you're grateful for.

370
00:13:14,954 --> 00:13:15,787
- Snow.

371
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:16,620
- [Dad] Snow.

372
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,515
Bonnie, what's one thing

373
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:19,080
you're grateful for.
- Oh, that's so hard.

374
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,521
It's cliche, but I am thankful
for my family, so there.

375
00:13:22,521 --> 00:13:23,701
- [Dad] Good, yeah!

376
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:24,761
What's one thing you're thankful for.

377
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:26,256
- Everything.

378
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:27,830
- [Dad] Mom, what's one
thing you're thankful for.

379
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,172
- Okay, it is cliche, but it isn't.

380
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,605
Family is everything, and
I'm grateful that my children

381
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:34,691
get along.

382
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:36,789
- [Dad] Dad, what is one
thing you're grateful for?

383
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,541
- All that they've said,
but I'm really grateful

384
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:40,850
for 50" dirt trails.

385
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,118
- [Dad] Oh!

386
00:13:42,118 --> 00:13:43,710
Olivia, what's one thing
you're grateful for.

387
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,659
- Family.

388
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,531
- [Dad] Awe!

389
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:49,281
Calvin, what's one thing
you're thankful for.

390
00:13:50,613 --> 00:13:52,810
Peppa Pig? Great!

391
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,417
Markers!

392
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:58,250
Lincoln, what's one thing
you're thankful for?

393
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:00,975
- Sharks.

394
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:03,342
- [Dad] Sharks? Okay!

395
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,871
Penny, what's one thing
you're thankful for?

396
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:06,704
Bones!

397
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:10,384
One thing I'm grateful for,
and it's funny because we're

398
00:14:10,384 --> 00:14:14,356
sitting here, with the lights
down dim, and we're sitting

399
00:14:14,356 --> 00:14:17,780
all in the living room and
we're talking, it takes me back

400
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,971
to the very first time I
sat here in this living room

401
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:22,024
after Julian Mannon's wedding.

402
00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,188
And we all sat here and talked.

403
00:14:23,188 --> 00:14:25,999
I wasn't even apart of the
family, but you guys were my ride

404
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,548
to my aunt and uncle's house.

405
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,390
- The couches were like
this that day, too.

406
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,231
- [Dad] Yes, they were.

407
00:14:30,231 --> 00:14:31,588
- [Mom] And me and you were right there.

408
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:35,755
- Uh huh, and I am grateful
that we have the opportunity

409
00:14:37,927 --> 00:14:41,702
and the desire and the conversation.

410
00:14:41,702 --> 00:14:44,875
You know, I like sitting here
and talking with my family.

411
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:47,161
And I'm glad that I'm
apart of this family.

412
00:14:47,161 --> 00:14:48,434
So that's what I am grateful for.

413
00:14:48,434 --> 00:14:50,250
- Yay! We are too!

414
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,354
I feel like I try and
appreciate my family everyday,

415
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:56,055
not just like, just Thanksgiving.

416
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:59,851
But, it was extra
special, you know, it was,

417
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:02,089
just being together.

418
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:05,286
Even though we are together,
even though I do get to see

419
00:15:05,286 --> 00:15:07,549
my siblings, it was extra special.

420
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:10,139
- Yeah, and I mean, it's
not that you aren't grateful

421
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,805
the other days, it's that
you focus on the gratitude,

422
00:15:12,805 --> 00:15:17,199
you know, and you try to
think about all the things

423
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,336
that you're grateful for.

424
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:22,026
Because, really when it comes
down to it, there are so many

425
00:15:22,026 --> 00:15:23,494
things that we're grateful for.

426
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:25,543
And we'd don't always talk
about everything that we're

427
00:15:25,543 --> 00:15:26,396
grateful for.

428
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:28,587
- The biggest thing is
family, because that's like,

429
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:32,135
the only thing that really
matters to me, and us,

430
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:35,551
but, I was telling Jared on
the way home, I was like,

431
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:39,718
I feel like, I everyday try
and make really quality time

432
00:15:40,571 --> 00:15:42,471
with the kids.

433
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:43,806
And it doesn't have to be a whole day.

434
00:15:43,806 --> 00:15:46,794
But I really do try and like,
a good quality time with them.

435
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:50,806
And, Calvin really enjoyed
swinging with me today.

436
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:52,171
Usually he doesn't want that.

437
00:15:52,171 --> 00:15:54,095
He wants to do it himself.

438
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:56,452
But today, I loved sitting
on the swing till my butt

439
00:15:56,452 --> 00:15:58,139
was numb swinging him.

440
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,393
- He just like laid in on you, snuggled--

441
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:02,226
- He was loving on me.

442
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,787
- And he would not let
go of that football.

443
00:16:03,787 --> 00:16:04,859
- No, he won't.

444
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:07,919
And Jackson, he loved playing the game.

445
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,574
He loved bingo.

446
00:16:09,574 --> 00:16:12,028
And then the rest of the
time he wanted nothing to do

447
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,202
with anyone but his
cousins, which was perfect.

448
00:16:14,202 --> 00:16:15,622
You know, he just wanted to play.

449
00:16:15,622 --> 00:16:18,045
- Oh, him and Boston
were loving life today.

450
00:16:18,045 --> 00:16:20,795
- Which is interesting,
because usually him and Boston,

451
00:16:20,795 --> 00:16:21,773
sometimes--

452
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:22,980
- Yeah, they clash a little bit.

453
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,308
- Butt heads.

454
00:16:24,308 --> 00:16:25,495
- And Jackson wants to play with Cody.

455
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:29,401
But, I finally fell like
Jackson and Boston have realized

456
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:30,788
that they're like--

457
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:31,975
- They're friends.

458
00:16:31,975 --> 00:16:32,808
- We can be friends!

459
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:33,822
We like the same things!
- They held hands

460
00:16:33,822 --> 00:16:35,018
on the walk.
- It was so cute.

461
00:16:35,018 --> 00:16:38,062
- I'm grateful for a lot of things.

462
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:41,016
I'm grateful that we were
able to go to another part

463
00:16:41,016 --> 00:16:45,183
of the world, and see how a
whole other part of the world

464
00:16:46,508 --> 00:16:51,325
lives, it makes me grateful
for what I have here.

465
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,809
I'm grateful for what we have.

466
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,450
I'm grateful for my family.

467
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,023
I'm grateful for a roof over our head.

468
00:16:58,023 --> 00:17:01,018
My mom said she was grateful
that our family got together

469
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,943
and spent all day together.

470
00:17:02,943 --> 00:17:04,683
She's like, some families don't have that.

471
00:17:04,683 --> 00:17:06,089
Some families they can't.

472
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,872
Some families, they don't want to.

473
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,169
Or, like, I'm grateful for that.

474
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:14,977
I'm grateful to see my friends
spend time with their family.

475
00:17:14,977 --> 00:17:17,251
- Yeah, like it's fun to have
our family get together and--

476
00:17:17,251 --> 00:17:20,273
- It was enjoyable seeing
my siblings and having pie,

477
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:23,461
and Aunt Linda was the life
of the party, Aunt Linda

478
00:17:23,462 --> 00:17:25,094
we love being with you.

479
00:17:25,094 --> 00:17:26,445
- She was so sweet.

480
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,137
Everyone who walked through
the front door, she was there

481
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:29,970
to greet them.

482
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,411
And she gave them a big hug.

483
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:32,596
She was very tender.

484
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:34,798
She was excited to have a party.

485
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:36,018
It was fun.

486
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:38,225
I mean, there are so many
things I'm grateful for too,

487
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:41,103
and it's while we were in China.

488
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:44,020
So, speaking of China, I'm
gonna make my sermon pretty

489
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,853
quick here.

490
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:49,584
While we were in China, we
met Richie and Natalie Norton.

491
00:17:49,584 --> 00:17:52,969
Natalie was talking about
like, radical gratitude.

492
00:17:52,969 --> 00:17:56,005
Being grateful for some things
that you normally wouldn't

493
00:17:56,005 --> 00:18:00,255
be grateful for, because you
haven't seen what the gratitude

494
00:18:00,255 --> 00:18:01,088
is yet.

495
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:03,443
She lost her phone on the trip,
and she's like, I'm grateful

496
00:18:03,443 --> 00:18:05,766
I lost my phone because I
wouldn't have experienced it

497
00:18:05,766 --> 00:18:07,349
the same way I did.

498
00:18:08,273 --> 00:18:10,473
I would have been too drawn
into my phone, and I would

499
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:12,620
have missed things.

500
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,453
So I want to try and have--

501
00:18:14,453 --> 00:18:16,133
- Takes things and completely spins it.

502
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,537
Who would ever say that?

503
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:19,287
She was sad of course.

504
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:22,147
She was sad she lost pictures,
she was sad, you know

505
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:25,484
it's work to get more
stuff on a new phone,

506
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:29,060
and it's money, but she
really tries and takes every

507
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,315
situation, every situation--

508
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,913
- And finds something to be grateful for.

509
00:18:32,913 --> 00:18:36,915
And I think that's a wonderful
skill to develop, and I'm

510
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:38,346
going to work on developing that skill.

511
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:42,768
I think one thing that is
hard for us, is to be grateful

512
00:18:42,768 --> 00:18:44,175
for the trials that we go through.

513
00:18:44,175 --> 00:18:48,979
Because, while we're going
through them, it's difficult

514
00:18:48,979 --> 00:18:51,807
and it's hard, but when we
are done going through them,

515
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:54,860
and we overcome them, we can
see the lessons we've learned.

516
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,089
So I'm grateful for the
trials that we go through,

517
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:01,493
because of the lessons that we
will learn and have learned.

518
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,470
- And that's with anything, anything.

519
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,766
- I'm grateful that we went
to China, and were able

520
00:19:05,766 --> 00:19:09,090
to experience the culture
because we never have before,

521
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,157
and I thought it was wonderful.

522
00:19:11,157 --> 00:19:13,194
And it made me grateful
for things over in China,

523
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:14,411
and things over in here.

524
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:18,109
I'm grateful for obviously
our family and our kids,

525
00:19:18,109 --> 00:19:19,501
I love them.

526
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:22,115
I'm grateful for the
opportunities that we have here,

527
00:19:22,115 --> 00:19:23,490
right here, talking to you.

528
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,874
I'm grateful for this opportunity.

529
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:26,536
And for everyone.

530
00:19:26,536 --> 00:19:30,130
And I hope we express our
gratitude enough, and I hope you

531
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,756
know the things we are grateful
for, and I hope we talk

532
00:19:32,756 --> 00:19:35,717
about them a lot, because
we are grateful for them.

533
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,407
- Something that Ritchie said too,

534
00:19:37,407 --> 00:19:40,312
that I'll wrap up with is,

535
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:44,431
it was cool to be in China,
to be on the other end

536
00:19:44,431 --> 00:19:47,826
of the world, and they didn't un--

537
00:19:47,826 --> 00:19:50,066
Some people didn't understand
us, and we didn't understand

538
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:54,663
them, but through our phones
we could talk into an app,

539
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:56,662
and it'd translate it to
them, and then they'd talk,

540
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:57,992
and it'd translate it to us.

541
00:19:57,992 --> 00:20:00,545
That was so cool, 'cause
there's nothing different

542
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,128
about us, like, we,

543
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,563
and it was a wonderful
experience to do that.

544
00:20:06,563 --> 00:20:09,399
And see the other person
light up and laugh when like,

545
00:20:09,399 --> 00:20:11,601
we just weren't understanding
each other but we were trying

546
00:20:11,601 --> 00:20:16,125
to, like, it was a different
experience and I loved it.

547
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,152
And I grew from it, and
I'm grateful for it.

548
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:20,373
And we met some wonderful people there.

549
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:22,692
Thank you guys so much for
watching our Thanksgiving

550
00:20:22,692 --> 00:20:26,025
family special, and our boys are in bed.

551
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,545
- Penny is asleep.

552
00:20:28,545 --> 00:20:31,867
She, oh my gosh, if anyone
is grateful for today,

553
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,005
I think Penny was.

554
00:20:33,005 --> 00:20:36,742
- She unlimited amount of
hands on her back rubbing her.

555
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:37,575
She loved it.

556
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:38,408
- She was the best.

557
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,241
- Thanks guys.

558
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:42,031
- We'll see you tomorrow, bye!

559
00:20:42,031 --> 00:20:42,948
I love you.

560
00:20:44,184 --> 00:20:45,421
- Gotta get some rest.

561
00:20:45,421 --> 00:00:00,000
- Let's go to sleep!
