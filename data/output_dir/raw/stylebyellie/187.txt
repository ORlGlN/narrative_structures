1
00:00:00,385 --> 00:00:02,304
- [Man] Penny!

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,725
Jackson, you have a beard!

3
00:00:03,725 --> 00:00:05,559
Calvin, you have one too.

4
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:06,791
Arggh matey!

5
00:00:06,791 --> 00:00:07,999
The name's bubble beard.

6
00:00:07,999 --> 00:00:11,393
Arggh, it's bubble beard's wife.

7
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:12,735
- [Woman] Bonnie has a lot of make-up.

8
00:00:12,735 --> 00:00:14,090
I know she has nude lipstick.

9
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,948
I'm going to sneak in her house
and see if I can find one.

10
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:20,115
Okay, hold on.

11
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:25,755
- [Man] Alright, push the
button, you can do it.

12
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:27,284
Good job.

13
00:00:27,284 --> 00:00:28,509
- No, no, no, no.

14
00:00:28,509 --> 00:00:30,093
- [Man] No, no, no, no.

15
00:00:30,093 --> 00:00:31,549
- Nee, ne, ne, ne.

16
00:00:31,549 --> 00:00:33,152
- [Man] No, nee, no, new.

17
00:00:33,152 --> 00:00:35,181
- New, new, nah, nah.

18
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,047
(laughter) (gasp)

19
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:37,361
- [Man] There's our door.

20
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:38,594
Can you find the star?

21
00:00:38,594 --> 00:00:39,427
- Star.

22
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:40,260
- [Man] There it is.

23
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,093
Good job.

24
00:00:41,093 --> 00:00:42,383
Okay, Calvin, your job for the day

25
00:00:42,383 --> 00:00:44,381
is to hold all of the
tickets and don't lose them.

26
00:00:44,381 --> 00:00:45,214
Okay?

27
00:00:45,214 --> 00:00:46,389
That's how we get on the plane.

28
00:00:46,389 --> 00:00:48,620
Can you do that for us?

29
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,932
- He is so tired.

30
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:50,765
- (laughter) Good job.

31
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:51,598
Alright.

32
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:52,480
Kay, I think we'll make it.

33
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,362
I don't think we'll lose the tickets.

34
00:00:53,362 --> 00:00:54,999
We've got a good man on the job.

35
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,527
Clearly knows what he's doing.

36
00:00:56,527 --> 00:00:59,103
[Man] Calvin, did you put
the tickets in your pocket?

37
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:01,271
He, like really is the
right man for the job.

38
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:02,104
(laughter)

39
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:02,937
- [Man] Oh, you did.

40
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,239
Oh you sneaky mom.

41
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,509
I thought you put them in your pocket.

42
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,343
Look.

43
00:01:06,343 --> 00:01:07,176
Look at his stance.

44
00:01:07,176 --> 00:01:11,343
- ♫ ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY AND Z.

45
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:25,592
♫ Now I know my ABC's.

46
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:29,127
♫ Next time won't you sing with me!

47
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:29,960
- [Man] Good job.

48
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,810
That's a great song, bud.

49
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,772
They're making us take out
all electronics that we have,

50
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:35,806
and putting them in buckets.

51
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:39,802
So we have a record seven
things on this tray right now

52
00:01:39,802 --> 00:01:41,007
for our family.

53
00:01:41,007 --> 00:01:42,424
- Ow, ow, ow, ow.

54
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,791
- [Man] Anything to pass
the time in the airport.

55
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:47,874
(laughter)

56
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,167
- His eyes are like ...

57
00:01:49,167 --> 00:01:52,093
- [Man] He is gonna fall
asleep in like, a minute.

58
00:01:52,093 --> 00:01:53,407
Oh, you're so ... Look it.

59
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:54,551
He is so tired.

60
00:01:54,551 --> 00:01:56,106
(child babble)

61
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:57,322
- [Man] Awww, good boy.

62
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,518
(laughter)

63
00:01:58,518 --> 00:02:00,412
Oh, he tricked you.

64
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,470
- I mean if the kid was
doing that to your crotch,

65
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,510
it would hurt so bad.

66
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,442
- [Man] Yeah

67
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:08,680
- He's doing it to my boobs and it hurts.

68
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,065
Probably not as bad as, you know.

69
00:02:10,065 --> 00:02:11,306
- [Man] Well, I don't know.

70
00:02:11,306 --> 00:02:12,139
- I don't know.

71
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,080
I don't know.

72
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,953
But it's not fun. (laughter)

73
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:17,391
- [Man] He does ... He thinks it is.

74
00:02:17,391 --> 00:02:18,334
- Alright.

75
00:02:18,334 --> 00:02:20,168
(happy scream)

76
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:21,001
- Told ya.

77
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:24,301
- I'm (inaudible) my car down this.

78
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,384
- [Man] Okay.

79
00:02:26,658 --> 00:02:27,594
Nice.

80
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:30,677
(happy guitar music)

81
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:39,263
- [Man] Penny!

82
00:02:39,263 --> 00:02:40,371
Hi girl.

83
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:42,175
How are you? Ohh! (laughter)

84
00:02:42,175 --> 00:02:44,375
Did you miss us so much?

85
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:46,805
You are so ... (surprised scream)

86
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:47,993
I love you, Penny.

87
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,002
I love you.

88
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,161
I missed you.

89
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:50,994
- [Woman] Where's your ball?

90
00:02:50,994 --> 00:02:51,827
- [Man] Go get your ball.

91
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:52,660
Ready?

92
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,889
(laughter)

93
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:55,021
- [Woman] You should
have put it on her head.

94
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:56,790
(laughter)

95
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,048
Calvin!

96
00:02:58,048 --> 00:02:59,384
You goof ball.

97
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:01,301
Guys, we're hooooooome!

98
00:03:02,255 --> 00:03:03,786
♫ We are home.

99
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:04,619
- Popping party.

100
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,989
Popping party.

101
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:07,833
Guys, we're home.

102
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,129
That was a very short flight.

103
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,179
And we have flown such
longer flights, but for some

104
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:16,617
reason, I feel like our
day ... it's only 4:30,

105
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:19,785
but I'm like, hmm, we can
all go to bed. (laughter)

106
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,535
- [Man] Baby brother.

107
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:24,643
- Baby brothhh.

108
00:03:27,783 --> 00:03:29,096
(laughter)

109
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,393
- [Man] Don't try and
pawn off your sandwich

110
00:03:31,393 --> 00:03:32,672
so you can have (laughter)

111
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:33,505
- I'm telling you.

112
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,763
You can have a treat after you eat ...

113
00:03:36,763 --> 00:03:38,899
- [Man] You have to eat
the whole thing, buddy.

114
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:39,891
Not just a bite.

115
00:03:39,891 --> 00:03:41,880
We have been watching Boss Baby a lot.

116
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,497
And like, the kids favorite
part of the entire movie

117
00:03:44,497 --> 00:03:48,149
is one, when the baby's bum
comes out and he's like,

118
00:03:48,149 --> 00:03:49,362
going through the conveyor belt.

119
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,195
Two, baby brotthhherr.

120
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:57,690
- Baby brothhherrr (laughter)

121
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,376
- It's just so funny to
have that slow motion.

122
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:03,339
There are some movies that just have these

123
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:05,724
quotable moments that
just keep you laughing

124
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:08,153
and laughing forever.

125
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:10,339
For me, when I was a kid,
it was on a Goofy movie,

126
00:04:10,339 --> 00:04:12,671
me and my sister, Jennifer,
would watch the part,

127
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:15,070
where the bus driver in
the first song was like ...

128
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,233
♫ I'm gonna sit on my butt.

129
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:20,769
That made us laugh and we
rewound that so many times.

130
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,496
What are your favorite funny movie quotes?

131
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,034
Let me know in the comments down below.

132
00:04:25,034 --> 00:04:27,357
I'd love to read through 'em
and watch that movie too.

133
00:04:27,357 --> 00:04:29,074
So make sure you have
the quote and the movie

134
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:30,657
so I can see exactly what it is.

135
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:32,628
- [Man] Jackson, you have a beard!

136
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,186
How did you grow a beard when
your dad can't even do it?

137
00:04:35,186 --> 00:04:37,119
Calvin, you have one too!

138
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:38,811
Oh, this gives me a good idea.

139
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,186
Arggh matey, the name's Bubble Beard.

140
00:04:41,186 --> 00:04:43,818
I'm here to take all of your bath bombs.

141
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:45,534
(sinister laughter)
Make you walk the plank.

142
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:46,367
Argghhh.

143
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:48,815
Argghhh.

144
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:51,662
(whispering) Shhh, just
take this real quick.

145
00:04:51,662 --> 00:04:52,495
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

146
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:53,805
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

147
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:56,201
There we go. Arggghhh.

148
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:59,959
It's Bubble Beard's wife! Wifey Beard.

149
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:00,850
- (gurgling)

150
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,315
- [Man] She is here to, ah ...

151
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:03,342
- Eat you!

152
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:04,810
- [Man] Eat you! Arrgghhh

153
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:07,618
Avast ye mateys and swab the deck.

154
00:05:07,618 --> 00:05:10,252
(intimidating grunting)

155
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:13,529
- [Man] You make the best bubble beards.

156
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,616
(laughter)

157
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:20,144
Ah yes, Mr Wise Long Beard
of the white, enjoying

158
00:05:20,144 --> 00:05:22,067
time being a mystical wizard.

159
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:23,768
- [Woman] Did you hear this?

160
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:25,225
- [Man] Was that a fart?

161
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,494
(child evil laughter)

162
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,284
- [Man] That was nasty.

163
00:05:29,284 --> 00:05:30,771
You did that on purpose.

164
00:05:30,771 --> 00:05:31,706
(raspberry farting)

165
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,557
Anytime we change Calvin's diaper,

166
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:36,177
he like, forces a fart out.

167
00:05:36,177 --> 00:05:38,391
It's the most disgusting
thing in the world.

168
00:05:38,391 --> 00:05:39,947
- [Woman] And he things it's so funny.

169
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,054
- He thinks it's funny.

170
00:05:41,054 --> 00:05:43,367
But it makes me wonder, I'm like, okay,

171
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,985
he's doing this intentionally.

172
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:48,683
I wonder if he's like,
ready for potty training.

173
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:50,457
Or at least to start like,
getting that in his ...

174
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:51,519
- Absolutely.

175
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,547
- [Man] Yeah.

176
00:05:52,547 --> 00:05:54,416
- I think he'll train pretty good.

177
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,660
- [Man] Yeah, absolutely.

178
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,493
- He loves copying Jackson.

179
00:05:56,493 --> 00:05:58,901
- [Man] Yeah, so this may be a good time,

180
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,470
a good growing experience
for you, young man.

181
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,467
Calvin, give me a thumbs up.

182
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:04,322
- (raspberry fart)

183
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:08,291
- Every time Jackson goes
potty, he will go ...

184
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,164
- [Man] And like, pretend.

185
00:06:09,164 --> 00:06:09,997
Yeah.

186
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:12,863
- And he won't go, but he'll
sit, which is good because

187
00:06:12,863 --> 00:06:14,772
Jackson at first was like, ...

188
00:06:14,772 --> 00:06:17,069
- [Man] I don't want to
sit on the toilet. Yeah.

189
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:19,301
- [Calvin] Mr Bum.

190
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,134
(laughter)

191
00:06:20,134 --> 00:06:22,427
- [Man] Mr Bum Baboo! (laughter)

192
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:23,728
I can't draw that, and you know that.

193
00:06:23,728 --> 00:06:25,070
Stop it!

194
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,625
Jackson, stop it!

195
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,658
- So I already showed you
guys what we're wearing for

196
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,483
family pictures tomorrow, which is this.

197
00:06:31,483 --> 00:06:33,763
And believe it or not, I do
not have any nude lipstick.

198
00:06:33,763 --> 00:06:35,992
I'd like to wear nude
lipstick with that dress.

199
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:39,833
I have a very bright pink
one, but I need more of like

200
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,642
a subtle nude one and
Bonnie has a lot of make-up.

201
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:44,575
I know she has nude lipstick.

202
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:45,408
I'm going to sneak in her house,

203
00:06:45,408 --> 00:06:47,101
and see if I can find one.

204
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:48,056
Without her knowing.

205
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,182
(whispers) Do you guys want to come?

206
00:06:49,182 --> 00:06:51,303
Shhh. I hear them.

207
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:53,959
(soft music)

208
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,607
They're in the back yard.

209
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:58,694
(louder piano music)

210
00:06:58,694 --> 00:06:59,527
Shh.

211
00:07:00,726 --> 00:07:01,559
Okay.

212
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,600
Shoot.

213
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:09,346
Bonnie's right there.

214
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,346
(suspenseful music)

215
00:07:19,954 --> 00:07:22,037
- [Bonnie] Wait, hold on.

216
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,632
(dishes clanging)

217
00:07:34,632 --> 00:07:35,854
- Holy shizz.

218
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:37,602
Look at all of her make-up.

219
00:07:37,602 --> 00:07:40,443
(hyperventilating)

220
00:07:40,443 --> 00:07:42,001
(whispering) This is perfect.

221
00:07:42,001 --> 00:07:43,334
This is perfect.

222
00:07:46,293 --> 00:07:47,210
Two orange.

223
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,477
Oh, that's a good nude.

224
00:07:51,477 --> 00:07:52,898
Fox.

225
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,372
Maybe I'll take that.

226
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:55,525
Too dark.

227
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,309
That's a good one too.

228
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,759
That's called Velvet Teddy.

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,779
Oh shoot.

230
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:02,116
I'm so nervous. That's red.

231
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:03,916
That'll work. That'll work.

232
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,749
Hellooo. (laughter)

233
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,985
- Oh my god. (laughter)

234
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,639
- Do you care if I have some lipsticks?

235
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,472
- No.

236
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:13,131
(laughter)

237
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:14,659
Lipsticks?

238
00:08:14,659 --> 00:08:17,287
- I need some nude lipstick
for pictures tomorrow.

239
00:08:17,287 --> 00:08:18,503
- Did you already go get 'em?

240
00:08:18,503 --> 00:08:20,580
(laughter)

241
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,939
- Lovely lady.

242
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,867
- [Woman] I'm surprised your kids are up.

243
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,946
Hi cuties.

244
00:08:24,946 --> 00:08:26,017
- [Bonnie] Believe me.

245
00:08:26,017 --> 00:08:27,485
We took a really late nap today.

246
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:29,580
- [Woman] I know. It
takes me back forever.

247
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,307
(laughter)

248
00:08:32,307 --> 00:08:34,115
- Seriously, let's find you a good nude.

249
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:36,457
(laughter)

250
00:08:36,457 --> 00:08:37,688
Not this one.

251
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:39,580
- I know, I was like, "that's red". Ew.

252
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,756
Too red.

253
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:44,861
- [Woman] Um, Bonnie has
a plethora of makeup.

254
00:08:44,861 --> 00:08:48,091
See, I wonder if that will
be too old nudie for me.

255
00:08:48,091 --> 00:08:48,946
That might be too pink.

256
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:49,990
This is Teddy.

257
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,823
- [Bonnie] Faux.

258
00:08:50,823 --> 00:08:53,499
- [Woman] I think Faux might be my guy.

259
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:55,121
- [Bonnie] I do have one called Teddy.

260
00:08:55,121 --> 00:08:56,065
Oh, Velvet Teddy.

261
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,494
- [Woman] Yes, and that's a
good one. I used to have that.

262
00:08:58,494 --> 00:08:59,673
Then I used it up.

263
00:08:59,673 --> 00:09:01,365
Okay, I think one of
these two will be great.

264
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:02,198
- [Bonnie] Okay.

265
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,563
- [Woman] Thank you.

266
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:06,097
I'm very excited for family pictures.

267
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:06,930
- [Bonnie] Yay!

268
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,826
- Okay guys, Faux is
underneath, Teddy's ups top.

269
00:09:09,826 --> 00:09:11,842
Think Teddy would look
better with the dress.

270
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,452
Cause the dress is kind of busy.

271
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,135
Teddy is mat and it's brown.

272
00:09:15,135 --> 00:09:17,415
This is more shimmery. Do you think?

273
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:18,248
- [Bonnie] Deal.

274
00:09:18,248 --> 00:09:20,175
You plug the curling iron in.

275
00:09:20,175 --> 00:09:21,425
You turn it on.

276
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,089
You push "home".

277
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,855
- [Woman] That's weird. Home?

278
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:26,736
- [Bonnie] Yeah.

279
00:09:26,736 --> 00:09:27,590
- [Woman] The first time?

280
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,921
- Yeah. Home key.

281
00:09:28,921 --> 00:09:29,930
- [Woman] Okay, girl.

282
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,991
Um, Bonnie's letting (laughter)

283
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:35,509
Bonnie's letting me use her
curing iron tomorrow too.

284
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,689
So she's going .. I'm going
to test it out and see.

285
00:09:37,689 --> 00:09:39,314
It's a new curling iron.

286
00:09:39,314 --> 00:09:41,742
- I have to be nice, because
when I want your stuff

287
00:09:41,742 --> 00:09:43,391
(laughter) I'll be able to take it.

288
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,481
- [Woman] You really don't
want me to take your stuff,

289
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:45,561
but you're going to let me.

290
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:46,394
- [Bonnie] Yes I do.

291
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:47,873
- So now it's not on
home because I moved it.

292
00:09:47,873 --> 00:09:48,706
Is that okay?

293
00:09:48,706 --> 00:09:49,539
- [Bonnie] Yeah, it's okay.

294
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:52,484
It'll kind of move, so put it towards ...

295
00:09:52,484 --> 00:09:53,818
It's really hard to get used to.

296
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:55,208
- What button do I push to make it go up?

297
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,490
- [Bonnie] Away from your face.

298
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,869
- Oh my gosh.

299
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,498
- [Bonnie] I know, it's
really weird to get used to,

300
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,551
but when you do ...

301
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:01,384
- I'm going to burn my hair.

302
00:10:01,384 --> 00:10:02,217
- [Bonnie] Oh my gosh.

303
00:10:02,217 --> 00:10:03,650
You've got to put your hair in it.

304
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,825
It's not. It's not.

305
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:05,658
Go lower.

306
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:06,685
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

307
00:10:06,685 --> 00:10:07,518
(laughter)

308
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:08,351
Put it a little lower.

309
00:10:08,351 --> 00:10:09,676
Okay, clamp it and then push the button.

310
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:11,443
Other way, other way, other way.

311
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:12,276
(laughter)

312
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:13,109
- I don't like this.

313
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:14,376
- [Bonnie] Okay, not
stop, stop. (laughter)

314
00:10:14,376 --> 00:10:15,247
- Now can I slide it out?

315
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,094
- [Bonnie] Yeah.

316
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,212
- Or do I have to unravel it out?

317
00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,452
- [Bonnie] No, you can just let it go.

318
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,285
- Okay.

319
00:10:20,285 --> 00:10:21,118
- [Bonnie] Do you like the curl?

320
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:22,367
- I do.

321
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,077
Is that too high up?

322
00:10:24,077 --> 00:10:26,317
- [Bonnie] No. On the
most delicate piece ever.

323
00:10:26,317 --> 00:10:27,361
(laughter)

324
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:28,194
- I know, so I can burn this one.

325
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,927
(laughter)

326
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,841
- [Bonnie] Don't be scared.

327
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,018
- This is the weirdest
flipping thing I've ever used.

328
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,593
- [Bonnie] But like,
don't you like the curl?

329
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,617
Isn't that a nice curl?

330
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:39,936
- Beach Waver, huh?

331
00:10:39,936 --> 00:10:41,759
- [Bonnie] I didn't think that
it would make a difference,

332
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,046
and then I went back
to my old curling iron,

333
00:10:44,046 --> 00:10:45,117
and I was like, "Oh".

334
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:47,904
- I feel like ... I
hate ... I have anxiety.

335
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:48,922
(laughter)

336
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,352
- [Bonnie] Because you think
you're going to fry your hair.

337
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:51,327
- Cause yeah, freakin' ...

338
00:10:51,327 --> 00:10:52,234
- [Bonnie] You can like ... yep, yep.

339
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,067
- Yeah.

340
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:53,900
- [Bonnie] That's what I was going to say.

341
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,185
Just let it down just a little.

342
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:56,625
Look how cool the curl is.

343
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,767
It's pretty.

344
00:10:57,767 --> 00:10:59,778
- Okay, so when I curl my hair tomorrow,

345
00:10:59,778 --> 00:11:01,998
should I just curl all away from my face?

346
00:11:01,998 --> 00:11:03,164
- [Bonnie] That's what I do, but you

347
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:04,910
always do one forward, one backward.

348
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,710
- Sometimes, not all the time.

349
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,683
- [Bonnie] Cute I like it.

350
00:11:08,683 --> 00:11:09,871
- Should I do it curly or straight?

351
00:11:09,871 --> 00:11:10,704
Curly.

352
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:11,767
(laughter)

353
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,416
I'm having anxiety.

354
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,142
- [Bonnie] I like curly.
It's soft and pretty.

355
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,717
- I like, just cut it, so I'm like,

356
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,994
"Oh, what am I doing with my hair?"

357
00:11:17,994 --> 00:11:20,197
I don't even know how to fix it right now.

358
00:11:20,197 --> 00:11:22,726
And to use this new bad boy?

359

Ellie and I were just
talking about how much fun

367

we had this weekend, and
how much of a blast it was.

00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:36,503
Being with care bears
and not only that, just

369
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:37,655
being at the hotel.

00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,046
Everyone at the hotel ...
