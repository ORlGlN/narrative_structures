1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,381
- Thank you for purchasing your ticket

2
00:00:01,381 --> 00:00:03,440
to the live action play.

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,976
- Our very last private meeting.

4
00:00:05,976 --> 00:00:07,207
(screams)
- Secret meeting--

5
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,860
- [Jared] Who's gonna fight me?

6
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,993
- Good morning, guys.

7
00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:11,624
I'm getting my hair done.

8
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,570
I need to get freshened up.

9
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:17,250
I'm not really gonna do anything crazy,

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,730
I never really do with my hair.

11
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:22,289
So just a little trim today, and a little

12
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,430
touch-up on the roots.

13
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,290
You slept so good!

14
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,865
I'm proud of you.

15
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:28,440
Say hi to our friends.

16
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,860
- Hi, friend.

17
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,950
- Good morning! (chuckles)

18
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,090
How are you?

19
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,084
Hi, Jacks.

20
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:35,861
- [Jackson] Hi.

21
00:00:35,861 --> 00:00:38,156
- You slept so good, too!

22
00:00:38,156 --> 00:00:40,220
- Look in the mirror if I see boogers.

23
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:43,630
- (laughs) Any boogers?

24
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,463
- Yep.

25
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:46,610
- Oh, dang it, gotta get 'em out.

26
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:48,820
- Hi.

27
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,803
- Hi, Jare.

28
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:51,210
- [Jared] Hi, Mom.

29
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,257
- [Ellie] How was your workout?

30
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:53,278
- Good.

31
00:00:53,278 --> 00:00:54,510
Hey!

32
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:55,550
- [Ellie] Brutal?

33
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,730
- Oh my gosh, Ellie.

34
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,219
It was tough, but I'm good.

35
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,110
We did these crow
positions, like yoga stuff.

36
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:02,943
- Yeah.

37
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:04,510
- And I was like the only
person who could do it,

38
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,740
and I've never done it before.
- What?! Show me.

39
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,810
- Well, I don't know if I
can do it now, but I'll try.

40
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,235
And you hold it for two minutes.

41
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:11,460
- [Ellie] Wow.

42
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,822
That's cool! (laughs)

43
00:01:13,822 --> 00:01:16,988
- And anything that I had
left with my hip is gone.

44
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:19,194
I need to go to the hospital. (laughs)

45
00:01:19,194 --> 00:01:21,403
- Ready for the owie?

46
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:22,739
- [Ellie] Do you have an owie, too?

47
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:23,948
- [Calvin] Yeah.

48
00:01:23,948 --> 00:01:25,640
- [Ellie] I have an owie.

49
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,150
Oh my gosh, this is like, the worst pain.

50
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,530
I'm trying to think of what
else has hurt really bad.

51
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,650
After having a baby.

52
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,330
So I had my ingrown toenail taken out,

53
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,940
and she said it's going
to be super, super sore,

54
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,670
and the doctor was very correct.

55
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,550
It has been super, super sore to walk on.

56
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,043
I'm just soaking it
right now in epsom salt,

57
00:01:47,043 --> 00:01:50,323
and I'm just like biting my cheeks,

58
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:52,372
just being like, just maybe another week

59
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:53,707
and it'll be better.

60
00:01:53,707 --> 00:01:56,360
(groans, laughs)

61
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,920
Put the heater vent on, Calvin.

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,648
- [Jackson] Don't put my knife in it,

63
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:01,750
don't put my knife in it!

64
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,600
- [Ellie] He won't.

65
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,770
'Kay, go put the kid knife away, okay?

66
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,616
You're just trying to fix
stuff around the house?

67
00:02:06,616 --> 00:02:08,624
'Kay, Calvin, look at Mom.

68
00:02:08,624 --> 00:02:10,080
Go put it away.

69
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,840
I'll soak it and then I'll show you guys.

70
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,210
And I'm warning you now if you don't want

71
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,260
to see, you can just skip.

72
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,590
'Kay, warning shot.

73
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,187
After soaking my foot for 20
minutes, it looks much better.

74
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:23,388
It was not very appealing
when I took the Band-Aid off.

75
00:02:23,388 --> 00:02:26,210
But see how deep that's
cut out, and how far?

76
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,870
Like, it's just raw, and
super sore to walk on.

77
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,340
And it's done!

78
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,691
I just got a little trim and touched up

79
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:35,180
my roots a little bit.

80
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,618
This was the last hair
appointment that I have.

81
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:42,148
Well, I have one more hair
appointment until I have baby.

82
00:02:42,148 --> 00:02:45,829
So, the beginning of June, I
have my next hair appointment,

83
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,710
and then a few weeks later,
I have baby! (screams)

84
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,437
It was weird booking it, I was like, okay,

85
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,427
gonna be really big, I'm
gonna be really swollen,

86
00:02:54,427 --> 00:02:56,668
really uncomfortable, and
I'll get my hair fresh

87
00:02:56,668 --> 00:02:59,390
for the month and that
will feel so good in June.

88
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,023
This salon is so awesome,
they always have bath bombs.

89
00:03:03,023 --> 00:03:05,405
I don't care what bath,
any bath bomb is amazing,

90
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:07,704
so I grabbed a handful for the boys

91
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:10,000
because they always steal my bath bombs,

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,550
so me and the boys have some bath bombs.

93
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,050
- Behind this door is
something very, very cool,

94
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,290
and I'm excited to show you.

95
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,189
Let's go inside.

96
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:19,109
Ellie is waiting for us.

97
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:21,026
(beep)

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,433
- We had our very last, after a year,

99
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:31,687
our very last private meeting! (screams)

100
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:32,520
- Secret meeting from everybody.

101
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,847
- On March 5th, you guys will know.

102
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:37,103
I can't, it's been amazing,
but we've had meetings

103
00:03:37,103 --> 00:03:40,600
all afternoon, can't wait
to go home, kiss my babies.

104
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,526
- So in order to celebrate
this monumental occasion

105
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:45,662
of having our last secret meeting,

106
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:48,791
we are having a little dessert!

107
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,631
Celebration.
- A pig out.

108
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:51,781
- Yeah. (laughs)

109
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:54,400
We've got cookies and ice cream,

110
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,463
waffle fries, and doughnuts.

111
00:03:56,463 --> 00:04:00,810
Oh man. Our next project should
be like how to lose weight.

112
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,130
- You worked out this
morning, so we're good.

113
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,733
- Oh yeah, yeah, it cancels it out, yeah.

114
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,829
(Calvin yells)

115
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,310
(boys grunting)

116
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,143
- [Jackson] Yay!

117
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:10,976
(Ellie laughs)

118
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:13,322
- [Jared] A new competitor
has entered the battlefield!

119
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:16,353
- [Ellie] 'Kay, last chance,
we'll see if Calvin can win it.

120
00:04:16,353 --> 00:04:17,520
- Three, five!

121
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,177
- [Ellie] Oh, oh, Penny got Calvin down!

122
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:26,811
(laughs)

123
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,560
- Who's gonna fight me?

124
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,393
- Me!

125
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:30,226
- Let's do it.

126
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:31,630
All the way back there.

127
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,500
- Three, five!

128
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,598
(Jared grunts)

129
00:04:36,598 --> 00:04:39,552
- [Ellie] Dad wins, like always!

130
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:40,783
- [Jared] I'll protect you!

131
00:04:40,783 --> 00:04:42,698
I'll protect you from her!

132
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:45,030
I'll protect you, I'll protect you!

133
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,020
So most of the kid's pajamas
are in the dirty laundry,

134
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,100
so we have to make do with what we have.

135
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,370
So we are busting out these guys.

136
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,306
Can anyone tell me what these shirts are?

137
00:04:54,306 --> 00:04:55,215
- [Jackson] Nemo.

138
00:04:55,215 --> 00:04:56,840
- [Jared] Nemo, you guys are gonna be

139
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Finding Nemo buddies today.

140
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,750
Do you remember when we got these shirts?

141
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,380
- [Calvin] My Nemo!

142
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,213
- [Jared] Yeah!

143
00:05:03,213 --> 00:05:04,830
Actually, swap 'em.

144
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,929
This one's Calvin's, and
that one's Jackson's.

145
00:05:06,929 --> 00:05:09,210
We got these when we went on the big,

146
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,300
big Disney boat on the Disney cruise.

147
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,133
Yeah, that one's yours.

148
00:05:13,133 --> 00:05:14,713
Do you guys remember going
on the Disney cruise?

149
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,660
- Yeah.

150
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,910
- That was so much fun.

151
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,602
We had such a blast, in
fact, we have a playlist

152
00:05:19,602 --> 00:05:20,612
of our Disney cruise.

153
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,034
I'll have that linked in the iCard,

154
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:24,493
and down below so you guys
can see the whole cruise

155
00:05:24,493 --> 00:05:26,190
if you guys haven't seen that just yet.

156
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,412
Let's get in our pajamas, and
we'll do a little Nemo song.

157
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:32,400
Little Nemo dance, a
little Nemo sleepy time.

158
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,060
Got it? Oh, you're already
in character, perfect.

159
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,237
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

160
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,901
thank you for purchasing your ticket

161
00:05:38,901 --> 00:05:42,897
to the live action play of Finding Nemo!

162
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:43,860
(kids cheering)

163
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,720
We've got a wonderful cast here, we've got

164
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,810
Jackson playing Marlin,
and Calvin playing Nemo.

165
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,643
Are you guys ready?

166
00:05:50,643 --> 00:05:51,476
- Yep.

167
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:55,050
- Okay. Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful family.

168
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,510
Nemo and Marlin.

169
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:00,023
Hi, I'm Marlin, I'm Nemo's dad.

170
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:04,930
Hi, I'm Nemo, I'm Nemo's, I'm
Marlin's son. (Calvin laughs)

171
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,657
Once upon a time, these two
fish loved each other very much,

172
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,440
but they had a complicated relationship

173
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,570
because this guy wanted
to go out and explore,

174
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,995
and this guy was kinda sensitive
because of previous events.

175
00:06:13,995 --> 00:06:16,192
This guy touched the
butt, and then this guy

176
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:17,762
started looking for him,
because he didn't want him

177
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:18,870
to touch the butt.

178
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,464
And then this guy, who
got captured by the butt,

179
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:22,762
or rather the people in the butt,

180
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:25,514
and then this guy went looking for him.

181
00:06:25,514 --> 00:06:27,865
He ended up in a tank with
a crazy girl with braces,

182
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,435
and you traveled far across
the sea with turtles,

183
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:32,498
and sharks, and all other kinds of fish.

184
00:06:32,498 --> 00:06:33,790
And then you found each other.

185
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:36,756
The end! Yay!
(kids cheering)

186
00:06:36,756 --> 00:06:40,255
(Calvin and Jackson babbling)

187
00:06:40,255 --> 00:06:42,435
Good job, Nemos. (laughs)

188
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,250
Now we're destroying the stage.

189
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,610
It's all part of the, you
know, the price of admission.

190
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,762
I know the tickets were very expensive,

191
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:50,778
so thank you guys for
supporting us in this action.

192
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,007
And the stage is gone.

193
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:53,840
- This one.

194
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,601
- Uncle Ryan and Aunt Maria.

195
00:06:57,601 --> 00:06:58,434
- This one?

196
00:06:58,434 --> 00:07:03,044
- Uncle Nate, Uncle Nate
and Aunt Eva and Elwyn.

197
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:03,927
(Calvin laughs)

198
00:07:03,927 --> 00:07:07,175
- Jackson is reading
Calvin our family book

199
00:07:07,175 --> 00:07:09,854
that I think Uncle Nate and Aunt Megan

200
00:07:09,854 --> 00:07:11,774
made a couple Christmases ago.

201
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:13,190
It's just so sweet, so they flip through

202
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,871
and they see the whole
family, at that point,

203
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,677
that they can get to know the names,

204
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:20,564
and pictures, and it's
just a really fun book

205
00:07:20,564 --> 00:07:21,900
for little kids.

206
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,140
And they're going to sleep now.

207
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,600
That's all, we're done, yes!

208
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't look very good?

209
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,513
- [Ellie] Mm-hmm.

210
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:27,346
- Oh, geez.

211
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,179
- I said, "What's wrong?"

212
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:29,620
He's like, "Well, let me
tell you on the vlog."

213
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,373
- Been in my office for
the past little while,

214
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:35,560
and I'm at the point of
the day, or something,

215
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,440
I really don't even know
what I'm saying right now.

216
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I'm so tired that I don't know
what I'm doing in the office.

217
00:07:43,126 --> 00:07:45,080
Like, I sat in my chair, and I was like,

218
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,462
"What was I supposed to be doing?"

219
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,869
And I sat there for like 10 minutes.

220
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:51,702
- Do you want to just come to bed?

221
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:52,535
Do you want a grape?

222
00:07:52,535 --> 00:07:53,368
- Yeah, I do.

223
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:55,410
I was like, I think Jared,
it's just time to bed.

224
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,700
Just put it away, you
can save it for tomorrow.

225
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,940
- I'm sorry.

226
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,870
- Oh, it's okay.

227
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,231
We had a good day today.

228
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,064
- [Ellie] Oh, of course.

229
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,880
- It's been a great, busy, fun day.

230
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,270
I wouldn't trade it for the world.

231
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,103
- [Ellie] No.

232
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:08,543
- The best thing in the
world is to be completely

233
00:08:08,543 --> 00:08:12,212
exhausted after, like, a
good day of work, you know?

234
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:13,045
- Totes.

235
00:08:13,045 --> 00:08:14,410
- [Jared] Yeah, totes magotes.

236
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,471
We've had a good secret last meeting, huh?

237
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:18,304
- I'm sorry, I know it's
annoying for you guys,

238
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:22,110
but obviously, we just, it's
been a year in the making,

239
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,870
and it's just we just have to be quiet

240
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,630
until it's like a legit thing. (laughs)

241
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,930
- Yeah. Well, speaking of,
it almost is a legit thing.

242
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,280
And if you want to find out exactly when

243
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,114
it is a legit thing, check
the link in the description.

244
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:37,220
You can find out with
that link exactly when

245
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,192
all of this is coming...

246
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:41,500
- [Ellie] To fruition.
- To fruition.

247
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,600
To your eyeballs.

248
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,460
- I have a question.

249
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,130
The Bachelor.

250
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,931
They usually don't say,
like, "I love you,"

251
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:48,475
but I feel like the last few seasons,

252
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:52,360
the person tells many
people that they love them,

253
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,500
and then it confuses the
heck out of everyone.

254
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,333
- [Jared] Yeah.

255
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,320
- I used to think that was a
rule, but I guess it's not.

256
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,318
- Rules are made to be broken.

257
00:08:58,318 --> 00:08:59,590
- [Ellie] 'Kay, come to bed.

258
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,693
- [Jared] 'Kay, all right.

259
00:09:00,693 --> 00:09:01,526
- Thanks, guys.

260
00:09:01,526 --> 00:09:03,664
- Thank you guys, and we
will see you next time.

261
00:09:03,664 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
