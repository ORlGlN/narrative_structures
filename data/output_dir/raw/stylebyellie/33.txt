1
00:00:00,159 --> 00:00:03,317
- What could you possibly be
doing, and I'm not involved?

2
00:00:03,317 --> 00:00:04,799
You're smiling.

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:06,348
See, I told you he could do it.

4
00:00:06,348 --> 00:00:07,272
Juice in a cup.

5
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,605
- Juice in cup!

6
00:00:11,408 --> 00:00:15,454
Good morning, guys. I think
someone is loving the home pot.

7
00:00:15,454 --> 00:00:17,724
- (singing) Home again

8
00:00:17,724 --> 00:00:19,214
- [Jared] Your nails are so pretty today.

9
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:22,219
- I matched my nails to my lipstick.

10
00:00:22,219 --> 00:00:24,929
I am wearing 'Under the
Thumb'. - [Jared] Oh.

11
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,041
- Thanks for getting this for me

12
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,462
- [Jared] You're welcome

13
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,615
(Singing) From now on,

14
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:35,702
what's waited till
tomorrow starts tonight!

15
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,750
It starts tonight!

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,242
Ellie and I are making the bed right now,

17
00:00:39,242 --> 00:00:40,658
and I just put this pillow on,

18
00:00:40,658 --> 00:00:42,837
and she said "get the
pillow the right way".

19
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:45,055
So, it was like this.

20
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:46,160
So is there a difference--

21
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,325
- [Ellie] It's 'cause the bottom.

22
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:48,195
- [Jared] Oh, the bottom.

23
00:00:48,195 --> 00:00:49,790
Okay, so where's the bottom?

24
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:50,942
Okay, so this line.

25
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:52,946
That's the identifying
feature of the pillow.

26
00:00:52,946 --> 00:00:56,487
'Cause I'm looking at the
design, and I'm just like--

27
00:00:56,487 --> 00:00:57,320
- [Ellie] How do you know?

28
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,439
- [Jared] How do you even know?

29
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,189
One thing that I love about Ellie,

30
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:02,125
is every day our bed is made.

31
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:05,370
And that is just like such
a clean looking thing.

32
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,525
It just makes our bed--
oh, we're missing a pillow.

33
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,276
We're missing three pillows.

34
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:10,340
Holy cow!

35
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,628
- Jackson and Calvin always
help me with the pillows.

36
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:13,823
They know the right way.

37
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,188
- They do know the right
way, I guess I need to learn.

38
00:01:16,188 --> 00:01:18,839
But, making your bed is
something simple that you can do

39
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,489
to make your room feel that much better.

40
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:22,019
- [Ellie] I'm not wearing underwear!

41
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:23,781
- Don't worry, you can't see anything!

42
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,700
Okay, now we're done.

43
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,722
Ellie, put some pants on!

44
00:01:25,722 --> 00:01:26,555
- [Ellie] Jared!

45
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:27,388
- [Jared] What?

46
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,574
- [Ellie] There's the pillow.

47
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:30,099
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

48
00:01:30,099 --> 00:01:31,234
Is that better?

49
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:32,297
(Ellie Whoops)

50
00:01:32,297 --> 00:01:33,599
- [Jared] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

51
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,801
Where do you think
you're going, young man?

52
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,946
What, you're going to school?

53
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:38,456
Oh okay, don't you think you need someone

54
00:01:38,456 --> 00:01:40,252
to drive you to school first?

55
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:41,085
- No.

56
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:41,918
- [Jared] No?

57
00:01:41,918 --> 00:01:42,751
You're just gonna walk?

58
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,584
- Mhm.

59
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:45,507
- [Jared] Okay, well
have fun at school, okay?

60
00:01:45,507 --> 00:01:46,340
- Okay.

61
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,358
- [Jared] Love you.

62
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,191
Bye, bye.

63
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,041
'Kay, he's going to school, mom.

64
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:52,394
Mom and dad didn't
think that it was enough

65
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:55,097
for just us to go to the dentist, 'kay?

66
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:55,930
Alright?

67
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,181
So guess what.

68
00:01:57,181 --> 00:02:00,658
You, and you are going to the dentist now.

69
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:03,292
We are gonna have some fun at the dentist!

70
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:06,433
- Are you driving us there,
and are you both gonna stay?

71
00:02:06,433 --> 00:02:08,163
- [Jared] Yep, you better believe it.

72
00:02:08,163 --> 00:02:09,008
- We'll stay with you.

73
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:10,860
- [Jared] Yep, sound good?

74
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
- Yep.

75
00:02:11,693 --> 00:02:12,526
- [Jared] We're gonna make sure

76
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:14,460
those pearly whites are nice and clean.

77
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,602
Calvin, can you show me your teeth?

78
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:17,918
(Jarred laughs)

79
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:18,751
Can you show me your teeth?

80
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:19,645
Yeah!

81
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,687
- [Ellie] Let me see them.

82
00:02:20,687 --> 00:02:22,015
Are they white, or are they yellow?

83
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:22,903
- [Jared] Are they brown?

84
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,173
- My eye's brown.

85
00:02:24,173 --> 00:02:25,774
- [Jared] Your eyes are
brown, that's right.

86
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:27,607
What about your teeth?

87
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,094
- Red.

88
00:02:30,094 --> 00:02:32,182
- [Jared] Yeah, that's red.

89
00:02:32,182 --> 00:02:34,366
Everything but his teeth.

90
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,632
Well, you definitely
look like you're ready

91
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:37,245
for your first dentist appointment.

92
00:02:37,245 --> 00:02:38,516
Say "cheese"!

93
00:02:38,516 --> 00:02:41,099
(Jared laughs)

94
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:43,827
Say "cheese"!

95
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:44,864
- Cheese!

96
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,452
- [Jared] You're kind of a
professional at this point, huh?

97
00:02:47,452 --> 00:02:48,623
Did you do good?

98
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,206
Show me your teeth.

99
00:02:51,364 --> 00:02:53,353
Yeah, they're still all there,
they didn't take any out.

100
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:55,955
Should we ask them if
they'll take any out for ya?

101
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:56,891
(Jared laughs)

102
00:02:56,891 --> 00:02:57,751
I'm just kidding.

103
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,994
You were giving us a little
trouble there, weren't ya?

104
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:01,608
You didn't wanna open your mouth, did you?

105
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:02,708
Can you open your mouth for me?

106
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,187
Say "aah".

107
00:03:04,187 --> 00:03:05,561
Show me your teeth.

108
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,728
(babbles)

109
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,641
- Can you hear it?

110
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:12,698
- [Jared] Do you hear it, Calvin?

111
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:13,563
Do you hear the movie?

112
00:03:13,563 --> 00:03:17,504
We've got LEGO Batman, and Wreck it Ralph.

113
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:20,254
(Cheerful music)

114
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:30,282
On the way home from the
dentist Calvin and Ellie zonked.

115
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:31,115
They're asleep right now.

116
00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:32,888
But, it went fifty percent great,

117
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:35,452
and fifty percent not so great.

118
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:37,412
M-mm, uh-uh, wasn't great at all.

119
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:38,858
Are you playing Zelda?

120
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:40,188
You are crazy, dude.

121
00:03:40,188 --> 00:03:41,648
Hey, Jackson wait real quick.

122
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:43,224
Let's put this down for just a minute.

123
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,891
I want you to tell me about the dentist.

124
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,956
- I did so good.

125
00:03:45,956 --> 00:03:46,979
- [Jared] You did so good.

126
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:48,113
And what did they do to you?

127
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:49,939
- They cleaned my teeth.

128
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:52,089
- [Jared] Did they take
pictures of your teeth?

129
00:03:52,089 --> 00:03:54,180
And what did the dentist
say about your teeth?

130
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,479
- No cavities.

131
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,357
- [Jared] No cavities!

132
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:58,728
High-five, good job.

133
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,344
That's great, bud.

134
00:04:00,344 --> 00:04:04,033
- [Jared] This poor guy, I'm
gonna tell you all about it.

135
00:04:04,033 --> 00:04:06,746
Look, he's got a little
Papa Troll with him.

136
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,264
Poor Calvin, and I think the
timing just wasn't that great.

137
00:04:10,264 --> 00:04:12,348
It was like 12:30, 1 o'clock.

138
00:04:12,348 --> 00:04:14,686
Like, right before, if
Calvin does take a nap,

139
00:04:14,686 --> 00:04:16,832
it's about that Calvin takes a nap.

140
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,101
And I can tell he was pretty tired.

141
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,662
He's not feeling well,
probably 'cause of this guy.

142
00:04:20,663 --> 00:04:21,688
Plumber's crack!

143
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:25,175
And he, I think he's just
catching what Jackson had.

144
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,720
So he wasn't feeling all that great,

145
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,607
he didn't really want
to be poked and prodded

146
00:04:29,607 --> 00:04:30,539
and all of that stuff.

147
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:32,206
He did really great with
the dental assistant,

148
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:34,200
and was showing me how
he would "open wide".

149
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,996
But, once the dentist actually came in

150
00:04:35,996 --> 00:04:37,229
and started looking at things he just,

151
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,141
he didn't wanna be there,

152
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,354
and he didn't want someone's
fingers in his mouth.

153
00:04:40,354 --> 00:04:42,273
But, poor guy, as soon
as we got in the car

154
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:45,000
he fell asleep and zonked out.

155
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,349
But all in all, for a
first dentist appointment,

156
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,320
I don't think it was that bad.

157
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,117
Next time, he'll be
better because of timing.

158
00:04:52,117 --> 00:04:53,482
I think that was the huge issue

159
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:55,592
was the time of day that
we went to the dentist.

160
00:04:55,592 --> 00:04:58,366
Hopefully, when he wakes up
he'll feel a little better.

161
00:04:58,366 --> 00:04:59,999
[Jared] What did you want, little monster?

162
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,152
- Juice in cup.

163
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:02,098
- [Jared] Juice in a cup?

164
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:03,322
What do you want?

165
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:04,524
- Juice in cup!

166
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:05,501
- [Jared] Juice in a cup!

167
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,425
What do you want?

168
00:05:06,425 --> 00:05:07,656
- Juice cup!

169
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:08,966
- [Jared] Juice in a cup!

170
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:09,799
Juice in a cup!

171
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:14,101
Hey, you had the longest nap of your life.

172
00:05:14,101 --> 00:05:15,344
Do you feel better?

173
00:05:15,344 --> 00:05:16,415
- Yeah!

174
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,475
- [Jared] Good!

175
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,883
Hey, can you do something for me?

176
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:20,257
Open wide, say "aah".

177
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:21,160
- Aah!

178
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,778
- See, I told you he could do it!

179
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:23,989
I told ya!

180
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:25,390
We've been practicing.

181
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,504
We actually did practice before
the dentist's appointment.

182
00:05:28,504 --> 00:05:29,692
Did we go to the dentist today?

183
00:05:29,692 --> 00:05:30,566
- Uh-huh.

184
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,399
- [Jared] Was it good?

185
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,232
- Mhm.

186
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,627
- [Jared] Good, what did you do?

187
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:35,420
- Um, they poked.

188
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,817
- [Jared] Yeah, did
they look at your teeth?

189
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,441
Good job.

190
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:41,618
Hey, it was kinda rough but
we got through it, right?

191
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,312
They looked at all your
teeth, and then they said

192
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:44,783
they looked really good, didn't they?

193
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:45,667
- Yeah.

194
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:47,757
- Yeah, do you want your juice in a cup?

195
00:05:47,757 --> 00:05:49,075
- Yeah, juice cup.

196
00:05:49,075 --> 00:05:50,294
- Okay.

197
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:52,359
Juice in a cup.

198
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:53,359
- Juicy cup!

199
00:05:54,441 --> 00:05:55,844
- [Jared] I always wonder,

200
00:05:55,844 --> 00:05:58,682
you're texting and
smiling at the same time.

201
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:02,811
- I swear I'm not on my
phone, Jared, all the time!

202
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:04,853
- Well, you're smiling
and texting so I'm like,

203
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:08,477
what could you possibly be
doing and I'm not involved.

204
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,432
You're smiling!

205
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:11,284
- I was writing back to
Britney's Instagram story,

206
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:14,696
because she's going to the
Black Panther and I said

207
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:18,272
"oh, we were gonna go too,
and then our plans changed,

208
00:06:18,272 --> 00:06:19,817
and now Jared's gonna go."

209
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,696
- Which is true.
- That's okay, I don't care.

210
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:23,306
I mean, I care, I don't
wanna sound like I don't,

211
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:25,126
but, like, I'm good staying back.

212
00:06:25,126 --> 00:06:25,986
- Yeah.

213
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:27,704
- We had a babysitter tonight

214
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:28,964
and we were gonna go to the movies,

215
00:06:28,964 --> 00:06:31,374
but like a few hours ago I was just like

216
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:34,305
I think I'm just gonna stay
back with the kids tonight.

217
00:06:34,305 --> 00:06:37,463
Because we've got a
sitter for tomorrow night,

218
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,895
and Calvin was kinda coughing a lot,

219
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:41,212
like Jackson was the other day,

220
00:06:41,212 --> 00:06:44,605
I just felt like I just
needed to stay home.

221
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:46,658
So, that's what we're gonna do.

222
00:06:46,658 --> 00:06:48,581
And they're happily
playing now downstairs.

223
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,682
- Oh my gosh, it's so funny,
I heard Jackson downstairs

224
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:53,808
was saying like, "you're so cute!"

225
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:55,206
"You're so cute!"

226
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,566
"You're so cute!"

227
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,197
to Calvin, and it was just--

228
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:00,233
- And then Calvin screamed,
'cause he's a turd.

229
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:02,065
- So, they're happily playing but

230
00:07:02,065 --> 00:07:04,533
it's kinda my thing,
superhero movies, so...

231
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,530
- [Ellie] Me too!

232
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,562
- I'm gonna go if that's okay.

233
00:07:07,562 --> 00:07:08,828
- I'll go again, that's good.

234
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,942
- I'll go see it twice.

235
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:11,340
Great idea, Ellie!

236
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,479
[Jared] You're the best thinker.

237
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,058
- So while the kids are
being good for a minute

238
00:07:15,058 --> 00:07:16,300
playing downstairs,

239
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,924
I am starting to go through
the thousands and thousands

240
00:07:19,924 --> 00:07:22,714
of pictures that we have
had over the last ten years.

241
00:07:22,714 --> 00:07:24,418
Making them into folders.

242
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:26,126
We have a 'Calvin' folder,

243
00:07:26,126 --> 00:07:27,546
we have a 'Calvin Baby' folder.

244
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:29,519
'Cousin' folder, 'friends',
'house', 'Jackson',

245
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,079
'Jackson Baby', 'Penny', 'pregnancy',

246
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:33,713
and I'm going through thousands of photos,

247
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:36,916
probably only a hundred while
the kids are somewhat happy.

248
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,038
And, putting them in the folders

249
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,506
so I can make these into a book.

250
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:44,101
And, I just wanted to
show you guys this picture

251
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,243
I put under 'pregnancy' and then

252
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,209
I put under 'family' as well.

253
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:49,925
And this photo was the
photo that Jarred and I

254
00:07:49,925 --> 00:07:52,723
talked about doing an IVF grant.

255
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,829
That is the time that we had talked about

256
00:07:54,829 --> 00:07:56,485
that we had wanted to do it.

257
00:07:56,485 --> 00:07:58,748
We didn't know if it would
be five years down the road,

258
00:07:58,748 --> 00:07:59,967
ten years down the road.

259
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,175
And now, looking back,

260
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:05,215
I had no idea that we would
be able to do two ourselves

261
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:08,689
in that amount of time
and I'm very grateful

262
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:11,592
and I'm glad that we are finally
going through these photos

263
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:14,859
and organizing them, and just
the memories that pop up.

264
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:17,036
Just, holy cow that seemed forever ago,

265
00:08:17,036 --> 00:08:19,635
and now I'm pregnant
with a little other baby.

266
00:08:19,635 --> 00:08:21,232
It's just like, what.

267
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:23,762
I couldn't imagine life with another baby,

268
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,835
It was just weird, it was
like Jackson's our everything

269
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:30,399
and then we had Calvin and our
love definitely multiplied.

270
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,265
We didn't have to divide our love.

271
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,860
It just, your love grows.

272
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:36,611
It's amazing how, how it does that.

273
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:37,865
I used to think,

274
00:08:37,865 --> 00:08:39,378
when it was just Jared and I,

275
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:40,567
I just thought "how am I gonna

276
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,071
love a baby as much as I love Jared?"

277
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:43,509
Like, I really thought that.

278
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,650
And, I knew, and I always felt at peace,

279
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,428
'cause it's like I know that like

280
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:49,381
you adjust and life is great.

281
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,414
But it was hard sometimes really,

282
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:52,546
thinking about that.

283
00:08:52,546 --> 00:08:54,538
But now that Jackson and Calvin are here

284
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:57,510
it's like, I love all three
of my boys equally as much.

285
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,008
Your love multiplies

286
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,569
and looking back at that photo is crazy.

287
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:03,677
So, it's gonna be fun going
through all of these photos,

288
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,448
I'm sure I'm gonna boo and cry.

289
00:09:05,448 --> 00:09:07,265
(screams) I just exited out of them!

290
00:09:07,265 --> 00:09:08,694
Jared just left.

291
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:10,474
As if I need to take any more pictures,

292
00:09:10,474 --> 00:09:12,205
because I've already
gone through two hundred

293
00:09:12,205 --> 00:09:14,148
and I still have thousands to go through.

294
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,703
I just spent a little bit
of time with the kids.

295
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:19,139
We played, read stories,
and they're in bed

296
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:21,397
talking a little bit
before they fall asleep.

297
00:09:21,397 --> 00:09:25,885
[Ellie] And of course,
they are happy as can be.

298
00:09:25,885 --> 00:09:28,491
And I was like "Calvin, go
put your head on your pillow!"

299
00:09:28,491 --> 00:09:30,495
And Jackson's like "no,
he likes to cuddle me."

300
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,288
I'm like "okay."

301
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:33,819
They go to bed so well.

302
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:36,012
Having our kids share a room

303
00:09:36,012 --> 00:09:39,082
has been the best thing
for the whole house.

304
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,234
And they have slept better,

305
00:09:41,234 --> 00:09:42,767
we have slept better.

306
00:09:42,767 --> 00:09:46,471
They go to bed happy and
they talk, and they laugh.

307
00:09:46,471 --> 00:09:48,935
It's just a fun experience.

308
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:51,551
I love sharing a room with my siblings,

309
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,492
and they won't always share a bed,

310
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:55,641
for sure I wanna get bunk beds.

311
00:09:55,641 --> 00:09:59,397
I just really wanted to make
sure this would work out.

312
00:09:59,397 --> 00:10:01,480
I would have hated to buy bunk beds

313
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,850
or even change up their room a little bit

314
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,799
and have Jackson be like
"no I don't love this"

315
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,670
or it be a hot mess.

316
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:11,100
But so far it's been so good.

317
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,905
I love our night time routine of cuddles

318
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:15,577
and hugs and reading books.

319
00:10:15,577 --> 00:10:18,178
I had someone come and we measured outside

320
00:10:18,178 --> 00:10:21,747
for some screens for in the
summer to put on the patio.

321
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,979
So I spent a lot of time this
afternoon outside measuring,

322
00:10:24,979 --> 00:10:27,691
making sure things would
fit and work out for that.

323
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:30,401
I'm gonna go continue
to go through pictures,

324
00:10:30,401 --> 00:10:33,560
I've been loving going
through the pregnancy photos

325
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,056
of me being pregnant
with Jackson and Calvin.

326
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:38,906
Just seeing, like, my body
change and my face change.

327
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:41,932
My thoughts when I was pregnant
then versus my thoughts now

328
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,841
and how I've changed as a
person it's been really fun

329
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:45,843
to, like, look back.

330
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:47,231
But I'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog.

331
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:49,241
Jared's on his date night.

332
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,967
I'm on my date night.

333
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:53,037
I ordered a sandwich.

334
00:10:53,037 --> 00:10:56,713
So, I'm eating my sandwich
and I'm getting ready for bed.

335
00:10:56,713 --> 00:10:59,098
So, I hope you guys had an awesome day.

336
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,996
We will see you guys tomorrow, bye.

337
00:11:01,996 --> 00:11:04,720
- You didn't think the vlog
was over just yet, did you?

338
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,259
My dad and I just got back

339
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:09,059
from seeing Black Panther,
and it was awesome.

340
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:12,001
I just left a tweet saying
my, like, short review.

341
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,688
Character development was great,

342
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,247
the new world was awesome.

343
00:11:15,247 --> 00:11:16,746
The villain vas really, really cool.

344
00:11:16,746 --> 00:11:19,815
The whole story was really, really great.

345
00:11:19,815 --> 00:11:21,210
Definitely recommend it.

346
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,991
There are some predictable
themes in the movie

347
00:11:22,991 --> 00:11:24,807
but I don't feel like that takes away

348
00:11:24,807 --> 00:11:28,080
from the overall quality and
awesomeness of the movie.

349
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,060
Definitely check out Black Panther.

350
00:11:30,060 --> 00:00:00,000
'Kay, thanks for watching, bye.
