1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:02,830
- I don't even know who he is anymore!

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:03,790
What?

3
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:04,750
What?

4
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,910
You're crazy!

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,868
- So Ellie thinks that this
is the right thing for me.

6
00:00:08,868 --> 00:00:09,701
- Shh.

7
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,150
Okay guys, I think that
we need to have a talk.

8
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,540
I am so in love with Jared.

9
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,600
He has always been there for me.

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,930
He's always been there for my family.

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,690
If something comes up,
he is there to help.

12
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,660
He is so good at, his calling at church,

13
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,420
everybody loves that he's energetic

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:31,990
and he's playful with the kids

15
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,590
and he just has the perfect personality

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,080
and the biggest heart

17
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,670
and he's always willing to
put others before himself,

18
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,310
but I have bene noticing some
changes with Jared lately

19
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:43,970
and I've been keeping my eye on him

20
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,820
and I feel like these
changes that he's been making

21
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,320
is not true to himself

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,060
and is really not true to us.

23
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,010
I'm in Jared's office

24
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,660
and I've noticed that this
is where most of his changes

25
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,690
have been happening.

26
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,390
And I just opened up his fridge

27
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,630
and no Dr. Pepper.

28
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,380
Zero calories, no sugar,

29
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,860
no artificial sweeteners?

30
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:04,950
What is this?

31
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,670
I'm not even sure that
I like these changes,

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,460
because it's not the Jared that I know

33
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,210
and it's starting to make me worried.

34
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,250
We have had four cases
of Dr. Pepper for weeks

35
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,939
and they haven't even moved.

36
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,648
(top popping)

37
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:19,300
I don't even know who he is anymore!

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,480
Jared has changed so much,

39
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,810
I don't even like looking
at his clothes anymore.

40
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,020
All of his free stupid t-shirts,

41
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,980
I want them gone!

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,630
These pants, he has had these pants

43
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,820
for four or five years.

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,950
He used to wear them every day in sales.

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,680
I want them gone, all of them,

46
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,770
I just want you to look nice!

47
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,610
I am not even mad.

48
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,443
He deserves this,

49
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:42,860
he's been changing right in front of me

50
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,400
and I'm throwing all of these out.

51
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,590
These are going.

52
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,497
Good bye.

53
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:50,580
("Mozart's Requiem")

54
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,140
in all seriousness, I love Jared,

55
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,290
I adore Jared and he
has been making changes.

56
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,940
Just small simple changes

57
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,410
lead to huge changes

58
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,688
and I've seen that with Jared.

59
00:02:04,688 --> 00:02:06,970
He's been working out in the mornings.

60
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,370
He's been waking up early,

61
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,830
getting videos, getting work done,

62
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,520
he's been trying to eat better.

63
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,150
I just can see a huge difference in Jared

64
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,690
and I'm very proud of him.

65
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,709
But I will say it is true,

66
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:20,130
a lot of the shirts that he wears

67
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,140
is the free t-shirts that he's got

68
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,980
and he even himself wants to vamp up

69
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,810
and I want to treat him
to a day of just Jared.

70
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,840
Let's go shopping,

71
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,740
I'm gonna give you tons
of clothes to try on,

72
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,570
even if you normally
wouldn't wear those clothes,

73
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,780
I want him just to have a day

74
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,670
where it's me and him,

75
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,503
we're gonna go to lunch,

76
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:40,900
we're gonna go shopping

77
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,310
and I love Jared and I'm proud of him.

78
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,970
So, with that said, shall we go?

79
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,173
I am proud of you.

80
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:48,270
- Thank you.

81
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,310
- I am proud.

82
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,200
Well the other day, so
I've been doing really good

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,960
at drinking water and
the other day I was like,

84
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,759
we should got to Swig and
get a cookie and a drink.

85
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:56,500
- You were having a craving.

86
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,170
- And so we went and got a drink

87
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,670
and we pulled away and I was like,

88
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,000
where's your drink and he was like,

89
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,849
I didn't get one and I was like, what?

90
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:06,682
What?

91
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:07,900
You're crazy!

92
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,150
- I skipped out on Swig.

93
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,300
I know, it's like the
craziest thing I've ever done.

94
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,740
You guys know I love Swig and
Dr. Pepper and all that stuff,

95
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,260
but by small and simple things

96
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,820
some great things come to pass, right?

97
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,653
- [Ellie] Yeah.

98
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:20,860
You look really different.

99
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,693
- Do I?

100
00:03:21,693 --> 00:03:22,526
- [Ellie] The lighting.

101
00:03:22,526 --> 00:03:23,438
- Oh, not like my shape.

102
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:24,271
(Ellie laughs)

103
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,250
- Where do you want to start Jared?

104
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,180
- Oh probably the beginning,

105
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,560
that seems like a very
good place to start.

106
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,393
- Okay, let's go.

107
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:31,150
- So Ellie thinks that this
is the right thing for me

108
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,110
and I am going to go along with it, but--

109
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,980
- [Ellie] Whatever, you are just as happy.

110
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,210
Shorts, pants, we'll see.

111
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,480
- We'll just have to see how this looks.

112
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,930
So you guys ready for
a little fashion show?

113
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,145
Starring me.

114
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:46,760
(lively music)

115
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,115
(dramatic music)

116
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,782
(playful music)

117
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,850
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

118
00:04:29,172 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm short.

119
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,913
I don't get it.

120
00:04:30,913 --> 00:04:33,540
Why are shirts, this is a sweater,

121
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,250
why does it only go to my belt?

122
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,370
If I wash this,

123
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,840
that is not flattering at all,

124
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,630
no one wants to see this.

125
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,940
Why do companies do this?

126
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,730
I'm short and this is a medium.

127
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,290
I don't get it, am I
missing something here?

128
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,650
Like am I missing something?

129
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,840
Something?
- It's the story of our lives.

130
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,970
- It's not even a good one.

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,030
- [Ellie] Progress.

132
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,830
- Aaaay.

133
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,540
I like this a lot.
- You look crisp.

134
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,360
- I like this a lot Ellie.

135
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,890
- [Ellie] Well you look ravishing.

136
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,446
Woo hoo.

137
00:05:03,446 --> 00:05:04,279
- Do I look pretty good?

138
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,112
- [Ellie] Yeah.

139
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:05,945
- I think these are a little
too wide at the bottom.

140
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:07,290
- [Ellie] Ready for church.

141
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,440
Yeah.
- But I like it.

142
00:05:09,466 --> 00:05:12,633
(gentle guitar music)

143
00:05:16,076 --> 00:05:16,954
- [Ellie] Crazy huh?

144
00:05:16,954 --> 00:05:17,787
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

145
00:05:17,787 --> 00:05:18,620
- [Ellie] Four months.

146
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,525
- [Jared] I still can't
believe you're pregnant.

147
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:23,340
(Jared laughs)

148
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,780
- [Ellie] Kids are so fun to shop for

149
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,623
and Jared.

150
00:05:27,623 --> 00:05:28,456
- Oh thank you.

151
00:05:28,456 --> 00:05:31,410
- If you guys want to smell
like a baby's bottom, Tom Ford.

152
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,660
Even the sales associate agreed.

153
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,878
- It's like baby powder.

154
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:35,711
(laughs)

155
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,544
- No.

156
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,470
- Hey, here's a trophy you earned it.

157
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,443
Or would you rather have the bulge.

158
00:05:40,443 --> 00:05:41,680
(Ellie laughs)

159
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,040
Palate has been cleansed.

160
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,750
- [Ellie] Get scratchin' and sniffin'.

161
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:47,972
- This is good.

162
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:48,990
- [Ellie] That's my favorite.

163
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,613
- Smell me.

164
00:05:55,075 --> 00:05:55,908
You like it?

165
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:56,741
- [Ellie] I do.

166
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:59,324
(bright music)

167
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,450
- Okay, so today is
actually a very special day,

168
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,270
not just because of what
Ellie and I did earlier,

169
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,300
but because today is
the two year anniversary

170
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,740
of my parents living in Utah.

171
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,800
And it's a very exciting night

172
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,950
and it's something that they actually

173
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,970
invited us to dinner to.

174
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:20,050
And they told us, while
we were in Salt Lake,

175
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:22,430
we are wearing nice clothing,

176
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,910
so just an FYI.

177
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,910
Ellie already looks amazing with her coat

178
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,940
and sweater and everything--

179
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,030
- [Ellie] Good thing we
just bought you clothes.

180
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,350
- and we just bought me clothes,

181
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,410
so I am in the back seat

182
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,780
and I'm looking through all the clothes

183
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,720
that I just got.
- This looks nice.

184
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,110
- This sweater, right there?

185
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,650
That looks nice with that jacket?

186
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,580
I've got some slacks,

187
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,890
I've got these slacks I'm gonna wear.

188
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,790
So I hope Mom and Dad are okay with this,

189
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:45,810
because I probably would've
dressed nicer had I known,

190
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:48,820
but we're about to go
into a very sweet dinner

191
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,910
with my Mom and Dad.

192
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,130
It's snowing like crazy right now.

193
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:52,963
You can't really tell.

194
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:55,650
And it's like, anticlimactic,

195
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,770
but it's snowing a lot.

196
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:59,110
Alright, before we get any
further in this dinner,

197
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,910
Dad has some rules about the table

198
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,743
that we're gonna go over.

199
00:07:02,743 --> 00:07:03,576
- Every electronic's going in the bag.

200
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:04,560
- Yeah my watch just went off.

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,330
What are the other rules Dad?

202
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,163
- Phones off.

203
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:07,996
- [Jared] Yes.

204
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,050
- And you can have whatever's
on the menu you want,

205
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,517
like anything.
- Oh my gosh.

206
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,490
- Anything.
- Anything?

207
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,290
- So that's including food.

208
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,950
We can get whatever food we want.

209
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:20,783
- Of course.

210
00:07:20,783 --> 00:07:21,616
- [Jared] Okay, alright.

211
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:23,683
- No unlimited amount of Dr. Pepper.

212
00:07:23,683 --> 00:07:24,516
(Jared sighs)

213
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,720
- Don't worry, I have been
doing good with that, haven't I?

214
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,350
I know I haven't been loyal.

215
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,450
I feel like I've missed you all day

216
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,080
my sweet Penny girl.

217
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,760
You have been such a good girl.

218
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,650
And I feel like I've missed you guys.

219
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,960
I haven't been really a huge part,

220
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,030
well I guess a huge part,

221
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,810
but I haven't talked to you today.

222
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,370
And I feel like that's been missing.

223
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,970
But I just wanted to say how much

224
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,510
I enjoyed today.

225
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,110
Ellie and I are trying to work hard

226
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,628
on doing a date night once a week

227
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:53,750
and I feel like today
totally counts for that.

228
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,830
Especially that we were able

229
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,580
to get to spend some time with my parents.

230
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,970
And this has been two years
since they moved to Utah.

231
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:03,960
I cannot believe that over two years ago,

232
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,110
we went to Spokane and
helped them move here.

233
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,230
Like that blows my mind,

234
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,680
because it feels like
it was just yesterday,

235
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,798
especially all of the
siblings getting together

236
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:15,470
and saying goodbye to our house

237
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,940
that we grew up in.

238
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,860
It was so cool.

239
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,470
I love that my parents are here.

240
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,100
I feel like they're our neighbors

241
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,920
and I love that our
kids, Jackson and Calvin,

242
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,260
love that Grandma and Grandpa are here,

243
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,810
that's the coolest thing to me.

244
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,360
And I'm so grateful that they're here,

245
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,850
and I'm so grateful that they have enjoyed

246
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,770
living next to us,

247
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,730
because I don't know, maybe
sometimes we're not the greatest

248
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:36,750
neighbors in the whole entire world.

249
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,607
Maybe we are, I don't know,

250
00:08:38,607 --> 00:08:39,969
We'll let them be the judge of that.

251
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,580
- Today was a great day.

252
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,413
Cheers.

253
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:43,246
- [Jared] Cheers.

254
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:44,078
- Let's go to bed and watch a show.

255
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:44,950
- [Jared] Absolutely.

256
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,870
Ending our night the best
way that we know how,

257
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,870
with a little Flash.

258
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,310
No, not that kind of Flash, Ellie, no.

259
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,120
Like a little Barry Allen,
the fastest man alive.

260
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,880
Anyway guys, thanks so much for watching.

261
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,140
