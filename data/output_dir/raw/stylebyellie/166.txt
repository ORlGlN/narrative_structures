1
00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:03,034
(bright music)

2
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:26,937
- You about ready?

3
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:28,020
- I am ready.

4
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,249
Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:31,906
- Good morning, I hope you
brought your learning hat,

6
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:34,018
because we're gonna get
some learning on today.

7
00:00:34,018 --> 00:00:34,851
- Good.

8
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:35,684
I hope so.

9
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,253
- As if puzzles weren't
hard enough already,

10
00:00:41,253 --> 00:00:44,613
I decided to throw another
challenge into the mix.

11
00:00:44,613 --> 00:00:48,363
This puzzle that I got,
it's like reflecting.

12
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:52,655
So it's kind of like weird,
it has a weird effect to it,

13
00:00:52,655 --> 00:00:55,260
I don't know if the
camera's picking it up.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,765
But that's what I'm
putting together today.

15
00:00:57,765 --> 00:00:59,217
I saw this at the store the other day,

16
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:02,240
and thought, this captures
my emotions perfectly.

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,792
I'm gonna get it, and I'm
gonna put it together.

18
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:08,042
And it's gonna be a challenge, but fun.

19
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,440
(applause)

20
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,140
- And in real life, he
brings so much energy

21
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,313
so come fully prepared to learn.

22
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:24,056
Completely open mind,
whatever he's talking about,

23
00:01:24,056 --> 00:01:26,224
it will relate back to your business

24
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:27,921
that you're building,

25
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,585
so just keep that in mind seriously.

26
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:32,122
- [Presenter] And then you can start

27
00:01:32,122 --> 00:01:33,650
branching out from there,

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,672
and then your CPM's can get less views,

29
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:37,520
and make more money that way.

30
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,020
- He's in trouble.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,193
- Hi Jared.

32
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:43,511
- We love you and your
family and your kids.

33
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:44,344
(bell dings)

34
00:01:44,344 --> 00:01:45,533
- And I really miss Ellie.

35
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:46,574
- You went to the bathroom

36
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:47,407
(bell dings)

37
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,595
and so we took your camera.

38
00:01:48,595 --> 00:01:49,659
And we just wanted to tell you

39
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:51,097
that we really miss you already,

40
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:52,614
'cause you just went to the bathroom.

41
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:53,447
- But I really miss Ellie.

42
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,209
(bell dings)

43
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:56,458
and everybody else.

44
00:01:56,458 --> 00:02:00,194
- That's right and don't fall
asleep while you're editing.

45
00:02:00,194 --> 00:02:01,851
(bell dings)

46
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:02,684
- So one of the main events today

47
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:04,508
is a keynote speech by Gary V.

48
00:02:04,508 --> 00:02:05,556
And he's about to come out.

49
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:08,402
Shonduras is giving him
an introduction right now.

50
00:02:08,402 --> 00:02:10,052
And I think everyone's
gonna be going crazy.

51
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:11,152
- Gary V, guys.

52
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:14,485
(applause and cheering)

53
00:02:17,274 --> 00:02:18,706
Gary, welcome to the stage.

54
00:02:18,706 --> 00:02:21,728
- [Ellie] This puzzle
should have come with Advil.

55
00:02:21,728 --> 00:02:25,003
Look at the pieces, every
time I look for a piece,

56
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:26,559
they all move (laughs).

57
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:28,110
- Ladies and gentlemen,
here is Bryan Lanning

58
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,353
in front of a green screen.

59
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:31,510
You can put whatever you
want behind him right now.

60
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,118
Download this footage.

61
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:34,950
Put him underwater, put him on the moon,

62
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,350
it's up to you.

63
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:40,135
Put him on stage, oh not
in the dungeon, oh no.

64
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,302
- Which one does this one?

65
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,082
- That's a hard one, huh?

66
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,735
I'm having a hard time.

67
00:02:46,735 --> 00:02:47,874
- Yeah.

68
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:48,791
- You know?

69
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:52,720
- Yeah, can I watch YouTube?

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,564
- Can you put together
my puzzle using that?

71
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:57,397
- This?

72
00:02:57,397 --> 00:03:00,700
- Mmm-mmm, just put it together,

73
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,033
push a button and it'll put it together?

74
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,851
It's not working.

75
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,684
- Huh?

76
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:09,667
- It's not working.

77
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,149
- Why is it not working?

78
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:11,982
- I don't know.

79
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,216
Maybe it just works for the TV.

80
00:03:13,216 --> 00:03:16,995
- Okay, so I had lunch in the same room,

81
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:18,405
I didn't have lunch with him, with Gary V,

82
00:03:18,405 --> 00:03:20,148
who just did the keynote, right?

83
00:03:20,148 --> 00:03:21,847
- He was pretty awesome.

84
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:23,073
- It was pretty great, yeah.

85
00:03:23,073 --> 00:03:25,034
But so I went and got a picture with him,

86
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:26,154
the picture's right here,

87
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,403
and then we shook hands.

88
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:29,108
And I want to tell you
about when we shook hands.

89
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,798
Don't laugh, it's serious business.

90
00:03:30,798 --> 00:03:33,394
- What happened, Jared what happened?

91
00:03:33,394 --> 00:03:35,018
- Did you hold him for too long?

92
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:35,851
- [Jared] No.

93
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:36,684
- Were your hands sweaty?

94
00:03:36,684 --> 00:03:38,846
- No, it was the most magical handshake

95
00:03:38,846 --> 00:03:39,679
I've ever had.

96
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,512
- [Bryan] What?

97
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,345
- And I'll tell you exactly why.

98
00:03:41,345 --> 00:03:44,091
So I reached out my hand like this,

99
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,091
and when we shook hands,

100
00:03:47,301 --> 00:03:49,249
the crease in my hand right there,

101
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:52,794
and his crease just met up perfectly

102
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:55,951
and our hands clasped at the same time,

103
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:58,255
and everything was just
like in the perfect sync.

104
00:03:58,255 --> 00:03:59,858
- [Jinger] Are you in love?

105
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:03,628
- Well I was in love with that handshake.

106
00:04:03,628 --> 00:04:04,576
It was the best handshake I've

107
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:06,043
- The best handshake you've ever had.

108
00:04:06,043 --> 00:04:08,078
- Absolutely, without
even thinking about it.

109
00:04:08,078 --> 00:04:10,025
- Not like number two or number three.

110
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,378
That's a big deal Jared,
that's a really big deal.

111
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,074
- I'm so glad you're documenting this,

112
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:14,907
because you might forget.

113
00:04:14,907 --> 00:04:17,317
- No it was a good handshake.

114
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:20,213
There's some important
thinks about a handshake.

115
00:04:20,214 --> 00:04:22,848
And like, so it wasn't like
a Donald Trump handshake.

116
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,655
You know like the

117
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:26,302
- Yeah yeah.
- Yeah it wasn't like that.

118
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:27,375
- [Carl] Yeah, the choo choo train.

119
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,208
- Yeah exactly, the choo choo train.

120
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,403
- The choo choo train.

121
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:32,659
- Yeah, it was like a nice fit,

122
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,785
a firm squeeze and a

123
00:04:34,785 --> 00:04:37,366
- It's like slipping
your hand into a glove.

124
00:04:37,366 --> 00:04:38,669
- It's like a gentleman's handshake.

125
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:39,748
- [Jared] Exactly, yeah exactly.

126
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,611
This guy behind us is
like what in the heck

127
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:42,675
are you guys talking about.

128
00:04:42,675 --> 00:04:44,698
(laughing)

129
00:04:44,698 --> 00:04:45,739
- The best thing in the world

130
00:04:45,739 --> 00:04:48,387
is ordering food so it comes to your door,

131
00:04:48,387 --> 00:04:50,212
and sitting and watching movies all day

132
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:51,982
and that's just what I've been doing.

133
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:55,405
Worked on my puzzle, my
friend here, hi Whitney.

134
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,855
And all of our kids are outside playing.

135
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:01,835
And I love that Penny is just so happy

136
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,310
that everyone's out there.

137
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,966
Like she's just laying
and chewing on her bone.

138
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,671
But food is gonna be here soon,

139
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:09,170
I'm gonna stop talking,

140
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:11,663
'cause it's annoying to listen
to someone talk like this,

141
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:13,789
and I don't want to talk
when I sound like this,

142
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,005
so we're just gonna eat food

143
00:05:15,005 --> 00:05:16,701
and enjoy the rest of our day.

144
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,701
(chill funky music)

145
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:24,438
(airplane rumbling)

146
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:26,083
- We're done with our
classes at VidSummit today

147
00:05:26,083 --> 00:05:27,126
and we're out to dinner.

148
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:27,972
We've got the whole crew here.

149
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,190
I'm hanging out with my dad.

150
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,156
Of course, I'm hanging out with my dad.

151
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:32,496
But we've got the whole crew,

152
00:05:32,496 --> 00:05:35,213
Corbin, Carl, Jinger, Missy came to town.

153
00:05:35,213 --> 00:05:36,046
- Hi.

154
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:36,879
- And Bryan,

155
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,567
and honestly, we're at the steakhouse

156
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:42,384
and I feel a little awkward filming here,

157
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:45,281
because it's like a nice place.

158
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,114
- And I'm gonna eat a whole one.

159
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:47,664
- I was just about to say maybe I feel

160
00:05:47,664 --> 00:05:48,839
a little bit less awkward now.

161
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,614
(laughing)

162
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:53,974
Thanks for always making
me feel comfortable

163
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:55,269
in these situations.

164
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,920
This is the strangest
bacon I've ever seen,

165
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,723
but it's the most amazing
bacon I've ever seen.

166
00:05:58,723 --> 00:05:59,556
- [Bryan] Amazing.

167
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,010
- [Jared] Look how thick that bacon is,

168
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,474
it's a half a fork thick.

169
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:04,989
- [Bryan] And it comes in a maple glaze.

170
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:05,822
It's incredible.

171
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:06,904
- [Jared] It is so good.

172
00:06:06,904 --> 00:06:08,321
Dinner is served.

173
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,979
Holy cow Dad.

174
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,386
How much of the cow did you want?

175
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:16,594
- No kidding, I think
that's at least half of it.

176
00:06:16,594 --> 00:06:17,641
(laughing)

177
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:19,102
- Are you ready for this Dad?

178
00:06:19,102 --> 00:06:19,935
- I don't know.

179
00:06:19,935 --> 00:06:21,682
- Do you think you can handle the course?

180
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:22,762
- [Dad] I don't know.

181
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,408
- They're going pretty quick.

182
00:06:24,408 --> 00:06:25,241
It's like a slick track,

183
00:06:25,241 --> 00:06:28,269
they're like sliding all over the place.

184
00:06:28,269 --> 00:06:29,102
This is sweet.

185
00:06:29,102 --> 00:06:29,935
I hope we get to race.

186
00:06:29,935 --> 00:06:30,768
There's a lot of people,

187
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:31,601
so we may not get an opportunity

188
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,871
to race on the track,

189
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,275
because of all the people here,

190
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,275
but I'm crossing our fingers for us.

191
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,746
Is my hair okay?

192
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,103
- [Bryan] Good luck buddy.

193
00:06:42,103 --> 00:06:45,103
(chill funky music)

194
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:49,119
(race cars sliding)

195
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:51,869
(skid squealing)

196
00:07:05,108 --> 00:07:06,286
- So bad, I felt so bad,

197
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,286
but that was crazy, fun.

198
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:10,604
Did it look cool?

199
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:11,437
- It was awesome.

200
00:07:11,437 --> 00:07:12,531
- Okay, you're up next, man.

201
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:14,198
Come on Mario Karts.

202
00:07:16,609 --> 00:07:18,212
Woo, oh.

203
00:07:18,212 --> 00:07:20,868
(Jared laughs)

204
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:23,618
(skid squealing)

205
00:07:27,977 --> 00:07:31,060
(race cars motoring)

206
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:42,193
So Jinger has been talking smack all day

207
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:46,465
about how she is going to
crush everyone at racing today.

208
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:49,701
And let's just say, I'm not
sure that's gonna happen.

209
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:51,090
(laughing)

210
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,835
Corbin comin' out of nowhere,

211
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,412
pressuring, pressuring Carl.

212
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:58,745
Alright, the results are in.

213
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:00,817
- Are they?

214
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:02,001
- [Jared] Yes, who do you think one?

215
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,922
- I don't know.
- Not me.

216
00:08:03,922 --> 00:08:04,755
- Yes!

217
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,485
- No no!

218
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:09,479
- Wait, he's joking.

219
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:10,312
- [Jared] Corbin!

220
00:08:10,312 --> 00:08:11,145
- Yeah!

221
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:14,208
- I was like, no way.

222
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,868
- [Jared] It was really
close Carl, you got second.

223
00:08:16,868 --> 00:08:17,723
- Right at the end.

224
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:18,679
- Yeah, how was it man?

225
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,080
- It was amazing.

226
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,712
I felt good, like nobody passed me

227
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:22,735
and I was pushing the limits.

228
00:08:22,735 --> 00:08:25,035
- You were in first place
for like half the race.

229
00:08:25,035 --> 00:08:26,364
- Did you have a lot of fun?

230
00:08:26,364 --> 00:08:28,440
- I had an amazing time,
this was so awesome.

231
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,316
- That's good to hear.

232
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:31,492
- Yes sir.

233
00:08:31,492 --> 00:08:34,030
- I had a really great time.

234
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,249
- Make sure to slam on
some strike balm guys.

235
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,083
- Slammo!

236
00:08:39,162 --> 00:08:41,780
- I'm not sure what to do with my hands.

237
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,153
- We're gonna get a big
group picture over here.

238
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:46,972
- Alright scrunch in,
like we're all gonna fit

239
00:08:46,972 --> 00:08:48,889
right here, load it up.

240
00:08:50,957 --> 00:08:53,957
(chill funky music)

241
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,695
- Oh Jinger, what

242
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,303
What place did you get?

243
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:03,191
- Oh third, but what was your time Jared,

244
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:04,255
I'm really interested.

245
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,222
- 31.1.

246
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:06,665
- Oh really?

247
00:09:06,665 --> 00:09:07,802
31.3.

248
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:08,635
- Ooh.

249
00:09:08,635 --> 00:09:10,907
- That really hurts my ego.

250
00:09:10,907 --> 00:09:11,740
- Sorry about that.

251
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,056
- Rematch coming right up.

252
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:16,431
- Alright, you name the
place, you name the time,

253
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,463
I'll be there.

254
00:09:17,463 --> 00:09:19,151
- Oh oh.
- I'll beat you fair.

255
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:20,359
- And square.
- What?

256
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,970
- What a day, what a day indeed.

257
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,793
My mind is full of new information

258
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:29,360
and my body is tired from
acquiring that information.

259
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,617
So it's time to end the vlog.

260
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:32,042
