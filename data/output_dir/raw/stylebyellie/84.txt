1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,585
- [Ellie] I do not like
to overline my lips.

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:05,296
The day after Christmas
they take their tree down.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:06,313
That's kinda sad.

4
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:08,047
(laughing)

5
00:00:08,047 --> 00:00:08,880
Is that better?

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,737
Excuse me, mam, I was here.
- [Bonnie] Hello.

7
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:12,570
- [Jared] Say yeah!

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,403
- [All Together] Yeah!

9
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:16,858
- [Jared] So, you're probably wondering,

10
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,222
what do you Ellie and Jared
and Bonnie and Joel do

11
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:20,680
when they're hanging out?

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,513
How you doing?

13
00:00:21,513 --> 00:00:23,120
(laughing drowns out speech)

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,287
- [Ellie] Are we all situated?
Okay, close your eyes.

15
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,060
What! Jared's out and about

16
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,509
and the kids and I got
the hot tub this morning

17
00:00:36,509 --> 00:00:39,646
and it was so fun to play and swim around.

18
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:43,602
And, I told them, I said,
"if we all take naps

19
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:47,041
when we wake up we're gonna
see our cousins today."

20
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,686
And, the kids woke up, like,
five o'clock this morning

21
00:00:50,686 --> 00:00:54,448
to play with toys and
so they are so tired.

22
00:00:54,448 --> 00:00:57,401
Usually, this is not like
them to just lie down,

23
00:00:57,401 --> 00:01:00,285
but Calvin was like, "Okay, I'm tired."

24
00:01:00,285 --> 00:01:03,116
And, they love those! People
have asked where we got 'em.

25
00:01:03,116 --> 00:01:06,454
I don't know. I wish so bad
that I knew where we got 'em.

26
00:01:06,454 --> 00:01:11,115
They were given to us when
Jared was doing a presentation

27
00:01:11,115 --> 00:01:15,102
and someone gave them to us. We love them!

28
00:01:15,102 --> 00:01:17,893
But, the kids are situated.
I'm gonna take a snooze

29
00:01:17,893 --> 00:01:20,120
and lay down and then
we'll see our cousins

30
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,953
and we'll play later.

31
00:01:20,953 --> 00:01:23,890
- [Jared] Hello. How are you?
Good morning, good morning.

32
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,161
Editing Jared, here. I've
been editing like crazy

33
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,038
and I have some good news for you.

34
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,416
If you head on over to Ellie's channel

35
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:34,476
you will see a brand new
video, and that brand new video

36
00:01:34,476 --> 00:01:37,251
is all about what we got for Christmas.

37
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:41,168
Yes. Me, Ellie, Jackson,
Calvin and even Penny;

38
00:01:42,282 --> 00:01:43,933
what we got for Christmas.

39
00:01:43,933 --> 00:01:46,643
Even some things that we
didn't show in the vlog.

40
00:01:46,643 --> 00:01:49,019
I'll have a link to it down
in the description down below

41
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,479
for you guys to check out.

42
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,706
Head on over to here channel.
I think its a fun video,

43
00:01:52,706 --> 00:01:53,835
I think you will love it.

44
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:56,410
If you do head on over there,
let us know you enjoyed it

45
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,684
by giving it big thumbs up and thank you

46
00:01:58,684 --> 00:01:59,827
so much for watching it.

47
00:01:59,827 --> 00:02:03,783
- [Ellie] The kids taking
naps was a success.

48
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:06,342
When I get ready into my makeup,

49
00:02:06,342 --> 00:02:09,309
a lot of times I'll do
a few drops of this.

50
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:12,750
I've talked about this before,
its the Pure Hydrafluid.

51
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,346
The brand is Pure and I get it from Ulta.

52
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:17,755
I mix a little bit with my foundation

53
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:21,957
because sometimes I feel
like when I do my foundation

54
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:25,943
and even add blush and stuff,
I just look really pale,

55
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:27,830
and that adds a little bit of color to it.

56
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,486
But. Today I feel like I
added a little too much.

57
00:02:30,486 --> 00:02:33,057
I don't know if you guys can tell

58
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:37,648
but my face is quite a
bit darker than my neck.

59
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:38,943
I don't know if you can tell.

60
00:02:38,943 --> 00:02:41,744
So, I have a ton of makeup
on and I do feel kinda gross

61
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,604
but Jared got me these two
lipsticks for Christmas

62
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:49,985
and I didn't really
look at them very close.

63
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:53,315
But, this one, actually,
is like a deep pink

64
00:02:53,315 --> 00:02:55,088
and that's a true red.

65
00:02:55,088 --> 00:02:59,750
So, hopefully you can tell
the top one right here,

66
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,417
that's true red; and right here,

67
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:08,546
is like a fuchsia deep pink.

68
00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:12,546
So, I think I'm going to
do the deep pink today.

69
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:16,013
I always put chap stick on
and wipe the foundation off

70
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:18,252
because I get foundation on my lips

71
00:03:18,252 --> 00:03:19,409
but when you wear a matte lipstick

72
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,594
you really wanna make sure
it's nice and moisturized.

73
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:24,735
We need a new camera, so bad!

74
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:27,269
That's what we should've got
for Christmas is a camera

75
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,186
because the focus has
been so unbelievably bad.

76
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,483
Uh-huh, oh baby!

77
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,380
(mellow music)

78
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:43,588
I do not like to overline my lips

79
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:45,380
but it was pretty close this time.

80
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,594
Okay, I'll fix that part in a minute.

81
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,844
Someone just rang the door.

82
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:53,248
What's up, Jacks?

83
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,405
- [Jackson] There's someone at the door.

84
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:57,230
- [Ellie] Okay, just answer it.

85
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,063
- [Jackson] Okay.

86
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,247
- [Ellie] I'll come. Okay, gotta go.

87
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:02,486
I love the color, it looks so good.

88
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:05,804
I did mess up right
there. I gotta fix that

89
00:04:05,804 --> 00:04:09,163
but I'm gonna finish getting ready

90
00:04:09,163 --> 00:04:11,957
because we are gonna go out tonight.

91
00:04:11,957 --> 00:04:14,374
Ta-da! There I am, all ready.

92
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:19,016
Why are you laughing?
Are you laughing at me?

93
00:04:19,016 --> 00:04:20,182
(laughing)

94
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:22,576
Today, I thought we can play one more day

95
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:24,410
or we can clean up the house.

96
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,646
I've seen a lot of people on Instagram

97
00:04:25,646 --> 00:04:28,484
the day after Christmas
they take their tree down.

98
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:30,998
That's kinda sad. I wasn't
gonna take the tree down

99
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:33,117
but I was wondering if I should
put their toys in their room

100
00:04:33,117 --> 00:04:37,209
or organize the toys and I
thought lets play one more day

101
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:38,840
and tomorrow when we wake up

102
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,153
we will clean and organize
and put stuff away.

103
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:44,374
Hey, how come you look
so cool in that outfit?

104
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:46,556
- [Jared] He wants to kiss you so bad!

105
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:48,378
(laughing)

106
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:49,820
- [Ellie] Is that better?

107
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,181
(laughing)

108
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,740
Mr Kissing McGee, you look so cute.

109
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,907
- [Jared] Duh!

110
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:57,986
Hey!

111
00:04:57,986 --> 00:05:00,860
- [Ellie] Excuse me, mam, I was here.

112
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,178
- [Bonnie] No, I think...

113
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,275
- [Ellie] Mam, you brought you're baby,

114
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:08,291
you're gonna have to pay
for that? That ticket?

115
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,327
- [Jared] Thanks for asking, I'm good.

116
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:11,441
- [Ellie] He's helping
him zip up his coat.

117
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,668
(crowd noise)

118
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:17,332
- [Bonnie] Hiya! You little...

119
00:05:17,332 --> 00:05:19,582
(laughing)

120
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:23,129
- [Ellie] Boo!

121
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:26,712
(film plays in background)

122
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:34,960
- [Ellie] Jackson insisted on
sitting next to Aunt Bonnie.

123
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,279
- [Jared] Between Bonnie and Boston.

124
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,624
- [Ellie] We are dancing
our way out, woohoo!

125
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:44,124
Was that fun? Did you love it?

126
00:05:45,944 --> 00:05:46,886
- [Jared] It was so good.

127
00:05:46,886 --> 00:05:48,599
- [Ellie] That was so funny.

128
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:49,558
- [Jared] Scoot back.

129
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:50,391
- [Jackson] We watched this movie!

130
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,814
- [Ellie] We did, did you like it?

131
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:52,647
- (Jackson] Yeah.

132
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,392
- [Ellie] Hey, I even offered
to give Bonnie a liquorice

133
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:57,943
and she said no. So, if you
watch her video you'll no why.

134
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,702
- [Bonnie] Calvin, come here.
- [Ellie] Right here, Cal.

135
00:05:59,702 --> 00:06:00,683
- [Bonnie] Let's take your picture.

136
00:06:00,683 --> 00:06:03,016
Can you look at Aunt Bonnie?

137
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:06,936
- [Ellie] Did you love the movie?

138
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:07,779
- [Jared] Say yeah!

139
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,093
- [All Together] Yeah!

140
00:06:09,093 --> 00:06:11,105
- [Bonnie] 1, 2, 3, crazy face!

141
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,400
- [Jared] Say oompah loompah!

142
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,060
- [Bonnie] Cody or Boston. Look at me

143
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,915
and give me a crazy face.

144
00:06:16,915 --> 00:06:18,517
- [Ellie] Crazy face.

145
00:06:18,517 --> 00:06:19,365
- [Bonnie] Right here.

146
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:23,532
(Ellie makes ringing sound with tongue)

147
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,447
- [Ellie] Well, I hope you guys
liked Christmas break, ah...

148
00:06:28,447 --> 00:06:30,433
- [Bonnie] I don't think
we've ever been successful at

149
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,763
taking our kids' pictures.

150
00:06:31,763 --> 00:06:34,013
(laughing)

151
00:06:34,898 --> 00:06:35,856
- [Jackson] Bonnie.

152
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:36,689
- [Bonnie] What?

153
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:40,671
- [Jackson] Can we come to your house?

154
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,767
- [Ellie] It's getting
close to bed time, honey.

155
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,175
- [Young girl] I loved
when the bowl was the tree

156
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:47,377
because it was electric so
I could turn on the lights.

157
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:49,401
- [Ellie] That was the
best. That was so funny

158
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:50,234
we laughed hard.

159
00:06:50,234 --> 00:06:53,142
- [Jared] Sorry guys,
but we ditched the kids.

160
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,321
Hi, how's it going?
- [Bonnie] Hey!

161
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,950
- [Jared] We, after our movie,
were like we don't really

162
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,854
wanna stop hanging out
so let's get a babysitter

163
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,164
and that's what were doing right now.

164
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,848
- [Ellie] Bonnie is always
so good and gets sitters

165
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:07,670
when the kids go to bed
and come to our house

166
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,402
so its our turn to come over here.

167
00:07:09,402 --> 00:07:12,066
- [Bonnie] I know and I love
when we go over our head and

168
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:15,032
this is the best part of it.
- [Jared] And we brought food.

169
00:07:15,032 --> 00:07:18,958
Everything we do involves
hanging out and eating food,

170
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:22,940
so and another tradition
that Joel is beginning to do

171
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:27,107
is looking at razors. So, I
like that quite a bit, so.

172
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:29,380
- [Bonnie] It's a nice pastime.

173
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,387
- [Jared] Yeah, great. So...

174
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:33,356
- [Joel] Just, starts an
addiction so that's good.

175
00:07:33,356 --> 00:07:35,134
- [Jared] Why don't we get one?

176
00:07:35,134 --> 00:07:37,458
- [Joel] Not soon enough.
- [Jared] Okay.

177
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:38,686
- [Jared] So, you're probably wondering

178
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:41,354
what do Jared and Ellie
and Bonnie and Joel do

179
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:42,794
when they're hanging out.

180
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:45,056
This is like behind the
scenes. What we actually do

181
00:07:45,056 --> 00:07:46,569
real time.
- [Ellie] What we do

182
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,151
with you see us, anyway.

183
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:52,196
- [Jared] Yeah. Is we're literally
just sitting on the couch

184
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:53,805
we have some Swedish Fish.

185
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,800
- [Bonnie] Some! A five
pound bag and we plan

186
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,439
on eating all of it.

187
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,956
- [Jared] How much is left in there?

188
00:07:59,956 --> 00:08:01,607
Yeah, there's like, um...

189
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,908
(Jared makes robotic noise)

190
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:08,079
There it is! And we're
watching Dude Perfect.

191
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,566
And, we have been for
probably the last hour.

192
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,076
So...
- [Ellie] It's pretty sweet.

193
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,078
- [Jared] Our life is
pretty amazing, I know.

194
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,182
I know you guys are jealous, I know.

195
00:08:17,182 --> 00:08:18,500
- [Ellie] You know, I've never watched him

196
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,031
but Bonnie and Joel do and
I think it's really fun.

197
00:08:21,031 --> 00:08:22,473
- [Jared] Dude Perfect's freakin' awesome.

198
00:08:22,473 --> 00:08:23,306
- [Bonnie] I'm obsessed.

199
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:25,330
- [Jared] They've been one of
the channels that I've watched

200
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,555
from the beginning, yeah.

201
00:08:27,555 --> 00:08:29,022
- [Bonnie] Devon Supertramp.
- [Jared] Devon supertramp

202
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,714
right there, too, yeah. What's that?

203
00:08:30,714 --> 00:08:31,918
- [Joel] I taught him everything I know.

204
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:33,594
- [Jared] Did you, really?

205
00:08:33,594 --> 00:08:35,552
- [Joel] I did it so good.
- [Jared] Yeah.

206
00:08:35,552 --> 00:08:36,643
I don't know how they got there.

207
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:39,702
Well, now I do. You taught them.

208
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:42,809
So, that's what we're
doing on Wednesday night.

209
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,288
Is today Wednesday? It is Wednesday.

210
00:08:45,288 --> 00:08:50,273
10pm. We're watching Dude
Perfect and eating Swedish Fish.

211
00:08:50,273 --> 00:08:51,242
How you doing?

212
00:08:51,242 --> 00:08:52,593
(laughing drowns out speech)

213
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:54,862
I'm editing right now
and I am Pulling In Jared

214
00:08:54,862 --> 00:08:56,958
so I think that means we
have to call it a night.
