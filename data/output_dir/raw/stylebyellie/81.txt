1
00:00:00,128 --> 00:00:01,607
- Well good golly, it's only nine o'clock

2
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:04,838
in the morning and our plans
have changed 800 times.

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,861
Let's go to St. George and have a party.

4
00:00:06,861 --> 00:00:07,907
Our friends are sick,

5
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:09,811
um, let's got to Deer Valley.

6
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:12,163
Everything's too expensive to rent.

7
00:00:12,163 --> 00:00:13,835
Let's just stay home.

8
00:00:13,835 --> 00:00:16,099
That's boring, let's
go back to St. George.

9
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,427
So we found an awesome place in St. George

10
00:00:19,427 --> 00:00:20,979
that we are going to.

11
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,506
The kids were so sad this morning

12
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,406
when we're like, we're not going

13
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:26,478
and now they're very
excited that we're going.

14
00:00:26,478 --> 00:00:27,805
Are you ready for an adventure?

15
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:31,766
We are, and it's not even
nine o'clock yet baby.

16
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:32,598
Woo!

17
00:00:32,598 --> 00:00:33,432
We are good.

18
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:35,515
What was your suggestion?

19
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,642
- What about the baby name Britith?

20
00:00:39,642 --> 00:00:41,194
- Britith?

21
00:00:41,194 --> 00:00:43,579
Mmm, I'm gonna write that one down okay?

22
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,399
- [Jared] What was the
other name you suggested?

23
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:46,294
- Gary.

24
00:00:46,294 --> 00:00:47,835
- [Jared] Gary?

25
00:00:47,835 --> 00:00:48,918
That's a good name.

26
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:52,162
- Gary or Britith, I will
write that on the list.

27
00:00:52,162 --> 00:00:55,538
We've been having a little
Marco Polo war with Bonnie,

28
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:56,909
wondering they are on the road,

29
00:00:56,909 --> 00:00:58,550
because we left before her,

30
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,626
just by a few minutes--

31
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:01,663
- [Jared] We had to make a stop.

32
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:03,681
- We had to make a stop, where is she?

33
00:01:03,681 --> 00:01:06,001
- They're a little bit
behind us, when we--

34
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,242
- [Ellie] So we're ahead.

35
00:01:07,242 --> 00:01:08,075
- Yeah, we're ahead.

36
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:09,921
We thought we were behind this whole time.

37
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:11,361
Listen, we forgot the walkie-talkies,

38
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:13,594
so I figured this could
be a good alternative,

39
00:01:13,594 --> 00:01:14,857
what do you say there, Ellie Belly?

40
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:15,690
- Where are you?

41
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,276
You ignored my call.

42
00:01:17,276 --> 00:01:20,058
- Wait, I did not ignore your call.

43
00:01:20,058 --> 00:01:23,835
I answered it and I said
hello, hello, hello.

44
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:25,484
- Hello.
- Hello.

45
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:27,901
- Hello, and nobody answered.

46
00:01:30,202 --> 00:01:32,202
We are passing exit 281.

47
00:01:33,958 --> 00:01:37,126
- Okay, we are passing 281 right now.

48
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:38,490
Which lane are you in?

49
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,145
We're trying to catch up to you.

50
00:01:41,145 --> 00:01:42,145
- Good luck.

51
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,665
- I don't have any money,

52
00:01:45,665 --> 00:01:48,774
but what I do have is a
particular set of skills.

53
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:51,941
I will find you and I will follow you.

54
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,438
- Good luck.

55
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:56,866
- We've been having a little,

56
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,834
what did you call it?

57
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:59,470
- Marco Polo.

58
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,942
- [Ellie] And there is Joel
flying through the lanes.

59
00:02:02,942 --> 00:02:05,459
He always has to show us up, that jerk.

60
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:08,408
- [Jared] Everyone is going really slow--

61
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,241
- [Ellie] Look at him.

62
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:10,292
- [Jared] And he's going the speed limit.

63
00:02:10,293 --> 00:02:12,334
So don't worry guys, he's not speeding,

64
00:02:12,334 --> 00:02:14,986
everyone else is just going really slow.

65
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:17,325
- [Ellie] Yes he is, he just flew past us.

66
00:02:17,325 --> 00:02:18,858
- [Jared] Ellie, I'm
trying to save his neck.

67
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,802
- [Ellie] He didn't even wait.

68
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:21,953
That's it.

69
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:24,697
- Now we're playing catch up.

70
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:27,759
Anyone got some ketchup
for this hamburger?

71
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,492
(Terry Crews speaking)

72
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,993
- [Ellie] Listening to this podcast.

73
00:02:31,993 --> 00:02:34,569
- These are two of my favorite people,

74
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,829
Tim Ferriss and Terry Crews.

75
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:39,435
And I've followed Terry Crews

76
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:42,105
for the past four or five years,

77
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:44,241
just his life and
looking behind the scenes

78
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:45,474
and where he's come from

79
00:02:45,474 --> 00:02:46,594
and where he is now.

80
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:48,922
Probably one of the most
genuine human beings

81
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:51,202
that I have ever learned about.

82
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:52,530
I don't know him personally,

83
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,868
but if I could ever meet
him and pick his brain,

84
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:58,157
he's one of the people
that I want to meet,

85
00:02:58,157 --> 00:03:00,084
the most out of anyone.

86
00:03:00,084 --> 00:03:03,644
- I have really enjoyed
listening to this podcast.

87
00:03:03,644 --> 00:03:04,791
The kids were not very happy,

88
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:06,703
when we were like, okay
movie off, listen time.

89
00:03:06,703 --> 00:03:07,916
- Let me finish the whole movie okay?

90
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,675
- Calvin did fall asleep.

91
00:03:09,675 --> 00:03:11,555
He actually likes his blanket now guys.

92
00:03:11,555 --> 00:03:12,660
He likes his Christmas blanket.

93
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,717
- He asked for it before
we even got in the car,

94
00:03:14,717 --> 00:03:16,176
he asked for his new blanket.

95
00:03:16,176 --> 00:03:17,544
- Yeah, I had his old
one because that's one

96
00:03:17,544 --> 00:03:19,631
he's been liking, but he's like no.

97
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:21,451
Anyway, but this has been
a really good podcast,

98
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:24,116
very inspirational, very uplifting,

99
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:26,948
it's really fun to listen to other people

100
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:27,781
and their successes.

101
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:29,596
- I love learning from
other people, you know?

102
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:30,429
- [Ellie] Totally.

103
00:03:30,429 --> 00:03:32,277
- I love learning from other people.

104
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,673
- And we kind of stopped
our little competition,

105
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,807
because Joel always has to win.

106
00:03:37,807 --> 00:03:38,640
Joely.

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,509
- Joel just likes being in front.

108
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:42,212
- Yeah, so fine, Joel you win.

109
00:03:42,212 --> 00:03:44,796
We'll follow you, rather
than you follow us.

110
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:47,591
- Actually the reason
why I want to be behind,

111
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,821
is so I can do adaptive cruise control

112
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:50,870
and just kind of--

113
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,909
- That is nice.

114
00:03:51,909 --> 00:03:53,121
(laughing)

115
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:56,728
He's out too, my handsome little guy.

116
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:58,952
I love that he came up with names today.

117
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:02,308
And I was like, Jackson,
you're so full of adventure,

118
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:04,380
because he's like where
are we, where are we?

119
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,305
And I'm like we're in Salt Lake,

120
00:04:05,305 --> 00:04:06,138
how did we get there?

121
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,091
I'm like we drove there.

122
00:04:08,091 --> 00:04:09,817
(laughs)

123
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,991
And I was like you're
so full of adventure,

124
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,721
and he goes no I'm full of food.

125
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:15,746
And I'm like oh my gosh.

126
00:04:15,746 --> 00:04:17,491
He makes me laugh.

127
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:19,195
I love him.

128
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:21,074
Okay, back onto the podcast.

129
00:04:21,074 --> 00:04:23,386
- Friends don't let friends drive slow.

130
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:25,574
- Jared didn't approve
Joel's illegal lane change

131
00:04:25,574 --> 00:04:26,407
over the double line,

132
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:30,465
so we'll keep up, but
you have to keep the law.

133
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,048
(bright music)

134
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,524
- Oh my goodness, we got here

135
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,922
and the kids are already
going crazy exploring

136
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,985
and Joel, where did you get that cookie?

137
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:50,263
- They left it for us.

138
00:04:50,263 --> 00:04:51,598
- What the heck?

139
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:53,314
(children yelling)

140
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:56,309
They've got fresh cookies for us?

141
00:04:56,309 --> 00:05:00,476
Oh my goodness, well guys,
welcome to our New Year's home.

142
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,233
What?

143
00:05:04,353 --> 00:05:07,270
(children yelling)

144
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,689
Is that your bed Jackson?

145
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:12,609
- Yeah, this is my bed.

146
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:13,442
- [Jared] Oh my goodness.

147
00:05:13,442 --> 00:05:14,956
This is your bed?

148
00:05:14,956 --> 00:05:15,789
- Yeah.

149
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:16,979
- [Jared] Oh my goodness gracious.

150
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,585
Oh look at that, there's stairs up to it.

151
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,418
- [Jackson] And here's a ladder.

152
00:05:20,418 --> 00:05:22,022
- [Jared] That's your bed Lincoln?

153
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:22,855
- Here's a ladder!

154
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:24,766
- [Jared] And a ladder?

155
00:05:24,766 --> 00:05:25,860
Oh my gosh.

156
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,682
- [Olivia] Look at my balcony!

157
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,624
- This is like better than Christmas.

158
00:05:29,624 --> 00:05:31,197
- Yeah.

159
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,448
- Here's a laundry room!

160
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,253
- [Jared] There's a laundry room?

161
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:36,274
- Yeah!

162
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:39,036
- Oh I can't even believe it.

163
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:41,280
- [Ellie] Jackson isn't it crazy?

164
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,327
- Yeah.

165
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:45,471
- [Ellie] There's no snow
and it's warm enough outside.

166
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,287
- Yeah, I feel just, it's crazy here.

167
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:48,436
- I want to go swimming.

168
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:52,264
- Only six hours away, it is snow and cold

169
00:05:52,264 --> 00:05:53,605
and in the 20s and 30s,

170
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,307
but here, it feels good.

171
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:56,267
Six hours, still in Utah.

172
00:05:56,267 --> 00:05:58,240
- Do you have to walk to the pool?

173
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,430
- Yeah, if we go there, we have to walk.

174
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,773
- [Olivia] And it's not that far actually.

175
00:06:02,773 --> 00:06:03,606
- [Ellie] We're gonna help Dad bring in

176
00:06:03,606 --> 00:06:04,439
all of our suitcases.

177
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,272
Do you want to help him

178
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:08,022
- Yeah.
- bring in your suitcase?

179
00:06:09,128 --> 00:06:10,187
- You want your suitcase?

180
00:06:10,187 --> 00:06:11,077
- Yeah.

181
00:06:11,077 --> 00:06:11,910
- There you go.

182
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,839
- Do we have to walk to the pool?

183
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,484
- No we're just gonna take it to your room

184
00:06:15,484 --> 00:06:18,285
and then maybe, we'll
get to the pool later.

185
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:19,118
- [Ellie] Ready?

186
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:21,974
For a little party hardy,
- Ready Freddy.

187
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:24,229
- [Ellie] with our cousins.

188
00:06:24,229 --> 00:06:27,062
- I can put my stuff in the house?

189
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,924
- [Ellie] Uh-huh, go
put it by your bunkbed.

190
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:31,757
And I'll put Calvin's by--

191
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:33,635
- But I can't carry my suitcase.

192
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:34,468
- [Ellie] I can help.

193
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,427
- After we became
acquainted with the house,

194
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:39,523
the most important thing that we had to do

195
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:41,603
was set up Cody's little Nintendo

196
00:06:41,603 --> 00:06:43,379
and we're all playing Mario,

197
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:46,485
like everyone is getting into this.

198
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:47,648
Your turn.

199
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:50,059
- Um Jackson has now learned how to jump.

200
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:51,303
So let's see how far you go this time,

201
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:52,593
remember to jump.

202
00:06:52,593 --> 00:06:54,781
- [Jared] Good, are you Luigi?

203
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,614
- Yeah.

204
00:06:55,614 --> 00:06:57,394
- [Jared] Are you being
the little brother today?

205
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:58,477
Yeah Jackson!

206
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:03,643
- Drove five hours to play Nintendo.

207
00:07:03,643 --> 00:07:04,476
(Jared laughs)

208
00:07:04,476 --> 00:07:05,309
- It's different down south.

209
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:06,728
- It is different, it's a little warmer.

210
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:07,620
- [Ellie] Look Jared,
look how far he's getting.

211
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,208
- [Jared] Jackson you're killing it.

212
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,592
Good job, whoa!
- Woo!

213
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:12,842
- [Jared] Awww!

214
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:14,801
- He got it.

215
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:17,396
- That's my boy.

216
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,538
Gettin' on with Nintendo.

217
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:19,699
Good job son!

218
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,723
- [Ellie] Jackson broke
out the Connect 4 game.

219
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:25,419
Perfect game for you two.

220
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:26,252
Uh-oh.

221
00:07:28,126 --> 00:07:29,948
- No, Jackson, you have to stack right.

222
00:07:29,948 --> 00:07:32,613
- [Ellie] No, no, he
doesn't have to do that.

223
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:35,861
How it works is he puts
them wherever he wants.

224
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:37,311
Let's start over.

225
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:39,604
He puts them wherever he wants,

226
00:07:39,604 --> 00:07:41,015
and you put yours wherever you want,

227
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:43,861
and you try and get four in a row, huh.

228
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:45,906
- I'm going to win.

229
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,273
- [Ellie] Make sure and give him his turn.

230
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:48,755
- [Boston] Jackson, no you're not.

231
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,285
- [Ellie] Jackson won.

232
00:07:50,285 --> 00:07:51,118
- I win.

233
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:52,908
I win.

234
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:55,186
- Remember how I said while
I was climbing the mountains

235
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:57,821
of Utah, how the sunset was just gorgeous,

236
00:07:57,821 --> 00:08:00,251
well the same is true
down here in St. George.

237
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:02,691
There's a lot of more
buildings covering the view,

238
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,882
yeah, it doesn't do it justice,

239
00:08:03,882 --> 00:08:08,046
but the sky is just like red past there.

240
00:08:08,046 --> 00:08:09,850
It looks so beautiful.

241
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,858
One thing that we've been
talking about all day

242
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,002
and looking at all day

243
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:14,337
is Ellie's little belly.

244
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:15,170
I shouldn't even say little,

245
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,603
because look at the thing
bounce, like holy cow.

246
00:08:17,603 --> 00:08:18,436
It's poppin'!

247
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:22,806
- This outfit is not
like the most flattering,

248
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,684
but like I haven't even eaten a full meal

249
00:08:25,684 --> 00:08:28,956
in a long time and it's
totally sticking out.

250
00:08:28,956 --> 00:08:30,948
- [Jared] Ellie look at your belly.

251
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:32,013
- [Bonnie] That's cute.

252
00:08:32,013 --> 00:08:32,972
- Wait, you know what?

253
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,977
I think I know what's
in Ellie's belly, oh.

254
00:08:34,977 --> 00:08:36,152
(laughing)

255
00:08:36,153 --> 00:08:38,597
- I bet you weren't the
first to say that ah.

256
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,562
Ellie belly, isn't that
cute, look at this.

257
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,692
- [Jared] Yeah, he is
growing so much Ellie.

258
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:44,930
- Can you believe it's a boy?

259
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,940
- No.

260
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,224
- How's little Joel doing?

261
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:48,630
(laughing)

262
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,365
- So we talked about baby names

263
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:51,504
the whole way down,

264
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,164
the whole way down.
- Oh I bet.

265
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:56,649
- And guess what name kept coming back up?

266
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:58,563
- [Bonnie] Joel?

267
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:01,884
- [Jared] Joel is a good name.

268
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:02,717
It kept coming up.

269
00:09:02,717 --> 00:09:03,887
- That would be amazing.
- Yeah.

270
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:04,937
- I prefer Hoel.

271
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:05,770
- Hoel?

272
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,238
We definitely that--

273
00:09:07,238 --> 00:09:08,071
- [Ellie] Favorites.

274
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:08,982
- A few favorites, yeah.

275
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:11,084
We have a few that keep coming back up,

276
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,813
one you already know about.

277
00:09:12,813 --> 00:09:15,793
But we had one today that we were like,

278
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:17,768
yeah, I like that a lot so.

279
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:19,260
- George, St. George?

280
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,913
- Joel, don't give it away.

281
00:09:20,913 --> 00:09:24,183
(garbled) You know what I'm saying?

282
00:09:24,183 --> 00:09:25,766
- George?
- Alfonzo.

283
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:28,182
- Alfonzo.
- Yeah.

284
00:09:28,182 --> 00:09:29,263
- [Joel] The Fonz.

285
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:30,501
- [Jared] What, why are you guys laughing?

286
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:31,773
- Okay, I want to tell
them one of the names.

287
00:09:31,773 --> 00:09:32,897
- Get out of here, because
she's gonna tell me.

288
00:09:32,897 --> 00:09:35,982
- Okay okay bye, you can't
be here right now, bye.

289
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:37,865
- [Ellie] Be honest
whether you like it or not.

290
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,217
- Wait, don't say anything
we're still recording!

291
00:09:40,217 --> 00:09:41,724
- Tell Daddy what you just did.

292
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:42,721
- [Jared] What did you do bud?

293
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:43,554
- I pooped.

294
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:45,550
- [Jared] You went poo in the toilet?

295
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,462
- [Ellie] Good job.

296
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,295
We're proud of you.

297
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,445
- [Jared] That's my boy.

298
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:52,056
- Pizza delivery is here.

299
00:09:52,056 --> 00:09:52,889
- Your belly!

300
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:54,379
- [Ellie] Isn't that crazy?

301
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:57,546
(groovy upbeat music)

302
00:10:19,141 --> 00:10:21,855
- This is monumental stuff
happening right here guys.

303
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,181
Okay, so we're sitting
with Aspyn and Parker,

304
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,551
Bonnie and Joel and Ellie.

305
00:10:24,551 --> 00:10:25,514
We just finished playing games.

306
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,717
We're now FaceTiming Cullen and Katie.

307
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,404
While all of this is happening,

308
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:31,548
I get a notification on my watch

309
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,215
that Terry Crews liked my tweet.

310
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,934
The Terry Crews.

311
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:37,776
It's so blurry, I need someone

312
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,535
to tap on it for me.

313
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:40,910
- There you go.
- Thanks Aspyn.

314
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,272
- Oh no!
- Oh no!

315
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:44,784
- [Jared] Terry Crews liked my tweet.

316
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:45,620
- Jared that's cool.
- That's really cool.

317
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,855
- [Joel] Do you think he'd
flex his pecs for you?

318
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,084
- I think that's how he liked it.

319
00:10:48,084 --> 00:10:49,542
He was just just like poof.
- He did it with his pecs.

320
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:52,314
- And that's how he did it on the phone.

321
00:10:52,314 --> 00:10:53,406
- Do you think he clicked on your profile?

322
00:10:53,406 --> 00:10:55,020
- He may, he probably follows
our YouTube channel now.

323
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,066
- Does he subscribe to the vlog?

324
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:57,899
(laughing)

325
00:10:57,899 --> 00:10:59,876
- Thanks Terry, appreciate it.

326
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:00,709
Hey Cullen.

327
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:01,675
- Oh my gosh he did like it.

328
00:11:01,675 --> 00:11:02,967
- Yeah, I'm not making this up,

329
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,104
this is not fake news.

330
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:06,153
This is real life.

331
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:07,914
- [Ellie] He quote-tweeted it.

332
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:08,782
- Get out, what did he say?

333
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:09,615
What did he say?

334
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:11,169
- [Ellie] He said wow, thank you Jared.

335
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:12,804
- Ohhhh!

336
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:13,637
- That was so cool.

337
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:15,474
- That was awesome.

338
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:17,978
All of this is happening right now.

339
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,811
Sorry guys.

340
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,823
Okay, I gotta get back to my friends.

341
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:23,001
Thanks Terry, appreciate you.

342
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,679
What in the world?

343
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,537
- He looks sleepy.
- Come here, buddy

344
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:29,704
- He started walking back real scared.

345
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:32,107
- What was he doing?
- Aww.

346
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:36,918
- [Jared] Hey, do you want
to come sit next to me?

347
00:11:36,918 --> 00:11:38,585
He's like so out of it.

348
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:40,960
I have gone up there three times now

349
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,209
trying to get him back to bed.

350
00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:45,314
- [Bonnie] Awww.

351
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:46,778
- [Jared] Hey buddy.

352
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:47,906
He just wants him Mom.

353
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,748
That's all he wants.

354
00:11:49,748 --> 00:11:51,997
- What did he say to you?

355
00:11:51,997 --> 00:11:54,424
- He was just like, I want my mommy.

356
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,615
He seriously kept backing up like.

357
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,174
- [Jared] His hair is out of this world.

358
00:11:59,174 --> 00:12:00,229
- [Aspyn] He's so blond.

359
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:02,153
I can't figure out who I
think he looks like more.

360
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:03,837
I think he looks like you Ellie.

361
00:12:03,837 --> 00:12:05,088
- I think he looks more like Ellie

362
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:07,663
and I think Jackson looks more like me.

363
00:12:07,663 --> 00:12:09,346
- What's weird is if
you see a picture of me

364
00:12:09,346 --> 00:12:10,417
when I was little--

365
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:11,798
- [Bonnie] It looks just like Jackson.

366
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,920
- Yeah, like the sharp
teeth and dark eyes.

367
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,283
- No I think he looks more like me.

368
00:12:17,283 --> 00:12:18,116
- Okay.

369
00:12:18,116 --> 00:12:20,413
I kinda want him to do
it, so I'm gonna say that.

370
00:12:20,413 --> 00:12:23,591
- Well either way, Jared
and I look very similar.

371
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:26,446
- Some people, this is embarrassing,

372
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,002
they're like are you
guys brother and sister?

373
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,276
And I'm like no.

374
00:12:30,276 --> 00:12:31,284
- We get that too every once in awhile.

375
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:32,400
- [Jared] Do you guys?

376
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,150
- Honestly, it makes you feel so creepy.

377
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,000
- I think couples, when
they've been together

378
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:36,833
for awhile, they start

379
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,666
to look alike.
- To look like each other.

380
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,884
- Totally, the same thing with like pets.

381
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:42,134
Yeah.

382
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:45,086
Like on 101 Dalmatians, how the pets

383
00:12:45,086 --> 00:12:46,027
and the owners are walking

384
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:48,971
and they look so similar, totally fact.

385
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:50,145
- Yes.
- Yeah, it's real.

386
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,268
- Tonight was so fun,

387
00:12:51,268 --> 00:12:52,101
but before we go to bed,

388
00:12:52,101 --> 00:12:54,048
I thought we'd, I showed the upstairs,

389
00:12:54,048 --> 00:12:56,034
I didn't think we showed
the downstairs very much.

390
00:12:56,034 --> 00:12:58,051
This place is really really wonderful.

391
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,689
We've got the kitchen all down here,

392
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,016
kind of like the dining room table

393
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,546
and the living room and that door goes

394
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:05,480
to the backyard.

395
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,240
And then this is where
Bonnie and Joel are sleeping

396
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,728
and in here, I've got to show you this,

397
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:13,542
because I don't know, I think we may have

398
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,645
to kick out (laughs)

399
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:17,036
Joel close the door dude.

400
00:13:17,036 --> 00:13:18,133
- [Joel] You're in my bathroom.

401
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,418
- I am in your bathroom,

402
00:13:19,418 --> 00:13:21,055
but I'm doing a house tour.

403
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:22,950
We might have to kick Bonnie and Joel out

404
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,799
one of these nights,

405
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:26,600
so we can use the bath tub.

406
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,787
It looks awesome.

407
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:28,907
We go out through here,

408
00:13:28,907 --> 00:13:31,087
this is like a huge closet,

409
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,865
and then we're in the laundry room

410
00:13:32,865 --> 00:13:34,875
and then there's another bathroom.

411
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,619
So this is like a duplex,

412
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,779
and it's really cool.

413
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:39,951
I don't know if they call it a duplex

414
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:41,099
or a condo.

415
00:13:41,099 --> 00:13:42,491
Anyway, it's really cool.

416
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,555
I'm really happy to be here.

417
00:13:44,555 --> 00:13:45,915
We had some plans change.

418
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:46,964
We were planning on hanging out

419
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,155
at Carl and Jinger's house,

420
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,291
but they got a little sick,

421
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,891
so slight change of plans,

422
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:51,951
we're gonna still see if we can see them

423
00:13:51,951 --> 00:13:53,340
for New Year's and everything,

424
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,061
but it's going to be a
great New Year's this week.

425
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,235
And that is where we're
going to end the vlog.

426
00:13:57,235 --> 00:13:58,992
