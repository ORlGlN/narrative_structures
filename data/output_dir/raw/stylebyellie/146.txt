1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,824
- [Ellie] Go hide the pumpkins.

2
00:00:01,824 --> 00:00:03,556
- Don't tell us where
you're hiding it Jackson.

3
00:00:03,556 --> 00:00:05,207
That's the point of the game.

4
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:06,040
(laughing)

5
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,873
- You don't need three vacuums,

6
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,447
I'm like no, I do.

7
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,162
- Full size candy bars!

8
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:11,762
The cat is out of the bag.

9
00:00:11,762 --> 00:00:14,169
And thanks to Jackson, we are going

10
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,800
- If you eat it like Boston,

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,423
I will so cry.

12
00:00:18,423 --> 00:00:21,006
(Jared laughs)

13
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:29,732
- [Jared] Good morning boys, how are ya?

14
00:00:29,732 --> 00:00:32,705
You eatin' breakfast at Daddy's feet?

15
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:33,568
(Jared laughs)

16
00:00:33,568 --> 00:00:35,256
How, that is the cutest thing

17
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,583
in the whole entire world.

18
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,790
Like, that pan down to
these beautiful kids.

19
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,651
Hey Calvin, where are you going,

20
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:42,627
you're ruining the sweet moment.

21
00:00:42,627 --> 00:00:44,083
I'm kidding.

22
00:00:44,083 --> 00:00:44,923
I'm kidding.

23
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:46,711
(munching)

24
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:47,858
(razor buzzing)

25
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,526
- [Calvin] Mommy Mommy.

26
00:00:50,526 --> 00:00:52,405
- Hey Jackson, I just don't think

27
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:57,125
you can be any happier
about getting your hair cut.

28
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,597
Oh you think you can?

29
00:00:58,597 --> 00:00:59,925
Okay good, I'm glad you think so.

30
00:00:59,925 --> 00:01:00,983
- We're getting there.

31
00:01:00,983 --> 00:01:01,816
- We are.

32
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:02,649
Calvin's already done,

33
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,239
and then it's my turn.

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,678
You have just been
cruising around on that,

35
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,799
oh crash, cruising and crashing.

36
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,527
I think those little
Strider bikes are so awesome

37
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,634
in helping transition kids from learning

38
00:01:13,634 --> 00:01:16,946
to do like a non-pedal
bike to a pedal bike.

39
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:19,674
Jackson literally did it on his first try.

40
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,689
Calvin's not there yet,

41
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:21,580
but he will be pretty soon.

42
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:22,795
I think by his birthday,

43
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:24,154
by the time he turns three,

44
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:26,178
he will be ready to ride a bike,

45
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,319
just like Jackson did.

46
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,736
- It's so fluffy.

47
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:32,208
- What am I, a stuffed animal.

48
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:35,561
- You have a lot of it,
it's just really full.

49
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:37,524
Someone asked the other
day if you were 90.

50
00:01:37,524 --> 00:01:39,325
- Oh because of my gray hair.

51
00:01:39,325 --> 00:01:40,485
- Is he 90?

52
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,366
- Hey, it's experience and wisdom.

53
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:44,012
I'm happy with my full head of hair.

54
00:01:44,012 --> 00:01:46,479
- Oh you look so ravishing.
- I'm very happy with it.

55
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,312
- Thank you.

56
00:01:47,312 --> 00:01:50,729
- Alright guys, my floors are disgusting.

57
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:53,971
Ah, you can't even tell.

58
00:01:54,862 --> 00:01:56,376
Okay (laughs).

59
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:57,823
Bad bad bad angle.

60
00:01:57,823 --> 00:02:01,032
Okay, they really are really dirty,

61
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:05,463
really sticky, Calvin may
have dropped Gatorade,

62
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:10,303
he left a trail all over
the house with Gatorade,

63
00:02:10,303 --> 00:02:13,160
so I just, I need a vacuum.

64
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,743
Last night I ended up taking my

65
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:19,216
So we have two vacuums,
we have a big vacuum,

66
00:02:19,216 --> 00:02:22,779
it's a Dyson, and then we
have a small cordless one

67
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,445
that we usually use
for the hardwood floor,

68
00:02:24,445 --> 00:02:25,588
like daily upkeep.

69
00:02:25,588 --> 00:02:27,773
And I took apart it,

70
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,865
just the hand held one,

71
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:31,713
and I went in the car and vacuumed it

72
00:02:31,713 --> 00:02:33,675
and it got all the dog hair out

73
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:37,258
and then I actually
washed the vacuums out,

74
00:02:38,146 --> 00:02:39,570
like I took the filters out,

75
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,467
I rinsed them, I cleaned them, they're dry

76
00:02:41,467 --> 00:02:43,172
and so now my vacuums are clean

77
00:02:43,172 --> 00:02:44,666
and I'm ready to re-clean the floors,

78
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,401
because they are so so dirty.

79
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,033
And I told Jared, I was like we need

80
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:50,191
I think we need another vacuum

81
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:51,832
and he literally laughed out loud.

82
00:02:51,832 --> 00:02:53,697
Is this cracked?

83
00:02:53,697 --> 00:02:54,658
No it's not.

84
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:56,729
He laughed out loud because he was like,

85
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:57,942
we don't need three vacuums,

86
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,617
and I'm like, no I do,

87
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:00,956
'cause like I clean them,

88
00:03:00,956 --> 00:03:02,015
we're, I don't know,

89
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,325
I feel like I almost need another,

90
00:03:03,325 --> 00:03:05,931
and that sounds really ridiculous.

91
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:09,153
But I wouldn't might having a third one.

92
00:03:09,153 --> 00:03:09,986
But I need to clean.

93
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,173
Our house is really sticky and dirty,

94
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:13,184
and then we can play and have fun today.

95
00:03:13,184 --> 00:03:16,385
For mopping, I actually
have two mops as well,

96
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:18,529
same thing, one really nice heavy duty one

97
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:22,114
and then one that is just kind of nice

98
00:03:22,114 --> 00:03:25,129
just to do throughout
the week to maintain.

99
00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:26,794
I got this one on Amazon,

100
00:03:26,794 --> 00:03:29,793
it's like a spin brush one
that I've really enjoyed.

101
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,783
It took me awhile to
find one that I thought

102
00:03:31,783 --> 00:03:32,735
would work for me.

103
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:33,568
So far I've liked it,

104
00:03:33,568 --> 00:03:35,331
I don't really know what
else to compare it to.

105
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,973
But I'm gonna use this today,

106
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:37,893
I just fill it with water

107
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:39,884
and add a little bit of vinegar in it,

108
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,395
and it rings it out really good,

109
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,627
so it doesn't leave
moisture on the ground.

110
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:46,192
And then throughout the
week I have this one,

111
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,363
it's not a Swiffer, I like Swiffers,

112
00:03:48,363 --> 00:03:49,312
it's like the same thing,

113
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,563
it's a Bona one,

114
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,691
and I just have the Bona
cleaner that I spray

115
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,043
on the wood floor for touch ups.

116
00:03:56,043 --> 00:03:59,050
Why am I, I'm out of breath.

117
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,240
I'm out of breath because I was vacuuming.

118
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,797
I was gonna say I don't
know why I'm out of breath,

119
00:04:01,797 --> 00:04:05,075
but obviously it's because I'm working.

120
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:08,575
(quirky enchanting music)

121
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:18,563
- Calvin watch, I'm gonna,

122
00:04:18,564 --> 00:04:19,897
get down, watch.

123
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:29,073
- [Ellie] Is Calvin trying to copy you?

124
00:04:29,073 --> 00:04:30,740
- And now like this.

125
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,506
- [Ellie] Do you remember
that picture of me and you

126
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,802
eating chicken scampi?

127
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,762
- Yes,

128
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:36,693
I always think about that
- for the first time?

129
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,157
- when we come here.

130
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,504
- [Ellie] I thought I had
that in our room, but I don't.

131
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:42,145
- No I don't think we've
ever printed it out,

132
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:43,573
have we?
- Aww.

133
00:04:43,573 --> 00:04:45,099
- [Ellie] Well we'll show
you that picture right now.

134
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:45,932
- [Jared] Yeah.

135
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,748
- [Ellie] But Jared and I for years would

136
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:49,731
share chicken scampi and
I think after eight years,

137
00:04:49,731 --> 00:04:50,844
it's about time we get our own.

138
00:04:50,844 --> 00:04:52,227
- Get our own (laughs).

139
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,060
- [Mom] You've grown up.

140
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,893
- [Ellie] We're more hungry.

141
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,400
- This is the lunch portion,

142
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,246
we shared the dinner portion.

143
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:59,486
- [Ellie] We're out to
lunch with Mom and Dad, hi.

144
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:00,498
- Hi.

145
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:03,556
- [Ellie] And little Cal is asleep.

146
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:05,106
This is like the best lunch date

147
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:06,869
is when one of them is asleep,
- When the kids are asleep.

148
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:10,066
- [Ellie] because then I
can really enjoy the food.

149
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:10,899
- You want cheese on yours?
- You want some cheese

150
00:05:10,899 --> 00:05:11,732
- [Jared] on your cheese
and pepperoni pizza?

151
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:13,115
- No.

152
00:05:13,115 --> 00:05:13,948
No.
- Okay.

153
00:05:13,948 --> 00:05:15,108
- [Ellie] So no thanks.

154
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,941
Jackson ordered pizza
with ketchup and grapes.

155
00:05:19,915 --> 00:05:21,570
- And I think that's weird at first

156
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,797
but then I realize that
the sauce is tomato sauce,

157
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:26,761
so is it really that
weird to have ketchup as

158
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,773
- [Ellie] He really wanted ketchup.

159
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:30,005
- [Jared] What are you gonna show me?

160
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:30,838
- A pumpkin.

161
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:33,744
- [Jared] Okay let's see it.

162
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:34,681
- [Ellie] Now turn it around,

163
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:36,898
show him the other face.

164
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:38,466
He drew.

165
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,246
- [Jared] Oh that tiny little

166
00:05:40,246 --> 00:05:43,400
That (laughing)

167
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,317
- It's a sad face.
- Hi.

168
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:47,980
- Okay, are you guys
ready to play the game?

169
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,032
- I'm gonna hide it.

170
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:50,726
- Okay.
- We're gonna play.

171
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,318
- The kids love doing stuff like this

172
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:53,513
and it's fun for us.

173
00:05:53,513 --> 00:05:57,513
We are gonna play, hide and seek pumpkin.

174
00:05:57,513 --> 00:05:59,063
- [Jared] Bum bum ba!

175
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,922
- Okay, you go hide if first really good

176
00:06:00,922 --> 00:06:02,836
and then Calvin will come find it.

177
00:06:02,836 --> 00:06:04,746
- Don't tell us where
you're hiding it Jackson,

178
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:07,243
that's the point of the game.

179
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,122
Did you hear it?

180
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:08,955
- I heard it.

181
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:11,029
- Oh man.
- Okay, we'll come find it.

182
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:13,714
- So we literally have been
doing boring adult things

183
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:15,406
for the past couple hours

184
00:06:15,406 --> 00:06:17,342
and the kids have been so good,

185
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:19,678
so we are just focusing
all of our attention

186
00:06:19,678 --> 00:06:22,454
and energy on having fun
with the kids right now.

187
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:24,638
Don't tell us where it is Jackson.

188
00:06:24,638 --> 00:06:25,732
(laughing)

189
00:06:25,732 --> 00:06:28,652
Okay, let's see if Calvin can find it.

190
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:29,652
Where is it?

191
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:34,811
He's so proud about him hiding it.

192
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,785
Oh he just put his there too.

193
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:38,723
Okay here's the deal boys.

194
00:06:38,723 --> 00:06:41,112
Okay now it's Daddy's turn.

195
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:43,285
I'm gonna draw a face on a pumpkin

196
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:45,092
and you have to find the pumpkin

197
00:06:45,092 --> 00:06:47,228
and you have to tell me
who's face it is, okay?

198
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,324
So I'm probably gonna need
a couple minutes, right?

199
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,576
Maybe you'll do another round
while I draw a face, okay?

200
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,673
I'm gonna need a couple minutes alright?

201
00:06:52,673 --> 00:06:53,527
Oh bum bum.

202
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:54,854
- Okay.

203
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,161
- [Jared] It's so blurry.

204
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:57,829
Ellie, your bum is so blurry.

205
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:58,710
There we go.

206
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,310
- Go hide 'em.

207
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,885
Go hide the pumpkins.

208
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:02,718
(Jared laughing)

209
00:07:02,718 --> 00:07:03,551
- [Jackson] Okay.

210
00:07:03,551 --> 00:07:04,622
- [Jared] There's the place
that I was looking for.

211
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:05,869
- Go hide 'em.

212
00:07:05,869 --> 00:07:09,418
- [Jared] Okay, show 'em, wait wait.

213
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,835
Now put 'em here.

214
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,890
There we go.

215
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:14,719
- While we are waiting for Jared

216
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:16,595
to hide the pumpkins,

217
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:18,072
we want to tell you something.

218
00:07:18,072 --> 00:07:19,905
- I'm Captain America.

219
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:22,197
- I'm Hulk.

220
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:24,051
- You're Hulk?

221
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:25,781
(laughing)

222
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:27,664
Okay okay, let me tell them something.

223
00:07:27,664 --> 00:07:29,618
So I bought pants for Jackson and Calvin

224
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:31,529
a few weeks ago.

225
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,249
- We're playing hide the pumpkin.

226
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,505
- We are, we're waiting
for Daddy to hide it.

227
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,467
And the pants

228
00:07:37,467 --> 00:07:40,033
for both the kids
- No, where's Dad?

229
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:41,347
- Yeah, Dad's hiding it.

230
00:07:41,347 --> 00:07:42,933
- Oh.

231
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:45,101
- And I got the kids' pants

232
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:47,229
and they were both way too big on them.

233
00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:48,062
- No no no!

234
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:50,043
- And I was gonna return
them and life got busy

235
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,318
and I thought I'd hold
onto them for a minute.

236
00:07:52,318 --> 00:07:54,281
Both the kids had a crazy growth spurt.

237
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:56,543
They totally fit Jackson in these ones,

238
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,445
did not even fit close to Calvin

239
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,775
a few weeks ago.

240
00:08:00,775 --> 00:08:02,640
I mean they're still just a hair big,

241
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,616
but I feel like they fit him

242
00:08:04,616 --> 00:08:07,548
and especially come two
months into December,

243
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,694
they'll really fit better,
but they look good.

244
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,493
I can't believe how fast they're growing.

245
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:14,007
- [Jared] Calvin, I hid it,
come upstairs and find it.

246
00:08:14,007 --> 00:08:15,581
Whoa!

247
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:17,464
Jackson I hid it, come
upstairs and find it.

248
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,443
That could've been really bad.

249
00:08:19,443 --> 00:08:21,010
Okay, you gotta find it

250
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,723
and you gotta guess who's
on the pumpkin, okay?

251
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:24,556
- Okay.

252
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:27,053
Where is it?

253
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:29,521
What?

254
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:30,690
- Do you see it?

255
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,052
Was that too easy?

256
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,169
- [Ellie] That was cuter than heck.

257
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,636
- [Jared] Okay, go find it.

258
00:08:35,636 --> 00:08:36,469
- Sponge Bob.

259
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,494
- Oh that was so fast.

260
00:08:37,494 --> 00:08:38,840
Oh my gosh, you're so good,

261
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,155
you told from all the way over here.

262
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:42,988
Who is it?

263
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:46,275
- It's too high for me.

264
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,108
- [Jared] Penny.

265
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,987
- Do you want to hide it next?
- Okay.

266
00:08:50,987 --> 00:08:52,173
- Okay, okay.
- I'm gonna hide it under

267
00:08:52,173 --> 00:08:54,508
- Okay, you don't tell us
where you're hiding it.

268
00:08:54,508 --> 00:08:55,549
- Okay.

269
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,382
- I think I'm gonna hide it.

270
00:08:56,382 --> 00:08:58,036
- [Jared] Don't tell us where.

271
00:08:58,036 --> 00:09:01,440
- No shh shh okay, don't
tell us, just go hide it.

272
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
Come here Cal, Cal

273
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,520
- [Jared] What are you
gonna draw on this one?

274
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,770
- A happy face.

275
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,138
- [Jared] Okay, first you do a sad face,

276
00:09:10,138 --> 00:09:12,150
now you're doing a happy face.

277
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,483
There's the eye.

278
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:19,454
Good job, there's another eye.

279
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:21,622
That's so good, okay, are
you gonna hide it now?

280
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:23,338
- You know what, we need to
set up those ghosts tonight.

281
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:24,371
- [Jared] Yes we do.

282
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:25,482
- Do you think the kids
want to do that after this?

283
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:26,452
- [Jared] Oh I'm sure they do,

284
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:28,619
that would be so much fun.

285
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,979
Here's your job, you gotta go hide it,

286
00:09:30,979 --> 00:09:32,667
but you can't tell us where you're gonna

287
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:33,876
hide it okay?

288
00:09:33,876 --> 00:09:36,628
That's the point, that's
for us to find, alright?

289
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:39,532
- I'm gonna go super fast and hide it

290
00:09:39,532 --> 00:09:42,579
with my glove, my Spider glove.

291
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,612
- Spiderman glove.
- Awesome.

292
00:09:44,612 --> 00:09:45,445
- [Jackson] Come find it!

293
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:47,341
- [Jared] Okay are you guys ready?

294
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:49,506
Penny's ready too, let's go.

295
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,727
Okay Penny, sniff it out.

296
00:09:51,727 --> 00:09:52,560
- [Ellie] Okay Calvin go find the pumpkin.

297
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,543
- [Jared] That's not the right way.

298
00:09:53,543 --> 00:09:54,437
- [Ellie] Jackson, don't walk to it,

299
00:09:54,437 --> 00:09:56,003
let Calvin find it.

300
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:57,207
- [Jared] Do you see it?

301
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:58,263
- Yeah.

302
00:09:58,263 --> 00:09:59,666
- [Jared] Okay let's go get it.

303
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,722
Can you get it?

304
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:02,555
It's your turn to hide it.

305
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:04,618
Let's go hide it for Jackson, okay?

306
00:10:04,618 --> 00:10:07,037
Let's go and then we'll see
if he can find it, let's go.

307
00:10:07,037 --> 00:10:09,650
Go go go go, where should we hide it?

308
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,483
- That one.

309
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:11,793
- [Jared] Okay.

310
00:10:11,793 --> 00:10:13,112
- Bed.

311
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,830
- [Jared] Oh in his bed?

312
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,663
- Yeah.

313
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:18,904
- [Jared] Okay, let's be so quiet.

314
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:21,104
Oh yeah, how about in the teepee?

315
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:22,517
Oh under the bed?

316
00:10:22,517 --> 00:10:23,350
- [Calvin] Yeah.

317
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,887
- Okay, there you go.

318
00:10:24,887 --> 00:10:26,250
Let's go. Tell him it's ready.

319
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,497
(Calvin vocalizes)

320
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:28,930
- Okay let's go.

321
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,704
- Okay I'm gonna go find it.

322
00:10:30,704 --> 00:10:31,537
- No, mine!

323
00:10:31,537 --> 00:10:34,319
(laughing)

324
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:36,719
- They're still learning
the point of the game.

325
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,552
- No mine.

326
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:40,051
- [Jared] I think he'll find it.

327
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:42,100
No, you're good, you're good.

328
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,267
- Keep going.
- Keep going.

329
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,916
- Shut up Mom and Dad.

330
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:48,074
- [Jared] Where's Calvin?

331
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:50,918
Shoot (laughs).

332
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:51,830
He was looking over here.

333
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,310
I bet you anything Calvin's gonna come out

334
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,495
with it in his hands.

335
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:57,441
- I thought he was right
there, when we came down.

336
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:58,333
(yelling)

337
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,333
- Oh he did.

338
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,013
You kids, you kids.

339
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:05,398
- Okay Mama's turn.

340
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:06,638
- Mama's turn to find it.

341
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:08,975
- And you guys close your eyes.

342
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:09,834
(yells)

343
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:10,669
Not one of those.

344
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,906
- [Jared] Ooh Mom's
throwing out the tricks.

345
00:11:12,906 --> 00:11:14,250
- Where did it go?

346
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,083
- [Jared] Where did it go?

347
00:11:15,083 --> 00:11:16,621
We gotta find it.

348
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:17,970
- Where did it go?

349
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,220
I have no idea where it is.

350
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:23,092
- Look in and under and

351
00:11:30,174 --> 00:11:31,162
(Jared gasps)

352
00:11:31,162 --> 00:11:35,402
- Calvin found it, yay!
- Calvin found it!

353
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:38,612
- That was nice of you to give that.

354
00:11:38,612 --> 00:11:41,293
- Yeah, I'm gonna hide it now.

355
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,126
- That was fun.
- Okay.

356
00:11:43,976 --> 00:11:46,476
- [Ellie] Oh no, oh no, oh no!

357
00:11:47,904 --> 00:11:49,154
Not the ghosts!

358
00:11:50,451 --> 00:11:51,890
What's that?

359
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,417
I may have three very large ghosts

360
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,922
to put in the front yard

361
00:11:57,922 --> 00:12:00,843
and that it is baby, three.

362
00:12:00,843 --> 00:12:02,428
Okay, let's go put it in the front yard.

363
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,530
Jared has not seen these yet.

364
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,697
Woooo.
- Woooo.

365
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:09,332
- [Ellie] What do you think?

366
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,590
- They're cool.

367
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,520
- I've had 'em
- I thought they were

368
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,886
- air ones, like blow up ones,

369
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:13,856
but you stick 'em in the ground, huh?

370
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,301
- [Ellie] Yeah, it's just
like those little ones.

371
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,630
- That's so cool.

372
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,102
- [Ellie] Look at that sunset.

373
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:20,768
Oh my goodness.

374
00:12:20,768 --> 00:12:22,601
- [Jared] Ooh wee ooh,

375
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:25,620
we got some very spooky ghosts.

376
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,345
- Ooh wee ooh.

377
00:12:27,345 --> 00:12:28,500
(Jared laughs)

378
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,819
- [Jared] It is so windy today.

379
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,413
Look how cool that looks
with the wind boys.

380
00:12:33,413 --> 00:12:36,115
Does that look awesome Calvin?

381
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:36,948
- That looks cool.

382
00:12:36,948 --> 00:12:38,039
- [Jared] Yeah.

383
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,348
Guess what?

384
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:40,265
Tomorrow is

385
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:42,600
- Halloween.

386
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,340
- [Jared] It's Halloween.

387
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,026
And you know what you're gonna do?

388
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:47,459
You're gonna wake up,

389
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:48,755
you're gonna put your costume on,

390
00:12:48,755 --> 00:12:51,338
if you don't already have it on

391
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,517
and you are gonna go to school

392
00:12:54,517 --> 00:12:56,361
and you're gonna have a Halloween party.

393
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:57,194
- Yeah.

394
00:12:57,194 --> 00:12:58,597
- [Jared] Are you so excited?

395
00:12:58,597 --> 00:13:00,413
- Yeah, like you.

396
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:01,406
- It's excited too.

397
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:02,239
See?

398
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,430
This is my excited face.

399
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:05,942
Show me your excited face.

400
00:13:05,942 --> 00:13:07,473
But then after that,

401
00:13:07,473 --> 00:13:08,976
we're gonna come home,

402
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:10,831
we're gonna do some things at our house

403
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,868
and then our cousins are gonna come over,

404
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:13,940
we're gonna play.

405
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,864
And we're gonna go around the neighborhood

406
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,429
and trick or treat.

407
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:17,262
- Yeah.

408
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,959
- [Jared] And what do you get
when you say trick or treat

409
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:19,847
at someone's house?

410
00:13:19,847 --> 00:13:21,326
- Trick or treat, candy.

411
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:23,275
- [Jared] Yeah, trick or treat candy.

412
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:25,059
And what happens when you wake up

413
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,972
in the morning after Halloween?

414
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,219
What does Mommy and Daddy do?

415
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:29,386
- Go to China.

416
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,983
- Mommy and Daddy are gonna be gone, huh.

417
00:13:33,983 --> 00:13:34,888
- [Jared] Yeah.

418
00:13:34,888 --> 00:13:36,927
- And we've been talking about this a lot.

419
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:38,765
And you're gonna spent
lots of time with both sets

420
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:41,621
of grandparents, and
you're gonna see cousins

421
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,038
during that time.

422
00:13:44,206 --> 00:13:45,309
(growls)

423
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:46,578
You're okay?

424
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:47,502
- Yeah I'm okay.

425
00:13:47,502 --> 00:13:49,251
- That's a good boy.
- You'll be good for them.

426
00:13:49,251 --> 00:13:50,084
- Yeah.

427
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:52,213
- [Jared] But what do
Mom and Dad usually do

428
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:56,080
with your candy when you
wake up after Halloween?

429
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,376
- Eat.

430
00:13:57,376 --> 00:13:58,209
- Do we eat it all?

431
00:13:58,209 --> 00:13:59,317
- [Jared] Do we eat it all?

432
00:13:59,317 --> 00:14:00,796
- We won't.

433
00:14:00,796 --> 00:14:02,723
- [Jared] Is it just a joke?

434
00:14:02,723 --> 00:14:06,677
- If you eat it like
Boston, I will so cry.

435
00:14:06,677 --> 00:14:08,604
(laughing)

436
00:14:08,604 --> 00:14:09,604
- We won't eat it all.

437
00:14:09,604 --> 00:14:10,545
- [Jared] We won't eat it, I promise.

438
00:14:10,545 --> 00:14:11,726
- Maybe you can just give us a piece.

439
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:14,563
- [Jared] Can you share a piece with us?

440
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:15,396
- Yeah.

441
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,274
- [Jared] Aw that's so nice of you,

442
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,730
thank you so much.

443
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,330
- I'll give one to you.

444
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,267
- [Jared] Oh perfect, thank you.

445
00:14:20,267 --> 00:14:21,867
- And one to you.

446
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:22,954
- Two?

447
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:24,015
- One to you and one to you.

448
00:14:24,015 --> 00:14:26,588
- What if I want two?

449
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:27,503
- Just one.

450
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,043
- That's what I tell you

451
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:30,960
and you always bargain.

452
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:34,262
Well I'm three, so can I have three?

453
00:14:34,262 --> 00:14:36,021
- I'm 29 years old,

454
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:38,822
can I have 29 pieces of candy?

455
00:14:38,822 --> 00:14:40,219
- That's too many.
- Yeah.

456
00:14:40,219 --> 00:14:41,332
(laughing)

457
00:14:41,332 --> 00:14:42,573
- Alright, it's time for bed.

458
00:14:42,573 --> 00:14:43,406
- We'll stick with one.

459
00:14:43,406 --> 00:14:45,409
- Give me kisses.

460
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:46,825
I love you.

461
00:14:46,825 --> 00:14:48,158
- I'm gonna turn

462
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:52,941
- [Jared] Where are you going?

463
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:53,881
(switch clicks)

464
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:56,011
- Oh.
- Good job.

465
00:14:56,011 --> 00:14:56,844
- [Jared] Good night.

466
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,119
- I was like where are you heading,

467
00:14:58,119 --> 00:14:59,449
come on let's lay down.

468
00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:00,793
- Sleep tight buddy okay.

469
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:02,097
Well guys the secret is out

470
00:15:02,097 --> 00:15:03,705
and the cat is out of the bag.

471
00:15:03,705 --> 00:15:06,594
- And thanks to Jackson,
we are going to China.

472
00:15:06,594 --> 00:15:07,427
(gasps)

473
00:15:07,427 --> 00:15:08,289
- There you have it.

474
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,474
You guys know the news.

475
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,939
The news is now not new, it's old.

476
00:15:11,939 --> 00:15:13,228
(laughing)

477
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,890
Sit.

478
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:15,723
Good girl.

479
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,537
- [Ellie] She's like I'm good at minding.

480
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:21,851
- [Jared] But I'm gonna wag
my tail and act like I can.

481
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,274
- You're not, sorry.

482
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:26,773
- [Jared] Ellie tomorrow is
Halloween, are you so excited?

483
00:15:26,773 --> 00:15:27,876
- I'm excited, Jackson is excited

484
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,121
he has a little party at his pre-school.

485
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:32,780
- I know, I think that's the funnest part

486
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,030
is seeing through the years

487
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,501
all of the excitement from the kids.

488
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,453
But I'm also excited,

489
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:41,262
because I'm a freakin' adult.

490
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:43,685
I'm an adult and I get to choose

491
00:15:43,685 --> 00:15:45,773
what we do for Halloween.

492
00:15:45,773 --> 00:15:47,577
- And I'm gonna eat whatever I want.

493
00:15:47,577 --> 00:15:48,482
- [Jared] Yeah.

494
00:15:48,482 --> 00:15:49,315
- Like I do every day of my life.

495
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,148
- I was just gonna say,

496
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,322
so it's a regular day for Ellie.

497
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:54,840
But I'm excited, we've got some fun candy

498
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,568
and some ghosts in the front yard,

499
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:59,358
just Halloween and it's our neighborhood,

500
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,991
and so there's gonna be a lot of memories

501
00:16:00,991 --> 00:16:02,970
that we make here for a long long time.

502
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,190
- And Jared just bought
candy bars to pass out.

503
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,023
- I did!

504
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:08,944
Full size candy bars!

505
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:11,591
Penny, full size candy bars!

506
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,760
Penny, full size candy bars!

507
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,329
I'm really excited, I've never done that.

508
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:16,304
But we're gonna be that house.

509
00:16:16,304 --> 00:16:17,245
At least for a little bit,

510
00:16:17,245 --> 00:16:18,980
I didn't buy a ton.

511
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,813
- [Ellie] You bought a box.

512
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,674
- I bought a box,

513
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:24,776
so it's like the first few
people that come to our house,

514
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:26,311
full size candy bars!

515
00:16:26,311 --> 00:16:28,182
Full size candy bars!

516
00:16:28,182 --> 00:16:29,773
- For all the two year old
and three year old toddlers

517
00:16:29,773 --> 00:16:32,501
that go at five o'clock before the rest.

518
00:16:32,501 --> 00:16:33,588
- That's right, that's right.

519
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,259
So we are gonna call it a night,

520
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,400
because we have a big day tomorrow.

521
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,607
Thank you so much for watching.

522
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,286
If you enjoyed it, give
it a big thumbs up.

523
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,076
We're gonna eat some cheesecake
and we'll see you later.

524
00:16:41,076 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
- Bye.
