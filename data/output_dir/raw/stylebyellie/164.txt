1
00:00:00,791 --> 00:00:03,770
(dramatic operatic music)

2
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,937
- [Jared] Here you go, here's
your poop emoji costume.

3
00:00:12,406 --> 00:00:13,341
- Hurry up, hurry up,

4
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:16,216
our cousins are coming,
our cousins are coming!

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,158
This is what they do when
their cousins are coming.

6
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:22,658
Your matching little bums, you're so cute.

7
00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:27,223
This is a cute little sight I think.

8
00:00:27,223 --> 00:00:29,409
This is perfect, because actually,

9
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:31,165
I need to get ready and as you can see,

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:32,508
I've been trying to get the kids ready.

11
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:33,623
Thank you so much Bonnie.

12
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:34,879
This morning she called me,

13
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,063
she said I have a pedicure,
would you like to come?

14
00:00:37,063 --> 00:00:39,872
And I said yes, but Jared's working,

15
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,183
and we went to bed really late.

16
00:00:41,183 --> 00:00:43,350
And she was so sweet,
and got us a babysitter.

17
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,590
So we are gonna go out for an hour

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,742
and get our toes done.

19
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:47,141
I tend to repeat myself a lot,

20
00:00:47,141 --> 00:00:49,501
but I still get these questions a lot,

21
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,070
so I want to show you guys.

22
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,405
This is the hair gel
that I use for the kids,

23
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:57,518
it's Got2b Glued and it's glue.

24
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:58,686
Their hair stays

25
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:01,837
and I have tried so many other hair gels,

26
00:01:01,837 --> 00:01:03,003
it's really dark in here.

27
00:01:03,003 --> 00:01:05,256
I've tried so many other hair gels

28
00:01:05,256 --> 00:01:06,923
and it doesn't work,

29
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,614
like this is the bed
hair gel for little boys

30
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,215
or little girls with short hair.

31
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:14,846
If it had little curls,

32
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:15,791
you could put it in your hand

33
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,529
and scrunch it, make it curly.

34
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:19,306
It's very very strong,

35
00:01:19,306 --> 00:01:20,971
you only need a little

36
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:22,666
and it's really messy on your hands,

37
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,426
but once it's dried, it's glue

38
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:27,066
and it stays, so this is my favorite thing

39
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,588
for the boys.

40
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,688
But I always put them in
Jared's drawer right here

41
00:01:32,688 --> 00:01:34,617
and they have their toothbrushes,

42
00:01:34,617 --> 00:01:37,151
just 'cause like we're
getting ready in the mornings

43
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,387
and usually I have them get ready with me

44
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:40,220
and I sit them on the counter

45
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,575
and we brush their teeth

46
00:01:41,575 --> 00:01:42,469
and do their hair,

47
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,886
so that is my little tidbit for the kids.

48
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,086
So here's the thing,

49
00:01:48,086 --> 00:01:51,933
my great grandma, she
lived until she was 102,

50
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:54,781
and I remember going to
visit her with my mom.

51
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,749
I was really young, I was
probably like four or five,

52
00:01:59,749 --> 00:02:02,309
and I remember her and her voice

53
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:06,086
was so week and so shaky, like this,

54
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:08,860
and that's exactly how it sounded like.

55
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:10,466
And there's been a few times in my life

56
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:13,193
where my mom has sounded like that

57
00:02:13,193 --> 00:02:15,982
and if I have the slightest itch

58
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:18,502
in my throat and I clear it out,

59
00:02:18,502 --> 00:02:21,349
it's like it damages my throat a little

60
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,246
and I sound hoarse.

61
00:02:23,246 --> 00:02:25,496
And I didn't even get sick,

62
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,374
the kids are getting over their colds,

63
00:02:28,374 --> 00:02:29,803
and like I didn't even get sick,

64
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:31,467
but I had an itchy throat

65
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:33,260
and I cleared it one day a lot

66
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,250
like I was constantly
like (clears throat),

67
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,151
and then the next day I had lost my voice.

68
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:39,512
So I sound worse than I am,

69
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:40,983
I mean I may look a little bad,

70
00:02:40,983 --> 00:02:45,516
but I always think of my
grandma when I lose my voice,

71
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:49,066
because her voice was always so weak,

72
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:52,408
and I feel like that's
where I get it from.

73
00:02:52,408 --> 00:02:55,736
And my mom, she has a weak voice too,

74
00:02:55,736 --> 00:02:58,897
especially over the last few years.

75
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,279
We're like Mom, speak up,

76
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:01,447
she's like I am.

77
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:02,818
So I feel like my mom's voice

78
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:06,564
is a lot like her grandma's voice, so.

79
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:08,542
Getting ready for the day.

80
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,760
Doing a little dry shampoo, curl my hair.

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,191
What are you thinking Mr. Jackson?

82
00:03:13,191 --> 00:03:15,441
Calvin, what are you doing?

83
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:19,676
Did you grab Jackson's robe too?

84
00:03:20,841 --> 00:03:22,821
Yes you did, don't say no.

85
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:24,692
Right here, this is Jackson's.

86
00:03:24,692 --> 00:03:27,740
Oh it's the one piece, it's yours.

87
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,917
Jackson has the same one downstairs.

88
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,798
Are you wanting to hold the camera?

89
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:32,631
- Yeah.

90
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:33,954
- [Ellie] You want to hold it?

91
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:37,037
Do you want to say hi to our friends?

92
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,231
Are you gonna point it at Mom?

93
00:03:40,231 --> 00:03:42,161
Okay, you hold it still.

94
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:45,331
Okay, so this was, her
name was Alice Jeanette,

95
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:47,613
was my great grandma that lived to be 102.

96
00:03:47,613 --> 00:03:49,082
So there's a picture of her,

97
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,815
but this is a better one.

98
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:52,504
First, that was my mom's mom.

99
00:03:52,504 --> 00:03:53,637
Is she not elegant?

100
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:55,396
- [Calvin] Yeah that's mommy's mommy.

101
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:56,609
- Yeah, that's Mommy's mom.

102
00:03:56,609 --> 00:03:58,769
Isn't that, she is so elegant.

103
00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:01,297
But this was her mom, right there,

104
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:02,857
right there, Alice Jeanette.
- Mommy.

105
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,794
- Isn't that a cute name?

106
00:04:04,794 --> 00:04:05,627
- [Calvin] Yeah.

107
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:06,460
- That is so cute.

108
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,564
Are you happier,

109
00:04:08,564 --> 00:04:10,434
now that you got to film?

110
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,297
- Yeah.

111
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:13,827
(babbling)

112
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:16,494
- Calvin, oh good morning buddy.

113
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,172
- Mine.

114
00:04:19,173 --> 00:04:20,250
- Oh is that yours?

115
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,083
- Yeah.

116
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,293
- Okay boys, I have a question for you.

117
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,470
Jackson what do you want
to be for Halloween?

118
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,104
- Uh I want to be a buzz with no wings.

119
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:30,035
- Buzz with no wings,
that's very specific.

120
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,431
Calvin, do you know what you
want to be for Halloween?

121
00:04:32,431 --> 00:04:35,550
Do you want to be Woody for Halloween?

122
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,383
- Yeah.

123
00:04:36,383 --> 00:04:37,631
- Okay, awesome, very cool.

124
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:41,255
What do you think Dad
should be for Halloween?

125
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:42,625
- A pirate.

126
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,713
- A pirate?

127
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:44,546
That would be fun.

128
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:45,379
What about Mommy?

129
00:04:45,379 --> 00:04:46,212
- Black widow.

130
00:04:46,212 --> 00:04:47,696
- Black widow like last year?

131
00:04:47,696 --> 00:04:48,529
- Yeah.

132
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:49,369
- That would be so much fun.

133
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:52,088
Mommy and I are gonna see
what we can figure out

134
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,984
to wear for Halloween.

135
00:04:53,984 --> 00:04:54,984
Woo, spooky.

136
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,276
Boston, hi bud, how are you?

137
00:04:58,276 --> 00:04:59,109
- Hi.

138
00:04:59,109 --> 00:04:59,942
- High fives.

139
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:01,042
What do you want to be for Halloween?

140
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:01,875
- Hulk.

141
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:02,708
- [Jared] Hulk.

142
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:04,504
Show me a Hulk smash right now.

143
00:05:04,504 --> 00:05:05,410
Boom!

144
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,186
Alright kiddos, let's go.

145
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:08,370
I feel like I'm herding cats here,

146
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,203
it's been like 10 minutes,

147
00:05:09,203 --> 00:05:10,972
trying to get these kids upstairs.

148
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:12,803
Let's go guys, come one, we're gonna go.

149
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:14,668
Tonight we have a Halloween party

150
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:15,531
- Mwaaaa.

151
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:18,478
- and having a great Halloween costume

152
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,765
is one thing, but having a
great couples Halloween costume

153
00:05:22,765 --> 00:05:23,598
- It's hard.

154
00:05:23,598 --> 00:05:24,564
- That's another thing.

155
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,750
So we're going to the
Halloween Store right now.

156
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:30,024
And we're gonna find the
best Halloween costume ever

157
00:05:30,024 --> 00:05:31,366
for couples.
- Cause it's no kids,

158
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,199
- couples only.

159
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,032
We're doing this.
- Mmm-mmm.

160
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:34,146
- We're doing it now.

161
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:35,197
- I did the poop emoji.

162
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:36,076
(Jared laughs)

163
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,481
- [Jared] We're doing this, aren't we?

164
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:39,207
(laughing)

165
00:05:39,207 --> 00:05:41,381
- I've never been into a
Halloween store like this.

166
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,214
- [Jared] What?

167
00:05:42,214 --> 00:05:45,472
Okay, here you go, here's
your poop emoji costume.

168
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:48,666
I feel like there should be a blow up one,

169
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,844
one that's even better.

170
00:05:49,844 --> 00:05:51,516
Oh here's your costume Ellie.

171
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:52,824
There you go.

172
00:05:52,824 --> 00:05:53,657
(laughing)

173
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:54,490
- [Recorded Voice] What
are we gonna do Rick?

174
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,323
We're so screwed.

175
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:56,964
He's gonna get to the ship
and smash the microverse

176
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:59,047
and then he's gonna kill

177
00:06:00,238 --> 00:06:01,512
- What is it?

178
00:06:01,512 --> 00:06:03,168
- It's Morty.

179
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:04,862
It's from Rick and Morty.
- Oh the one I don't like.

180
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:06,095
- [Jared] You're never seen it.

181
00:06:06,095 --> 00:06:06,928
- Yes I don't like it.

182
00:06:06,928 --> 00:06:08,029
- [Jared] You can't form
an opinion on something

183
00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:09,507
that you've never seen, Ellie.

184
00:06:09,507 --> 00:06:12,275
So if you want to be like extra clean

185
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:15,329
on this Halloween, you've
got yourself a loofah,

186
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:17,709
okay, and if you're a little hungry,

187
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,618
you've got your PB & J,

188
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:21,106
you've got your bacon and egg,

189
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:22,538
you've got your giant pickle.

190
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:23,371
- Eww.

191
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:24,204
- [Jared] Do you want
a pickle for a nickel.

192
00:06:24,204 --> 00:06:26,953
Or, just your regular
old ketchup and mustard.

193
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,714
Those are some great couples costumes.

194
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:31,852
Yum, are those some good green beans?

195
00:06:31,852 --> 00:06:32,747
Are those good?

196
00:06:32,747 --> 00:06:35,438
Yeah, yum yum yum yum yum.

197
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:38,545
Ooh here, let's put some ketchup on them.

198
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:40,264
(cheek squirts)

199
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:41,733
Now take a bite.

200
00:06:41,733 --> 00:06:43,745
Ooh, is that good?

201
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:44,578
Is that good?

202
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,497
- No, it's not real.

203
00:06:46,497 --> 00:06:49,267
- Oh, where is your imagination young man?

204
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:53,386
Your imagination makes
everything possible.

205
00:06:53,386 --> 00:06:54,778
- It's not real.

206
00:06:54,778 --> 00:06:56,138
- Well we need to watch Hook.

207
00:06:56,138 --> 00:06:57,936
Because they have a magnificent piece,

208
00:06:57,936 --> 00:06:58,790
- That's not real!

209
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,100
- That you would not believe
with their imagination.

210
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,585
Now guess what Jackson.

211
00:07:03,585 --> 00:07:06,273
Mommy and Daddy, we went and we got

212
00:07:06,273 --> 00:07:08,856
some super super cool costumes.

213
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:12,001
Did you know that?

214
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:12,834
- Yeah.

215
00:07:12,834 --> 00:07:13,667
I want to see them.

216
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,023
- I'll show you in just a minute, okay?

217
00:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,514
It might be a surprise
for you though alright?

218
00:07:18,514 --> 00:07:19,517
And it might be a surprise for you,

219
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:22,213
because we got more than one costume,

220
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:24,029
because we've got some fun activities

221
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:25,077
the rest of this month,

222
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:26,458
and we don't want to spoil all of them,

223
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:27,291
all at once,

224
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,124
so here in a little bit,

225
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:29,257
we're gonna show you what we're wearing

226
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:30,131
to this party, okay?

227
00:07:30,131 --> 00:07:33,939
- I just want to see them right now.

228
00:07:33,939 --> 00:07:35,324
- Okay, so what do you think we should do

229
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,157
if you want to see 'em.

230
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:37,862
- Thumbs up if you want to see them.

231
00:07:37,862 --> 00:07:40,059
- Okay, thumbs up if you want to see them.

232
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,809
(dramatic music)

233
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:49,335
(heavy breathing)

234
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,588
- [Ellie] Spiderman vs. Batman,

235
00:07:53,588 --> 00:07:56,088
Jackson are you gonna get him?

236
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,522
(groaning)

237
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,232
(laughing)

238
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,931
(groaning)

239
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,389
(Ellie laughs)

240
00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:10,056
(uptempo music)

241
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,748
- Um so I'm not quite sure how this mask

242
00:08:22,748 --> 00:08:25,061
is working out, but I'm Batman.

243
00:08:25,061 --> 00:08:26,478
I'm Batman.
- A little lumpy head.

244
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,107
- I'm Batman.

245
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:28,940
- He's lumpy head Batman.

246
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,412
- You look like a dinosaur.

247
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:31,578
(laughing)

248
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:32,410
- Nice.

249
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,504
- Dude do you guys want to trade costumes?

250
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,721
- Sure, I'll take this.

251
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:36,969
- [Ellie] This is $50 dollars.

252
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:37,986
- I just need this real quick.

253
00:08:37,986 --> 00:08:38,958
- [Ellie] Look at my hair.

254
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,791
- There we go.

255
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:42,048
- You just broke the tip of my crayon off.

256
00:08:42,048 --> 00:08:43,232
- Sorry, we just need to sharpen you

257
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,113
a little bit, that's all.

258
00:08:45,113 --> 00:08:46,223
(laughing)

259
00:08:46,223 --> 00:08:47,056
- Give me that.

260
00:08:47,056 --> 00:08:47,889
- So we made it to the party

261
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,079
and I'm super excited to see
all of the couples costumes.

262
00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:54,142
So we're superheros, Ellie,
if you couldn't tell.

263
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,213
I'm Batman, I know it's hard to tell.

264
00:08:56,213 --> 00:08:57,046
- I'm Wonder Woman.

265
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:59,736
- Ellie's Wonder Woman
and we've got Crayons,

266
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,255
isn't that cool?
- A crayon box.

267
00:09:01,255 --> 00:09:02,088
- Crayola.

268
00:09:02,088 --> 00:09:03,927
- Yeah, so I'm excited to
see everyone else's costumes.

269
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:05,576
So we've got Dusty and Jayce over here,

270
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,341
what are you guys?

271
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,249
So I'm guessing, wait, Jon Snow,

272
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:11,571
that was my guess, right?

273
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:12,489
- Yep.

274
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:13,322
- [Jared] Awesome.

275
00:09:13,322 --> 00:09:14,155
- That's a good guess.

276
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:14,988
- [Jared] And what was yours?

277
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,152
- I'm Ravenna from The Huntsman.

278
00:09:17,152 --> 00:09:19,891
- [Jared] Ooh looks awesome guys.

279
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:21,520
Looks so good.

280
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,071
- You gotta get my sword.

281
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:24,436
- Oh yeah yeah yeah.
- Oh man.

282
00:09:24,436 --> 00:09:26,038
- The sword's the best part.
- Um, Ellie,

283
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,331
- [Jared] where's your sword?

284
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:29,355
You guys need to sword fight.

285
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:30,188
- Yes.

286
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:31,021
- Oh yeah.

287
00:09:31,021 --> 00:09:31,976
- Yours is huge.
- Something tells me

288
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,136
(laughing)

289
00:09:33,136 --> 00:09:33,969
- Put mine away.

290
00:09:33,969 --> 00:09:36,469
- Malia the mermaid and Gumby.

291
00:09:37,752 --> 00:09:40,152
Let's get in there, let's get in there

292
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:41,849
oh my gosh,

293
00:09:41,849 --> 00:09:43,245
so fresh, so cool.

294
00:09:43,245 --> 00:09:45,304
Hey Gumby, why don't
you slide on over there.

295
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:47,080
(laughing)

296
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,242
That's so cool.

297
00:09:48,242 --> 00:09:50,575
♫ Halloween

298
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:55,338
(spooky rock music)

299
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:56,505
Go for a bite.

300
00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:00,239
♫ Halloween

301
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,674
- [Dusty] Commit to it, commit to it.

302
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:03,924
(laughing)

303
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,108
(laughing)

304
00:10:12,085 --> 00:10:13,963
- Oh my gosh.

305
00:10:13,963 --> 00:10:14,796
- Woo!

306
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:18,387
Oh.

307
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,373
No, they've got it.

308
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:26,623
Oh my gosh, no.

309
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:29,737
What?

310
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:31,192
Oh my gosh.

311
00:10:31,192 --> 00:10:33,041
It kept breaking.

312
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:35,388
- We were good, we totally

313
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:37,490
- Our team won though.

314
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:38,407
Who was it?

315
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:42,699
- If this was two-ply, we would've won.

316
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:43,879
(laughing)

317
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,462
- Never have I ever

318
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,578
- [Ellie] I have something
funny that I just thought of.

319
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:51,440
- shaved my legs.

320
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,690
(laughing)

321
00:10:55,596 --> 00:10:56,836
- Everybody got up.

322
00:10:56,836 --> 00:11:00,278
- Never have I ever taken my underwear

323
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,382
inside out reworn it inside out.

324
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:03,215
- Totally.

325
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,491
- Oh my god.

326
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,231
- Jared you totally have.

327
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,064
- I've never done

328
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:09,128
- [Ellie] Yes you have.

329
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:10,595
- I've never done it inside out.

330
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:12,753
Backwards though.
- An accident though?

331
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:14,407
- You're on vacation and
you're like oh crap, I'm out,

332
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,766
I'll just wear it inside out.

333
00:11:15,766 --> 00:11:16,999
- I think it was this morning.

334
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:17,967
(Jared laughing)

335
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:21,300
- Oh I totally have had braces, oh yeah.

336
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:24,445
Ellie you haven't had braces.

337
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,251
- Yes I did, Invisalign.

338
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:28,340
- [Jared] Oh good point, good point.

339
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,291
I never knew, because they were invisible.

340
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:31,124
- Oh.

341
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:31,957
(laughing)

342
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,318
- Never have I ever cheated on a test.

343
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,568
(laughing)

344
00:11:38,318 --> 00:11:40,568
- Howdy doodly there?

345
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:43,641
Well now I know who's
honest in this group.

346
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:44,880
- [Woman] Now I know who I can trust.

347
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,515
- Never have I ever birthed a child.

348
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:51,098
- [Jared] Oh that's a good one.

349
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:55,679
Wait, wait a second.

350
00:11:58,188 --> 00:11:59,438
How are you up?

351
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,738
How did you get up there?

352
00:12:02,738 --> 00:12:06,772
Wait is this the Arnold
Schwartzenegger movie?

353
00:12:06,772 --> 00:12:08,287
- Junior.
- Junior?

354
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:09,991
- I'm never playing your
style of gain again.

355
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:13,010
- Never have I ever pooped my pants

356
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,771
as an adult.

357
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,438
- Aww man.
- Ah shit.

358
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:18,282
- Sorry.

359
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:19,951
Oh crap.

360
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:23,505
(laughing)

361
00:12:23,505 --> 00:12:25,192
I didn't see everyone who got up on that,

362
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:27,376
I'm gonna have to watch that again.

363
00:12:27,376 --> 00:12:29,209
Waa waa, party's over.

364
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:32,030
Thank you Malia and
Brady for having us over.

365
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,253
It was so much fun.

366
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,490
Never have I ever,

367
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,785
was that the funnest part?
- That was a fun game.

368
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:38,112
- It was hilarious.
- Yes it was.

369
00:12:38,112 --> 00:12:39,879
- I think I won on the toilet paper thing,

370
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:41,042
spinning my body really fast.

371
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:42,826
- [Jared] You were so quick.

372
00:12:42,826 --> 00:12:44,511
You were mummified so fast.
- Did you see that?

373
00:12:44,511 --> 00:12:45,610
- [Jared] Oh my gosh,
it was something else.

374
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,826
- We totally sucked.

375
00:12:46,826 --> 00:12:48,549
I thought you were gonna win for sure.

376
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,359
- He did really good and then I came.

377
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:51,736
- Joel and I had the right idea,

378
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,253
we had the right idea,

379
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:55,039
and the toilet paper was one-play,

380
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,567
so anything you did it ripped.

381
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,400
- Yeah, it was really cheap.

382
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
- It was really cheap toilet paper.

383
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,674
- [Joel] It wasn't Charmin.

384
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:00,810
- Yeah exactly.
- It broke.

385
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:04,082
- At any rate, I think that us four,

386
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:05,865
I think we had the best
costumes of the night.

387
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:07,337
Wouldn't you agree?

388
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:09,561
- I don't know, the Game
of Thrones was really good.

389
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:11,287
- That was, yeah, Jon
Snow was pretty good.

390
00:13:11,287 --> 00:13:12,120
- Yeah.

391
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,953
- But let us know who you thought

392
00:13:12,953 --> 00:13:14,697
had the best costumes

393
00:13:14,697 --> 00:13:16,473
and also, if we should
do different costumes

394
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:17,306
for Halloween.

395
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:18,617
Let us know what we should do

396
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,809

00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:22,497

to give you a prize.

401
00:13:27,388 --> 00:13:28,540
If you guys want to do that,

402
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,523
I think this is something we're gonna

403
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:31,211
try to do a little more.

404
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,747
