1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,518
- There's something even more important

2
00:00:01,518 --> 00:00:03,246
and cool that I wanna show you.

3
00:00:03,246 --> 00:00:04,085
Wow!

4
00:00:04,085 --> 00:00:05,050
(laughs)

5
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,009
Changed our life!

6
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:09,801
- Potty dance, potty dance!

7
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:10,739
- Yeah!

8
00:00:10,739 --> 00:00:11,572
- Good morning guys!

9
00:00:11,572 --> 00:00:14,463
It is time for a brand new awesome day.

10
00:00:14,463 --> 00:00:19,038
We are cleaning up after
our Super Bowl Extravaganza.

11
00:00:19,038 --> 00:00:22,080
We got the vacuum going,
we got the kids over here

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,144
I gotta tell you this real quick.

13
00:00:24,144 --> 00:00:26,452
So, when Landon and Julie

14
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:29,191
come into your life
- Oh dear

15
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,425
- They do some incredible things.

16
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:32,753
They turn your life upside down

17
00:00:32,753 --> 00:00:33,985
- They make your house a mess,

18
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:35,337
- No no no
- They eat your food

19
00:00:35,337 --> 00:00:37,654
- No no no, listen to this.

20
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,030
Ellie and I have lived in this house

21
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,998
for like year and a half now

22
00:00:40,998 --> 00:00:43,616
and we've never made a
change like you have.

23
00:00:43,616 --> 00:00:45,146
- What do you mean?

24
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:47,056
- Do you see our couches?

25
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:48,160
Look at this!

26
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,495
There's some much more
room for activities!

27
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:52,112
You just opened that couch up, you're like

28
00:00:52,112 --> 00:00:53,775
"Oh yeah we can fit more people here,

29
00:00:53,775 --> 00:00:55,120
we can watch the Super Bowl"

30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,537
Changed our life.

31
00:00:57,386 --> 00:01:00,919
thank you for being here
and making this change

32
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:02,020
- Thank you.

33
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,588
- Julie's had plenty of
opportunities to rearrange homes so

34
00:01:05,588 --> 00:01:06,622
(Jared laughs)

35
00:01:06,622 --> 00:01:09,303
- Did you guys have so
much fun with your cousins?

36
00:01:09,303 --> 00:01:10,404
Yeah?

37
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,125
Oh, are you going to sleep?

38
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,879
Let's be so quiet, he's going to sleep

39
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,712
Okay yeah, we gotta be quiet okay?

40
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,177
Oh he's out like a light, he is so tired.

41
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,187
He is so tired, he's so tired,

42
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:31,221
let's make sure he sleeps so good.

43
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,493
Okay Calvin, we have been working

44
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:34,218
really really hard with potty training.

45
00:01:34,218 --> 00:01:35,517
We've been doing some great things

46
00:01:35,517 --> 00:01:37,069
we've had some ups and downs,

47
00:01:37,069 --> 00:01:38,669
and I've got something here for you

48
00:01:38,669 --> 00:01:40,125
that I think you're going to love

49
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:41,549
and it's going to help
you with potty training.

50
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:42,845
Do you want to see it?

51
00:01:42,845 --> 00:01:43,692
- Mhm.

52
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,532
- Okay, so look here.

53
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:48,199
I've got a potty training watch!

54
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,693
- Yeah!

55
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,526
- Do you want it?

56
00:01:51,526 --> 00:01:52,359
- Mhm.

57
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:54,469
- Okay, now let's put it on your wrist.

58
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:56,886
So what this does - here
let's turn it this way -

59
00:01:56,886 --> 00:02:00,637
Is this will tell you when
to go sit on the potty.

60
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:02,566
So when it sings its song,

61
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:05,308
it means okay let's go sit on the potty!

62
00:02:05,308 --> 00:02:07,073
It's your potty watch!

63
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:09,596
So we'll set the timer,

64
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,086
it's singing!

65
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:12,277
What does that mean?

66
00:02:12,277 --> 00:02:14,661
Let's go sit on the potty!

67
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:16,277
Let's go sit on the potty, it's singing,

68
00:02:16,277 --> 00:02:17,526
let's go sit on the potty!

69
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:18,359
Yeah!

70
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,525
Okay, we've got it all set up.

71
00:02:21,525 --> 00:02:25,366
So what it is, is, it's a
watch that has a timer on it

72
00:02:25,366 --> 00:02:28,701
it goes in 30 minutes, 60
minutes, 90 minute intervals

73
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:30,245
and we have it set to 30 minutes

74
00:02:30,245 --> 00:02:31,525
he just went for a little bit

75
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,821
we're gonna try again in 30 minutes.

76
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:34,469
But as soon as you hear the song,

77
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:35,949
where do you go?

78
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,483
Yeah, we used it on the potty!

79
00:02:37,483 --> 00:02:38,882
Good job, bud!

80
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:39,956
- It's not gonna work

81
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:41,117
- Well guess what?

82
00:02:41,117 --> 00:02:43,496
It only plays when he has to go potty.

83
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,996
Did you know that?

84
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:47,397
Magic.

85
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:48,787
Okay, so when it plays again,

86
00:02:48,787 --> 00:02:50,540
you sit on the potty, okay bud?

87
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,838
Hold it up in the air and say "Yeah"

88
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:52,891
- Yeah!

89
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,900
- (laughs)

90
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,172
Oh hey there, those are some
nice shoes you got on there,

91
00:02:57,172 --> 00:03:00,112
do you think they fit you pretty well?

92
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:02,526
- Actually they don't.

93
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:03,746
- They don't?

94
00:03:03,746 --> 00:03:05,221
They don't fit you, why?

95
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:06,852
- Because they're big.

96
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,110
- They're too big?

97
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,461
Oh I don't know, I think
they look pretty good on you.

98
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,659
- No they're yours.

99
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:12,644
- Oh they're mine?

100
00:03:12,644 --> 00:03:14,212
Okay, I'll put them on.

101
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,660
A little slipperoo here,

102
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,117
a little slipperoo there.

103
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:22,383
I love shoes that you can slip on.

104
00:03:22,383 --> 00:03:23,843
Like whether they have laces or not,

105
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:25,747
but if you can slip the shoes on,

106
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,588
it just makes it so nice.

107
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:31,029
I love, I just love to slip my shoes on.

108
00:03:31,029 --> 00:03:32,132
You know, I just love it.

109
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:33,155
- Poo!

110
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:34,188
- Poo?

111
00:03:34,188 --> 00:03:36,445
- You farted in your pants!

112
00:03:36,445 --> 00:03:38,604
- Look, they can't smell it,

113
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:40,074
so they don't have to know about it!

114
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:42,429
Don't reveal my secrets, guys!

115
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:45,962
Come on, you're on my team guys, be real.

116
00:03:45,962 --> 00:03:48,062
Get with the picture.

117
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:50,273
Let's be on the same team, the same sides.

118
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:53,033
- Potty dance, potty dance!

119
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:55,903
Guys we are so happy over here!

120
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,741
Our neighbor, I think Jared
may have told you guys,

121
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:00,741
- It's dead!

122
00:04:01,703 --> 00:04:03,870
- Whoa, let me look at it!

123
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:07,055
How many more minutes?

124
00:04:07,055 --> 00:04:08,501
28 more minutes!

125
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,560
My neighbor the other day told us that her

126
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,299
girl they just potty trained and that

127
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,625
she didn't like the potty watch.

128
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,478
Woo, you okay?

129
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,311
You okay?

130
00:04:19,312 --> 00:04:20,935
You just ran into my leg.

131
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,489
That she didn't like it, and so

132
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,208
she's letting us have it for Calvin

133
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,393
and this morning we've had no accidents!

134
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,697
And he's been going, good job!

135
00:04:30,697 --> 00:04:32,447
I am so proud of you.

136
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:34,755
Good job, Calvin!

137
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,073
You're welcome, what did you say?

138
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,318
Say thanks Mom.

139
00:04:40,318 --> 00:04:41,401
- Thanks Mom.

140
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,619
- I'm so proud of him.

141
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,401
Good job, and Jackson's
been cheering him on.

142
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:52,227
So, so far, that potty
watch has done really great.

143
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,787
And you guys even told us, you're like

144
00:04:53,787 --> 00:04:56,233
"Ellie you should try
the potty watch for him"

145
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:58,171
which I wanted to look into but

146
00:04:58,171 --> 00:05:02,932
Yay for awesome neighbors
that will let you have theirs.

147
00:05:02,932 --> 00:05:05,015
(laughs)

148
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:07,575
Are we ready to go?

149
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,046
Good girl Penny!

150
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,191
We just have to run an errand.

151
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,398
- And then hammer throw.

152
00:05:18,398 --> 00:05:19,821
- Guess who just went to the potty again?

153
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,614
- You did a good job Mom!

154
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,071
- (laughs) Oh my gosh.

155
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,662
- What are you doing?

156
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:26,758
- We're playing with the
scooters and I got Jackson.

157
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:29,776
- You guys are literally
playing chicken right now.

158
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,568
Okay, who's going to win?

159
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:32,611
- I want a bike.

160
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:34,046
- You want a bike?

161
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:35,562
- I want a different, I want a scooter.

162
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:37,523
- Okay, change up your vehicle,

163
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:40,318
and then you can go Round Two with Boston.

164
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:42,563
Okay, just be very careful, Jackson.

165
00:05:42,563 --> 00:05:45,345
On your mark, get set, go!

166
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,566
(laughs)

167
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:49,649
Oh no, he's overpowering!

168
00:05:52,756 --> 00:05:54,957
Hey, are you guys playing chicken too?

169
00:05:54,957 --> 00:05:56,612
I think they both lost that one.

170
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:58,418
Here we go, catch it!

171
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:00,860
Oh it bounced right off of you!

172
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,258
Okay throw it back here and
I'll throw it to Boston.

173
00:06:04,258 --> 00:06:05,841
Whoa, got it, yeah!

174
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:07,843
Ready, Boston?

175
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:08,676
- Yeah!

176
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,062
- Oh, so close!

177
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,846
Okay throw it here!

178
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:15,679
- Okay!

179
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,781
- Yeah!

180
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:19,804
Going down the slide
to see if you catch air

181
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:20,721
- It's wet.

182
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:23,298
- Oh, hurry and go down so it dries.

183
00:06:23,298 --> 00:06:24,465
Yeah!

184
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:26,132
Three, two, one, go!

185
00:06:27,716 --> 00:06:28,549
Woo!

186
00:06:30,107 --> 00:06:31,118
Was that fun?

187
00:06:31,118 --> 00:06:31,951
High five.

188
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:34,275
So Calvin has only had one accident today

189
00:06:34,275 --> 00:06:37,409
we put on the potty watch and at first,

190
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:39,480
it was like a miracle in the making.

191
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,380
So Calvin loved it.

192
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,773
He loved it.

193
00:06:42,773 --> 00:06:44,618
as soon as he heard the song,

194
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:47,478
he wanted to take his drawers down

195
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,910
he wanted to go potty all by himself.

196
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,257
He didn't want any interference.

197
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,920
He didn't want us to touch
him, he wanted to do it.

198
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,824
I feel like Calvin's pretty independent,

199
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:58,066
he wants to do things by himself.

200
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:01,671
But, as time has gone on today,
throughout the afternoon,

201
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,004
Calvin hears the music and he runs away.

202
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,193
(laughs)

203
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:12,282
So, the song just went off, and
he ran and hid in the corner

204
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:15,319
so there's definitely some work
to be done with this watch.

205
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:18,151
Alright bub, it's your turn.

206
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:19,751
Stand up, there we go.

207
00:07:19,751 --> 00:07:21,127
Whoopsie daisy there we go!

208
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,783
Okay, we're doing haircuts.

209
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:26,151
Jackson it's your turn buddy.

210
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:27,143
- No!

211
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:29,407
- Yes, you ready for your haircut?

212
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,321
Calvin's already done, it's your turn.

213
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:33,535
Do you guys wanna see what Jackson

214
00:07:33,535 --> 00:07:34,568
looks like when he's scared?

215
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:35,920
- Whoa!

216
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,753
- (laughs)

217
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:37,586
- Whoa!

218
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:39,798
Not too scared are you?

219
00:07:39,798 --> 00:07:40,631
Whoa!

220
00:07:41,615 --> 00:07:46,072
Okay Jackson, do you want
the bowl cut or the Mohawk?

221
00:07:46,072 --> 00:07:48,215
Or the hard part?

222
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,493
- The good part.

223
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:50,519
- [Jared] The good part?

224
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,656
Just a good part.

225
00:07:51,656 --> 00:07:52,489
- [Ellie] I agree.

226
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,716
- [Jared] No Mohawks today?

227
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,085
Oh, you want to cut the hair?

228
00:07:56,085 --> 00:07:58,222
Is that what you're trying to do?

229
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:00,008
- No, I want to cut the hair.

230
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,432
- [Ellie] Oh, no.

231
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:02,516
Put those down, Cal.

232
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,664
- [Jared] Mommy's a professional

233
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:07,171
Hey there mister man (laughs)

234
00:08:07,171 --> 00:08:09,153
I was going to show you
the kids' haircuts but

235
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:12,299
we got them to bed because
they were ready for bed

236
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:14,579
but this is my haircut, looks pretty good,

237
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,883
but there's something
even more important and

238
00:08:16,883 --> 00:08:18,283
cool that I want to show you.

239
00:08:18,283 --> 00:08:20,779
Actually I'm not sure if it's cool

240
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:23,636
or if it's embarrassing, but,

241
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,372
the story goes like this:

242
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,122
Exactly one year ago,

243
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:30,754
someone showed up to my door.

244
00:08:30,754 --> 00:08:32,042
They knocked on the door and said

245
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,971
"Hey, we have a delivery for Jared Mecham"

246
00:08:34,971 --> 00:08:39,268
I looked outside, and lo and
behold, it was Dr. Pepper.

247
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,673
Dr. Pepper came to my
house with a delivery

248
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:45,133
with a pallet full of Dr. Pepper cases.

249
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,508
One year ago today.

250
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:50,398
And I'd like to show you
what remains after one year

251
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:53,678
of Dr. Pepper consumption and giving away.

252
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:56,063
So what we did, what Ellie and I did,

253
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,846
any time we had a party,

254
00:08:57,846 --> 00:09:00,620
any time we went somewhere
to visit someone,

255
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:03,302
we gave them a case of Dr. Pepper.

256
00:09:03,302 --> 00:09:06,364
So, more than half of those Dr. Peppers

257
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,855
were given away and then the rest of them

258
00:09:08,855 --> 00:09:12,454
were used here at parties,
and me editing late at night

259
00:09:12,454 --> 00:09:15,966
falling asleep with Dr.
Pepper, that sounded weird.

260
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,846
Anyway, this is what I have left

261
00:09:17,846 --> 00:09:20,483
after one full year of Dr. Pepper.

262
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:21,705
Boom.

263
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:23,452
Four cases.

264
00:09:23,452 --> 00:09:25,884
I actually have probably a case,

265
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:28,492
maybe a case and a half
upstairs in my office,

266
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:31,973
But one year ago, we had this whole wall

267
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:35,354
full of Dr. Pepper, and
that is what's left.

268
00:09:35,354 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm going to insert a
picture from Instagram

269
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,444
where I had it, because it was like

270
00:09:40,444 --> 00:09:42,181
the same week as the Super Bowl,

271
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,949
which was perfect timing because we had

272
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,956
another Super Bowl party last year

273
00:09:46,956 --> 00:09:48,589
and we had tons of Dr. Pepper.

274
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,684
But I'll put the Instagram picture here

275
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:51,660
and if you guys aren't
following me on Instagram,

276
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,646
I'll have a link to it
here, just follow me,

277
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:56,157
Jared Mecham, but this is the picture

278
00:09:56,157 --> 00:09:59,135
of me in my Dr. Pepper throne.

279
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:01,701
But I have to say, thank you Dr. Pepper,

280
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,973
that was the coolest surprise that anyone

281
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:06,526
could ever get from Dr. Pepper.

282
00:10:06,526 --> 00:10:10,084
Except for maybe that one time
that girl got the fountain,

283
00:10:10,084 --> 00:10:12,476
the Dr. Pepper fountain,
that was pretty cool.

284
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,861
Like I said, I'm not sure
if that's embarrassing

285
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:17,908
or cool that we have that much Dr. Pepper?

286
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,234
I think Dr. Pepper noticing our

287
00:10:19,234 --> 00:10:20,596
conversations is pretty cool.

288
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:23,907
You know, today I had some
big expectations with Calvin

289
00:10:23,907 --> 00:10:25,846
and potty training with the potty watch.

290
00:10:25,846 --> 00:10:27,814
I really thought that

291
00:10:27,814 --> 00:10:30,807
he would really take ahold of
this and this would be like

292
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:33,807
the best potty training helper ever,

293
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:38,030
and he liked it, and he
did a good job with it.

294
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,429
But it just seemed like

295
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,246
whenever I was with him and everything,

296
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:43,560
it just didn't really work out

297
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,801
He just didn't really want to as much.

298
00:10:45,801 --> 00:10:48,120
But where I found out like the key

299
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,289
to like breaking through with
Calvin and potty training

300
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,895
is when Ellie was around.

301
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,288
- (laughs)

302
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:58,429
- Any time that Calvin was
with Ellie, he would go potty.

303
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,975
If it was with me he
was like "Nope, sorry"

304
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:03,623
- Well and I gotta give
credit to Jackson too

305
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:05,552
because every time the watch went off,

306
00:11:05,552 --> 00:11:08,293
Jackson would go, "Calvin! Yay!"

307
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,180
- Yeah.

308
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,972
- and he was, Jackson's more
excited about it than Calvin

309
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:17,094
and that makes Calvin excited.

310
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,469
So, there was a few times that Calvin was

311
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:22,749
just done for the night and we

312
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,670
we are just going very slow.

313
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,421
He is doing 10 times better
than he was 10 days ago

314
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,766
so I'm just going to tell myself,

315
00:11:30,766 --> 00:11:34,213
If we can get him on the
potty a few times a day,

316
00:11:34,213 --> 00:11:37,575
I am so happy, and today
he only had one accident

317
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,269
so I'm very proud of him.

318
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,348
- And like the thing with potty training

319
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:43,955
you cannot force them.

320
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:46,155
Like they won't do it,
you can't force them,

321
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:47,878
it has to be a decision that they make

322
00:11:47,878 --> 00:11:49,539
and that is where this has helped

323
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:50,909
he's so excited about it

324
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:52,613
because Jackson's excited about it

325
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:55,144
and it's a cyclical thing
but the other thing is like

326
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:57,892
this is nice because it
has timers for 30 minutes,

327
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,901
60 minutes and 90 minutes,

328
00:11:59,901 --> 00:12:01,837
we had it set to 30 minutes because

329
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:04,667
we just didn't want to
miss any opportunity

330
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:07,180
but I can't figure out how to turn it off

331
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:10,052
it's 10 o'clock and this is
going off every 30 minutes

332
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:11,505
- Put it in your office for the night

333
00:12:11,505 --> 00:12:12,643
- I know seriously like stuff it

334
00:12:12,643 --> 00:12:14,611
under the pillow in my office

335
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,219
- Who else is potty training right now

336
00:12:16,219 --> 00:12:18,773
and they're doing it, just,
they're on their phone?

337
00:12:18,773 --> 00:12:22,355
I have so many friends, Julie, Jen,

338
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,553
and neighbors, like everyone's
potty training right now.

339
00:12:25,553 --> 00:12:28,204
A lot of people just put
alarms on their phones

340
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,604
I haven't done that and that's
actually been nice for me

341
00:12:30,604 --> 00:12:33,412
because I'm like, oh it's
been 30 minutes, yeah, Calvin

342
00:12:33,412 --> 00:12:36,493
- You know the one thing Siri
is good for is setting alarms.

343
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,485
I don't know how Apple's keeping up,

344
00:12:38,485 --> 00:12:40,565
they're not keeping up
with the competition like

345
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:44,702
Alexa and Google Assistant
are kicking Apple's butt.

346
00:12:44,702 --> 00:12:47,100
I don't know how the Home
Pod is even going to compete.

347
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,828
Because, anyway, that's
totally off subject but,

348
00:12:50,828 --> 00:12:52,436
I've got to figure out
how to turn this off.

349
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:53,868
- He looks so cute wearing it.

350
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:56,220
- Yeah he does, he really, really does.

351
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,756
He really does look cute
with his little watch on.

352
00:12:58,756 --> 00:13:01,179
- You can tell I'm like, ready for bed

353
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:04,451
Every kid is so different
with potty training.

354
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,693
With Calvin so far, the things

355
00:13:06,693 --> 00:13:08,740
that have helped the most with us,

356
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,395
is getting him his own small potty

357
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,700
and the potty watch like even though,

358
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,796
(laughs) that's going off,

359
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,579
even though we just got it today,

360
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,453
I would say those are the two things

361
00:13:18,453 --> 00:13:21,420
that I've enjoyed the most and side note,

362
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,650
obviously getting some
prizes when he goes potty

363
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,438
he really likes that, not candy,

364
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,327
he likes getting like a small prize.

365
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:30,668
So that's what we have loved the most

366
00:13:30,668 --> 00:13:33,541
and then obviously just them
wanting to go on their own

367
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,757
if he doesn't need to
go, he gets flustered,

368
00:13:35,757 --> 00:13:38,452
and then I've learned not
to even push it and just

369
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:42,261
continue to go even 10
minutes later ask again, so.

370
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:45,614
That's what's helped me the
most, and Calvin the most.

371
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,901
- I think just having you
around has helped Calvin

372
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:51,245
- And having me around,
and Jackson's so excited.

373
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:54,223
Thank you guys so much for
watching our Vlog today

374
00:13:54,223 --> 00:13:57,499
we're going to keep on keeping
on with potty training, guys

375
00:13:57,499 --> 00:14:00,477
thank you guys so much and
we'll see you guys tomorrow.

376
00:14:00,477 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye!
