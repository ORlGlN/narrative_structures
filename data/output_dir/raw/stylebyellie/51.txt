1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,780
- [Ellie] Are we embarrassing
you by singing in public?

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,850
- Boys, come here, I want
to show you something.

3
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:05,940
- Look around.

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,890
- [Ellie] Boys, you can't be back here.

5
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,156
- Oh no, it's the authorities.

6
00:00:08,156 --> 00:00:09,356
- [Both] Best fort ever!

7
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,916
- I'm just, yay, we're gettin' there.

8
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:15,050
And we're building forts and eating pizza!

9
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:16,610
- Good morning guys and happy Monday.

10
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,370
I hope you are having a great day.

11
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,720
I am sitting here in my office

12
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,860
and look, my office is clean
thank goodness gracious.

13
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,240
But Ellie called me and she told me

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,430
to be waiting for her,

15
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,011
because her and the boys have been out

16
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:30,330
running some errands and
doing some grocery shopping

17
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,040
and she informed me that we are about

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,590
to do the world's greatest Sam's Club run

19
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:37,200
of our lifetime.

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,810
We are going to stock
up on a bunch of stuff.

21
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,490
So she told me, she's
like Jared get ready,

22
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,177
and you wait, because
I'm gonna pick you up

23
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,100
and we're gonna go.

24
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,010
So I'm just waiting for Ellie right now

25
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,390
as we get ready to do this ultimate

26
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,425
shopping adventure extravaganza.

27
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,664
(whistling)

28
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:55,259
(groovy chill music)

29
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,459
I don't have a watch on.

30
00:00:59,714 --> 00:01:01,040
Okay, she's here.

31
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,913
Let's go, oh.

32
00:01:02,913 --> 00:01:03,851
Let's go.

33
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,550
Oh, I shouldn't jump, I shouldn't jump.

34
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,010
I've gotta tell you a quick story.

35
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,040
So this morning, I was getting out of bed

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,890
and we have a big pregancy pillow

37
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,910
on the side of our bed

38
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,780
that we are going to use for Ellie.

39
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,680
And I was trying to step over it today,

40
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,730
not to make any sound,

41
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,740
'cause it's in one of those vacuum bags.

42
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,330
'cause Bonnie and Joel had it,

43
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,870
and I stepped over it

44
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,890
and my foot slid out from under me

45
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,250
and my leg went crrruuk, like that.

46
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,240
I hyperextended my knee and my knee

47
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,010
has been killing me all day.

48
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,850
So I don't know if I tore anything,

49
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,200
other than my pants, right?

50
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,043
'Cause I'm wearing ripped jeans.

51
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:41,000
- I like those jeans.

52
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,990
- I think they look pretty good.

53
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,823
I like 'em.

54
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,240
So I can't jump down the stairs,

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,630
because my knee hurts really bad.

56
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,740
Anyway, are you ready for this

57
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,100
extreme extravaganza?
- Yes.

58
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,933
- [Jared] Of shopping.

59
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:51,850
- We are gonna go renew
our Sam's Club card.

60
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,320
- And we are going to stock up.

61
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,730
- Diapers?

62
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,563
- Wipes?

63
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,740
- Q-tips?

64
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,677
- Deodorant?

65
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:00,520
(sniffs)

66
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,595
- Totes.

67
00:02:01,595 --> 00:02:02,677
- Magoats.

68
00:02:02,677 --> 00:02:03,510
(Ellie laughs)

69
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,360
(muffles singing)

70
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,080
- [Ellie] Are we embarrassing
you by singing in public?

71
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,300
- We are fueled up.

72
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,560
We just had lunch and we are ready

73
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,710
to rock and roll.

74
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,380
And we're starting in the
most important place of all.

75
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,540
We are stocking up on
the smelly good stuff,

76
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,270
deodorant, because let's face it Ellie,

77
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,220
we work so hard, we work up a sweat.

78
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,570
And that sweat starts to stink.

79
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,250
- I feel like every time we're like,

80
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,200
we need more, we run out fast,

81
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,690
so we're stocking up just
on everything we need.

82
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,523
- Everything.

83
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:33,743
Every last thing.
- We need more--

84
00:02:33,743 --> 00:02:35,217
- And diapers.

85
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:37,967
- We need more nighttime gummies.

86
00:02:39,996 --> 00:02:42,032
- [Jared] Nighttime gummies?

87
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:42,865
- [Jackson] We ran out.

88
00:02:42,865 --> 00:02:45,349
- We need to get more kids' vitamins, huh?

89
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:46,182
- Uh-huh.

90
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,320
- Yeah that's right.

91
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,898
- [Ellie] You want to make a fort?

92
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:49,731
- Yeah.

93
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:50,564
- [Ellie] Well I don't know if Calvin's

94
00:02:50,564 --> 00:02:51,397
gonna love it or hate it.

95
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,390
- We're gonna put a fort right here.

96
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,230
This is part of the fort.

97
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,130
- I wanna go--

98
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,010
- [Ellie] You wanna sit in the fort.

99
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:57,843
Oh brother.

100
00:02:57,843 --> 00:02:58,676
Oh my gosh.
- Alright,

101
00:02:58,676 --> 00:03:01,060
- [Jared] That was just
piece one of the fort, okay?

102
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,570
- [Ellie] We're gonna cover you guys up.

103
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,050
- There's a piece here and a piece here

104
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,540
and then you'll be golden, okay?

105
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,940
- [Ellie] Are you smelling his head?

106
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,387
- No, I'm sniffing his hair in my nose.

107
00:03:10,387 --> 00:03:13,885
- [Ellie] Why, does it smell good?

108
00:03:13,885 --> 00:03:16,854
- I'm trying to (muffled)--

109
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,170
(Ellie laughs)

110
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,490
- [Ellie] Okay, we have a fort here.

111
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,210
I'm wondering what Dad has going on here.

112
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:26,873
- Boys, come here, I want
to show you something.

113
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,060
- Oh that's a fort?

114
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,100
- [Ellie] Come here.

115
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,110
This is not sponsored by Charmin.

116
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,040
(Ellie laughs)

117
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,530
Ah!

118
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,680
Oh, I'm always left out.

119
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
Alright, are you guys
ready to join the fort?

120
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,010
Let's go, shoop.

121
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,200
- What do we do now?

122
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,158
- [Jared] This is our club
guys, we're in the club house.

123
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:46,991
- Wow.

124
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,110
- Yeah, is this cool or what?

125
00:03:49,344 --> 00:03:50,671
What should we do while we're in here?

126
00:03:50,671 --> 00:03:51,590
- See.

127
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,500
- [Jared] Do you see the bear?

128
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,333
- Yeah.

129
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,246
- [Jared] Yeah.

130
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:55,079
- Look around.

131
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,503
- [Ellie] You boys,
you can't be back here.

132
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:57,630
- Oh no, it's the authorities.

133
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,463
- If you're gonna be back here,

134
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,296
you have to buy every one of them.

135
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,778
- Ahh Mom!

136
00:04:00,778 --> 00:04:02,250
(Ellie growls)

137
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,286
I think someone saw me in here.

138
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:06,710
We have to be so quiet, okay?

139
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,790
We can't let anyone see us.

140
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,957
(yelling)

141
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,490
Ellie, here's the new challenge.

142
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,200
We're staying in Sam's Club for 24 hours,

143
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,769
in our toilet paper fort.

144
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,602
- Okay, goodbye.

145
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:20,435
- Bye.

146
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:22,660
Now let's stay here as
long as we can, okay?

147
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,780
What should we do for a day?

148
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,240
- Do for a day.

149
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,050
- No I don't want to stay here forever.

150
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:29,883
- You don't?

151
00:04:29,883 --> 00:04:30,716
- No.

152
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:32,187
- I thought we were gonna
stay here the whole day.

153
00:04:32,187 --> 00:04:33,187
- [Both] No.

154
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,340
- Why not?

155
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,840
You want to go with Mom then?

156
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,027
- [Calvin] No.

157
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,060
- Oh okay, you do?

158
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,873
Okay.

159
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:41,706
- Hey.

160
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:42,700
- [Jared] You want to stay?

161
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
- Pong.

162
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,102
- [Jared] You want to go?

163
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:46,040
- I'm gonna knock the gate over.

164
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,357
- Uh-oh, no no no, don't
knock the gate over.

165
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,190
No!

166
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,250
Alright, we're leaving it there

167
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,220
and we're just puttin' em all back up,

168
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,680
in case someone else wants
to use the secret fort.

169
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,450
- So we stocked up and
got a year's worth supply

170
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,830
of toothpaste and just
some household products

171
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,180
that we need, so we can
put in our storage room

172
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,220
and Calvin has not had an accident.

173
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,230
We've been gone a lot of the day.

174
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,600
I brought his potty
and he just went potty.

175
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,220
And I'm so proud of him.

176
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,350
He has not gone potty yet.

177
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,260
Where did Jared go?

178
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,093
There you are.

179
00:05:18,093 --> 00:05:19,750
- I was just admiring my
tetrissing of all of our stuff.

180
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,060
- [Ellie] You did amazing.

181
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,480
- That's a year's worth of supplies

182
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,230
we got in the backseat or the trunk

183
00:05:26,747 --> 00:05:29,300
and that's some dad skill right there.

184
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,460
The key to building a fort Jackson,

185
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,790
there's a couple things.

186
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,430
You need to get a good solid foundation,

187
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,510
but you also want to maximize your space,

188
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,862
so finding that balance

189
00:05:38,862 --> 00:05:43,862
is one of the biggest keys
into fort building, right?

190
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,973
- Yeah.

191
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:46,600
- So we need to get blankets,

192
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,038
we need to get pillows, but
we also need to arrange--

193
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:49,960
- I got a pillow.

194
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,000
- Oh good job, you're
already ahead of schedule.

195
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,200
But we also need to find that good balance

196
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,000
to where we can get in and out and around

197
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,720
and have a good club area

198
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,830
and that sort of thing.

199
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,916
Maybe even a flushable toilet.

200
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,300
We'll figure out
somethings that we can do.

201
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,650
But I feel like this is a good place

202
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,780
to start building and
to start our foundation.

203
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,613
- I'm gonna start building.

204
00:06:10,613 --> 00:06:12,037
- You got it.

205
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:15,287
(playful guitar music)

206
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,100
Alright I think we've got the foyer,

207
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,230
grand entrance hall done.

208
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,320
We've got a sloped roof right here.

209
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,153
But that's not it,

210
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:30,980
I've got ideas for expansion.

211
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:31,813
And that's the thing,

212
00:06:31,813 --> 00:06:33,682
you gotta start small, but
then you've got to expand

213
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:35,500
once things are going well.

214
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,980
You can't keep yourself too comfortable.

215
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,660
if you're comfortable, you're not growing.

216
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,600
So we've got this back area right here,

217
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,060
I call it the back 40,

218
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,010
we're gonna try and
get that filled in here

219
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,260
to get some more livable space.

220
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,170
And then once we're done with that--

221
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,650
Oh, you got an idea?

222
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,240
Ooh look at that bungee.

223
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,270
Then, I'm thinking, you always need

224
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,110
a good escape route, okay?

225
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,520
You got your back 40 here.

226
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,952
You got the door workin'?

227
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:58,785
- Uh-huh.

228
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:59,618
- Good job.

229
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:02,070
- [Jared] And then we've got
our escape route right here.

230
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,430
We've gotta get all of that roofed.

231
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,058
You think you can help me with that bud?

232
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:06,031
- Yeah.

233
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:08,650
(playful guitar music)

234
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,650
- [Jared] Okay, look at
that square footage Jackson.

235
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,483
Look at that.

236
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:15,180
That is something to be proud about.

237
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,590
You helped me with this,

238
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,400
Calvin you helped me with this.

239
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,960
Look, it's almost done guys.

240
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,164
Do you like it Calvin?

241
00:07:21,164 --> 00:07:21,997
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,600
- You know, I think we've made
some really big improvements

243
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,730
from the last fort that
we created down here.

244
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,960
We have a lot less materials used,

245
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,060
we have a lot more livable space,

246
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,380
and it's an open concept.

247
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,213
What do you think Jackson?

248
00:07:33,213 --> 00:07:34,190
- It's great.

249
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,950
- Oh good, I'm so glad you like it.

250
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,617
We got our flashlights.

251
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:41,009
- [Ellie] Okay, go get in the fort.

252
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:41,842
- I'm so glad you like it.

253
00:07:41,842 --> 00:07:43,510
Yay Calvin.

254
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,200
What if we order a
pizza and watch a movie?

255
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,713
- [Boy] Yeah!

256
00:07:49,713 --> 00:07:51,790
- That would be so fun.
- I wanna eat Cocoa Puffs.

257
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,623
- You want Cocoa Puffs?

258
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:53,456
- Yeah.

259
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,292
- Okay.

260
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,160
- [Both] Best fort ever!

261
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,540
- Now that we've had the
fort done for awhile,

262
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,490
I think my favorite thing
is seeing Jackson and Calvin

263
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,510
play in the fort together.

264
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,411
- Is Mom allowed this time?

265
00:08:05,411 --> 00:08:07,270
- [Jared] What do you guys
think, should Mom be allowed?

266
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,628
- Whoa.

267
00:08:08,628 --> 00:08:09,461
- Look my thing.

268
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:11,144
- Watch a movie in here?

269
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:11,977
- Bolt.

270
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:12,810
- Bolt?

271
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,745
- And eat pizza.

272
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:17,173
- We don't have pizza.

273
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,097
- We can go get some.

274
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,577
Is Dad gonna go get some?

275
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:20,410
- You bet I am.

276
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:21,243
- Is Dad gonna go get pizza?

277
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:22,100
- You bet I am!

278
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,020
You've been working hard,
gettin' all those things.

279
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,330
Let's show 'em what you've done.

280
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,500
- Okay, ever since Jared
and I have been married,

281
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,890
when we first got married,

282
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:33,450
we tried to save and have
two months of rent ahead,

283
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,309
just as an emergency,

284
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,039
and we've always tried to do that.

285
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,959
And then over the years

286
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,000
we've tried to increase that amount

287
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,450
up to five months, in case we lose a job

288
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,510
or in case something happens,

289
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:45,670
we have an emergency fund.

290
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,670
So we've always tried
to do that financially,

291
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,250
but we also have always tried

292
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,020
to have extras on hand.

293
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,129
With our church, we've always been told

294
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:58,170
emergency preparedness,
always be prepared.

295
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:02,060
And my dad, he had this
steady job for 30 years,

296
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:05,100
his retirement was ahead,
everything was in line

297
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,070
and then a slap in the face,

298
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,890
he got laid off.

299
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,130
And for a full year, my mom and dad lived

300
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,130
off of their storage.

301
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:15,840
They kept a storage for 30 years,

302
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,020
never had to use it,

303
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,850
but they used it just in
the habits of having extras

304
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,180
and they would go through it and use it

305
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,460
and then restock.

306
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,050
But when my dad lost his job,

307
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,670
they spent a year using
all their toilet paper,

308
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,670
their chocolate chips for
chocolate chip cookies,

309
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,770
their flour for bread.

310
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:34,460
They just lived off of it.

311
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,730
And my dad said that's what saved us.

312
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,500
So when we've been in
our small apartments,

313
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,570
I have always tried to have
10 extra cans of beans,

314
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:49,570
or 10 extra cans of stuff
that we know that we use,

315
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,380
and we cycle through and use.

316
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,170
So now that we've been
in our house for a year,

317
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,920
that's something that's
been a goal of ours.

318
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,830
is to stock up and have a year's supply

319
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,510
of everything we need.

320
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,030
And we haven't quite done that yet,

321
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,180
but this year is what I'm trying to do

322
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,870
is get that, every month try
and buy extra cans of food

323
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:12,320
and my biggest goal is to get the kids

324
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,940
and Jared and I, 72-hour kits right here.

325
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,560
So just like boom boom 72 hour kits.

326
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,319
We haven't always had space to do this,

327
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,090
in our last place we
happened to have a garage,

328
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,130
so we had some stuff there,

329
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,043
but in our small apartments
we didn't have room,

330
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:31,970
but we would at least try
and have a few things,

331
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,080
like we'd have one extra hairspray

332
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,230
or five extra cans of food.

333
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:39,670
And we try and always have
some sort of preparedness.

334
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,650
So today I'm really proud of us.

335
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,839
We don't have a ton of food storage wise,

336
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,240
but we do have a year's supply

337
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,900
of paper towels and toilet paper.

338
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:55,600
We have a two year supply
of shampoo and conditioner,

339
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,740
tons of feminine products, Q-tips, soaps,

340
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,090
we got tons of deodorant, some hairsprays

341
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:07,240
and then just the stuff that
we just go through really fast.

342
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,830
We got a lot of baby wipes.

343
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:12,170
We bought one of these a year ago

344
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,830
and it took us a full
year to go through it,

345
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,000
it just has tons and
tons of baby wipes in it.

346
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,060
We bought two of those,

347
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,400
because with the new baby coming,

348
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,210
we'll definitely be going through more.

349
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,230
So I feel really good.

350
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,360
This has been a goal of ours

351
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
that we're trying to go for.

352
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,720
And my next goal is 72 hour kits and food,

353
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,190
like water, that should probably have been

354
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,480
our first thing that we had in here,

355
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:37,180
but we need a few gallons
of water, just in case.

356
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,890
Crap happens, that's why
when we bought the house

357
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,960
Jared got a generator for the electricity

358
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,970
and internet and stuff.

359
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,110
That's one thing that we
bought for preparedness.

360
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,622
That's our goal, that's
what we've been doing.

361
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:52,270
We're slowly but surely getting there.

362
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:53,160
You know, over the years,

363
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,550
we've been married for, I think
this year's our ninth year

364
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,060
or something, we've been
married eight years.

365
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,240
Our whole marriage, that's something

366
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,740
that we've worked towards,
just emergency preparedness

367
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,150
in ever aspect of our life,

368
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,610
So I'm just yay, we're getting there.

369
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,334
And we're building forts and eating pizza!

370
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:10,400
- [Jared] Alright guys, look what I have.

371
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:12,115
- Pizza.

372
00:12:12,115 --> 00:12:13,140
- [Jared] We didn't have Cocoa Puffs,

373
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,430
but we've got pizza with cookies.

374
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,350
Pizza with cookies, just like you wanted.

375
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,760
Hey, this is a special treat.

376
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,310
We're probably never ever ever ever ever

377
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:23,780
gonna do this again, so let's enjoy it

378
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,260
while we can, okay guys?

379
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,440
Should we put on the movie?

380
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,410
Have some pizza?

381
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,820
Call it a good time?

382
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,124
Yeah boy.

383
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,207
(chill guitar music)

384
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,050
Alright the kids are in bed

385
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,490
after our adventure in forts.

386
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,417
We had a fort in the store,

387
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:43,500
we had a fort in the basement

388
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,830
and it was just the best,

389
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,350
it was so much fun.

390
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,720
We are wrapping up our night.

391
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,730
Ellie is watching The Bachelor.

392
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,412
Is it The Bachelor or The Bachelorette?

393
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:52,670
- Bachelor, I'm painting my nails.

394
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:54,650
- [Jared] Oh diggity dang, girl.

395
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,760
You've got some fly nails.

396
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,810
- I've been tweeting all about it

397
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:57,980
and instagramming it.

398
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,956
It's a new color.

399
00:12:58,956 --> 00:12:59,789
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

400
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:00,710
- [Ellie] I tried it from Butter London.

401
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,160
My first time ever using their polish.

402
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,870
- [Jared] They look as smooth as butter.

403
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,180
- And it's called Mum's the Word.

404
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,837
If you want to know.
- Mom's the Word, the color?

405
00:13:07,837 --> 00:13:08,670
- [Ellie] Yeah.

406
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,503
- [Jared] Cool.

407
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,550
- I'm so proud of my nails.

408
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,800
- I am too, I would be,

409
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,919
they look really healthy
and strong, Ellie.

410
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:14,752
- [Ellie] Thank you.

411
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:15,585
- My knee still hurts,

412
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:16,440
if you guys were wondering.

413
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,952
- [Ellie] Oh I'm sorry.

414
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:19,890
- I'm gonna give it a couple days.

415
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,970
If it doesn't get any better,

416
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,510
if I still feel this sharp pain,

417
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm gonna go have it looked at.

418
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,900
Because honestly, I may
have, not completely torn,

419
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,210
but maybe torn it just a little bit.

420
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,930
Anyway, that's gonna be
it from us tonight guys.

421
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,270
Thank you so much for watching the video.

422
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,810
If you enjoyed it, give it a big thumbs up

423
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:36,530
and we will see you tomorrow bye.

424
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,100
I caught you in a yawn this time.

425
00:13:38,100 --> 00:00:00,000
I caught her in a yawn!
