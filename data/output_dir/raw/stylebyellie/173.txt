1
00:00:00,277 --> 00:00:02,860
(lively music)

2
00:00:07,122 --> 00:00:10,205
(underwater bubbles)

3
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:13,436
- Are you gonna fly the
Star Fighter for us Calvin?

4
00:00:13,436 --> 00:00:14,269
- Yeah!

5
00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:15,270
- You're our best pilot.

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,502
We need you to accomplish this mission

7
00:00:16,502 --> 00:00:17,768
without any casualties.

8
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:18,601
Can you do it?

9
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,471
- Yeah.

10
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:21,388
- Alright, let's do it.

11
00:00:22,738 --> 00:00:24,431
Okay we're going into hyperspace.

12
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,563
Whoa!

13
00:00:25,563 --> 00:00:26,396
- [Electronic Voice] Pull up.

14
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:29,327
- [Jared] Pull up, pull up, pull up.

15
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:30,744
Oh no, our pilot.

16
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,837
We crashed.

17
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:34,610
We crashed.

18
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:36,444
I thought you were our best pilot.

19
00:00:36,444 --> 00:00:38,884
Mom, he crashed, our best pilot.

20
00:00:38,884 --> 00:00:40,835
This is so stinking cool.

21
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:43,956
Good morning and welcome
to the Grand Cayman Island.

22
00:00:43,956 --> 00:00:46,377
Today is going to be filled with swimming,

23
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:49,081
snorkeling and sunshine.

24
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,809
Well, sunshine in our hearts,

25
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:52,745
in our hearts.

26
00:00:52,745 --> 00:00:55,328
(lively music)

27
00:01:26,919 --> 00:01:28,779
- Today is more of a quiet day.

28
00:01:28,779 --> 00:01:30,412
We just got back from swimming

29
00:01:30,412 --> 00:01:33,148
and Jared is venturing out into the sea.

30
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:34,717
The kids are getting a bath

31
00:01:34,717 --> 00:01:38,632
and of course, I did
bring some bath bombs.

32
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,066
We are going to have some quiet time,

33
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:43,234
so we're all gonna have a little nap,

34
00:01:43,234 --> 00:01:44,582
and then I think I'm gonna take 'em

35
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:48,525
to the gift shop today and
pick out something special.

36
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:51,709
We have brought the ocean into the boat.

37
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:54,292
Look at this blue purple water.

38
00:01:55,838 --> 00:01:58,092
It looks just like the ocean.

39
00:01:58,092 --> 00:01:58,925
Is that your bath bomb?

40
00:01:58,925 --> 00:01:59,758
- Yeah.

41
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:03,312
(lively music)

42
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:14,854
- I have just landed on
the Grand Cayman Island

43
00:02:14,854 --> 00:02:17,152
and I'm doing a port adventure today.

44
00:02:17,152 --> 00:02:18,088
I am snorkeling

45
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:20,500
and I've never done
proper snorkeling before,

46
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,811
so I hope it's really really great.

47
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:25,978
I hope we get to see some
really great sea life today.

48
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:29,594
(lively music)

49
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:45,888
They don't have Dr. Pepper on the boat.

50
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,113
- We just got done with play time

51
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:49,969
and of course, we had to grab a snack,

52
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,536
which his a little carrot cake.

53
00:02:51,536 --> 00:02:53,424
We just walked around the shop here

54
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,673
and just said okay, I want that,

55
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:56,181
and they give it to you, and you walk off

56
00:02:56,181 --> 00:02:57,784
and eat it, it's awesome.

57
00:02:57,784 --> 00:03:00,048
The food service here is so cool.

58
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:01,056
Ewww.

59
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,456
And we are now standing in line

60
00:03:02,456 --> 00:03:04,623
and who are we gonna meet?

61
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:06,836
- Sofia.

62
00:03:06,836 --> 00:03:07,831
- Sofia.

63
00:03:07,831 --> 00:03:10,627
We're gonna meet a few fun characters,

64
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,627
while we eat our snack.

65
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,277
(atmospheric music)

66
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:17,444
(underwater bubbling)

67
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:11,691
(atmospheric music)

68
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:42,177
- Stitch downstairs.

69
00:04:42,177 --> 00:04:44,096
- You saw Stitch downstairs?

70
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:45,368
- Yes I did.

71
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,709
- Oh my goodness, did you
give Stitch a big hug?

72
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:48,709
- And I saw,

73
00:04:50,869 --> 00:04:52,202
I saw Sofia too.

74
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,350
- That's amazing, give me a big hug.

75
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,816
(Ellie laughs)

76
00:04:57,816 --> 00:05:01,208
- [Ellie] Okay, you tell me, how was it,

77
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,532
on a scale of one to 10.

78
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,206
- It was a 10 for sure.

79
00:05:04,206 --> 00:05:05,383
(Ellie yells)

80
00:05:05,383 --> 00:05:08,423
Get this, you want to know something?

81
00:05:08,423 --> 00:05:09,256
- Yeah.

82
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:10,217
- I think I saw a shark.

83
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:11,508
- [Ellie] No way.

84
00:05:11,508 --> 00:05:12,341
- Yeah.

85
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,174
- I was kinda scared, yeah.
- Were you scared?

86
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:15,226
- [Ellie] How big?

87
00:05:15,226 --> 00:05:16,059
- Probably like that.

88
00:05:16,059 --> 00:05:18,067
- Oh my gosh, oh my gosh!

89
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:20,059
- I'm pretty sure I
caught it on the GoPro.

90
00:05:20,059 --> 00:05:22,679
- [Jackson] Dad, was the shark this big?

91
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:24,827
- Yeah, it was probably about as long

92
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:26,349
as you and I are long tall.

93
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:27,312
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

94
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:28,145
- Dad, why did you see a shark.

95
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,377
Why did you see a shark?

96
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:30,657
- Because I was snorkeling.

97
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:31,996
- Jared, I cannot wait to see the footage.

98
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:35,020
The boys and I had a wonderful time.

99
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,860
We went to the play time, we got a snack,

100
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,269
we met some fun people.

101
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:41,132
I think it's been really fun

102
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,564
to talk with other people on the ship

103
00:05:43,564 --> 00:05:46,312
and know where everyone's from,

104
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,811
and this is a lot of
peoples' 10th, 11th cruise,

105
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,705
they come every year,

106
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:52,784
they've made it their family tradition

107
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:55,103
or their family trip to go every year.

108
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:56,475
It's just been fun.

109
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:57,528
I'm starving.

110
00:05:57,528 --> 00:05:58,611
I'm a starvin' Marvin.

111
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,522
- Okay, can you hold that thought,

112
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,369
because I have something for the boys.

113
00:06:01,369 --> 00:06:02,648
- [Ellie] What?

114
00:06:02,648 --> 00:06:05,752
- Jackson and Calvin, I
got something for you.

115
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:08,631
Okay while I was snorkeling,

116
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,744
I got something for you boys.

117
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,044
Are you ready to see?

118
00:06:11,044 --> 00:06:12,711
One for you, Calvin,

119
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,713
and one for Jackson.

120
00:06:14,713 --> 00:06:15,679
- What is it?

121
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,512
- I'll show you.

122
00:06:16,512 --> 00:06:18,762
Calvin, this one's for you.

123
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:21,964
It's a little turtle.

124
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,221
That one's for you.

125
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,641
- [Ellie] Say thanks.

126
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,474
- It's a turtle.

127
00:06:26,474 --> 00:06:29,929
- And then this one Jackson is for you.

128
00:06:29,929 --> 00:06:30,774
- Turtle.

129
00:06:30,774 --> 00:06:32,357
- Yeah.

130
00:06:32,357 --> 00:06:33,190
Is that cool?

131
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,070
- I'm gonna put this
in my rock collection.

132
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,903
- That's a great idea.

133
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,068
Yeah.

134
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:40,901
Is that cool?

135
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,560
- Thank you, that's awesome.

136
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,727
(tropical beat music)

137
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,579
We're in Jamaica.

138
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:58,580
- Wah gwine muh yuh.

139
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,335
- We're in Jamaica.

140
00:07:00,335 --> 00:07:03,231
Breakfast today with the family.

141
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:07,328
We are having a sit down
breakfast this morning,

142
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:08,536
of course with chocolate milk,

143
00:07:08,536 --> 00:07:10,955
unlimited amounts of chocolate milk.

144
00:07:10,955 --> 00:07:12,979
And look at this view.

145
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:15,478
This is our view, we are in Jamaica.

146
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:17,487
We are gonna go out there soon.

147
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,987
(lively steel drum music)

148
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,824
- [Jared] Jackson, we
made it to the beach.

149
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:40,262
- [Jackson] Is that the ocean?

150
00:07:40,262 --> 00:07:42,326
- [Jared] That is, are you
excited to go swimming in it?

151
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:43,159
- Yeah.

152
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,992
- [Jared] Yeah?

153
00:07:43,992 --> 00:07:45,422
That's a good sport (laughs).

154
00:07:45,422 --> 00:07:47,308
That is not where we're
going, don't worry.

155
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:48,926
- [Jackson] Did we bring goggles?

156
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,926
- [Jared] Oh yes, we
definitely brought goggles.

157
00:08:00,193 --> 00:08:03,141
- This is the Red Stripe Beach in Jamaica.

158
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:05,166
It is a private beach.

159
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,693
Not very many people are here at all.

160
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:10,397
This was like one of the excursions that

161
00:08:10,397 --> 00:08:11,655
- A different cruise line.

162
00:08:11,655 --> 00:08:12,488
- [Ellie] Yeah.

163
00:08:12,488 --> 00:08:14,088
- Disney didn't go here,

164
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:15,848
probably because it's really small, but

165
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:17,896
- [Ellie] It's amazing.

166
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:19,341
There's not many people.

167
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,765
The food is like five star.

168
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:22,297
The sand
- It's like brown sugar.

169
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:26,326
- This is probably the best
beach, this and Florida.

170
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:27,159
I've been to a few beaches,

171
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,991
and those are my favorite.

172
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:30,770
And here we are.

173
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,210
Jared's gonna run out with Jackson,

174
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,866
'cause he's a daredevil.

175
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:37,616
(bright tropical beat music)

176
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:08,688
- [Jared] Get set, go!

177
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:13,312
(laughing)

178
00:09:19,437 --> 00:09:20,270
- Look at this rock.

179
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,353
- Oh my gosh.

180
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:23,835
It's beautiful.

181
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:27,892
Alright Jackson and I have our loot.

182
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,860
You want to show them?

183
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,259
- Look at all the seashells.

184
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:34,694
- [Ellie] This is everything
that Jackson and I just found.

185
00:09:34,694 --> 00:09:38,468
Jackson one, that's the
best looking seashell.

186
00:09:38,468 --> 00:09:40,301
Where did you find it?

187
00:09:41,685 --> 00:09:43,885
Just right over there?

188
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,085
Honey.

189
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,445
- Did somebody say jerk chicken?

190
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:48,428
You know that's right.

191
00:09:48,428 --> 00:09:50,253
Jerk chicken.

192
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:52,630
My brother Matt lived in
Jamaica for two years,

193
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,289
so he said, Jared, the one thing

194
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:55,793
that you have to do
while you're in Jamaica

195
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:57,441
is get some jerk chicken.

196
00:09:57,441 --> 00:09:58,425
And you know that's right.

197
00:09:58,425 --> 00:10:00,017
You know that's what I did.

198
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,545
Jackson, come try some jerk chicken.

199
00:10:01,545 --> 00:10:02,822
You want some leg?

200
00:10:02,822 --> 00:10:05,022
Mmm, that's some good jerk chicken.

201
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:06,939
- It's good, I like it.

202
00:10:09,424 --> 00:10:12,273
- [Jared] Whoa, say yum yum in my tum tum.

203
00:10:12,273 --> 00:10:14,128
- Yum yum in my tum tum.

204
00:10:14,128 --> 00:10:15,175
- [Jared] Yeah.

205
00:10:15,175 --> 00:10:17,696
Calvin say yum yum in my tum tum.

206
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:18,529
- Tum tum.

207
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:20,584
- You know what he always says

208
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:22,515
whenever he meets a character,

209
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:24,402
talk, talk more.

210
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:25,235
- [Jared] Yeah.

211
00:10:25,235 --> 00:10:26,425
- He's surprised that they don't talk.

212
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,166
- [Jared] I know, it's so funny.

213
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:31,333
You want the guys to talk, huh Calvin.

214
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:39,614
- One two three.

215
00:10:39,614 --> 00:10:41,781
(howling)

216
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:45,221
- [Jared] Jackson, what are you drawing?

217
00:10:45,221 --> 00:10:46,216
- O.

218
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,383
- [Jared] O, show me an O.

219
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:51,710
That's an O, good job.

220
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,441
What letter is this?

221
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:54,988
- S.

222
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:55,821
- [Jared] S, that's right.

223
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,855
What letter is that.

224
00:10:57,855 --> 00:10:58,751
- M.

225
00:10:58,751 --> 00:10:59,893
- [Jared] That's right,
what letter is that?

226
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,104
- W!

227
00:11:01,104 --> 00:11:03,305
- [Jared] That's right.

228
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,193
(howling)

229
00:11:04,193 --> 00:11:06,208
(Jared laughing)

230
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,745
What does this say?

231
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:08,945
- Jackson.

232
00:11:08,945 --> 00:11:11,654
- [Jared] That's right.

233
00:11:11,654 --> 00:11:13,600
(laughing)

234
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,561
- He is so good.

235
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:17,292
- You want to see big mama grow?

236
00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:20,042
(Jared laughing)

237
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,773
- He's only doing that

238
00:11:21,773 --> 00:11:24,676
because she is requesting that.

239
00:11:24,676 --> 00:11:26,533
Every night it's been the same.

240
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:27,837
He has to cut her food

241
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,420
and feed it to her.

242
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:33,709
- Who doesn't love a little
late night room service,

243
00:11:33,709 --> 00:11:34,581
I sure do.

244
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,132
The boys are watching

245
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:37,985
- Stitch.

246
00:11:37,985 --> 00:11:40,409
- [Ellie] Stitch,
because we met him today.

247
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,242
- Yeah.

248
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,417
- So we are watching Stitch

249
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,639
and I ordered some room service.

250
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,718
I ordered one cookie, they gave me three,

251
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:48,468
so thumbs up for him.

252
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:50,872
And cheese pizza.

253
00:11:50,872 --> 00:11:53,453
- I ordered three cookies.

254
00:11:53,453 --> 00:11:54,727
- [Ellie] You did?

255
00:11:54,727 --> 00:11:55,901
I think I did.

256
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:57,011
- No I did.

257
00:11:57,011 --> 00:11:58,200
(Ellie laughs)

258
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,514
- [Ellie] Hey, hey did
you just drop your sucker

259
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,282
to eat the cookie?

260
00:12:03,282 --> 00:00:00,000
Aww Calvin.
