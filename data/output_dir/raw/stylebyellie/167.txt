1
00:00:00,216 --> 00:00:03,299
(happy upbeat music)

2
00:00:13,202 --> 00:00:14,990
- Alright, the kids are not feeling

3
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:15,823
all that well.

4
00:00:15,823 --> 00:00:18,092
They're getting over a
little cough that they have

5
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:20,797
and so Jackson is having
a sick day from school.

6
00:00:20,797 --> 00:00:23,014
So I thought it would be fun

7
00:00:23,014 --> 00:00:25,770
to do something extra
special for breakfast.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,103
So I'm gonna make breakfast.

9
00:00:29,022 --> 00:00:31,092
Just watch, you'll see.

10
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:34,175
(upbeat happy music)

11
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,961
I have breakfast for each of you.

12
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,612
Here you go, Cal.

13
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,815
- Are we gonna eat them in our tummy?

14
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:04,815
- [Mom] Yup.

15
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:08,229
- Oh, they're not real!

16
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:09,069
- [Mom] But this is for you.

17
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:09,902
I made it.

18
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:12,812
- This is not real.

19
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:16,493
- [Mom] Well, at least drink the milk.

20
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,905
- It's not real!

21
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:18,939
- [Mom] There's no milk in there?

22
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:20,439
I poured the milk!

23
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,389
Here Calvin.

24
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:24,472
Will you eat?

25
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,418
- [Jackson] This is not real.

26
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:29,887
- [Mom] Oh, do you need real food?

27
00:01:29,887 --> 00:01:32,140
You don't wanna eat what I made you?

28
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,835
- No, this is not real.

29
00:01:33,835 --> 00:01:34,784
- Okay.

30
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:37,265
Well, let me tell you something.

31
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:40,851
I have something very special
for you for breakfast.

32
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,432
So, if you don't like this,

33
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:46,079
maybe you'll like what
else I have planned okay?

34
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,162
(happy upbeat music)

35
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:53,883
- This is my dad's first flight.

36
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:56,216
He wants to get a picture with the pilot.

37
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:57,319
Is that possible?

38
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,662
Do you wanna get a picture with the pilot?

39
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,767
(laughter)

40
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:01,600
He's so embarrassed.

41
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,537
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:02,537 --> 00:02:03,536
- We don't need to do that.

43
00:02:03,536 --> 00:02:04,369
- [Flight Attendant] Yeah, go ahead.

44
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:05,202
- Go ahead, Dad!

45
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:06,035
Good how are you guys?

46
00:02:06,035 --> 00:02:07,512
- [Pilot] Good!
- [Flight Attendant] Hi!

47
00:02:07,512 --> 00:02:08,723
- Hi, how are you?

48
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:10,037
- You one of our Delta pilots here?

49
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,232
- No, he wants to meet you guys.

50
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,898
(laughter)

51
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:16,283
- Okay, Jackson, Calvin it's ready!

52
00:02:16,283 --> 00:02:17,681
I'm down here, okay?

53
00:02:17,681 --> 00:02:19,318
I made the kids a better breakfast

54
00:02:19,318 --> 00:02:20,615
that I think they'll like.

55
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,257
The first one obviously was a flop.

56
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,430
I knew they probably would be like,

57
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,822
"What? This is weird?"

58
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,002
I thought it was funny.

59
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:28,434
But I made them breakfast in here.

60
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:29,818
And we'll see what they think.

61
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,561
So they can eat breakfast
in their own kitchen.

62
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:33,394
Come here!

63
00:02:33,394 --> 00:02:34,761
Where's Calvin?

64
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:35,594
- Is it real?

65
00:02:35,594 --> 00:02:36,605
Or the toy one?

66
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:37,499
- [Mom] Is it the toy one?

67
00:02:37,499 --> 00:02:38,332
I don't know.

68
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,294
Let's wait for Calvin, okay?

69
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:40,127
- What?

70
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,443
I want syrup.

71
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,134
- [Mom] Do you like it?

72
00:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,776
Is this okay to eat in your
own kitchen this morning?

73
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,529
- Yeah, I wanted syrup.

74
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:54,362
- [Mom] Okay.

75
00:02:54,362 --> 00:02:55,683
What did I make you?

76
00:02:55,683 --> 00:02:56,681
- Pancakes!

77
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:57,661
- [Mom] What kind?

78
00:02:57,661 --> 00:02:58,911
- Mickey Mouse.

79
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,005
- [Mom] Did you have those on the ship?

80
00:03:02,005 --> 00:03:03,194
- [Jackson] Yeah.

81
00:03:03,194 --> 00:03:06,260
- These are cough drop suckers,

82
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,834
I guess for kids.

83
00:03:07,834 --> 00:03:09,245
And as you can hear,

84
00:03:09,245 --> 00:03:10,860
mama needs some too.

85
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,723
Do you want me to cut it for ya?

86
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:13,801
- [Boys] No.

87
00:03:13,801 --> 00:03:14,634
- No?

88
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:15,641
- I want to.

89
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:16,474
- Okay.

90
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:21,612
(happy light music)

91
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:23,098
- Well, we made it to Los Angeles.

92
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:26,639
And Dad said, "I'll try
not to embarrass you."

93
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,659
I said, "Okay good.

94
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,027
Because my goal is to
embarrass you as much as I can"

95
00:03:30,027 --> 00:03:30,998
- And you did!

96
00:03:30,998 --> 00:03:31,916
- And would you say I've succeeded?

97
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,472
- I'd say you have succeeded.

98
00:03:33,472 --> 00:03:34,348
- Okay, good.

99
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,206
Mission accomplished.

100
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,039
Hey Jarvey.

101
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,872
- Hey!

102
00:03:36,872 --> 00:03:37,705
(laughs)

103
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:38,538
- Come here, Calvin.

104
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:39,641
Do you wanna play with it?

105
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:42,450
So this one's Calvin's
because there's only four.

106
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,784
But this one has more pieces.

107
00:03:43,784 --> 00:03:44,691
That one's yours.

108
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:45,724
Do you wanna take it out?

109
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,807
And build it?

110
00:03:49,085 --> 00:03:50,118
Good job.

111
00:03:50,118 --> 00:03:51,598
Hey Jer.

112
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:52,898
Good, how are you?

113
00:03:52,898 --> 00:03:56,495
While Dad I gone doing a little
bit of business right now,

114
00:03:56,495 --> 00:03:59,273
we are kind of having a low key day

115
00:03:59,273 --> 00:04:01,508
where I broke out some puzzles.

116
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,841
Jackson really like puzzles.

117
00:04:04,683 --> 00:04:06,245
And you do.

118
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,601
He usually plays with an
airplane one at preschool

119
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,198
but I broke the puzzles out.

120
00:04:10,198 --> 00:04:11,852
And I thought Calvin would like this one

121
00:04:11,852 --> 00:04:14,825
a little but more than,
more than he's doing.

122
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:15,658
But he's watching.

123
00:04:15,658 --> 00:04:16,523
(laughs)

124
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:18,697
What do you think, Mr. Cal?

125
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,531
- It goes right here.

126
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,190
- [Mom] Yeah, good job.

127
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,044
- I did it!

128
00:04:23,044 --> 00:04:25,053
- This morning has been just,

129
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:25,976
one of those mornings.

130
00:04:25,976 --> 00:04:27,950
And when you say, "just
one of those mornings"

131
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,601
most people know that it's just been

132
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:32,106
one of those mornings

133
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,669
where it usually is just like so-so.

134
00:04:34,669 --> 00:04:36,634
Not that well.

135
00:04:36,634 --> 00:04:38,340
Kind of along that route.

136
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,703
The kids have just been really whiny.

137
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:43,784
Just because they're just
getting over their coughs.

138
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,289
They're really tired

139
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,569
and I've been in the kitchen cooking.

140
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:50,122
Jackson was kinda whiny and

141
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,947
he was kinda done with puzzles

142
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,456
and wanting to watch a show

143
00:04:53,456 --> 00:04:54,832
but we've watched lots
of shows this morning

144
00:04:54,832 --> 00:04:56,281
and I was like, I'm not
letting you watch TV

145
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:58,727
you're just gonna have
to just not watch shows.

146
00:04:58,727 --> 00:04:59,584
We're done.

147
00:04:59,584 --> 00:05:01,706
And he's like, "let me
just lay on your bed!"

148
00:05:01,706 --> 00:05:02,927
And I'm like, okay

149
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,056
and I went and looked on him

150
00:05:04,056 --> 00:05:06,223
and he put himself to bed.

151
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:10,545
So cute.

152
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,064
And I feel bad that he was so,

153
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,084
we're not gonna go in there.

154
00:05:16,084 --> 00:05:17,213
I just felt kinda bad.

155
00:05:17,213 --> 00:05:18,748
They're just kind of,

156
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:21,210
you know that stage where
you're getting over a cold

157
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,284
and you're just kinda grumpy

158
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:24,101
and your nose has been
stuffy for a few days

159
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:26,196
and you're just done with it?

160
00:05:26,196 --> 00:05:27,429
I think that's where the kids are at.

161
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:28,262
- Oh look!

162
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,171
You dropped your name tag, Dad.

163
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,847
We'll just put that chip
right on your shoulder.

164
00:05:32,847 --> 00:05:33,996
(laughter)

165
00:05:33,996 --> 00:05:36,034
We are at VidSummit today.

166
00:05:36,034 --> 00:05:37,980
My dad and I flew out
today to go to VidSummit.

167
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,129
VidSummit, if you didn't know,

168
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:42,309
is all about creators learning
more about what they do.

169
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:45,054
Specifically, the business
side of everything.

170
00:05:45,054 --> 00:05:47,215
Oh that light is so bright and blue.

171
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:48,121
So I'm excited.

172
00:05:48,121 --> 00:05:49,962
I think it's very important to

173
00:05:49,962 --> 00:05:51,295
learn more about

174
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,413
anything you can.

175
00:05:53,413 --> 00:05:54,936
And especially when it's in your field.

176
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:58,599
So the next couple days
is going to be filled

177
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:02,498
with some people who are
very inspiring and motivated.

178
00:06:02,498 --> 00:06:03,911
And just even tonight,

179
00:06:03,911 --> 00:06:05,461
we've had so much fun.

180
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:07,224
Learning and talking with people.

181
00:06:07,224 --> 00:06:09,704
And one of the best parts
about all of this is

182
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:11,115
seeing your buddies.

183
00:06:11,115 --> 00:06:14,032
- (in unison) Hey!

184
00:06:14,894 --> 00:06:16,865
- I just got into our hotel room

185
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:20,532
but I don't think my
dad knows I'm here yet.

186
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:26,588
Boo.

187
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:29,241
(laughter)

188
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:30,744
How did you not hear me?

189
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:31,911
- I got--

190
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:33,267
(laughs)

191
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:36,044
I came into the room
and I was like, "howdy!"

192
00:06:36,044 --> 00:06:37,763
And I was sitting here and I vlogged

193
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,108
and I was like, I just
walked into the hotel room

194
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,646
but I don't think my
dad knows I'm here yet.

195
00:06:41,646 --> 00:06:42,993
(laughter)

196
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:43,902
Did I scare you?

197
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:44,735
- No, not at all!

198
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,568
- Oh please!

199
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:46,627
- No, no, no!
- You jumped.

200
00:06:46,627 --> 00:06:48,043
You went pale.

201
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:48,876
- Nope.

202
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:49,709
(laughter)

203
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,346
- We are all up from naps.

204
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:55,178
And I feel like sometimes
I need to give my kids

205
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:56,807
a little better

206
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,688
like, understanding

207
00:06:58,688 --> 00:07:00,164
cause sometimes when I
don't get enough sleep

208
00:07:00,164 --> 00:07:01,447
I get cranky, you know?

209
00:07:01,447 --> 00:07:02,880
And I think that that's part of it.

210
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,852
But we're all up from naps.

211
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:05,995
We gonna put your shoe on?

212
00:07:05,995 --> 00:07:07,449
Jackson, did you have a good rest?

213
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,628
- [Jackson] Yeah.

214
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,461
- Yeah?

215
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,652
Did you dream about anything.

216
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:11,778
- [Jackson] I didn't.

217
00:07:11,778 --> 00:07:12,611
- You didn't?

218
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:15,466
Okay, let's go play with Penny, okay?

219
00:07:15,466 --> 00:07:16,917
You guys wanna give her a carrot?

220
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:20,172
I made a chicken pot pie for lunch.

221
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:21,689
And dinner ha!

222
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,964
Because that's what we're
gonna eat for like two days.

223
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:25,647
And I have left over carrots.

224
00:07:25,647 --> 00:07:27,340
Here, Cal, do you wanna
give Penny a carrot?

225
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,722
You gotta give it to
her or she'll take it.

226
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:30,555
Here you go, Pen.

227
00:07:30,555 --> 00:07:31,691
Soft.

228
00:07:31,691 --> 00:07:32,643
Good girl!

229
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,971
(laughs)

230
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:35,904
You want another one?

231
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,560
Let's see if Calvin will
let you give it her.

232
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,545
He doesn't seem...

233
00:07:39,545 --> 00:07:40,378
- Penny!

234
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:42,596
Come here, girl.

235
00:07:45,446 --> 00:07:46,869
- Come hold this for me.

236
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:50,119
(happy acoustic music)

237
00:07:55,978 --> 00:07:57,006
I'm trying to show Jackson

238
00:07:57,006 --> 00:07:58,127
and he doesn't see very excited about this

239
00:07:58,127 --> 00:07:59,541
but I think he'll like it once I show him.

240
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,662
You take the leaf,

241
00:08:01,662 --> 00:08:03,912
you put it under the paper,

242
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,856
and you put the paper on top.

243
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:07,689
And look.

244
00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:09,168
He has a bug in his hand.

245
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:11,470
You take the crayon,

246
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:14,346
and you color over the leaf.

247
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:16,691
These are kinda like your stencils.

248
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:17,524
- Can I do it?

249
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,261
- Isn't that cool?

250
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:20,094
Can you see that leaf?

251
00:08:20,094 --> 00:08:20,939
Right there?

252
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:21,772
(Calvin crying)

253
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:22,750
You wanna try one?

254
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,679
- No.

255
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:24,551
- Do you wanna try it?

256
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,384
- No.

257
00:08:25,384 --> 00:08:26,552
- No?

258
00:08:26,552 --> 00:08:29,259
Ugh, well today's kind of a bust.

259
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,372
You just wanna play
with bugs and eat them?

260
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:32,205
- No!

261
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:33,038
(laughs)

262
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:34,250
- That was fun for me.

263
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,083
Come here!

264
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,210
Come tell me.

265
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:39,417
Jackson's finding bugs in his jar.

266
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,081
And he's like Mom, I found this bug.

267
00:08:41,081 --> 00:08:42,576
(gasps) Penny!

268
00:08:42,576 --> 00:08:44,398
Mom, Penny ate my bug!

269
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,015
(laughter)

270
00:08:47,015 --> 00:08:48,410
What happened?

271
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,617
- Penny ate my bug.

272
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:50,700
- Penny Girl.

273
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,064
Aw, I'm sorry.

274
00:08:54,035 --> 00:08:57,326
Why does that make me laugh so hard?

275
00:08:57,326 --> 00:08:59,166
(laughter)

276
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh.

277
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,511
- Everyone, desserts

278
00:09:01,511 --> 00:09:02,910
assemble!

279
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,743
- Ah!

280
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,756
- Whoa, Choco Tacos!

281
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:06,921
- Yes we did.

282
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:07,783
We hit up the gift shop

283
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:09,021
and we got desserts.

284
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:10,984
Choco Tacos remind me of my childhood.

285
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,312
Have you ever had one before?

286
00:09:12,312 --> 00:09:13,145
- Yes!

287
00:09:13,145 --> 00:09:14,112
- They're like the freaking best.

288
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:15,610
It's just like this perfect mixture of

289
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,726
cholcolatey goodness and vanilla ice cream

290
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:20,246
and waffle something or another.

291
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:21,705
- This is what we do when
we don't have our kids.

292
00:09:21,705 --> 00:09:22,538
- Yeah!

293
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:23,411
- We hang out and eat ice cream

294
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:26,326
- In a hotel!
- In hotel rooms.

295
00:09:26,326 --> 00:09:27,159
- Whoa!

296
00:09:28,631 --> 00:09:31,295
That was quite a jump.

297
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:32,404
Okay, let's go to bed.

298
00:09:32,404 --> 00:09:34,604
We can not find Jackson's bike today.

299
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:36,009
Huh?

300
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,676
Where was your bike?

301
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:39,687
- Somewhere.

302
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:40,607
- Somewhere.

303
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,882
We don't know where his bike is.

304
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,094
And the Batmobile.

305
00:09:44,094 --> 00:09:46,085
We've had the Batmobile for like,

306
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,918
a year and

307
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:49,471
where you take it out to charge it

308
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:50,928
was jammed.

309
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:53,604
Like it got backed up into something.

310
00:09:53,604 --> 00:09:56,280
And I cannot get it open
to charge the battery.

311
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,318
That is the best toy we have.

312
00:09:58,318 --> 00:10:00,430
Like, the Batmobile.

313
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:03,069
We might have to get another one sometime.

314
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:03,902
- Yeah.

315
00:10:03,902 --> 00:10:04,735
- Cause that's really fun.

316
00:10:04,735 --> 00:10:05,568
Yeah.

317
00:10:08,305 --> 00:10:10,796
- And I get a Batman-ville.

318
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:11,925
- A Batman-ville?

319
00:10:11,925 --> 00:10:12,758
- Yeah.

320
00:10:12,758 --> 00:10:13,591
- Yeah.

321
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:14,795
Maybe we'll get a different one this time.

322
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:17,212
Maybe we'll get like a truck.

323
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:20,499
- I think it's one of those.

324
00:10:20,499 --> 00:10:21,332
- Yeah.

325
00:10:21,332 --> 00:10:22,165
- For Christmas.

326
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:23,578
- Yeah.

327
00:10:23,578 --> 00:10:25,825
Okay, put your arm together.

328
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,149
Say goodnight to our friends.

329
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:28,219
- Goodnight.

330
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,419
- Say goodnight, daddy.

331
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:30,663
- Goodnight, daddy.

332
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,038
- So, Carl made the obvious observation

333
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:36,089
that Brian and are matching shirts.

334
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:37,577
- We are wearing the same shirt, huh?

335
00:10:37,577 --> 00:10:39,317
- So we were laying on the bed.

336
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,597
I think you posted it on
Twitter or something like that,

337
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,002
Carl posted on Twitter like,

338
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:44,283
Oh sleepover!

339
00:10:44,283 --> 00:10:45,116
We're all in the bed.

340
00:10:45,116 --> 00:10:46,212
It was funny so.

341
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,768
It's like almost midnight.

342
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,376
We've got an early morning tomorrow so

343
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:50,862
I'm gonna call it a night so

344
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:51,807
goodnight to you.

345
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:52,640
- Night, man!

346
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,473
- Goodnight to you.

347
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:54,306
- Good seeing you, buddy.

348
00:10:54,306 --> 00:00:00,000
- And goodnight to you.
