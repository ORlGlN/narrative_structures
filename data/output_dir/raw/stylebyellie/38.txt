1
00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:02,080
- I gave Calvin a choice.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:03,788
- I'm planning a trip right now.

3
00:00:03,788 --> 00:00:05,270
- Now I want you to be honest with me.

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,490
We have never used this before.

5
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,670
Good morning guys.

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,290
Well, I'm gonna be honest with ya,

7
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,350
it's not morning anymore.

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,580
It's well past the morning.

9
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,110
Hi Mom.

10
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,047
Guys, my family is not
feeling all that great.

11
00:00:17,047 --> 00:00:18,690
- We almost made it too.

12
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,530
- Yes, we almost did.

13
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,450
Well here's the thing,

14
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,410
I still feel great and girl,

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,676
I look good too.

16
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:30,550
- No one's had colds, no one's
had flu's all winter long.

17
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:32,956
See ya.

18
00:00:32,956 --> 00:00:34,048
- And then last night,

19
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:37,270
Jackson woke up and he just
did not sound good at all.

20
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,960
That was about four in the morning

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,390
and he slept with us
the rest of the night.

22
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,800
Poor guy was just wheezing,
it was just terrible

23
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,970
and then Calvin this morning,

24
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:47,930
was not near as bad,

25
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:49,190
but it's starting to be,

26
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,450
I feel like it's coming on

27
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,320
and of course we're out
in the middle of the day,

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,180
where we're up,

29
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,820
we're doing things, and so it's not as bad

30
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,653
as it was at night,

31
00:00:57,653 --> 00:01:00,110
but I feel like the nighttime's
gonna get pretty bad.

32
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,590
So that means, we've kinda
just been hunkering down.

33
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,440
We have been down here in the basement

34
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,860
and we've watched a couple movies

35
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,370
cuddling on the couch as a family

36
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,180
just trying to get these
kids to feel better.

37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,162
They've gotten some energy now.

38
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:10,995
- [Child] Dad!

39
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:11,960
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

40
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,584
Hey, who was that?

41
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,970
- It's me making cookies.
- Me.

42
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,410
- Can you hear Jackson's voice?

43
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,610
Can I have some cookies?

44
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,831
- [Jackson] Yeah.

45
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:22,020
- Yeah Dad.

46
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,379
- [Jared] Hi.

47
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:24,212
- Cookies.

48
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:26,525
- Thank you, thank you
for making me cookies.

49
00:01:26,525 --> 00:01:27,640
(gobbling)

50
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,178
It's a secret family
recipe, I can't tell you.

51
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:31,750
(gobbling)

52
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,930
So today's going to be one of those days

53
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,350
where we just hang out,

54
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,440
(yelling)

55
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,080
make cookies in the hello room

56
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,650
and try and remedy the situation.

57
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,860
- So usually once a
week I try and sit down

58
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,960
and work on our upcoming week

59
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,550
and our schedule,

60
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,650
my bullet journaling,

61
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,650
and I want to update you guys

62
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,570
how that's been going.

63
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,150
The first few weeks, this
is how the layout was,

64
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,800
the week across, the notes down below,

65
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,550
but I'm kinda changing
it up to look like this

66
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,930
and this, so I'm really trying to work

67
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,380
on my cursive right now.

68
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,630
I'm getting our weeks down and scheduled.

69
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,463
I went--

70
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:07,460
Penny, hey.

71
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,949
Jackson's been teasing Penny.

72
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:10,089
I don't want her thinking

73
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,600
she can grab your toy.

74
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
And you're kind of giving it to her okay?

75
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,530
Do not give her your toy, okay?

76
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,103
- But she's trying to get it

77
00:02:17,103 --> 00:02:18,270
if I don't let her.

78
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,600
- Okay let's try not to
tease her with it, okay?

79
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,620
Penny, where's your toy?

80
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,453
Let's get your ball.

81
00:02:22,453 --> 00:02:23,480
Come here Pen.

82
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,570
This is yours.

83
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,840
That is yours, okay.

84
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:30,660
(Ellie laughs)

85
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,493
Okay, are we good?

86
00:02:31,493 --> 00:02:33,270
Do we have our own toys?

87
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:36,980
I want to schedule a little family trip

88
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,870
before the baby comes.

89
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,380
I have some few things on my calendar

90
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,790
that involves me and work and some fun

91
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,623
that I get to do,

92
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:47,050
but I want to take the
whole family, the kids

93
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,330
and including my Miss Penny,

94
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,860
Miss Pretty Penny, I want us
all to go on a little trip.

95
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,470
And Jared and I have talked lots

96
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,840
about maybe we could,
'cause I love the beach

97
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,500
and I love that the kids find seashells

98
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,100
that's just something that's so fun to me.

99
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,090
But we can't go too terribly far

100
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,330
and we really want to use our camper.

101
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,950
We want to use our camper,

102
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,240
so I'm planning a trip right now

103
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,180
and I don't know what days we're going

104
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,013
or when we're going,

105
00:03:12,013 --> 00:03:13,970
so I'm just trying to really schedule out

106
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,210
pretty far in advance.

107
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,540
This is into March.

108
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,560
And just see what works for us

109
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,760
and what scheduling works for us.

110
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,593
Where did they?

111
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,600
Okay, I'm everywhere,

112
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,740
because I'm watching the kids and Penny.

113
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,587
Penny girl, Penny.

114
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:28,930
(laughs)

115
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,150
But I'm just excited.

116
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,320
I think that it's gonna be really fun

117
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,660
to be able to bring Penny
on a little trip with us.

118
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,910
I just think it sounds really fun

119
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,970
to do a little family getaway
with our Miss Pretty Penny.

120
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,520
- I feel like I've made a breakthrough

121
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,680
with this whole potty training stuff.

122
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,110
Calvin has been wearing
his potty training watch

123
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,160
and so far today,

124
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,520
he's gone to the bathroom
on every half hour

125
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,110
for the first, I don't
know, half of the day

126
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,610
and then every hour the
second half of the day so far.

127
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,640
And every time his watch has gone off,

128
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,890
he's gone to the bathroom

129
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,130
and it hasn't been a fight.

130
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,530
And I think the reason behind it is,

131
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,230
well I'm just an awesome dad.

132
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,490
That's reason number one.

133
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,030
No really, what I think it is,

134
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,670
is when I take Calvin to the potty,

135
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,320
what I first would do is I would have him

136
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,210
get up on the potty.

137
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,160
I would take his undies off

138
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,800
and then I would sit him on the potty,

139
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,750
I would do that.

140
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,579
But, like I mentioned, I
didn't take my own advice.

141
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,369
I gave Calvin a choice

142
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,860
and this is what the choices were.

143
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,010
I kinda am tricking him into his choices.

144
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,843
- I like that.

145
00:04:24,843 --> 00:04:26,370
- I would say like--
(laughing)

146
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,002
- I like tricking my kids.

147
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:29,070
- That's kind of the parent's thing.

148
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,890
I say, do you want to take your undies off

149
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,920
or do you want me to take them off?

150
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,820
And he says, no I want to do it.

151
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,970
So then he does it.

152
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:37,803
- And he'll climb up.

153
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:40,130
- Yeah, do you want me
to lift you on the toilet

154
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,250
or do you want to get on the toilet?

155
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,890
No, I want to get on the toilet.

156
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,870
Okay and then he sits down on the toilet

157
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,118
and then he goes pee.

158
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:47,951
- Oh yay.

159
00:04:47,951 --> 00:04:50,110
- We haven't had any
accidents today so far

160
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,530
and it's been great.
- He's doing good.

161
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,780
- It's been so good

162
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,820
and I feel like I am finally
getting the hang of this.

163
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,653
because honestly--

164
00:04:56,653 --> 00:04:57,486
- I'm proud of you, it helps.

165
00:04:57,486 --> 00:04:59,340
- With Jackson, you did it.

166
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,080
I mean I didn't really do the
potty training, Ellie did.

167
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,030
And so I feel like I'm
actually contributing

168
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:06,240
to this whole family situation.

169
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,900
- Thank you, thank you.
- Oh well you're welcome.

170
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,770
- It is helpful,

171
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,870
because I have been, I was
laid down half the morning.

172
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,730
- I feel about as good as I look,

173
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,676
which is subpar.

174
00:05:15,676 --> 00:05:17,926
(laughing)

175
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,790
Well Ellie hasn't been feeling that great.

176
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,650
You know Jackson is kinda
like Groggy McGroggerson.

177
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,340
- But he seems happy as a clam right now.

178
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,099
- [Jared- Yeah, when our energy levels--

179
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:27,932
- He's so happy.

180
00:05:27,932 --> 00:05:29,235
- [Jared] Are high.

181
00:05:29,235 --> 00:05:30,937
- [Ellie] He likes to,
you little booty dancer.

182
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:32,125
(Jackson laughs)

183
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:34,280
- Oh did you hear that,
kind of like uuuuhhh.

184
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,113
Anyway,
- yeah.

185
00:05:35,113 --> 00:05:36,580
- But yeah, I thought
I'd give you some info

186
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,790
on my potty training breakthrough,

187
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,743
so the book will come out next week.

188
00:05:40,743 --> 00:05:42,990
(bright music)

189
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,940
- [Ellie] Let me help you do your name.

190
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,820
- The probe feature when set correctly

191
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,850
will signal an alert when
the internal food temperature

192
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,070
reaches the desired
set target temperature!

193
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,470
We have never used this before

194
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,330
in our oven.

195
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,570
We have a probe feature.

196
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,600
We're probing our food.

197
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,433
(laughs)

198
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,950
Gosh dangit, I'm the worst.

199
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,260
I am making Chicken Cordon Bleu for dinner

200
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:12,110
slash lunch slash linner, second lunch,

201
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,237
first dinner tonight.

202
00:06:13,237 --> 00:06:15,701
And the thing about
chicken is it dries out

203
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:18,180
so dang fast, especially when you bake it.

204
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,140
And so Ellie was like, I was like,

205
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,950
should I go get an internal temperature,

206
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,910
an instant temperature reader?

207
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:25,060
She's like, Jared we
have a probe downstairs

208
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,560
that we've just never used before,

209
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,520
so I'm reading all the
instructions on how to do this.

210
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,310
It's cool enough that I
can see when it happens,

211
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,170
but when it gives me an
alert that it happens,

212
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:35,420
oh man that's just
technology at its finest,

213
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,830
the less I have to do, oh my gosh,

214
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,010
my technology senses are tingling.

215
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,070
Are you ready for this?

216
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,070
Piping hot 165 degrees
exactly, Chicken Cordon Bleu.

217
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,700
This is the first time
I've ever made this,

218
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,170
so I hope it is as delicious as it looks.

219
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:54,560
When I was in college, we had
the cafeteria freshman year

220
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,170
and they had Chicken Cordon Bleu there.

221
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:58,390
And it was just like
cafeteria Chicken Cordon Bleu,

222
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,420
but I loved it,

223
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,270
and they had it almost every single Sunday

224
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,240
and it was the best.

225
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,770
Everyone chowed down on the Cordon Bleu.

226
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:06,110
So I'm hoping this is like that.

227
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:07,910
Okay family, come up to the dinner table.

228
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,630
It is time to eat Daddy's
delectable delights.

229
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,110
Now I want you to be honest with me.

230
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,100
This was the first time I've
ever made Chicken Cordon Bleu.

231
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,933
How was it?

232
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:15,890
- It was--

233
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,756
- [Jared] Headache inducing?

234
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:17,589
- very good.

235
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,137
No (laughs).

236
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:20,145
It was very good.

237
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:20,978
- [Jared] Good.

238
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:21,811
- I really liked it.

239
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,840
I haven't eaten chicken in a long time.

240
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,673
- [Jared] Yeah.

241
00:07:24,673 --> 00:07:25,510
- But it was very good.

242
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,560
- It was pretty good.

243
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
It wasn't like what I remember

244
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,800
as a freshman.

245
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,470
That stuff was like holy crap.

246
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,080
I don't know if it was
because I'm a freshman?

247
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,913
- Sometimes it's the--

248
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:35,290
it's like you were
starving college student.

249
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,136
- [Jared] Well yeah, I was a
poor starving college student.

250
00:07:37,136 --> 00:07:38,444
- It did taste so good.

251
00:07:38,444 --> 00:07:39,277
- [Jared] Yeah.

252
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:40,302
- The tuna sandwiches?

253
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,147
That's how we feel.
- Oh my gosh.

254
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:42,460
- Whoa.
- ahh.

255
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,700
- Poor college students,

256
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,320
nothing tasted better
than a tuna sandwich.

257
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,690
- I want a tuna fish sandwich right now.

258
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,030
Oh my gosh, that is a comfort food for me.

259
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,720
Tuna fish sandwiches
with potato chips, oh.

260
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,770
- With pickles in it,

261
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,780
you eat it.
- Yeah totally.

262
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,680
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

263
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,360
and Miracle Whip, Ellie.

264
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,246
None of that mayonnaise, Miracle Whip.

265
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,700
Are you guys Miracle
Whip or mayonnaise fans?

266
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,180
Let me know in the comments down below.

267
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,480
Jackson did you make your bed today?

268
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,060
Good job.

269
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,240
That's actually not bad at all.

270
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,300
I'm proud of you buddy,

271
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,600
thank you for doing that.

272
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,810
That's so sweet of you.
- No!

273
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,834
So it is time for us to get ready for bed

274
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,310
and we can read a story.
- Jo, this is Jo.

275
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,350
- Is that the Joker?

276
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,920
Should we read Batman and
the Joker story tonight?

277
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,700
I don't know, Batman and the Joker.

278
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,940
I think we'll read that story tonight.

279
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,620
It's been kind of a day to just recoup,

280
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,020
relax and try to get over this sickness,

281
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,647
so I think we're going to
call it a night Jackson.

282
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,890
- Dad remember we watch Lego Batman?

283
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:41,169
- Yeah, and now we're reading the Batman.

284
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,129
Yeah, oh careful, don't fall backwards,

285
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,420
that was close.

286
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,730
I had a dad save today at the table.

287
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,130
Calvin was falling off our barstool

288
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,610
and he fell off backwards

289
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,300
and I reached and grabbed
him and saved him.

290
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,270
It was pretty epic.

291
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,230
Hey guys, can you say
goodbye to our friends

292
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,339
and that we'll see them tomorrow?

293
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,205
- Goodbye Daddy friend.

294
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:01,038
(Jared laughs)

295
00:09:01,038 --> 00:09:01,955
- Bye poop.

296
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:04,610
- Bye, we'll see you tomorrow.

297
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,780
Thank you guys for watching.

298
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,480
I hope you have a wonderful week.

299
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,740
And I think if I'm right this upload's

300
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,230
Happy Valentine's Day.

301
00:09:11,230 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll see you guys later, bye.
