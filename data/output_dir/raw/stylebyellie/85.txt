1
00:00:00,188 --> 00:00:01,918
- Holidays certainly
are not stopping guys.

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,727
The holidays are not stopping right here.

3
00:00:03,727 --> 00:00:06,269
- Nothing has been like this pregnancy.

4
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:07,102
You turd.

5
00:00:07,102 --> 00:00:08,197
You didn't need to do that.

6
00:00:08,197 --> 00:00:09,110
- [Man] That's awesome.

7
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,571
Don't you know if you want to run fast,

8
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:12,032
you've gotta keep those calories up.

9
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,826
You gotta keep eating that
food if you wanna run fast.

10
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:17,071
(laughing)

11
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:18,872
- It's the day after Christmas.

12
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:20,361
It still feels like Christmas

13
00:00:20,361 --> 00:00:23,458
because we are doing the same thing.

14
00:00:23,458 --> 00:00:24,507
We're playing.

15
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:27,374
The kids have their hot cocoa.

16
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:29,869
Is that too hot or is it good Cal?

17
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:30,981
- It's hot cocoa.

18
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:32,281
- [Woman] It's hot cocoa.

19
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:35,032
And I think our mugs are so cute.

20
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,645
Okay, are you okay with the whipped cream?

21
00:00:37,645 --> 00:00:39,150
Calvin just about went ballistic

22
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:41,279
when I put whipped cream on his.

23
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,091
(laughing)

24
00:00:43,091 --> 00:00:44,332
- Welcome to the day after Christmas

25
00:00:44,332 --> 00:00:45,508
where it still feels like Christmas

26
00:00:45,508 --> 00:00:47,110
because the action is still happening.

27
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,080
We've got kids playing all over the place.

28
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,848
Ellie, tell me what you're
working on right now.

29
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:53,641
- I'm working on my hand lettering.

30
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:55,772
- Ellie is giving herself
like a really hard time

31
00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:57,067
with her hand lettering.

32
00:00:57,067 --> 00:01:00,053
She's doing like this creative cursive.

33
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:01,152
- It just takes practice.

34
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:02,617
- [Man] Well that's the thing,
is it does take practice

35
00:01:02,617 --> 00:01:04,144
and I don't want you to
get hard on yourself.

36
00:01:04,144 --> 00:01:06,144
- It actually looks really good.

37
00:01:06,144 --> 00:01:09,474
These are really cute, but it just,

38
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:12,292
like you could see how inconsistent I am

39
00:01:12,292 --> 00:01:13,267
and that's what's frustrating.

40
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:14,455
- Oh yeah, it can be frustrating,

41
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:16,088
but you can't let yourself get down

42
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:17,625
because it's gonna take a lot of practice.

43
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,302
This is something new to you.

44
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:21,088
Anyway, so we've got some fun activities

45
00:01:21,088 --> 00:01:22,388
planned for the day.

46
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:25,845
Ellie's parents called us
yesterday or texted us yesterday,

47
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:26,916
I can't remember which one,

48
00:01:26,916 --> 00:01:28,385
and they said, hey wanna come up and see

49
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:30,161
what the kids got for Christmas

50
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:32,502
and we're bringing our swimming suits.

51
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:34,566
That only means one of two things.

52
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:36,078
Either we're running
through the sprinklers today

53
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:37,894
or we're getting in the hot tub

54
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,677
and the sprinklers
aren't working my friend.

55
00:01:39,677 --> 00:01:41,245
So I think we're getting in the hot tub.

56
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:42,816
So I have to run to the hot tub store

57
00:01:42,816 --> 00:01:44,317
to get some extra stuff.

58
00:01:44,317 --> 00:01:45,942
It's been awhile since
we've been in the hot tub

59
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:47,365
so I have to get some things for it

60
00:01:47,365 --> 00:01:48,613
to make sure it's all fine and dandy

61
00:01:48,613 --> 00:01:52,309
for the in laws, 'cause I
can't disappoint the in laws.

62
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:53,230
Am I right?

63
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,164
Am I right?

64
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,411
While I'm at the hot tub
store they have a machine

65
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:57,878
that tells you everything you need to do

66
00:01:57,878 --> 00:02:00,480
to your water with the
watering sampling machine.

67
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,075
So I'm gonna grab a little water sample.

68
00:02:02,075 --> 00:02:03,326
They're gonna run it through their program

69
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:04,510
and tell me exactly what I need to do

70
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,009
to make sure it's all good.

71
00:02:06,009 --> 00:02:06,842
Normally I've been doing a really good job

72
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,374
of keeping the hot tub at a good level,

73
00:02:09,374 --> 00:02:11,058
but since it has been awhile,

74
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:13,592
I just wanna double check
and get exact details

75
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,892
of what I need to do.

76
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:16,225
Okay, dip it in.

77
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,628
Oh yes, oh good, water sample.

78
00:02:19,628 --> 00:02:21,494
Perfect water sample.

79
00:02:21,494 --> 00:02:22,411
Seal it up.

80
00:02:25,636 --> 00:02:26,469
Got it.

81
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,024
Perfect specimen of water.

82
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:29,406
Holidays certainly aren't stopping guys.

83
00:02:29,406 --> 00:02:31,401
The holidays are not stopping right here

84
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,410
because my secret Santa gift came Ellie.

85
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,307
Are you ready for this?

86
00:02:35,307 --> 00:02:37,361
- I'm very happy (mumbles).

87
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:38,530
- My secret Santa gift came.

88
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,535
Boom, Psych episodes.

89
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,563
All the Halloween episodes on one disc.

90
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:44,480
Also, boom.

91
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:50,054
Da, da, da, da.

92
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,147
A Psych T-shirt.

93
00:02:51,147 --> 00:02:52,868
This is a shirt that I'm
actually gonna wear a lot.

94
00:02:52,868 --> 00:02:53,773
I really, really like it.

95
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:55,971
So thank you Redditgifts
for making this possible

96
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:56,974
by doing the secret Santa.

97
00:02:56,974 --> 00:03:00,703
Ellie, we participated the
world largest secret Santa

98
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:02,449
three years in a row.

99
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,298
- You have.
- And you have.

100
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:06,492
- I started last year.
- That's true, that's true.

101
00:03:06,492 --> 00:03:09,638
- It's been fun (mumbles).
- It has been fun.

102
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:11,389
- It's fun because it's
a complete stranger

103
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:12,910
getting you a gift and it's like

104
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,715
they have no idea who you are

105
00:03:14,715 --> 00:03:15,961
and it just makes it fun.

106
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:17,767
We have fun getting our guys gifts.

107
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,773
It was hard.
- We really, really did.

108
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:21,712
- Their descriptions, both of ours,

109
00:03:21,712 --> 00:03:23,611
they love to do pot.

110
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:25,620
Both of our descriptions of the guys.

111
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,720
So I'm like--

112
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,918
- What do you get someone
who likes to smoke pot?

113
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:30,078
We came up with something.

114
00:03:30,078 --> 00:03:31,320
- We came up with a good gift,

115
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,713
but it was hard 'cause it's like

116
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,984
there's people all over
the world that do this,

117
00:03:34,984 --> 00:03:38,706
so everyone's interests
can be completely opposite

118
00:03:38,706 --> 00:03:39,957
of what yours are.

119
00:03:39,957 --> 00:03:42,145
- Mine was also a musician, so I got them

120
00:03:42,145 --> 00:03:45,188
a really cool capo that
my dad found out about

121
00:03:45,188 --> 00:03:47,616
that lets you change the capo inserts

122
00:03:47,616 --> 00:03:49,942
that fits different kinds of guitars

123
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,057
or even different types of capo tunings.

124
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:55,702
Like on Christmas we play an A capo,

125
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,395
so it's cut so it only
blocks out three strings

126
00:03:58,395 --> 00:04:00,277
instead of all six, so you can play

127
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:01,386
like you're playing an A chord

128
00:04:01,386 --> 00:04:03,132
and it just allows you
to play different things.

129
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:05,638
Anyway, that's not where it ends.

130
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:08,812
Kesha and June, one of our
IVF couples from Hawaii

131
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:11,036
sent us a little gift package
and thank you for that.

132
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:12,187
That is so sweet of you.

133
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:15,687
Filled with T-shirts and goodies and look.

134
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,148
- [Ellie] They've been so cute.

135
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:18,981
- Look at that.

136
00:04:18,981 --> 00:04:19,814
Isn't that cool?

137
00:04:19,814 --> 00:04:22,949
- You wear the shirts
from Hawaii that they send

138
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:24,927
all the time 'cause they're nice.

139
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:26,561
- Yes, that's exactly
what I was gonna say.

140
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,317
It's like I wear those Hawaii shirts

141
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:29,535
all the stinking time.

142
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:31,385
- [Ellie] You guys, thanks.

143
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,668
- Oh, look at these Hawaiian treats too.

144
00:04:34,668 --> 00:04:35,501
Thank you.

145
00:04:35,501 --> 00:04:38,113
- Oh, that's so cute.
- Wow.

146
00:04:38,113 --> 00:04:39,405
Does it say Hawaii on the back?

147
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,268
- You turds, you didn't need to do that.

148
00:04:41,268 --> 00:04:43,299
- That's awesome.
- That was so cute.

149
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:47,246
- Kesha and June, you take us to the moon.

150
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,998
Get it, 'cause it rhythms?

151
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,342
Thank you guys.
- That was so sweet.

152
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,215
- [Man] That is very sweet.

153
00:04:52,215 --> 00:04:55,620
- Our kids are gonna love these.

154
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,497
- [Man] Aw, present patrol, so cool.

155
00:04:58,497 --> 00:04:59,357
- Thank you.

156
00:04:59,357 --> 00:05:01,827
- We read a letter from them
and it was very, very sweet.

157
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:03,244
And I am so glad.

158
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,573
Oh, my gosh.

159
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,981
That's so cool.

160
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:08,702
We're gonna have to come visit
these guys you know that.

161
00:05:08,702 --> 00:05:09,650
You already have.

162
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,702
I need to do this.

163
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:12,407
Maybe I'll take a trip
to Hawaii by myself.

164
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:13,257
(ding)

165
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:15,380
- [Ellie] I'm never gonna hold that down.

166
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,798
- I love our IVF couples
and our new IVF couples

167
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:22,965
because of their hope,
their perseverance and hope.

168
00:05:24,243 --> 00:05:26,043
- They sent a sweet, sweet letter to us.

169
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:27,887
- Yes, they did.

170
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:29,912
So thank you guys for
being a part of our life.

171
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,430
- Alright guys, it's a good thing

172
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,750
that we have a lot of
pens around this house.

173
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,167
I went through one full pen in last night

174
00:05:39,575 --> 00:05:40,648
and this morning.

175
00:05:40,648 --> 00:05:42,956
I think I've been sitting here for hours

176
00:05:42,956 --> 00:05:46,696
going over hand lettering and it's funny

177
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:50,863
'cause Jennifer, she got
the same book for Christmas

178
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:54,471
for hand lettering and
so we've been texting

179
00:05:54,471 --> 00:05:56,506
back and forth like our pictures.

180
00:05:56,506 --> 00:05:58,766
You can get on Amazon, Hand Lettering 101.

181
00:05:58,766 --> 00:05:59,849
So I'm done.

182
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:02,997
These are some of mine
that I've been working on

183
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:05,354
and she sent me a picture of her birthday,

184
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:07,419
which hers was so stinking cute.

185
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:10,902
And so I tried it and it's funny how

186
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:14,485
bad it looks, but then
when you fill it in,

187
00:06:15,624 --> 00:06:18,008
fill it, I was saying feel.

188
00:06:18,008 --> 00:06:20,485
Sometimes when I talk, I think of comments

189
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,127
and then I have to resay something

190
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:23,779
so I know it sounds right.

191
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,271
When you fill it in,

192
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:28,372
when you fill it in,

193
00:06:28,372 --> 00:06:30,215
it looks so much better.

194
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,024
Like I'm impressed with that.

195
00:06:32,024 --> 00:06:33,363
I think that looks beautiful.

196
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:35,333
But when I first wrote it, it wasn't.

197
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,326
But when you kind of make
it look a little fancy

198
00:06:37,326 --> 00:06:39,848
and pretty it's so nice.

199
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:41,077
So I've been having a lot of fun with it.

200
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:43,895
The boys are downstairs
playing a video game

201
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:47,728
and I'm sitting here
eating chips and salsa.

202
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:49,110
I didn't tell you guys yesterday,

203
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,065
but on Christmas it hit
me, for like two hours

204
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:55,588
it wasn't too terrible, I came out of it,

205
00:06:55,588 --> 00:06:59,910
but like being pregnant
I get headaches a lot

206
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:02,121
and like hormonally I get headaches a lot,

207
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:06,421
but nothing, nothing has
been like this pregnancy.

208
00:07:06,421 --> 00:07:08,720
Like I have a headache
right now, but it's not bad,

209
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,553
it's just a headache.

210
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:12,688
But yesterday it was like my
eyes couldn't see the light,

211
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:14,808
like I was nauseous, I had to lay down,

212
00:07:14,808 --> 00:07:17,461
put the covers over my
head, like shut the blinds.

213
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:18,544
It was crazy.

214
00:07:19,771 --> 00:07:22,422
So my chiropractor, you know,

215
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:23,900
it's been like Christmas break or whatnot,

216
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,663
so I wanna call today
and get an appointment,

217
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:30,260
but holy cow, it's crazy, it's intense.

218
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,894
But I've been having fun doing this.

219
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:35,965
I love just that I've been
sitting here all day doing this.

220
00:07:35,965 --> 00:07:37,971
Cute, I get to keep practicing.

221
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:39,471
This book has like it's like hey

222
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:43,106
now that you did all of
these, let's start again.

223
00:07:43,106 --> 00:07:45,159
So it's like you do it
again, and again, and again

224
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,483
until you get the lettering right.

225
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:48,566
How was that?

226
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:50,568
You like it?

227
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,553
(yelling)

228
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:03,102
Mmm, that good?

229
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:08,364
(laughing)

230
00:08:09,764 --> 00:08:11,262
- [Man] That's Calvin's favorite spot

231
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:12,729
this Christmas holiday.

232
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:13,614
- [Ellie] That's enough.

233
00:08:13,614 --> 00:08:16,042
Are you getting one for everyone?

234
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:16,875
Okay.

235
00:08:19,965 --> 00:08:22,882
Go give one to grandma and grandpa.

236
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,645
It didn't work out.

237
00:08:25,645 --> 00:08:26,878
You have to go to (mumbles).

238
00:08:26,878 --> 00:08:28,932
- [Woman] That's a good gift.

239
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:30,389
- Mom and dad are over here.

240
00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:32,231
Hey, you kids.
- Get down boys.

241
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:34,924
- One more piece and get down.

242
00:08:34,924 --> 00:08:37,587
Seeing all the presents that the kids got.

243
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:40,153
And we're trying to contain these kids.

244
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:43,337
- Come in and know me better man.

245
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,889
Enjoy the feast that
has been provided for us

246
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:47,327
by Bonnie and Joel.

247
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,977
Thank you for bringing dinner tonight.

248
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:53,054
Is it funny that whenever
you guys come over

249
00:08:53,054 --> 00:08:56,468
it's like, oh yeah, we're
just bringing dinner.

250
00:08:56,468 --> 00:08:59,517
- No 'cause when you,
oh that's really close.

251
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,924
- He won't let us in the door if we don't.

252
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:02,272
- When you come for lunch,

253
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:03,842
we expect you to bring lunch.

254
00:09:03,842 --> 00:09:04,757
- We usually bring lunch, yeah,

255
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:07,884
so it's kinda like same,
same, trade, trade.

256
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,014
We've got everyone over here

257
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:11,111
and we are eating some (mumbles)

258
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:12,538
which is a delicious Indian food.

259
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:14,136
- Take one more bite.

260
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:14,969
Thank you.

261
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:16,076
- [Man] Oh yum, that looks great.

262
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,728
Excuse me Mr. Flash.

263
00:09:17,728 --> 00:09:19,386
Don't you know if you want to run fast

264
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:20,931
you've gotta keep those calories up.

265
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:24,193
You gotta keep eating that
food if you wanna run fast.

266
00:09:24,193 --> 00:09:26,193
Yeah, that's right, yum.

267
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:29,051
Now go run fast.

268
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:29,963
- I can't.

269
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:32,214
- Oh, you have to eat more, huh?

270
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:33,786
(growling)

271
00:09:33,786 --> 00:09:37,670
- All of the kids are playing,
but the two worse ones,

272
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,121
Calvin and Lincoln.

273
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,346
What are you doing?

274
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:41,763
- We're climbing.

275
00:09:42,984 --> 00:09:45,251
- You're climbing my bed.

276
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,834
You naughty babies.

277
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:50,560
What are you doing?

278
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,618
I'm glad to see you playing and smiling

279
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:56,035
and not fighting.

280
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:58,219
You crazies.

281
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:00,719
- My slippers.
- Your slippers.

282
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,513
Did they come off?

283
00:10:03,513 --> 00:10:04,430
Put 'em on.

284
00:10:07,187 --> 00:10:08,099
Lost my slippers.

285
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,592
- Yesterday and today I spent the time

286
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:14,797
shoveling off the patio and
a pathway to the hot tub

287
00:10:14,797 --> 00:10:17,713
and part of the patio up here

288
00:10:17,713 --> 00:10:19,325
because we're gonna start a fire.

289
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,806
We got some firewood, we
got some kindling and stuff

290
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:23,830
that we're making to start a fire

291
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,936
and then we're gonna get in the hot tub.

292
00:10:25,936 --> 00:10:27,916
Sounds pretty nice, pretty fun.

293
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:28,919
Penny loves the wood.

294
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,752
Okay, there you go.

295
00:10:29,752 --> 00:10:31,764
You just chew on that
piece for a little bit.

296
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,957
Don't get any splinters.

297
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,040
I'm freezing.

298
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:40,877
That goal here is one match, okay.

299
00:10:41,856 --> 00:10:43,458
And that's what I'm gonna try and do.

300
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,844
We got it set up and I think we can do it,

301
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,687
light it with one match.

302
00:10:47,687 --> 00:10:49,989
Let's give it a go shall we.

303
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:50,822
You got one?

304
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,442
- [Man] Yeah my butt your face.

305
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:56,442
(slow upbeat music)

306
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:08,272
- [Man] I call that successful.

307
00:11:08,272 --> 00:11:09,954
One match ladies and gentlemen.

308
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:12,954
(slow upbeat music)

309
00:11:14,858 --> 00:11:16,289
Whoa, get the camera out of there.

310
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:17,122
It's getting hot.

311
00:11:17,122 --> 00:11:19,341
Fire is a blazing.

312
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:21,198
Steam is a brewing.

313
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:22,492
Hey guys.

314
00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:23,629
Oh geeze.

315
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:25,604
Careful, there's shoes here.

316
00:11:25,604 --> 00:11:29,268
- Joel's steal toed (mumbles) down there.

317
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:30,458
- [Man] Hot tub party.

318
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,405
- Hi, are you gonna get in?

319
00:11:31,405 --> 00:11:32,238
- Yeah, I'm gonna get in.

320
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:33,521
I just thought if I'm gonna film this,

321
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:36,235
I'm gonna be dressed and warm before I--

322
00:11:36,235 --> 00:11:38,078
- Sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

323
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,968
- Thanks for the fire.
- You're welcome, it's fun.

324
00:11:40,968 --> 00:11:42,051
This is cool.

325
00:11:43,195 --> 00:11:44,713
Yeah, I can lift that up.

326
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,401
I'll just do a little more work

327
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:48,166
while you guys are enjoying
yourselves in the hot tub.

328
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,441
No big deal.

329
00:11:49,441 --> 00:11:52,092
- Can you bring out some
licorice and some pop?

330
00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:53,268
- I have Dr. Pepper.

331
00:11:53,268 --> 00:11:55,566
Are you guys okay with that?

332
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:57,979
- Just up and over.
- Just up and over yeah.

333
00:11:57,979 --> 00:11:58,979
That is fun.

334
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,249
Oh, I love this.

335
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:03,195
I love this about the hot tub

336
00:12:03,195 --> 00:12:04,572
and the fire pit and everything.

337
00:12:04,572 --> 00:12:06,916
We've got the hot tub just right

338
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,795
so Ellie can get in it too.

339
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,335
And we're gonna go enjoy ourselves.

340
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:11,431
It's gonna be a fun night guys.

341
00:12:11,431 --> 00:12:13,765
- Oh my gosh, look.

342
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,932
I just touched it so much.

343
00:12:16,963 --> 00:12:18,297
So then when I look in the camera

344
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:20,497
it's just one big red dot.

345
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:21,601
- You're making it angry.

346
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:22,494
- It is angry.

347
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,786
My mom's like you should
put a hot pad on that.

348
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,792
Bye guys.

349
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:29,402
- Thank you for the party.
- It's good to see you.

350
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:31,632
I did want to show you guys--

351
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:32,465
- I'm just going (mumbles).

352
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,588
- Okay, I did want to show you guys.

353
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:38,517
Sometimes when Calvin and
Lincoln gets together,

354
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:39,786
they just fight.

355
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:41,651
- [Woman] Sometimes they always fight.

356
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:43,311
- They always fight.

357
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,284
At their ages they don't wanna share.

358
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,075
Tonight was the cutest thing.

359
00:12:47,075 --> 00:12:48,451
Calvin and Lincoln was playing in our room

360
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:50,427
and then I caught them in my bathroom.

361
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,760
I'm gonna show you what they were doing.

362
00:12:55,715 --> 00:12:59,034
The boys, they wanted to sleep again

363
00:12:59,034 --> 00:13:00,994
in their sleeping bags on our floor

364
00:13:00,994 --> 00:13:02,101
so I let 'em.

365
00:13:02,101 --> 00:13:04,214
But Lincoln and Calvin were in here.

366
00:13:04,214 --> 00:13:05,315
Our swimming suits are on
the ground 'cause we just

367
00:13:05,315 --> 00:13:07,044
got out of the hot tub,
but can you guys see

368
00:13:07,044 --> 00:13:10,171
all of the Christmas ornaments in here?

369
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:13,517
They were in here forever
playing and laughing.

370
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:15,628
They were just like
playing together today.

371
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,099
Good job boys.

372
00:13:17,099 --> 00:00:00,000
(slow upbeat music)
