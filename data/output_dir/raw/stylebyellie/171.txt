00:00:00,369 --> 00:00:03,786
- (bright uptempo music)

2
00:00:09,773 --> 00:00:11,118
- [Driver] Hello everyone.

3
00:00:11,118 --> 00:00:14,996
Welcome to our beautiful
island, Castaway Key.

4
00:00:14,996 --> 00:00:16,184
In a few minutes,

5
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,935
we will be arriving in
our final destination.

6
00:00:39,048 --> 00:00:40,736
- Jackson, do you know where we are?

7
00:00:40,736 --> 00:00:41,590
- At the ocean.

8
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,550
- We're at the ocean.

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,341
We're at Castaway Key,

10
00:00:44,341 --> 00:00:47,037
the last stop before we go home.

11
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,718
What do you think we
should do first today?

12
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:50,551
- Go swimming.

13
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:51,774
- Let's go swimming.

14
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:53,988
- With my goggles on.

15
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:55,038
- Let's do that.

16
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:57,262
Did you find a seashell already?

17
00:00:57,262 --> 00:00:59,398
We haven't even been here 10 minutes.

18
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:00,358
- This is for me?

19
00:01:00,358 --> 00:01:01,659
- Yeah.

20
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,909
(bright uptempo music)

21
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,619
- I'm gonna try and push up underwater.

22
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:14,452
- Let's do it.

23
00:01:14,452 --> 00:01:15,313
- Yeah.

24
00:01:15,313 --> 00:01:18,396
(underwater bubbles)

25
00:01:26,696 --> 00:01:27,529
- [Ellie] Hello.

26
00:01:27,529 --> 00:01:28,667
- Hello.

27
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:32,155
Hey Jackson, put your goggles on.

28
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:32,988
- Hello.

29
00:01:32,988 --> 00:01:34,738
- One two three, woo!

30
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:37,896
(laughing)

31
00:01:39,806 --> 00:01:42,389
(bright music)

32
00:02:13,563 --> 00:02:15,563
(yells)

33
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,397
- Castaway Key was amazing

34
00:02:31,397 --> 00:02:33,494
and I think that the kids had a blast.

35
00:02:33,494 --> 00:02:35,390
And that is what I want.

36
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,429
I want the kids to have a lot of fun

37
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:38,262
and they have.

38
00:02:38,262 --> 00:02:41,269
But you can't leave a vacation
without some souvenirs.

39
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:45,314
And the other day I picked
up a handful of these mugs.

40
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:48,646
I thought they looked very
cute and sweet and classic.

41
00:02:48,646 --> 00:02:51,250
My parents, I believe
I have the story right,

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,779
on their anniversary, they
had gone to Disneyland,

43
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:56,507
or sometime they had gone to Disneyland

44
00:02:56,507 --> 00:03:00,282
and they bought 20 of these Disney mugs,

45
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:02,162
and I didn't ever appreciate them,

46
00:03:02,162 --> 00:03:04,018
but now that I look back,

47
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,594
they are so classic

48
00:03:05,594 --> 00:03:07,125
and I'll try and have a picture posted,

49
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:07,958
(bell dings)

50
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:08,926
because they are beautiful.

51
00:03:08,926 --> 00:03:11,145
But I grabbed a handful of these mugs,

52
00:03:11,145 --> 00:03:13,877
so we have some mugs
to drink hot chocolate

53
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:15,324
in the fall.

54
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,621
It's October 1st soon,

55
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:17,733
and when you guys see this,

56
00:03:17,733 --> 00:03:19,008
it'll be past October 1st,

57
00:03:19,008 --> 00:03:20,208
I can't believe it.

58
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,449
And we got the boys some shirts.

59
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:23,674
Jared saw the Nemo shirts,

60
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:26,446
and we had to get the
boys matching shirts,

61
00:03:26,446 --> 00:03:28,438
and then that's Calvin's.

62
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,023
- [Jared] Go show Mom.

63
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,208
Okay, go show her.

64
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:32,041
- Mom!

65
00:03:34,426 --> 00:03:36,972
- What did she make you?

66
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:39,157
- A heart magic wand.

67
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,243
- A heart magic wand.

68
00:03:41,243 --> 00:03:42,985
You got to meet her?

69
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:43,818
- Yeah.

70
00:03:43,818 --> 00:03:45,113
- Was that cooL?

71
00:03:45,113 --> 00:03:46,742
- I made if for you.

72
00:03:46,742 --> 00:03:49,307
- Oh my heart, thank you.

73
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:51,045
Are we gonna watch Mickey Mouse

74
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:53,444
do a dance party soon?

75
00:03:53,444 --> 00:03:54,497
- Yes.

76
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:55,378
Where's Calvin?

77
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:58,378
- He's right here.
- He's right here.

78
00:04:00,396 --> 00:04:01,646
- [Jared] Awww.

79
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,148
- I do hate that they're separate.

80
00:04:04,148 --> 00:04:06,332
So it's fun when they see each other.

81
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:09,493
Look, Jackson gave that to me.

82
00:04:09,493 --> 00:04:11,320
Tinkerbelle helped you, huh?

83
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,153
- Yeah.

84
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:13,606
- Wow.

85
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:16,773
(bright upbeat music)

86
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:20,664
(signal tone)

87
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:22,758
- Hi guys future Jared
coming in here real quick

88
00:04:22,758 --> 00:04:25,158
just to tell you a little
bit about this time lapse.

89
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,198
If you notice in the
freeze frame right now,

90
00:04:27,198 --> 00:04:29,918
you'll see all of the
cast members on the dock

91
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:31,687
are actually bowing.

92
00:04:31,687 --> 00:04:33,319
And this was such a cool moment.

93
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,574
Whenever we would leave a port,

94
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,125
a good amount of people
would be on the outside

95
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,189
of the ship, watching as we leave.

96
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:41,559
But on this particular
day at Castaway Key,

97
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:44,967
nearly everyone was on
the outside of the ship,

98
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:47,150
watching us depart from the port.

99
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:49,453
And it was very very cool to
see all of those cast members

100
00:04:49,453 --> 00:04:52,832
down there, waving to
us with Mickey hands.

101
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,304
And then they bowed.

102
00:04:54,304 --> 00:04:56,160
And it was this cool moment,

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,372
and everyone on the ship
cheered that could see them.

104
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,141
And it was the coolest thing,

105
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,408
and I wish I wasn't doing a time lapse,

106
00:05:04,408 --> 00:05:06,063
I wish I was just doing an actual video,

107
00:05:06,063 --> 00:05:07,775
so you could hear that.

108
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:09,777
But I wanted to pop in and tell you that,

109
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,516
because it was really
really cool to see that

110
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:13,491
and to hear that.

111
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:16,253
All of the roaring applause
for these cast members.

112
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:20,199
And it made it feel like a good departure

113
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,448
of the cruise as well.

114
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,281
(signal tone)

115
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,864
(bright music)

116
00:05:29,004 --> 00:05:30,601
- We are getting ready
for the Mickey Mouse

117
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:32,434
character dance party!

118
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,593
Everyone's starting to dance already,

119
00:05:35,593 --> 00:05:37,353
especially your brother.

120
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:38,538
- [Jared] He's killin' it.

121
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,371
Yeah.

122
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:41,652
Wow.

123
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,241
(bright music)

124
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:53,458
(bright music)

125
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,013
Whoa!

126
00:07:35,395 --> 00:07:39,411
- Chip and Dale totally
butt-pushed Calvin.

127
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,113
It was funny.

128
00:07:41,113 --> 00:07:41,946
- Bye!

129
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,952
(cheering)

130
00:07:44,952 --> 00:07:45,785
- Three.

131
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,897
- Three.

132
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:49,349
- Four.

133
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:50,185
Okay, let's do it together.

134
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:51,018
One

135
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:54,152
two.

136
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:54,985
One

137
00:07:56,827 --> 00:07:57,683
two.

138
00:07:57,683 --> 00:07:59,117
- When I picked Jackson
up at the kids' club,

139
00:07:59,117 --> 00:08:00,893
he said, I did so many things,

140
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:03,018
I don't even want to tell you about it.

141
00:08:03,018 --> 00:08:05,794
He had so much fun at the kids club,

142
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:06,930
because every time we came to pick him up

143
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,249
I'm like what did you do, what did you do?

144
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:09,693
And I think today he was like,

145
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:10,943
I did so much.

146
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:13,678
They're doing something
special for dinner tonight.

147
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:17,595
So Ashley and Calvin has
been drawing Calvin's,

148
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:22,578
and then everyone has to
draw in the white line.

149
00:08:22,578 --> 00:08:24,614
We may have to give
you mine and you do it,

150
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:27,241
because we can't draw out
of the white line, okay?

151
00:08:27,241 --> 00:08:29,859
(Ellie laughs)

152
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,109
Now draw a big smiley face.

153
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:34,684
- [Jared] Yeah.

154
00:08:34,684 --> 00:08:39,241
- Can you draw the shirt
inside the white line?

155
00:08:39,241 --> 00:08:40,440
Perfect.
- Perfect.

156
00:08:40,441 --> 00:08:41,371
- [Jared] There you go.

157
00:08:41,371 --> 00:08:42,966
I think my character's really really happy

158
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:44,935
to be alive right now.

159
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,380
You know, don't you think?

160
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,198
He's just happy to be alive.
- That's so true.

161
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:53,365
- [Jared] His hands, I'm
not sure about that though.

162
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,351
- [Ellie] His eyes, I look over,

163
00:09:00,351 --> 00:09:02,683
yep yep, they're out.

164
00:09:02,683 --> 00:09:04,970
He was literally watching the iPad,

165
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:07,720
and it was like oh yep, he's out.

166
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,560
Aww, he's gonna miss dinner.

167
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,727
Extra dessert.

168
00:09:13,813 --> 00:09:16,071
They're gonna show your drawing

169
00:09:16,071 --> 00:09:18,060
up on the screen for everyone to see.

170
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,522
- A colorful entrance (laughs).

171
00:09:20,522 --> 00:09:22,452
Oh hiya folks.

172
00:09:22,452 --> 00:09:26,192
Gosh, thanks for all
of the great drawings.

173
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,746
These are just what I need to whip up

174
00:09:27,746 --> 00:09:29,829
a little animation magic.

175
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,840
(laughs)

176
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,077
- [Ellie] Only at Disney, will you insist

177
00:09:35,077 --> 00:09:38,034
on making a bed for our child.

178
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:39,334
Only at Disney.

179
00:09:39,334 --> 00:09:40,167
Thank you.

180
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:43,334
We said no, but they kind of insisted.

181
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,667
- Only at Disney, you know,

182
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:49,106
only at Disney.

183
00:09:49,106 --> 00:09:51,689
(Ellie laughs)

184
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,752
- [Jared] They even made a pillow for him.

185
00:09:54,752 --> 00:09:55,970
And there's a block right here,

186
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,720
so he can't fall off.

187
00:09:59,153 --> 00:10:00,434
Thank you guys, thank you.

188
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,267
- My pleasure.

189
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,100
- [Jared] Thank you.

190
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,517
And wait for it, wait for it,

191
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,938
and he's out too.

192
00:10:07,938 --> 00:10:11,438
Aww man, the show hasn't even started yet.

193
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,140
- He's so tired.

194
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,727
(Jared laughs)

195
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:19,394
(magical music)

196
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:27,907
- [Jared] Oh that's mine right there!

197
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,574
There's mine, Ellie.

198
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:34,963
There's Mom.

199
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,823
(clapping)

200
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:39,656
Yeah!

201
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:50,672
(enchanting music)

202
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,510
(stopwatch ticking)

203
00:10:57,014 --> 00:10:57,847
(signal tone)

204
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,444
We just had our last dinner

205
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:02,986
with all the people that we
have been enjoying dinner with.

206
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:06,250
Our server Ashley, his partner Diogo,

207
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,265
our friends Allison and Ken,

208
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,617
and it was just awesome.

209
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:14,328
I've been telling everyone
that I've been talking to,

210
00:11:14,328 --> 00:11:16,943
on board, all of the cast members that

211
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,295
it's really hard to describe exactly

212
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:22,096
how I felt about this cruise,

213
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:25,547
because I just don't think magical

214
00:11:25,547 --> 00:11:28,630
really expresses the way that I feel.

215
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:30,555
Magical is the word,

216
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:31,997
but I just feel like there's enough

217
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:33,949
power behind that word.

218
00:11:33,949 --> 00:11:34,790
It is magical,

219
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,207
and we had such a great time.

220
00:11:38,148 --> 00:11:40,981
The cast members here, I was like,

221
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:43,430
are we getting special service,

222
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,549
because everyone here has been so amazing,

223
00:11:45,549 --> 00:11:47,405
and Allison and Ken, who actually work

224
00:11:47,405 --> 00:11:48,787
for Disney Cruise Lines, they were like,

225
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:51,467
no that's just how everyone is here,

226
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:54,290
and I was like holy crap,
this has been amazing.

227
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,087
- Like when Calvin fell asleep.

228
00:11:56,087 --> 00:11:58,238
- When Calvin fell asleep, exactly,

229
00:11:58,238 --> 00:11:59,962
and they made a bed for him

230
00:11:59,962 --> 00:12:00,945
so I could eat dinner.

231
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,651
- It's been a very innocent week.

232
00:12:02,651 --> 00:12:03,484
- [Jared] Yeah.

233
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:04,317
- It's been so

234
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:07,243
I think my favorite thing this week

235
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:09,834
was dancing with the characters.

236
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,278
- [Jared] Oh yeah, the dance party.

237
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:12,838
- The boys loved it.

238
00:12:12,838 --> 00:12:15,579
Calvin and Jackson were
on cloud 10 dancing

239
00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:17,755
with Mickey and Pluto.

240
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:18,588
And I loved it.

241
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,105
That was like one of my favorite parts.

242
00:12:20,105 --> 00:12:20,938
- Absolutely.

243
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:23,925
We've had so many fun parts of this trip.

244
00:12:23,925 --> 00:12:26,677
I can't even put a finger on exactly one.

245
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:29,803
The variety shows, the Broadways shows,

246
00:12:29,803 --> 00:12:31,937
the ports
- The Broadway shows at night.

247
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:32,770
- [Jared] Yeah.

248
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,228
- [Ellie] The kids,
when they stayed up late

249
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,428
and watched those, loved the shows.

250
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:37,845
- We are just packing up

251
00:12:37,845 --> 00:12:40,715
and I'm just trying to
think of the best way

252
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:41,548
to describe it.

253
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:46,219
And magical, I mean it
was just magical for us,

254
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:47,992
magical for the kids,

255
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:50,696
and I think that's the
cool thing about it,

256
00:12:50,696 --> 00:12:52,229
is Ellie and I are adults,

257
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,261
Jackson and Calvin are
two and three years old

258
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,749
and they had a magical time too.

259
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:59,165
This is one of the best trips

260
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:02,485
that we have ever gone on with our family.

261
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:05,405
I told Ellie, I said
this is the best vacation

262
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,141
we have ever been on.

263
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:09,885
So definitely consider a Disney cruise

264
00:13:09,885 --> 00:13:11,236
for one of your family vacations.

265
00:13:11,236 --> 00:13:13,284
- This has definitely been refreshing.

266
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:16,633
We have decided to turn off our phones

267
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:18,050
and just be here,

268
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,966
and that has been amazing, as well.

269
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:23,469
- Absolutely,

270
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:27,200
and I think that's one thing that,

271
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,428
this is the first time we've done this

272
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:30,219
since we started daily vlogs

273
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:33,197
and I think it's nice
to be able to have this,

274
00:13:33,197 --> 00:13:35,007
and so I think, not all of the time,

275
00:13:35,007 --> 00:13:37,949
but this is something that we may do,

276
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:41,842
something like this just like
an unplug session, to just

277
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:42,950
- [Ellie] Once in a while.

278
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,887
- Goosfraba every once in a while, so.

279
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:47,186
(howling)

280
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:48,019
(laughing)

281
00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:48,852
- Mecham family vacation,

282
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,662
(howling)

283
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:54,648
And this is kind of how
a lot of our nights went.

284
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:55,798
- We're watching Peter Pan.

285
00:13:55,798 --> 00:13:58,564
- Yes, we are, we would
have a little movie playing

286
00:13:58,564 --> 00:14:00,082
for the kids, because
they have every single

287
00:14:00,082 --> 00:14:03,484
Disney movie in the whole
entire world on these TVs.

288
00:14:03,484 --> 00:14:04,814
We're just having a little
snack before dinner.

289
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:07,129
- And Jared always goes
to this certain place

290
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,127
to get his pizza because it's thin crust

291
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,086
and it's so good.

292
00:14:10,086 --> 00:14:11,660
- [Jared] It's so stinking good.

293
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,493
- This is our night routine.

294
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,754
- Yeah, our night routine, it's so fun.

295
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,062
And I love this.

296
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,436
This is like a memory
that we'll have forever,

297
00:14:18,436 --> 00:14:20,468
is us sitting here eating pizza

298
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:21,979
watching a Disney movie.
- Late.

299
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:22,986
- Yeah late at night.

300
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:25,855
Way past your bedtime (kisses).

301
00:14:25,855 --> 00:14:29,301
Way past your bedtime (kisses).

302
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:32,278
Did you guys have so
much fun on this cruise?

303
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:33,111
Yeah?

304
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:35,417
Did you have so much fun on the cruise?

305
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,250
Yeah?

306
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,688
- You know what, I want
to stay on here forever.

307
00:14:38,688 --> 00:14:40,013
- Oh it was that much fun, huh?

308
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:41,158
That was our trip.

309
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:42,342
That was our vacation.

310
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,029
- Back to reality.

311
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:45,665
- Back to reality.
- Smack into force gravity.

312
00:14:45,665 --> 00:14:46,498
- Oh there goes gravity,

313
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:48,852
something about Mom's spaghetti.

314
00:14:48,852 --> 00:14:51,674
Okay, we will see you guys next time.

315
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,746
Thank you so much for
watching our wonderful

316
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,870
Disney cruise vacation.

317
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,809
It was magical.

318
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:00,075
Say goodnight nose picker.

319
00:15:00,075 --> 00:15:00,908
Say bye bye.

320
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:01,741
- Bye.

321
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:03,074
- One two three.

322
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:06,983
(howling)

323
00:15:06,983 --> 00:15:09,976
- And that's a wrap on
the Mecham vacation.

324
00:15:09,976 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yay, bye.
