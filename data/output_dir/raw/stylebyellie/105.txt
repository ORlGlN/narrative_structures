1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:02,434
- Hey guys, it's Jared

2
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,934
and I have a blog with people.

3
00:00:05,782 --> 00:00:06,615
- What's up?

4
00:00:06,615 --> 00:00:11,296
- These are the people
that I love them so much.

5
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,465
And this is my evil twin.
- Is that what I sound like?

6
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:14,826
- Do I really sound like that?

7
00:00:14,826 --> 00:00:15,926
Hey, hi guys.

8
00:00:15,926 --> 00:00:16,759
Hey how's it going?
- Hey what's up?

9
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:17,592
- Hey dude,
- Hey sexy.

10
00:00:17,592 --> 00:00:18,425
- when you're ready,

11
00:00:18,425 --> 00:00:19,258
- [Jared] I'm ready.

12
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:20,091
- we're doing like a walkthrough.

13
00:00:20,091 --> 00:00:20,924
- [Jared] Yeah, let's do it.

14
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:21,757
- Do you wanna go see the space?

15
00:00:21,757 --> 00:00:22,590
- Yeah, everyone say hi.

16
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,886
Hi guys.
- Hey.

17
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:26,010
- We're here at the broadcasting building

18
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,981
and we're walking into the
place where the magic happens.

19
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:30,805
Stacey is gonna show us everything.

20
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:32,384
- We're behind the scenes right now,

21
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:33,218
- [Jared] Oh my goodness gracious.

22
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:34,313
- so you're getting a little sneaky peaky.

23
00:00:34,313 --> 00:00:35,797
We have all these, you're
gonna see these challenges

24
00:00:35,797 --> 00:00:37,378
in action, but this is kind of the space.

25
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:38,602
This is the game show space

26
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:39,867
we're gonna be using right now.

27
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,930
- [Jared] This looks like a legit studio

28
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,923
game show place.

29
00:00:42,923 --> 00:00:44,094
- Oh it is.

30
00:00:44,094 --> 00:00:44,927
(laughs)

31
00:00:44,927 --> 00:00:45,760
- [Jared] That's so cool.

32
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,051
- Like not all the time, but today.

33
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:47,884
- Like--

34
00:00:47,884 --> 00:00:49,358
- We have some of the brilliant minds

35
00:00:49,358 --> 00:00:52,148
and muscles behind everything going on.

36
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:52,981
- [Jared] This is so cool.

37
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:53,814
I feel like I could stand up here

38
00:00:53,814 --> 00:00:55,607
and say, hello I'm Chris Harrison

39
00:00:55,607 --> 00:00:57,054
and welcome to The Bachelor.

40
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:59,441
You know I feel like
I could say that here.

41
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:00,727
- The Bachelor on YouTube--

42
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,135
- Or like (laughs),

43
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:04,301
I'm Drew Carey and this
is The Price is Right

44
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,668
or something like that.
- Yeah.

45
00:01:05,668 --> 00:01:07,068
- It's so cool.
- Okay.

46
00:01:07,068 --> 00:01:07,901
- [Jared] This looks great.

47
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,150
- So they've already read us the rules,

48
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,941
and we're gonna walk through the game,

49
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:12,651
so we can be familiar as the hosts.

50
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:13,729
- Perfect, yeah.

51
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,161
Stacey and I are hosting this place up.

52
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,628
- This is gonna be so hosted up.

53
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:18,777
- Dude, straight up hosting.
- You have no idea.

54
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:20,860
- [Jared] Oh my goodness.

55
00:01:24,564 --> 00:01:27,294
(cascading ice)

56
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:28,127
- Are you ready for this dude?
- You ready?

57
00:01:28,127 --> 00:01:29,172
- I am.

58
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,513
You're doing this with me, right, so.

59
00:01:31,513 --> 00:01:34,974
- Well I guess it depends on
how well the person throws it.

60
00:01:34,974 --> 00:01:35,807
- I know.

61
00:01:35,807 --> 00:01:37,589
I'm really hoping that
your team loses this one,

62
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:40,100
like more than any of
the other competitions.

63
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,364
- This is way too much ice.

64
00:01:42,364 --> 00:01:43,609
- [Matt] This was full.

65
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:46,552
- [Jared] Yeah yeah, it
was like up to here of ice.

66
00:01:46,552 --> 00:01:47,385
Oh jeez.

67
00:01:47,385 --> 00:01:48,482
I think that's good guys.

68
00:01:48,482 --> 00:01:49,514
I think that's good.

69
00:01:49,514 --> 00:01:50,971
(cascading ice)

70
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,888
- Is this yours?
- Awww!

71
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:57,180
- Oh, it's like a foot deep.

72
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,688
- That's a lot of ice.
- It's like a foot of ice.

73
00:01:58,688 --> 00:01:59,836
- That's a lot of ice.

74
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:02,140
- [Jared] Yeah, I don't even
know if we'll break through it.

75
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,973
- Oh my goodness.

76
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,777
- I don't think we'll break through it.

77
00:02:04,777 --> 00:02:06,235
That is so much ice.
- Oh my gosh.

78
00:02:06,235 --> 00:02:08,541
- You're going to
potentially fall in there.

79
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,247
- Wait who is it, who's on this one?

80
00:02:10,247 --> 00:02:11,080
- [Jared] Me and Matt.

81
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,445
- You and Matt?
- Me and Matt.

82
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:13,278
- That's great.

83
00:02:13,278 --> 00:02:15,934
- You're gonna need a lot more
than your matching t-shirts

84
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:17,526
to beat my team of YouTubers.

85
00:02:17,526 --> 00:02:19,602
(cheering)

86
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:22,518
- Welcome to the burn simulator.

87
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:24,944
(cheering)

88
00:02:24,944 --> 00:02:25,885
Oh my goodness.

89
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:26,718
- [Man] You can do it.

90
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:27,748
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

91
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:28,581
- I think we just won.

92
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,899
I think we just won this.

93
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:30,732
(laughing)

94
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:34,899
(bell dings)
(cheering)

95
00:02:38,781 --> 00:02:40,346
You should probably lay
low for a little bit.

96
00:02:40,346 --> 00:02:41,545
You look like you're in trouble.

97
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,795
- Full of frozen ice water.

98
00:02:44,685 --> 00:02:45,518
- [Woman] Ooh.

99
00:02:45,518 --> 00:02:47,785
- [Stacey] Gentlemen
load it up with the ice.

100
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:48,952
Final touches.

101
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,826
- [All] More ice, more ice!

102
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,687
More ice, more ice!

103
00:02:53,687 --> 00:02:55,715
More ice, more ice!

104
00:02:55,715 --> 00:02:56,548
More ice!

105
00:02:56,548 --> 00:02:58,484
- [Jared] Look at these
kids out in the snow.

106
00:02:58,484 --> 00:03:00,345
They found a cat, one
of our neighbor's cats

107
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:02,974
jumped our fence and
it's the nicest cat ever

108
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,730
and these kids are going over,

109
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,892
and the cat's just letting them pet it.

110
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:07,725
Like how sweet is that?

111
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:09,023
- [Ellie] Jackson has
picked it up a few times.

112
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,542
- I know and it's just like okay,

113
00:03:11,542 --> 00:03:12,375
I'm just gonna purr right here,

114
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,593
while you pick me up.

115
00:03:13,593 --> 00:03:14,801
- [Bonnie] Look at 'em like herd,

116
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:16,919
like crowd around the kitty.
- I know.

117
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,015
- [Bonnie] They're like come here.

118
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:20,158
Oh and there's snow on his back now.

119
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,302
- [Jared] Follow me this way guys.

120
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:23,699
Let's go out in the sun where it's warm,

121
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,546
as you pet me.

122
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:27,834
Follow me this way, chop chop here we go,

123
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:28,917
into the sun.

124
00:03:29,952 --> 00:03:32,562
I'm just gonna rub against
this fence real quick.

125
00:03:32,562 --> 00:03:34,080
Oh yes.
- Awww.

126
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,463
- [All] Awww.

127
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:37,848
- [Jared] Wa wa, sorry
boys you can't cut through

128
00:03:37,848 --> 00:03:38,681
the fence like that.

129
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:39,846
- [Ellie] That was funny.

130
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,197
- That was funny, it was cute.

131
00:03:41,197 --> 00:03:42,030
Oh there's Lincoln.

132
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,869
(Jared laughing)

133
00:03:43,869 --> 00:03:45,908
He finally made it.

134
00:03:45,908 --> 00:03:47,138
Hey guys, where'd the cat go?

135
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:50,576
Okay, gotta find something else to do now.

136
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:52,175
Let's go down the slide.

137
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:54,134
(laughing)

138
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,134
As you wish.

139
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,886
(laughing)

140
00:03:58,886 --> 00:04:01,243
Jackson is a penguin.

141
00:04:01,243 --> 00:04:03,420
- [Ellie] Look at that.

142
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,253
- [Bonnie] And the two
babies are still like,

143
00:04:04,253 --> 00:04:07,672
please come back, we'll lure
you in with a handful of snow.

144
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:09,077
(laughing)

145
00:04:09,077 --> 00:04:09,910
- [Jared] And over on
this side of the fence,

146
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:11,483
we've got a dog.

147
00:04:11,483 --> 00:04:13,659
(Jared laughs)

148
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:14,946

149
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:16,189

00:04:23,954 --> 00:04:26,208
(laughing)

154
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,041
- Oh the cat's back!
- The cat's back.

155
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:28,834
- [Jared] The cat's back!

156
00:04:28,834 --> 00:04:32,417
That cat's back!
(laughing)

157
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:35,916
I told you he'd be back.

158
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,337
- [Ellie] Tell Calvin, get up there.

159
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:41,215
- [Jared] Calvin, turn
around, the cat's back.

160
00:04:41,215 --> 00:04:43,011
Calvin look behind you.

161
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,138
The cat's back.

162
00:04:44,138 --> 00:04:45,497
Jackson, the cat's back.

163
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:46,330
Go say hi.

164
00:04:47,386 --> 00:04:48,649
- Okay.

165
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:49,697
- [Jared] Okay.

166
00:04:49,697 --> 00:04:51,018
- [Bonnie] I don't know
what that cat's thinking,

167
00:04:51,018 --> 00:04:52,185
but I'm happy.

168
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:54,851
- [Jared] Look they finally spotted him.

169
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:56,239
Get him Calvin.

170
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,436
- I think we have to disclaim.

171
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:01,020
We normally wouldn't
be petting strange cats

172
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,079
but we know that--

173
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,431
- [Jared] This is our neighbor's cat.

174
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:05,640
- Yeah.
- So we know it's good.

175
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,670
- [Ellie] I mean, if Penny
was outside right now

176
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,717
she'd be going crazy.

177
00:05:08,717 --> 00:05:09,740
- [Jared] The cat would not be here,

178
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,666
if Penny was outside right now.

179
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,966
- [Bonnie] The cat would be eaten.

180
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:15,959
I'm surprised that--

181
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,551
- And it's gone.
- Awww.

182
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:20,498
- [Bonnie] Boston, you overzealous.

183
00:05:20,498 --> 00:05:22,064
- [Ellie] That was really funny.

184
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:23,425
- Let's go slide down on
our bellies again Boston,

185
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:24,508
that was fun.

186
00:05:25,534 --> 00:05:27,214
- Bonnie and I are just
sitting hanging out.

187
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:28,745
And the kids are playing.

188
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,886
And I think both of our kids

189
00:05:29,886 --> 00:05:31,558
needed someone to play with today,

190
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,905
so it nice that we have cousins.

191
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:34,558
- Yeah, thank you.

192
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:35,676
- [Ellie] So close, but it's cute.

193
00:05:35,676 --> 00:05:36,694
We're literally sitting here,

194
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,953
we've been watching them play

195
00:05:37,953 --> 00:05:39,578
for probably 40 minutes.

196
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:42,137
Oh my gosh guys, we might have

197
00:05:42,137 --> 00:05:43,928
to get a cat too.

198
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,799
No Penny would hate that.

199
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:46,961
- How does Calvin even know?

200
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:48,115
He's like picking him up.

201
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,779
He's rubbing his face against it.

202
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,891
- Calvin is holding that cat,

203
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:53,604
and the cat is not--

204
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,480
- [Bonnie] Not running away.

205
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,331
- He keeps picking it up,

206
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:59,237
and the cat is just still staying by him

207
00:05:59,237 --> 00:06:00,467
when he puts him down.

208
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,756
- I cannot believe that.

209
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:03,756
Put me down.

210
00:06:05,596 --> 00:06:07,020
He's carrying him.

211
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,030
Calvin's like no, let me help you.

212
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,125
- [Ellie] Oh now Jackson took him away

213
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,125
and he's picking him up.

214
00:06:16,137 --> 00:06:17,928
(Bonnie laughs)

215
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:20,220
And he's being so good.

216
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,805
Okay, I'll have to text
our neighbor and tell her,

217
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:26,067
that her cat is actually cute.

218
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,222
Because usually when it comes in the yard,

219
00:06:27,222 --> 00:06:28,059
we're like get out of here,

220
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:30,936
because Penny's like, we're done with you.

221
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:32,714
That was cute.
- That was the sweetest.

222
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:33,547
- Jared.

223
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:34,415
- What is going on?

224
00:06:34,415 --> 00:06:36,938
- The cat is not running away from Calvin.

225
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,710
- [Bonnie] Because he knows he loves him.

226
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,054
- Calvin is--
- Aww.

227
00:06:40,054 --> 00:06:41,536
- Look at him pet it.

228
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,816
- Well and look at him pick him up.

229
00:06:43,816 --> 00:06:46,294
Look, yep, there he goes,
he's picking him up.

230
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,929
(laughing)

231
00:06:48,929 --> 00:06:50,272
- Oh my gosh.

232
00:06:50,272 --> 00:06:52,222
- That cat's probably not old.

233
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:55,055
That cat's probably still a kitty.

234
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,353
Oh and then Lincoln's hitting it with--

235
00:06:58,353 --> 00:07:00,105
- Yeah yeah.
- Now he's gone.

236
00:07:00,105 --> 00:07:02,383
- Way to ruin it for everyone Lincoln.

237
00:07:02,383 --> 00:07:03,866
Cat's like I'm done.

238
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,656
- Guys guys guys guys
guys guys guys guys guys,

239
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:08,248
Joel just called me.

240
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,789
- Are you gonna go to the movies?

241
00:07:09,789 --> 00:07:11,020
- I think Joel and I
are gonna go to a movie.

242
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,740
Ellie can I go to a
movie with Joel, please?

243
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,882
- Oh my gosh I feel sick

244
00:07:13,882 --> 00:07:15,738
that you're vlogging and asking me this,

245
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:18,052
because I don't want anyone--

246
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:19,735
I don't care.

247
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,555
- Well of course I can go.
- Can I go to the movie?

248
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,435
- But it's funny to
come down here and ask.

249
00:07:23,435 --> 00:07:25,379
You're watching a movie right now.

250
00:07:25,379 --> 00:07:26,473
Guess what?

251
00:07:26,473 --> 00:07:28,434
You've been a bad boy.
- Hey, you just came

252
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,601
- downstairs and disrupted
what I was doing.

253
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:31,434
- [Jared] Uh-oh.

254
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:32,333
- Get out of here.

255
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,220
- [Jared] You bet it, you bet I am.

256
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,053
- Have fun.

257
00:07:35,053 --> 00:07:35,886
- [Jared] We will.

258
00:07:35,886 --> 00:07:37,283
- Cheer Joel up for me, okay?

259
00:07:37,283 --> 00:07:38,116
- [Jared] I will.

260
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:38,949
- He's falling asleep.

261
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:41,138
- [Jared] Oh I'm so sorry.

262
00:07:41,138 --> 00:07:42,971
- Hey have fun.
- Okay.

263
00:07:43,977 --> 00:07:47,014
- I really would like an
Instant Pot for Christmas.

264
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:49,542
(laughing)

265
00:07:49,542 --> 00:07:50,792
Bye.
- Okay bye.

266
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:55,860
- I'll put in a good
word with Santa Claus.

267
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,110
- I knew he would be asleep any second.

268
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:03,038
He came up to me, and was like ahhh,

269
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:04,753
like he just wanted to cuddle.

270
00:08:04,753 --> 00:08:07,055
I knew he was tired and he fell asleep.

271
00:08:07,055 --> 00:08:09,766
From when Calvin was three day sold,

272
00:08:09,766 --> 00:08:11,026
I knew he was a cuddler.

273
00:08:11,026 --> 00:08:13,074
I remember putting him on my bed,

274
00:08:13,074 --> 00:08:13,994
and I was getting dressed

275
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,314
and he was whining and crying,

276
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,578
and I remember thinking,

277
00:08:17,578 --> 00:08:19,754
I thought babies were supposed to sleep.

278
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:21,923
Like it was so weird that
the moment I put him down,

279
00:08:21,923 --> 00:08:23,486
he was kind of whiny.

280
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:26,390
And he's always been such a cuddler.

281
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,361
Hey hey, are you guys having fun

282
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,034
or are you fighting?

283
00:08:30,034 --> 00:08:31,741
- Lincoln's not having fun.

284
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:32,888
- [Ellie] Are you having fun?

285
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,154
And these boys back here,

286
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:37,904
they are all playing with Lego's.

287
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:39,882
So cute.

288
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,581
I love seeing our boys play

289
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:44,414
and sleep.

290
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:45,247
(Jared whistles)

291
00:08:45,247 --> 00:08:46,080
- [Jared] Come here puppy.

292
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,334
Puppy puppy, aww, good puppy.

293
00:08:48,334 --> 00:08:50,274
Do you want a treat?
- He's been a good puppy.

294
00:08:50,274 --> 00:08:53,075
- [Jared] Aww, that's so cute and sweet.

295
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:53,908
Oh, Mommy's calling you.

296
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,554
Good puppy.

297
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:57,598
- Aww, what a good puppy.

298
00:08:57,598 --> 00:08:59,982
- Puppy Calvin, Calvin.

299
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:01,649
- Good doggie.
- Aww.

300
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:06,928
- I used to act like a
dog until I was like 12.

301
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:08,567
(Jared laughs)

302
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:09,400
- Calvin?

303
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,518
- Mmm?

304
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:12,227
- The dog talks.

305
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:13,155
- Oh yeah.
(laughing)

306
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:13,988
- Oh yeah.

307
00:09:15,005 --> 00:09:16,431
He said oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

308
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:17,989
- You may have noticed that Ellie and I

309
00:09:17,989 --> 00:09:20,974
have our matching sweaters on.

310
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:22,438
Cookies for Santa, nay!

311
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,244
- It's so cute and comfy.

312
00:09:24,244 --> 00:09:25,497
- Cookies for me.

313
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:26,688
- And I think we're
gonna wear the same thing

314
00:09:26,688 --> 00:09:28,904
tomorrow for the party,

315
00:09:28,904 --> 00:09:30,322
- the neighborhood party.
- Oh we totally will.

316
00:09:30,322 --> 00:09:31,210
- We'll wash 'em and wear 'em tomorrow.

317
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,043
- Absolutely.

318
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:33,024
We have a neighborhood party

319
00:09:33,024 --> 00:09:34,214
and I'm playing the guitar for it

320
00:09:34,214 --> 00:09:36,286
and I'm not, I'm nay prepared.

321
00:09:36,286 --> 00:09:37,566
I need to practice and play more,

322
00:09:37,566 --> 00:09:39,981
because it's gonna be
embarrassing if I play

323
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:41,507
the wrong notes in front
of a lot of people.

324
00:09:41,507 --> 00:09:42,561
- [Ellie] No you're good.

325
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:45,442
- But I filmed with
Studio C the other day,

326
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:47,874
and we had this crazy contest competition

327
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:49,242
and it just went live on YouTube.

328
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:51,074
So Ellie and I are gonna grab our phones

329
00:09:51,074 --> 00:09:52,223
and we're gonna sit down,
and we're gonna watch it

330
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,681
as a family, all one hour of it.

331
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:55,732
- Oh careful please.

332
00:09:55,732 --> 00:09:57,598
Where they dunk you

333
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:58,450
in ice water.
- Mmm-hmm.

334
00:09:58,450 --> 00:09:59,283
- Oh my gosh.

335
00:09:59,283 --> 00:10:00,258
It was a foot of ice water,

336
00:10:00,258 --> 00:10:02,140
very very cold, I'll have
a link to it down below

337
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,539
if you guys want to check it out.

338
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,122
(bright music)

339
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:17,901
I probably shouldn't say this,

340
00:10:17,901 --> 00:10:19,864
I might get reamed for saying this,

341
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,934
but pregnancy's kind of weird right?

342
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:23,437
Can we agree with that?

343
00:10:23,437 --> 00:10:25,052
Pregnancy's kind of weird?

344
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,115
Ellie's like what are you saying?

345
00:10:27,115 --> 00:10:29,776
Anyway, real quick, what I mean to say

346
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:32,242
is what pregnancy does to you

347
00:10:32,242 --> 00:10:33,342
(laughs) is kinda weird.

348
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,606
I think Ellie's cravings are leaning

349
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:38,030
toward the cheesy side.

350
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,311
Everything that Ellie's
wanted as a craving

351
00:10:41,311 --> 00:10:44,760
has cheese involved with
it some way or another.

352
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,078
- Don't judge me.
- She has just--

353
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,453
- She says don't judge me.

354
00:10:48,453 --> 00:10:50,326
Don't worry Ellie, we're not judging.

355
00:10:50,326 --> 00:10:51,705
It's not you we're judging,

356
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:54,758
it's what it does to
you that we're judging.

357
00:10:54,758 --> 00:10:56,778
She's like Jared go get me
a cheese pizza right now.

358
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:58,002
I need it stat.

359
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:02,282
So I'm going to get a
cheese pizza right now,

360
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:04,466
because pregnancy is cheesy apparently,

361
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,975
at least for this one
right now with Ellie.

362
00:11:06,975 --> 00:11:08,519
Okay seriously, I'm not trying to be rude,

363
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,531
I'm just saying it okay?

364
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,107
It's just, I don't know,

365
00:11:12,107 --> 00:11:13,315
I'm digging myself in a deeper hole Jared

366
00:11:13,315 --> 00:11:15,066
and you need to stop while you're ahead,

367
00:11:15,066 --> 00:11:16,929
or not that deep down.

368
00:11:16,929 --> 00:11:17,891
Okay bye.
(playful music)

369
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:18,802
- [Server] What can I get for ya.

370
00:11:18,802 --> 00:11:20,649
- Can I get a half cheese,

371
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,898
half pepperoni pizza?

372
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:23,914
- [Server] Alright, anything else I can

373
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,132
offer you tonight?

374
00:11:26,132 --> 00:11:28,207
- No, I think that should be it.

375
00:11:28,207 --> 00:11:31,698
I got your pizza and you've
got a little dinner buddy.

376
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:33,317
- Well I do feel a little weird,

377
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,692
you're like Ellie wanted pizza now.

378
00:11:34,692 --> 00:11:36,004
I ate lunch.

379
00:11:36,004 --> 00:11:37,785
I never skip dinner.

380
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:38,618
- [Jared] Yeah.

381
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:40,755
- And I was wondering, I was
like I feel worse tonight,

382
00:11:40,755 --> 00:11:42,596
like my head hurts and I'm sick

383
00:11:42,596 --> 00:11:44,332
and I shouldn't be eating pizza.

384
00:11:44,332 --> 00:11:47,190
But I totally skipped dinner.

385
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,142
Like I fed the kids and I'm like,

386
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,534
I didn't eat since lunch.

387
00:11:50,534 --> 00:11:52,645
- Yeah, so like you're starving.

388
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:55,160
And cheese, pregnancy
or something like that,

389
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:55,993
I don't know.

390
00:11:55,993 --> 00:11:56,826
- [Ellie] I guess I like cheese.

391
00:11:56,826 --> 00:11:59,156
- Whoa my voice just went like crazy.

392
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:00,584
- How sexy.
- Anyway.

393
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,850
- So it's the deep voice, okay,

394
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,239
I'll practice that, Jared remember that,

395
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:05,590
remember that, remember that.

396
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,621
- Moo.

397
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:08,094
- [Jared] You want more?

398
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:09,177
- No, moo my.

399
00:12:10,032 --> 00:12:11,539
- [Jared] Oh you want your moo.

400
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,193
Okay, I'll show you what his moo is.

401
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:15,026
- [Ellie] Say neigh.

402
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,321
- This is his moo.

403
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:17,749
This is his moo.

404
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:18,885
You want your moo?

405
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:19,718
- [Calvin] Yeah.

406
00:12:19,718 --> 00:12:21,799
- It's a horse.

407
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:22,632
Say horse.

408
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:25,830
He's saying moo.

409
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,269
He's going (whispers) moo.

410
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,677
Say horse.

411
00:12:28,677 --> 00:12:30,323
Say neigh.

412
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:31,156
- Neigh.

413
00:12:31,156 --> 00:12:31,989
- There you go.

414
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:34,582
(Jared laughs)

415
00:12:34,582 --> 00:12:35,730
Half neigh.

416
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,794
Well, we're back in the pantry.

417
00:12:37,794 --> 00:12:39,387

420
00:12:45,138 --> 00:12:47,030
