1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,390
- But when Jackson's done, he's come up

2
00:00:01,390 --> 00:00:02,870
with some brother names.

3
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:03,786
(yelling)

4
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,763
How many people are
cringing of that right now?

5
00:00:05,763 --> 00:00:08,232
Go get it girl, go get
it, go get it, go get it.

6
00:00:08,232 --> 00:00:10,167
How did we do this last year?

7
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:12,342
- [Kid] This is me.

8
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,857
- This is our entertainment for the night.

9
00:00:14,857 --> 00:00:17,922
We are running late for
an appointment today.

10
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:20,585
The tub is still full of water.

11
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:21,934
But I'm all dressed so
I don't want to drain it

12
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,896
right this second.

13
00:00:23,896 --> 00:00:25,368
We're running late, we gotta hurry.

14
00:00:25,368 --> 00:00:30,215
Our gender reveal is going up
tomorrow and we've had quite

15
00:00:30,215 --> 00:00:34,228
a few people upset that
we are two days behind

16
00:00:34,228 --> 00:00:36,514
and they've definitely
voiced their opinion

17
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:40,372
and just to reiterate, this
has been the best decision

18
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,622
Jared and I could have made for each other

19
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:44,255
being two days behind.

20
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:48,059
It's helped Jared a lot, not
being up 'til one and two

21
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,965
in the morning every single night editing.

22
00:00:50,965 --> 00:00:52,938
It's just been refreshing for me and him.

23
00:00:52,938 --> 00:00:54,167
I feel like we've been able to spend more

24
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:56,316
quality time together.

25
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:58,038
And so if we're going
to continue daily blogs,

26
00:00:58,038 --> 00:01:01,318
it has to this way and
I've really enjoyed it also

27
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:04,507
because I've been able to
just sit and enjoy knowing

28
00:01:04,507 --> 00:01:06,401
that I'm having a little boy on the way

29
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:10,090
and just really enjoy it
before I just like throw it out

30
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:14,332
and have, you know, lots of
comments or lots of attention

31
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,221
towards that and I really enjoyed that.

32
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:17,653
But when Jackson's done he's come up

33
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:20,397
with some brother names for brothers, so.

34
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:21,872
I'm gonna let him tell you.

35
00:01:21,872 --> 00:01:24,205
- Jackson, Calvin and Mason.

36
00:01:25,058 --> 00:01:27,891
- What other name did we think of?

37
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,150
- Charlie.

38
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,406
- Charlie, that's what Jackson
came up with this morning

39
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:35,234
was Charlie.

40
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:36,067
What do you like?

41
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:37,459
Do you like Charlie or Mason?

42
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:38,331
- Mason.

43
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,606
- Mason?

44
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:41,527
I like Mason the best too.

45
00:01:41,527 --> 00:01:42,840
- Hmm.

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,367
- I think you're so cute.

47
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:46,908
When we were, let's go get our shoes on.

48
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:50,522
When I was, when we were
pregnant with Calvin,

49
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,875
(whining)

50
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:54,108
You need more chocolate milk?

51
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:54,941
- Yeah.

52
00:01:54,941 --> 00:01:57,274
- Let's go get our shoes on.

53
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:02,521
When we were expecting Calvin
we came up with a few names,

54
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:03,863
Dalen.

55
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,539
I brought up, sorry the
lighting's kind of bad.

56
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:08,901
I brought up Mason a little
bit, but Jared didn't love,

57
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:09,734
love that.

58
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:12,209
I still really like the name Mason.

59
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,692
I think it's cute that Jackson,

60
00:02:13,692 --> 00:02:15,528
I didn't even tell Jared, Jackson came up

61
00:02:15,528 --> 00:02:17,663
with the name Charlie.

62
00:02:17,663 --> 00:02:18,496
- Charlie.

63
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,163
Aw.

64
00:02:21,163 --> 00:02:21,996
- [Mom] You look cute.

65
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:22,829
- Do you love this hoodie?

66
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,662
- [Mom] Where'd you get it?

67
00:02:23,662 --> 00:02:24,713
- I just ordered it online.

68
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:25,652
Well I didn't just order it.

69
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:26,485
But I got it in the mail

70
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:27,318
from Dicks.
- [Mom] Looks good.

71
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:28,151
- Like isn't this awesome?

72
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:28,984
- [Mom] Yeah.

73
00:02:28,984 --> 00:02:30,822
- Love it, it's comfy.

74
00:02:30,822 --> 00:02:31,927
- [Mom] Yeah, Charlie.

75
00:02:31,927 --> 00:02:33,477
- That's cute.

76
00:02:33,477 --> 00:02:36,002
- Jackson, Calvin and Charlie.

77
00:02:36,002 --> 00:02:37,766
Jackson, Calvin and Mason.

78
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:39,446
Do you like Charles?

79
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,782
- I like Charlie better than Charles.

80
00:02:41,782 --> 00:02:45,512
But I like Charles as in Charles Drippy.

81
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:47,429
- I like Charles a lot.

82
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:49,826
No, no I don't.

83
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:50,793
Nope, I said it and I don't.

84
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:51,626
(laughing)

85
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:53,419
I mean I like the name
but not for the baby.

86
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,477
- Where's my gray orichi shoes?

87
00:02:55,477 --> 00:02:56,310
- [Mom] Okay, gotta find them.

88
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,358
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

89
00:02:57,358 --> 00:03:00,849
Literally, okay so we
worked with a company like

90
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:03,016
six months ago and it was,

91
00:03:04,779 --> 00:03:07,685
it was the Orishi shoes that had come out.

92
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,550
And Jackson's shoes
aren't the Orishi shoes.

93
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,702
My shoes were called the Orishi shoes.

94
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:16,357
And Jackson every day, I
wanna wear my Orishi shoes,

95
00:03:16,357 --> 00:03:19,015
and he calls those his Orishi's.

96
00:03:19,015 --> 00:03:21,944
I think it's hilarious and so cute.

97
00:03:21,944 --> 00:03:22,937
(laughing)

98
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:25,560
We were in a little bit of a
rush getting out of the house.

99
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,708
And our car seats are out of the other car

100
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,664
because we took Bonnie and Joel
to Mom and Dad's last night

101
00:03:31,664 --> 00:03:33,253
so we got in this car.

102
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,398
And this is the car,

103
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:35,579
- That I take penny in,

104
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,597
all the time
- Everyday.

105
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:38,494
(chuckling)

106
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:39,717
- And Penny goes

107
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:40,707
(yelling)

108
00:03:40,707 --> 00:03:42,268
- How many people are
cringing of that right now?

109
00:03:42,268 --> 00:03:43,947
I am too, it's like all over your back.

110
00:03:43,947 --> 00:03:46,362
We just need to clean it, that's all.

111
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,260
Just clean it.

112
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,513
- You know, it doesn't
matter if we lint roll it.

113
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,319
If she's in here one
time that's what happens.

114
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:52,792
- [Mom] I know, I know.

115
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:53,817
And then there's like bird poop

116
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,935
all over the car.
- [Dad] Eli, our image!

117
00:03:56,935 --> 00:03:57,836
(laughing)

118
00:03:57,836 --> 00:03:58,991
Our image.

119
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,383
I can feel it melting.

120
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:03,728
- Has anybody else been
letting their chores slack off

121
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:05,207
before Christmas?

122
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:07,127
And is everybody else
running around trying

123
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:08,754
to get their chores done?

124
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:11,583
This is what a week, or
two weeks looks like.

125
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,794
I'd say about two weeks.

126
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:17,363
What it looks like with
me not doing laundry.

127
00:04:17,363 --> 00:04:19,130
(sighing)

128
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,130
K, I'm in for some work.

129
00:04:22,124 --> 00:04:24,628
I'm going to fold laundry
and put a smile on my face

130
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:25,871
even though this is what I want to do.

131
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:26,938
(fake crying)

132
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:29,526
Cry, but I'm gonna put a smile on my face.

133
00:04:29,526 --> 00:04:30,910
(laughing)

134
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,637
There's so much laundry!

135
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:36,637
And to think, here's
Jackson's, here's Calvin's,

136
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:40,995
there's gonna be another little boy's.

137
00:04:40,995 --> 00:04:42,834
So much laundry.

138
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:46,272
That's the hardest thing for
me to keep up, is the laundry.

139
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,378
That's the hardest part.

140
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,895
I need more lint rollers
because having Penny around

141
00:04:49,895 --> 00:04:53,168
like, especially during the
Winter, cause she's inside

142
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,024
a lot more.

143
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:57,344
I'm like, okay, we need to
like, lint roll everything

144
00:04:57,344 --> 00:04:59,565
and everyone and every wall.

145
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,996
So that's one thing I'm
gonna put on my list

146
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:02,767
is get some lint rollers.

147
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:06,850
Look at the icicles that
are in the snow, people.

148
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,386
That is so crazy.

149
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:10,969
It's so like, soft.

150
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:13,643
Hello.

151
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:14,476
- [Dad] Hello.

152
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:15,309
- [Mom] Hello.

153
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:16,183
- [Dad] Hello.

154
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,234
- [Mom] Penny did you spot something?

155
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,352
Go get it girl, go get it,
go get it, go get it girl.

156
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:21,834
(laughing)

157
00:05:21,834 --> 00:05:23,461
- [Kid] My turn.

158
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:24,864
This is me.

159
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:27,530
- [Mom] This is our
entertainment for the night.

160
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,816
Jumping onto a balloon, onto pillows.

161
00:05:30,816 --> 00:05:33,308
Everyone's happy, dandy and dory.

162
00:05:33,308 --> 00:05:34,257
- Just keep swimming.

163
00:05:34,257 --> 00:05:35,935
(cheering)

164
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,171
- You better hurry and move.

165
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,157
(yelling and laughing)

166
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,921
- [Kid] My turn, my turn.

167
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:42,942
- [Jackson] Okay, my turn.

168
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,870
- You gotta get out of the
way, gotta get out of the way.

169
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,875
- [Kid] My turn.

170
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:50,838
- I told Bonnie we have not
done this in a very long time.

171
00:05:50,838 --> 00:05:54,761
Where we sit in her basement
and just watch the kids play.

172
00:05:54,761 --> 00:05:57,301
We played a hide and seek game with them.

173
00:05:57,301 --> 00:05:59,665
And now they just found something
that will entertain them.

174
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:01,887
I feel like there's 1,000 voices.

175
00:06:01,887 --> 00:06:02,919
Can you hear me?

176
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:05,626
(laughing)

177
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:07,311
- It's kind of, I know, I know.

178
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,261
- I think it's funny.

179
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,902
Well I told Jared and I
told you guys the other day.

180
00:06:10,902 --> 00:06:12,907
I was like, yeah, we're totally
going to decorate our tree.

181
00:06:12,907 --> 00:06:15,891
Like, it would make me sad
if I just didn't decorate it.

182
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:18,153
And it's like, it's nighttime now.

183
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:21,170
We've been running around all
day and I'm like, you know,

184
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,979
it's not going to get decorated.

185
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,325
I'm a flip flopper this year guys.

186
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:27,857
And it's not going to, and that's,

187
00:06:27,857 --> 00:06:30,434
unless I change my mind
again which I might.

188
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,388
But for now, I'm going
to watch my kids play.

189
00:06:33,388 --> 00:06:34,782
And we're going to go home
and go to bed and then Jared

190
00:06:34,782 --> 00:06:38,432
and I are going to watch
some of the IVF Grant videos.

191
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:40,524
We gotta start doing those,
and I'm excited about.

192
00:06:40,524 --> 00:06:42,280
- [Bonnie] I feel like
you shouldn't do that.

193
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,971
- Just make a lavia dosa.

194
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:46,500
- [Bonnie] Oh my gosh, okay, thank you.

195
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,476
(laughing)

196
00:06:47,476 --> 00:06:49,114
- I wasn't going to put bulky on there.

197
00:06:49,114 --> 00:06:51,092
My luck, I'd fall right on my belly.

198
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:54,350
- [Kid] Mom, never watching me.

199
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,432
Mamma, record me.

200
00:06:56,432 --> 00:06:59,145
- Bonnie just made Olivia go.

201
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,648
And I was like, Olivia I'll go with you.

202
00:07:00,648 --> 00:07:02,398
K Jacks, let's watch.

203
00:07:03,364 --> 00:07:04,594
Yeah, he goes on his feet.

204
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:05,592
(laughing)

205
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,686
- Well, it is officially official.

206
00:07:07,686 --> 00:07:11,853
Eli and I have sent out our
Reddit secret santa gifts.

207
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:15,115
I'm really excited about this year.

208
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:18,023
Last year was a lot of fun
and Eli was really excited

209
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:18,965
to do it this year.

210
00:07:18,965 --> 00:07:20,371
We sent out our gifts.

211
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:23,583
Eli's secret santa has shipped her gift.

212
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:26,659
And we're just waiting to see
if mine makes it, we'll see.

213
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,808
But I'll keep you posted.

214
00:07:27,808 --> 00:07:30,113
I think secret santa things
like this, especially when

215
00:07:30,113 --> 00:07:32,032
you have no idea who the person is.

216
00:07:32,032 --> 00:07:35,242
You just have like a few
questionairre things to go off of.

217
00:07:35,242 --> 00:07:36,263
It's so much fun.

218
00:07:36,263 --> 00:07:39,868
Sam from, Samaca and I were
talking about it, and he has

219
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:41,836
a really cool person
that he's giving a gift,

220
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,545
a really sweet gift to also.

221
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,352
So I just, I love this kind of stuff.

222
00:07:46,352 --> 00:07:47,595
- And was that it?

223
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:49,203
Was that the blog?

224
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:51,252
I'm sitting here editing
the blog that you are

225
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:52,676
watching right now.

226
00:07:52,676 --> 00:07:54,517
Jared is getting a ton of work done.

227
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:58,166
It is, my eyes are so
tired, it is only 10:30.

228
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:02,698
We've been going over a lot
of the IVF applications.

229
00:08:02,698 --> 00:08:05,319
Last night and tonight we
need to go over a lot more.

230
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,523
So I'm trying to help Jared
out here while he's getting

231
00:08:07,523 --> 00:08:09,741
work done then we can go work together.

232
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,945
Thank you guys so much for
being patient, especially

233
00:08:11,945 --> 00:08:12,853
with today's blog.

234
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:15,392
As I was editing it I was
like, this is definitely more

235
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:18,663
of the simplest blogs we've had.

236
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:20,952
It was just like, kind of
like loungy, what we did

237
00:08:20,952 --> 00:08:21,852
for the day.

238
00:08:21,852 --> 00:08:24,688
We didn't like do anything
extra special but I hope

239
00:08:24,688 --> 00:08:26,280
that you guys did enjoy it.

240
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,166
I thought Jackson was sure sweet coming up

241
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,638
with the name Charlie.

242
00:08:29,638 --> 00:08:31,922
And just to let you guys
know, I did end up decorating

243
00:08:31,922 --> 00:08:33,323
the tree.

244
00:08:33,323 --> 00:08:36,627
I got some energy in me and
the kids and I decorated

245
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:39,284
and it was so fun and it's so beautiful.

246
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:40,510
And I'm so glad that I did that.

247
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,461
I hope that you guys
are having a good week

248
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:44,694
before Christmas.

249
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:46,612
I hope you guys have
some really fun plans.

250
00:08:46,612 --> 00:08:49,265
I think just the preparation
is one of the funnest things

251
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:52,174
for me, just like you know
getting the tree decorated,

252
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,503
having energy to do that,
going grocery shopping,

253
00:08:54,503 --> 00:08:56,516
getting everything that
I need in the house

254
00:08:56,516 --> 00:08:58,491
so that we can just have a really

255
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:02,400
at home enjoyable Christmas
just with my family.

256
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,155
I'm so excited for that.

257
00:09:04,155 --> 00:09:05,789
Last night when Jared
and I were going over

258
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,372
the IVF applications,
it was very draining.

259
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:14,613
But I don't say that in a
bad way, it's just emotional,

260
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:18,149
it's draining, it's people
putting their stories out there

261
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:19,824
for us to watch and listen.

262
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:23,225
And after like the third or
fourth video, I looked at Jared

263
00:09:23,225 --> 00:09:25,978
and I was like, how did
we do this last year?

264
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:27,530
How did we get through this?

265
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,090
Like, how are we gonna
get through it this year?

266
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:33,496
Like, how to possibly choose,
and it just, there's a lot

267
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:35,671
of amazing people out there
and there's a lot of deserving

268
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:36,615
people out there.

269
00:09:36,615 --> 00:09:40,604
And one of my absolute
favorite things is in all

270
00:09:40,604 --> 00:09:44,090
of the videos, at the
very end the people say,

271
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,029
we don't deserve this more
than any of the other people

272
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:48,176
that applied for this grant.

273
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:49,868
We wish everyone the best.

274
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:52,289
And that's what everyone
was saying last year too.

275
00:09:52,289 --> 00:09:55,763
And like just, it really just
goes to show you that there is

276
00:09:55,763 --> 00:09:56,905
a lot of good in the world.

277
00:09:56,905 --> 00:09:59,360
And it's hard to see that when it's like,

278
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,076
social media's just such a
huge thing, it's like you hear

279
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,888
and you see a lot of negativity.

280
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,805
And negativity's always been
there, always will be there.

281
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:11,915
But we just see it so much
more because it's out there.

282
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:14,014
You know, and at church
they were talking a

283
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:16,306
about balancing life
and how it's really hard

284
00:10:16,306 --> 00:10:18,814
to balance life because like
if you're at work, well then

285
00:10:18,814 --> 00:10:20,943
your family, and if
you're with your family,

286
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,375
sometimes you're neglecting work.

287
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:25,050
And it's just like you're
always being pulled

288
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:28,047
and it's just like a really
good reminder, like when

289
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,295
you're with your family,
really be with your family.

290
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,981
When you're at work, make
that time your work time.

291
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:36,633
And when you're at church or
if you're doing something,

292
00:10:36,633 --> 00:10:39,631
like make sure you're
time is in that time.

293
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,207
And I've been trying
extra hard to do that.

294
00:10:42,207 --> 00:10:45,377
Like, if I'm with the kids,
to not have my phone around me

295
00:10:45,377 --> 00:10:46,894
just so I don't even answer phone calls.

296
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:49,559
So I don't even be tempted
to look at like social media.

297
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,198
Just be with them.

298
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:53,195
And that's something that
Jared and I have been working

299
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,864
on a lot lately, is when
it's time to work, we work,

300
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:58,318
but then we'd be done, and
we have to just turn it off.

301
00:10:58,318 --> 00:11:01,060
You know, and I really enjoyed that.

302
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,436
And I don't know how I got
into this pill but I did.

303
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:04,269
But,

304
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:05,102
(laughing)

305
00:11:05,102 --> 00:11:06,421
that's just me talking.

306
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,441
So, thank you guys for watching.

307
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:10,944
Can't wait to watch some
more of those videos.

308
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:13,749
Get it in the blog, finish
editing this last clip,

309
00:11:13,749 --> 00:11:15,877
and then we'll get going with our night.

310
00:11:15,877 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye guys.
