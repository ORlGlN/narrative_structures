1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,598
- [Joel] A father of three, almost.

2
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:02,990
- Aahh!!

3
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,172
- One wrong move, I could fall through.

4
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,973
- What the heck?

5
00:00:07,973 --> 00:00:10,323
- Is this momma, am I momma?

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,284
(lauging)

7
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:17,820
- That's the only person
that he would ever say mm-hm.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,070
Normally he'd be like no.

9
00:00:20,071 --> 00:00:22,394
- [Jared] Cut it all off!

10
00:00:22,394 --> 00:00:23,560
- Not too intense tense,

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,295
but enough that I want a little ponytail.

12
00:00:26,295 --> 00:00:27,987
- This is kinda weird.

13
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:28,820
- Ah!

14
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:32,651
- Oh, it's a little ponytail.

15
00:00:32,651 --> 00:00:34,498
Oh that's so pretty.

16
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:36,760
- [Jared] That's funny.

17
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,680
- Aside from being an incredible handyman,

18
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,263
Joel is like, a master electrician.

19
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,158
Is it master or journeyman,
or what's your title?

20
00:00:45,158 --> 00:00:46,772
- Neither of those, but

21
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:49,900
it is master electrician
but I'm not qualified.

22
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,946
- Qualified.

23
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:53,290
We've got some electrical
stuff that we're working on

24
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,610
and we've got the ladder hooked up

25
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,179
and Joel and I are gonna go in the attic.

26
00:00:58,179 --> 00:01:00,320
And this is the first time,

27
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,080
I said addict.

28
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,190
We're going into the at-tic.

29
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,736
Not addict.

30
00:01:05,736 --> 00:01:08,090
And we're gonna go check it out.

31
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,638
This is the first time
I've ever been up there.

32
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,471
- [Joel] What?

33
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:12,600
- Yeah, I've peaked in there

34
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,090
but I've never gone up in there.

35
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,810
I think we did a video,
we peaked up in there

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,040
and I took a couple of steps and

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,810
I was like I don't wanna
fall through the ceiling.

38
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,920
So Joel is gonna lead the way

39
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,904
and I'm gonna follow him
and we're gonna look around.

40
00:01:22,904 --> 00:01:24,260
Pretty cold up there?

41
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,120
- Yeah, that's a good sign.

42
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,100
So grab your joists, yeah.

43
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,821
You wanna put all your weight on joists

44
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:31,840
and come up and put your foot on that one

45
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,393
that's crossbeam over there if you can.

46
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,607
Yeah, lift up and set
your feet on that one.

47
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:38,190
(bouncy music)

48
00:01:40,792 --> 00:01:42,713
A father of three, almost.

49
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,580
Your body's moving like it, too.

50
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,320
- Did it.

51
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,153
- [Joel] Doneski.

52
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:54,020
- So if you look over there,
you can see how deep this is.

53
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,220
22, 20 inches deep, of insulation.

54
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,990
- [Joel] Which is why your
house stays nice and warm.

55
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,060
- Yeah, boy!

56
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,190
So Joel and I are gonna
crawl down through there

57
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:07,870
in momentarily and we'll pull some wiring

58
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:11,420
through the entrance of the
attic down through there.

59
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,160
K, here's a little update.

60
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,718
Julie!

61
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:17,860
(bouncy music)

62
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,201
You look so great!

63
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:20,460
- Oh well, thank you.

64
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,870
- It is really cute.
- Good job.

65
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,790
- I cut it a little shorter than I wanted.

66
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,832
- That's okay.

67
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:27,050
- I was gonna say, that's
the beauty of hair,

68
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,070
is that it grows back.

69
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,614
Joel, you look like Spider-Man.

70
00:02:29,614 --> 00:02:32,223
- That's what they call me
in the electrical business.

71
00:02:32,223 --> 00:02:34,109
- Probably one of the
dumbest things I'm doing

72
00:02:34,109 --> 00:02:38,090
is vlogging and crawling through
the attic at the same time.

73
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,820
One wrong move, I could fall through.

74
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,830
We've got some wiring that we're
threading through over here

75
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,870
to get in a couple of extra outlets.

76
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,286
And luckily Joel knows what he's doing

77
00:02:49,286 --> 00:02:53,960
and I'm here for moral support
and to be his assistant.

78
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,053
- You just put the assist in assistant.

79
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:56,773
- [Jared] Oh thank you.

80
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:58,270
(lauging)

81
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,120
- Jared, I know you're not supposed

82
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,640
to covet your neighbors wife,

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,360
or your brother in law's wife

84
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,220
but I covet my brother in law's attic.

85
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,053
This is huge.

86
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,510
This is amazing to work in this.

87
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,630
- It's pretty cool.

88
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,965
Okay, we are above the patio.

89
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:13,308
You fall through here, you
don't have carpet to land on.

90
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,920
Okay, we are wiring all this through,

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,400
wrapping around up and
down, left and right,

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,580
sideways and backways for an outlet there.

93
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,670
We're gonna put an outlet over there,

94
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,697
we're gonna put an outlet over there,

95
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:27,370
and we're gonna put an outlet over here.

96
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,940
So three outlets.

97
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,190
It's starting to get hot.

98
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:34,430
Reminds me of the days
that I worked as a roofer.

99
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,166
Summer days, you get too hot,

100
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,550
the roofing material would like, melt,

101
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,883
and you would slide down.

102
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,080
I hope you guys enjoyed today's segment of

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,649
Jared and Joel go in the
attic and fix things.

104
00:03:46,649 --> 00:03:49,623
Luckily, we did everything
that we were supposed to

105
00:03:49,623 --> 00:03:52,024
before it started raining.

106
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:54,886
We have some rain and guess what?

107
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:57,530
That means it's not snow.

108
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,850
It's warm enough that it's not snow.

109
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,670
Thank goodness, oh my goodness gracious.

110
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,360
Okay, so now we're gonna
turn into another segment

111
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,300
where Jared and the kids do
some fun educational things.

112
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,610
So let's turn the time
over to that right now.

113
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,490
So last time we were here
we did a fun experiment

114
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,240
where we made a cloud in a bottle.

115
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,899
Jackson has been asking
so many questions lately

116
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,120
about the environment, the sky, the grass,

117
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
the colors of the world.

118
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,620
And I thought it would be fun

119
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,560
to answer these questions on
video with science experiments.

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,229
So one of the questions that Jackson asked

121
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:36,686
while we were on our drive
home from Las Vegas was

122
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:39,014
Why do clouds rain?

123
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:41,570
- Because there's thunder.

124
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,023
- That's close, now look,
is it raining outside?

125
00:04:44,023 --> 00:04:45,116
- Yeah.

126
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,686
- So what if I told you, Jackson,

127
00:04:47,686 --> 00:04:51,503
it's raining outside, but
what if we could make it rain

128
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:53,993
inside our house?

129
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:54,950
- Yeah.

130
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,406
- Would that be cool?

131
00:04:56,406 --> 00:04:57,239
- Yeah.

132
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,455
- Should we try to make
it rain inside our house?

133
00:04:58,455 --> 00:04:59,710
- Yeah.

134
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,755
- Or maybe, inside this bottle?

135
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:03,330
- Yeah.

136
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,216
- Okay, so what we're going
to do is to make it rain

137
00:05:06,216 --> 00:05:07,640
we're going to learn--

138
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,870
- We're going to get water!

139
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,740
- That's right.

140
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,306
We're gonna learn about the water cycle

141
00:05:11,306 --> 00:05:14,630
and what happens when rain forms.

142
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,340
Okay, so the first
thing that we need to do

143
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,120
so we need to take this
bottle and we're gonna

144
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,100
take the lid off of it.

145
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,210
Whoops.

146
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,550
And we're gonna put some
water inside of here.

147
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,420
- What about I hold it
and you put the water in?

148
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,720
- That's a great idea.

149
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,670
Let's go do that right now.

150
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,147
Okay, so we need some hot, hot water.

151
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:30,980
- Why?

152
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,910
- So this is on the hot setting, so just

153
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,040
be careful with your hands.

154
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,890
I'm gonna help you guide it in there.

155
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,481
You got it?

156
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:39,830
Okay, so we've got hot water.

157
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,680
Now on this part of the bottle,

158
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,480
we need to fill this with ice, okay?

159
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,373
Where do you think we can get some ice?

160
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,733
Yeah.

161
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:52,446
(cubes rattling)

162
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,500
- Okay, we got some ice.

163
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,550
Now, let's take this to the table.

164
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,760
Okay, so we've got our hot water here

165
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,500
and we've got our ice here.

166
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,197
- No, warm water.

167
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:07,060
- Oh, okay, it's warm water.

168
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,130
So what we're gonna do now--

169
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,403
- It turned into warm water.

170
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,670
- We're gonna put this on top of here.

171
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,740
Can you do that?

172
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,573
Don't dump it.

173
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:15,444
Just put it right on top.

174
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:17,920
Just like that, okay.

175
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,530
So what happens in the
world when we get rain

176
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,090
is the water in the oceans

177
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,050
and in the ground and in the lakes,

178
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,290
the sun beats on it
and it's nice and warm,

179
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,320
and then that water, right
here, turns into a gas

180
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,650
called water vapor.

181
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,352
- What's water vapor?

182
00:06:39,352 --> 00:06:41,260
- It's the gas form of water.

183
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,575
And then water vapor goes up into the sky

184
00:06:44,575 --> 00:06:47,280
and it stays there and then

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,910
it hangs out with all of
the other water vapors.

186
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,660
And there's all of this dust,
and all of these other things

187
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,493
up in the sky--

188
00:06:53,493 --> 00:06:54,880
- Into clouds!
- And they turn

189
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,110
into the clouds, that's exactly right.

190
00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:01,002
And it's cold up there
and because it's cold.

191
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:04,200
- Now it's cold out there.

192
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,610
- That's right and because
it's cold that water gets heavy

193
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,770
and the water vapor goes
from a gas back to a liquid.

194
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,170
And when that water gets
heavy enough in the clouds,

195
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,355
they drop.

196
00:07:17,355 --> 00:07:19,480
And what do you think that's called,

197
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,253
when water falls from the sky?

198
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
- Rainclouds.

199
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,280
- That's right. Rain.

200
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,454
- So what we have here is we
have warm water, or hot water,

201
00:07:29,454 --> 00:07:33,620
and that's gonna raise
up and evaporate in here.

202
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,120
- In the ice?

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,680
- Yup, and once it hits
the cold ice it's going

204
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,680
to gather up on the bottle
and it's going to condense

205
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:47,020
and there'll be condensation.

206
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,260
And once that condensation gets heavy,

207
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,380
it's going to fall down like
rain, back into the water.

208
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,600
So what we're gonna do
is we're gonna wait here

209
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,580
and let the water cycle happen

210
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,520
and we'll see if we can
see any rain come, kay?

211
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,541
Should we wait?

212
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,071
- Yeah.
- Okay.

213
00:08:02,071 --> 00:08:04,654
(bouncy music)

214
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:09,793
Come here Jackson!

215
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,374
Come here, bud.

216
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:16,580
Do you see the droplets on the cap?

217
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,413
- Yeah.

218
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:21,200
- All of that came and
that's how clouds rain.

219
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,642
Is the water heats up, turns into a gas,

220
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:28,612
gets cold again and mom's home!

221
00:08:28,612 --> 00:08:30,066
Hi guys.

222
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,710
- That looks cool.

223
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,150
- Look mom, it's raining.

224
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,640
Do you see all these water droplets?

225
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,472
- Yeah.

226
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:37,094
- That's where the rain comes
from once it's heavy enough.

227
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:40,381
Just like that, that's what rain is like.

228
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,609
Pretty cool, huh?

229
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,154
- Can I put my finger in it?

230
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,129
- Sure, it might be a little hot.

231
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:45,962
Is it hot?

232
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,030
- Oh yeah.

233
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,870
- Yeah.

234
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,680
Jackson, it's raining inside our house.

235
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,600
What are we doing?

236
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,150
This is, I knew we'd get rain in here

237
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,000
but I didn't think we'd get rain in here.

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,020
This is crazy.

239
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,750
I'm all wet.

240
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,905
Are you all wet?

241
00:08:57,905 --> 00:08:59,700
It's raining inside our house.

242
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,290
Is this crazy or what?

243
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,926
This science experiment
has gone a little too far.

244
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,093
- I think I'm gonna run away and run away.

245
00:09:06,093 --> 00:09:07,180
- Okay, let's run away.

246
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,745
Let's get out of here.

247
00:09:08,745 --> 00:09:10,841
(yelling)

248
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,220
Ah, It's raining everywhere, Jackson!

249
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,053
Are you dry?

250
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,872
Have you found a dry spot?

251
00:09:15,872 --> 00:09:18,470
- It's dry here in your office.

252
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,020
- Oh this is dry?

253
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,990
Oh my goodness.

254
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,533
- This is the dry place.

255
00:09:22,533 --> 00:09:25,783
- Thank goodness, I'm so
glad you found a dry place.

256
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:27,850
I can't believe it was
raining inside our house.

257
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,089
Luckily you found the
dry place, that's good.

258
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,930
Good, the sword is keeping
your hair dry, perfect.

259
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,410
Well I am so happy that it was

260
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:38,642
raining outside and not snowing outside.

261
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,460
I think spring is finally upon us.

262
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,310
But in Utah there is
always that one random snow

263
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,100
in the middle of May,
right around Mother's Day.

264
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,766
Right when you want to plant
flowers for your sweet mother

265
00:09:49,766 --> 00:09:54,270
we get one more snow and
it ruins all those flowers.

266
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:58,319
Calvin has been having
this strange thing that

267
00:09:58,319 --> 00:10:01,933
whenever we kiss him, he wipes it away.

268
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,893
Hey!

269
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:11,117
Why are you wiping it away?

270
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:13,732
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay.

271
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,460
Hey, why are you wiping it away?

272
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,953
That's my love that
I'm giving this to you.

273
00:10:21,518 --> 00:10:24,246
Let's see if we can sneak one on Calvin.

274
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,079
Oh!

275
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,143
Hey I thought I would get away with that.

276
00:10:33,143 --> 00:10:34,633
It's the funniest thing.

277
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,240
I've got your arms.

278
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,317
You can't wipe it away.

279
00:10:39,317 --> 00:10:41,760
And just like that the night is upon us

280
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,399
and everyone is already in bed.

281
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,647
And we are about to zonk out.

282
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:48,689
I wanted to say thank you guys.

283
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:53,151
So many of you have sent
me awesome recommendations

284
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:56,410
for experiments and
activities for me and the boys

285
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:58,292
to do together and I can't wait to do

286
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:01,420
more of those fun educational things.

287
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,720
So thank you guys for
sending me all of those.

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,910
But on that note, we are
going to end the vlog.

289
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,340
Thank you guys so much for watching.

290
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,920
If you enjoyed that experiment
that I did with Jackson

291
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,160
and kinda Calvin, give
the video a big thumbs up

292
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,966
and we will see you guys next time.

293
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,970
Side note, before it's actually over.

294
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,690
There wasn't actually rain in the house.

295
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,240
It's all special effects.

296
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,690
There was rain in the bottle though.

297
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,523
Kind of.

298
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:24,760
Condensation that dripped down.

299
00:11:24,760 --> 00:00:00,000
You know how it is.
