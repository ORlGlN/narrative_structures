1
00:00:00,163 --> 00:00:01,413
- It's snowing.

2
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:04,731
Did you see it Jax?

3
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,256
Look at how much snow we got.

4
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:08,872
Did you see it Jackson?

5
00:00:08,872 --> 00:00:11,039
(mumbles)

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:16,062
Did you see it?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:16,062 --> 00:00:18,155
- Look out there.

8
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:18,988
Holy cow.

9
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:22,919
Are we gonna play in it today?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,427
- We're gonna have a white Christmas.

11
00:00:25,427 --> 00:00:26,260
- Blue.

12
00:00:27,992 --> 00:00:29,585
- [Woman] What were you singing?

13
00:00:29,585 --> 00:00:32,668
- Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

14
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,584
- Just being himself.

15
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:40,084
Look at how much snow we have.

16
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:43,632
Oh my gosh.

17
00:00:46,225 --> 00:00:48,058
Look at all that snow.

18
00:00:49,709 --> 00:00:51,341
That's crazy.

19
00:00:51,341 --> 00:00:54,389
We're gonna have a white Christmas.

20
00:00:54,389 --> 00:00:57,472
(slow upbeat music)

21
00:00:59,785 --> 00:01:01,725
Alright, on this beautiful snow day

22
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,706
we are building and
organizing our puzzles.

23
00:01:04,706 --> 00:01:05,783
He doesn't know we're organizing.

24
00:01:05,783 --> 00:01:08,075
He thinks we're just building it.

25
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,183
We just built this one
and we put it in the baggy

26
00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:11,705
'cause that's one puzzle,

27
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:13,934
'cause all these puzzles were together.

28
00:01:13,934 --> 00:01:17,018
Now let's build this puzzle.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:20,354
- Okay, scoot back, we'll
build that together.

30
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:21,591
So we're gonna build this puzzle

31
00:01:21,591 --> 00:01:24,003
and once that's built and
we have all the pieces,

32
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,631
we'll put it in a bag.

33
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:30,020
What I want to do is get
like really small containers

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,120
rather than the bag, or actually,

35
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,732
probably a big container because I can

36
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:34,565
just leave these in bags

37
00:01:34,565 --> 00:01:36,201
and then put these in the container.

38
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:38,166
That way our puzzles are more organized

39
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,151
and they're not all mixed.

40
00:01:40,151 --> 00:01:43,508
This puzzle came in this
where it's like you have

41
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:45,443
a bunch of different
puzzles, but it's like

42
00:01:45,443 --> 00:01:47,973
what kid is gonna keep that organized.

43
00:01:47,973 --> 00:01:48,989
And that's just kind of
overwhelming for him.

44
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:51,444
- Look, they both match.

45
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,108
- Good job, let's keep going

46
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:55,153
and these are the perfect size puzzles.

47
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:56,381
This is great.

48
00:01:56,381 --> 00:02:00,327
Jackson loves puzzles
and he loves learning,

49
00:02:00,327 --> 00:02:01,859
and this has been so fun.

50
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:04,230
Calvin will come over here
once in awhile and help.

51
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,466
Calvin, what are you doing?

52
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:08,142
He's watching the snow fall guys.

53
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:09,603
It's beautiful out there.

54
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:11,768
Yup, that looks good.

55
00:02:11,768 --> 00:02:15,214
- It fits.
- That's the other puzzle.

56
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:17,275
Okay, let's find a bag.

57
00:02:17,275 --> 00:02:19,203
(laughing)

58
00:02:19,203 --> 00:02:20,155
The things kids say.

59
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:21,336
I don't even know if you can hear Jackson

60
00:02:21,336 --> 00:02:23,267
and I'm not gonna repeat it.

61
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:27,296
The holidays, where you
are cooking a lot more

62
00:02:27,296 --> 00:02:31,463
and you just want your
home to feel a certain way.

63
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:34,578
Julie called me and I called her

64
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:37,426
and I was like this stupid
jello, I did it wrong

65
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:40,154
and she's like my stupid
rolls, it's all sticky.

66
00:02:40,154 --> 00:02:43,354
So she's having issues, I'm having issues.

67
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:46,032
Though I will say my rolls are looking

68
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,449
pretty dang good.

69
00:02:48,442 --> 00:02:50,407
Julie made this the
other day at the party.

70
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:53,008
It's pretzels with butter over it

71
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:55,411
that you cook for 10
minutes to harden it up

72
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:59,253
and then whipped cream and
cream cheese spread over the top

73
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:01,276
and then you refrigerate
it and then you put jello

74
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,686
over the top with some like
strawberries or raspberries

75
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:07,037
and it's a really, really good dessert.

76
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:09,007
So I'm making it right now.

77
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:10,269
This is the second time I've made it

78
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:13,050
because earlier I forgot
to do the whipped cream

79
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,800
and it was just cream
cheese and it was like

80
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,033
oh I didn't write the instructions.

81
00:03:17,033 --> 00:03:20,307
So that's what I'm doing right now.

82
00:03:20,307 --> 00:03:23,420
Guys, it's snowing and the
kids and I went into town.

83
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,031
I had a lunch date with them.

84
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:27,046
Jarred's finishing up work.

85
00:03:27,046 --> 00:03:28,646
And it's gonna feel like the holidays

86
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:32,005
in about 20 minutes
because Jarred will be done

87
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:35,184
and we will play and eat (screaming).

88
00:03:35,184 --> 00:03:36,324
Merry Christmas.

89
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:39,452
- Okay, we are doing some
major holiday preparation.

90
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,717
I have edited two vlogs this morning,

91
00:03:41,717 --> 00:03:43,877
uploaded two vlogs today.

92
00:03:43,877 --> 00:03:46,593
I have edited two more vlogs

93
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:50,959
and I'm rendering out
an animation right now

94
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,520
for the end of our Christmas special

95
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,152
that is going up on Christmas day,

96
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,077
so you've already seen it.

97
00:03:57,077 --> 00:03:58,255
So you've already seen the animation,

98
00:03:58,255 --> 00:04:01,653
but I'm doing it right now
and it is like three o'clock

99
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:02,509
in the afternoon.

100
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,010
I have been in my office
since seven this morning

101
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,063
and it is time to get out to the snow.

102
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,965
It has been snowing all day today.

103
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,544
We have like an additional foot of snow

104
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,946
and I cannot wait to get
outside and play with it.

105
00:04:13,946 --> 00:04:16,421
I had a little tease of
myself because I went outside

106
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,495
and I plowed the driveway
with the four wheeler.

107
00:04:18,495 --> 00:04:21,963
Can I just tell ya like I
love having to plow, Ellie.

108
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,530
Like I freaking love it.

109
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,963
- You were cute outside.

110
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,339
Jarred went in his office and worked

111
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:28,250
and then I hear the four
wheeler and I was like,

112
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,430
is Joel here?

113
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,978
And I look outside and Jarred's plowing.

114
00:04:31,978 --> 00:04:32,917
(mumbles)

115
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,916
I was like oh my gosh,
he's outside like plowing.

116
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,869
- Yeah, it's so fun like because

117
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:40,487
there's just so much power behind it.

118
00:04:40,487 --> 00:04:42,993
Oh man, I can't wait
to get out in the snow.

119
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:43,911
Ellie, I think what we should do,

120
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:46,358
so my brother Ryan is in
town and he brought his girl

121
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:49,753
and his wife, Maria, and
I think what we should do

122
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,176
is we should get the orange sled

123
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:53,358
and tie it to the four
wheeler and pull the kids

124
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:54,616
around on it.

125
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:55,616
Doesn't that sound like a blast?

126
00:04:55,616 --> 00:04:57,057
- Do you have a rope that the kids?

127
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,717
Got it.
- Yes.

128
00:04:58,717 --> 00:04:59,733
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

129
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,377
This is what I love about the wintertime.

130
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:04,739
I'm gonna be the first one down the slide.

131
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,327
I'm gonna be the first one down the slide.

132
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:07,234
You ready, Penny?

133
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:08,245
You ready, let's go.

134
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:09,505
Come on let's go.

135
00:05:09,505 --> 00:05:11,413
Oh my gosh, there's so much snow.

136
00:05:11,413 --> 00:05:13,849
(laughing)

137
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:15,649
Oh, do you remember when
you were just a puppy

138
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,889
and you would go in the snow

139
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,643
and it would just completely
cover you last year?

140
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:21,476
That was awesome.

141
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:24,383
(squeaking)

142
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:26,229
Oh yeah, is that so?

143
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:27,062
Ready, ready?

144
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:28,819
(growling)

145
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:30,819
Your grip is too strong.

146
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:36,119
A fresh slide just
waiting for me to go down.

147
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:37,772
(screaming)

148
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:40,022
(laughing)

149
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:45,018
Is it still good?

150
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:47,361
It's our last camera.

151
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:50,359
I should have brought the GoPro.

152
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:51,851
That's my hat Penny.

153
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,101
(laughing)

154
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,497
Okay, well that may have been
the last part of this camera

155
00:05:58,497 --> 00:05:59,562
so I'm gonna hand it over to you

156
00:05:59,562 --> 00:06:00,499
so it has safekeeping.

157
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:03,367
- We'll have fun, you just know that.

158
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,367
(slow upbeat music)

159
00:06:10,756 --> 00:06:13,032
- [Ellie] Look at Calvin
trying to get up those steps.

160
00:06:13,032 --> 00:06:14,651
There's so much snow.

161
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:17,151
Hey Jackson, Jackson, Jackson.

162
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:20,112
Why are you holding onto your gloves?

163
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:22,202
- Because Penny can't get them.

164
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:23,506
- [Ellie] Good job.

165
00:06:23,506 --> 00:06:24,922
That's the rule huh?

166
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:27,813
Hold on to your gloves
so Penny doesn't get 'em.

167
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:30,813
(slow upbeat music)

168
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:35,829
- [Jarred] Oh my goodness,
we're tredging through

169
00:06:35,829 --> 00:06:37,757
such deep snow.

170
00:06:37,757 --> 00:06:40,253
It's all the way up to your knees.

171
00:06:40,253 --> 00:06:42,111
It's like past my boots.

172
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:43,194
That's crazy.

173
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,390
- Like a robot.

174
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,601
- [Jarred] Yes, you do look like a robot.

175
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:48,191
You're exactly right, Jackson.

176
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:50,572
Alright buddy, I've got
it all set up for you.

177
00:06:50,572 --> 00:06:51,631
Are you excited?

178
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:53,026
- There's no room for me.

179
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:55,488
- [Jarred] Sure there
is, right in between.

180
00:06:55,488 --> 00:06:56,399
You sit right there.

181
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,015
We've got a sled.

182
00:06:58,015 --> 00:06:59,803
We've got a four wheeler.

183
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:00,804
You ready to rock?

184
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:01,793
- [Together] Yes.

185
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:03,426
- Let's have some fun.

186
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:06,426
(slow upbeat music)

187
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:16,540
(laughing)

188
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,759
Whoa.

189
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,176
You guys crashed.

190
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:22,715
Why'd you crash?

191
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:24,232
(laughing)

192
00:07:24,232 --> 00:07:27,315
Hey, hop back in and we'll get going.

193
00:07:29,762 --> 00:07:31,218
Okay, you ready?

194
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:34,218
(slow upbeat music)

195
00:07:39,316 --> 00:07:40,149
Hey.

196
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:46,974
Whoa.

197
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,018
(laughing)

198
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:53,446
Hey, Buzz Light year.

199
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:54,743
Hey, you kids.

200
00:07:54,743 --> 00:07:57,434
Did you have fun on the
four wheeler, on the sled?

201
00:07:57,434 --> 00:07:58,407
- Yeah.

202
00:07:58,407 --> 00:07:59,745
- That was so much fun, huh?

203
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:01,364
Well, I've got a great idea,

204
00:08:01,364 --> 00:08:04,320
something that we can do
before bedtime tonight.

205
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,799
I think we should call
Santa Claus on the phone.

206
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,927
Should we call Santa Claus on the phone?

207
00:08:10,927 --> 00:08:11,760
- Yeah.

208
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,593
- [Ellie] And see if he answers.

209
00:08:12,593 --> 00:08:13,841
- Should we do that?
- Um-hum.

210
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:14,716
- Okay, ready?

211
00:08:14,716 --> 00:08:15,633
Let's come over here.

212
00:08:15,633 --> 00:08:17,892
We'll put it on speakerphone
so we can all hear.

213
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:18,892
Okay, ready?

214
00:08:20,777 --> 00:08:23,277
Okay Google, call Santa Claus.

215
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,064
(beeping)

216
00:08:27,064 --> 00:08:28,862
- [Man] Hello there,
North Pole switchboard.

217
00:08:28,862 --> 00:08:31,148
My name is Gumdrop,
connecting you to Santa

218
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:32,645
in the recording studio.

219
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:34,170
Just a sec.

220
00:08:34,171 --> 00:08:36,085
- Do you hear that?

221
00:08:36,085 --> 00:08:37,618
We're on hold with Santa Claus.

222
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:39,265
- [Man] Santa, telephone.

223
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,166
- [Santa] A phone call well (laughing).

224
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,699
Hello, you caught me taking a little break

225
00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:46,745
from my nice list work to get ready

226
00:08:46,745 --> 00:08:49,093
for the big elf stock show.

227
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:53,267
You know, since you are
already on the nice list,

228
00:08:53,267 --> 00:08:54,981
maybe you could help me out.

229
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,248
So, what do you say, do
you wanna help me out?

230
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,274
- [Ellie] Can we help him?

231
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,868
- [Together] Yeah.

232
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:02,901
- [Santa] I have a few questions for you.

233
00:09:02,901 --> 00:09:04,832
Do you like music that
makes you jump around

234
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:06,088
like a monkey?

235
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,255
- Yeah.
- Yes.

236
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,900
(laughing)

237
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,876
- [Santa] That's a fun way to get exercise

238
00:09:11,876 --> 00:09:16,043
like after you eat 100,000
cookies in one night and candy.

239
00:09:16,976 --> 00:09:19,636
- [Man] Whoa Santa, I just
had the strangest dream.

240
00:09:19,636 --> 00:09:22,361
- [Santa] Please grab that thing.

241
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:23,300
- [Man] It's a key tar.

242
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,782
- [Santa] What is a key tar?

243
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:29,398
I think our caller wants
to hear Claus and effect.

244
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:30,886
- [Man] Wow, guess I wasn't dreaming.

245
00:09:30,886 --> 00:09:32,685
- [Santa] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

246
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:34,603
♪ Jingle bells dance more swells ♪

247
00:09:34,603 --> 00:09:36,690

♪ Up, up, up in the club ♪

252
00:09:46,554 --> 00:09:47,896
- [Jarred] Do it again Cal.

253
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,834
- [Santa] Ho, ho, ho hurray.

254
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:51,895
- [Jarred] Yeah, goodbye.

255
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:52,728
- Bye.

256
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:55,468
- [Santa] Okay, we'll start over.

257
00:09:55,468 --> 00:09:56,885
- [Together] Bye.

258
00:09:58,284 --> 00:09:59,450
- That is so cool.

259
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:02,500
- We just called Santa Claus.

260
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,630
- [Ellie] What did you think of him?

261
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,064
- Good.
- It was fun, huh?

262
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,987
He sang us a song and we danced.

263
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:11,070
- [Ellie] And boom, look at the baby.

264
00:10:13,274 --> 00:10:14,585
(mumbles)

265
00:10:14,585 --> 00:10:15,502
Oh my gosh.

266
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,562
That's a good little bump.

267
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,660
It's a good little bump mister.

268
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,698
- It's a bump.
- It's a bump.

269
00:10:23,698 --> 00:10:25,382
I went to take a picture of my bump

270
00:10:25,382 --> 00:10:28,292
and Jackson came running up
to me and lifted up my shirt

271
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:30,891
and was looking at my stomach.

272
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,862
Oh my goodness, I can't go anywhere.

273
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:34,498
Calvin.

274
00:10:34,498 --> 00:10:36,423
(screaming)

275
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,049
Mister, I almost stepped on you.

276
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:39,628
- Alright, listen up kiddos.

277
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:40,629
Here's what we're gonna do.

278
00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:41,805
Come circle around me.

279
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,553
I have two arms and I need my children

280
00:10:43,553 --> 00:10:44,773
to be in them.

281
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:49,111
Tomorrow is Christmas
Eve and we have not seen

282
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:53,694
enough Christmas movies, so
we are going to go downstairs

283
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:56,030
and we are going to sit
together as a family,

284
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,704
maybe have some popcorn
and maybe have some treats,

285
00:10:58,704 --> 00:10:59,551
I don't know.

286
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:00,728
We'll just see where the night takes us.

287
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,616
Yeah treats, and we're gonna watch--

288
00:11:02,616 --> 00:11:04,823
- Popcorn and candy canes.

289
00:11:04,823 --> 00:11:06,155
- Oh, that sounds nice.

290
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:08,246
We're gonna watch a Christmas movie

291
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:09,451
and we'll get to the presents later.

292
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:11,726
I know you're very excited
about the presents.

293
00:11:11,726 --> 00:11:14,379
We'll get the Christmas
presents in a little bit.

294
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,763
- [Ellie] Okay, I'll get
the snacks so you guys

295
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:17,875
go lay a blanket out.

296
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,292
(slow music)

297
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:24,617
- You were spilling.

298
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,342
(laughing)

299
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:27,388
Mom, you were spilling.

300
00:11:27,388 --> 00:11:29,841
- So much for trying to get (mumbles).

301
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:30,782
- [Ellie] We're spilling.

302
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:32,872
- Mom's spilling everywhere.

303
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:35,960
We got M and Ms, we got
popcorn, we got chocolate milk

304
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,793
for the kiddos.

305
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:38,388
- We got a baby bump.

306
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,342
- Oh, your baby bump is so cute.

307
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:41,428
When we were on the phone with Santa Claus

308
00:11:41,428 --> 00:11:43,314
I saw your baby bump and I was like

309
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:45,180
that's our little baby.

310
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,513
That's so sweet.

311
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:49,433
- I'm feeling really good.
- Good.

312
00:11:49,433 --> 00:11:51,479
You're looking really good.

313
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,812
- I am situated.

314
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,513
The baby's comfy.

315
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,174
The kids are comfy.

316
00:12:00,787 --> 00:12:02,870
Jackson chose The Grinch.

317
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,934
- Now I'm comfy.

318
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,639
- Do you feel just like (sighs).

319
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,018
- Yeah.
- It feels good just to--

320
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:11,714
- Well honestly, I have a
feeling I might fall asleep

321
00:12:11,714 --> 00:12:13,654
watching this movie.
- It's okay.

322
00:12:13,654 --> 00:12:16,473
- It's just nice to sit
and kick your feet up.

323
00:12:16,473 --> 00:12:18,079
- And cuddle.

324
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,415
I cannot even believe this tonight.

325
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:23,036
- Look at your belly.
- I was taking picture of it

326
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:26,742
and I took a picture of it like this

327
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:28,967
and I was like that's not a good angle.

328
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:30,706
It was just like everything.

329
00:12:30,706 --> 00:12:32,131
- I like angle a lot.

330
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,165
- I'll start the angle this way.

331
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,280
That looks better.
- There you go.

332
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,614
Hi baby.

333
00:12:37,614 --> 00:12:39,715
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yeah.

334
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:41,582
Ellie, this is our little baby boy.

335
00:12:41,582 --> 00:12:43,302
- Oh my gosh.
- How sweet.

336
00:12:43,302 --> 00:12:46,370
- Mister.
- Merry Christmas baby boy.

337
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,821
- Oh, oh, it just kicked
- He's a soccer player.

338
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:51,305
- Next Christmas he
will be six months old.

339
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:53,937
- That's crazy.
- Crazy.

340
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:55,337
Watch The Grinch.

341
00:12:55,337 --> 00:12:56,420
- The Grinch.

342
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:00,975
- [Ellie] That seems like it'll do ya.

343
00:13:00,975 --> 00:13:03,238
- Dropping a package my dear.

344
00:13:03,238 --> 00:13:04,071
Packages.

345
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:09,046
- [Ellie] Are you gonna
sit down and eat it?

346
00:13:09,046 --> 00:13:09,879
- [Jarred] Can I borrow your finger?

347
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:12,962
- Can I use your finger for a second?

348
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:15,132
- Hi.

349
00:13:15,132 --> 00:13:16,654
- I was gonna scare
you, but then I thought

350
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:19,503
I probably shouldn't
scare a pregnant lady.

351
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:20,883
I was gonna say--

352
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,139
- [Ellie] I might cry.

353
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,316
- I was gonna say, how do you
wanna end the blog tonight?

354
00:13:26,316 --> 00:13:28,066
- I would have cried.

355
00:13:29,007 --> 00:13:31,237
- And beat me to a bloody pulp.

356
00:13:31,237 --> 00:13:33,394
Anyway, with that being said,

357
00:13:33,394 --> 00:13:34,526
we had a wonderful evening.

358
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:36,005
We got the kids to bed and we did

359
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,912
some great Christmas preparation stuff

360
00:13:38,912 --> 00:13:41,836
and we're very excited
about Christmas and--

361
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:43,651
- Our kids.
- The kids, yeah.

362
00:13:43,651 --> 00:13:44,754
It's gonna be really great.

363
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:45,737
- Makes me excited.

364
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:49,359
I'm like just as excited
for them as they're excited.

365
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,218
- I know.

366
00:13:50,218 --> 00:13:51,869
I was like that's the
thing about being a parent

367
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:55,029
during Christmas is you're
more excited about your kids

368
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:57,564
being excited than anything else

369
00:13:57,564 --> 00:13:59,012
and that's the cool part about it.

370
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:00,429
So with that being said,

371
00:14:00,429 --> 00:14:01,478
we are going to call it a night.

372
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:02,552
Thank you so much for watching.

373
00:14:02,552 --> 00:14:04,562
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up

374
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,822
and we will see you guys tomorrow

375
00:14:06,822 --> 00:14:10,287
where it is almost a brand new year.

376
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:12,370
2018 baby, it's our year.

377
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,255
Sorry, year.

378
00:14:15,237 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
