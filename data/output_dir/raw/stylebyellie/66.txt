1
00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:01,156
(jack-in-the-box pops)

2
00:00:01,156 --> 00:00:02,000
- Aay!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,780
- Oh my gosh, is everything on fire,

4
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:04,720
is everything good?

5
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,475
- [Ellie] You can't walk anymore?

6
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:07,980
- No I'm tired.

7
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,860
- You and I personally
haven't really talked

8
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:10,940
about it that much,

9
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:12,098
is this right here.

10
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:14,765
(playful music)

11
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,655
(bell dings)

12
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:34,197
- [Ellie] Why are you so cute?

13
00:00:34,197 --> 00:00:35,679
- Because I am.

14
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:36,676
- [Ellie] You just are?

15
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:37,509
- Uh-huh.

16
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:43,407
(jack-in-the-box pops)

17
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:44,240
- Aay!

18
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,900
- We are back from church

19
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,850
and it is finally time
for me to try the roast

20
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,180
that Ellie has been raving
about for three days straight.

21
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,013
- I saved a little bit,

22
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:56,058
so it's the last day.

23
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:57,440
I hope you like it.

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,370
- Well I'm sure I will,

25
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,034
but I don't think you went into detail

26
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:01,860
about the first roast that you made

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,920
that turned out so bad.

28
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,373
- Oh we've talked about that before.

29
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:05,206
- We've talked about it,

30
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:06,628
I'll do a quick little summary.

31
00:01:06,628 --> 00:01:09,340
It was one of the first
months that we were married,

32
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,660
maybe even the first week.

33
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,620
- Oh I think it was within the month

34
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:13,453
we were married.

35
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:14,286
- Yeah.

36
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:16,420
We had the Crockpot out,

37
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,823
or not even the Crockpot, it was the--

38
00:01:17,823 --> 00:01:18,656
- [Ellie] It was in the oven.

39
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:19,670
- The Corelle oven,

40
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,250
and we had a roast in there

41
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,604
and then we set it for a bunch of time,

42
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,020
just like you normally would,

43
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,870
we went to church

44
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,480
and when we came home, we smelled smoke.

45
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,600
It just smelled so burnt.

46
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,510
Then we went inside

47
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,343
and we were like oh my gosh,

48
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:33,550
is everything on fire?

49
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,670
Is everything good?

50
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,650
Nothing was on fire.

51
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:36,600
We looked in the oven,

52
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,500
it was still cooking,

53
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,600
we pulled it out,

54
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,110
sure enough, burnt to a crisp.

55
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,712
Even the carrots were burnt to a crisp.

56
00:01:44,712 --> 00:01:47,266
- Yeah I set it three settings too high.

57
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,099
- Yeah.

58
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:49,110
So what we had found out

59
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,750
was that Ellie actually turned it

60
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,090
100 degrees higher than
it was supposed to,

61
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,610
but that was a funny
first marriage experience

62
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,070
that we will never ever forget.

63
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,730
And it's important to have those Ellie.

64
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,830
It's important to have moments

65
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,340
where you can look back at yourself

66
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,420
and laugh and compare.

67
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,546
- And that was the first time Jared ever--

68
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,913
I was like aw, eff, son of a.

69
00:02:09,913 --> 00:02:10,953
(Jared laughs)

70
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:11,786
I was pissed.

71
00:02:11,786 --> 00:02:13,100
- She was so upset.

72
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,360
But now that we have this,

73
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,220
it's just we can look back and laugh on it

74
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,530
and it's a funny experience

75
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,757
and that's how life is.
- Totally.

76
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:21,240
- It's important to have those moments

77
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,560
where you're having a hard time,

78
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,540
but then you can look
back and laugh on it.

79
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,070
And here we go.

80
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:30,374
Mmm mmm mmm mmm,

81
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,961
that's a good roast Ellie, good job.

82
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:34,794
- Was it?

83
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:35,627
Is it?
- No yeah.

84
00:02:35,627 --> 00:02:36,460
- Or are you just saying that?

85
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,293
- No it's so good,

86
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:38,340
it's stinkin' good.

87
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,730
- Like the best I've ever made?

88
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,350
- Yeah definitely up there with the best

89
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:43,183
that you've made.

90
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:45,100
Probably the best, but
definitely up there.

91
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,480
- Oh my heck,

92
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,220
I think it's the best that I ever made.

93
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,130
And I didn't do anything different,

94
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,332
I just put it in the Crockpot

95
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,858
for four and a half hours.

96
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:55,131
- Hey wait!

97
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:55,964
Hey wait!

98
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,706
- [Jared] These kids are playin'.

99
00:02:57,706 --> 00:02:58,599
- Coming back to the starting line.

100
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,401
- [Jared] Go back to the starting line.

101
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,168
- [Both] Bee!

102
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,130
(Jared laughs)

103
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,420
- [Jared] I have no idea
what they're playing,

104
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,870
but they're playing together.

105
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:09,590
Oh you went past the starting line,

106
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,170
you gotta go back and wait for him.

107
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:14,140
Calvin you give him the cue when to go.

108
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,883
- [Ellie] Okay one two three.

109
00:03:15,883 --> 00:03:16,891
- [Both] Bee!

110
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:17,786
(Jared laughs)

111
00:03:17,786 --> 00:03:20,420
- We are out in the sun.

112
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,600
It feels so good.
(dreamy guitar music)

113
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,610
It's January and it feels so good.

114
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,540
We're taking Penny on a little Sunday walk

115
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,740
in the mountains.

116
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,280
This is our second route,

117
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,040
the first one was a little too cold.

118
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,140
Mister, what's wrong?

119
00:03:33,706 --> 00:03:35,550
- I can't move.

120
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,279
- [Ellie] You can't walk anymore?

121
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,880
- No I'm tired.

122
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,420
- [Ellie] Aww dangit.

123
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,025
I think we're almost done, okay?

124
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:45,420
♪ In circles prance along the ground ♪

125
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,520
We just got done seeing
the cutest little puppy,

126
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,070
our neighbor's little puppy.

127
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,237
And I forgot how, Penny is
still in the puppy stage,

128
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,850
'cause she's a year old,
but that new puppy stage

129
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,600
where they jump on the
kid, knock him over,

130
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,540
kinda maul their face a little.

131
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,850
You know, Penny doesn't
knock the kids over

132
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,250
and then continue to be
around 'em, you know?

133
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,440
It's usually an accident,

134
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,370
by her running too fast or something.

135
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,290
So we left that little
puppy and I was like,

136
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,640
I'm really grateful we're in the stage

137
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,310
of life we're in, just all around.

138
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,970
So cute puppy, but puppies, ah!

139
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,803
What?

140
00:04:25,688 --> 00:04:26,910
- Come.

141
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,241
- [Ellie] You want me to hold your hand?

142
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:29,074
- Yeah.

143
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,710
- [Ellie] I love it
when Penny finds friends

144
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,900
and when the friends are friendly.

145
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,630
That's a big dog.

146
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,340
Look how big that dog is.

147
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,560
Come on Jackson?

148
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,060
You want me to hold your hand?

149
00:04:46,455 --> 00:04:47,620
Wow.

150
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,210
- [Jared] How fun is that?

151
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,980
- [Ellie] I always wanted to ice fish.

152
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,046
- [Jared] I know that's like--

153
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:53,847
- [Ellie] Some day.

154
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:54,680
It'll be on our list.

155
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,800
- Bucket list.

156
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,700
- Yeah, I've always wanted to ice fish.

157
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,500
We are listening to the soundtrack

158
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,970
of the Great Showman.

159
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,700
It is amazing.

160
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,750
The kids are asleep,
we're on a Sunday drive.

161
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,873
Just driving around, looking
at the beauty of Utah.

162
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:13,540
♪ Beside me and never leave ♪

163
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,550
- One thing that we failed to talk about

164
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,550
and you and I personally
haven't really talked

165
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,800
about it that much,

166
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,560
is this right here.

167
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,190
You had an ultrasound while I was gone--

168
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,410
- [Ellie] I did.

169
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,820
- and we have some pictures
of our baby little boy.

170
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,100
- And he is so cute.

171
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,933
- [Jared] Tell me about it,

172
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:34,640
because you haven't
really told me about it,

173
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,473
going through it.

174
00:05:35,473 --> 00:05:37,450
- Well I did film it on my phone.

175
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,760
It was a really quick one,

176
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,730
like I wasn't scheduled for one,

177
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,220
but my doctor's really good.

178
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,700
And he knows I've been having nerves,

179
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,450
so he did it really quick.

180
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,283
It's hard to see,

181
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:49,810
because I think he was
flipped a certain way,

182
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,521
because it was hard to see his face.

183
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,354
- [Jared] Yeah.

184
00:05:52,354 --> 00:05:53,187
- [Ellie] But he is a boy.

185
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,020
(Jared laughs)

186
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,252
He is wiggling, I saw his
little hands by his face.

187
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:57,085
- [Jared] Awww.

188
00:05:57,085 --> 00:05:58,450
- The first thing I saw was this

189
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,210
and I was like oh my gosh.

190
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,210
- [Jared] How sweet.

191
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,377
- And his profile looks
exactly like the others.

192
00:06:09,031 --> 00:06:09,864
- [Jared] Yeah.

193
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:12,234
- [Ellie] Look at his profile.

194
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:14,640
This ultrasound picture

195
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,700
looks so much like the others.

196
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,490
- [Jared] It almost looks
like he has a helmet on,

197
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,598
like a football helmet.

198
00:06:20,598 --> 00:06:22,830
- Well look at his nose and his mouth

199
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,180
and how it kinda protrudes out,

200
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,710
like his eyes, it goes in.

201
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,440
and then it sticks out right here.

202
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
- [Jared] It's just cute.

203
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,300
- That's totally how
Calvin and Jackson looked,

204
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,380
it's gonna be so fun
to see this little guy.

205
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,760
- Yeah, and I love that you can see more

206
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,016
as time goes on, like at
the 20 week ultrasound-

207
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:39,849
- [Ellie] Yes.

208
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:41,030
- And then on after, how fun.
- Hopefully, we'll get better.

209
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,590
- Yeah we totally will.

210
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,850
We haven't had a good 3D ultrasound

211
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:46,737
with any of our kids.

212
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:47,570
- [Ellie] No.

213
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,510
- I think we did it with Calvin

214
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,270
and it didn't work out,

215
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,560
his hands were in front of his face,

216
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,155
so it didn't work out
as the way we wanted.

217
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:55,350
- Maybe this time we can get one.

218
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:58,440
- Yeah, I just love that you went in

219
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,638
for an ultrasound and got this.

220
00:07:01,638 --> 00:07:02,650
- So sweet, I'll keep it forever.

221
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,830
- [Jared] Little heartbeat, I know.

222
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,660
- I am 16 weeks this week

223
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,910
and it has flown by.

224
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,380
Jared, I asked if he was able to at CES,

225
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,410
to look at some of the
baby electronics stuff.

226
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,380
And he said he wasn't
able to get to that area,

227
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,230
but hopefully, I think
there's something in the works

228
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,370
with me going somewhere
really cool with Jared

229
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,170
and it's kind of like the same thing

230
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,660
as electronics, but it's for babies,

231
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,260
so if that pans out, hopefully I can find

232
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,840
some really fun bassinet,
or just some fun baby stuff

233
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,055
that's new, just electronic stuff.

234
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:41,660
That would be cool, huh?

235
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,041
- Oh yeah.
- For me.

236
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,840
- And for you, like baby.
- Yeah.

237
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,320
- Well and I really wanted
to try and get over there,

238
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,440
but I found out that it
was in the Sands Expo Hall,

239
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,610
which was not in the same
convention center area.

240
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,443
- [Ellie] That's a bummer.

241
00:07:53,443 --> 00:07:54,860
- Yeah, so I was really bummed.

242
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,890
- Hopefully this works out.

243
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,223
Did you bring your loot up?

244
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,056
- Uh-huh.
(playful guitar music)

245
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:00,530
- [Ellie] Wow, what are
you guys gonna build?

246
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,540
- [Jackson] A garage.

247
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,540
- [Ellie] Wow, I heard all the ruckus.

248
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,440
You grabbed everything, piled it up

249
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,830
and brought it up here.

250
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:09,627
- Wow.

251
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:10,460
- [Ellie] Wow.

252
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,265
- Can you make it for me please?

253
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:13,334
- [Ellie] I can help you.

254
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,667
- I want this to be the top.

255
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,760
- [Ellie] Okay, now put the top on top

256
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,150
and we'll finish it off.

257
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,600
Back here.

258
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,460
Perfect.

259
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,150
Some of it will be a covered garage

260
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:27,700
and then you'll have
space to drive into it.

261
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,270
Like the garage doors.

262
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,103
- Cool.

263
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,827
- [Ellie] Did I just blow your mind?

264
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:33,659
(Ellie laughs)

265
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,492
- Mom, here top!

266
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,095
- [Ellie] You got the top?

267
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,196
- Yeah.

268
00:08:37,196 --> 00:08:38,429
- This is the top.

269
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,769
- [Ellie] Let him put a few on,

270
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,549
to make him feel like he's helping.

271
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:43,199
Woo, that's cool.

272
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,121
Okay, put your cars in.

273
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:46,815
- I want this with the red one.

274
00:08:46,815 --> 00:08:47,775
(beeping)

275
00:08:47,775 --> 00:08:48,608
- Chase?

276
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:50,684
Where's Chase?

277
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,660
- [Ellie] Where'd your Chase go?

278
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,120
Say goodnight to Chase.

279
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:57,501
- Goodnight Chase.

280
00:08:57,501 --> 00:08:58,370
Gone.

281
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:00,480
- [Jackson] He's right here in the wagon.

282
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,259
- [Ellie] Did you put him in there?

283
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,520
- Goodnight cars.

284
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,170
- [Ellie] See you in the morning.

285
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,595
- Goodnight Chase.

286
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:10,744
- Calvin, he can go night night in here.

287
00:09:10,744 --> 00:09:13,150
- No, night night is top.

288
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:14,750
- [Ellie] He wants to put him in the house

289
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,670
or on top like a guard dog

290
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,643
like (gasps) Rock Dog?

291
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:19,476
- Yeah.

292
00:09:19,476 --> 00:09:20,320
- [Ellie] You know how
Rock Dog watches out?

293
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,988
Maybe Chase will watch out.

294
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:26,571
(high pitched verbalizing)

295
00:09:27,415 --> 00:09:28,870
He's talking so high.

296
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,530
Calvin, what color is this one?

297
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,845
What color is that?

298
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:35,678
- Red.

299
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,580
- [Ellie] Red, what color is this?

300
00:09:38,542 --> 00:09:39,375
- Blue.

301
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,554
- [Ellie] What one's blue?

302
00:09:43,554 --> 00:09:44,542
- This one.

303
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,730
- [Ellie] What one's green?

304
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,563
- This one.

305
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:47,790
- [Ellie] What color is this?

306
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,330
- Blue.

307
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,650
- [Ellie] Green.

308
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,876
Say goodnight.

309
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:53,709
- Goodnight.
(crashing)

310
00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:54,684
- [Ellie] Night.

311
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:55,517
(Jackson mock crying)

312
00:09:55,517 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh no.

313
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:01,762
(mock crying)

314
00:10:01,762 --> 00:10:04,000
- My garage is open!

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,570
- [Ellie] It's over.

316
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,060
You broke it.

317
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,560
Here, I have an idea.

318
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,320
Let's see who's fastest at putting them

319
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,470
all in the bucket.

320
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,310
Pick 'em up, pick 'em
up, as fast as you can.

321
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,330
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

322
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,360
Calvin you're slow, stop break dancing.

323
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,556
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

324
00:10:19,556 --> 00:10:21,230
Can you put the cars in?

325
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,460
Go put Chase to bed.

326
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,110
- Well guys that is a wrap on the day.

327
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,410
Thank you so much for watching.

328
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,420
I am so glad to be home with my family.

329
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,340
We had such a great weekend together.

330
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,410
Thank you guys so much for watching.

331
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,220
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up

332
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,830
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

333
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,750
Bye.

334
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,583
The Beatles.
