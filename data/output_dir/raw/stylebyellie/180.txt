1
00:00:00,388 --> 00:00:01,890
- [Dad] The hardest thing
about it, there's not much

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,973
you can do or say to change anything.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:11,911
Knowing that some people can
benefit from our experience

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,828
I think helps us go through it too.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:20,791
- I'm sitting here waiting
for everybody to get home

6
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:25,461
from church and I've kind
of been taken back with how

7
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,291
I have been feeling physically.

8
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,905
My doctor told me that
every two to three hours

9
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:34,108
I need to get up and walk around.

10
00:00:34,108 --> 00:00:37,370
I'm not one to lay in bed
even if I can and so I have

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:41,340
gotten up several times
because I feel good and then

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,051
I'm like "yup I need to
lay down, I need to lay

13
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:46,360
"down right now," and I
had a lot of cramping today

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,031
and so I've been trying to take it easy.

15
00:00:49,031 --> 00:00:52,371
I did get up once back up
for a long time and then I've

16
00:00:52,371 --> 00:00:55,684
been laying down the rest
of the day and I'm just

17
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:58,954
surprised I didn't realize
how much it would take a toll

18
00:00:58,954 --> 00:01:01,971
on me not only emotionally but physically.

19
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:04,568
But I'm ready for my family
to be home from church.

20
00:01:04,568 --> 00:01:08,399
I miss them, they've only
been gone a few hours

21
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,029
but I looked in the mirror
and I look really pale

22
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:14,850
and I kinda have a raspy
voice so I think I need to

23
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,360
get some food in me, some water,
and rest a little bit more.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,365
- We just got back from church and I am

25
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,032
making dinner today.

26
00:01:23,356 --> 00:01:25,881
I'm making like a hardy
chili for Ellie and right now

27
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:28,329
I'm watching it sizzle
and I'm making it curl

28
00:01:28,329 --> 00:01:30,162
with these vegetables.

29
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:35,586
(Jeopardy music)

30
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:39,753
One delicious hardy chili meal check.

31
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:43,101
One sweet sweet mamma who may
have overdone it yesterday.

32
00:01:43,101 --> 00:01:45,738
- Thank you, I don't feel
like I overdid it yesterday.

33
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:47,746
I think it was this morning.

34
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:50,323
- [Dad] It was this morning you did it?

35
00:01:50,323 --> 00:01:53,393
Okay well either way, I
made you this meal full

36
00:01:53,393 --> 00:01:56,406
of nutrients, health,
protein and energy for you.

37
00:01:56,406 --> 00:01:58,085
- Thank you.

38
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,565
- Can I have some marshmallows?

39
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:03,065
- You can have some of those marshmallows.

40
00:02:04,197 --> 00:02:05,530
It's sour cream.

41
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:10,051
These are healthy marshmallows.

42
00:02:10,051 --> 00:02:12,302
(laughing)

43
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,652
Do you like those marshmallows?

44
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,401
It's because it's sour cream.

45
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,675
- He hates sour cream too.

46
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,703
- [Dad] I'm not a big fan of
sour cream either Jackson,

47
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:21,641
do not even worry.

48
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,724
- There's beans in here?

49
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:23,669
- [Dad] Mhm.

50
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:24,649
- That's great, thank you.

51
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:28,077
- [Dad] There's beans, peppers,
scallions, pork, cheese,

52
00:02:28,077 --> 00:02:30,172
sour cream and--

53
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:33,673
- I've been eating cinnamon
rolls for four days straight.

54
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:35,857
I'm so grateful, my
cousin made them for me.

55
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:38,871
- And they're like honestly
some of the best cinnamon

56
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:40,673
rolls I have had in my
entire life, thank you guys.

57
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:41,944
- They are very good.

58
00:02:41,944 --> 00:02:43,371
- [Dad] Okay you enjoy that.

59
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,114
Hey boys I've got your plates
outside if you would like

60
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:47,576
to join me, we will have dinner together.

61
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,585
- Let's see if Calvin likes it.

62
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,564
- [Dad] Okay.

63
00:02:49,564 --> 00:02:50,482
- There you go.

64
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:51,315
- [Dad] Take a bite!

65
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:53,040
(crying)

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,156
- You don't want a bite?

67
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:57,937
- [Dad] Is it hot, he says it's hot.

68
00:02:57,937 --> 00:02:58,770
- Here let me blow on it.

69
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,688
- [Dad] Let mom blow on it firstw.

70
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:00,836
- This is a yummy bite.

71
00:03:00,836 --> 00:03:03,570
- [Dad] Oh this is cool.

72
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,393
Oh rejected!

73
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,484
Run away Calvin!

74
00:03:07,484 --> 00:03:10,304
- Now hold it and show Penny,
see because it's recording,

75
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:11,471
so show Penny.

76
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,613
(baby babbling)

77
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:21,819
- [Jackson] Cavlin!

78
00:03:24,775 --> 00:03:25,608
- Huh, huh?

79
00:03:25,608 --> 00:03:26,666
- I'm filming!

80
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:27,499
Cheese.

81
00:03:29,308 --> 00:03:31,975
Morning guys, good morning guys!

82
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:36,713
Dad I see you with this camera!

83
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,134
- Hi bud, how are ya?

84
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:38,967
- [Jackson] Good!

85
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:40,427
- Did you have fun at church today?

86
00:03:40,427 --> 00:03:42,000
- [Jackson] Uh huh.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,833
- Good.

88
00:03:44,676 --> 00:03:46,181
- [Jackson] Yeah.

89
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:47,850
- [Dad] Is Calvin going crazy over there?

90
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,267
- [Jackson] Yeah!

91
00:03:49,267 --> 00:03:51,934
(baby babbling)

92
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:05,172
(mom and dad cheering)

93
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:08,209
Yeah!

94
00:04:10,023 --> 00:04:11,106
- [Mom] Good job!

95
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:12,722
- [Dad] Yay!

96
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:15,121
- [Jackson] Do another one!

97
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,704
(gentle music)

98
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:34,491
- So our sweet friends Angie
and Blake came over today

99
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,896
and we had a long chat with
them, if you guys didn't

100
00:04:37,896 --> 00:04:40,401
know they're one of our
IVF couples and I just have

101
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:42,984
to say those guys are the best.

102
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,978
We're in constant communication
on like, we have like

103
00:04:45,978 --> 00:04:47,450
a Facebook chat that we've
all been talking to each other

104
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,726
and like keeping each
other updated on things

105
00:04:49,726 --> 00:04:52,375
and telling things about miscarriages,

106
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,822
pregnancy updates,
pregnancy announcements,

107
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,586
and it's kind of fun to
have this group where we can

108
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:01,107
talk and I'm just really
glad where we kept up with

109
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:04,985
our new family through
the internet, the internet

110
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:07,235
is an amazing place as
you guys already know,

111
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:09,386
because we're communicating though the

112
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:11,594
power of the internet, thanks Buggy.

113
00:05:11,594 --> 00:05:12,732
But I have to show you what
they brought because it was

114
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,457
just so sweet.

115
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:18,124
They have a basket of
oranges and apples and

116
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,740
there's meaning behind it and they wrote

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,767
these letters to us
and they gave us a book

118
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:26,996
called "Tear Soup" and
they brought some stuff

119
00:05:26,996 --> 00:05:30,904
for the kids, some
monster truck toys and a

120
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:32,368
monster truck book.

121
00:05:32,368 --> 00:05:34,666
So the meaning of the apple
is it's an ancient food

122
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:37,026
that brings us back to the source.

123
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:40,493
It's one of the very first
foods to have comforted us.

124
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:42,917
So apples connect us to
a sense of sanctuary.

125
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:45,339
Makes them ideal for when
you're feeling depressed,

126
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,811
alienated, invalid,
powerless, useless, worthless,

127
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,522
you get the idea.

128
00:05:51,522 --> 00:05:52,739
If the time ever comes
when you feel you aren't

129
00:05:52,739 --> 00:05:56,109
being validated, eating apples
can help change your course.

130
00:05:56,109 --> 00:06:00,674
And oranges or like a
tangerine is liquid sunshine.

131
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:02,316
If you often feel sad,
weepy and glum down,

132
00:06:02,316 --> 00:06:04,108
oranges cut through the gloom and shine

133
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:05,693
a light on your life.

134
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:08,597
It was just very sweet
so to our IVF couples

135
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:11,377
thank you guys for thinking
of us and doing that.

136
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:13,793
We love you and we support
you and you mean the

137
00:06:13,793 --> 00:06:16,450
world to us, so thank you.

138
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,121
And one of the best things
in the whole entire world

139
00:06:18,121 --> 00:06:20,270
that you can have with apples.

140
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,103
- Caramel.

141
00:06:21,103 --> 00:06:22,436
- [Dad] Caramel!

142
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:24,961
Delicious?

143
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:26,332
- It's one of my favorite treats.

144
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:27,165
Yeah.

145
00:06:27,165 --> 00:06:29,178
- I've had a lot of rage.

146
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:32,761
- [Dad] Oh Ellie, you're
gonna make me cry.

147
00:06:35,168 --> 00:06:38,289
It has been a hard day and
I think that is just kinda

148
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,987
like Ellie said, it's
gonna be a roller coaster

149
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:42,024
and that's what it's been like.

150
00:06:42,024 --> 00:06:46,436
- If I was holding you, you
would've gone through that wall.

151
00:06:46,436 --> 00:06:49,090
- Not just the camera.

152
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,192
Okay so I know it's that
direction that I would go.

153
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:54,923
- It's been like, you
literally have to mentally

154
00:06:54,923 --> 00:06:58,923
like keep yourself safe,
like I'm not doing very

155
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:01,678
hot right this second.

156
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,062
- [Dad] I'm sorry honey.

157
00:07:04,062 --> 00:07:04,895
- It's okay.

158
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:08,051
- Your hormones are
going through craziness,

159
00:07:08,051 --> 00:07:12,059
what a mental, physical,
emotional change that

160
00:07:12,059 --> 00:07:14,657
you've gone through this
week, that we've gone through.

161
00:07:14,657 --> 00:07:16,917
The hardest thing about it
I think from my perspective

162
00:07:16,917 --> 00:07:20,234
is that there's not much
you can do or say to

163
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:23,651
change anything, to make, it just better.

164
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:27,092
- Yeah there's nothing I
can do or say to even help

165
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:31,330
myself, it's just like
well (bleep), this sucks.

166
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:33,511
What the hell happened this week?

167
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:36,763
But it happened and you just
deal with it and grateful

168
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:39,479
for friends who bring sweet treats.

169
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,622
- [Dad] Yeah absolutely.

170
00:07:40,622 --> 00:07:43,357
And like I said earlier,
I think just knowing that

171
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:45,934
you're there for someone is
the best thing you can do.

172
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:47,842
- I think that's the best.

173
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,854
Like I didn't even realize
I needed a phone call

174
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:54,176
but like for Ginger to
up and call me I didn't

175
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:56,926
even think I needed it, you know.

176
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:02,437
It was sweet of her and I
appreciate it, we didn't talk

177
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:05,985
much, half the time it was
silence like "oh you doing okay?"

178
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,874
yeah, mm, mm, it was nice of her though.

179
00:08:09,874 --> 00:08:11,671
- It was nice, thanks Ginger.

180
00:08:11,671 --> 00:08:14,631
Matt called me and my brother
Nate called me while you

181
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,929
were in the operating room and just--

182
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:21,888
- I texted my sisters a bajillion times.

183
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:22,934
- Just knowing that you're
there for someone means

184
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,533
a lot to that person.

185
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:27,947
So what we're gonna do is
we're gonna drown ourselves

186
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:29,780
in apples and caramel.

187
00:08:31,673 --> 00:08:33,275
So this is where we're
gonna end it tonight,

188
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:36,707
the boys are doing good,
they're in bed asleep.

189
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,867
- They put themselves to bed tonight.

190
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:41,576
- Which thank goodness!

191
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:43,657
As you can tell this has been
very difficult and there's

192
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:47,228
more levels to it than
just what's on the surface

193
00:08:47,228 --> 00:08:51,395
and I think that's difficult,
but I think one of the coolest

194
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,112
things, coolest things, what am I saying?

195
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:59,101
One of the neatest things
if there is something

196
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:02,674
neat out of this experience
that we're going through

197
00:09:02,674 --> 00:09:05,397
is that the weirdest
part about what we do.

198
00:09:05,397 --> 00:09:09,564
When we've gone through your
comments, it's been so nice

199
00:09:10,876 --> 00:09:14,814
and almost hopeful for us
to see that so many people

200
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:18,485
have been helped through this situation.

201
00:09:18,485 --> 00:09:21,547
There's one comment in
particular that I'm thinking of,

202
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:24,716
there are these sisters
who both had miscarriages

203
00:09:24,716 --> 00:09:28,087
and they haven't talked about
it with each other and just

204
00:09:28,087 --> 00:09:30,614
seeing the way that we
went through this and then

205
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:33,237
we've vlogged about it and
talked about it has encouraged

206
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,750
these two sisters to talk
to each other about it

207
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:40,124
and it's helped them go through
their experience together.

208
00:09:40,124 --> 00:09:43,532
And so just like, it sucks for
us to go through but knowing

209
00:09:43,532 --> 00:09:48,264
that some people can
benefit from us sharing our

210
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:52,074
experience I think helps
us go through it too.

211
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:57,031
So if there is any light to
this I hope that's part of it.

212
00:09:57,031 --> 00:10:01,198
So thank you for sharing
your story with us to thank

213
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,757
you for being there, we so appreciate it.

214
00:10:07,238 --> 00:10:09,163
We're gonna say goodnight,
I hope you guys have a good

215
00:10:09,163 --> 00:00:00,000
week and we'll see you tomorrow, bye.
