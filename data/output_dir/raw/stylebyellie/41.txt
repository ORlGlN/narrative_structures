1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,500
- And here we are!

2
00:00:02,504 --> 00:00:03,630
- Dad!

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,440
- You got a little grumbly in your tumbly

4
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,273
is what you're saying.

5
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:07,106
- Is that not crazy?

6
00:00:07,106 --> 00:00:09,080
Oh you're so perfect.

7
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,450
I'm trying to wake up and open my eyes.

8
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,540
It is 3:30 a.m. in San Francisco.

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,520
I am getting ready for the day

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,070
because I have an 11
a.m. photo shoot in Utah

11
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,280
for the cookbook with all of my sisters.

12
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,230
So I am up, trying to
open my eyes, get ready.

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,620
But I think I had a pregnancy
first about 10 minutes ago.

14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm trying to really think.

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,090
I sneezed and I peed a little

16
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,960
and I'm pretty sure I've never done that

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,140
with my other pregnancies, so.

18
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,090
Alright, my face is washed
and I'm now used to the light

19
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,300
so I will not squint at you anymore.

20
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,370
(playful music)

21
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,290
Dad's turn, open up your eyeballs.

22
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,253
Good morning.

23
00:00:47,253 --> 00:00:48,086
- Good morning.

24
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:49,930
Well we are certainly back in Utah,

25
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:52,150
it is cold, it is brisk, it is

26
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,560
- Crisp morning.

27
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,740
- We are walking over to meet
up with Bonnie and the kids

28
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,690
because, guess what Ellie,

29
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,382
you're not done with this adventure.

30
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:00,215
- I'm off.

31
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:01,330
- You have more stuff to do.

32
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,200
As soon as we get back here,

33
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,129
Ellie and Bonnie are
driving down further south

34
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,449
and they're gonna do another photo shoot.

35
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,640
Because that's what you girls do

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,473
as you shoot the video.

37
00:01:07,473 --> 00:01:08,306
- But it's not like us, it's the food.

38
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:10,540
- It's the food.

39
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,010
You gonna make the food,
you gotta prep the food,

40
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,891
you gotta plate the food,
you gotta shoot the food.

41
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,424
- Are you like trying to
excuse spending an afternoon

42
00:01:15,424 --> 00:01:16,850
playing with all my sisters?

43
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,230
- That's kind of how
this cookbook is gone.

44
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,710
Hey, you wanna play with our sisters?

45
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,150
Let's make a cookbook while we're at it.

46
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,720
And here we are.

47
00:01:24,597 --> 00:01:25,473
- Hi.

48
00:01:25,473 --> 00:01:28,096
- [Jared] Hi, hi guys, how are you?

49
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:29,181
- Calvin just woke up.

50
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,725
He's like what the ...

51
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,190
- [Jared] What's going on?

52
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,023
- [Ellie] That means you woke up early.

53
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,210
- Yeah.

54
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:35,136
- [Jared] Oh no.

55
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,271
- As soon as he saw me, he was whaa

56
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,442
and then run out

57
00:01:38,442 --> 00:01:40,050
and I couldn't find him.

58
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,341
- [Jared] That is so funny.

59
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:42,174
- [Ellie] No, where was he?

60
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:43,007
- I listened quietly

61
00:01:43,007 --> 00:01:44,630
and I found him under the kitchen table.

62
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,986
- [Jared] Look at his face, he is so mad.

63
00:01:47,986 --> 00:01:50,820
- He's like scary Aunt Bonnie
in her underwear, nooo.

64
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,180
- [Ellie] Did you close
his door last night?

65
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,013
- Yeah.

66
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:54,846
- [Ellie] He opened it?

67
00:01:54,846 --> 00:01:55,679
- Yeah.

68
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,512
- What?

69
00:01:56,512 --> 00:01:57,345
- Jackson says where is my Mom?

70
00:01:57,345 --> 00:01:59,120
- [Jared] Are you playing
with her earrings?

71
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,130
- I swear I didn't sleep

72
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,930
because I was anticipating him coming in,

73
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,471
so when he did walk in,
I was like yeah come here

74
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:06,758
and he was just like whaa.

75
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:07,782
- No way.

76
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:08,782
You're not my Mom.

77
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:09,880
- [Ellie] If you would
have just shushed at that,

78
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,548
maybe he would have snuggled at you.

79
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,381
- I was so ...

80
00:02:12,381 --> 00:02:14,130
- [Jared] If you weren't so over zealous.

81
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,254
- [Ellie] So what did he
do after, you caught him?

82
00:02:16,254 --> 00:02:17,375
- He just ran.

83
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,265
Oh he started whining and I was like,

84
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,560
you're not gonna wake
up the house, be quiet.

85
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,210
I was like, do you wanna get on Mom's bed?

86
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,043
He's like no.

87
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,871
I was like, go on your
own bed then and he did.

88
00:02:25,871 --> 00:02:26,960
- Awesome.

89
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,116
Hey boys, do you wanna go
do something so fun with me?

90
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,063
- [Jackson] Yeah.

91
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:33,305
- Do you wanna go ride a bus?

92
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:34,138
- Yeah.

93
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,240
- Okay, he had to think
about it for a minute.

94
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,870
Are you guys having so
much fun riding the bus?

95
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,703
- Up.

96
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,190
- Yeah, we're going up now.

97
00:02:43,085 --> 00:02:44,360
- Where are we going up?

98
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,470
- We gotta go over this bridge,

99
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,760
so we can get to our car.

100
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:51,318
- Where is the car?

101
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:52,720
- At Missy's.

102
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,030
Okay boys, here's the deal.

103
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,970
Penny is getting a bath right now

104
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,780
and they said it'd be about two hours

105
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,170
until we can pick her up.

106
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,100
So we've gotta figure out
something that we can do

107
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,590
to kill two hours of time.

108
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,460
Any ideas, yeah?

109
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,340
Oh, I know just the thing.

110
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,160
Alright boys, we're here, we made it.

111
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,740
We're at the Tesla store.

112
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,573
- Yeah.

113
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:14,497
- [Jared] What do you guys think?

114
00:03:14,497 --> 00:03:15,330
Do you like it?

115
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,163
- Yeah.

116
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:16,996
- Yeah.

117
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:18,610
- [Jared] You like it too?

118
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,250
What do you think Mom would say?

119
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,940
Do you think Mom would say,
should we get one or no?

120
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,520
- Eh, yeah.

121
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,924
- [Jared] Mom thinks so too?

122
00:03:24,924 --> 00:03:25,850
- Yeah.

123
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,700
- You saw the big Model X
and now we're in the Model S.

124
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,030
This is the car, do you
like the car or the big one?

125
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,671
- [Jackson] The big one.

126
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,504
- The big one?

127
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:35,337
- [Jackson] And the small one.

128
00:03:35,337 --> 00:03:37,320
- And the small one?

129
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,600
What do you see?

130
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,433
What is it?

131
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:40,266
- Bath bombs.

132
00:03:40,266 --> 00:03:41,170
- Bath bombs?

133
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,620
Shall we go get Mom a bath bomb

134
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,130
and maybe you boys a bath bomb?

135
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,387
Jackson, should we get Mom
and you guys a bath bomb?

136
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:47,390
- [Jackson] Yeah.

137
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,910
- Okay, that'll be a fun surprise for her.

138
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:51,720
Okay guys, I think that
was a successful Lush stop,

139
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,756
what did you get Jackson?

140
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:53,999
- Rocket bath bomb.

141
00:03:53,999 --> 00:03:54,832
- Rocket bath bomb.

142
00:03:54,832 --> 00:03:55,665
What did you get Cal?

143
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:56,498
- Rockgrr.

144
00:03:56,498 --> 00:03:57,550
A rocket bath bomb.

145
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:01,470
And we got Mom a butter
ball and a new Jelly bomb

146
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,890
and it's filled with lavender

147
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,210
so it's like gonna help you
get to sleep or something.

148
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,280
So I'm anxious for her to try that out

149
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,113
and see what she thinks.

150
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:10,680
Okay, hold my hand and we'll cross.

151
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,230
Let's cross it, it's time for us to go,

152
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,120
let's hold our hands.

153
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,070
Here we go, we're crossing
the street safe and sound.

154
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,970
We're looking both ways
and we're crossing.

155
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,125
Do you like that train?

156
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:19,958
- [Calvin] Yeah.

157
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:20,791
- That's cool, huh?

158
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,665
We should ride the train
some day, would that be fun?

159
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:23,498
- Yeah.

160
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:24,331
- [ Jared] Yeah.

161
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,002
- I would love to ride on train.

162
00:04:26,002 --> 00:04:26,835
- [Jared] Okay.

163
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,533
- I don't cry on train.

164
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,100
- No, you don't cry on trains.

165
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,300
You don't cry a lot ever, do you?

166
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,133
- Nope.

167
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:34,940
- [Jared] And here she is, Penny.

168
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,210
You made it back, you're
here, you're safe.

169
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,270
You just walked around the corner.

170
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,960
Let's go, did you have
fun with your friend?

171
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,000
Did you play with your friends?

172
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,550
Such a pretty girl, all nice
and clean with your bath.

173
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,660
Ready, hop, good girl.

174
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,960
Well, after a long day of traveling,

175
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,170
we finally made it home.

176
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,110
And first thing we gotta
do is get our helmets on,

177
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,793
so we can ride our bikes.

178
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:57,376
(upbeat music)

179
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,210
My goodness, you blink
once and the sun is down.

180
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,900
Gosh, look how beautiful that sunset is.

181
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,230
It never does it justice,

182
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,450
you just have to take my word for it.

183
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,920
Having to pick up Penny threw
off our plans a little bit

184
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,080
because it was about
two, three hours later

185
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,970
than we expected.

186
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:34,560
So we played and had fun but
now it's like the day is over.

187
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,460
We played outside once we got home.

188
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,730
It's six o'clock, Mom's not home yet.

189
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,350
I feel happy for Ellie but kind of bad.

190
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,040
She's had three hours of
sleep, she's still gone.

191
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,390
It is six p.m. so she is
been going for like 48 hours,

192
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,870
doing high energy things,

193
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,770
smiling for pictures, having fun.

194
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,520
Would not trade this for the world

195
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,450
but I know she's tired and
she is so excited to go home.

196
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,516
What did you just say?

197
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:00,510
- Did you just buy me Lush?

198
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,601
- [Jared] What did you say before that?

199
00:06:01,601 --> 00:06:02,561
- Did you buy me Lush?

200
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:03,394
- [Jared] What did you say?

201
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:04,227
- You bought me Lush.

202
00:06:04,227 --> 00:06:05,960
- [Jared] Why, what did you say?

203
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,720
- I would like to sit in a tub.

204
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,745
- [Jared] Guess what?

205
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:10,540
- I still can't soak my back
but my butt can sit in there.

206
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,220
- Oh yeah, and your butt
needs to sit in there,

207
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,053
follow me.

208
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:15,080
- You ache.

209
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,560
- Follow me, grab my hand.

210
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,210
Have I got something just for you.

211
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,810
- Jared, if you got me Lush, are you guys.

212
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,940
I know I talk about it but
I know I don't buy a ton.

213
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,460
So if you bought me Lush.

214
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,310
- [Jared] Freeze, freeze right there.

215
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:32,360
Ba badababa baba.

216
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,680
- Why are you so perfect?

217
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,610
- Cause I love you.

218
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,670
So couple of things.

219
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,020
There are two things in there for the boys

220
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,498
and you'll probably know ones they are.

221
00:06:39,498 --> 00:06:42,490
- I had hoped that
little airplane is mine.

222
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,680
- [Jared] So once you open them.

223
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,513
- Did they love it?

224
00:06:44,513 --> 00:06:45,360
- [Jared] Oh yeah, they had so much fun.

225
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,440
- I swear my four-year old
really likes the Lush store too.

226
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,891
- Ah yeah, they love the bath bombs.

227
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:51,880
They're the ones that spotted Lush.

228
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,405
- Bonnie, your hair is in my sink.

229
00:06:53,405 --> 00:06:55,565
- [Jared] Bonnie, that's so grose.

230
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:56,398
- Bonnie, my hair isn't ...

231
00:06:56,398 --> 00:06:59,920
- Why is it that hair
off your head is grose

232
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,924
but on your head you're
like, oh it's so pretty.

233
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:03,700
- I don't think it's grose
cause it's my sister's.

234
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,020
Jared, that was so nice of you.

235
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,500
- So there's two things in here.

236
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,280
We got your normal butter ball
cause I like the butter ball

237
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,580
cause it's so moisturizing.

238
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,413
- Holy the Jolly.

239
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:12,530
- [Jared] Do you know what that is?

240
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,520
- A moon ball?

241
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,840
- It's a Jelly ball and
it's filled with lavender.

242
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,220
So it helps you relax at night.

243
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,727
After your long day traveling.

244
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:22,890
- [Ellie] You're spokesman for Lush?

245
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,120
- I may as well be.

246
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,953
But listen ...

247
00:07:24,953 --> 00:07:26,780
- So I'm just gonna sit right
here, just put right there.

248
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,410
- After a long day of traveling,

249
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:32,754
getting up at three in the
morning in San Francisco,

250
00:07:32,754 --> 00:07:36,750
flying back to Utah, not stopping

251
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,360
and going to a all-day photo shoot

252
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,440
from 9:00 a.m. until 7:00 p.m.

253
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:45,181
- Thank you.

254
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,500
- This is gonna help you relax

255
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,710
and hopefully sleep well.

256
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,620
- So this morning I said I sneezed

257
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,810
and peed my pants for the first time,

258
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,930
I'm not kidding you,

259
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:57,320
all with Jackson and Calvin I
didn't have like bowel issues,

260
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,530
I didn't feel so much pressure
that I couldn't contain pee.

261
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,540
Multiple times today I have been like,

262
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,230
I gonna go now or I will pee my pants.

263
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,730
Like I have to go now.

264
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,890
It is the weirdest thing,
I feel so much pressure.

265
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,570
And it could be just like I've
been on an airplane today,

266
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:16,370
I'm a little like swollen,
you know, I don't know.

267
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,380
But like, like when I got
home, as soon as I saw the kids

268
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,420
I like kiss them and then I
was like, let me pee first.

269
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,256
- You got a little grumbly in your tumbly,

270
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,206
it's what you're saying.

271
00:08:25,206 --> 00:08:26,039
- Is that not crazy?

272
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,360
I almost peed my pants
twice today, is that weird?

273
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,633
- Yeah, you and Calvin are
getting along just fine.

274
00:08:30,633 --> 00:08:31,466
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

275
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:34,480
- So I got you this stuff
because I want you to sleep well

276
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,179
because I have to wake up at five.

277
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,817
We're just doing this
left and right and crazy.

278
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,960
- Oh you got so much fun.

279
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,793
- [Jared] Yeah.

280
00:08:40,793 --> 00:08:41,710
- [Ellie] Sounds boring, Jared.

281
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,970
- The kids are finally asleep.

282
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,330
We're back from San Francisco,

283
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,550
Ellie is back from her photo shoot

284
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,040
and nothing has changed.

285
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,460
We are in our room at bed time.

286
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,470
- I told you I love you and kiss you.

287
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,520
- That hasn't changed either.

288
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,305
- Cause I haven't done that in a few days.

289
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:57,220
- We are in our bedroom, we've
got some snacks and a drink

290
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,340
and it's time to watch a show.

291
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,970
Thank you guys so much for watching.

292
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,570
You sneezed and peed a
little today, so that's new.

293
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,620
- That's new.

294
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,646
I hope I don't do it tomorrow,

295
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:06,070
I have a doctor's appointment.

296
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,188
- [Jared] You might do it tomorrow.

297
00:09:07,188 --> 00:09:08,969
- I might, just to impress the doctor.

298
00:09:08,969 --> 00:09:11,290
- There you go, look what I can do.

299
00:09:11,290 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye guys.
