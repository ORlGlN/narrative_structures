1
00:00:00,301 --> 00:00:01,287
- Of me holding a snake

2
00:00:01,287 --> 00:00:02,745
and it's trying to bite me,

3
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:04,900
and so I'm holding its neck really tight--

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,238
- Hey, there's my Tony Stark.

5
00:00:07,238 --> 00:00:08,071
Waa!

6
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,010
(laughing)

7
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,550
- [Ellie] We're doing
this for the third baby!

8
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,620
- [Jared] Good morning sweet girl.

9
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,453
How are you?

10
00:00:14,453 --> 00:00:15,692
That was a fun surprise.

11
00:00:15,692 --> 00:00:16,525
Waa!

12
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,775
(laughing)

13
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,030
She's trying to do zoomies in my office.

14
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,050
Oh my gosh what a pleasant surprise.

15
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,040
So I've been in my office this morning

16
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,060
getting the video uploaded

17
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,043
and Ellie let Penny--

18
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:29,430
Here she comes!

19
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,240
Ellie let Penny out of her kennel

20
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,410
and my favorite thing is when she comes

21
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,050
zooming into my office.

22
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,380
That's the first things she does.

23
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,600
Ellie let her out and
she came straight to me.

24
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,580
'Cause you're my dog, aren't you?

25
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,140
You're my sweet girl, huh?

26
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,880
Oh, that is such a good default down.

27
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,130
Okay now we can approach
you and say hello.

28
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,010
Oh, that's my girl.

29
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,040
That's my girl, oh good girl.

30
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,332
There it is.

31
00:00:52,332 --> 00:00:53,560
(laughing)

32
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,720
Good morning guys.

33
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,770
- [Ellie] These daisies have
lasted two weeks in there

34
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,460
and these little flowers,

35
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,670
they haven't quite lasted
as long as I've wanted,

36
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,000
but I think I'm gonna cut these ones

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,350
and put them over here.

38
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,590
I love having these here,

39
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,434
it's just so cheerful.

40
00:01:09,434 --> 00:01:12,084
- This one's not beautiful.

41
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:13,553
Let's cut this one.

42
00:01:13,553 --> 00:01:15,380
(Ellie laughs)

43
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,071
Say cheese.

44
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,904
- Cheese.

45
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:19,020
- [Jackson] Mommy say cheese.

46
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:21,752
- Cheese.

47
00:01:21,752 --> 00:01:23,820
Ooh, isn't that pretty?

48
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,870
- [Jackson] Yeah.

49
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,236
- [Ellie] Alright, doesn't
that look so cheerful?

50
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:29,403
- Yes they do!

51
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
- Those are the leftover flowers.

52
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,890
Jackson and I just got done watching

53
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,430
some videos of when Penny
was a brand new puppy

54
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,590
and it was so sweet.

55
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:41,860
Jackson was like, did she have sharp teeth

56
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,150
and I was like, she did.

57
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,820
We had to teach Penny
to be good to the kids

58
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,670
and the kids to be good to Penny.

59
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,640
And it's just, she is
such a good girl guys.

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,550
I would never have been able
to do this five months ago.

61
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:57,000
She would've been too
wound up, running all over.

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,790
It's just nice that she's
grown up a little bit.

63
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,220
She's a year and a half.

64
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,930
She's just getting so big, huh girl?

65
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,130
I just love watching little videos of her

66
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,180
when she could fit under the couch, huh?

67
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,789
You would run under the couch.

68
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,500
And you would hide and you
would sleep under there.

69
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,700
We had to teach her not to rip at the rug

70
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,640
at the edge.

71
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,150
She's been so good.

72
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,670
Aww, Penny girl.

73
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,828
What's in your mouth?

74
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:20,670
One of the kids' wrappers or something?

75
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,460
What are you doing?

76
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,450
A little update on Penny,

77
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,930
you're doing so good.

78
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,430
I really enjoy Penny.

79
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,470
There's been many man days of frustrations

80
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,500
just because at the time
we had even smaller babies

81
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,800
and then a puppy.

82
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,980
You know, she's still a puppy,

83
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,710
but you're just a good puppy.

84
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,570
She just has learned to behave

85
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,210
and it's just been really nice, huh?

86
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,250
And you're happy.

87
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,950
You played outside in
the front yard today.

88
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,930
we don't let her in the
front yard a whole ton,

89
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,470
because she will just run wild

90
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,700
and then we have the neighbor dog

91
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,870
that she goes and plays with,

92
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,280
but today she stayed right
by Jared's side, huh,

93
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
right by the kids' side.

94
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,620
You're just soft, huh,

95
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,390
even if I put my fingers in your mouth,

96
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,290
you're just soft.

97
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,800
I love that about labs.

98
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,890
I've never head another kind of dog,

99
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,220
we've just always had labs

100
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,850
and she's just soft.

101
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,090
Never has she bit,

102
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,680
I mean obviously being puppy teeth,

103
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,030
but you're just a good girl, huh?

104
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,960
Huh, sweet Penny.

105
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,270
Okay, where's Dad's office?

106
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,140
Where's his office?

107
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,560
Where do you always run to, huh?

108
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,393
Where?

109
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:14,226
Penny Penny Penny.

110
00:03:14,226 --> 00:03:15,170
Ooh drop, good girl.

111
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,450
Where's Dad's office?

112
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,140
That's her favorite spot,
as you can see this morning.

113
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,620
This is where she goes

114
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,710
and then she says hello.

115
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,090
- Hello.

116
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,110
- [Ellie] Hasn't she been so good?

117
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,670
I feel like we haven't
talked about her tons,

118
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,800
but I'm just thinking about you

119
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,743
and how much life has changed.

120
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:31,817
- She's been a good doggo.

121
00:03:31,817 --> 00:03:33,110
- And you know what I can't wait for?

122
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,570
I was telling Bonnie,

123
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,890
I was like I'm excited
to bring a new baby home

124
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,900
and introduce Penny to a new baby

125
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,130
and see how she reacts.

126
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,950
When my parents got our lab growing up,

127
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:47,540
my mom said that our dog just
knew not to mess with me,

128
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,560
like she just was so soft around me.

129
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,350
And Bonnie was like, instincts
are real and uncontrollable.

130
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,380
And isn't that so true,

131
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,020
have you ever had an
instinct and you just do it

132
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,410
and you're like, I'm sorry I just jumped

133
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,640
and grabbed someone else's kid,

134
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,500
when I saw them falling

135
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,400
and it was just your
instinct and you just do it.

136
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,260
Dogs have those instincts too, huh,

137
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,431
and I'm excited to see
her with the new baby.

142
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,166
- Why?

143
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:15,999

144
00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:18,500
- I don't want you to laugh at me.

145
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,360

146

that you keep singing her songs.

149
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,700
Look at her legs.

150
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,330
- I love when she stretches
her body out like that.

151
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,443
- I've never seen a lab do that.

152
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:31,450
Or I guess, my old lab never did that,

153
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,490
that I remember.

154
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,270
It is so funny.

155
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:36,025
- [Jared] She's just like stretch it out.

156
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,620
- [Ellie] And of course,
she doesn't like her pillow.

157
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,740
- She will sit on it every once in awhile.

158
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,110
Like when she's really tired,

159
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,620
she's like, okay I'll sit on it,

160
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,880
but she likes the hardwood
floor for some reason.

161
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,310
- [Ellie] It's cool to her.

162
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,143
- Yeah.

163
00:04:47,143 --> 00:04:48,960
Sorry Dad, I'm not gonna sit
on the expensive new pillow

164
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
you got for your office,

165
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,600

178

- [Ellie[ Well she just took that ball

179
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,660
and it whipped Jackson's head.

180
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,612

Okay, just push it in there and turn.

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,719
- [Ellie] Okay Jared, we're
doing this for the third baby!

183
00:05:21,719 --> 00:05:22,810
- Can you believe that?

184
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,530
It's pretty cool we're
getting two babies worth

185
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,800
out of this crib.

186
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,740
- [Calvin] Where's my bed?

187
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,684
(Ellie laughs)

188
00:05:31,684 --> 00:05:33,360
- [Jared] Where's my bed?

189
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,510
- [Ellie] Calvin, is this
gonna be for baby brother?

190
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,343
- No, my bed.

191
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:38,640
- [Ellie] It's your bed?

192
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,820
You haven't slept in here in a few weeks.

193
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,360
- I want to do this.
- Okay.

194
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,550
- [Ellie] Is this gonna
be baby brother's, huh?

195
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,680
- Is this gonna be your baby brother's?

196
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,513
- Yeah.

197
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,420
- Yep.

198
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,854
Is this the baby's bed?

199
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:49,687
- Mmm-hmm.

200
00:05:49,687 --> 00:05:51,227
- Yeah and where's your bed?

201
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,060
- Down?

202
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,694
- Downstairs, that's right.

203
00:05:53,694 --> 00:05:55,251
- Yeah right.

204
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,334
- Yeah right.

205
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:58,190
- I'm gonna do another one.

206
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,246
- [Jared] Good job.

207
00:05:59,246 --> 00:06:00,220
- [Calvin] Me.

208
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,053
- You want to try it?

209
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:01,886
Come turn that.

210
00:06:01,886 --> 00:06:03,420
Okay, turn it this way.

211
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,630
Good job Calvin.

212
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,160
You guys are such good helpers.

213
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,130
Okay, get your hand off it,

214
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,080
'cause it's gonna come down.

215
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,000
- Alright we have the baby's bed coming.

216
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
Penny girl, you're being good in here.

217
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,090
Jackson, get off of my phone.

218
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,923
- No!

219
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,268
- [Ellie] The boys were playing.

220
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:20,844
- My phone!

221
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:21,820
- [Jared] Your phone?

222
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,360
- [Ellie] Alright we have
the baby's crib going.

223
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,080
The boys are happy building with us.

224
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,630
Can you believe that
George has been around

225
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,060
since you Jackson?

226
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,514
- [Jared] George has been
with us for a long time.

227
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,347
(Calvin yells)

228
00:06:32,347 --> 00:06:33,257
- [Ellie] Yep.

229
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:36,085
- [Jared] Here's the baby's baby blanket.

230
00:06:36,085 --> 00:06:36,918
- Isn't that sweet?

231
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,325
- It's so soft.

232
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,158
- [Jared] It's soft?

233
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:39,991
- Soft.

234
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:40,824
- [Jared] Yeah.

235
00:06:40,824 --> 00:06:42,026
- He's gonna love it.

236
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,619
- [Jared] Okay, let's put it on.

237
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,360
- He's gonna love it.

238
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,710
- [Jared] You know what, we're gonna have

239
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,970
to change that picture.

240
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,000
Sorry, Calvin, you've been evicted.

241
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,254
- Or we'll just leave
it, you're the third kid.

242
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:54,990
(Jared laughs)

243
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:55,905
(boys laughing)

244
00:06:55,905 --> 00:06:57,687
Isn't that cute?

245
00:06:57,687 --> 00:06:59,937
(laughing)

246
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,710
- [Jared] Goodnight guys.

247
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,440
Take a nap.

248
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,740
Bye.

249
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,000
Mommy and Daddy are going on a daaaaate.

250
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:11,266
- [Boys] No!

251
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,100
(Jared laughing)

252
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,550
- Well it is almost all the way done.

253
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,910
The crib is assembled and I
love what we've done so far.

254
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,660
We have a combination of old and new.

255
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,350
Ellie and baby.

256
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:28,390
- The baby bedding is coming.

257
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,010
The only thing we got
is a little crib thing

258
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,230
to guard the top and it's a skirt

259
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,920
and it's just green, it's green leaves.

260
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,170
So it'll be really pretty

261
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,403
with the touch of green
of this that my mom made.

262
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,737
And--

263
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:44,570
- [Jared] It's just sweet.

264
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,470
- This is feeling very sweet.

265
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,303
- [Jared] Yeah.

266
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,960
Hey, are you having a hard
time getting those on?

267
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,793
- Yeah.

268
00:07:49,793 --> 00:07:50,626
- [Jared] Would you like some help?

269
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:51,459
- No.

270
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,410
- [Jared] Okay you want to do it.

271
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,940
Look at you go Ironman,

272
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,850
you're doing it all by
yourself, great job.

273
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,330
Hey, there's my Tony Stark.

274
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,670
- Your thing just came
through for me to accept.

275
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,766
- [Jared] In one hour later.

276
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:03,879
- Okay now.

277
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,712
- Okay.

278
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:05,545
- [Jared] Now we gotta buckle you up.

279
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:06,450
- You need new ones.

280
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,380
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm, you're
growing up too fast.

281
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,213
- Mmm-hmm.

282
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,640
- [Jared] Yes you are,
are you big and strong?

283
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,740
Show me your muscles.

284
00:08:13,871 --> 00:08:14,704
Wow you are so strong.

285
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:18,380
- So I am 20 weeks, I
will be 21 weeks this week

286
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,110
and I want to do a little update

287
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,940
for the end of our vlog.

288
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,580
I have been tickled as we
have been getting this room

289
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,102
set up and I have a little list of things

290
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:28,720
of how I've been feeling.

291
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,090
So I have been having a lot
of back pain and pressure

292
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,696
this week, I have noticed.

293
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,529
- Mmm-hmm.

294
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:36,919
- And I am continuing to
go to the chiropractor.

295
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,859
- And I feel like that's
been one of the best things

296
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,371
that you've been doing for yourself.

297
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,279
- Totally.

298
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,113
- Absolutely,

299
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:43,230
your headaches are going away.
- Night and day.

300
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,990
- And I feel like your
back pain has lessened.

301
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,430
It's still there, but it's lessened.

302
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,240
- I did have an appointment set up

303
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,230
to go get the inner
part of my ear pierced,

304
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,400
that helps with migraines,

305
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,090
but he said he can't do pregnant women.

306
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,830
I'm sure there are some places that would,

307
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,308
but this guy said he,
for liability reasons

308
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:00,610
or something, he doesn't,

309
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,450
- Mmm-hmm.

310
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,960
- And it would've been nice,

311
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,130
because I feel like it
still would help me,

312
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,250
but going to he chiropractor
alone once a week

313
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,878
has completely changed me.

314
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,770
My body feels better,

315
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,330
my back feels better,

316
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,500
just everything is good,

317
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,666
so I am very glad that I'm doing that.

318
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,370
- And I'm glad that the
appointments aren't too long.

319
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,760
You're there for 15 minutes

320
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,010
and boom, done.
- Yeah.

321
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,890
- Totally.

322
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,250
I feel the baby a lot.

323
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,130
Jared quite hasn't felt tons of kicks,

324
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,920
but he's definitely felt his body.

325
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,390
- Yeah, when I push on certain areas,

326
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,243
I can feel where the baby is

327
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:35,845
and then the baby's like,
Dad, stop pushing on me

328
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:36,678
- And then he moves

329
00:09:36,678 --> 00:09:37,522
- and then he goes somewhere else.

330
00:09:37,522 --> 00:09:38,355
(laughs)

331
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:41,550
- I have noticed that my
skin has gotten much better.

332
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,260
There was a long time that I was having

333
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,880
a ton of breakouts, like
on my chest, my back

334
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,570
and my face, but I've
noticed that everything

335
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,420
just kind of seems calm right now.

336
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,850
I am getting a lot more full,

337
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,150
like swelling when I wake up.

338
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,440
My hands are really full.

339
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,400
I need to drink more water,

340
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,710
but I'm definitely feeling the pressure,

341
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,680
the fullness right now.

342
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,240
- Especially on our trip to San Francisco.

343
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,790
When we were at the airport,

344
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,623
- Yes.

345
00:10:05,623 --> 00:10:06,456
- And on the airplane,

346
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,289
I definitely could tell that you had

347
00:10:07,289 --> 00:10:09,490
a little swelling going on

348
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,160
in your feet and your hands.

349
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,150
Now for me, my chest area,

350
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,614
I've been having some breakouts there,

351
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,447
(Ellie laughs)

352
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,381
like one or two but--

353
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:17,350
- Do your nipples hurt?

354
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,343
- Not so much yet,

355
00:10:18,343 --> 00:10:19,176
- Okay.

356
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,009
- But I feel like they're getting

357
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,630
a little tingling sensation on,

358
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,500
and maybe that's just
the lactation coming,

359
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,461
I'm totally kidding.
- Oh my gosh,

360
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,400
- I'm gonna keep going.

361
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,201
My dreams have been out of this world.

362
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,792
- Yes they have and I feel bad.

363
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:33,150
- I've been having dreams
that Jared and I fight a lot.

364
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,633
And in our day to day life,

365
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,340
life has been good.

366
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,667
- Yeah, our arguments have
decreased quite a bit.

367
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,840
- We haven't been fighting

368
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,550
and so it's kind of interesting

369
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,937
that all my dreams are is about me

370
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,230
fighting with him.

371
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,790
And then I've had two
dreams of me holding a snake

372
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:52,070
and it's trying to bite me,

373
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,270
and so I'm holding its neck really tight,

374
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,240
so he can't bend down and bite me,

375
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,250
but then he'll get away and he'll bite me.

376
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,300
And I looked it and it was like,

377
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,090
are you feeling insecure with life,

378
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,970
are you feeling stressed in life,

379
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,510
are you having doubts and I'm like--

380
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,274
- Have you been watching Indiana Jones?

381
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:12,350
- No, but my dreams have
been out of this world.

382
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,300
- If you guys are dream interpreters,

383
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,810
let us know in the comments down below

384
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,643
what it means.

385
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:20,540
- I am going to be doing a
huge baby haul on Monday.

386
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,650
I'm gonna film it, and that's
gonna be a whole video,

387
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,200
because I'm just gonna talk
tons about baby products.

388
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,150
When Jared and I went to San Francisco,

389
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,580
I was looking at bassinets,

390
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,590
between the Halo and the Snoo.

391
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,310
And we met Dr, what's his name?

392
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,530
- Harvey something.

393
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,630
He's the author of
Happiest Baby on the Block,

394
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,260
Happiest Toddler on the Block

395
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,330
and I said if you need any help

396
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,380
to write Happiest Husband on the Block

397
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,100
I'm a good example to use because--

398
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,060
- He thought that was funny.

399
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,940
- I'm the happiest husband on the block.

400
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,700
- It was awesome to meet him and--

401
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,800
- Harvey Salk?

402
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,810
Something like that.

403
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,210
- But I've gone back and forth,

404
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:57,650
because I am so happy spending an amount

405
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,483
on a baby item.

406
00:11:58,483 --> 00:11:59,820
I do not have a problem with that.

407
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,710
When we bought this rocking chair,

408
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,070
it was quite a bit,

409
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,163
and it was hard to do,

410
00:12:05,163 --> 00:12:07,770
because it's like, do we
really need to spend that much?

411
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,020
But it's the one thing that I was like,

412
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,800
we're gonna have it for
years and years to come.

413
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,390
I want it to be really comfy.

414
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,830
I'm glad we spent the money on it.

415
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,740
- If it makes a difference,

416
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,660
it's worth it.

417
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,446
For example, we bought the Mamaroo,

418
00:12:19,446 --> 00:12:20,279
- And that's expensive

419
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,380
- because we heard so many great things.

420
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,213
And it's expensive.

421
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:23,640
In fact, we bought it twice.

422
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,473
- For each baby.

423
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:25,570
- and we returned them both times,

424
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,960
because it just didn't make the difference

425
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
that we were looking for.

426
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,030
- And our babies just didn't like it.

427
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,863
- Right.

428
00:12:31,863 --> 00:12:33,110
- Like it was narrow on their--

429
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,220
they just didn't like it.

430
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,230
And so we ended up returning them.

431
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,870
And I told Jeremy, I'm
like maybe we'll just wait

432
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,230
until the baby comes and if
he's colicky like Calvin was,

433
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,640
maybe then we'll get it.

434
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,760
But Jared just told me today

435
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,430
that they're having 40% off of it,

436
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,060
and I'm like ah dangit.

437
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,893
- Yeah.

438
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,960
- We're probably going
to get the Snoo bassinet,

439
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,720
just because of the ratings,

440
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,390
the background, the history,

441
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,610
the discount.
- Honestly,

442
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,630
- Do you want to tell them about it,

443
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,500
you're the tech guy.

444
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,339
- Well yeah, so real quick,

445
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:01,530
I would love to get the Snoo and the Halo.

446
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,363
- No way.

447
00:13:02,363 --> 00:13:03,196
(Ellie laughs)

448
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,580
- Just to test 'em and
just see the difference.

449
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,622
I would personally love to do that,

450
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:06,455
- Okay.

451
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,640
- but that's the tech guy in side of me

452
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,100
to be like okay, let's compare 'em

453
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,659
and see what's one best, but real quick--

454
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,270
- Okay, I shouldn't shoot that down.

455
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,103
- That's okay.

456
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:14,760
- If that's something that would be fun

457
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,520
to make a video on and
it would help people,

458
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,750
maybe we would do that.

459
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,570
- Yeah, let us know in
the comments down below

460
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,530
if you would like to see that

461
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:22,510
and I'm dead serious.

462
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,343
- Yeah.

463
00:13:23,343 --> 00:13:25,170
- But the Snoo, essentially what it does,

464
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:28,840
is there's four S's in soothing your baby,

465
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,620
which is what the doctor
designed this for.

466
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,370
There's, I can't remember them all,

467
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,510
shushing, soothing, sleeping,
something like that.

468
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,250
But it moves the baby a little bit

469
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,060
and then it does white noise.

470
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,100
And it varies, based on the crying.

471
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,390
It'll move a little bit more

472
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:47,370
if the baby's crying.

473
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,020
If the baby's quiet and asleep,

474
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,120
it'll move less.

475
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,730
There's even a weaning option,

476
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,220
that you can connect with your Smartphone,

477
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,290
that's the other thing is it connects

478
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:56,123
with your Smartphone,

479
00:13:56,123 --> 00:13:58,150
so you see and hear
everything that's going on.

480
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,310
That will slowly transition
into crib sleeping

481
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,400
at six months.

482
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
And so there's lot of tech inside of this,

483
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,140
it's really beautifully designed.

484
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,280
And it's just smart.

485
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,660
And I don't think it was around

486
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,190
when we had Jackson or Calvin.

487
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,740
- Oh totally not, or I
might have been like,

488
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,460
that might be worth
it, we're gonna try it.

489
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,580
I was desperate.

490
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:19,670
- And the Halo Bassinet is cool,

491
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,670
because it swivels right onto your bed,

492
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,010
so it can be right next to you

493
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,670
for really great co-sleeping

494
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,230
and it bends down, so
you can reach in and out

495
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,700
really easily from your bed.

496
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,380
And I think it was designed with mothers

497
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,020
who have had C-sections

498
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,340
and makes it easy for
recovery with C-sections.

499
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,780
- Jared knows more about this than me,

500
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,752
because of the tech.

501
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:42,880
(laughing)

502
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,760
I did not know that.

503
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,680
- The Snoo is way more expensive

504
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,800
than the Halo, so that's also
something to keep in mind.

505
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,633
- Yeah.

506
00:14:49,633 --> 00:14:51,010
- But benefits and cons and I think

507
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:51,923
that's why I want to do the test.

508
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,910
- Okay my first initial reaction was

509
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:55,360
heck no, we're not
gonna, we don't need two,

510
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,220
but to make a video purpose,

511
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,053
that might be nice.

512
00:14:58,053 --> 00:14:59,460
So that's our update.

513
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,380
I emotionally am feeling better this week

514
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,600
than I was a few weeks ago.

515
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,450
A few weeks ago, I had
picked up the camera

516
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:07,350
and I was like nevermind,

517
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,350
I just can't, but the last
week has been very good,

518
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:14,280
because I've been feeling better.

519
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,870
- And I think some of it has to do

520
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,340
with you can see the sun is just shining.

521
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,150
It's getting a little warmer.

522
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,700
And I feel like that
has a small part to play

523
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,230
in that too.
- Totally.

524
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,090
- Totally.

525
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,500
We're excited for baby.

526
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,330
Jackson, Calvin every day, baby?

527
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,010
And he'll look at my tummy, every day.

528
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,290
It is very sweet.

529
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,770
The bedding is gonna come soon.

530
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,390
We've got the blanket my mom made.

531
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:42,070
Of course, all my boys
have Minky blankets.

532
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,470
He has his right here waiting.

533
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:45,610
So this is it.

534
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,040
This is life right now.

535
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,317
- We are getting ready for our baby.

536
00:15:49,317 --> 00:15:50,510
This is the nursery room

537
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,700
and we're getting it all set up.

538
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,450
