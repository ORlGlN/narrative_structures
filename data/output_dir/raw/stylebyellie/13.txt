1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,721
- Oh! (laughing)

2
00:00:02,721 --> 00:00:05,652
Hey, what are you guys doing?

3
00:00:05,652 --> 00:00:07,820
Excuse me, young man.

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,297
- The chances of that happening is like

5
00:00:09,297 --> 00:00:11,330
the chances of you getting a Tesla.

6
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,830
- Oh my gosh.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,243
Ellie? Ellie?

8
00:00:14,243 --> 00:00:16,716
Grab onto my hand.

9
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,590
Good morning!

10
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:22,940
I cannot believe how much of
an improvement last night was.

11
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,066
- Now we're just frying pancakes.

12
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:26,577
- [Jared] What are we making?

13
00:00:26,577 --> 00:00:29,110
- Um, this one's pancakes.

14
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:30,450
- [Jared] Pancakes!

15
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,328
Mom is making some pancakes right now.

16
00:00:33,328 --> 00:00:35,046
- Last night was amazing sleep.

17
00:00:35,046 --> 00:00:36,060
- [Jared] It was so good.

18
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,020
- I mean, especially with
that pillow, it's the best.

19
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,218
- [Jared] Ellie, I feel
like you're kind of spoiled

20
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:41,420
right now with that pregnancy pillow.

21
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,870
It's just like a cocoon of happiness.

22
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,111
- I'll spoil myself for the nine months,

23
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,100
and every day of my life. (laughs)

24
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,230
- [Jared] You get it, girl.

25
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,063
What's up, dude?

26
00:00:47,063 --> 00:00:48,140
What are you finding?

27
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,136
- I was spinning, and I--

28
00:00:50,136 --> 00:00:53,370
- [Jared] Oh my goodness,
look at Mario go.

29
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,500
Did you know we just celebrated Mario Day

30
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,140
not too long ago, a few days ago?

31
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,960
March 10th is Mario Day.

32
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,090
What does Mario say?

33
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,165
- [Ellie] We didn't do anything for it.

34
00:01:01,165 --> 00:01:02,124
- Let's-a go!

35
00:01:02,124 --> 00:01:03,408
- [Jared] Let's-a go!

36
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:05,565
Ha-ha! Hoo! Ha!

37
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,506
It's-a me, a-Mario!

38
00:01:07,506 --> 00:01:08,756
- Huh, hee, ha!

39
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,192
Me, mah!

40
00:01:11,192 --> 00:01:13,260
- [Jared] (laughs) Good job, bud!

41
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,153
- Calvin say, "It's me, Mario!"

42
00:01:15,153 --> 00:01:16,153
- Me, Mario!

43
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,880
- [Jared] (laughs)

44
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,090
As they're getting breakfast ready,

45
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,330
I wanted to tell you about Penny.

46
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,010
I kind of feel like
we've talked about Penny

47
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,443
a lot this trip, but she has just

48
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:27,170
been doing so good this trip.

49
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,921
We just got back from the dog run.

50
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,410
They have a little place where you can

51
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,210
let the dogs out, and have them go potty

52
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,510
and play with other dogs and everything.

53
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,446
And, you know, Penny's
personality, she's so friendly,

54
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:38,574
and she loves to see other dogs and play.

55
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:41,285
But she has been very
good to be by my side

56
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,010
while we're running around.

57
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,809
And so I'm just so proud
of you this trip, Penny.

58
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:46,731
We thought you were gonna
be the one giving us

59
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,314
lots of headaches and everything,

60
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:50,200
but it's not you at all.

61
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,106
It's the kids! (laughs)

62
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:54,570
No, the kids have
actually been pretty good.

63
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,536
Last night was awesome.

64
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:58,650
Yesterday was great, and today
is going to be even better.

65
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,008
I feel like we're just getting acclimated

66
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:02,565
and adjusted to all of this, the space,

67
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:05,916
what we need to do, and
things are going really great.

68
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,060
So very happy with how things are going.

69
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,401
You ready for another day, Penny girl?

70
00:02:09,401 --> 00:02:10,234
(dog snorts)

71
00:02:10,234 --> 00:02:13,246
Oh, yeah, there you go, just
had to cough up that hairball.

72
00:02:13,246 --> 00:02:15,913
(relaxed music)

73
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:32,882
(Calvin vocalizing)

74
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:34,965
- Dad, why Penn lay down?

75
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,161
- [Ellie] She laid down?

76
00:02:37,161 --> 00:02:40,239
Well, why were you yelling at her?

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,060
- Don't want touch this.

78
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,699
- [Ellie] You want her not to touch that?

79
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,250
- Uh-uh.

80
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,083
Hi, Penn.

81
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,290
- [Ellie] 'Kay, we gotta get dressed

82
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,010
so we can go on a walk with her, okay?

83
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,537
- No, wanna see Penn.

84
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:54,420
- [Ellie] Let's go play!

85
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,240
Let's go get dressed so we can go play!

86
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,230
Hey, did you get into my pads?

87
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,170
What is that?

88
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:01,090
- [Jared] That's a little popcorn sticker.

89
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,760
- [Ellie] Oh! (laughs)

90
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,380
- But not quite as absorbent
as you might think.

91
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,620
- That was the funniest thing.

92
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,145
Jared and I were getting
ready to go out today,

93
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:10,670
and this whole trip is really just to be,

94
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,200
like, out in the sun.

95
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,731
There are so many cool things
to do in Vegas with kids.

96
00:03:14,731 --> 00:03:17,070
But we are going to
come back with the kids

97
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,161
actually pretty soon, and
do that kind of stuff,

98
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:22,515
but right now, we're just
taking Penny, going on hikes,

99
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:25,000
going to parks, just being outdoors.

100
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,703
So, Dad has figured out where we're going,

101
00:03:26,703 --> 00:03:29,120
we have to get dressed, let's go.

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,910
This view is okay.

103
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,287
- Yeah, it's just all right.

104
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:34,030
It's okay, right?

105
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,410
It's not that great.

106
00:03:38,892 --> 00:03:40,642
Whoa! It's beautiful!

107
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:44,386
Look at that over there!

108
00:03:44,386 --> 00:03:45,821
Look at that over there!

109
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,766
- [Ellie] This is
beautiful, much prettier.

110
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:48,820
- [Jared] It's amazing!

111
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,433
Yeah, I don't know what
they were doing back there,

112
00:03:50,433 --> 00:03:54,683
that was ugly, but this is scenic, oh man.

113
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,359
Move that sign, ladies and gents,

114
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:59,973
because that valley is on fire.

115
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,951
- [Ellie] (chuckles) This is beautiful.

116
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,946
- The valley's on fire.

117
00:04:02,946 --> 00:04:03,993
It is beautiful.

118
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:04,850
But do you want to know what the

119
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,196
most beautiful view in the world is?

120
00:04:06,196 --> 00:04:08,426
(tooting noise)

121
00:04:08,426 --> 00:04:09,350
- (laughs) I look so--

122
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,435
- [Jared] It's right, it's right here.

123
00:04:11,435 --> 00:04:13,600
- I'm so pregnant.

124
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,450
I can totally tell my face is filling out.

125
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,610
Huh? Huh, baby?

126
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,442
Crazy.

127
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:19,529
- [Jared] Campground is full?

128
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,362
Can't camp here.

129
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:24,370
- This place doesn't have an ocean.

130
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,381
- [Ellie] No, this is really dry, huh?

131
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,298
- And really soft sand.

132
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,269
(upbeat music)

133
00:04:59,898 --> 00:05:00,898
- [All] Hey!

134
00:05:03,366 --> 00:05:05,949
(upbeat music)

135
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:36,520
- [Jackson] Hey, Dad!

136
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,407
- [Jared] Hi!

137
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,280
- [Calvin] Up there!

138
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,744
- [Jared] They're all the way up there!

139
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:41,577
- [Calvin] Yeah.

140
00:05:41,577 --> 00:05:44,590
- [Ellie] Jared, we made it!

141
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:45,841
- [Jared] Oh my gosh, Jackson just climbed

142
00:05:45,841 --> 00:05:48,889
that whole thing by himself!

143
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,107
- There was the cutest
little boys that climbed up,

144
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:53,140
and they're like 10, and
he's like, "I'm gonna do it."

145
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,220
I'm like, "Okay."

146
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,260
Didn't think he'd make it.

147
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,142
- [Jared] Are you okay up there?

148
00:05:56,142 --> 00:05:56,975
- Yeah.

149
00:05:56,975 --> 00:05:57,808
- [Jared] Do you wanna trade me places?

150
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:58,641
- Nope.

151
00:05:58,641 --> 00:05:59,474
- [Jared] Okay.

152
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:00,307
You're so brave, Jackson.

153
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,350
- [Jackson] I know, Dad.

154
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,510
- [Jared] Oh, yes you do know. (chuckling)

155
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,138
Whoa! You guys are climbing so high!

156
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:07,091
- [Jackson] Yeah.

157
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:08,026
- [Jared] Is it so awesome?

158
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:08,859
- [Jackson] Yeah.

159
00:06:08,859 --> 00:06:09,820
- [Jared] Can you make it up, bud?

160
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,061
Grab onto my hand!

161
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:13,311
(grunting)

162
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:21,296
Good job! (laughing)

163
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,180
Good job, Jackson!

164
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,130
You helped Calvin out!

165
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,363
You did it, Cal!

166
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,010
That's brotherly love right there.

167
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:28,843
- [Jackson] Yeah.

168
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:29,676
- [Jared] Yeah.

169
00:06:29,676 --> 00:06:30,512
Are you guys having fun today?

170
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:31,345
- [Both] Yeah.

171
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:32,324
- [Ellie] Hey, can you
do that with the baby

172
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:33,162
when he needs to come?

173
00:06:33,162 --> 00:06:34,680
- [Jared] (laughs)

174
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,783
So I think if you look
closely on that black part,

175
00:06:36,783 --> 00:06:41,103
there is a spiral part, which I think is a

176
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:43,347
peroglyph or teroglyph
or something like that,

177
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,030
like a fossil-like thing.

178
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:49,537
And this whole area right over
here is called Mouse Tank.

179
00:06:49,537 --> 00:06:50,860
Yeah, Mouse Tank.

180
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,835
In the 1890's there was an
outlaw who had come out here

181
00:06:53,835 --> 00:06:57,850
and, like, hide away, 'cause
down in that little area

182
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,858
over there, there's a
little water reservoir,

183
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:03,080
and there'd be water there
for months out of the summer.

184
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,743
So this is a cool little cove
area that we just explored.

185
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,522
You guys ready to rock?

186
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:10,412
- [Calvin] Yeah!

187
00:07:10,412 --> 00:07:11,433
- Yeah!

188
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,770
Look guys, we are in a cave.

189
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,370
Is this so cool?

190
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,550
I wonder if there's something
that lives up there.

191
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,030
- Maybe there's a ghost.

192
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:19,863
- [Jared] Maybe.

193
00:07:19,863 --> 00:07:22,290
These boys are looking
through a tiny, tiny hole,

194
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,773
and Mom's taking a picture.

195
00:07:27,716 --> 00:07:28,740
- I love you.

196
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,953
- No, I love you.

197
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,742
- I don't feel like I ask a lot in life,

198
00:07:35,742 --> 00:07:38,265
but today, I'm making a request.

199
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:40,428
All I really want to see is a rock

200
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,037
that looks like an elephant.

201
00:07:42,037 --> 00:07:43,592
Is that too much to ask?

202
00:07:43,592 --> 00:07:46,200
I just want to see a rock
that looks like an elephant.

203
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,156
- The chances of that
happening is like the chances

204
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:49,730
of you getting a Tesla.

205
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,649
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

206
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,150
- Which is pretty great, so
go find an elephant rock.

207
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,960
- Oh my gosh, you heard it!

208
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,744
Oh my gosh, Ellie? Ellie?

209
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,780
That's a rock that looks like an elephant.

210
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,130
That's a rock that looks like an elephant.

211
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,783
Dream is fulfilled!

212
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,943
We did it, and it only took two minutes!

213
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,850
I don't see exactly how
it looks like an elephant.

214
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:09,867
- [Ellie] You can totally see it!

215
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:12,253
- [Jared] But that sign right
there says it's an elephant.

216
00:08:12,253 --> 00:08:13,626
- The trunk, the mouth.

217
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,106
I saw pictures online, people said

218
00:08:15,106 --> 00:08:17,230
it's looked worse the last few years

219
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,614
than it used to, like with
the drought and stuff.

220
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:21,290
But I think it looks good!

221
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,366
- Yeah, I think it looks like,
kind of like an elephant.

222
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:26,996
You can see the leg and
the trunk and all that.

223
00:08:26,996 --> 00:08:28,496
- You're gross.

224
00:08:28,496 --> 00:08:30,688
You're gross. (kids laughing)

225
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:31,771
You're gross.

226
00:08:33,015 --> 00:08:34,386
Ew! (kids laughing)

227
00:08:34,386 --> 00:08:36,963
Where did you learn to pick your nose?

228
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:38,866
- [Jared] Are you kidding me?!

229
00:08:38,866 --> 00:08:39,699
- [Ellie] (laughs)

230
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,602
Did your Mom teach you
that, or did your Dad?

231
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:43,969
Who taught you to pick your nose?

232
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,470
That's gross. Me?!

233
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:47,605
You better say your Dad!

234
00:08:47,605 --> 00:08:48,801
(Jackson laughs)

235
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,000
Who taught you to pick your nose?

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
- [Jared] Ellie, you spend more time

237
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,265
with your finger in your
nose than in your pockets.

238
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:57,300
- [Ellie] Hey, who taught
you to pick your nose?

239
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,838
- Um, you.

240
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:00,887
- [Ellie] Me?!

241
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:02,267
Did Penny? Penny did it.

242
00:09:02,267 --> 00:09:03,180
- Yeah.

243
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,227
- Let's blame it on Penny.

244
00:09:04,227 --> 00:09:06,393
- [Jared] No, Mom's the culprit.

245
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:09,060
(kids laughing)

246
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,800
- No, I don't want to open
your fruit snacks for you!

247
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,883
I want to open it for me!

248
00:09:19,787 --> 00:09:22,307
I'm just trying to put on
my socks. (Jared laughs)

249
00:09:22,307 --> 00:09:24,480
You are driving me crazy!

250
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,400
- [Jared] He is enforcing a choke hold.

251
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,760
To try and get you to open that.

252
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,030
- He's strong!

253
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:30,178
Do you want me to open it?

254
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,100
Want me to open it?

255
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,269
Hey, can I have one?

256
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,102
- [Calvin] Uh, yeah.

257
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,418
- The tax that Mom gets.
- [Jared] The Mommy tax.

258
00:09:36,418 --> 00:09:39,030
- [Calvin] No, this is mine!

259
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,863
- That one's yours?

260
00:09:39,863 --> 00:09:40,696
- Uh-huh!

261
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:44,730
- I did a jump crash!

262
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,630
- [Jared] Yes, you did.

263
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,690
'Kay, are we ready?

264
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,419
We're all in our pajamas, we're all clean,

265
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:50,454
and we have a movie ready.

266
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:51,677
This is fun!

267
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:52,930
- We're gonna cuddle.

268
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,513
Last night, Dad didn't
get to watch a movie.

269
00:09:54,513 --> 00:09:55,410
- [Jared] Yup.

270
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,420
- He was trying to find a
bajillion places for internet.

271
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,910
- Yeah, having internet is important,

272
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:02,432
and uploading videos is
important, and we finally

273
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:03,847
got fast internet.
- [Ellie] Ah, Calvin!

274
00:10:03,847 --> 00:10:05,249
You dropped half of 'em, you turd!

275
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:06,082
- [Jared] Oh no!

276
00:10:06,082 --> 00:10:07,143
Party foul.

277
00:10:07,143 --> 00:10:08,970
- You just dropped 'em, eat it!

278
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,188
- [Jared] You guys ready
to watch this movie?

279
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,550
- So Dad's gonna watch a movie with us.

280
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,845
- [Jared] Yeah, let's do it!

281
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,600
- Uh uh, oh oh!

282
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,524
- Excuse me, young man.

283
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,293
- (chuckling) He thinks this is his.

284
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,110
- [Jared] Yeah, that is my spot.

285
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,467
I'm cuddling next to Mom.

286
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:23,030
- [Ellie] And this is my pillow!

287
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,767
- [Jared] Hey. (imitating punching sounds)

288
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:29,160
- Hey, Dad, I saved you a small spot.

289
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,235
- [Jared] Oh thank you so much.

290
00:10:30,235 --> 00:10:31,150
- [Ellie] Next to--

291
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:33,031
- A sliver next to you.

292
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,864
Shh.

293
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,964
Hey! What are you guys doing?

294
00:10:40,964 --> 00:10:42,610
- We're playing dogs.

295
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,050
- [Jared] You're playing dogs?

296
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:45,120
What kind of dogs?

297
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,953
Penny dogs?

298
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:50,086
- No! Little dog. (imitates dog bark)

299
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:51,330
- [Jared] Little dog? (chuckles)

300
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,769
Are you guys having a good night?

301
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:53,602
- Yeah.

302
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:54,445
- [Jared] Have you had fun on our trip?

303
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,670
- Yeah!

304
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,381
- [Jared] Good. What's
been your favorite part?

305
00:10:57,381 --> 00:10:58,230
- Swimming.

306
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,200
- [Jared] Swimming was
a lot of fun, wasn't it?

307
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,528
Calvin, did you have a favorite part?

308
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:02,750
- Um, mn-mm.

309
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,080
- [Jared] No? (laughs)

310
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,203
Okay, pills!

311
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:07,631
- The lights.

312
00:11:07,631 --> 00:11:08,464
- [Jared] The lights?

313
00:11:08,464 --> 00:11:09,297
- Uh-huh.

314
00:11:09,297 --> 00:11:11,447
- He liked the lights.

315
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:12,930
- [Ellie, Jared] Oh.

316
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,501
- [Jared] Cool, the lights, huh?

317
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,180
If you guys don't remember, every time

318
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,291
we do a camping trip or
something, we take the little,

319
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,930
the polaroid, and we have our little book.

320
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,074
Here, let me show ya real quick.

321
00:11:23,074 --> 00:11:24,240
- [Ellie] Uh, don't show the first one.

322
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,441
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

323
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,210
(shudders) If you guys
remember, our first trip

324
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,580
didn't go the smoothest.

325
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,813
- We were sick, and I was
in the bathroom, ha ha!

326
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:32,080
- Yep, okay.

327
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,830
So every trip we have taken polaroids,

328
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,440
and then this one was
from the solar eclipse,

329
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,020
and this one was this morning.

330
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,720
We had to leave Penny
out, because she kept

331
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,650
trying to get the food.

332
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,506
So that is our fun adventure.

333
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:46,655
And you guys just got a new polaroid.

334
00:11:46,655 --> 00:11:49,752
- 'Kay, you were a stinker,
and got wasn't in it.

335
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,280
- [Jared] (laughs) Hey
boys, can you say goodnight

336
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,113
to our friends?

337
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:53,946
- Goodnight.

338
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:54,779
- [Ellie] Do you wanna
take one of Daddy and I?

339
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:56,260
- [Jared] Night. Yeah, take one of us.

340
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,093
'Kay, ready?

341
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:57,990
- [Ellie] No, me, us.

342
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,823
- [Jared] Take it of us.

343
00:11:58,823 --> 00:11:59,657
Point it down.

344
00:11:59,657 --> 00:12:00,490
(camera clicks)

345
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:01,993
Oh! (Jared and Ellie laugh)

346
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:04,250
We'll see how that works.
- It'll be a good one.

347
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,470
We'll keep it.

348
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,530
- We will keep it.

349
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,320
All right, that is gonna be it from us

350
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,320
on our quick, little, fun getaway.

351
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,880
Thank you guys so much for watching.

352
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,878
We're anxious to use this little trailer

353
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:18,570
more and more throughout
this year and years to come.

354
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,430
And we will see you guys next time,

355
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,972
as we drive all the way back home.

356
00:12:23,972 --> 00:12:25,055
Bye.

357
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:26,611
Quick bonus clip!

358
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:28,243
There's the one we just took of Jackson.

359
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:30,943
- [Ellie] It's coming,
and it's both of us.

360
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:31,776
- [Jared] Oh, cute!

361
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:33,457
You got our faces, Jackson, good job!

362
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:35,170
- And I think he just
took one of Calvin's head,

363
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,003
let's see how--

364
00:12:36,003 --> 00:12:37,245
- [Calvin] That Jack!

365
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:38,186
- [Jared] Yeah, that is Jack.

366
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,436
Starting to go.

367
00:12:40,850 --> 00:00:00,000
'Kay, see you guys!
