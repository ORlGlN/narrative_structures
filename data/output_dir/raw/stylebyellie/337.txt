1
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:02,543
- [Ellie] He stepped over it!

2
00:00:02,543 --> 00:00:04,126
He stepped over it!

3
00:00:05,226 --> 00:00:08,559
- [Jared] Get back up, son, get back up!

4
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:16,858
- [Ellie] So, does this
mean we're gonna have

5
00:00:16,858 --> 00:00:19,346
a ton of eggs for breakfast?

6
00:00:19,346 --> 00:00:20,179
- [Jared] Yes.

7
00:00:20,179 --> 00:00:21,012
- [Ellie] Good morning.

8
00:00:21,012 --> 00:00:23,038
Happy Easter weekend!

9
00:00:23,038 --> 00:00:24,657
- Happy Easter weekend to you guys.

10
00:00:24,657 --> 00:00:26,311
- [Ellie] We are getting
ready to do something fun

11
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,408
with the kids later, so
we are gonna use that

12
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:31,237
to have scrambled eggs.

13
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:32,589
- Lots of them, so I hope you're hungry.

14
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:36,973
- I got ready today and I feel
a little out of my element.

15
00:00:36,973 --> 00:00:38,599
I think these are so cute on other people

16
00:00:38,599 --> 00:00:40,927
but I don't know how it looks
or if I'm wearing it right.

17
00:00:40,927 --> 00:00:42,446
- I think it looks adorable on you.

18
00:00:42,446 --> 00:00:43,279
I really do.

19
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,266
I like your bun, and I like your buns.

20
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,322
- Thank you, but this is my outfit.

21
00:00:47,322 --> 00:00:48,915
We're getting ready to
do an Easter egg hunt.

22
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,841
We've got the kids' outfits ready.

23
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:52,498
They're wearing bugs today.

24
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:54,207
Are you excited to wear bugs?

25
00:00:54,207 --> 00:00:56,178
My little super heroes.

26
00:00:56,178 --> 00:00:57,078
- There they are.

27
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:57,911
- [Jared] There they are.

28
00:00:57,911 --> 00:00:59,157
Do you see all the people coming over?

29
00:00:59,157 --> 00:01:00,100
- [Jackson] Yeah.

30
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,818
- There are tons of
people here at the park,

31
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:03,564
which is a good thing
because when we drove up,

32
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:06,226
we were just like, "There's no one here."

33
00:01:06,226 --> 00:01:08,385
And we were looking at the
wrong entrance of the park.

34
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:11,376
So, we've got our buckets and we are ready

35
00:01:11,376 --> 00:01:12,504
to go find some eggs.

36
00:01:12,504 --> 00:01:13,521
Are you ready to rock and roll?

37
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:14,354
- Yeah.

38
00:01:14,354 --> 00:01:15,283
- Can you show them your bucket, Jacks?

39
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,527
- [Jared] Yeah, who's on your bucket?

40
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:17,379
- Uh, Spiderman.

41
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,068
- Spiderman, and then
Calvin has Ninja Turtles.

42
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:22,649
Calvin is just waking up.

43
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,062
You ready to go find some eggs?

44
00:01:25,062 --> 00:01:25,895
- Yeah.

45
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:30,693
- You know, I remember
doing Easter egg hunts

46
00:01:30,693 --> 00:01:33,063
and I remember one year, we
did it, the church had one,

47
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:36,118
so we did it and I
remember the lady was like,

48
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:37,629
"You can only grab three."

49
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,911
and I was like, "What?"

50
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:41,862
and everyone was grabbing
tons and I just grabbed three

51
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:42,928
and I was so sad.

52
00:01:42,928 --> 00:01:45,897
I told my mom and my mom's
like, "Who told you that?"

53
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,184
and then I told her and she's like,

54
00:01:47,184 --> 00:01:48,295
"You should've grabbed more."

55
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:50,061
(Jared laughs)

56
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:51,080
Trying to be, you know.

57
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,903
- Yeah, trying to make
sure everyone gets one

58
00:01:53,903 --> 00:01:55,135
and then you were being a good kid.

59
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:55,986
- But no one did.

60
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:57,004
They all just grabbed tons.

61
00:01:57,004 --> 00:01:57,837
- They're all just ignoring it.

62
00:01:57,837 --> 00:01:58,920
That's funny.

63
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,800
Little does he know that

64
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,477
this week we're going to Disneyland.

65
00:02:09,477 --> 00:02:12,008
Say, "Oh boy, Mickey Mouse."

66
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,895
(inaudible)

67
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:16,478
(Jared laughs)

68
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:20,691
Jackson, your head went
all the way through.

69
00:02:20,691 --> 00:02:22,415
Can you get it back out?

70
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:23,642
Is your head stuck?

71
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:24,475
- No.

72
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:25,308
- [Jared] Okay.

73
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:26,144
- [Ellie] Let's put Calvin in there.

74
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:27,356
- Let's let Calvin try, okay.

75
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,444
Hop on out.

76
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:29,520
Calvin, come say hi.

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,517
Say hi to me.

78
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,545
Hi.

79
00:02:31,545 --> 00:02:32,628
There you go.

80
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:35,055
So, this is a pretty cool thing.

81
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,315
They've got it divided up into age groups,

82
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:41,505
so this field right here is
for three and four year olds.

83
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:44,674
That field over there is
for zero to two year olds.

84
00:02:44,674 --> 00:02:46,675
So, Calvin and I are
going to tackle that field

85
00:02:46,675 --> 00:02:48,542
and Ellie and Jackson are
going to tackle this one.

86
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:49,584
- I bet they would let them go together.

87
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:50,417
- [Jared] I think so.

88
00:02:50,417 --> 00:02:51,250
- Do you want them to go together?

89
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,083
- Well, I don't know.

90
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,084
We can do it either way.

91
00:02:53,084 --> 00:02:54,383
- We'll stick with age groups.

92
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:55,238
There's more over there.

93
00:02:55,238 --> 00:02:56,351
Calvin'll like it.

94
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,798
You can go with Cal, I'll stay with Jacks.

95
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:59,392
- [Jared] Alright, Jackson.

96
00:02:59,392 --> 00:03:00,861
Now, tell me what you gotta do?

97
00:03:00,861 --> 00:03:02,211
Okay, what do you need to do?

98
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:04,405
When you see an egg, what do you do boys?

99
00:03:04,405 --> 00:03:05,505
- Go fast.

100
00:03:05,505 --> 00:03:07,627
- [Jared] You run fast to
it and then what do you do?

101
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,107
- Put them

102
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:10,476
- [Jared] Put it in your bucket.

103
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:11,724
Right, Calvin?

104
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:13,869
You see an egg and you put
it in your bucket, okay.

105
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:14,702
- Yeah.

106
00:03:14,702 --> 00:03:15,728
- [Jared] Now only eggs on the ground.

107
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:17,684
We don't take eggs from
other people, okay?

108
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:18,517
- Okay.

109
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,184
- [Jared] Good boys.

110
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:27,566
These kids are doing so good at waiting.

111
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:29,523
They're literally, look
at him inch-worming.

112
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:32,120
Look at him inch-worming.

113
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,445
There are so many eggs
out there just waiting

114
00:03:34,445 --> 00:03:35,481
and they see them.

115
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,743
Like, they know they're right there

116
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,844
and they're just good to wait.

117
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:43,448
Seven, six, five, ready,
get ready, here we go.

118
00:03:43,448 --> 00:03:45,697
Go, run, run, run, run, run!

119
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,947
Go Calvin, go get the eggs!

120
00:03:55,227 --> 00:03:57,573
- [Ellie] He stepped over
it, he stepped over it.

121
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,121
(Jared laughs)

122
00:03:59,121 --> 00:04:02,454
- [Jared] Get back up, son, get back up.

123
00:04:06,317 --> 00:04:08,328
He missed the ones right in front of him.

124
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:12,328
Oh, I guess we're supposed
to run out with them.

125
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:16,690
Oh my gosh.

126
00:04:18,516 --> 00:04:19,849
Go, Jackson, go.

127
00:04:28,846 --> 00:04:31,546
(Jared laughs)

128
00:04:31,546 --> 00:04:33,687
Did you find an egg, buddy?

129
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:34,992
Oh, you're already eating it.

130
00:04:34,992 --> 00:04:37,632
Wow, you don't waste any time, do you?

131
00:04:37,632 --> 00:04:39,497
Are you excited to show Jackson?

132
00:04:39,497 --> 00:04:41,802
I bet Jackson's excited to show you.

133
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:42,910
- [Calvin] I got four.

134
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,121
- [Ellie] You got four eggs?

135
00:04:44,121 --> 00:04:46,524
You got one, should we count them?

136
00:04:46,524 --> 00:04:49,983
Two, three, four, five, six eggs!

137
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:51,059
This must be special.

138
00:04:51,059 --> 00:04:52,480
It's tied shut.

139
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,975
- [Jared] Six eggs?

140
00:04:53,975 --> 00:04:55,254
- [Ellie] This one must be special.

141
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,416
It's tied shut.

142
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,483
- [Jared] Ooo.

143
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:58,879
- [Ellie] Alright, so before we go play,

144
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,897
there's one special egg that's taped

145
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,147
and I think we're gonna
have Jackson open it

146
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:04,642
before we go play.

147
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:05,475
Oh, maybe not.

148
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:08,642
Maybe it just has lots of candy in it.

149
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,130
- [Jared] Whoah!

150
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,205
- [Ellie] Does it just have lots of candy?

151
00:05:13,205 --> 00:05:15,144
Wow, that's cool.

152
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:17,026
Should we go play at the park now?

153
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,674
- Yeah, let's go to the slide park.

154
00:05:18,674 --> 00:05:19,716
- [Jared] Let's go to the slide park.

155
00:05:19,716 --> 00:05:20,549
Is there anything in it?

156
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:21,588
Open it up.

157
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:22,421
- Yeah!

158
00:05:23,312 --> 00:05:24,971
- [Jared] That's a good little treat.

159
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:26,054
- Oh my gosh.

160
00:05:27,006 --> 00:05:27,996
- [Jared] What is it?

161
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,290
- Candy!

162
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,540
- [Jared] Yeah!

163
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:35,118
(mellow guitar music)

164
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,911
- We put the kids down for quiet time

165
00:06:06,911 --> 00:06:09,266
and Ellie is making something good.

166
00:06:09,266 --> 00:06:10,099
What are you making?

167
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:13,141
- Well, so church is late tomorrow for us.

168
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:15,002
Like, we get home really
late so I'm making

169
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:19,169
as much as I can today so we
can just come home and eat.

170
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,015
- Right.

171
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:22,019
It's a good time to do things

172
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:23,718
while kids are having quiet time.

173
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,159
Ellie's cooking and I'm getting ready

174
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,002
for our next Easter activity.

175
00:06:27,002 --> 00:06:29,822
You saw this morning, I was
hollowing out a bunch of eggs

176
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,954
and I have a bunch of paint
and so I'm working on that

177
00:06:32,954 --> 00:06:36,125
right now and I've also got
some colored tissue paper.

178
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:38,835
So, we're gonna fill the eggs with paint

179
00:06:38,835 --> 00:06:40,017
and then you'll see what happens next.

180
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:40,850
It's gonna be really cool.

181
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,600
I'm excited about it.

182
00:07:14,957 --> 00:07:17,168
Alright, I have one box
of eggs all the way done

183
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:18,368
and I wanna show you what it looks like

184
00:07:18,368 --> 00:07:20,079
'cause I think it looks pretty cool.

185
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,021
I think I'm pretty crafty right now.

186
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,240
Take a look at these.

187
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,052
So, the tissue paper
just covers up the paint,

188
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:28,058
so it doesn't spill as
much as it possibly could

189
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:30,884
and identifies what color
of paint is in there.

190
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:35,367
So, we've got white, green,
blue, purple, yellow, and red

191
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:39,269
and the idea is to throw the
white ones after the color ones

192
00:07:39,269 --> 00:07:41,603
are on there because
we're using white canvas.

193
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:42,950
Oh, wait, I didn't even tell you.

194
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,859
If you guys couldn't guess
already, what we're doing is

195
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:47,528
we're taking these eggs and
we're throwing them on canvas

196
00:07:47,528 --> 00:07:48,726
to make like a painting.

197
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:49,700
So, that's the surprise.

198
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,533
I ruined it.

199
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:51,506
Shoot.

200
00:07:51,506 --> 00:07:52,578
Anyway, it's still fun.

201
00:07:52,578 --> 00:07:55,887
Jackson, come tell me what
colors you see in these paints.

202
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:56,720
- Green,

203
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:59,031
blue,

204
00:07:59,031 --> 00:07:59,864
purple,

205
00:08:01,118 --> 00:08:01,951
white,

206
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:03,819
yellow,

207
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,942
red.

208
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:07,775
- [Jared] Cool.

209
00:08:07,775 --> 00:08:09,310
We're gonna do something
really fun with these, okay,

210
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,956
but I want you guys to go
back downstairs for quiet time

211
00:08:11,956 --> 00:08:13,674
so it's more of a surprise, okay.

212
00:08:13,674 --> 00:08:14,684
Can you do that?

213
00:08:14,684 --> 00:08:16,239
Look at you sneaking that chair over,

214
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,703
trying to get up here too.

215
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:18,935
Okay, so, let's go back downstairs

216
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,768
so we can have this be a surprise.

217
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,244
- I washed my hands, just so you know.

218
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:31,558
- [Jared] Oh, I know you did.

219
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:32,391
I didn't.

220
00:08:33,248 --> 00:08:34,693
- [Ellie] This is one
of the things I made.

221
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,734
It's broccoli corn casserole.

222
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:37,962
We won't eat all of this stuff now

223
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,206
but we have to save it for tomorrow

224
00:08:39,206 --> 00:08:41,573
but we also don't wanna
waste a food that we have

225
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:44,139
in our fridge 'cause we're
leaving for our trip on Monday

226
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,329
so this is what I was able
to pull out of our fridge

227
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,706
to come up with as an afternoon snack

228
00:08:48,706 --> 00:08:50,767
to get us by until dinner.

229
00:08:50,767 --> 00:08:52,840
Celery, peanut butter, strawberries,

230
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,755
zucchini with some salt and
pepper on it that I grilled

231
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:58,068
and the kids just got done eating

232
00:08:58,068 --> 00:09:00,754
and they had a bunch of
yogurt but I'm cleaning up.

233
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:02,329
Of course, Calvin, he won't eat fruit.

234
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,204
He ate everything else but not the fruit.

235
00:09:04,204 --> 00:09:05,476
So, there is that.

236
00:09:05,476 --> 00:09:08,678
I just put the kids in
their own rooms now.

237
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:11,452
Jackson will not fall asleep
but I gave him two toys

238
00:09:11,452 --> 00:09:13,225
and said, "Okay, stay here
for like ten more minutes

239
00:09:13,225 --> 00:09:14,058
"while I clean up."

240
00:09:14,058 --> 00:09:15,186
So, I have all these toys.

241
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,671
Calvin's down for a nap.

242
00:09:16,671 --> 00:09:18,086
Did I just say toys?

243
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,175
You know what I meant.

244
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,938
I'm going to clean up and then
I will finish taking care of

245
00:09:21,938 --> 00:09:23,433
and playing with the kids.

246
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:24,266
My eyes.

247
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:26,222
I need to open them up and wake up.

248
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,542
- Oh, shucks, well Grandma
and Grandpa have come over

249
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,754
and they have something for the boys.

250
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:33,230
- What do we have here?

251
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,248
- [Jared] Whoah.

252
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:37,267
- This is for, what is your name?

253
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:38,100
- Jackson.

254
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,396
- Jackson.

255
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,896
This is for Daddy.

256
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,180
This is for Ellie.

257
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,013
- Thank you.

258
00:09:45,013 --> 00:09:45,846
We love these.

259
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:48,000
- And who is this for?

260
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,833
- Calvin.

261
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:49,666
- Calvin.

262
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,094
Looks, this goes with it.

263
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:52,846
- [Jackson] It's a hello car.

264
00:09:52,846 --> 00:09:53,944
Look, it's a hello car.

265
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,091
- [Jared] Penny, do you
want a little bite of it.

266
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:56,930
- It's a Laffy Taffy car.

267
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,144
- Oh my goodness.

268
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:03,427
Your favorite candy and your favorite toy.

269
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:04,960
What's up doc?

270
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,793
Thanks guys.

271
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:06,626
That's sweet of you.

272
00:10:06,626 --> 00:10:08,420
These are really clever, huh.

273
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,764
They look like carrots.

274
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:13,966
- So, Jared is getting set up
and I thought that this year,

275
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:17,708
it would be fun, rather
than dying Easter eggs,

276
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,536
to I saw on Pinterest,
for toddlers that you fill

277
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,422
the eggs up with paint and you throw them

278
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:25,073
and it makes something kind of cute.

279
00:10:25,073 --> 00:10:27,026
So, I thought that would
be a little more fun than,

280
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:29,520
you know, messing with dying the eggs.

281
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,464
- Get the hands.

282
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,527
- I mean, I remember doing
that last year and it was like

283
00:10:32,527 --> 00:10:34,156
they were really still kind of little.

284
00:10:34,156 --> 00:10:37,525
So, I think they'll have
more fun throwing it.

285
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:41,047
- So, we each can throw nine eggs.

286
00:10:41,047 --> 00:10:41,880
Now, hold on.

287
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,288
Whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah, whoah.

288
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,950
These are eggs, so they're breakable.

289
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,226
Now, the tissue paper
is what color this is.

290
00:10:48,226 --> 00:10:52,432
So, we have red, blue, purple,
green, yellow, and white.

291
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:53,891
Jackson, you're gonna go
first and you're gonna take

292
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,506
pick one at a time.

293
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:57,018
- I want blue.

294
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:59,462
- Okay, so pick up a blue one.

295
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:01,785
And now throw it at the canvas.

296
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,592
(cheering)

297
00:11:04,592 --> 00:11:07,175
(upbeat music)

298
00:11:14,316 --> 00:11:17,161
- [Ellie] That's awesome.

299
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:19,744
(upbeat music)

300
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:30,133
- [Ellie] Was that fun?

301
00:11:30,133 --> 00:11:30,966
- Yeah.

302
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:31,799
I wanna try another one.

303
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:32,632
- [Ellie] You wanna try another one?

304
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,134
You know what, I think you can
have one of my eggs and throw

305
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,884
so you each get nine.

306
00:11:36,742 --> 00:11:38,168
I'll give you one of mine.

307
00:11:38,168 --> 00:11:39,070
Do you wanna do one more?

308
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:39,903
- Yeah.

309
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,068
- [Ellie] That is so cute, actually.

310
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,077
- [Jared] Right there.

311
00:11:48,077 --> 00:11:49,219
Throw it.

312
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,469
(cheering)

313
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,646
- [Ellie] I think those are cute.

314
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:01,649
- [Jared] Oh, he's finger painting.

315
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:02,511
- [Ellie] That's cute.

316
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:04,484
- [Jared] Good job.

317
00:12:04,484 --> 00:12:05,725
Look at him go.

318
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,921
I'm much more civilized
than the throw painting.

319
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:11,011
I'm a finger painter.

320
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:12,928
Professional, by trade.

321
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,799
(upbeat music)

322
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:24,272
Our turn?

323
00:12:29,864 --> 00:12:32,652
I gave it all I had, too.

324
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,152
- [Ellie] Awesome.

325
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,962
This is a kids washable
paint so we'll all jump

326
00:12:48,962 --> 00:12:52,879
in the bathtub when we're
done, or the hot tub.

327
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:06,491
I'm gonna try and do
mine a little different.

328
00:13:08,984 --> 00:13:11,251
Well, that's not how
I thought it would be.

329
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:12,308
I'll just throw it, then.

330
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,474
I was gonna try and do white in the middle

331
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:14,403
and the colored around.

332
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:15,994
- [Jared] Oh, that's a good idea.

333
00:13:15,994 --> 00:13:18,161
For the windup, go for it.

334
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,627
(laughs)

335
00:13:24,672 --> 00:13:27,530
Yeah, that purple looks great.

336
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,613
(laughs)

337
00:13:33,532 --> 00:13:34,365
Mom!

338
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:40,093
You got it right in the face!

339
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:41,158
Ellie!

340
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:42,221
We've got a man down.

341
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,704
We got a man down.

342
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:44,807
Calvin looks like Two-Face.

343
00:13:44,807 --> 00:13:46,092
Calvin, look at me.

344
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:46,925
Calvin.

345
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:49,789
You guys.

346
00:13:51,544 --> 00:13:53,127
What are you doing?

347
00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:55,952
Oh, you boys.

348
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:10,526
- I like everyone else's.

349
00:14:10,526 --> 00:14:12,354
You guys all did an A plus.

350
00:14:12,354 --> 00:14:13,706
- [Jared] See if you can find a blue one.

351
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:14,539
- Or the green.

352
00:14:14,539 --> 00:14:15,372
That would be cool.

353
00:14:15,372 --> 00:14:17,078
There's like no green on there.

354
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:17,988
- [Jared] There you go.

355
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,988
That's a little variety.

356
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:23,591
- [Ellie] Tradition.

357
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,708
You silly.

358
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,541
You silly.

359
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:32,354
- [Jared] Did I tell
you this is permanent?

360
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,854
So, here is the aftermath of all the eggs.

361
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:40,606
I think more paint got on the
ground than on the paintings.

362
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:42,621
- Jackson and Calvin.

363
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:44,519
- [Jared] Jackson right
there, Calvin right there.

364
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,352
- Momma.

365
00:14:47,037 --> 00:14:48,732
- [Jared] They did way
better than we did, Ellie.

366
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:49,565
- I know!

367
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:50,434
I'm disappointed.

368
00:14:50,434 --> 00:14:51,267
And Jared.

369
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,558
- [Jared] And then mine.

370
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,360
Those are so fun, don't you think?

371
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,638
- [Ellie] We're totally
doing this every year.

372
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:57,810
- [Jared] That's awesome.

373
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:58,964
What a fun new tradition.

374
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:00,365
- Love it!

375
00:15:00,365 --> 00:15:01,748
- [Jared] It's a messy
one but it's a fun one.

376
00:15:01,748 --> 00:15:02,581
- I think it's cute.

377
00:15:02,581 --> 00:15:05,000
I was disappointed in mine
but now I kinda like it.

378
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,534
- It is pretty cool, huh.

379
00:15:06,534 --> 00:15:08,531
If you guys are interested,
we will be selling these

380
00:15:08,531 --> 00:15:10,081
on our website.

381
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,021
We'll link 'em down below.

382
00:15:11,021 --> 00:15:13,688
Probably starting at 99, 99, 99.

383
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,924
- But if you buy in the next 30 minutes,

384
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:20,329
we will include two
more for the same price.

385
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:22,563
- So, they can be yours for the price,

386
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:24,019
or we could do auction.

387
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,352
We'll do auction starting at 99, 99, 99.

388
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:32,112
Did you boys have so
much fun throwing eggs?

389
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:33,930
Was that like crazy cool?

390
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,663
Well, the hot tub is calling
our name and guess what boys?

391
00:15:36,663 --> 00:15:38,975
We have a friend waiting
for us in the hot tub.

392
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,492
We've got a friend.

393
00:15:40,492 --> 00:15:41,338
You're about to see.

394
00:15:41,338 --> 00:15:42,745
Let's go sit in the hot tub.

395
00:15:42,745 --> 00:15:44,976
- I totally forgot about the (inaudible)

396
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,115
- [Jared] Yeah, you guys ready?

397
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:46,991
Penny, you guys are gonna come with it.

398
00:15:46,991 --> 00:15:48,085
Let's go.

399
00:15:48,085 --> 00:15:50,502
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

400
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,719
This is our new friend and
Jackson's about to get on him.

401
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:55,780
What do you think?

402
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,280
- [Ellie] Okay, hold on tight.

403
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:06,772
That's amazing, it holds you up.

404
00:16:08,663 --> 00:16:11,246
(upbeat music)

405
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,374
- Ugh, oh geez.

406
00:16:33,374 --> 00:16:36,176
Did you guys enjoy that ride?

407
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:37,650
Can you even see?

408
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,908
Penny got a hold of you,

409
00:16:38,908 --> 00:16:41,324
took you on a little ride up in the dirt.

410
00:16:41,324 --> 00:16:43,390
Back to the hot tub!

411
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,890
Okay, catch Ellie.

412
00:16:47,243 --> 00:16:49,723
- Hey, guys, we are ready for bed

413
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:51,788
and I have something sad to tell you.

414
00:16:51,788 --> 00:16:54,130
I'm no longer in a blue robe.

415
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,515
That's kind of sad, honestly.

416
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,803
I was really.

417
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:57,934
- [Jared] How many vlogs have we been in

418
00:16:57,934 --> 00:16:58,785
with your blue robe?

419
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,991
- I've been in a lot of
vlogs with that blue robe.

420
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,499
Jared got it for me for
Christmas several years ago

421
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,152
and I loved it and it was so soft

422
00:17:05,152 --> 00:17:08,395
but it had gone through
a lot of things, so.

423
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:09,656
- [Jared] It's seen it's better days.

424
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:10,685
- It's seen it's better days,

425
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:12,058
so now welcome the pink Ellie robe.

426
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,305
Pink is my favorite color, so.

427
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:15,368
Thank you guys so much for watching.

428
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,903
We had a wonderful day with the kids.

429
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:19,935
We always do but today was extra fun.

430
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,610
Just lots of activities.

431
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,503
- Fun laughs and smiles.

432
00:17:23,503 --> 00:17:25,789
- The painting, we need to do a lot more.

433
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,003
The kids loved that.

434
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,740
Tomorrow I'm really
excited to go to church.

435
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,189
It's Easter Sunday.

436
00:17:30,189 --> 00:17:31,977
We're gonna have a really fun
Easter egg hunt at your mom's

437
00:17:31,977 --> 00:17:34,006
in the morning, we'll have
breakfast and do that.

438
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:34,839
- It's gonna be a great,

439
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:36,505
and then it's the beginning
of a great new week

440
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:37,500
and we're very excited.

441
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,215
- Birthday week!

442
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,499
