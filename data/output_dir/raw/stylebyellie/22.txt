1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,700
- How do you cut the boys' hair?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,990
- Hey, little baby,
you're like a grapefruit.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,169
- [Ellie] Well do you like your dog

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:08,394
or do you like Penny dog?

5
00:00:08,394 --> 00:00:09,234
- Tiny dog.

6
00:00:09,234 --> 00:00:10,650
- [Ellie] Tiny dog he says.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,750
- We have made a monumental announcement.

8
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:15,800
Now this one's pretty heavy, okay,

9
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,120
so let's try it and do it slow.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,120
- No big.

11
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,750
- You want, you want a lot?

12
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,690
Kay, let's lift it up,
we're gonna tilt it.

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:26,130
Slowly.

14
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,799
Good job.
- Big!

15
00:00:27,799 --> 00:00:29,299
- Yeah. It is big.

16
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,610
What do you wanna twist it?

17
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,250
Look, you are such a good helper.

18
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,904
Good morning bud.

19
00:00:35,904 --> 00:00:36,830
- Good morning dad.

20
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,843
- I love you.

21
00:00:38,843 --> 00:00:40,390
- [Jared] I know you love me.

22
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,933
- You're such Han Solo.

23
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:44,950
Good morning dad.

24
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,990
I love you.

25
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,180
I know you love me.

26
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,180
- Over on my other channel
you guys have seen that

27
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,370
Bonnie and I have put out a makeup video

28
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,450
and a writing our diaries video.

29
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,140
And as I was getting
ready today I was like

30
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,290
I've gotta sit down and show
you guys what I've been doing

31
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,270
a little bit differently,
just the last like five days.

32
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,730
So I always use my Bobbi Brown
eye corrector under my eyes

33
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,690
and I've talked about this
Pure Hydrafluid before.

34
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,480
It's, to me it reminds me of
like a tinted moisturizer,

35
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,850
but it's extremely moisturizing,

36
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,950
that's why it's like a Hydrafluid.

37
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,200
I usually don't wear this alone.

38
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,390
I just will mix it in with the foundation

39
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,120
if I wanna make it a little darker.

40
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,280
So I picked up the shade light

41
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,910
and it still is not as
light as I'd like it.

42
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:28,220
But, I've been using this little bit.

43
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,320
Still my eyebrows, mascara, and blush,

44
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,440
and that's what I've been using.

45
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,100
But I just want to show the applying this,

46
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,720
because I've talked about it so much

47
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,240
but I've been wearing it on it's own, so.

48
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,200
Let's get ready guys.

49
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,010
I always shake it really well.

50
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,190
And it seriously is so dark.

51
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,750
Like, this is the medium,
and that's what I usually mix

52
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,970
to make my foundation a little darker.

53
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,320
But even the light is very dark.

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,040
I've had a lot of, like,
pregnancy hormones been going on

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,090
and this whole pregnancy if I get acne,

56
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,540
I've been getting a lot
of acne above my lip,

57
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,550
which has kinda been weird.

58
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,150
But I just put a little dot.

59
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,710
That's even way too much.

60
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,820
So I'm gonna touch one side of my face

61
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,990
and then I'm gonna do the other.

62
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,810
Rub it all in and it literally
is like a tinted moisturizer,

63
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,780
it's not gonna really cover my acne.

64
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,640
Can you hear my voice?

65
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,980
I like just woke up.

66
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,230
I'm like groggy still.

67
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,897
(playful music)

68
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,990
And that is just my
foundation, like I said

69
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,590
I wish it was a hair lighter
but just to give my skin

70
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,420
an even complexion that's
what I've been wearing

71
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,480
'cause it's super fast in the mornings,

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,930
just on days where I don't really wanna

73
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,870
like really get ready I just want

74
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,500
a little color and mascara
and I'm good to go.

75
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,560
This is what I've been
using and I love it.

76
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,437
But if I could have them
make a lighter shade

77
00:02:41,437 --> 00:02:44,940
like a fainter shade,
that would be the best.

78
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,750
And I have a hard time
with tinted moisturizers.

79
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,440
Like the in-cosmetics has probably

80
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,600
been my favorite tinted moisturizer,

81
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,880
but sometimes I feel like it just

82
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,440
sits on the surface of my skin

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,597
so like when I touch or the
kids touch it like smears off

84
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:59,250
or it just doesn't blend
but this it like literally

85
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,410
is like lotion in a way.

86
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,920
And it like just blends into your skin, so

87
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,100
I've really liked it, but yeah,

88
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,990
I'm gonna do my neck a little bit too

89
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,280
'cause it's really white.

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,113
Oh Jared!

91
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,393
Oh Jared!

92
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,120
Do you remember the first
few weeks of my pregnancy?

93
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,664
- Did you get yourself a cheese bagel?

94
00:03:20,664 --> 00:03:21,497
- [Ellie] Yeah.

95
00:03:21,497 --> 00:03:22,330
- And an orange juice?

96
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,690
- For, probably two or
three weeks in a row

97
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,420
Jared would go get me a freshly
squeezed juice with ginger

98
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,450
from Jamba Juice and then
he'd go get me a bagel.

99
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,380
And so today, in honor
of me being 23 weeks

100
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,828
I went and got us one, so we will

101
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:42,440
have a little breakfast together.

102
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,730
23 weeks!

103
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,540
- Are these weeks just like flying by?

104
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,030
- [Ellie] Holy crapola.

105
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,360
- You're more than halfway.

106
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,340
We're gonna have a baby in less time

107
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,380
than you've been pregnant so far.

108
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,745
- [Ellie] Baby's the size of a-

109
00:03:53,745 --> 00:03:54,578
- Orangutan!

110
00:03:54,578 --> 00:03:55,805
- [Ellie] No.

111
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:57,327
- A peacock!

112
00:03:57,327 --> 00:03:58,827
An Einstein bagel!

113
00:03:59,748 --> 00:04:02,784
- [Ellie] I had a brain fart, what is it?

114
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,610
It's a fruit, it's a fruit!

115
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,443
- Guava juice!

116
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:06,276
- [Ellie] No.

117
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,062
A grapefruit, a grapefruit!

118
00:04:08,062 --> 00:04:09,945
- A grapefruit?

119
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,000
Grapefruit's aren't that small.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,990
- Yeah, that's how big he is.

121
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,779
- Hey little baby,
you're like a grapefruit.

122
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:18,949
I hope he's not as sour as a grapefruit.

123
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,510
- [Ellie] Probably.

124
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,110
- My favorite color's blue.

125
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:25,372
- Mine is red.

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,500
- [Ellie] Your favorite color's red?

127
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,101
Penny what's your favorite color?

128
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:30,742
- [Jared] Yellow!

129
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:34,940
- Jackson passed off
more letters at school.

130
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,930
Good job Jackson!

131
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,660
So Jackson has passed off
all his uppercase letters

132
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
and now he's working on
his lowercase letters.

133
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,510
And I found the cutest little
craft that I wanna make

134
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,560
next week with him to
help him with his letters.

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,150
But today I think we're just
gonna hang out, and we are

136
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,769
what are we doing?

137
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:54,602
- Painting.

138
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:55,435
- [Ellie] Painting?

139
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,315
Do we have brushes?

140
00:04:56,315 --> 00:04:57,880
- [Jackson] No.

141
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,290
- [Ellie] What are we
gonna use to paint with?

142
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,450
- Our fingers.

143
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,730
- [Ellie] Okay.

144
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:03,480
Should you paint Calvin?

145
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,313
Do you wanna paint with your fingers?

146
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,570
Do you wanna paint with your paws Penny?

147
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,470
- It's red.

148
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,390
- [Ellie] Wow.

149
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,110
Well they each have a ton of colors,

150
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,210
but they're sticking with their favorites.

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,340
Jackson's sticking with his
blue, your heart looks awesome.

152
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,675
Calvin, you're sticking with red, huh?

153
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:24,735
- Put it on my face.

154
00:05:24,735 --> 00:05:25,902
- [Ellie] Kay.

155
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,810
It's a good thing about baths.

156
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:35,684
(Jackson and Calvin giggle)

157
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,920
Well I would say you guys
did a very good paint job.

158
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,910
Calvin loved red, that's
about all he used.

159
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,920
Spring is not coming anytime soon in Utah.

160
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,440
And it is cold, and it is snowy,

161
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,240
and the last few days I'm just like

162
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,700
I've got to think of some
things that we can do inside

163
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,316
that will entertain them
a little bit more than

164
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:02,460
they're pretty happy to go downstairs,

165
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,840
they're happy to play with cars,

166
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,350
they're happy to watch shows,

167
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:08,940
but I'm just like we've gotta
do a few things to make it-

168
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,490
wipe your hand?

169
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:13,440
Good luck, you need a whole bath.

170
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,270
But I was like I gotta
think of some things to do

171
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,140
just to like let them, like, be

172
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,520
and like do something other
than what they've been doing.

173
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,570
So today is painting and like I said

174
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:23,753
I found the cutest thing.

175
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:25,300
- [Calvin] Hey!

176
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,350
- [Ellie] He doesn't want
you coloring on his face.

177
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,540
This is like washable, like, fingerpaint.

178
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,450
So I'm not really concerned.

179
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,201
So the last time I cut the
kids hair I had some people ask

180
00:06:37,201 --> 00:06:38,880
how do you cut the boys' hair?

181
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,210
So I'm just gonna kinda like go through

182
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,590
and show you what I'm doing.

183
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,830
Oh 'cause and Calvin
doesn't like this on ever,

184
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,100
but I really need him to keep it on.

185
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,530
So, sometimes I offer shows,

186
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,740
sometimes I offer them to have suckers.

187
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,129
Really I don't care what they have

188
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,520
as long as they're sittin' still.

189
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,090
So, Calvin's here, I have never

190
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,520
used clippers on Calvin's hair.

191
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,460
I always use a comb and scissors

192
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,460
because Calvin's hair is so fine and thin.

193
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,780
Jackson's hair I've been using
clippers on his hair forever.

194
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,290
Jackson hasn't ever really
been scared of clippers

195
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,170
and I don't know if it's
because I introduced him

196
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,420
to clippers and haircuts
when he was six months old.

197
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,600
And Calvin has, whenever I cut his hair

198
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,220
I just hand cut around his whole head.

199
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,097
So with Calvin I get a cup
of hot water, I get a comb,

200
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:29,550
and I just sit here and I comb his hair

201
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,000
how I want it to lay.

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,590
So the front, I lay it down,

203
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,490
I'm trying to be soft 'cause
he has a scratch on his head.

204
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,130
And I just literally
just lay Calvin's hair

205
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,790
all the way down with a wet comb.

206
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:44,400
And Calvin is definitely not
as patient with his hair.

207
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,820
So I kinda have to work really fast.

208
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,390
With kids, you really only have

209
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,030
a few minutes to cut their hair.

210
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,810
So you have to work really fast.

211
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,520
I start around, I cut around his ears.

212
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,630
I cut his neckline because
he won't give me much time.

213
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,780
He'll be wiggly, and I wanna
get that done first thing

214
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,850
'cause that's like the
main part of the haircut

215
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,780
is to have the outer edge trimmed, for me.

216
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,130
So, that's where I just start.

217
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,560
Then I just try and distract them lots.

218
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,206
Calvin, what color is McQueen?

219
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:12,039
- Um, red!

220
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:12,872
- He's red?

221
00:08:12,872 --> 00:08:13,950
- No he's black and red.

222
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,479
- Oh is he black right now?

223
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:16,312
- Yeah.

224
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:17,490
- Is it a game or is it a show Calvin?

225
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,570
- Um, game.

226
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,657
- It's a game?

227
00:08:20,657 --> 00:08:21,490
- Mhmm.

228
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,323
- Oh.

229
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:23,156
- It's a show.

230
00:08:23,156 --> 00:08:25,490
- So I just sit and ask
a hundred questions,

231
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,720
especially while I'm going around his ear

232
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,180
'cause that keeps him quiet.

233
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,680
This is the best you've ever been Calvin.

234
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,680
I start by the ear, and I figure
how much I wanna take off.

235
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,630
Which is probably, like, a
little less than half an inch.

236
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,400
And I take this off around his whole head.

237
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,640
So, I grab all the hair around his ear,

238
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,390
and I just follow that and take it

239
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,790
all the way around his head.

240
00:08:52,727 --> 00:08:55,810
(funky upbeat music)

241
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,920
Okay, Calvin's getting super ansy,

242
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,130
so he is getting a sucker.

243
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,156
Do you wanna hold this?

244
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,363
- Mhmm.

245
00:09:03,363 --> 00:09:04,196
- Kay.

246
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,230
And now I get to move on
to the top of his hair.

247
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,750
Okay, who else is loving
the beard on Calvin's face?

248
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:14,830
Who loves that?

249
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,630
You look like a man!

250
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,300
So with Calvin, I went around his hair

251
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,153
and I just, with my fingers
up and down, did a half inch

252
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:25,420
all along the sides and
the back of his hair.

253
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,400
So now that we're to the
top I'm just gonna lift up

254
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,490
and this front section he has an owie,

255
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,240
so I'm trying to be really careful.

256
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,600
But I'm gonna lift it straight up

257
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,710
and I'm just gonna do a tiny tiny bit.

258
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,530
Because Calvin's hair
doesn't grow very fast,

259
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,810
'cause it's curly, and
I want the top longer.

260
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,700
So I'm just gonna do a tiny bit.

261
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,250
And I'm just gonna
follow all along the top

262
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,980
and do the same amount on the top.

263
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,920
Usually he's like screamin' by now

264
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,330
saying he wants to be done, so

265
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,910
it really depends on the day.

266
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:57,870
And I went to hair school,
so like I know what I'm doing

267
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,450
and I can work pretty fast.

268
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,460
But like, if you're at home doing this,

269
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,550
it might just take you a few
times to like, get going.

270
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,220
Don't feel discouraged.

271
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,100
But less is more, like don't go in

272
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,260
and just start choppin' hair
because then you're gonna like

273
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,950
chop all their hair off.

274
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,370
I would suggest investing in
some thinning shears as well.

275
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,540
Especially Calvin's
hair, where it's curly,

276
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,460
it tends to get really thick right here

277
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,540
and it's hard to look like it's blended.

278
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,210
So, just around between the blending part

279
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,840
of going on the sides
to the top of his hair.

280
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,410
Right here gets really thick.

281
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,830
So I'm gonna pull my scissors
up, and I'm just gonna like

282
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:40,280
thin this little area a little
bit so it's not so full.

283
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,810
Can you put your hand out and feel it?

284
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,346
- No!

285
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:44,179
- Will you do it right here?

286
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:45,363
- Yeah.

287
00:10:45,363 --> 00:10:47,220
- See, it doesn't hurt,
can you put your hand out?

288
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,368
We do this every time.

289
00:10:48,368 --> 00:10:49,824
Put your hand out.

290
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:51,160
Let's see your hand.

291
00:10:53,741 --> 00:10:54,574
Whoa.

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,336
Kay, can you look at your toessies?

293
00:10:58,336 --> 00:10:59,700
Then we'll be all done,

294
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,410
we'll go boom boom and it'll be done.

295
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:04,970
See, boom, one more look down.

296
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,580
At your toes and we'll be done.

297
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,252
One more time, good job.

298
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,085
Good job.

299
00:11:10,988 --> 00:11:15,820
Kay good job, see he gives me
two seconds to do his neck, so

300
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,680
I don't have much time to do it, so.

301
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,220
This is Calvin's hair.

302
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,780
You can see he does not
give me much time to do it.

303
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:25,120
He has natural wavy hair.

304
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,310
And I just scissor cut his hair.

305
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,600
Alright so Jackson's hair,

306
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
what I do is I use clippers on his hair,

307
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,440
and I use a number one on the sides

308
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,880
and then I just cut a
little bit off the top.

309
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,130
So with his hair, I like
to comb it all forward

310
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,360
and I like to figure out
where I like to part it.

311
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,450
'Cause that's usually about
where I bring the one up.

312
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,020
I bring it up just below that part

313
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,130
and I just kinda blend it to the part.

314
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,300
Some people like to bring it
all the way up to the part

315
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,120
and have it be a really harsh line.

316
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,622
I don't really love that as much, so

317
00:11:56,622 --> 00:11:59,751
I'm gonna find a line and part it off.

318
00:11:59,751 --> 00:12:03,670
(light playful music)

319
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,110
Alright so I just went with a number one

320
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,900
around Jackson's head.

321
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,840
So I'm gonna take my comb
and I'm gonna hold it

322
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,670
against his head and
I'm just gonna lift up

323
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,770
and it kinda stops where
those hairs stop and fall

324
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,660
and he has longer hairs and
that's what I'm gonna cut.

325
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,493
And I'm gonna keep doing that

326
00:12:20,493 --> 00:12:24,540
all the way up until it's
blended on his whole head.

327
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,960
It'll blend all of that.

328
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,460
Kay, so after I cut Jackson's
hair I try and blend it.

329
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,600
That's where my thinning
shears are my best friend.

330
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,930
I'm going to go up and
do the thinning shears

331
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,560
to make it blended even more.

332
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:42,670
Now that I've cut his sides

333
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,990
and I tried to blend it the best I can

334
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,830
I'm just gonna go on the top
and just kind of cut his hair.

335
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,930
(light playful music)

336
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:54,892
- I'm done.

337
00:12:54,892 --> 00:12:57,460
- [Ellie] This is Jackson's
hair with a number one up.

338
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,270
I tried to blend it to the part.

339
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,960
The top is cut a little bit.

340
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,100
- [Jared] Hey Jackson?

341
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,640
Will you take a picture of me and mommy?

342
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,473
- Sure.

343
00:13:04,473 --> 00:13:05,640
- Okay, come stand right here.

344
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,400
- [Ellie] We never ask
him to take a picture,

345
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,800
I think this is so cute.

346
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,810
- Just like that so you
can see mommy's belly.

347
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:12,080
And I'm gonna run in there too.

348
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,502
Just hit that big white button.

349
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:15,085
So, just like that.

350
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:17,787
Did you do it?

351
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:19,156
You wanna do it again?

352
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,170
Do it again.

353
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,259
Good job, let's see.

354
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,092
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

355
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,159
- Let's take a look.

356
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,085
(Jared laughs)

357
00:13:25,085 --> 00:13:27,100
- Dad I wanna see.

358
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,052
- [Ellie] Perfect Jackson.
- [Jared] Good job Jackson.

359
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:30,474
Oh there they go.

360
00:13:30,474 --> 00:13:31,390
- Oh cute.

361
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,240
- There ya go, here, he took a bunch.

362
00:13:34,226 --> 00:13:37,618
(light playful music)

363
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,368
(Calvin mumbles)

364
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,433
- I love when he gets down next to Penny.

365
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:50,040
He was like
"blah-la-lo-blee-la-lolo-bolo".

366
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,022
- [Ellie] But he is going to
get his dogs is what he said.

367
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:54,950
- Oh, I'm glad you're here to translate.

368
00:13:57,623 --> 00:13:59,100
- Ahh, wait.

369
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,731
- [Ellie] Go get your dog Penny.

370
00:14:00,731 --> 00:14:01,920
- [Jared] Drop it.
- [Ellie] Drop.

371
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,910
- Are you tryin' to show
her your favorite dog?

372
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,929
Well, do you like your dog
or do you like Penny dog?

373
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,511
- Tiny dog.

374
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:10,260
- [Jared] Tiny dog he said.

375
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:14,680
I have been M.I.A. Missing In
Action the entire day today.

376
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,130
Some of you may be cheering "Yes Jared!".

377
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,420
Some of you may be saying

378
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,100
"Oh no, Jared, where have you been?"

379
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,330
I have been in my office.

380
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,310
And, as of right now, you guys should know

381
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,400
that we have made a
monumental announcement

382
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,760
that we have a brand new
custom clothing line.

383
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,920
Bollie.

384
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
bolliebrand.com go check it out.

385
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,660
But right now, as I'm filming
this, it is not announced yet.

386
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,790
So, I wanna show you a little something

387
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,670
that I'm doing to get ready for this.

388
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:49,200
We're making teasers, all
before we make the announcement.

389
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,290
And right now I have been in my computer

390
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:55,190
creating particles for the announcement.

391
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,570
You can maybe be able to
see it move frame by frame.

392
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,930
This is just a quarter of the quality.

393
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,540
But that is going to be a
particle animation for a teaser.

394
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,700
And it's been going for about 20 minutes.

395
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,250
I don't know what it is with my computer,

396
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,230
but it's been acting really slow lately.

397
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,840
So, I hope it can handle all of this.

398
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,850
Handle all of the big stuff, but

399
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,850
I have been in my office
since seven this morning

400
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,830
and it is now 6:40 pm.

401
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:22,793
So I think I'm going to call
it quits here pretty soon

402
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:24,790
so I can be with my family.

403
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:27,830
'Cause I have been in
the office all day long.

404
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,470
It's been great.

405
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,640
Oh no, is it good or bad?

406
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,000
- Um it's healing.

407
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,860
I think, I've been like
why does it hurt so bad?

408
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,680
All you can see, like, you can
see where they cut it all out

409
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,810
but it's bruised, it's
like really bruised.

410
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,670
So that's why it's been hurting.

411
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,580
But, it's getting better.

412
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,413
- [Jared] Good.

413
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:52,300
- To you guys, Bollie has
finally finally been announced.

414
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,810
And I just wanna let you guys
know that a lot of these items

415
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,140

time, we are not going to be

00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,110

420
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,450

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,350
been a part of it to make this work.

422
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,650
Just very very excited.

423
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,970
Thank you guys for
watching our video today.

424
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,330
The kids had so much fun painting.

425
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,110
They zonked tonight.

426
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,870
Haircuts was fun, I hope I
was able to film that okay.

427
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:28,050
Jared was gonna make it
all, like, very nice in film

428
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,340
but then he ended up he
was in his office all day

429
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,390
working on the website, so

430
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,430
I appreciate his help.

431
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:35,110
Thank you guys and
we'll see you next time.

432
