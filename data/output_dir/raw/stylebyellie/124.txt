1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,715
- Calvin may have just got in trouble.

2
00:00:01,715 --> 00:00:03,761
Parenting, crazy.
(twangy gentle music)

3
00:00:03,761 --> 00:00:04,594
- I'm glad we have each other.

4
00:00:04,594 --> 00:00:05,427
- Yes.

5
00:00:05,427 --> 00:00:06,661
Let's go out and play.

6
00:00:06,661 --> 00:00:07,657
- Yay!

7
00:00:07,657 --> 00:00:08,490
- Oh!

8
00:00:13,332 --> 00:00:15,236
- [Ellie] Why did you
think to clean it up?

9
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:16,427
- Because.

10
00:00:16,427 --> 00:00:18,879
- [Ellie] Because you knew Mama
would come and clean it up?

11
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:21,146
- No, but I'm a good cleaner.

12
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,018
- [Ellie] (laughs) He's a good cleaner.

13
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,099
Where did Calvin go?

14
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,073
- He made a mess.

15
00:00:25,073 --> 00:00:26,843
- [Ellie] So he ran downstairs?

16
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,170
Calvin?

17
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,731
I know you're hiding behind the couch.

18
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,564
Come here.

19
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,397
I know I'm in my towel,

20
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:33,149
I know this is not a ushe,

21
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:35,519
but I just got the kids out of the tub,

22
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,990
just got them dressed for church,

23
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:40,296
and the moment I got in, I hear clink.

24
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:42,004
Again, my fault for leaving something out.

25
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:43,312
Thank you, I'll take it Jacks,

26
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,960
thanks, I appreciate it.

27
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,657
And Calvin totally dropped juice,

28
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:49,033
and I came out and
Jackson was cleaning it,

29
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:51,083
it was something I had to film so.

30
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:51,916
So cute.

31
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:55,110
- [Jackson] So cute.

32
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,894
- So that's as much of
a bath as I'm gonna get,

33
00:00:56,894 --> 00:00:58,159
a two minute bath.

34
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,909
(whimsical percussion music)

35
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,421
Why don't you film what
you and Calvin are doing?

36
00:01:11,421 --> 00:01:12,524
- [Jackson] Okay.

37
00:01:12,524 --> 00:01:14,246
Calvin and I are

38
00:01:14,246 --> 00:01:15,618
- [Ellie] Hi.

39
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:16,451
- [Jackson] Hi.

40
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,547
- Are you recording?

41
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:19,100
- [Jackson] Yes.

42
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,074
(whimsical percussion music)

43
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,066
- I've been trying to pick up a little bit

44
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:26,641
before I get ready.

45
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:28,048
And we broke out these toys.

46
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,215
I can't find half of them.

47
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:33,491
They're the little
people, the nativity set.

48
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:34,324
The kids love these,

49
00:01:34,324 --> 00:01:36,099
we break it out every year.

50
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,476
They've been playing with them lots,

51
00:01:37,476 --> 00:01:41,361
but you know, I find a bajillion cars,

52
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:43,948
and I think Jackson did
something with our settings,

53
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:47,176
'cause it looks kinda, it
looks kinda funny to me.

54
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:50,040
Anyway, just picking up before church.

55
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,873
Hey Jared?

56
00:01:50,873 --> 00:01:51,706
- [Jared] Yeah.

57
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:53,426
- [Ellie] You know how you
put Calvin in his room?

58
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,330
- [Jared] Yeah.

59
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,311
- Well Jackson's in there with him.

60
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,602
- [Jared] Jackson's in there with him?

61
00:01:57,602 --> 00:01:58,978
- Yeah.

62
00:01:58,978 --> 00:02:00,099
- [Jared] Well as long
as they stay in the room.

63
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:01,999
- Yeah (laughs).

64
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,793
First, I have changed like three times

65
00:02:03,793 --> 00:02:06,067
and Calvin may have just got in trouble,

66
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,914
so he's in his room,

67
00:02:07,914 --> 00:02:10,020
and Jackson went in there

68
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,301
and is playing with him, while
he's in trouble in his room,

69
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:16,298
which I think is cute, but

70
00:02:16,298 --> 00:02:17,648
- Calvin wants to be out.

71
00:02:17,648 --> 00:02:19,967
- [Ellie] Calvin wants to be out?

72
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,418
I'm sure he does.

73
00:02:21,418 --> 00:02:23,648
Did you come in to play with him?

74
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:24,481
- Uh-huh.

75
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,188
- [Ellie] You came in to play with Calvin?

76
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,313
'Cause you thought it was
sad that he was in here?

77
00:02:29,313 --> 00:02:30,146
- Yeah.

78
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:31,695
- He really did not want
him being in trouble,

79
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,343
he's like noooo!

80
00:02:33,343 --> 00:02:36,144
Okay, Calvin are you gonna be good?

81
00:02:36,144 --> 00:02:39,091
Okay, come on, let's go out and play.

82
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:39,924
- Yay!

83
00:02:40,763 --> 00:02:42,405
Pssh pssh.

84
00:02:42,405 --> 00:02:43,846
Spiderman!

85
00:02:43,846 --> 00:02:44,679
(laughs)

86
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,486
- Now finally, get ready for church.

87
00:02:46,486 --> 00:02:49,702
So what are you gonna make for lunch?

88
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,656
- [Jared] I don't even
know what recipes we have.

89
00:02:51,656 --> 00:02:53,135
Is there something that sounds good?

90
00:02:53,135 --> 00:02:54,036
- Anything.

91
00:02:54,036 --> 00:02:55,900
Anything'll do.

92
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,765
- [Jared] Well let's make sure
it something that sounds good

93
00:02:57,765 --> 00:02:58,661
to you when I'm done.

94
00:02:58,661 --> 00:02:59,805
- Okay.

95
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:02,205
I've been going really slow this morning.

96
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:03,038
- [Jared] Huh?

97
00:03:03,038 --> 00:03:04,621
- I'm just filming.

98
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,492
- I've been going really slow this morning

99
00:03:07,492 --> 00:03:08,991
and Jared said he had--

100
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,567
- [Jared] Sweetie I'm
sorry, I can't hear you.

101
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:13,571
- I'm just filming.

102
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:14,404
- [Jared] Okay.
(laughs)

103
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:16,150
- I've been going slow this morning

104
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,109
and Jared's like I'll make lunch,

105
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,352
because I was like, I don't even know,

106
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:21,899
I don't feel like making
anything right now.

107
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:24,982
So he's gonna make some lunch for us.

108
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:27,025
(boys laughing)

109
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:30,473
You hooligans, what are you doing?

110
00:03:30,473 --> 00:03:31,306
- [Jackson] Nothing.

111
00:03:31,306 --> 00:03:33,270
Dad, are you in the shower?

112
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,782
- [Jared] I don't have any clothes on,

113
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:35,902
don't come in the shower.

114
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:37,556
- Yeah, don't get in the shower.

115
00:03:37,556 --> 00:03:41,549
- [Jackson] Calvin did
coming out of in his room.

116
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:43,015
- [Jared] That's okay.

117
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:43,848
- [Jackson] He can.

118
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:44,829
- [Jared] He can.

119
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,051
- [Jackson] Yeah, he's okay.

120
00:03:46,051 --> 00:03:47,843
- I've been loving seeing the boys play.

121
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:50,908
I mean I feel like they've
gotten along really well,

122
00:03:50,908 --> 00:03:52,416
like they've been so close in age,

123
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,897
that they've just gotten along.

124
00:03:53,897 --> 00:03:56,022
But there's been so many times

125
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:58,221
where I especially look at them

126
00:03:58,221 --> 00:03:59,549
and I'm just like, I'm so grateful

127
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:00,555
that they're playing right now.

128
00:04:00,555 --> 00:04:03,053
Like some mornings are not smooth

129
00:04:03,053 --> 00:04:05,096
and some are, and this
morning has not really

130
00:04:05,096 --> 00:04:07,279
been the smoothest,
and I'm really grateful

131
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:09,036
that they're just following each other

132
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:10,643
around and just playing.

133
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,611
It's really helped me out a lot.

134
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,060
So I'm really grateful for that.

135
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,560
(bright electronic music)

136
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:23,815
- I'm about to Mr. Miyagi this,

137
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:24,648
just you wait and see.

138
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:26,381
So the goal here, I gotta flip this up,

139
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:27,589
oh front row seat,

140
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:29,541
I've gotta flip this up,

141
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,565
while it's in the air,

142
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:33,501
put this one on and then catch this one

143
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:35,450
out of the air, before it hits the ground.

144
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,402
- [Ellie] Let's see it.

145
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,235
Ready?

146
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,068
Ready girl?

147
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,285
Ready (panting), ready?

148
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,965
(Ellie howling)

149
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:43,184
(Ellie laughs)

150
00:04:43,184 --> 00:04:44,017
- Oh!

151
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:46,082
Did you see that?

152
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,262
- [Ellie] That was amazing.

153
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:48,701
Let's get a slo mo replay of that.

154
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:52,201
(bright electronic music)

155
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:54,627
Oh!

156
00:04:55,703 --> 00:04:58,000
- [Ellie] Alright mister, you've
been a troublemaker today,

157
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,485
but I am very grateful that
you're eating broccoli,

158
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:01,733
so thank you.

159
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:03,143
(Ellie laughs)

160
00:05:03,143 --> 00:05:04,810
You ate that all up.

161
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:06,847
Holy moly.

162
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,892
Is that yummy?

163
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,676
Wow, do you need a drink?

164
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:14,259
Wow, it's all gone.

165
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:18,028
Want another one?

166
00:05:18,028 --> 00:05:19,532
Okay, there you go.

167
00:05:19,532 --> 00:05:20,684
There's another one.

168
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,624
I think Penny wants one too.

169
00:05:22,624 --> 00:05:25,291
Hi hi, do you want to wear this?

170
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,975
- [Calvin] Yeah.

171
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:30,556
- You want to wear it now?

172
00:05:30,556 --> 00:05:31,815
Hey.

173
00:05:31,815 --> 00:05:33,815
Come up here to my face.

174
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:37,309
Calvin, come up here to my face.

175
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:38,685
(Calvin laughs)

176
00:05:38,685 --> 00:05:41,926
(Calvin breathing)

177
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:42,991
- [Jared] Jackson?

178
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:44,222
- [Jackson] Huh?

179
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:46,159
- [Jared] Are you in here?

180
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,992
- Yeah.

181
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,369
- [Jared] What are you doing?

182
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:52,417
What's on your mouth?

183
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,285
- Oreo.

184
00:05:53,285 --> 00:05:55,141
- [Jared] Oreo, did you sneak in here

185
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:56,663
to have an Oreo?

186
00:05:56,663 --> 00:05:57,496
- Yeah.

187
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:59,509
- Without us knowing?

188
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,172
Here's the deal bud.

189
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:03,179
I'm not mad that you had an Oreo.

190
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:04,469
I just with you had an Oreo

191
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:06,900
after we had dinner, okay?

192
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,236
You don't have to sneak around.

193
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:09,391
I'm gonna let you have an Oreo,

194
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:10,779
but it'll just have to be after dinner.

195
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,701
Penny lick his face, get that Oreo off.

196
00:06:12,701 --> 00:06:15,291
Actually don't do that,
because it's chocolate.

197
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,124
Okay?

198
00:06:16,124 --> 00:06:17,482
I'm not mad that you had an Oreo,

199
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,005
I'm mad that you snuck it.

200
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:21,621
Just ask, and we'll have
one after dinner okay?

201
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:23,543
Now that I've had some time
to talk with Jackson alone,

202
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,405
on a serious note, I don't like that.

203
00:06:25,405 --> 00:06:26,509
I don't like that that he came in here

204
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:27,405
and snuck in here,

205
00:06:27,405 --> 00:06:30,036
and it's not something
that I want him to do.

206
00:06:30,036 --> 00:06:31,623
I am fine with him having an Oreo,

207
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:32,927
but I don't want him to sneak around

208
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:36,219
to get it, so I think it's
important that I caught him

209
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,897
and that I told him that.

210
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,224
I think he gets it from you.

211
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:40,986
- I'm not gonna deny it.

212
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:43,310
- So we got home from
church not too long ago

213
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,028
and look out outside.

214
00:06:45,028 --> 00:06:47,061
It is so dark outside.

215
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:49,446
Daylight saving changed
while we were in China

216
00:06:49,446 --> 00:06:51,248
and I'm still not used to it,

217
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,731
just how dark it get so fast.

218
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,884
It's 5:40 and it is dark.

219
00:06:53,884 --> 00:06:55,719
- [Ellie] Why do they even
have daylight savings?

220
00:06:55,719 --> 00:06:57,803
- Well I think they're trying
to get rid of it actually.

221
00:06:57,803 --> 00:07:00,019
- I think there's a lot
of parts that don't do it,

222
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,666
and a lot of people are
like, let's just stick with

223
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,394
I like the time it was before.
- Yeah.

224
00:07:04,394 --> 00:07:05,394
- Right.

225
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:08,073
I think Arizona doesn't do it,

226
00:07:08,073 --> 00:07:10,231
I think part of it, I'm not sure,

227
00:07:10,231 --> 00:07:12,398
but I'm all for not doing
daylight savings time,

228
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,425
just 'cause half of our
clocks automatically switch

229
00:07:14,425 --> 00:07:16,208
and half of our clocks don't,

230
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,506
so then I'm even more confused.

231
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,830
- It's like every six months,
you have to reteach the kids.

232
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,663
- Yeah exactly.

233
00:07:20,663 --> 00:07:22,038
- Go to bed, but.

234
00:07:22,038 --> 00:07:24,583
- It's nice when you get
an extra hour to sleep in,

235
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:25,759
but it's terrible for the kids,

236
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,255
because they don't care.

237
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:28,463
They're like I'm not gonna sleep in.

238
00:07:28,463 --> 00:07:30,138
I'm gonna do what my body says.

239
00:07:30,138 --> 00:07:31,223
And if that's Calvin,

240
00:07:31,223 --> 00:07:32,238
that's wake up at midnight

241
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,234
and wake up at four inn the morning.

242
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,084
(laughs)

243
00:07:35,084 --> 00:07:36,175
(mock cries)

244
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:37,008
Hey.

245
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:37,841
- What?

246
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,554
- [Jared] Do you like to sleep?

247
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:42,252
- Mommy's bed.
- Yeah?

248
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:43,274
- [Jared] In Mommy's bed?

249
00:07:43,274 --> 00:07:44,107
- Yeah.

250
00:07:44,107 --> 00:07:44,940
- [Jared] Oh and of course.

251
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,613
- I like to sleep in your bed.

252
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:47,859
- [Jared] You like to sleep in our bed?

253
00:07:47,859 --> 00:07:48,692
- Yeah.

254
00:07:48,692 --> 00:07:49,558
- [Jared] You actually slept in your bed

255
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:50,566
the whole night last night.

256
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:51,733
High five bud.

257
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,611
Yeah!
- Ya!

258
00:07:53,611 --> 00:07:55,460
- So Ellie had me go to the store today

259
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,499
to pick up something,

260
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,380
and while I was at the store,

261
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,251
I had something that drove
me crazy happen today.

262
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:05,756
I had the cashier register person

263
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:10,547
comment to me about what
I had in my shopping cart,

264
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:12,435
and I was just like,

265
00:08:12,435 --> 00:08:14,912
I don't like that, I don't
know is that bad, is that bad?

266
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:15,745
I don't think it's bad.

267
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,947
- It's not bad at all.

268
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:18,755
I think it's really unprofessional.

269
00:08:18,755 --> 00:08:21,960
- Yeah, so she was like, oh,
looks like you're buying this,

270
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,177
what are you doing that for?

271
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,012
I'm like uh I don't know,

272
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,244
I don't want to explain
my situation to you.

273
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:30,188
What if I was buying like

274
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:31,415
- Lube for the car?

275
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:32,402
- Lube for the car.

276
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:33,235
(laughs)

277
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:35,231
That's right, that's what
I told Ellie earlier.

278
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:37,331
Or like tampons, or like
something, I don't know,

279
00:08:37,331 --> 00:08:39,020
just like anything crazy like that.

280
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,434
I don't want to have to explain it to you.

281
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:42,304
- Well not even anything crazy,

282
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,649
diapers, rash cream.

283
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,176
- Yeah, why are you buying this?

284
00:08:47,176 --> 00:08:49,444
I just, I need it, that's
why I need to buy it.

285
00:08:49,444 --> 00:08:50,837
So I thought about it,

286
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:52,580
that's a huge pet peeve of mine,

287
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,182
is like for someone to
comment about the things

288
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,364
that I'm buying, it's just
like (stammers) anyway.

289
00:08:57,364 --> 00:08:58,849
So I thought it would be fun

290
00:08:58,849 --> 00:09:02,175
to make a video of our worst pet peeves.

291
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,159
- [Ellie] Totally.

292
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,509
- So I'm compiling a list
of my worst pet peeves.

293
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,892
I have two so far.

294
00:09:06,892 --> 00:09:09,595
And honestly, I'm a really
really easy going person.

295
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,282
Ellie, would you stand by that sentiment,

296
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:12,810
that I'm an easy going guy?

297
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,086
- Totally, but I do agree,
- Not a lot bothers me.

298
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,964
- I think that kind of
bugs me too, when people

299
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:18,755
I love talking to the cashiers,

300
00:09:18,755 --> 00:09:19,588
- [Jared] Yeah.

301
00:09:19,588 --> 00:09:20,421
- Like when we talk that's fun,

302
00:09:20,421 --> 00:09:21,562
but when they comment
about what I'm buying,

303
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,274
sometimes I'm like uhhh.

304
00:09:24,274 --> 00:09:26,613
- So I have a couple in mind already,

305
00:09:26,613 --> 00:09:28,597
but what I would like you to do

306
00:09:28,597 --> 00:09:30,989
is comment your worst pet peeve

307
00:09:30,989 --> 00:09:32,877
in the comment section down below

308
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:33,710
- [Ellie] Yes.

309
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,767
- and I would love to read through 'em.

310
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:36,933
Because I know we all have some.

311
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:38,828
I had some when I was a
kid that just bothered me,

312
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,595
but even in today's day and age,

313
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:43,214
it's like with all the
electronics and all that,

314
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:44,047
- When people tail you,

315
00:09:44,047 --> 00:09:44,880
that's totally another one of Jared's.

316
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,463
- That is another one, oh.

317
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,081
I think it's because we're in Utah.

318
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:50,890
The Utah drivers are just not
the greatest in the world.

319
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,723
- We're bad.

320
00:09:51,723 --> 00:09:52,556
(laughs)

321
00:09:52,556 --> 00:09:53,389
I did want to say something,

322
00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:54,819
before we end the vlog.

323
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:55,897
I hope Jared's okay with this.

324
00:09:55,897 --> 00:09:58,623
We kind of talked about it earlier.

325
00:09:58,623 --> 00:10:00,830
So, we were in China for a week.

326
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,249
We were ahead of videos for a week,

327
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,991
and right now we're two days ahead.

328
00:10:04,991 --> 00:10:06,863
And we've had some questions,

329
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:08,981
saying are you guys gonna
continue to be ahead,

330
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:12,457
are you gonna go back
to being the next day?

331
00:10:12,457 --> 00:10:13,532
That's something that Jared

332
00:10:13,532 --> 00:10:14,899
and I have thought a lot about.

333
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:16,236
We've come to the conclusion

334
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:19,996
that we are gonna be two days ahead.

335
00:10:19,996 --> 00:10:21,972
We are not not doing videos,

336
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:23,940
we're gonna keep doing daily videos,

337
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,628
it's just gonna be two day behind,

338
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,047
is that what I said, or ahead?

339
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,469
- I think they understand what you mean.

340
00:10:29,469 --> 00:10:30,417
- Two days behind.

341
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:33,569
And the reason why we've
decided that is because,

342
00:10:33,569 --> 00:10:35,480
we've been doing this for four years,

343
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,787
I've told Jared that one of the things

344
00:10:36,787 --> 00:10:39,211
that I need to be doing
personally for myself

345
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:42,044
is just slowing down a little bit.

346
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:45,277
And that's a lot in my personal life,

347
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,798
that's a little bit with vlogging.

348
00:10:47,798 --> 00:10:50,550
I just want to just be a little bit more.

349
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,624
I notice that with us
being two days behind,

350
00:10:53,624 --> 00:10:57,192
it's helped Jared and I tremendously.

351
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:59,608
It's put a weight of stress off of Jared.

352
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,168
- I think when it comes down to it,

353
00:11:02,168 --> 00:11:04,624
our marriage needs it.

354
00:11:04,624 --> 00:11:05,457
- It does.

355
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:09,200
- And that's the most important
thing for all of this.

356
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,531
And I suggest, I mean I feel
like a lot of other people

357
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:14,780
should do it and because it does help.

358
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,447
I don't think it's
completely understandable

359
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:22,981
unless you are in this situation yourself.

360
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:23,814
- Yeah.

361
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:25,569
- Because it's like well you only film

362
00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:27,457
for 15, 20 minutes a day,

363
00:11:27,457 --> 00:11:29,257
but it is more than that,

364
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:32,026
but I think for the sake
of our relationship,

365
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,297
for the sake of our kids

366
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:35,586
and everything that goes along with it,

367
00:11:35,586 --> 00:11:37,818
this puts us in a better situation,

368
00:11:37,818 --> 00:11:41,260
so we're happier, the
content is more enjoyable

369
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,651
and all of that, so it works
out for everyone I think.

370
00:11:43,651 --> 00:11:45,480
- It does, and part of that is,

371
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,340
instead of tonight, us watching,

372
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,212
you know, unwinding together

373
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:52,553
and then it's like 10 o'clock bedtime,

374
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:53,386
then Jared stays up really late

375
00:11:53,386 --> 00:11:55,160
to edit for the next day.

376
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,968
But instead, he could've
already had yesterday's video

377
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,695
edited and then he could have that time

378
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:01,896
to go to bed with me.

379
00:12:01,896 --> 00:12:03,746
- There's not a lot of
times where Ellie and I

380
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:04,706
go to be together,

381
00:12:04,706 --> 00:12:06,360
and I don't think that's
the healthiest thing.

382
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,193
- Yeah.

383
00:12:07,193 --> 00:12:09,204
So that's what we've decided.

384
00:12:09,204 --> 00:12:11,761
And we know that some
people may not like this,

385
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:13,437
that's okay if that's how you feel.

386
00:12:13,437 --> 00:12:14,758
This is what we've decided to do.

387
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:16,432
We're still doing daily videos.

388
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:17,790
But thank you for those of you

389
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,299
that do support us and
understand our situation.

390
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:22,957
And on a side note, this is where,

391
00:12:22,957 --> 00:12:24,341
where Jared and I have
understood about this,

392
00:12:24,341 --> 00:12:28,158
but the one thing we've kind
of had a disagreement with,

393
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:30,283
is like holidays
- Holidays.

394
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:31,124
- and birthdays.

395
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:31,957
- Yeah.

396
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:32,790
- And he's like well the holiday,

397
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:35,220
that'll still go out the next day.

398
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,610
And we don't know,

399
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,634
we'll still have to talk this out.

400
00:12:37,634 --> 00:12:38,596
- Yeah.

401
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:39,429
- You correct me if I'm wrong.

402
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,438
- No I think we should
definitely talk about it more.

403
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:43,794
Because, just to show you where we are,

404
00:12:43,794 --> 00:12:46,454
my thought was like let's
do it on the holiday,

405
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,489
have 'em go up, so it
just feels more in sync,

406
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,480
because those are identifying days.

407
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,313
- Yeah.

408
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,146
- But then Ellie's position,

409
00:12:53,146 --> 00:12:54,200
which I totally understand,

410
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,335
is like, but then we're not
together on the holidays.

411
00:12:56,335 --> 00:12:58,631
You're working hours and hours and hours.

412
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:01,325
- You know, Christmas night,
Jared will still be up

413
00:13:01,325 --> 00:13:03,187
all hours of the night
and then be really tired

414
00:13:03,187 --> 00:13:05,394
in the morning, because he's been editing

415
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:07,209
a crazy, fun day for us,

416
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,169
because that's the footage
that I want personally.

417
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,833
But then a fun extra
vlog is able to go up.

418
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:16,719
So I think we should still
stick with the two days behind,

419
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,275
even with holidays and
birthdays especially,

420
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,767
because those are our
days to really party.

421
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,711
- Yeah.

422
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:22,804
- Especially birth vlogs.

423
00:13:22,804 --> 00:13:25,459
I told Jared, the next
time we have a baby,

424
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:26,981
it cannot go up the next day,

425
00:13:26,981 --> 00:13:31,264
because I need, I just I
want you in the bed with me,

426
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:33,822
holding the baby with
me for hours and hours,

427
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,967
and of course we get that
awesome time together.

428
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:36,800
- Yeah.

429
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,565
- But there's just a few moments,

430
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,056
where I want to be selfish
and have you one more time.

431
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:44,153
- I spent eight hours
in the hospital editing.

432
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:45,224
- Yeah, for us.

433
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,834
And I'm not saying like that's

434
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,435
Jared and I having a conversation,

435
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:49,580
and we're allowing you to be a part of it.

436
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,040
- Yeah, this is a real conversation

437
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,873
we're having right now.

438
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,162
- And that footage is for us,

439
00:13:54,162 --> 00:13:55,725
but it just doesn't have to,

440
00:13:55,725 --> 00:13:57,897
but the going up the next
day is for other people,

441
00:13:57,897 --> 00:14:01,134
and we've decided to let
it go for a few days later.

442
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,285
And take it back to, about us still.

443
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,541
- Yeah absolutely.

444
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:07,597
The cool thing, the most amazing thing

445
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,149
about what we do, which
we are so grateful,

446
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,742
is the ability to change and adapt

447
00:14:13,742 --> 00:14:15,256
the things that we do.

448
00:14:15,256 --> 00:14:18,520
Nothing is set in stone with YouTube.

449
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,728
And so we can change things,
we can adapt to things,

450
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,296
we can go back to things.

451
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,137
We've had the privilege and opportunity

452
00:14:25,137 --> 00:14:27,474
to do this for such a long time.

453
00:14:27,474 --> 00:14:28,307
- Agreed.

454
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,774
- And I love what we do and so, you know.

455
00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:32,808
- But like we said,
thank you for listening

456
00:14:32,808 --> 00:14:33,942
and thank you for supporting us

457
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,937
in the decision that we are making.

458
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,967
Today again, I've been
saying this every day,

459
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,080
this has been an interesting weekend.

460
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,568
(laughs)

461
00:14:42,568 --> 00:14:44,081
I don't even know what we captured today.

462
00:14:44,081 --> 00:14:45,771
I don't even know if it's good.

463
00:14:45,771 --> 00:14:47,034
- Our brains are still kind of melted

464
00:14:47,034 --> 00:14:47,958
from the whole weekend.

465
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,937
- But today was a day, where we have said

466
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,785
Calvin's middle name a thousand times.

467
00:14:53,785 --> 00:14:54,989
They've been so good to play,

468
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:56,062
but they've also been

469
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,097
so naughty.
- So mischievous.

470
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,400
- So we are going to rest our eyes.

471
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,614
- But real quick, real quick,

472
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,373
I have to say this,

473
00:15:03,373 --> 00:15:05,944
Ellie and I like, the kids do something,

474
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,108
and it's like you should not do something,

475
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,013
so we discipline them, and
then we look at each other

476
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:12,530
and we just start laughing, because--

477
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,802
- With them not in sight.

478
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:15,596
- They don't see us do that.

479
00:15:15,596 --> 00:15:16,629
- We try not to.

480
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:17,865
- It's just like

481
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:18,915
- What were they thinking?

482
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:19,823
- What were they thinking?

483
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:20,918
This is kinda cute,

484
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:21,887
but I don't want them to do it again.

485
00:15:21,887 --> 00:15:24,419
- Calvin's just made a lot of--

486
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:25,252
- Messes?

487
00:15:25,252 --> 00:15:27,086
- He likes the soap dispenser and--

488
00:15:27,086 --> 00:15:28,661
- Just put two and two together.

489
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,237
- And we've gotten upset
with him a few times,

490
00:15:31,237 --> 00:15:33,956
but today we really
had to lay the law down

491
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,220
and he didn't like that.

492
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,053
Nor did we.

493
00:15:36,053 --> 00:15:36,886
(laughing)

494
00:15:36,886 --> 00:15:38,067
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

495
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:38,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

496
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,083
- Parenting.

497
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:40,916
It's crazy.

498
00:15:40,916 --> 00:00:00,000
- I'm glad we have each other.
- Yes.
