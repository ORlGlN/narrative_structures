1
00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,594
- Come on boys, let's get our shoes on.

2
00:00:01,594 --> 00:00:03,907
There's so little to do
and so much time to do it.

3
00:00:03,907 --> 00:00:05,734
- [Jackson] I have
something little to bring.

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:08,048
Or actually reverse that.
- A jack-in-the-box.

5
00:00:08,048 --> 00:00:09,038
- What's that?

6
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:09,871
- It's the jack-in-the-box.

7
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:11,781
- Perfect, that's a
perfect show and tell item.

8
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:13,964
Today is Jackson's
first day back to school

9
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,810
in the brand new year

10
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,021
and we are getting ready to go.

11
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:18,328
We've got two minutes actually.

12
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,161
So let's go.

13
00:00:19,161 --> 00:00:19,994
- Put it in here.

14
00:00:19,994 --> 00:00:22,309
- I want you to wind this up.

15
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:24,197
- [Jared] Here, Mom
will lock it up for ya.

16
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:25,030
(winding music)

17
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,317
- Perfect.
- Great.

18
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:29,310
- Now I think it's show and tell,

19
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,407
but we're gonna leave it in here,

20
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,090
and you'll only get it out
when your teacher says, okay?

21
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,043
- Okay.

22
00:00:34,043 --> 00:00:35,063
- [Jared] You got your shoes on?

23
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:35,896
- [Jackson] Yep.

24
00:00:35,896 --> 00:00:36,729
- [Jared] Good.

25
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:38,268
Come on Cal, let's get
your shoes on buddy.

26
00:00:38,268 --> 00:00:40,426
Oh good, you got your show and tell item?

- [Jared] Oh no song?

37
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:03,633
Is Daddy a bad singer?

38
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,275
Let's not answer that question.

39
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:06,140
- Sing me that song.

40
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,973

46
00:01:15,388 --> 00:01:17,103
Calvin, go grab your coat.

47
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,868
- [Ellie] Found your coat right here.

48
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:19,983
- Aww, so handsome.

49
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,636
Oh he's like no way Mama.

50
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:24,112
Trust me, he'll want it
on, once he gets outside.

51
00:01:24,112 --> 00:01:24,945
It's cold.

52
00:01:24,945 --> 00:01:26,240
- [Ellie] Hey my shopping buddy.

53
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,497
How are you?

54
00:01:27,497 --> 00:01:28,336
- Good.

55
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:29,659
- Are you my shopping buddy?

56
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,894
So I was watching, I think her name is

57
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:33,062
At Home with Nikki

58
00:01:33,062 --> 00:01:34,337
or Cleaning with Nikki.

59
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:35,240
She's on YouTube.

60
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,579
She has this awesome organization channel

61
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,235
and I have been just throwing
all of my Christmas bulbs,

62
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:42,905
just throwing them in a box,

63
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:45,292
and a few of them have
broken because of that,

64
00:01:45,292 --> 00:01:46,468
and I want to do a little bit better

65
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:49,465
with me putting my tree
down and organizing.

66
00:01:49,465 --> 00:01:51,425
So I'm at Big Lots and they have these

67
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:54,842
awesome storage things for the ornaments.

68
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,930
I'm just gonna get a
few things to organize

69
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,137
as I put the tree away today.

70
00:02:00,137 --> 00:02:03,347
I'm a little late on
doing that, but oh don't--

71
00:02:03,347 --> 00:02:05,500
Oh naughty naughty.

72
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,864
Well that was a little naughty,

73
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:08,983
throwing all of my cards out.

74
00:02:08,983 --> 00:02:11,118
Okay, I got everything put back together.

75
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,191
Sit on your bottom.

76
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:13,303
Thank you.

77
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:15,420
And guess what, if you're really good,

78
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,388
maybe we'll get a snack,

79
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:18,884
maybe some crackers or something.

80
00:02:18,884 --> 00:02:19,828
Did you have fun at school?

81
00:02:19,828 --> 00:02:20,661
- Yeah.

82
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:23,173
- [Ellie] Did you show
'em your show and tell?

83
00:02:23,173 --> 00:02:24,033
- Yeah.

84
00:02:24,033 --> 00:02:25,273
- [Ellie] Did they love it?

85
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:26,542
- They laughed at it.

86
00:02:26,542 --> 00:02:27,375
- [Ellie] They did?

87
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:28,208
- Mmm-hmm.

88
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:29,339
- [Ellie] Did they think it was cool?

89
00:02:29,339 --> 00:02:31,506
- And I did this, woo woo!

90
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,530
- [Ellie] When you opened it up?

91
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,448
- Uh-huh.

92
00:02:34,448 --> 00:02:35,484
- [Ellie] And what was your favorite thing

93
00:02:35,484 --> 00:02:36,828
that someone else brought?

94
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:37,892
- A tooting monkey.

95
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,662
- [Ellie] A tooting monkey?

96
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:40,702

Well actually, Ellie is gonna
be taking the tree down,

103
00:03:04,075 --> 00:03:05,883
because I have an errand to run.

104
00:03:05,883 --> 00:03:07,539
Are you gonna help Calvin?

105
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:09,939
Did you like the Christmas tree Calvin?

106
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,778
Yeah, was it pretty fun?

107
00:03:11,778 --> 00:03:13,850
You like playing with the ornaments, huh?

108
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,175
Yeah.
- Did you break 'em?

109
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:17,232
(laughing)

110
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:18,411
- Oh oh oh!

111
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:21,931
I have proof downstairs
that says otherwise.

112
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:22,764
You know what?

113
00:03:22,764 --> 00:03:24,884
This picture that I'm gonna
insert says otherwise.

114
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:25,881
(dramatic music)

115
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:26,979
- What picture?

116
00:03:26,979 --> 00:03:28,233
(dramatic music)

117
00:03:28,233 --> 00:03:29,678
- [Jared] It's a picture
that says otherwise.

118
00:03:29,678 --> 00:03:30,889
(dramatic music)

119
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,896
(laughing)

120
00:03:33,896 --> 00:03:36,168
Okay, I've got to run a quick errand.

121
00:03:36,168 --> 00:03:38,755
- Hey, are these gonna hold my big bulbs?

122
00:03:38,755 --> 00:03:40,404
- [Jared] Let's see if
these balls will fit.

123
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:41,566
- [Ellie] No, just this one.

124
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:43,248
- [Jared] The big one?

125
00:03:43,248 --> 00:03:44,081
Ooh Ellie.

126
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,914
- Will it?

127
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,414
What the?
- Oh no!

128
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,609
- [Jared] Sorry.

129
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,346
Your balls are too big.

130
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:51,737
- Well that sucks.

131
00:03:51,737 --> 00:03:52,698
- [Jared] Welcome to my world.

132
00:03:52,698 --> 00:03:53,531
(Jared laughs)

133
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,741
- Throw it away, there you go.

134
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:55,574
- [Jared] Throw it away?

135
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:58,663
- No put it down, I'll put it in the box.

136
00:03:58,663 --> 00:04:01,184
Not there, you're breaking it.

137
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,017
- [Jared] Alrighty.

138
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,752
Have fun taking the tree down, sister Sue.

139
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:05,127
- That's kind of annoying.

140
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,996
- I'm sorry.
- Will this fit?

141
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,409
- [Jared] Will your little balls fit?

142
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:09,242
Yep, Oh!

143
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,197
Barely.

144
00:04:12,197 --> 00:04:13,812
- What the heck?

145
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:17,423
Not everyone has teeny little ornaments.

146
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,765
- [Jared] Yeah, 'cause
you can only fit like 12--

147
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,223
- Okay, this'll work, this'll work.

148
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:21,401
- [Jared] Yeah, that's better.

149
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,563
You just gotta put it the right way.

150
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,417
Good luck, good luck, bye.

151
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,250
- Ah!

152
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,546
- [Jared] Oh!

153
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,849
Looks like Calvin's not the only one

154
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,791
breaking ornaments, Ellie.

155
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,863
- I'm self-conscious when I say ornaments.

156
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:37,984
- Because you used to say ordaments?

157
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:39,008
- Leave me alone.

158
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:39,901
- [Jared] Okay bye.

159
00:04:39,901 --> 00:04:40,927
- Every time Penny gets groomed,

160
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:44,177
she hates having the little paper towel

161
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:47,151
or, not paper towel,
the handkerchief on her.

162
00:04:47,151 --> 00:04:48,662
She hates it.

163
00:04:48,662 --> 00:04:49,966
But this time, she's left it on,

164
00:04:49,966 --> 00:04:52,143
she's done so well.

165
00:04:52,143 --> 00:04:54,182
I'm so proud of her.

166
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:56,599
Oh, Jared's working with her.

167
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:01,949
- Okay, good girl.

168
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:06,630
- I don't know if it's because I just

169
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,240
am having the full day to myself,

170
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,158
just unwinding, taking the Christmas down

171
00:05:11,158 --> 00:05:13,958
or if it's because I'm 15
weeks pregnant and I'm tired.

172
00:05:13,958 --> 00:05:15,998
It's taken me hours.

173
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:16,870
But I'm going slow,

174
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,158
because I don't want to
just throw everything

175
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:20,409
in that room downstairs.

176
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:22,627
I kinda want to organize stuff as I go.

177
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,513
Because before the baby comes--

178
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:25,496
What?

179
00:05:25,496 --> 00:05:27,971
- I want to play with
one of those puzzles.

180
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:30,631
- Okay let me go get one.

181
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,282
In the bag, I need to figure that out.

182
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:34,882
- I want the lightning.

183
00:05:34,882 --> 00:05:35,997
- The lightning?

184
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,429
- Yeah the car one.

185
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:38,262
- When you're done with that one,

186
00:05:38,262 --> 00:05:39,642
I'll give you another one.

187
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:42,117
- I want you, but I want help.

188
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:42,950
- Okay I can help you.

189
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,098
Let's go in the living room.

190
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,131
Yeah, before the baby comes,

191
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:47,714
I want to organize,

192
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:51,003
I want to make sure all of the rooms

193
00:05:51,003 --> 00:05:52,363
are how I want them.

194
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:55,195
And even now, my house is organized,

195
00:05:55,195 --> 00:05:57,019
it's clean, we moved in a year ago,

196
00:05:57,019 --> 00:05:58,227
it's not too bad,

197
00:05:58,227 --> 00:06:00,220
but there's just a few
things I want to do.

198
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,644
Like we still have our temple picture,

199
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,516
where we got married, I
want to hang that up above

200
00:06:04,516 --> 00:06:05,946
the piano downstairs.

201
00:06:05,946 --> 00:06:09,619
I just have a few small
things that I want to do.

202
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,927
That main bedroom downstairs

203
00:06:11,927 --> 00:06:14,263
is like all decorated and stuff.

204
00:06:14,263 --> 00:06:16,518
I have a bunch of picture frames

205
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:17,927
that I want to put up

206
00:06:17,927 --> 00:06:20,983
and put like my grandma, Jared's grandma,

207
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:24,175
our moms and pictures
of them on that wall.

208
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,807
But the rest of the room looks really good

209
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:29,047
and it's decorated.

210
00:06:29,047 --> 00:06:30,088
So, just stuff like that.

211
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,631
I just want to do some things.

212
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:34,413
So the baby comes in six months

213
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:36,330
and that's a long time,

214
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:39,535
but in a way, it goes by so fast,

215
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:43,452
and so I just want to
slowly do things as I go.

216
00:06:45,234 --> 00:06:47,484
(clicking)

217
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:53,751
(Calvin vocalizing)

218
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:54,783
Taking a break and working on

219
00:06:54,783 --> 00:06:55,680
some bullet journaling.

220
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,838
I'm just starting my planner for the year.

221
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:01,657
I'm very excited.

222
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:02,921
These are my goals.

223
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:05,305
I just have one goal

224
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,009
and that's just to feel at peace

225
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,716
with whatever decisions I'm doing.

226
00:07:09,716 --> 00:07:11,468
I feel like a lot of my stresses

227
00:07:11,468 --> 00:07:13,801
are always like self caused,

228
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,995
and a lot of times, I just need

229
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,583
to make decisions or decide something

230
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:21,583
and feel good about what I decide.

231
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,655
So that's my one goal.

232
00:07:23,655 --> 00:07:25,565
And I'm sitting here trying to draw,

233
00:07:25,565 --> 00:07:27,705
and trying to make it look really good.

234
00:07:27,705 --> 00:07:28,600
And I find it ironic

235
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,712
that I was drawing the word peace,

236
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:33,629
as Calvin was screaming at my feet.

237
00:07:34,818 --> 00:07:36,218
So I got him taken care of.

238
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,402
The kids had a little drawing session,

239
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:40,803
but they were done after two minutes,

240
00:07:40,803 --> 00:07:43,553
so I'm gonna sit here and keep doing it.

241
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:44,752
I'm just like,

242
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:46,491
I'm just all over the place today,

243
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:48,555
that's what I'm doing and I love it.

244
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,254
- Ellie, I'm super impressed.

245
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:51,250
- Ah!

246
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,828
- [Jared] Uh-oh.

247
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,085
- Don't use the eraser
until it's officially dry.

248
00:07:55,085 --> 00:07:56,695
- [Jared] Ellie that looks so good

249
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:58,366
and look at that peace.

250
00:07:58,366 --> 00:08:00,066
That looks so great.

251
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,580
- [Ellie] Thanks Jare.

252
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,003
- [Jared] The one thing
is your E and your C

253
00:08:04,003 --> 00:08:07,152
and your E, you're kinda sloping down.

254
00:08:07,152 --> 00:08:07,985
- Yeah.

255
00:08:07,985 --> 00:08:09,676
- [Jared] Other than that,
it's really really good.

256
00:08:09,676 --> 00:08:11,444
- I have such a hard
time being consistent.

257
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,470
- [Jared] It looks really good.

258
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,609
- I can erase it and do it again.

259
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,921
- Do it, do it sister girl.

260
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:17,360
Show me that hand lettering.

261
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,577
- [Ellie] So wait, should I erase C and E?

262
00:08:19,577 --> 00:08:20,679
- [Jared] C and E and then yeah,

263
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,111
make 'em the same size as your--

264
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:23,897
- This is what I really
do like about Jared,

265
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:27,216
he'll be like that's great,
but I want help, you know?

266
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,049
- [Jared] Yeah.

267
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,693
- I didn't see it, to be honest.

268
00:08:29,693 --> 00:08:31,110
So there's the A.

269
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:36,003
- You just want it to be
on that line right there.

270
00:08:36,004 --> 00:08:38,559
Penny, one thing that
is very true about labs

271
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,617
is that you shed way too much.

272
00:08:40,618 --> 00:08:42,456
I mean look at this, look at this.

273
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:43,965
I'm outside with Penny.

274
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:44,831
We're in the garage.

275
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:47,202
We are going to clean up her dog bed.

276
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:48,346
We're gonna vacuum the inside,

277
00:08:48,346 --> 00:08:49,523
we're gonna vacuum that,

278
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:50,770
wash it, and I'd like to do

279
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,664
a little before and after.

280
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,208
This is kind of gross, I know,

281
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,117
it's dog hair, it happens,

282
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,925
we have to get used to it a little bit.

283
00:08:56,925 --> 00:08:57,933
But we've actually been really good

284
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,448
at maintaining the dog
hair inside the house.

285
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:03,498
We brush Penny a lot and
it's been really good

286
00:09:03,498 --> 00:09:06,229
throughout the house but
her dog bed, where she--

287
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:08,304
(crashing)

288
00:09:08,304 --> 00:09:10,452
But the dog bed, that's where Penny sleeps

289
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,517
has tons of hair

290
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:15,053
and we just want to clean it up for her

291
00:09:15,053 --> 00:09:17,165
so it's not staying on her,

292
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,309
that excess hair is not staying on her

293
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:20,236
wherever she goes.

294
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,069
So we're gonna clean it up

295
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:23,295
and I'll do a before and after.

296
00:09:23,295 --> 00:09:26,045
(scraping cloth)

297
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:42,964
(vacuuming)

298
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,897
Hey.

299
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:52,960
Is that your bed?

300
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,559
Are you not letting me get on your bed?

301
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,860
Do you want me to clean it for you?

302
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,581
(Jared laughs)

303
00:09:57,581 --> 00:09:59,053
And here is the after.

304
00:09:59,053 --> 00:10:02,183
Oh my gosh, doesn't it
look like brand new?

305
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,244
That is amazing.

306
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:04,415
If I get a little bit more hair off,

307
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,328
I think I'm gonna actually
throw it in the washing machine

308
00:10:06,328 --> 00:10:07,433
and let it dry and everything

309
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:09,441
and then it'll look like brand new.

310
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,435
Come here Jackson, look.

311
00:10:11,435 --> 00:10:13,518
Listen, do you hear that?

312
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:16,332
- Yeah.

313
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,915
- What do you hear?

314
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:21,027
I don't hear anything else.

315
00:10:21,027 --> 00:10:22,789
Do you know what that means?

316
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,622
- No.

317
00:10:23,622 --> 00:10:25,632
- [Jared] Your rock tumbler is done.

318
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:26,571
Should we go get it?

319
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:27,528
- And my rocks?

320
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:28,851
- [Jared] Yeah.

321
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,918
Well they're done with the cycle.

322
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:32,918
Let's go get 'em and see
what they look like, okay?

323
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:33,983
- Okay.

324
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:35,745
We should go get them.

325
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,078
- Okay.
- We should get them.

326
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,080
- It stopped.

327
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,680
- [Jared] It stopped, yeah.

328
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,973
Okay let's go look.

329
00:10:45,973 --> 00:10:47,705
They're in there.

330
00:10:47,705 --> 00:10:49,289
- I can't wait to see 'em.

331
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:50,122
- Me either.

332
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:53,026
So we have Jackson's
rock from the first cycle

333
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:53,922
and it's right here,

334
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:56,834
so we can compare it to
the rocks in this cycle.

335
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:58,104
We've got some bowls that we're gonna

336
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,582
pour everything into,

337
00:10:59,582 --> 00:11:00,970
and then we'll be able
to see what they're like.

338
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,608
Oh I need to get the sifter,

339
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,375
so we can get the water out, okay?

340
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,054
Okay, I'm gonna open 'em up.

341
00:11:06,054 --> 00:11:06,999
- [Jackson] Okay.

342
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,562
- [Jared] Are you sure you want to hide?

343
00:11:08,562 --> 00:11:09,490
- [Jackson] Yeah.

344
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,629
- [Jared] Why do you want to hide?

345
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:13,471
- [Jackson] Because I
don't want to see them yet.

346
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,526
- [Jared] Okay.

347
00:11:14,526 --> 00:11:15,359
- [Jackson] Have you opened?

348
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:16,192
- [Jared] Not yet.

349
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,463
Okay, it's open.

350
00:11:17,463 --> 00:11:18,296
- Ewwww.

351
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:20,686
- [Jared] Does it stink?

352
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:21,519
- Yeah.

353
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:34,652
Those are not good enough.

354
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,248
- [Jared] Oh that does stink, huh?

355
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:37,259
So now what I'm gonna do

356
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,843
is I'm gonna rinse some
water over the top of this--

357
00:11:39,843 --> 00:11:40,676
- Okay.

358
00:11:40,676 --> 00:11:42,031
- [Jared] into this bowl, so
we can see what they look like.

359
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:42,864
- Okay.

360
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:44,004
I'm gonna hide again.

361
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:44,947
- [Jared] Okay.

362
00:11:44,947 --> 00:11:46,753
Here we go Jackson.

363
00:11:46,753 --> 00:11:48,924
- [Ellie] Those are beautiful.

364
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:49,860
- What?

365
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,036
- [Ellie] This is so fun.

366
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:53,874
- What do you think?

367
00:11:53,874 --> 00:11:55,172
- Do you like 'em?

368
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,337
- How did they get like that?

369
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,641
- They're polished.

370
00:11:58,641 --> 00:11:59,926
Where's your other one?

371
00:11:59,926 --> 00:12:01,703
Oh look, this is a good comparison.

372
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:04,081
Look at this one, next to this one.

373
00:12:04,081 --> 00:12:06,287
So this was the first round.

374
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:07,481
And this was the second round

375
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:10,057
and I think these are the similar stones.

376
00:12:10,057 --> 00:12:10,890
Isn't that incredible?

377
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,723
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

378
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,306
This is fun for me.

379
00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:17,035
Jackson what kind of rocks are in here?

380
00:12:17,035 --> 00:12:18,100
Look.

381
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,111
- That's Calvin's favorite color.

382
00:12:21,111 --> 00:12:22,301
What the?

383
00:12:22,301 --> 00:12:24,543
- [Ellie] Oh this is my favorite.

384
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:25,460
- What the?

385
00:12:26,615 --> 00:12:29,539
- That's beautiful.
- That looks so cool.

386
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:31,746
- We should get one more.

387
00:12:31,746 --> 00:12:32,912
- [Ellie] Look at those.

388
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:34,853
Okay or even like this, 'cause they're--

389
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,520
- Whoa look at that.

390
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,679
Show them that.

391
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,429
- I want to do all of them.

392
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,829
- Look at that detail and dimension.

393
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,824
- I wanna do all of them.

394
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:48,727
I'm gonna do all of them.

395
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,749
- [Ellie] Do you want
to keep all of them out?

396
00:12:50,749 --> 00:12:52,071
- I'm gonna keep all of them out.

397
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:54,714
- [Ellie] You can, but
let's do it one more time,

398
00:12:54,714 --> 00:12:56,854
so that they're really shiny.

399
00:12:56,854 --> 00:12:58,553
So you chose one.

400
00:12:58,553 --> 00:13:01,612
- This one, because
this one's even shiner.

401
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:03,504
- Look at these rocks.

402
00:13:03,504 --> 00:13:05,587
Look how glossy they are.

403
00:13:06,838 --> 00:13:09,877
- [Ellie] And we still have
two more times to buff 'em.

404
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,827
- This is so cool.

405
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,400
And I think the biggest part,

406
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,056
the coolest part about this,

407
00:13:15,056 --> 00:13:16,097
is that we have a refill pack,

408
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:17,465
so we'll be able to see them

409
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:19,715
from the very beginning

410
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,864
to what they are in the last stage.

411
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:22,194
- We should put these in my jar.

412
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:24,857
- That looks like wood on a guitar,

413
00:13:24,857 --> 00:13:26,865
like that's so cool looking.

414
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,097
- I'm gonna get you friends.

415
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:30,761
Got you.

416
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:32,011
Ha ha, got you.

417
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:36,114
I farted on your guys.

418
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:37,036
(laughs)

419
00:13:37,036 --> 00:13:38,163
Excuse me.

420
00:13:38,163 --> 00:13:41,265
- We've got the next grit,
number three all set up

421
00:13:41,265 --> 00:13:42,886
and we've gotta let it go for seven days,

422
00:13:42,886 --> 00:13:45,969
that's one full week, okay?

423
00:13:45,969 --> 00:13:46,802
- Okay.

424
00:13:46,802 --> 00:13:49,709
- Hold on, let's get the days first.

425
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:50,542
Count with me,

426
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:55,217
one two three four five six
- one two three four five go--

427
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:56,884
- six seven.
- seven.

428
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,316
- [Jared] And?

429
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:00,739
- Blast off!

430
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,120
- [Jared] Pkkkkkkwwwwww.

431
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,138
(tumbler humming)

432
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,386
- Okay, one week and we'll be looking

433
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,932
at them again okay?

434
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:07,765
- Okay.

435
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:08,700
- [Jared] Say bye rocks.

436
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,533
- [Jackson] Bye rocks.

437
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,485
- Have fun.

438
00:14:10,485 --> 00:14:12,701
Boy today rocked, didn't it?

439
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:13,957
Did you see what I did there?

440
00:14:13,957 --> 00:14:16,045
Because we just did the whole rock thing

441
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:19,734
with Jackson and his
rocks, and today rocked.

442
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,327
So, jokes aren't as funny, when you have

443
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:23,160
to explain them Jared.

444
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:26,591
They're not as funny.

445
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,487
(sighs)

446
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:29,773
