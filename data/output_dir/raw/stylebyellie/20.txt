1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:01,741
â™ª Very excited â™ª

2
00:00:01,741 --> 00:00:03,110
(Ellie laughs)

3
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,943
Gosh!

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,766
- This is amazing.

5
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:07,760
- It's just really sweet.

6
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,247
Thanks Julie.

7
00:00:09,247 --> 00:00:11,610
- Dad, we don't go to sleep yet.

8
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,650
- Good morning Ellie.

9
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,690
- Good morning.

10
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,990
- [Jared] Today is the big day.

11
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,931
- You know it's special
when Mom's making breakfast.

12
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:18,960
(Jared laughs)

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,900
- Today is the day that we are
officially announcing Bollie.

14
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,580
You guys probably already know this,

15
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,750
but for us, it is going live today.

16
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,690
And this is a huge day for us.

17
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,210
This is the start of something brand new

18
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,926
from the very beginning.

19
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,280
- I know I told Jared, how scared were we

20
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,640
when we were like, let's
do daily, every day.

21
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,260
- Yeah I feel even more nervous for this

22
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,160
than I am when we quit our jobs

23
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,180
and went daily vlogging full time.

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,620
- Well we've invested a lot, so,

25
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,333
maybe that's why.

26
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:53,850
- Hey can you guys do me a favor

27
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,000
and cross your fingers for us?

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,150
You slept so good.

29
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,089
Thank you for sleeping so good.

30
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:02,666
- So where's my cousins.

31
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:03,499
- What?

32
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:05,296
- Where's my cousins?

33
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:06,700
- Are they coming over today?

34
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,533
- [Ellie] I think they are.

35
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,690
- Oh my goodness.

36
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:12,330
I think they'll be here
in maybe 26 minutes.

37
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,350
That's like one Peppa Pig show.

38
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,183
- [Ellie] Look at that yawn.

39
00:01:15,183 --> 00:01:16,702
- We used to do that as kids.

40
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:19,520
When we asked my parents
how long something would be,

41
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,675
she'd be like that's one He Man show.

42
00:01:21,675 --> 00:01:23,090
(laughing)

43
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,390
- [Ellie] You want to help me?

44
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,223
- [Jared] Oh what a nice boy.

45
00:01:25,223 --> 00:01:27,550
- [Ellie] Okay, I'll let you
help me make breakfast, okay?

46
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:31,980
Making hash browns,
veggies, some sausage, okay?

47
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,190
Mr. Cal, you look like you have

48
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,352
a question mark on your face.

49
00:01:35,352 --> 00:01:36,281
(Ellie laughs)

50
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,354
- You doing okay?

51
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:38,187
- Mmm-hmm.

52
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:40,770
(bright music)

53
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:05,583
- The chocolate cake is done.

54
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,500
- Can I touch?

55
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,240
- [Ellie] A little, sure
not with your tongue.

56
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,016
No I said not with your tongue.

57
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:14,849
- Why?

58
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:15,682
- [Ellie] Because we're
not just gonna eat it

59
00:02:15,682 --> 00:02:18,720
and I don't want other
people to think it's gross.

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,650
That's not hot.

61
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,990
- Is it gross?

62
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,370
- [Ellie] No.

63
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,170
Okay, oh my gosh.

64
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,190
You guys finish that.

65
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,620
I'm gonna finish decorating the cake.

66
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,750
This is amazing.

67
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,100
Kids helping parents make cakes

68
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,000
is fun, but sometimes very overwhelming.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,860
He just shot his toy in
the cake, oh my gosh.

70
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,790
Okay let me wash it,

71
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,540
so that you can play with it.

72
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,810
Let's wipe your hands.

73
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,393
(bright music)

74
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,332
(laughs)

75
00:02:51,332 --> 00:02:53,156
I am so glad you're here.

76
00:02:53,156 --> 00:02:55,550
I thought, Cody's not here, is he?

77
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,383
- [Jared] No, nuh-uh.

78
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:57,216
- Just Boston?

79
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:58,247
I thought you were Cody.

80
00:02:58,247 --> 00:02:59,090
- [Jared] Ho ho!

81
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,660
- [Ellie] Ooh, wipe your own hand.

82
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,814
(laughing)

83
00:03:02,814 --> 00:03:05,680
- Did you catch some snot rockets?

84
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,110
- [Jared] I was grabbing
'em for the Nintendo's sake,

85
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,640
not for anything else, oh my gosh.

86
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,582
- Oh my goodness, what are you doing?

87
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:13,630
You made breakfast?

88
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,610
- Yeah, you don't have to
eat it if you don't want.

89
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,620
I don't know how good it's gonna be.

90
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,852
- Oh my gosh, that's so cute of you.

91
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:18,855
What?

92
00:03:18,855 --> 00:03:19,688
Is it someone's birthday?

93
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:23,289
â™ª Happy birthday to Bollie â™ª
- I have a birthday cake!

94
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,789
- Birthday Bollie!

95
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:26,531
(laughing)

96
00:03:26,531 --> 00:03:29,034
I was like who's birthday did I forget?

97
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:31,513
- I thought you came over for my party?

98
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:32,650
(laughing)

99
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,857
- [Jared] Did you forget my birthday?

100
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:35,405
- You're so cute.

101
00:03:35,405 --> 00:03:39,470
- The cake and the frosting
is all homemade, cocoa,

102
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,050
it's supposed to be really good.

103
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,883
- [Jared] Yep.

104
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:43,750
- Awww, so cute.
- How fun.

105
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,630
- But I didn't have a topper,

106
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,133
so I filled it with chocolate.

107
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,880
- That's alright.

108
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,260
- How many people does it take

109
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,790
to have a website go live?

110
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,400
I think all of us feel
like we're gonna throw up.

111
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,450
Jared's on the YouTube end,

112
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,870
and Joel's over there helping.

113
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,763
Bonnie's trying to figure out our--

114
00:03:57,763 --> 00:03:58,596
- Instagram,

115
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:02,200
- Instagram, Twitter and the website.

116
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,300
- I feel like I'm a chicken
with my head cut off

117
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,590
running around, like seriously at a loss.

118
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,930
- Well we have check list after check list

119
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:11,500
after check list and then
we're like oh yeah and this,

120
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,720
oh yeah and this, it's like never-ending.

121
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,450
- So we're making the
website live at 8:57 AM,

122
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,060
then Instagram will be
public, Twitter and Facebook

123
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,120
at nine AM.

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,400
What other things do we need to change?

125
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
The channel art?

126
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,733
- [Ellie] Channel picture.

127
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:30,570
- The channel picture.

128
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:34,220
That needs to be at 8:58 as well,

129
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,940
because that's gonna be, okay channel--

130
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,970
- Like I don't feel sick,

131
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,749
my stomach just hurts like I just--

132
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:39,837
- I just want room to breathe.

133
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:41,141
- Yeah yeah.

134
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,020
No that's the exact thing.

135
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,960
It's like oh my gosh, it's hot.

136
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,920
- It's like scoot over baby.

137
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,386
- Maybe we should open a window

138
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,691
to give us some circulation in here.

139
00:04:47,691 --> 00:04:49,187
- We probably should.

140
00:04:49,187 --> 00:04:50,224
(laughing)

141
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,462
- [Joel] We're all gonna
be passed out on the floor.

142
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:53,160
- Penny's over there
fartin' in the corner.

143
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,620
- It's hard to imagine
what it's like in this room

144
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,990
without having those
feelings in your stomach,

145
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,014
you know what I mean?

146
00:04:59,014 --> 00:04:59,847
- [Bonnie] Yes.

147
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:01,530
- Right now my heart is just pounding.

148
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,950
You guys just got something sweet,

149
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,825
who is it from?

150
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:04,658
- Mom.

151
00:05:04,658 --> 00:05:05,740
- Good luck today girls,

152
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,700
but I don't think you'll
need it, love Mom.

153
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,747
And it means a lot and
did you get the text?

154
00:05:10,747 --> 00:05:11,580
- Beau.

155
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,413
Yeah Beau said--
- Yeah Beau nd Emily.

156
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:14,420
- big day today, we're excited for you.

157
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,330
It's just really sweet that
the family's been so sweet

158
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,661
and supportive, whoa we're gonna cry.

159
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:20,820
(laughing)

160
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,731
- There's no crying in our business.

161
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:25,310
- There's no crying in Bollie.

162
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,242
- There's no boobin' in
Bollie, get it, cause of the--

163
00:05:28,242 --> 00:05:29,295
- I like it.

164
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,575
- You got the biggest boobs in the world

165
00:05:30,575 --> 00:05:32,900
that just made it, so.

166
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,920
- Yeah we pretty much cry at everything.

167
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,753
- Anything.

168
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:38,010
(laughing)

169
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,760
- My dad would say, he's like my mom

170
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,940
would cry at everything,

171
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,633
she cried at the grand
opening of the supermarket

172
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:45,797
on their street.

173
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:46,630
- Awww.

174
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,353
- Isn't she just special, she's fun.

175
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:50,272
- Maybe it was a really good supermarket.

176
00:05:50,272 --> 00:05:51,164
- It was her supermarket.

177
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,480
- It's a good supermarket.

178
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,690
- PS, I'm ordering two robes,

179
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,260
one for me, one for Aunt Patsy
and Aunt Julie's birthday.

180
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,093
- [Jared] Awww.

181
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:58,530
- It's already past, she'll have to wait.

182
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
That's cute.

183
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,140
- We're literally just
sitting here waiting.

184
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,360
I feel like everything is ready and--

185
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,290
- I feel like I need to slap everyone.

186
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,505
Wake up!

187
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,328
(laughing)

188
00:06:11,328 --> 00:06:14,182
- I should've expected that.

189
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:16,551
(mock crying)

190
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,328
- We're literally watching the clock.

191
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:19,161
- I know.

192
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,250
- We're watching the
clock, waiting for our cue,

193
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,413
we all have our jobs to do.

194
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:22,471
- That was your Dad.

195
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:23,950
He's all, no video today?

196
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,143
- Oh jeez.

197
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,178
(laughing)

198
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,509
- So annoying Dad.

199
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:30,180
- Go Grandpa.
- No.

200
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,600
- Don't you watch me on Twitter?

201
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,340
- We have six things that we have to do,

202
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,380
but we have to start it at 8:58,

203
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:38,630
because of emails and live and waaa.

204
00:06:40,095 --> 00:06:41,090
- This is exciting.
- Ahhh!

205
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,280
- I will just tell you this,

206
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,830
if the two of you are going to have

207
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,210
some type of Mom talk show,

208
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,526
I will be there for it.

209
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:47,359
- Awww.

210
00:06:47,359 --> 00:06:48,290
- The best part of your
vlog is when you just

211
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,060
talk to the camera and share your heart.

212
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,160
- Who said that?

213
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,524
- These are just Twitter comments.

214
00:06:52,524 --> 00:06:53,768
- [Joel] Yeah, that's 3433.

215
00:06:53,768 --> 00:06:55,480
- Aww Liz, you're great.

216
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,300
Okay.
- I'm gonna ball my eyes out.

217
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,540
- We're gonna get one sale

218
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,012
and I'm gonna ball my eyes out.

219
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:02,090
- Thanks Mom!

220
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:04,580
(laughing)

221
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,565
- Everyone look here and smile.

222
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:07,398
(laughing)

223
00:07:07,398 --> 00:07:09,364
We're live, okay.

224
00:07:09,364 --> 00:07:10,197
- Yes!

225
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:13,260
- We all feel like
we're going to throw up.

226
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,540
- We are, we're going
through and reading all

227
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,850
of our twitter comments

228
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,610
and I'm loving them.

229
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,590
I just figured we may as well sit here

230
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,560
with sweaty hands and nervous stomachs,

231
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,090
and say hi, even if we don't talk

232
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,200
and we're just sitting here.

233
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,190
- This is the icebreaker, I feel like.

234
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,840
- Yeah honestly it really is,

235
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,420
because I think it'll
either put us over the edge

236
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,750
and we'll all have heart attacks

237
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,350
or it'll kind of calm
us down as we do this.

238
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,183
- I think it's helping.

239
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,016
It's calming me down.

240
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:39,600
- It's either that or
it's the cold brisk wind

241
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,527
that's coming through the window.

242
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:41,720
- Yeah I'm like, can we close that window?

243
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,769
- It's currently 20 degrees outside

244
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,160
and we have the window open,

245
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,740
because we're so anxious.

246
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,850
Oh my gosh, there's almost 2,000 people

247
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,530
on our website right now.

248
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:52,870
- This means so much.
- That is crazy.

249
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,140
- And I think Julie's
comment is gonna make me cry.

250
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,253
She was the first on our Bollie page.

251
00:07:58,253 --> 00:07:59,086
(laughing)

252
00:07:59,086 --> 00:07:59,919
- Yay.

253
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,610
- Bonnie's cried, now it's my turn.

254
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,898
It's just really sweet, thanks Julie.

255
00:08:04,898 --> 00:08:06,348
We're crying.
- Ahhh!

256
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:08,030
- We just got a text from Ruby.

257
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,679
The whole family is texting us,

258
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:11,240
this is so awesome.

259
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,370
Yes, our hands are
sweaty, Mom's spaghetti.

260
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:15,480
Oh my gosh.

261
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,050
That's incredible, look,
3,600 live right now.

262
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,660
- It's like what on earth?

263
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,010
- [Jared] Almost 4,000
today, this is amazing.

264
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,100
Look at what you guys have done!

265
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,781
- I'm trying to like everyone's comment

266
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:26,630
- I know.

267
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,610
- so you know that I'm seeing it.

268
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,443
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

269
00:08:28,443 --> 00:08:29,840
- Just so hap--
(kiss)

270
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,610
- This is jaw dropping.
(chiming)

271
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,270
We have orders on the site.

272
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,770
- Erin, Jordan, Noelle, Lacy, Veronica,

273
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,620
Yasmin, Liz and Sabrina,

274
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,453
guys we're dying.

275
00:08:41,453 --> 00:08:43,780
- You guys are our first customers.

276
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,932
This is amazing.

277
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:48,720
- Oh my gosh.

278
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,553
Oh my gosh.
_ Liz.

279
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,041
- I'm trying to figure out

280
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,060
why my Dad hasn't bought anything yet.

281
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,315
- Yeah Dad.

282
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:56,040
- Oh my gosh!

283
00:08:57,492 --> 00:09:01,400
Honestly I was like what
if we don't get one sale.

284
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,487
- And then I thought well,

285
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,191
that was just a crazy year then.

286
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,530
(laughing)

287
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,928
- Worth it.

288
00:09:07,928 --> 00:09:10,173
- Thank you, thank you guys.

289
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:11,168
- Thank you so much.

290
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:12,001
- [Bonnie] Joely, do you see that?

291
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:12,834
- [Joel] Yes.

292
00:09:12,834 --> 00:09:14,733
- Yeah Mom!
- yeah!

293
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:16,116
(laughing)

294
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:16,949
- Thanks Mom.

295
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,100
- Your Mom bought your stuff.

296
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,848
Oh my gosh.

297
00:09:20,848 --> 00:09:23,970
My stomach is turning just
looking at this on the ground.

298
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,200
That is an empty BeanBoozled carton.

299
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,033
Do you know what that means?

300
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,770
- Ooh, they ate all the gross ones.

301
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,940
- [Jared] They ate all of them.

302
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,363
- I ate one earlier and I
was like, I don't know why,

303
00:09:34,363 --> 00:09:36,520
that's what his treat this week was.

304
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,567
And I was like no.

305
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:38,890
- What the heck?

306
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,801
Oh my gosh, did they eat them all?

307
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:41,634
- [Woman] They did.

308
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,240
Lincoln would take it out and be like ooh,

309
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,236
that's disgusting, and then I'd look over

310
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:45,670
and he'd put it in his mouth.

311
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,700
- And he'd put it right
back in, oh my gosh.

312
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,735
Boys did you eat all the
BeanBoozled jellybeans?

313
00:09:51,735 --> 00:09:52,568
- Yeah.
- Yes.

314
00:09:52,568 --> 00:09:53,980
- [Jared] Were they
good or were they nasty?

315
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,780
- There were the disgusting ones,

316
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,810
but that blue one was kinda sour.

317
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,600
- [Jared] Oh good, Jackson
what did you think?

318
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,825
They were all good?

319
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:01,980
- The blue ones were good.

320
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,930
- [Jared] The blue ones are good?

321
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,935
Which one tasted the bad, the worst?

322
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:06,032
- Scrambled eggs.

323
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:07,120
- The scrambled eggs?

324
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,310
Yeah the rotten eggs is
probably the worst one,

325
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,143
you could ever get,

326
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,830
if you've ever done the
BeanBoozled challenge.

327
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,040
We did the BeanBoozled challenge

328
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,690
for Jackson's third birthday.

329
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,380
I'll have that linked down below

330
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,422
for you guys to see.

331
00:10:18,422 --> 00:10:23,090
- One two three four.

332
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,820
- [Ellie] Wow, there is four.

333
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,033
- Careful.

334
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:26,908
(yelling)

335
00:10:26,908 --> 00:10:28,360
- You gotta tip it,
Jared you gotta tip it.

336
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,164
Give it up, give it up.

337
00:10:30,164 --> 00:10:32,430
- [Ellie] Can all you
kiddies blow this out

338
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,720
with all your patience

339
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,830
with Mommy and Daddy a
little crazy this year.

340
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,469
- We are celebrating the birth of Bollie.

341
00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:42,756
- Who's Bollie?

342
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:44,273
(laughing)

343
00:10:44,273 --> 00:10:47,200
- Bollie is our awesome clothing line.

344
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,514
- [Ellie] We're gonna sing Happy Birthday.

345
00:10:49,514 --> 00:10:53,488
â™ª Happy birthday to you. â™ª

346
00:10:53,488 --> 00:10:56,998
â™ª Happy birthday to you. â™ª

347
00:10:56,998 --> 00:11:01,982
â™ª Happy birthday dear Bollie â™ª

348
00:11:01,982 --> 00:11:05,399
â™ª Happy birthday to you. â™ª

349
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,070
(cheering)

350
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:13,096
â™ª Very excited â™ª

351
00:11:13,096 --> 00:11:14,329
Do do do do do do do

352
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:15,770
- [Ellie] What the heck

353
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:16,770
is going on?

354
00:11:17,689 --> 00:11:20,522
(Bonnie babbling)

355
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,710
(laughing)

356
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:26,840
â™ª And I'm Judy. â™ª

357
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,630
â™ª And I'm Judy. â™ª

358
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,310
- I just fed everyone chocolate cake

359
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,267
and I think--

360
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,105
- What's in this cake?

361
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:36,580
- And I think that everyone went crazy.

362
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,500
Did you eat the BeanBoozled challenge?

363
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,210
Did you get the rotten egg?

364
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,640
Bonnie is cleaning up my floor

365
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,060
and is going to town on,

366
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,698
I don't even know what she's singing.

367
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:47,293
â™ª Baby shark do do â™ª

368
00:11:47,293 --> 00:11:49,090
(laughing)

369
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,400
We are currently learning about teeth

370
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,520
and dentists and what the dentist will do

371
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,240
if you eat a ton of chocolate cake

372
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,336
and don't brush your teeth.

373
00:11:58,336 --> 00:11:59,817
- I want to eat the chocolate cake.

374
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:02,381
- You want to eat the chocolate cake?

375
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:05,381
(Calvin vocalizing)

376
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:08,630
- I want to take them out.

377
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,800
- [Ellie] And we are learning
that we need to always

378
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,633
brush our teeth.

379
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,780
Where's the toothbrush?

380
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,420
Yes, make sure to brush the teeth good

381
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,740
after you eat the cake.

382
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,680
Okay?

383
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,270
Is this what we do
every night and morning,

384
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,450
is we brush our teeth too?

385
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,470
- Touch this, that's the red.

386
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,747
- [Ellie] The red one?

387
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,498
- It's my red.

388
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:30,434
My red, this one, this one.

389
00:12:30,434 --> 00:12:33,160
- Wow, that's your red.
- My red.

390
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,870
- [Jackson] Brush brush brush.

391
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,280
- That looks awesome.

392
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,240
For dinner, we thought
we would go out and eat

393
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
or order in, but to be honest,

394
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,510
we don't have a lot of nerves

395
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,360
and I don't think anyone
has a huge appetite,

396
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,660
so tuna fish sandwiches for the win.

397
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,318
That is dinner tonight.

398
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,151
- Here you go one,

399
00:12:50,151 --> 00:12:51,130
- [Ellie] Something light.

400
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,963
- Three oh!

401
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,113
Two spins?

402
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:58,214
(laughing)

403
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,100
- [Ellie] Penny what happened?

404
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,600
- [Jared] Did it fall down the stairs?

405
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,540
- [Ellie] Oh no.

406
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
- [Jared] Is Jackson getting if for you?

407
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,260
- Woo, thanks Jacks.
- Yay!

408
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,168
- [Ellie] We won't throw
it downstairs again, huh?

409
00:13:11,168 --> 00:13:12,380
- Because she's nice.

410
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,453
- [Ellie] Yeah.

411
00:13:13,453 --> 00:13:14,286
(Ellie laughs)

412
00:13:14,286 --> 00:13:15,210
- [Jared] Because she's nice.

413
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,265
- [Ellie] What book do you want?

414
00:13:17,265 --> 00:13:18,798
- Dog book.
- Peppa Pig.

415
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,792
- [Ellie] The dog book?

416
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:20,675
Okay.
- No!

417
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:21,508
- [Ellie] What?

418
00:13:21,508 --> 00:13:22,480
Peppa Pig?

419
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,630
Oh you're stepping on
it, it's right there.

420
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,890
- No it's pig.

421
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,300
- That's Peppa Pig.

422
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,530
We're trying to find the
perfect Peppa Pig book.

423
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,181
I don't know where it went?

424
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,796
(harmonica playing)

425
00:13:36,796 --> 00:13:38,540
Beautiful song for bed.

426
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,230
Dad, what chapter of
book are we on tonight?

427
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,920
It's called Let's Go Shopping.

428
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,260
Did you do that on purpose?

429
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:48,060
- No, this is the next story in line.

430
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,202
- [Ellie] Okay.

431
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,270
- Peppa Pig puppy.

432
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,320
- [Ellie] He wants his other Peppa.

433
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,940
This is what we're reading right now.

434
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,800
- One morning, Peppa and her family

435
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,950
took a trip to the supermarket.

436
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,640
Peppa and George jumped out
of the car in excitement.

437
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,300
They loved visiting the supermarket.

438
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,450
- One two three four, I'm that many.

439
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,780
- Yes you are that many.

440
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,613
- Yeah.

441
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,514
- [Jared] She skipped off
to put them in the cart.

442
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,347
- It's already one o'clock.

443
00:14:09,347 --> 00:14:11,190
- Oh it's one o'clock, then
you should probably go to bed,

444
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,240
it's way past your bedtime.

445
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,648
It's past our bedtime too Mom.

446
00:14:13,648 --> 00:14:15,040
- One o'clock.
- Yes.

447
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,620
- [Ellie] I love you, my baby boys.

448
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,679
That's one way to sleep.

449
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,742
- Wake up.

450
00:14:20,742 --> 00:14:21,983
- Wake up.
- Wake up.

451
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:23,170
- Wake up.

452
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,570
- [Jared] Okay the clock
is blue, what do we do?

453
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,280
- Dad, we don't go to sleep yet.

454
00:14:30,396 --> 00:14:31,848
- [Jared] Is the clock yellow?

455
00:14:31,848 --> 00:14:32,681
- Yeah.

456
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:33,514
- Oh.

457
00:14:33,514 --> 00:14:36,200
- It is the end to a long journey.

458
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,710
We have finally been able to launch

459
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,160
and we just want to say
thank you guys for your love

460
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,150
and for your support.

461
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:44,630
We have loved today, we have
loved your interactions.

462
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,820
I can't wait to go to the warehouse

463
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,881
and pack up some items tomorrow.

464
00:14:48,881 --> 00:14:49,930
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.

465
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,670
- Most of all, we are so excited,

466
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,460
because this is just the beginning

467
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,903
and we have a lot of
huge ambitions and goals

468
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:58,550
that we want to hit

469
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,210
and we are just excited for the future.

470
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:05,250
And that is from us to you guys,

471
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,310
we cannot wait to see you guys tomorrow.

472
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,360
So do you want to say anything?

473
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,490
- Well I am just so excited

474
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,080
that we've been able to start this

475
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,810
and I cannot wait to see where we take it

476
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,420
and where we go with you.

477
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,130
- Thank you guys so much.

478
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,227
We'll see you tomorrow.
- We'll see you next time.

479
00:15:20,227 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
- Bye.
