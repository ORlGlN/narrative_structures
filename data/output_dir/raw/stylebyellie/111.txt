1
00:00:00,134 --> 00:00:01,106
(laughing)

2
00:00:01,106 --> 00:00:03,689
(bright music)

3
00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:07,315
- I need to go eat right now.

4
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:09,629
- I see Santa Claus.

5
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:11,759
- Because you are more manly.

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,326
- Oooh!
- What?

7
00:00:13,326 --> 00:00:16,159
- What?
(laughing)

8
00:00:17,933 --> 00:00:20,683
(stomping steps)

9
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:26,596
- [Jared] And here we have
in their natural habitat

10
00:00:26,596 --> 00:00:28,844
two beautiful young blonde ladies,

11
00:00:28,844 --> 00:00:31,404
cutting hair in the kitchen.

12
00:00:31,404 --> 00:00:34,076
You can see that they take
the strokes very seriously.

13
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,129
- I just did a little at the bottom.

14
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:38,576
- [Jared] Just a little at
the bottom, as she says.

15
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,440
We don't want to take too much off,

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,200
because that would be bad,

17
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,283
according to their style.

18
00:00:45,144 --> 00:00:45,977
Hi.

19
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:48,088
- Hi, good morning.
- Hello.

20
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:48,921
- [Jared] How are you?

21
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,098
- We've been up--

22
00:00:50,098 --> 00:00:51,639
- Since the crack of dawn.
- Early.

23
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,611
- Our kids woke up and like, can we eat?

24
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:56,147
I'm like, wait 'til the sun comes up.

25
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:57,629
It's 5:30.
- That was early.

26
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:00,005
- They seriously have
been playing all morning

27
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:02,027
downstairs, it was super cute.

28
00:01:02,027 --> 00:01:03,996
I got up at like six, saw them

29
00:01:03,996 --> 00:01:05,843
and they were all playing
and you were like--

30
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:07,011
- I was out.

31
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:08,308
Landon let me sleep in.

32
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:10,475
- Oh good Landon.
- He made breakfast.

33
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,252
That's so fun.

34
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:14,141
- Well I came up and I
pulled out a box of cereal,

35
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:16,089
and Landon's like, I already
fed them all breakfast.

36
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:17,426
So I went and got a diaper

37
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:18,259
and he's like,
- Yeah, it was

38
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:19,559
I already changed the diapers.
- Landon and I together.

39
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,595
- Landon and I did the dishes together.

40
00:01:21,595 --> 00:01:24,219
- [Jared] Aww, that's a sweet moment.

41
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,072
So you guys are doing your hair today,

42
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:27,759
what are we doing, tell
us what's going on.

43
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,397
So right now you've got about like

44
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:31,063
what 18 inches here?

45
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,105
- I know Julie's hair is so long.

46
00:01:32,105 --> 00:01:33,449
Come look at the ground.

47
00:01:33,449 --> 00:01:35,153
- [Jared] Okay, let's look at the ground.

48
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:36,490
- [Julie] Just a little trim.

49
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,015
- [Jared] Just a little trimmy trim.

50
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:38,989
It looks great.

51
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:40,414
Cuttin' about two inches off there?

52
00:01:40,414 --> 00:01:41,734
- More like four.

53
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:43,337
- [Jared] Four inches, make sure you just

54
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,477
don't round the corners
off too much, okay?

55
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,003
- I know, I was like
I'm worried for Bonnie

56
00:01:46,003 --> 00:01:47,898
to come and look at it.

57
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:49,239
Isn't that nice and straight?

58
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,231
- [Jared] It looks healthy
and crisp and great.

59
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,266
- Thank you.
- Good job.

60
00:01:54,266 --> 00:01:55,819
- This is worth the two hour car drive.

61
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,143
- There you go.

62
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,145
This is some kind of Chinese flute

63
00:01:59,145 --> 00:02:00,895
that we got in China.

64
00:02:02,793 --> 00:02:03,937
Where did we get it,

65
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,182
it's a Chinese flute,
but where did we get it?

66
00:02:06,182 --> 00:02:08,152
And this is the one
I've arranged things on.

67
00:02:08,152 --> 00:02:10,165
- [Ellie] Play it again.

68
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:12,833
(playing flute)

69
00:02:20,062 --> 00:02:20,895
- Nerd.

70
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,151
- [Ellie] Hey, I wake up
to that every mornin'.

71
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,815
(Ellie laughs)

72
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,732
- Jared, please serenade me to bed.

73
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:33,418
(flute playing)

74
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:34,825
- [Ellie] Oh my gosh.

75
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:35,810
- [Landon] Boo.

76
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,192
(laughing)

77
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:39,544
- [Ellie] Alright Penny's
hair, Julie's hair,

78
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:40,637
- [Jared] (laughs) Oh sick.

79
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,598
- [Ellie] Penny's hair, Julie's hair.

80
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:44,264
I'm gonna vacuum it up.

81
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:45,735
I wiped it up, most of it,

82
00:02:45,735 --> 00:02:47,708
but this will get rid of the little ones.

83
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:48,541
- [Julie] Yeah, so I--

84
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:49,513
(vacuum whirring)

85
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:50,936
- [Ellie] I'm not listening.

86
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:53,663
(Ellie laughs)

87
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,237
(vacuum whirring)

88
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,320
Calvin, does even Batman,

89
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:01,037
Batman is going to see Jesus, huh?

90
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,583
Is that cool?

91
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:08,021
Calvin has been sitting by
the tree most of the morning

92
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,277
playing with the nativity set.

93
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,061
And he brought the truck,

94
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,003
and he brought the marble,

95
00:03:14,003 --> 00:03:16,502
and Batman to come see Jesus too.

96
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:18,150
You're so fun.

97
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,518
You're so just quiet.

98
00:03:19,518 --> 00:03:22,191
Everyone's downstairs and
you're just playing by yourself.

99
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:24,038
I was getting ready with
Julie and I was like

100
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:26,231
I need to go eat right now.

101
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,958
I was like I eat breakfast everyday,

102
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,763
like I had oatmeal and
strawberries this morning

103
00:03:29,763 --> 00:03:32,723
and then at 10 o'clock I eat a meal,

104
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:34,578
like a pre-lunch.

105
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:37,216
And I came in the kitchen
and I looked at Jared

106
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,899
and I was like, oh look.

107
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:39,732
- Right on the dot.

108
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:41,934
- It's 10 o'clock.

109
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:42,767
It's 9:53.

110
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,865
I seriously was like, I
need to eat, I need to eat,

111
00:03:45,865 --> 00:03:47,947
so I'm eating some leftover soup

112
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:50,209
that Bonnie made last night for dinner

113
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:52,966
and I need to get it in
my belly in 2.5 seconds,

114
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,669
or I'm gonna start dry heaving.

115
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,817
(laugh-crying)

116
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:56,650
(laughs)

117
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,888
Is it way way hot?

118
00:03:57,888 --> 00:03:59,500
- It's a little warm.

119
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,258
- [Ellie] Aww.

120
00:04:01,258 --> 00:04:03,051
Let it cool off.

121
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:05,714
We have all the kids coloring.

122
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,154
They just got done watching a movie,

123
00:04:07,154 --> 00:04:08,793
we were like, watch a movie,

124
00:04:08,793 --> 00:04:09,633
we'll get ready.

125
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:11,137
Then the boys are gonna go to a movie,

126
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:13,220
and then we'll play
and entertain the kids.

127
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,485
So we're getting some
snacks out for the kids

128
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,788
and we're just coloring.

129
00:04:18,788 --> 00:04:20,509
You're doing your letters.

130
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:22,994
Are you gonna color one Coop?

131
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:23,827
Trace one?

132
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,720
Oh you did the train a little.

133
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,956
That looks good.

134
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:27,789
Ready?

135
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:29,897
Ready Cal?

136
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,184
My favorite store in town,

137
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:32,233
and I've never been here during Christmas.

138
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,648
- You haven't?

139
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,327
- [Ellie] It's beautiful,
all their decorations.

140
00:04:37,327 --> 00:04:38,492
(gasps)

141
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:40,303
Good thing I didn't bring my wallet Bon.

142
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,531
(laughing)

143
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:44,017
Look at how cute it is in here.

144
00:04:44,017 --> 00:04:45,905
I wanted to take you here,

145
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,355
and now we're here.
- I know.

146
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:48,768
(bell clanking)

147
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,018
(jingly festive music)

148
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:01,642
- I see Santa Claus.

149
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,225
- Are you gonna go with Calvin?

150
00:05:05,247 --> 00:05:06,080
- No.

151
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,126
- You don't want to go?

152
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:11,159
Do you want to go with
Jackson to see Santa?

153
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:12,383
- No.

154
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:15,133
- No, what are you gonna ask him?

155
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:19,672
- To get a jack-in-the box and

156
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:21,316
a Roc glider

157
00:05:21,316 --> 00:05:22,483
and a cowboy.

158
00:05:23,412 --> 00:05:25,995
I need I need one more one more

159
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:29,294
- [Ellie] Maybe a marble run?

160
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:30,127
- Oh yeah.

161
00:05:30,127 --> 00:05:31,764
- What are you gonna ask him for?

162
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:32,983
- Big cookie.

163
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:35,468
- A big cookie, is what Calvin wants.

164
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,313
And even asked about talking to Santa

165
00:05:37,313 --> 00:05:39,809
and hoping he can visit
some peoples' houses

166
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:42,531
that don't have any toys.

167
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:44,201
- Cookie, big.

168
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,034
- [Ellie] You want a big cookie.

169
00:05:46,034 --> 00:05:47,497
- Yeah, big cookie.

170
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:49,256
(Ellie laughs)

171
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,543
- This is fun to get out
with some of my sisters

172
00:05:51,543 --> 00:05:52,876
and the cousins.

173
00:05:54,943 --> 00:05:55,976
So fun.

174
00:05:55,976 --> 00:05:58,393
You are waiting so patiently.

175
00:05:59,584 --> 00:06:01,417
What are you thinking?

176
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:05,613
(Calvin vocalizing)

177
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:13,453
You're so quiet, are you a little nervous

178
00:06:13,453 --> 00:06:15,468
or are you excited?

179
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:16,301
- Excited.

180
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,538
- [Ellie] Good, do you
want to go talk to him?

181
00:06:20,538 --> 00:06:22,031
Okay.

182
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:24,125
Hi.
- Hello there.

183
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:25,899
- [Ellie] You want to
go sit up on his lap?

184
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,778
Not Calvin, here, you want to?

185
00:06:27,778 --> 00:06:29,000
- [Jackson] Yeah.

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,825
- [Santa] Good job, now up high.

187
00:06:30,825 --> 00:06:32,399
- Awesome.
- Down low.

188
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,232
- [Santa] Too slow.

189
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:35,317
(Ellie laughs)

190
00:06:35,317 --> 00:06:36,314
Good job.

191
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,851
- [Ellie] Did you ask him Jackson?

192
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,451
- What do you want for Christmas?

193
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:40,800
- Big cookie.

194
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,633
- [Ellie] Okay, that's what he wants,

195
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:44,158
is one big cookie and that's it.

196
00:06:44,158 --> 00:06:45,737
- And your big cookie.

197
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,072
- [Ellie] Jackson are
you on the nice list?

198
00:06:48,072 --> 00:06:50,563
He has been extra good.
- Of course he is.

199
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:51,689
- Of course he is.

200
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:53,043
- [Ellie] You've been good.

201
00:06:53,043 --> 00:06:54,305
Say thank you.

202
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,580
- Thank you.

203
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,471
Thanks for coming to see me Spiderman,

204
00:06:56,471 --> 00:06:57,721
I mean Jackson.

205
00:06:58,937 --> 00:07:01,027
- [Ellie] Okay, let's go.

206
00:07:01,027 --> 00:07:02,468
Thank you.
- Take care.

207
00:07:02,468 --> 00:07:03,718
- [Ellie] We'll see ya.

208
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:04,551
- Bye bye.

209
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,885
Give me five again.

210
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,815
(Ellie laughs)

211
00:07:07,815 --> 00:07:10,482
(festive music)

212
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:33,131
- Why do you have reindeer?

213
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,458
- Why do I have reindeer?

214
00:07:34,458 --> 00:07:35,291
- Because they fly his sled.

215
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,038
- Then I don't have to buy gas.

216
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:38,591
They can even go faster than airplanes.

217
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,585
(bells jingling)

218
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:41,410
- Even faster than cars?

219
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,074
- [Ellie] Oh totally.

220
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,273
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye bye.

221
00:07:45,273 --> 00:07:47,184
- Alright, so this is
the situation we're in.

222
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:48,969
The guys just got back from the movie.

223
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,184
We went and saw Thor.

224
00:07:50,184 --> 00:07:51,939
Awesome, it was so good.

225
00:07:51,939 --> 00:07:53,331
Now we're doing a little switcheroo,

226
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:54,684
and a little swaperino,

227
00:07:54,684 --> 00:07:56,222
the girls are out doing something

228
00:07:56,222 --> 00:07:58,068
and the guys are left here with the kids.

229
00:07:58,068 --> 00:08:00,697
We've got Cody, Boston, Emma, Olivia,

230
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:03,614
Calvin, Cooper, Jackson and Porter.

231
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:06,050
And it's just us two.

232
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:07,712
- I know we are outnumbered.

233
00:08:07,712 --> 00:08:09,660
- It's eight versus two.

234
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,528
So, what should we do.

235
00:08:11,528 --> 00:08:13,839
- Good thing we're strong like Thor.

236
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,672
(growling)

237
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:16,557
- He gets to watch the girls,

238
00:08:16,557 --> 00:08:18,257
you get to take care of the boys.

239
00:08:18,257 --> 00:08:20,211
- [Jared] That does not
sound like even fairness.

240
00:08:20,211 --> 00:08:22,805
- Because you are more manly.

241
00:08:22,805 --> 00:08:24,112
- What?
- Ooooh!

242
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:27,594
- What?
(Olivia laughing)

243
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,500
- [Jared] Do you kids
want to play a video game?

244
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,333
- [All] Yeah.

245
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,240
- [Jared] Do you want to play Mario Kart?

246
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,302
- [All] Yeah!

247
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:33,982
- [Jared] Landon, what
do you think about that?

248
00:08:33,982 --> 00:08:34,815
- Perfect.

249
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,649
- Okay.

250
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,203
Alright, let's go downstairs.

251
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:38,410
- Mario Kart, yeah!

252
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,457
- We're having a Mario Kart tournament.

253
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:40,978
Well I feel like the entertainment issues

254
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,467
have been solved.

255
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:44,019
You guys having fun playing Mario Kart?

256
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:44,852
- Yeah.
- Yep.

257
00:08:44,852 --> 00:08:45,852
- [Jared] Who's winning?

258
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:47,110
- I won.
- Me.

259
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,759
- [Jared] Whoa, multiple winners.

260
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:52,601
Cooper are you having fun?

261
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:53,776
You're so into it, huh?

262
00:08:53,776 --> 00:08:55,272
I love the Nintendo Switch.

263
00:08:55,272 --> 00:08:58,671
It's the best console
for multiple reasons.

264
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:00,111
Not because the graphics are the best,

265
00:09:00,111 --> 00:09:01,919
but because it's portable,

266
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,096
you can take it anywhere,

267
00:09:03,096 --> 00:09:05,317
and it comes with two controllers.

268
00:09:05,317 --> 00:09:07,812
These tiny little guys that Jackson has,

269
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:09,517
that's a controller

270
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,365
and then Cooper has the other one,

271
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:12,516
those are the controllers.

272
00:09:12,516 --> 00:09:14,373
So out of the box it has two controllers

273
00:09:14,373 --> 00:09:16,926
and that's a huge plus, I think.

274
00:09:16,926 --> 00:09:18,741
Of course, I like the PlayStation,

275
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:19,574
of course, I like the Xbox,

276
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:20,450
those are awesome too.

277
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,782
And I like PC Gaming too.

278
00:09:21,782 --> 00:09:23,890
But I have played more
on the Nintendo Switch

279
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,690
than any other console this year.

280
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,241
What have I said?

281
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,810
There is nothing better than
hearing a little kid laugh.

282
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,351
(raspberries)

283
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:36,181
(laughing)

284
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:37,952
(raspberries)

285
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,014
(laughing)

286
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,214
(muffled raspberries)

287
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,890
(laughing)

288
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,723
- No.

289
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:47,556
- Yeah.

290
00:09:47,556 --> 00:09:48,389
- No.

291
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:49,222
- One more time.

292
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,055
- No.
- Yes.

293
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:50,888
- No.

294
00:09:50,888 --> 00:09:52,285
- Okay.

295
00:09:52,285 --> 00:09:55,034
(growling)
(laughing)

296
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:55,867
- No.

297
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:56,700
- No more?

298
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,533
- No.

299
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:58,366
- One more?

300
00:09:58,366 --> 00:09:59,199
- No.

301
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:00,032
- Two more?

302
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:01,212
- No.
- No more?

303
00:10:01,212 --> 00:10:02,052
- No.
- Okay.

304
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:04,015
(growling)
(laughing)

305
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:04,848
- No.

306
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,866
- Can you say, I love you Dad.

307
00:10:07,866 --> 00:10:09,295
(vocalizing)

308
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:13,462
(laughing)
(kissing)

309
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,833
- [Ellie] What is he gonna have?

310
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,500
- Calvin has a question for you.

311
00:10:20,204 --> 00:10:22,413
Well, are you gonna ask her?

312
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,830
Come on, ask her.

313
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:26,805
- Mommy bed?

314
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:30,053
- [Ellie] What?

315
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,842
- Bed?

316
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:33,954
- [Ellie] You in my bed?

317
00:10:33,954 --> 00:10:35,604
- Yeah.

318
00:10:35,604 --> 00:10:37,346
- He wants to sleep in our bed.

319
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,977
- [Ellie] I'm not gonna lay with you.

320
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:39,810
- No.

321
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,005
- [Ellie] You lay in my
bed and stay in bed okay?

322
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:42,838
- Mmm-hmm.

323
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,688
- 'Cause I wanna talk to my sisters.

324
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:47,530
(laughs)

325
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,985
And if this is gonna keep you quiet,

326
00:10:49,985 --> 00:10:50,985
we'll do it.

327
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:54,321
- I'm trying to find the
quietest place in the house,

328
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:55,714
so I don't disturb anyone right now.

329
00:10:55,714 --> 00:10:57,647
And it just so happens
to be the pantry I think.

330
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,521
I hope I don't wake anyone up.

331
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:02,268
Everyone is asleep and the night is over,

332
00:11:02,268 --> 00:11:04,056
so thank you guys so much
