1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,540
- I don't care if your foot's numb.

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,900
I am going to great lengths
to make this video happen.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,528
- [Quiet Voice] Did he see us?

4
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:07,588
- (whispering) No.

5
00:00:07,588 --> 00:00:09,440
- That's a weird sound. What is that?

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,227
- Ellie threw out all of my clothes.

7
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:14,020
(laughing)

8
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:16,067
- Good morning, boys.
How are you this morning?

9
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:16,900
- Good.

10
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,680
- [Jared] Good. Jackson,
did you know that today

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,840
you're getting your
pictures taken at preschool?

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,744
- Yeah.

13
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:25,030
- You look very, very sharp today.

14
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,563
What are you gonna wear
during your pictures?

15
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,290
- You wanna wear your sunglasses?

16
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,440
Let's see them on, bud.

17
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,063
Yeah, buddy. Give me a cool pose.

18
00:00:38,153 --> 00:00:40,500
(laughing)

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,610
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls, you saw it here first.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,050
That is a cool pose, huh Cal?

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,050
Okay, let's go to school.

22
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,143
Show me your cool walk to the car.

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,593
Yeah, buddy. Doing our
cool walk to the car.

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,603
Okay, buddy, show me your
best preschool smile.

25
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,660
Thumbs up and everything.

26
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,093
One more. One big smile.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,330
There we go, that's my boy.

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,450
You have a wonderful day at school today.

29
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,272
I love you very much.

30
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:21,105
- Hey, a fire hydrant.

31
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,062
- Good job. All right,
it's closing. We're home.

32
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:28,796
Are we home? Whose house is this?

33
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:30,310
- Mine
- Is this your house?

34
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,153
- My house.

35
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,150
- I don't care if your foot's numb.

36
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,820
I am going to great lengths
to make this video happen.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,516
I am a great producer, okay?

38
00:01:40,516 --> 00:01:43,053
- We are doing a hair tutorial.

39
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:47,306
- [Jared] Wait, did you just
say, "Be a goddess," Bonnie?

40
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,764
Girls. Goddess mode.

41
00:01:49,764 --> 00:01:52,327
- Stop looking like such a frump.

42
00:01:52,327 --> 00:01:54,821
- Stop touching your hair.
It's annoying in every video.

43
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:56,631
- So, what we have, we're doing the,

44
00:01:56,631 --> 00:01:58,620
or they're doing the hair tutorial video.

45
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,760
We grabbed the extension cord,
we grabbed the power strip,

46
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,400
they've got all of their curling stuff,

47
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,570
we grabbed this giant
mirror so they could see.

48
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,910
The giant mirror was
slipping so we grabbed this

49
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:10,340
to keep it up, but then the
bottom kept slipping out,

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,946
so we grabbed this and
propped it up against that.

51
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:16,500
This tripod wasn't working,
so we got the bar stool.

52
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,870
The bar stool is hum, so we
put the book underneath it,

53
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,444
and I tilted it just down a little bit,

54
00:02:20,444 --> 00:02:23,710
and now we've got our shot.

55
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,746
- It smells like burning hair spray.

56
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,316
- [Jared] Yes, it does.
Okay, I'm gonna hit play.

57
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,036
Sound speed.

58
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:31,210
- Action.

59
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,147
- [Jared] Give us a good clap.

60
00:02:33,147 --> 00:02:33,980
(clapping)

61
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,170
- No just one good clap.

62
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:38,130
(laughing)

63
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,280
Okay, I'll do the clap.

64
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,838
- Here, I got the clap.

65
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:44,088
(laughing)

66
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:51,050
- [Jared] Did we get that? We got it.

67
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,609
Action.

68
00:02:53,609 --> 00:02:55,130
I just got out of the
shower, because you guys know

69
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,970
that I was a little stinky,
and my hair was a disaster,

70
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,776
it still is a disaster, but
I'm listening to Moondance.

71
00:03:01,776 --> 00:03:04,360
I heard it in the car, and I haven't heard

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,350
this song in such a long time.

73
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,730
I used to play it in jazz band

74
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,020
when I was in middle school, or something.

75
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,910
One of my favorite songs.

76
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,688
Van Morrison does a great job with it.

77
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:15,630
Michael Buble does a good job with it.

78
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,130
Lots of people do a good job with it,

79
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,128
but that's not the point I want to make.

80
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:23,130
I weighed myself on the
scale, and you guys know

81
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,270
a few videos ago, Ellie
threw out all of my clothes.

82
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,160
We donated all of them,

83
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,450
and I haven't been drinking Dr. Pepper.

84
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:32,770
I still love Dr. Pepper, but
I haven't been drinking it.

85
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,097
I've been drinking water
and carbonated water.

86
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:39,347
I stepped on the scale, and
it's only been two weeks or so,

87
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:42,560
but I've lost six pounds,
and I was just like

88
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,165
that's incredible to me.

89
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,430
I was so stunned and shocked by that.

90
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,350
Six pounds, that's pretty significant

91
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:51,650
by making one small change
like that, so, I don't know.

92
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,980
I think I should recognize
a little victory like that,

93
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,400
and I can't wait to
continue doing that forward.

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,430
By the way, Ryan and
I had this discussion.

95
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,610
He said, "La Croix and
Bubly taste the exact same,"

96
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,689
and then he had Bubly.

97
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,009
Tasted quite a bit better.

98
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,392
I've been drinking Bubly,
and I kind of like it.

99
00:04:06,392 --> 00:04:08,401
If you have any other drinks that you like

100
00:04:08,401 --> 00:04:10,750
that are really healthy, let me know

101
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,583
in the comments down below.

102
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:13,840
Other than water, of course.

103
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,423
(upbeat music)

104
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,280
- We are done.

105
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,540
After, like, 30 phone calls,

106
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,930
we finally have our last photo shoot

107
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,663
done.

108
00:04:42,663 --> 00:04:43,760
- And scheduled.

109
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,060
That was difficult getting
everyone scheduled.

110
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,910
- My calendar looks, like, trashed.

111
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,910
- Now we need to find something to wear.

112
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,430
- I think one of the hardest
things about the cookbook

113
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,680
is getting everyone
scheduled on the same page.

114
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,627
There are five kids in Ellie's family

115
00:04:59,627 --> 00:05:02,000
and then Ellie's parents,
so you're working with

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,890
seven couples, trying to get
everything on the same day,

117
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:07,260
the same time, the same
outfit, the same food,

118
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,710
the same recipes, all
of that all together,

119
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,506
but the last photo shoot
is finally scheduled.

120
00:05:12,506 --> 00:05:16,260
- And babies are coming, so
we have to plan around babies.

121
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,823
- [Jared] Yes, so bring
lots of extra outfits.

122
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:21,070
- It's our birthday month next month.

123
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,200
- That's what you meant.

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,330
I thought you meant just the
kids in our family are coming.

125
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,100
No, we have three babies in
our family that are coming

126
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,970
that we have to have this done before.

127
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,770
This baby, Julie's baby and Emily's baby.

128
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,603
Can you believe that?

129
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:35,301
Speaking of babies, we've
got a bump box over there

130
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,560
that you need to open.

131
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,941
That's a weird. What is that?

132
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:42,658
Do you guys hear that?

133
00:05:42,658 --> 00:05:45,578
It's water, but it's louder than normal.

134
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,160
Oh my gosh, Penny and I are on a walk.

135
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,099
Penny, let's go, and we're here

136
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:49,932
right when they turned on all the water.

137
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:54,932
Look, it's coming down
the stream right now.

138
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,030
This is crazy.

139
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,590
This is the first day of Spring,

140
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,360
and look, all of this is dry.

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,500
This is a little creek
that they're going through,

142
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,250
but look, the water's
coming down right now.

143
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,200
They opened up.

144
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,600
Penny, do you see the water?

145
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,503
Do you see it? There it is.

146
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,563
Oh my gosh, what perfect timing.

147
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,083
Get it, Penny, get it!

148
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,030
Good girl. How cool is this?

149
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,330
What do you think, Penny?
Is that pretty cool?

150
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,550
- [Ellie] Pregnant person!

151
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:26,889
Hi baby. Holy shiz.

152
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:29,654
(laughing)

153
00:06:29,654 --> 00:06:30,571
Your belly.

154
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh

155
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,030
my

156
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,863
gosh.

157
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:36,750
There's mine.

158
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:41,750
Julie, oh my gosh, yours
is, Lucy, good heavens girl.

159
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,524
- I know, she's taking a toll on me.

160
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:49,330
- Julie, your belly is, I
think it just crazy popped

161
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,923
since last I saw you.

162
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,990
- You're so cute.

163
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:56,973
- First, Julie looks beautiful.

164
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,240
I can't believe you have a
basketball in your stomach.

165
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,220
We're looking at bags because

166
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,231
Julie's trying to find a bag.

167
00:07:03,231 --> 00:07:05,280
This is the cutest bag. I like it.

168
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,020
- I think I like them to be
able to go over my shoulder

169
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,470
just so I don't have to
worry about keeping it

170
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,370
up on my shoulder.

171
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:22,020
- Pregnancy mamas are
here, and Albion was doing,

172
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,650
they sent an Instagram out the other day

173
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,413
that they were doing a
bath bomb making night,

174
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,530
and I signed up right away,
and I texted all the girls.

175
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,870
I said, "If you can come,
come, if you can't, you can't,"

176
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,973
and we got the best of us here.

177
00:07:37,161 --> 00:07:39,744
(upbeat music)

178
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:47,840
Bathology has come to Albion
and we have bath bombs,

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,380
and we are mixing a ton of scents,

180
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,680
and we are creating our
own scents for them.

181
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,848
This is right up my alley, and
I need to take it all home.

182
00:07:55,848 --> 00:08:00,070
They gave us a pamphlet that
you can buy your own products,

183
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,830
have your own scents on them,
and I'm just like in heaven.

184
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,490
- Listen here, sonny.

185
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,834
You are back from school, and
you had picture day today.

186
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,520
Can you show me what you
did for your pictures?

187
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,010
Stand up for me. Stand up.

188
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,443
Stand up, young son.

189
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,779
(laughing)

190
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:22,943
You gotta stand up or I'll keep tickling.

191
00:08:22,943 --> 00:08:25,943
(playful screaming)

192
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,732
Are you gonna stand up?

193
00:08:29,732 --> 00:08:30,899
- Yeah.
- Okay.

194
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,283
Show me what you did for your
picture in preschool today.

195
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,002
- I said.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,010
- [Jared] Oh beautiful.

197
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,600
That's what you did for your picture?

198
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,510
Did you do anything else?

199
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,978
Did you take more than one picture?

200
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:45,811
- I did.

201
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,530
- Oh my goodness.

202
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,498
Mama's gonna be so happy
to see that picture

203
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:55,728
and have it immortalized forever

204
00:08:55,728 --> 00:09:00,728
for your second preschool picture ever.

205
00:09:00,924 --> 00:09:01,960
That was a good picture.

206
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,210
Hey, do you guys wanna know something?

207
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,043
Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:09,020
(laughing)

209
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,490
Hey, I have an idea.

210
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,510
Let's go do that to Calvin.

211
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,537
We gotta sneak up on him.

212
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:17,813
Did he see us?

213
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:19,729
- No.

214
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:21,240
- Okay, let's go, let's go.

215
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,073
- Okay.

216
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,413
- He's so unsuspecting.

217
00:09:29,427 --> 00:09:30,578
- You come with me.

218
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:32,828
- [Jared] Yeah, I'm coming.

219
00:09:35,073 --> 00:09:36,673
I don't think he's seen you yet.

220
00:09:39,324 --> 00:09:41,871
He spotted you. Tickle him!

221
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:43,880
Tickle him! Tickle him!

222
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,432
Tickle him! Tickle him!

223
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,682
(laughing)

224
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:54,230
Hey boys, guess what, guess what?

225
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,770
Here's what I'm thinking.

226
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:57,670
Mom is at a class right now.

227
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,640
She's doing something fun
for her and her sisters.

228
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,670
It is just us boys tonight,
and you know what that means?

229
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,470
We get to have a little
party. Pizza party.

230
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,789
Do you guys want pizza for dinner?

231
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:11,910
- Yeah!

232
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,780
- [Jared] Calvin, do you
want pizza for dinner?

233
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,097
- Yeah.

234
00:10:16,097 --> 00:10:17,493
- [Jared] Okay, can I borrow some money?

235
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,670
Thank you. I'm just gonna
borrow this for pizza, okay?

236
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,871
Can I borrow this for pizza tonight?

237
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,507
- Can I have some coins?

238
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:26,890
- [Jared] I'm gonna take that as a yes.

239
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:29,223
You're just gonna take the
whole register. Perfect.

240
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,720
Ta-da.

241
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,170
Are you guys ready to dig in?

242
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:39,630
- Yeah, but there's no cheese.

243
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,290
- There's lot of cheese on that.

244
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,740
Lots of cheese and pepperoni.

245
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Wait, wait, wait, whoa, hey
we need to wash your hands,

246
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,780
say a prayer, cut these
into little slices,

247
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,860
and then you can have some, okay, bud?

248
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,690
Thank you very much.

249
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,060
Okay it makes sense.

250
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,700
The kids are in bed, and
Ellie is on her way home,

251
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,750
so that is where we are
going to end our night.

252
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,100
Thank you so much for watching.

253
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,351
If you enjoyed the video,
give it a big thumbs up,

254
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:05,810
and we will see you guys next time.

255
00:11:05,810 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
