00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:03,705
(Christmas themed music)

2
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:19,774
- Yes!

3
00:00:21,295 --> 00:00:22,398
- Kiddos.

4
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:23,231
- Hi.

5
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,404
- Do you know what we're doing today?

6
00:00:24,404 --> 00:00:25,237
- Yeah

7
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:26,456
- [Ellie] What are we doing?

8
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:29,076
- Going to the fire station.

9
00:00:29,076 --> 00:00:30,067
- [Ellie] We are?

10
00:00:30,067 --> 00:00:33,317
We are gonna go celebrate firefighters!

11
00:00:34,957 --> 00:00:35,790
- Why?

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,604
- [Ellie] because they work so hard.

13
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:39,874
And do you know that
they are on call a lot,

14
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,812
they have to work, a lot and sometimes,

15
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:44,570
they don't get to be with their
families as much as we do.

16
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,298
So we're gonna go tell them thank you.

17
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:48,415
- Sometimes they don't
get to spend Thanksgiving

18
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:50,314
and Christmas with their families

19
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,383
because they're working for us.

20
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,288
- What about the fire?

21
00:00:52,288 --> 00:00:53,121
- That, that's right!

22
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:55,005
They have to be all ready for fires.

23
00:00:55,005 --> 00:00:56,997
Sometimes they miss being
with their families,

24
00:00:56,997 --> 00:00:59,127
so we're gonna make sure
that they get a chance

25
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,651
to be with their families today and

26
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,987
we're gonna make that happen.

27
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:06,070
I remember working retail and I would

28
00:01:06,945 --> 00:01:10,163
miss out on all of these
family parties and--

29
00:01:10,163 --> 00:01:11,710
- [Ellie] or be late.

30
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:16,655
- And I would be late and that's
just like a small fraction

31
00:01:16,655 --> 00:01:19,009
of what these guys go through,
like they miss so much

32
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,877
because of their duty, what they do.

33
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:23,301
And it's so honorable
and it's so incredible,

34
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:25,014
but family is so important to us,

35
00:01:25,014 --> 00:01:27,004
and I know it's so important to them.

36
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,307
- [Ellie] and that's why
they do what they do.

37
00:01:28,307 --> 00:01:29,881
- Yeah, exactly.

38
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,330
We love to give back during the holidays,

39
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,265
but there's only so much
that Ellie and I can do

40
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,596
on our own and so we're
excited to announce our

41
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,366
partnership with T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls, and HomeGoods

42
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,737
to help make all of this happen.

43
00:01:41,737 --> 00:01:44,718
Family means so much to them,

44
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:45,983
that we wanted to do this.

45
00:01:45,983 --> 00:01:46,930
They make sure that

46
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,284
they don't have their
employees work on the holidays.

47
00:01:49,284 --> 00:01:51,416
And we're so excited
to be working with them

48
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,506
and we're gonna make this party happen

49
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,011
we're gonna bring these families together

50
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:58,240
with their firefighter spouses
and it's gonna be great!

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,831
- And they don't know about it

52
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:00,779
- [Jared] It's a surprise!

53
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:02,604
- [Ellie] So that's what's
gonna be really fun.

54
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:03,437
- Its a surprise!

55
00:02:03,437 --> 00:02:04,638
Okay, you boys ready to get going?

56
00:02:04,638 --> 00:02:05,494
- Yeah!

57
00:02:05,494 --> 00:02:06,327
- [Ellie] Okay.

58
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:07,160
- [Jared] Should we go have a party?

59
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,993
- Yeah.

60
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:08,826
- [Jared] Yeah.

61
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:10,108
- [Ellie] We're gonna eat
some food and we're gonna

62
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,858
give them some gifts.

63
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,244
- Yeah we are.

64
00:02:14,244 --> 00:02:17,494
(holiday themed music)

65
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:24,116
We're here at the Pie
Dump, this is where the

66
00:02:24,116 --> 00:02:27,404
firefighters love to
hangout, before, after shifts

67
00:02:27,404 --> 00:02:29,326
and we're setting it up
and we're almost done

68
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:30,357
with everything.

69
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:31,825
- That's a soccer ball
- Soccer ball ornament!

70
00:02:31,825 --> 00:02:32,658
- [Jared] Yeah!

71
00:02:32,658 --> 00:02:35,168
The kids are getting everything
set up on the Christmas tree

72
00:02:35,168 --> 00:02:37,215
and we've got all these gifts for

73
00:02:37,215 --> 00:02:40,128
the firefighters' kids down here.

74
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,591
This is so cool.

75
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,124
Are you guys putting
ornaments on the tree?

76
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:43,957
- Yep!

77
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:44,790
- [Jared] Good!

78
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,623
You're such good helpers!

79
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,472
You're like Santa's little elves!

80
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:48,305
- I love this.

81
00:02:48,305 --> 00:02:50,386
- [Jared] This is the room where

82
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:52,755
the magic is gonna happen.

83
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,277
Yeah! (laughs)

84
00:02:55,277 --> 00:02:57,743
These are the magicians,
to make everything happen.

85
00:02:57,743 --> 00:03:00,167
All these kids are gonna
get all of these gifts.

86
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:01,000
Isn't that cool?

87
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,833
- Yes.

88
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:02,675
- [Jared] The families are about

89
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:04,320
to walk in and we are about to

90
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,309
surprise the firefighters.

91
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:07,830
Like, that's gonna be cool.

92
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:08,663
- [Ellie] Firefighters don't know

93
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:09,655
that their families are here.

94
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:10,488
- [Jared] Mhmm.

95
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:11,321
- So the families are eating,

96
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,563
they're gonna come here and then when

97
00:03:12,563 --> 00:03:14,865
the firefighters walk
in, they're gonna see

98
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:15,743
all their family!

99
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:17,108
- [Jared] It's a big surprise!

100
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:17,941
I love surprises!

101
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:18,989
There's no promises here,

102
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,797
but I may get emotional and start crying,

103
00:03:20,797 --> 00:03:22,395
so if I do that, you
gotta be my back up, okay?

104
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:25,368
- Oh no, I totally will,
I totally will too.

105
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,951
(upbeat music)

106
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:51,056
- [Jared] Hey everyone!

107
00:03:51,056 --> 00:03:52,773
So, the firefighters are almost here,

108
00:03:52,773 --> 00:03:54,626
so lets kind of like, make a semi-circle,

109
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:56,924
a semi-circle of awesomeness and

110
00:03:56,924 --> 00:04:00,045
surprise and we'll welcome
them all in here together.

111
00:04:00,045 --> 00:04:02,878
- [Woman] Okay, they're walking in

112
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,813
Here they come!

113
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,884
- [Child] Daddy!

114
00:04:06,884 --> 00:04:07,717
- [Jared] Surprise!

115
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:10,967
- [Woman] Hi! (laughs)

116
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,938
- Yay!
(clapping)

117
00:04:14,938 --> 00:04:17,605
(holiday music)

118
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:35,709
Jackson, you are doing so
good with the snowflake!

119
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:38,079
You're following the lines and everything.

120
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,162
Good job bud!

121
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,691
We've got cookies that we're decorating,

122
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:44,781
we've got gingerbread houses, we've got

123
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,929
a hot chocolate bar, this is so fun.

124
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,126
All these families are getting together.

125
00:04:49,126 --> 00:04:51,793
(holiday music)

126
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,163
Alright, you guys ready?

127
00:05:37,163 --> 00:05:38,877
- [Kids] Yeah!

128
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:43,098
- Open your presents! (laughs)

129
00:05:43,098 --> 00:05:45,843
and I'll get some people,
we'll hand these out

130
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,510
(holiday music)

131
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:57,028
Oh my goodness!

132
00:05:57,028 --> 00:06:00,879
It feels like Christmas morning. (laughs)

133
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,896
Is this fun guys are you having fun?

134
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:03,729
- Yeah!

135
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:05,153
- [Jared] Good!

136
00:06:05,153 --> 00:06:06,736
This is so awesome.

137
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:09,305
Oh my goodness.

138
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:11,224
Yeah, grab some socks.

139
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:12,057
Awesome.

140
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:16,243
- (laughs) That's why I don't talk much.

141
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,178
- Ellie just got really emotional

142
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,338
We're making these gift
baskets to give back

143
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,427
to those who are less fortunate,

144
00:06:22,427 --> 00:06:23,975
who don't have the gloves, the socks,

145
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:27,681
the blankets, the mugs to stay warm.

146
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:29,190
Just the basic things that everyone

147
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,582
needs to have to stay
warm during the winter.

148
00:06:31,582 --> 00:06:33,880
So we have these baskets, and we're doing

149
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,636
a little assembly line and putting

150
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,433
all these baskets together for everyone.

151
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,038
Ellie you are cute, you know that?

152
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:41,083
- So that hat would be perfect there.

153
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,268
- [Jared] You're cute getting all

154
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:44,037
emotional about that, you know?

155
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,232
- [Woman] and the little red wagon

156
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:46,781
is perfect for the fire department.

157
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,459
- There you go!

158
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,476
And there it goes! (laughs)

159
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:51,309
- [Man] Do you hear that?

160
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:52,856
- Merry Christmas.

161
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:54,046
- [Jared] Santa!

162
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,860
(cheering)

163
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,110
(gentle holiday music)

164
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,277
- It is soft isn't it?

165
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,339
- [Jackson] Why do you have a beard?

166
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:31,023
- Well that keeps my face warm

167
00:07:31,023 --> 00:07:35,525
- [Jared] Is there anything
else you wanna ask Santa for?

168
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:37,030
- A jeep patrol.

169
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,239
- A jeep patrol?

170
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,072
- [Jared] Ooh!

171
00:07:39,072 --> 00:07:39,905
- [Ellie] One last thing,

172
00:07:39,905 --> 00:07:41,669
do you wanna tell him
what you're grateful for?

173
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,202
Are you grateful for anything?

174
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,150
Are you grateful for your brother?

175
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,200
- [Jared] and your family?

176
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,450
- [Ellie] Okay.

177
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:50,164
- [Jared] Okay, hop down.

178
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:51,195
- [Jared] Say thanks Santa!

179
00:07:51,195 --> 00:07:53,438
- Thanks Santa. (laughs)

180
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:54,355
- Ho ho ho!

181
00:07:56,461 --> 00:07:58,940
- We just got home, the kids are in bed,

182
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,838
and we are quieting down for the evening.

183
00:08:01,838 --> 00:08:04,974
That is a wrap on our weekend filming

184
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:07,579
with T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods

185
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:11,940
for the local firefighters,
the awesome party that we had,

186
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,133
I hope, hope that everybody truly had fun.

187
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,401
I enjoyed it.

188
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,630
I enjoyed seeing the
families meeting them,

189
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,497
hearing them, talking to them,

190
00:08:21,497 --> 00:08:22,960
seeing the kids interact and play.

191
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,800
This has been a very fun couple of days.

192
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,076
- What was the most
magical part for you today?

193
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:29,909
- Ooh!

194
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:30,742
- There were two parts where

195
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:33,046
I could, I was just like holding back

196
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,713
the emotions, is when
the families first saw

197
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:42,227
their spouses, the firefighters
coming in through the room.

198
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:44,986
And how excited their kids
were to see their parents.

199
00:08:44,986 --> 00:08:45,819
- [Ellie] Their parents, yes!

200
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,926
- Like that just like,
oh, my heart strings!

201
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,960
And then when we had our special guest,

202
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,381
Santa come in.

203
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,302
That was a surprise even for us.

204
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:55,308
We didn't know he was coming until today.

205
00:08:55,308 --> 00:08:56,141
You know?

206
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:56,974
He's got a busy schedule!

207
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:57,807
- It was!

208
00:08:57,807 --> 00:08:59,183
The whole, all the kids,

209
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:01,426
it wasn't like screaming
and crazy chaotic,

210
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,975
it kind of just all got quiet and

211
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:07,458
it was just, it was a very
nice ending to the evening.

212
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:10,562
- It was very special when
that happened, like yeah.

213
00:09:10,562 --> 00:09:12,098
Thank you for coming along behind

214
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,703

215
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:17,169
We want to thank T.J. Maxx,
Marshalls and HomeGoods

216
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:20,164

217
00:09:20,164 --> 00:09:22,253

family is such a core part

218
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,507
of their values.

219
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:25,652
Because it is so important to us.

220
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,605
