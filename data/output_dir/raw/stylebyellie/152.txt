1
00:00:00,535 --> 00:00:03,110
- [Jackson] Do you want
to play hide and seek?

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:04,148
- [Calvin] No.

3
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:05,565
- [Jackson] Okay.

4
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:10,576
- I don't know if you can hear the kids

5
00:00:10,576 --> 00:00:11,847
down there playing.

6
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:13,862
But Jackson goes Calvin, do
you want to play hide and seek?

7
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:15,731
And Calvin goes no.

8
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,132
And Jackson goes okay.

9
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:20,420
I'm gonna head out, slip
out before they see me,

10
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,875
I'm gonna go get my hair done,

11
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm gonna get it trimmed and freshened up.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,833
Video's up.

13
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:27,887
- Video's up, working
on some special videos

14
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:29,310
for this week, because I mentioned

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,584
we'll have some other videos

16
00:00:30,584 --> 00:00:32,067
going up next week, so.

17
00:00:32,067 --> 00:00:33,765
- Woo hoo, have fun.

18
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:34,662
- Thanks, love you.

19
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:35,495
Have fun getting your hair done.

20
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:36,328
- Thanks.

21
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,480
- Hey you know what?

22
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,127
Just go have fun and relax

23
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:40,822
and take all the time that you want, okay?

24
00:00:40,822 --> 00:00:42,390
- Why are you so cute to me?

25
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,695
- Because I love you and I want you

26
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,006
to have time for yourself

27
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:46,239
and just
- Well thanks.

28
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,072
- I'll take care of the kids

29
00:00:47,072 --> 00:00:48,109
and we'll have fun, okay?

30
00:00:48,109 --> 00:00:49,109
- [Ellie] Okay.

31
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:50,021
You have fun.
- I love you.

32
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:50,854
- I will.

33
00:00:50,854 --> 00:00:51,916
- You do a little challenge with the kids.

34
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,287
- Ooh that sounds fun.

35
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,514
- [Ellie] Remember when I
snuck into my mom's house.

36
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,610
Remember when Bonnie
was so funny that day?

37
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,663
(Ellie laughs)

38
00:00:58,663 --> 00:00:59,680
- So here's the deal.

39
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,668
Last night I made dinner.

40
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:02,388
Did not do any of the clean up.

41
00:01:02,388 --> 00:01:03,581
The kitchen's a disaster.

42
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:04,605
I'm gonna clean up,

43
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:05,748
so I've got the kids downstairs,

44
00:01:05,748 --> 00:01:07,099
they're playing, they're
having a fun time.

45
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,268
They're like sliding across the trampoline

46
00:01:09,268 --> 00:01:10,546
onto a mat, it's hilarious.

47
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:11,720
I'll show you that in a second.

48
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,807
But I've got tons of
stuff to clean up here

49
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:14,640
in the kitchen.

50
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,275
So let's initiate a fun montage.

51
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:18,287
Oh I know just the thing, hold on.

52
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,688
Okay google, play some cool music.

53
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:22,001
- [Computer Voice] Sure,
here's a Google Play

54
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,576
music radio mix, based on
the cool jazz one playlist.

55
00:01:24,576 --> 00:01:27,115
- Cool jazz, I like that very much.

56
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:28,228
Now we can start cleaning.

57
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:29,765
Let's get this place cleaned up

58
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:30,716
before Ellie gets home.

59
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:32,169
That's the goal.

60
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:35,252
(bright jazzy music)

61
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:01,016
Do you boys want to know what
song popped into my head?

62
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:02,264
- Yeah.

63
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:03,486
- Yeah.

64
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:04,654
- Head, nose.

65
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:07,392
- Is that your head and nose?

66
00:02:07,392 --> 00:02:08,783
An old song popped into my head

67
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:10,846
that I haven't sung in
a very very long time.

68
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:11,790
And Jackson you might know it,

69
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,640
But Calvin you might not remember it.

70
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,144
It goes a little something like this,

71
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:19,512
♫ Corn dogs corn dogs

72
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:23,112
♫ They are so good to me

73
00:02:23,112 --> 00:02:24,312
♫ Corn dogs

74
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:25,562
Ring any bells?

75
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:27,986
(laughing)

76
00:02:27,986 --> 00:02:30,883
Well at any rate, guess what guys?

77
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:32,354
I found these in the freezer,

78
00:02:32,354 --> 00:02:36,316
so we're gonna have some
corn dogs for lunch.

79
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:37,355
Does that sound good?

80
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,188
- Yeah.

81
00:02:38,188 --> 00:02:39,209
- [Jared] Okay, let's have some corn dogs.

82
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:41,424
What is it Penny?

83
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,839
You okay?

84
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:44,589
She senses something.

85
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,995
Oh my gosh Penny, you are going crazy.

86
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:49,578
Oh off off off off.

87
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:54,210
She is so excited about something.

88
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,578
(barking)

89
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:56,495
What is it?

90
00:02:57,483 --> 00:02:58,316
(barks)

91
00:02:58,316 --> 00:02:59,877
Is it outside?

92
00:02:59,877 --> 00:03:02,851
(Jared laughs)

93
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:04,395
She's never like this.

94
00:03:04,395 --> 00:03:07,660
She's going crazy and
she never barks inside,

95
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,657
and she is holding it
back as much as she can,

96
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:10,824
but she can't.

97
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,193
You okay, huh?

98
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,233
I think I know what it is.

99
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,634
I think I know why she's acting this way,

100
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,192
but I want to double check first.

101
00:03:18,192 --> 00:03:19,723
We might as well call
him chameleon Calvin,

102
00:03:19,723 --> 00:03:21,263
because he's adapting to every move

103
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:23,294
that Penny is making.

104
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:24,622
Are you a puppy?

105
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,800
Come here puppy, come here puppy dog.

106
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,054
Hi puppy dog.

107
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,486
Have you been a good boy?

108
00:03:31,486 --> 00:03:33,236
That's a good doggie.

109
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:39,651
My suspicions were correct.

110
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,674
So this is what's going on.

111
00:03:40,674 --> 00:03:41,789
Penny is going crazy,

112
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,197
she's barking a lot outside,

113
00:03:43,197 --> 00:03:44,496
she's running just back and forth,

114
00:03:44,496 --> 00:03:46,759
like you guys saw earlier.

115
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,623
I told Ellie what was happening

116
00:03:48,623 --> 00:03:50,823
and I was like I wonder
if our neighbor's dog

117
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,423
is having puppies today.

118
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:53,986
So Ellie texted our neighbors

119
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:55,797
and that is actually true.

120
00:03:55,797 --> 00:03:58,435
They have eight puppies right now

121
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:01,647
and Penny either heard the puppies

122
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,758
or she just sensed it.

123
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,485
Yeah, she just sensed it.

124
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:06,516
- [Ellie] She's excited.

125
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:08,602
- Yeah, she's so excited right now.

126
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,160
- Did your friend have puppies?

127
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,243
You played with her, huh.

128
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:15,298
Yeah, that is so fun.

129
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:17,081
- [Jared] It is fun, it's really exciting.

130
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,488
- We don't want her barking.

131
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:21,365
So she's gonna be in,
- yeah.

132
00:04:21,366 --> 00:04:22,954
- we will watch her a little closer.

133
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,164
- Yeah, those are brand new puppies

134
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:26,174
and we want to make sure they're comfy

135
00:04:26,174 --> 00:04:29,124
and our dog isn't barking
all over the place.

136
00:04:29,124 --> 00:04:30,074
Is that fun?

137
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:34,301
Did you best friend get
puppies, is that right Penny?

138
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,324
She's like there's food on the table now.

139
00:04:36,324 --> 00:04:38,600
Everything else is less of a priority.

140
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,225
Nothing else matters,
there's food on the table.

141
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:43,865
- I got my hair done.

142
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:46,083
- How do you love it?
- It was good.

143
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,897
- She just rimmed it a little.

144
00:04:47,897 --> 00:04:49,096
- [Jared] Is there a little color to it?

145
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:49,929
- A little color, so it should.

146
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,262
- It looks a little brighter, a little

147
00:04:51,262 --> 00:04:52,982
- I came home and everyone
was having corn dogs

148
00:04:52,982 --> 00:04:53,815
and I was like
- Yes.

149
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:54,809
- I'm gonna make myself some lunch.

150
00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,216
- Hey, corn dogs are good.
- It was good.

151
00:04:57,216 --> 00:04:59,071
- Yeah, for when Mom's gone,
that's what's fun, right?

152
00:04:59,071 --> 00:05:00,534
- [Ellie] Yeah exactly.

153
00:05:00,534 --> 00:05:01,516
Ellie your hair looks amazing.

154
00:05:01,516 --> 00:05:02,349
- Thank you.

155
00:05:02,349 --> 00:05:05,396
- Like I really do like
that shoulder length bob?

156
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,187
- Lob, that's what people call it.

157
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:08,490
- [Jared] A lob?

158
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,323
Is that what they call it?

159
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,156
- Yeah.

160
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:10,989
- Just lob it over the plate,

161
00:05:10,989 --> 00:05:12,252
just lob it over the
shoulders, that's all.

162
00:05:12,252 --> 00:05:14,023
- Alright well let's try this again.

163
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,709
Calvin, do you want to wear your costume?

164
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,211
- [Calvin] No.

165
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,289
- He doesn't want to wear it.
- He just said no.

166
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:22,184
- Okay well I guess Calvin just is

167
00:05:22,184 --> 00:05:23,390
It's so weird to me.

168
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,582
Do you guy shave kids that don't want

169
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:27,031
to wear Halloween costumes?

170
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:28,870
- I always wanted to.
- Is that normal?

171
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,377
- I feel like all kids want to wear them.

172
00:05:32,377 --> 00:05:34,589
Calvin, should we put your costume on?

173
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:35,422
- No.

174
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:36,366
- [Jared] What about Batman?

175
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:39,448
Do you want to wear a Batman outfit?

176
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:42,781
Do you want to wear your Batman costume?

177
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,806
That piqued his interest.

178
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:44,964
- [Ellie] Okay should I
hurry and go find something?

179
00:05:44,964 --> 00:05:46,134
- Let's go get his Batman costume.

180
00:05:46,134 --> 00:05:48,244
- He wore it last year.

181
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:49,327
Oh, you okay?

182
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:52,035
- He slipped and fell down.
- Someone fell.

183
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:54,320
- [Jackson] He fell down Dad.

184
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,354
- I don't know if it'll fit him,

185
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,075
but we might be able
to squeeze him into it.

186
00:05:57,075 --> 00:05:58,244
Come here, we gotta go Jackson,

187
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,555
I gotta tell you where we're going.

188
00:06:00,555 --> 00:06:03,055
Okay Calvin, look what I have.

189
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:04,936
- What?

190
00:06:04,936 --> 00:06:07,059
- [Ellie] Do you want Minion?

191
00:06:07,059 --> 00:06:08,214
- No.
- Come here.

192
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,047
- [Ellie] He wants Batman.

193
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,630
Do you want Batman?

194
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,583
- Do you want Batman?

195
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:14,868
- No Minion.

196
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:16,499
- No Minion.

197
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:18,690
- You want Batman?

198
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,605
Look see Batman?
- Come here.

199
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:22,444
- [Jackson] Do you want the Batman one?

200
00:06:22,444 --> 00:06:24,349
- [Jared] Batman.

201
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:27,741
- Okay I'm not fighting it, whatever.

202
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,868
- [Jared] You'll just go as Calvin.

203
00:06:29,868 --> 00:06:30,701
(laughing)

204
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:32,456
- That's crazy to me.

205
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:34,118
Alright, do you want me to
tell you where we're going?

206
00:06:34,118 --> 00:06:36,862
We're going to the church Halloween party.

207
00:06:36,862 --> 00:06:37,950
- Woo!

208
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,783
- What?

209
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,599
That's creepy.

210
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:41,656
- [Ellie] That's creepy?

211
00:06:41,656 --> 00:06:42,489
- Yeah.

212
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,880
- Are you excited?

213
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,873
- Yeah.

214
00:06:48,873 --> 00:06:49,897
- I'm excited.

215
00:06:49,897 --> 00:06:51,665
We brought a bunch of
snickerdoodle cookies.

216
00:06:51,665 --> 00:06:54,057
- He always says that's amazing

217
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:55,557
or he'll say what?

218
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:58,625
I've never heard that's creepy.

219
00:06:58,625 --> 00:06:59,769
Okay let's go.

220
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,779
- [Jared] This is our first
activity of the party.

221
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:04,321
- Dad can you hold these?

222
00:07:04,321 --> 00:07:05,326
- [Jared] Yes I can hold these.

223
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:07,739
Okay Jen is gonna show
us how to do this okay?

224
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:08,572
- So what you're gonna do is

225
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:11,031
you're gonna pick up one
of these ping pong balls,

226
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:11,958
and you're gonna try to get it in the cup.

227
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,128
You gotta stand on the line, okay?

228
00:07:14,128 --> 00:07:14,986
- Is this water pong?

229
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:16,304
Are we playing water pong?

230
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:18,506
(Jared laughing)

231
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,258
- Okay try to make it into the red cups

232
00:07:20,258 --> 00:07:21,700
or the green cups.

233
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:25,033
- [Jared] Ooh that was close, try again.

234
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:29,073
Yay he got it in a red one.

235
00:07:31,181 --> 00:07:32,348
Best day ever.

236
00:07:33,446 --> 00:07:35,847
- Let me have this one.

237
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:36,962
- [Jared] Nice.

238
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:38,251
So let's pick a duck.

239
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,294
Let's see.

240
00:07:39,294 --> 00:07:42,255
Does it have a dot on the bottom?

241
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,992
(Jared laughing)

242
00:07:44,992 --> 00:07:47,585
Oh, just one duck, he ate all the ducks.

243
00:07:47,585 --> 00:07:48,763
Can you believe that you have won

244
00:07:48,763 --> 00:07:50,159
every single game that
you boys have played,

245
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,439
isn't this incredible?

246
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,441
- Want to play more games.

247
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:53,274
- [Jared] Guess what?

248
00:07:53,274 --> 00:07:54,228
That's what we're gonna do.

249
00:07:54,228 --> 00:07:56,311
- More games, more games.

250
00:07:58,334 --> 00:08:00,417
- [Ellie] Good job Jacks.

251
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:08,538
- [Man] You guys are naturals.

252
00:08:08,538 --> 00:08:09,883
- [Ellie] What?

253
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:10,716
Bye Mr. Jacks,

254
00:08:10,716 --> 00:08:11,966
have fun.
- Bye.

255
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,059
- Da da.

256
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:15,817
Da!

257
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,943
- Hey ya, are we both in our thermals?

258
00:08:20,943 --> 00:08:21,776
- No.

259
00:08:21,776 --> 00:08:22,609
- No?

260
00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:25,611
Look, I'm wearing a onesie.

261
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:29,028
And look, my butt even has a little flap.

262
00:08:30,163 --> 00:08:31,583
I picked this up today,

263
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:34,034
I think I'm gonna do a little haul but

264
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:35,837
I love that we're both
wearing little thermals.

265
00:08:35,837 --> 00:08:37,920
- Owie, it's an owie bum.

266
00:08:38,903 --> 00:08:41,421
- You got an owie on your bum?

267
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,967
- Mommy owie.

268
00:08:42,967 --> 00:08:45,126
- I put an owie on your bum?

269
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:45,959
- Yeah.

270
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,798
- Are you telling
- Mommy

271
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:49,528
(laughing)

272
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:51,658
You got an owie on your bum
when you were in the tub,

273
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:53,408
'cause you fell, huh?

274
00:08:54,364 --> 00:08:55,364
- Mommy bum.

275
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,374
- [Ellie] My bum?

276
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,207
- Mommy.

277
00:08:58,207 --> 00:09:00,707
- And I have a flap on my bum.

278
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:02,795
Come here.

279
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,666
Hey, come here.
- Where did Dad go?

280
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,402
- [Ellie] Where did Dad go?

281
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:08,235
- Home.

282
00:09:08,235 --> 00:09:10,750
- We had a blast at our church party.

283
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,411
Jared and Jackson actually
went to the pumpkin walk

284
00:09:13,411 --> 00:09:15,069
to watch Grandpa sing again,

285
00:09:15,069 --> 00:09:17,383
and it was getting late
and it is really cold,

286
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:19,143
so I thought that it would be good

287
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:20,520
to put Calvin to bed and for me

288
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,603
to just sit for a minute.

289
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,770
(footsteps)

290
00:09:28,422 --> 00:09:30,105
Okay go to your night routine.

291
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:32,306
Jump on the bed, pick out a book.

292
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,889
So what book are we gonna read?

293
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,267
It's Pumpkin Day Mouse.

294
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:40,322
I used to read that
all the time to Jackson

295
00:09:40,322 --> 00:09:41,235
and he laughed.

296
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:43,362
I think Jackson was about this age

297
00:09:43,362 --> 00:09:45,267
when he would laugh so hard

298
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:49,274
at the boo part, so let's
see if Calvin laughs as hard.

299
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:53,048
Mouse has seven pumpkins to decorate.

300
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:56,760
Mouse paints a happy face on this pumpkin.

301
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,427
This pumpkin is sad.

302
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:03,185
Mmmm, one of these pumpkins are missing.

303
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,090
Eek!

304
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,090
What's that?

305
00:10:06,618 --> 00:10:07,451
Eek!

306
00:10:09,217 --> 00:10:10,467
Isn't it silly?

307
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,354
Wow.

308
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:14,683
Boo!

309
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:17,706
The dog made a scary pumpkin.

310
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:19,098
- Yeah.

311
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:22,848
- Now it's time to make friendly pumpkins.

312
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:25,271
Are they painting eyes?

313
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:26,104
- Eyes.

314
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:27,922
- Happy Pumpkin Day mouse.

315
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:28,755
- Eye.

316
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,458
Sad.

317
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,615
- [Ellie] Sad?

318
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:33,532
- Yeah sad.

319
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:36,549
- [Ellie] Aww he's sad.

320
00:10:36,549 --> 00:10:37,466
- Yeah sad.

321
00:10:38,457 --> 00:10:40,262
- [Ellie] Yeah, and he's happy.

322
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:41,760
Are you sad?

323
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,593
- No.

324
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:44,277
- Before I end the vlog, I just wanted

325
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,566
to tell Christine thank you so much

326
00:10:46,566 --> 00:10:49,681
for saying hi to me while
I was in town today.

327
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,657
Meeting you guys, it truly does

328
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,889
make it fun for Jared and I,

329
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,922
because it puts a face to a name

330
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:59,049
and in person and it really is special.

331
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:02,966
Tomorrow Jared and I have
an extra special day.

332
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:06,169
We are also meeting another viewer.

333
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,602
We are going to their home

334
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,226
and the kids are gonna play

335
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:11,510
and we'll tell you the whole
story about that tomorrow,

336
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,524
and I'm looking forward to that.

337
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:16,017
And I just, I've been sitting here,

338
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:16,938
I've been reading a book,

339
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,378
I've been getting ready for bed

340
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:22,258
and I'm truly happy with what we film.

341
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:25,086
And Jared and I only share and post

342
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,662
what we want to share

343
00:11:26,662 --> 00:11:29,950
and a lot of it is maybe
the kids just playing

344
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:32,367
and in 10 years, in 20 years,

345
00:11:33,263 --> 00:11:35,597
this is for me to look back.

346
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,505
And I love what we are doing

347
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:41,129
and I have seen, not
tons, but a few people

348
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:43,281
saying that they don't like
how we've been filming lately

349
00:11:43,281 --> 00:11:45,384
or it's boring and I just want you to know

350
00:11:45,384 --> 00:11:47,641
that first and foremost we are doing this

351
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,301
for ourselves and for
our kids to look back on.

352
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,617
And I personally have changed
up how I've been filming

353
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:55,848
the last few weeks, and
I have really enjoyed it.

354
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:58,120
Instead of filming lots of little clips

355
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,769
throughout the day and trying to show

356
00:11:59,769 --> 00:12:00,844
what we're doing all day long,

357
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:04,266
I've been trying to focus
on just like two things

358
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,185
and making stories out of that,

359
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,005
like in the morning when I was cooking

360
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:09,061
all day the other day,

361
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,795
I was in the mood, and I wanted to show

362
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:11,628
you guys what I was doing,

363
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:15,258
so that turned out to be most of the vlog.

364
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:18,510
And so I've been trying
not to film so much

365
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,693
throughout the day and just focusing on

366
00:12:20,693 --> 00:12:23,078
a few things to film.

367
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:24,854
So I've been happy with that

368
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:28,824
and I have felt much
more at peace doing that.

369
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:31,906
My brain and focusing on the kids

370
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:33,764
and focusing on filming,

371
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:36,524
and I've just been trying to capture

372
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:38,532
what I really want to capture,

373
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,860
rather than feeling the need to film

374
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,100
more of my day and I really love that.

375
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,200
So I know not a ton of
people have loved it,

376
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,415
but I also know that
there's a lot of people

377
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:49,726
who have been supportive,

378
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:51,914
but I'm just letting you
know at the end of the day,

379
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:55,081
I'm filming for myself to look back on

380
00:12:56,165 --> 00:12:58,970
and I really have loved
what I've had to share

381
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,744
and thank you guys so
much for being supportive

382
00:13:01,744 --> 00:13:04,048
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

383
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:04,881
Bye.

384
00:13:04,881 --> 00:00:00,000
Go eat a donut.
