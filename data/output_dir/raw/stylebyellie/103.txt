1
00:00:00,253 --> 00:00:01,529
- Do you guys remember last night

2
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:03,005
when I was like, I'm
gonna help Jared edit,

3
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:04,614
while he gets some work done.

4
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:06,054
(laughs)

5
00:00:06,054 --> 00:00:07,358
I did help edit.

6
00:00:07,358 --> 00:00:09,461
We went to bed at two o'clock.

7
00:00:09,461 --> 00:00:11,981
But I got hardly the vlog edited,

8
00:00:11,981 --> 00:00:14,890
probably like five minutes worth.

9
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,473
So Jared is finishing the vlog.

10
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:19,875
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:20,708
Woo hoo

12
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:26,755
Oh my gosh.

13
00:00:27,996 --> 00:00:29,245
So that's what we're doing,

14
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:31,852
finishing the vlog, eating breakfast.

15
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:32,685
Gotta get ready.

16
00:00:32,685 --> 00:00:33,612
- We are back from church

17
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:36,717
and today at church was the very first day

18
00:00:36,717 --> 00:00:38,781
that I have, we call them callings,

19
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:42,914
it was like my new job
I guess you would say.

20
00:00:42,914 --> 00:00:44,857
It's volunteer work.

21
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:46,774
I teach the kids music,

22
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:52,144
like the kids from four years old

23
00:00:52,144 --> 00:00:53,345
to 12 years old.

24
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,768
I teach them music.

25
00:00:54,768 --> 00:00:56,297
I lead the music and everything.

26
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,610
And I was nervous to
get up in front of them.

27
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,729
I had a little bit of butterflies

28
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,072
until we actually got going,

29
00:01:01,072 --> 00:01:01,940
but then it was so much fun.

30
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,617
We laughed, we had fun

31
00:01:03,617 --> 00:01:05,473
and we sang some fun songs.

32
00:01:05,473 --> 00:01:06,713
What do you think about me
being the music teacher?

33
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:07,890
- I think it's so fun.

34
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,913
I think you're perfect.

35
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:11,514
And when Jackson goes
into class in one month--

36
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:13,386
- I know, I am so excited

37
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:15,449
that Jackson is gonna be in my class.

38
00:01:15,449 --> 00:01:17,569
And I also do some,

39
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,228
some of the time, I'll do
what we call the nursery,

40
00:01:20,228 --> 00:01:22,810
the kids who are 18
months to three years old.

41
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:24,162
I'll do some music with them too.

42
00:01:24,162 --> 00:01:25,857
So it's just a lot of fun

43
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:27,001
and I'm really excited,

44
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:29,041
but church is over.

45
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,712
We're not talking about church anymore,

46
00:01:30,712 --> 00:01:31,728
at least for the next little bit,

47
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:33,726
because we have a very special visitor

48
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:34,676
coming to our house
- We're done with church.

49
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:35,619
- We're done with church.

50
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:36,452
- We're done with church,

51
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:37,890
at least until next Sunday.

52
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,723
- [Ellie] No.

53
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,165
- No I'm totally kidding, that's a joke.

54
00:01:40,165 --> 00:01:41,773
We have a very special guest coming over

55
00:01:41,773 --> 00:01:44,628
to our house, and he's our friend,

56
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:47,605
but also, he's very
special to us right now,

57
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:50,855
because he's helping
us with this IVF grant,

58
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:51,922
- [Ellie] Which he did last year.

59
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:52,755
- which he did last year too.

60
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:56,688
- He was like one of the first people.

61
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:57,656
I guess they all were,

62
00:01:57,656 --> 00:01:58,489
I don't know who was the first,

63
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:01,308
but I just remember him
just being very nice.

64
00:02:01,308 --> 00:02:02,444
- Yes, very nice.

65
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,374
- [Ellie] Generous.

66
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,556
- Zack, we'll see ya just in a little bit.

67
00:02:05,556 --> 00:02:08,428
- You want to see my dance show?

68
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,817
- [Jared] Of course I do,
show me your dance show.

69
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:12,678
- No you have to sit on the couch.

70
00:02:12,678 --> 00:02:13,543
- Oh okay, you're right.

71
00:02:13,543 --> 00:02:15,248
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

72
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,041
may I introduce to you tonight

73
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:21,208
for the very first time on the
main stage, Jackson Mecham.

74
00:02:22,573 --> 00:02:23,632
Hit the highest music.

75
00:02:23,632 --> 00:02:26,215
(bright music)

76
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:31,004
Woo yeah.

77
00:02:32,874 --> 00:02:34,218
(music ends)

78
00:02:34,218 --> 00:02:36,801
(bright music)

79
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:50,362
Yay, clap your hands everyone.

80
00:02:50,362 --> 00:02:51,195
(claps)

81
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,778
Yay, good job boys.

82
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:54,973
Now take a bow.

83
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:58,196
(Jared laughs)

84
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:00,282
I hope you guys enjoyed
tonight's entertainment.

85
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:04,066
That was the Nutcracker
- It made me laugh.

86
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:06,305
- [Jared] by Jackson and
Calvin, or something like that,

87
00:03:06,305 --> 00:03:09,722
Dance of the Sugar, the Sugar Kiss Fairy.

88
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,447
- You guys never had
cherry cordial before?

89
00:03:13,447 --> 00:03:14,648
What are these called?

90
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,481
- [Ellie] I don't know if you would

91
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:16,314
appreciate them that much.

92
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:17,958
- Yeah, much too good for children.

93
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:18,957
- Are you trying one of these?
- They are the best.

94
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,295
- Much too good for children.

95
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:21,857
- One of these?

96
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:26,066
- Chew it, see what you think.
- Take a bite.

97
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:27,693
- [Ellie] Is it good?
(Jared laughing)

98
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:28,884
- Is it good?
- That's awesome.

99
00:03:28,884 --> 00:03:29,717
- [Ellie] Oh good.

100
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,781
Okay try it Cal.

101
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,022
(laughing)

102
00:03:34,022 --> 00:03:34,855
Do you like it?

103
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:35,688
- Mmm-hmm.

104
00:03:35,688 --> 00:03:36,521
- So we just had dinner.

105
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,573
We had our very special
friend Zack come over.

106
00:03:38,573 --> 00:03:39,765
Hey bud, how's it going?

107
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:40,598
- Good.

108
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:41,431
- Good.

109
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,722
And we've just been talking about

110
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,647
everything under the sun,

111
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:46,862
YouTube, IVF grants and
all of that good stuff.

112
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:47,758
For those of you that don't know,

113
00:03:47,758 --> 00:03:50,453
this is Zack who is one of our donors

114
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:52,349
for one of the IVF grants this year.

115
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:53,758
So thank you for being so generous,

116
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:55,037
thank you for taking the time

117
00:03:55,037 --> 00:03:56,671
to come up here and have dinner with us.

118
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:57,737
We appreciate you.

119
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:58,570
- It's my pleasure.

120
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,254
Thank you for you guys for putting it on,

121
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,551
because it wouldn't be
possible without you guys.

122
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:03,829
- [Jared] That was just
a small part of this,

123
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,465
so thank you very much.

124
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:07,656
- Okay, should we kick him out now?

125
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,185
- Yeah, yeah we fed you.
(Jared laughing)

126
00:04:09,185 --> 00:04:10,018
You gave us candy, so we're good.

127
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:11,703
- We fed you, you gave us candy,

128
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:13,990
we vlogged you, now it's time to go.

129
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,903
It's like MTV Cribs, get out of here.

130
00:04:15,903 --> 00:04:16,736
I'm just kidding,

131
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:17,569
you can stay as long as you want.

132
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:19,152
We have a bedroom downstairs.

133
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,471
- So yeah.
- Okay, perfect.

134
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,884
- But he has a house, so.

135
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:22,718
- [Jared] Yeah, a home.

136
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:24,864
There it is, did you get it?

137
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,870
- Awww.
- Oh Calvin.

138
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,328
- [Ellie] I knew he
wouldn't appreciate it.

139
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:29,723
- [Jared] Oh no!

140
00:04:29,723 --> 00:04:30,987
(Jared yells)

141
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:31,820
- [Ellie] Calvin.

142
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,323
- [Jared] He finally
took a bite out of it.

143
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:35,575
Like I said, much too good for children.

144
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:37,215
- Much too good for children.

145
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:38,829
- You want me to explain
what the cherry cordial is?

146
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:39,745
Maybe you have people who don't know.

147
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:40,887
- [Jared] Maybe you don't know, tell us.

148
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:42,015
- Alright, so cherry cordial,

149
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:45,140
I've probably had like 60
of these already today,

150
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,395
but inside of these,

151
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:49,100
so it looks like a normal kiss,

152
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,928
but inside of it is like
this gooey cherry stuff.

153
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:55,549
Let me see if I can cut this open,

154
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:56,680
This is what I do on my channel.

155
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,513
- I was gonna say,
- So do it like that.

156
00:04:57,513 --> 00:04:58,490
- [Jared] you're just
right at home right now.

157
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,208
- So it's all this gooey,
cherry sugary stuff.

158
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:04,341
It is incredibly incredibly rich,

159
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,992
so like, not everyone likes it.

160
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:07,825
If you're the type of person

161
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:09,749
who can eat frosting
straight from the container,

162
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:11,574
you're gonna love it.
- See, see Dad?

163
00:05:11,574 --> 00:05:13,599
- So it's not like a normal kiss,

164
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,592
you would say this is
more like a French kiss?

165
00:05:16,592 --> 00:05:17,444
Is that what you would say?

166
00:05:17,444 --> 00:05:18,277
- Better.

167
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,595
Better than a French kiss.
- Better than a French kiss.

168
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:22,888
- See Dad, I did it like this.

169
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:24,380
- [Jared] Oh let's see.

170
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,749
Oh yeah, good job bud, you did it.

171
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:27,582
Does it taste good?

172
00:05:27,582 --> 00:05:28,824
Oh no, lick it.

173
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:29,967
Does it taste good?

174
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:30,887
- Bleeh.

175
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:32,303
(Jared laughing)

176
00:05:32,303 --> 00:05:33,976
- There's lots of good kisses,

177
00:05:33,976 --> 00:05:36,616
but my favorite are the candy cane ones,

178
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:39,236
because they have little
peppermint things on the inside,

179
00:05:39,236 --> 00:05:41,472
little candy cane bits
on the inside of them.

180
00:05:41,472 --> 00:05:43,769
And I just like to put 'em in my mouth

181
00:05:43,769 --> 00:05:45,318
and let 'em melt in my mouth.

182
00:05:45,318 --> 00:05:47,068
And oh it's the best.

183
00:05:48,378 --> 00:05:49,972
He wanted the lips.

184
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:53,160
- No wait, I got a cold sore, right here.

185
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,594
- [Jared] Aww.
(Jared laughing)

186
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:57,430
- I literally after dinner,
I was like, I feel it,

187
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,472
like what the heck Ellie, what's wrong?

188
00:06:00,472 --> 00:06:04,068
It happens when I'm pregnant,
hormones, everything.

189
00:06:04,068 --> 00:06:05,207
Stress I guess, I don't know.

190
00:06:05,207 --> 00:06:06,199
- [Jared] What is it?

191
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,032
- Cold sore.

192
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:08,030
(Jared gasps)
- I already said that.

193
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,196
So I put medicine on it.

194
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:11,113
Anyway, I am so proud--

195
00:06:13,174 --> 00:06:14,734
I am so proud of our boys.

196
00:06:14,734 --> 00:06:17,548
At the same time, different bathrooms,

197
00:06:17,548 --> 00:06:19,460
they both had to go potty

198
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,702
and they both went.
- And they did.

199
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:23,413
- And I was like, this
is my life right now.

200
00:06:23,413 --> 00:06:25,037
Mom life, happy.
- I know.

201
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:27,303
- Right, and in a minute,

202
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,954
we won't need diapers for about

203
00:06:29,954 --> 00:06:30,787
- [Ellie] Six more months.

204
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:32,433
- A couple months

205
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,266
and then we'll have to get

206
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:35,078
all different kinds of diapers.

207
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:37,598
But this is like a huge
parenting success okay?

208
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:39,469
You'll understand when you get there.

209
00:06:39,469 --> 00:06:41,269
When both of your boys are using the potty

210
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,525
at the same time, it's
pretty incredible, okay?

211
00:06:44,525 --> 00:06:46,685
Parents give me a thumbs
up for that right?

212
00:06:46,685 --> 00:06:48,199
Give me a little high five.

213
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,566
You know, it was a lot of fun

214
00:06:49,566 --> 00:06:51,902
having Zack come over to our house.

215
00:06:51,902 --> 00:06:54,246
We've known Zack for what, two years now?

216
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:56,013
Is that about right, you think?

217
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,430
- I think so, I met him at the gym.

218
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,896
- Yeah and that was actually the story

219
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,032
that I was gonna tell.

220
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:02,115
It's so funny how we met.

221
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:05,380
The reason we met is because

222
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,506
Zack's sister actually watches our videos.

223
00:07:07,506 --> 00:07:09,173
So hi Zack's sister.

224
00:07:10,058 --> 00:07:12,475
And she had mentioned to Zack

225
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,266
that she saw his truck

226
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:17,946
in one of our videos,

227
00:07:17,946 --> 00:07:20,346
when Ellie and Bonnie were at the gym.

228
00:07:20,346 --> 00:07:23,026
And so she told Zack to go say hello

229
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,377
to Ellie and Bonnie at the gym.

230
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:29,547
And sure enough, this
muscular attractive guy

231
00:07:29,547 --> 00:07:31,787
comes up to Ellie and Bonnie--

232
00:07:31,787 --> 00:07:33,039
- He's like hey can I
get a picture of you,

233
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,456
I was like, sure.

234
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:37,524
- Of course.

235
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:40,247
And he's like oh I have
a YouTube channel too.

236
00:07:40,247 --> 00:07:41,178
And the rest is history.

237
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:42,011
You know,
- So fun.

238
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:43,170
- we worked on some project together.

239
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,401
We filmed a lot of videos together

240
00:07:45,401 --> 00:07:47,073
and Zack's a really great friend of ours

241
00:07:47,073 --> 00:07:47,906
and we're so grateful

242
00:07:47,906 --> 00:07:50,355
that he is part of the IVF grant again.

243
00:07:50,355 --> 00:07:53,252
So thank you Zack for being our friend

244
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:55,775
and for being so generous to do this.

245
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,774
- You know what's funny is

246
00:07:57,774 --> 00:07:59,367
I have my friends that I grew up with,

247
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:02,448
Jared has his, we both hung out with them,

248
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:07,239
but our married friends
have all come from YouTube.

249
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,127
- It's true.

250
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:10,086
- Like seriously, Carl and Jinger,

251
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:13,019
Missy, Cullen and Katie,
- and Bryan, Cullen and Katie.

252
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:14,843
- Like, just the people we hang with,

253
00:08:14,843 --> 00:08:17,334
it's like oh yeah, we met you online.

254
00:08:17,334 --> 00:08:19,542
- We met all our friends on the internet,

255
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:22,975
and that's okay to say in 2016, 2017.

256
00:08:22,975 --> 00:08:24,417
And you know it's almost 2018.

257
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,834
But in 2006, stranger danger,

258
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,068
something like that, I don't know.

259
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:31,052
What was the saying?

260
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,025
- When I was still in high school,

261
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,187
that would have been dangerous.

262
00:08:34,188 --> 00:08:35,020
- What's the saying,

263
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,520
2006, don't talk to strangers,

264
00:08:38,493 --> 00:08:40,417
don't get candy from strangers,

265
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,479
don't talk online with strangers,

266
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,230
don't get in cars with strangers.

267
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:47,615
2017, I went online to
talk with a stranger,

268
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,909
to have them pick me up in their car,

269
00:08:49,909 --> 00:08:52,520
from a stranger, to go
somewhere, something like that.

270
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,215
It's crazy how the world changes.

271
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:56,753
And that's where we are right now.

272
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,439
Ellie and I, one laptop,

273
00:08:58,439 --> 00:09:02,071
two laptops, we're gonna
work on Sunday night.

274
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,025
It is 10:30 and we're about to go to work.

275
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:07,129
Are you ready for the second
shift at the Mecham household?

276
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,533
- Yes.

277
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,013
Don't think I'm like just ignoring you

278
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:10,846
and tweeting or whatever.

279
00:09:10,846 --> 00:09:11,679
- [Jeremy] No you're working right now.

280
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,820
- I'm literally, yeah,

281
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,940
I'm texting, but--

282
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,394
- It's an important text message.

283
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:18,227
Who?

284
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:19,364
- I'm texting Landon.

285
00:09:19,364 --> 00:09:20,197
- Landon?

286
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,400
My brother in law?
- Yeah.

287
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,233
(Ellie laughs)

288
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,585
- Hey Landon, how ya doin'?

289
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:25,267
We're talking to you on the text message

290
00:09:25,267 --> 00:09:26,507
right now, right now.

291
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:27,523
- I just don't want you
to think I'm being rude

292
00:09:27,523 --> 00:09:28,356
by ignoring you.

293
00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:29,714
- I don't think you're
rude right now at all.

294
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,617
We had another special
little visitor today.

295
00:09:31,617 --> 00:09:32,865
I'm not sure if you noticed,

296
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,773
but while Ellie and I were working,

297
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:39,525
we had a little guest
come out and visit us.

298
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,275
(Calvin snoring)

299
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,073
He's quite the snorer.

300
00:09:45,073 --> 00:09:48,081
I think he gets that from Ellie.

301
00:09:48,081 --> 00:09:49,280
Hey you.

302
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,809
I love you.
- Goodnight.

303
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:52,476
- Goodnight sweetie.

304
00:09:53,328 --> 00:09:56,727
I think we both pulled a Jared tonight.

305
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,455
I think we both fell asleep on the couch

306
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,470
just for a little bit

307
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,142
as we were working.

308
00:10:02,142 --> 00:10:03,846
We are zonked.

309
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:06,270
But we are ready for a brand new week.

310
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,862
Thank you guys for watching.

311
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:09,291
We are going to end it right here.

312
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,354
Have a wonderful day

313
00:10:10,354 --> 00:10:12,866
and we will see you tomorrow.

314
00:10:12,866 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
