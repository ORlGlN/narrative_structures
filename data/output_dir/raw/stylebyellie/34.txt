It's snowing.

Grrrr, I knew this was gonna happen.

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,440
I knew that we would get snow.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,550
Just as soon as things started to warm up,

13
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,630
we got snow.

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,480
And apparently, it's going to be snowing

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,313
the entire day.

16
00:00:30,313 --> 00:00:33,690
There's like a 50% chance
of snow all day long.

17
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:35,680
And what that means is that probably

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,860
throughout the rest of the week,

19
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,520
we'll probably have little
things of snow here or there.

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,722
And the thing that is the
worst part about that,

21
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:45,450
it's not even like okay
we're gonna get dumped on

22
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,320
or nothing, it's like I don't know,

23
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,510
it's either gonna be some,
it's not gonna be a lot,

24
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,940
but it'll just be there a little bit

25
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,060
the rest of the week, and
I'm done with the snow.

26
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,000

00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,190

gonna move to Arizona.

Uh-oh, you guys are all in handcuffs.

29
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,350

30
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,300

You're in trouble?

32
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:07,280
Well this is gonna teach you to behave.

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,953
- [Jared] Mom's in trouble?

34
00:01:08,953 --> 00:01:09,786
Uh-oh.

35
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:11,650
- This is to make you
stand by my side all day.

This is the best punishment
you'll ever receive.

- [Jared] No one wants to
stay next to Mom all day long.

- I actually don't know
what the heck I'm doing.

39
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,650
- [Jared] This is some sort of game

40
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,710
that you guys are playing.

41
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,400
I wanted to come down here
and complain about the snow.

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,730
- Oh brrr, it's fine.

43
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,860
- [Jared] Hey, did you
see that it was snowing?

44
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,170
- It is cold, but we'll just stay inside

45
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,894
for a few more then.
- Yeah.

46
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:30,854

47
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:32,740
I'm gonna have to plow the driveway.

48
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,940
And that's the fun part.

49
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,270
Do you guys want to ride
the four-wheeler with me

50
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,220
and plow the driveway later today?

51
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,053
- No.

Perfect, just like that.

57
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,720

or my secondary impressions

119
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,780
of these flowers are kind of sad.

127
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,980
but there's popcorn and
bananas all over in here.

128
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,430
- [Jared] Well it's a kitchen
and you know, there's food.

129
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,263
- Well I know,

130
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,023
but the kids forgot to
clean their kitchen.

131

get them on their chores.

148
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:22,109

152
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,780
Did you potty in the toilet?

153
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,710
Good job.

154
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,790

155
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,537

- He did it all by himself.

156
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:33,764
- Hey careful.

157
00:04:33,764 --> 00:04:35,127
- Go put it back.

158
00:04:35,127 --> 00:04:36,310
Look at him being so careful.

159
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,640

One major thing that I forgot to say

162

on the video was that,

163
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,970
when I listen to the HomePod,

164
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:50,230
it feels like I'm wearing headphones.

165
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,700
It sounds good enough that
I'm wearing headphones.

166

intricacies of the song.

174
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,080
and you moved Miss Penny.

175
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,780
But look at your little brown nose.

176
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,440
Penny, what were you in?

177
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,070
What did you get in?

178
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,750
Did you get in the fire pit?

179
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,843
Did you play in our leftover fire.

180
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:25,420
(Ellie laughs)

181
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,630
Jared, look at her nose.

182
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,790
- She is like a chimney sweep.

183
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,040
- [Ellie] Did you play, huh?

184
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,533
She's tired.

185
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:33,907
- [Jared] Yeah, she's been playing hard.

186
00:05:33,907 --> 00:05:34,760
She's been playin'.

187
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,660
- [Ellie] You're tired.

188
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,370
She moved to her little bed.

189
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,000
- She never sits on her bed, but look,

190
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,910
she's sitting there.

191
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,743
- [Ellie] Yeah.

192
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:42,576
- [Jared] She's finally
getting used to it.

193
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:44,200
- You like it, it's comfy.
- Yeah.

194
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,790
- [Ellie] Okay you got to bed, okay?

195
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,770
Then we're gonna look at family names.

196
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,603
- That's a great idea.

197
00:05:48,603 --> 00:05:49,930
- Two things of good news,

198
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:52,870
one, Calvin has not had
any accidents today,

199
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,991
woo hoo.
- Woo hoo!

200
00:05:53,991 --> 00:05:57,019
- And two, we are sitting down together

201
00:05:57,019 --> 00:06:01,000
looking at some family history.

202
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,490
We are just looking at family names

203
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,980
just to continue our search,
just to see if anything

204
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,860
else sparks an interest for baby Mecham.

205
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,950
Jackson just suggested that
if the baby is not Mason,

206
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,530
his name shall be Cody Shark Dee Dee.

207
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,310
So Cody Shark Dee Dee?

208
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:19,900
If you are not Mason, you
will be Cody Shark Dee Dee.

209
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,700
- I think that's a good strong name.

210
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,240
- Especially Shark, I like it.

211
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,900
So we are just gonna look at FamilySearch?

212
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,160
Is that what we're looking under?

213
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,550
- Yeah, so this has all
of my family history

214
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,463
as far as we've gone back.

215
00:06:30,463 --> 00:06:33,230
If you guys remember, we
did the whole DNA thing.

216
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,394
Ancestry DNA,
- Yeah.

217
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,070
- So this is all tied together,

218
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,420
has all of our family as far back

219
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,800
as far back as I can remember.

220
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,440
- But you have it in
there if a family member

221
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,179
has updated it, is that correct?

222
00:06:44,179 --> 00:06:45,012
- Mmm-hmm.

223
00:06:45,012 --> 00:06:45,845
- Like your mom, like Jared's mom

224
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,369
is very big into family
history and genealogy.

225
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,469
And so she goes online at FamilySearch.org

226
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:52,550
and does all this stuff.

227
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,290
- So we're gonna see if
we can find any names

228
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,140
that just kind of like, oh yeah or no or--

229
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,210
- Can other people see
other peoples' stuff?

230
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,930
- I'm not sure how far
you can look into it.

231
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,030
- 'Cause that's kinda weird.

232
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,880
- Yeah, I'm not sure.

233
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,550
- Betty, ah that's cute.

234
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,940
- Betty Lou Cole.

235
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,220
- That's cute, not a girl though.

236
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,923
- Well that's my grandma,
but we're not having a girl.

237
00:07:10,923 --> 00:07:11,756
- That's cute, that's what I meant.

238
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:12,680
- Should we look on my mom's side

239
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,513
or my dad's side?

240
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:15,330
- Let's look on all of our sides.

241
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,180
- All of the sides.

242
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,900
- [Ellie] Got it, Leonidas.

243
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,770
- [Jared] Look, his son's
name was Leonidas too.

244
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,610
Americus, wow.

245
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,220
That was so funny.

246
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:28,010
Okay so, Joseph, William,
Johann, Gottlieb,

247
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,843
John Bahls.

248
00:07:28,843 --> 00:07:30,940
(laughing)

249
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,773
- Jackson's laughing.

250
00:07:31,773 --> 00:07:32,830
- Mary Bahls?

251
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,830
Hey it's my family,

252
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,650
I can make fun of them, right?
- Calvin,

253
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,380
- Okay so far we're really
not seeing anything.

254
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,400
- Elvira?

255
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,420
- Charles if probably my
favorite that I've seen on here.

256
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,890
But still, nothing beats--

257
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,100
- Nothing's really just
jumping out at us right now.

258
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,370
- It's just weird, because
Mason is the very first thing

259
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:51,000
that I even looked at and said

260
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,610
and then it's just clicked since.

261
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,098
We've talked, we've been very open,

262
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,520
we love the name Mason,

263
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,740
that's probably what his name will be,

264
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,710
we just want to really
make sure, you know?

265
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,590
Is that okay to say?

266
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,050
- I think that's okay to say,

267
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,101
but it may not be true.

268
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:03,934
(laughs)

269
00:08:03,934 --> 00:08:04,970
- It is true.

270
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,010
- We'll see.

271
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:06,843
- Let's keep looking.

272
00:08:06,843 --> 00:08:08,330
What's the first name you liked?

273
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,650
- [Jared] Cody what?

274
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,500
- Cody Shark Dee Dee.

275
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,730
- [Jared] Cody Shark Dee Dee.

276
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,540
- [Ellie] I don't know.

277
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,769
- Okay, here's the thing,
if this video gets 25,000--

278
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:18,669
- [Ellie] Oh boo, no we're not!

279
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:20,508
- We will name our baby
Cody Shark Dee Dee.

280
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:21,341
(laughing)

281
00:08:21,341 --> 00:08:24,210
- I am not that type of vlogger, no no no.

282
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,640
- Oh my gosh, that was be so bad,

283
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,090
but seriously if you do it, we will.

284
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,547
- No we won't, no we won't.

285
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:29,380
(laughing)

286
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,900
- My dad's family history, my dad's line

287
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,640
goes all the way back to 1448.

288
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,750
We know their names.

289
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,020
- [Ellie] John Meacham
at the time was the name.

290
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,130
- Yeah, M-E-A-C-H-A-M.

291
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,419
- [Ellie] That's crazy.

292
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,379
- Isn't that cool?

293
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,212
What year is it?

294
00:08:43,212 --> 00:08:46,490
Over 600 years, or, 600 years.

295
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,470
- Calvin?

296
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,500
Sorry Jackson.

297
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,980
You need to leave him alone

298
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,930
when he's in the bathroom.

299
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,360
- So my mom.

300
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,200
- [Calvin] My mom.

301
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,338
- Had her dad.

302
00:08:57,338 --> 00:08:58,171
- [Calvin] My dad.

303
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:02,939
- Had his mom had her mom--

304
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:03,772
- [Calvin] Her mom, my mom.

305
00:09:03,772 --> 00:09:06,390
- Had her mom, had her dad,

306
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,820
had her dad,
- My Dad.

307
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,270
- Had her mom, had her dad,

308
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,980
had her dad, had her dad,

309
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,880
had her mom mom's sister,

310
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,250
had her son,
- My mom.

311
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,330
had his son, had his son,

312
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,030
had his son, had his son,
- My son.

313
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,240
had his daughter, had his son,

314
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,779
who had a kid named Mason.

315
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:26,803
- What?

316
00:09:26,803 --> 00:09:29,053
(laughing)

317
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,657
Jared!

318
00:09:33,657 --> 00:09:34,940
- I found a link.

319
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,129
(laughing)

320
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,319
Look at this.

321
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,152
Look at this.

322
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:42,860
Okay, so here's me,
generation one two three

323
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,570
four five six seven eight nine,

324
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:49,330
10, 11, 12 back, over one,

325
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:53,551
one two three four five six seven eight.

326
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,720
(laughing)

327
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,185
So that's okay, that's
fourth cousin once removed?

328
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:00,018
- When we were sitting down,

329
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:02,460
Jared's like well i guess if
we have a Mason in the family,

330
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,010
it'll just reaffirm
that it is to be Mason.

331
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,090
That's hilarious.

332
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,780
- Let us be clear real quick

333
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,180
This is not official.

334
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,320
This is not official.

335
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,423
You have to agree with me on this.

336
00:10:11,423 --> 00:10:12,710
This is not official.

337
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,500
We don't know for sure yet.

338
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,390
- I would say 99%.

339
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,356
- Okay there's still a chance

340
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:18,510
it might change.
- Yes,

341
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,750
- Absolutely, and we're
both on the same page.

342
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,282
We're doing this, but that's hilarious.

343
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,532
(playful guitar music)

344
00:10:47,568 --> 00:10:49,970
The menu tonight is taco salads

345
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,370
and the menu tomorrow,

346
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,742
we're gonna do homemade
Chinese food Jared.

347
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:53,575
- [Jared] Ooh yeah.

348
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,408
- We're gonna try.

349
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:55,241
We have a list of baby names

350
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:56,980
that we have officially have written down

351
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,850
that we're gonna continue to look through.

352
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,160
Mason's at the top of the list.

353
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,630
I think a lot of the others

354
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,510
would go really smooth as middle names.

355
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,668
It's getting really fun.

356
00:11:04,668 --> 00:11:05,501
- [Jared] Yeah.

357
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:07,960
- And I liked going through
all of our family names,

358
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,420
because it reassured
how I'm already feeling.

359
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,240
- So a lot of these names
aren't surprises to you.

360
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,320
We've talked about these before,

361
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,740
but I kinda feel like
these are the top names,

362
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,090
especially this bottom one,

363
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,110
Cody Shark Dee Dee.

364
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,858
Like I said Jackson, 25,000.

365
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:24,941
- [Ellie] No.

366
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:26,999
- No.

367
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:28,140
- [Jared] Okay you're right.

368
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,160
- Do you like Cody?

369
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,806
Or do you like Mason?

370
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:31,650
- Cody!

371
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,200
Cody Shark Dee Dee.

372
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,583
- [Jared] See Ellie, he wants it too.

373
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,696
- [Ellie] What did you say?

374
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,970
- I'm liking it now.

375
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,160
- [Ellie] You like it now?

376
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,750
You're even eating lettuce, good job.

377
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,810
Mine definitely looks the best.

378
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,160
Everyone else's is very plain.

379
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,670
Just like you like it Jared.

380
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,350
- Very plain Jane, 'cause I stay sane,

381
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,970
if you know what I mean.

382
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,950
As our evening is coming to a wrap up,

383
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,060
we have a project that we're
going to be working on.

384
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,500
I know, another project for us,

385
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,450
this is insane, I don't
know what we're thinking.

386
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,430
So we are gonna go through
all of our hard drives.

387
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,791
We're going to go through
all of our computers

388
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:06,100
and we're going to
compile all of the photos

389
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,750
that we've taken over the past,

390
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,820
I don't know, 10 years or so?

391
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,870
- This is crazy.

392
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,656
- Like 15 or 20,000 pictures.

393
00:12:13,656 --> 00:12:15,620
- We have to do it now though,

394
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,720
like I told Jared, I'm like I want a book,

395
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,040
a baby Jackson book, baby Calvin book,

396
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,200
toddler books, a Penny book,

397
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,790
the house building process book,

398
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,355
I want those organized

399
00:12:25,355 --> 00:12:27,220
and I'm just like I need to do it while,

400
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,502
one, we have energy,

401
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:31,680
the kids are happy right
now, we should start.

402
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,010
So we're starting the process.

403
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,360
- Right now we're actually updating

404
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,910
both of our laptop computers
to a new operating system,

405
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,540
so we can download an
app to help us do this.

406
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,600
I figure this is gonna
take us a long time,

407
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,610
so Ellie I brought this for you,

408
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,510
so you can use it,
- Thanks.

409
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,803
- [Jared] While you go through--

410
00:12:45,803 --> 00:12:47,370
- Chocolate and a massage, yes, thanks.

411
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,270
- Thousands and thousands
and thousands of photos.

412
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,330
So we're gonna print some of the pictures,

413
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,090
because we're gonna probably use chapbooks

414
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:54,950
for some of the pictures,

415
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,080
but a lot of them we're
actually going to be printing

416
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,806
actual pictures for an actual photo album,

417
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:02,720
where you put 'em in the slides.

418
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,940
- I had tweeted it and
I had a few people ask,

419
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,930
I'd love to do that, what's the process?

420
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,100
So I thought maybe if Jared explained

421
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,620
the process, because we're overwhelmed,

422
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,850
but if you explain it,

423
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,350
maybe that might help some
people that ask questions.

424
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,620
- Phew, here goes.

425
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,210
So there's a couple
different things that I use

426
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,750
and it would probably be
better to explain this

427
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,583
in front of a computer.

428
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:23,080
But for time's sake, I'm
just going to do it verbally.

429
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,930
We import all of the pictures that we take

430
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,210
with our camera, this camera right here

431
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:28,043
with our vlog,

432
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:31,420
our phone cameras and any other devices.

433
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,700
The computer recognizes that and uses it

434
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,790
to import it into the
photos app on our Macs.

435
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,870
We have a few different libraries

436
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,040
from all of the different
computers that we've had

437
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,400
and we're using an application
called Power Photos

438
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,050
that allows us to merge the libraries,

439
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,860
and see if there's any duplicates.

440
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,210
And take care of those.

441
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,530
Once we have all of that done,

442
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,680
and we're in one single library,

443
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,970
Ellie is going to take all of those photos

444
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,220
and organize them into the
photos that she mentioned.

445
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,330
Then, once that is done,
she is going to mark them

446
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,390
with priority, the highest
priority will probably

447
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,090
have actual physical photos printed

448
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,010
and we'll go from there.

449
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,320
So it's pretty easy when
you say it like that,

450
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,760
but it's going to take
a very very long time.

451
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,300
But I love Google Photos,

452
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,090
because it keeps free unlimited backup

453
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,340
of all of your photos.

454
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,950
So all of my photos on my phone

455
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,750
are automatically synced to Google Photos.

456
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,210
Whenever we plug in our phones,

457
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,780
it's automatically backed
up to the photos app,

458
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,930
so those are two quick easy ways

459
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,130
to back up and sync photos.

460
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,110
Phew, I hope that made sense.

461
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,020
Now that I've said that,

462
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,430
I want to ask you, what is
your photo organization?

463
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,270
With digital photos, we
can snap as much as we want

464
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,320
and we kind of do it willy nilly

465
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,520
and organization is
always the hardest part.

466
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,350
What do you guys do to
organize your photos?

467
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,807
- Another day, the kids are in bed

468
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,270
and the bath is going to be started.

469
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,590
When we went to Lush yesterday,

470
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't know if you guys
realized how big these are.

471
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,070
They said that they came out
with one during the holidays,

472
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,120
but it was just online.

473
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,930
Bath bomb is humongo, this is my face.

474
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,840
It's huge!

475
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,020
So I'm going to take a
big ole bath right now.

476
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,328
I'm trying to put it down
softly, so I don't break it.

477
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,161
I'm gonna take a bath.

478
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,910
We have thousands of photos uploading.

479
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,220
I can't wait to make
some books for my kids

480
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,930
and so that I have them forever.

481
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:19,520
Those are some of my
favorite items I have.

482
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,290
Jared made me a pregnancy book.

483
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,110
I have these books from when I was a kid.

484
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,840
We have tons of books downstairs.

485
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,230
Just of pictures,

486
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,960
but it's been 10 years since
we've organized photos.

487
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,400
Jared and I have never really organized

488
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,440
all of our photos.

489
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,950
It's a lot of photos to go through,

490
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,350
especially when you have two kids

491
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:38,670
and pregnancies that you--

492
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,010
and a dog that you have
taken pictures galore, so.

493
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,450
Organizing our life one day at a time,

494
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,240
so thank you guys for watching.

495
00:15:46,240 --> 00:00:00,000
And we'll see you tomorrow, bye.
