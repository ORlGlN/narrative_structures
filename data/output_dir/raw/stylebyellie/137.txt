1
00:00:00,043 --> 00:00:01,845
(lively music)

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:04,900
- Let's talk about the marshmallow test.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,395
In the 60s and 70s, there
was the Stanford experiment,

4
00:00:09,395 --> 00:00:12,812
where they would give kids a small reward

5
00:00:13,843 --> 00:00:16,484
and see if they would delay gratification

6
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,787
for something bigger.

7
00:00:17,787 --> 00:00:21,899
So in this situation, I'm
gonna give you one marshmallow,

8
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:26,251
but if you wait, I'll
give you two marshmallows.

9
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:28,499
I'm not sure how accurate the results

10
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:30,051
of this test are,

11
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,971
but I know my siblings have done this.

12
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:33,179
I'll have links to their videos

13
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:34,883
in the description down below,

14
00:00:34,883 --> 00:00:36,209
and we wanted to try Jackson

15
00:00:36,209 --> 00:00:39,261
and maybe even Calvin,
just to see what they did

16
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:40,997
in this specific test.

17
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:42,336
So we have a marshmallow set up,

18
00:00:42,336 --> 00:00:44,192
we're gonna bring Jackson in first,

19
00:00:44,192 --> 00:00:47,700
and we just thought it'd just
be fun to see what he does.

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,915
- What?

21
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:49,855
- Yeah, that's a marshmallow.

22
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:51,960
Go sit in that one right there.

23
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,120
So I have a marshmallow here on this plate

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,351
for you okay, you can have it.

25
00:00:57,351 --> 00:01:00,601
But, if you wait, and you don't eat it,

26
00:01:02,921 --> 00:01:05,319
I'll come back a little bit later,

27
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,226
and I'll give you something
extra special, okay?

28
00:01:08,226 --> 00:01:10,390
- Are you gonna come later?

29
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,319
- I'll come later, okay?

30
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,636
- Why I am gonna stay in here forever?

31
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:18,347
- Not forever, just
for a little bit, okay?

32
00:01:18,347 --> 00:01:20,011
You have one marshmallow right here,

33
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,756
but if you wait, and don't eat it,

34
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:24,747
I'll give you another one,

35
00:01:24,747 --> 00:01:26,700
something bigger, better, okay?

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,533
- Okay.

37
00:01:27,533 --> 00:01:28,483
- Okay, I'll be right back,

38
00:01:28,483 --> 00:01:29,316
I'll go get it.

39
00:01:29,316 --> 00:01:30,240
- Okay.

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,542
Is it another marshmallow?

41
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:34,467
- [Jared] Maybe, we'll see.

42
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:36,482
- Do do do do do do.

43
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:39,065
(bright music)

44
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:50,199
(sneezes)

45
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,032
I love it!

46
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:55,885
- So I have Jackson set up in
the filming room right now,

47
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:57,869
with the marshmallow test.

48
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:00,413
And it's been about a
minute and 30 seconds.

49
00:02:00,413 --> 00:02:01,246
He's just sitting there.

50
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,669
- [Ellie] Did he want
to eat the marshmallow?

51
00:02:02,669 --> 00:02:04,105
- [Jared] He went for it at first, yeah.

52
00:02:04,105 --> 00:02:05,005
- And you said if you wait.

53
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:05,838
- [Jared] And I said if you wait,

54
00:02:05,838 --> 00:02:09,255
you can have something bigger and better.

55
00:02:13,693 --> 00:02:15,379
- [Ellie] And it's for five minutes, huh?

56
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,836
- [Jared] Yeah, something like that.

57
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:17,669
- [Ellie] Okay.

58
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,961
- [Jared] He's doing so
good, I'm really impressed.

59
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,294
I thought he would demolish it.

60
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:24,008
(laughing)

61
00:02:24,008 --> 00:02:25,198
- [Ellie] He's just like gonna take a nap.

62
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:26,615
- [Jared] I know.

63
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,543
I'm mostly surprised he's
just sitting in the chair.

64
00:02:31,543 --> 00:02:32,943
- [Ellie] It's like he
doesn't want to look at it,

65
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:34,034
'cause he knows it'll tempt him.

66
00:02:34,034 --> 00:02:35,700
- [Jared] I know.

67
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,033
- [Ellie] Hey, you're smart.

68
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,462
(bright music)

69
00:02:51,286 --> 00:02:52,119
- Ha!

70
00:02:54,544 --> 00:02:56,414
- [Ellie] Did he said just say Dad?

71
00:02:56,414 --> 00:02:57,951
- Dad!

72
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:58,983
- [Jared] Yeah.

73
00:02:58,983 --> 00:03:01,152
- [Ellie] How many more
minutes does he have?

74
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,154
- [Jared] He's got like two more minutes.

75
00:03:02,154 --> 00:03:02,987
- Awww.

76
00:03:02,987 --> 00:03:06,944
I feel like we all need
to give kids more credit,

77
00:03:06,944 --> 00:03:08,624
because they're just kids.

78
00:03:08,624 --> 00:03:10,610
- Yeah, I mean he's not
even four years old.

79
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,710
- Even if he had ate it,

80
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,984
it's like well I would've done that too.

81
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:15,801
- Well I think at some point,

82
00:03:15,801 --> 00:03:18,179
I'm not reading into any of these results

83
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,756
from this too much,

84
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,575
but I feel like well, I'm
just gonna eat it now,

85
00:03:21,575 --> 00:03:23,198
because I don't want two, you know?

86
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:25,039
Because what about that outcome?

87
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,227
So either way
- Because you don't want to?

88
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:28,123
- You don't want two of them,

89
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,760
you're just like, well
I'm gonna be one and done

90
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,210
and just get out of here.

91
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,441
I don't know,

92
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,740
maybe that tells more about me than

93
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,180
- Our three year old?

94
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,412
- He's doing so good.

95
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:39,418
- He's closing his eyes.

96
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:41,082
- Mmm, what a good kid.

97
00:03:41,082 --> 00:03:41,917
- Dad.

98
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:43,446
- Dad Dad.

99
00:03:43,446 --> 00:03:46,029
(bright music)

100
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:52,587
Okay, let's see what he does, he's moving.

101
00:03:52,587 --> 00:03:53,420
- Oh.

102
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,281
(laughs)

103
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:56,531
- He's laying on the chair.

104
00:03:58,456 --> 00:04:01,623
(humming and revving)

105
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:04,402
He's being a race car.

106
00:04:06,004 --> 00:04:08,295
- [Jackson] My favorite vroom vroom.

107
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:10,015
Vroom vroom vroom!

108
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:12,598
(yell revving)

109
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,755
- So are you supposed to tell him

110
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,588
he'll get bigger and better

111
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:17,456
or are you supposed to
tell him hell get two?

112
00:04:17,456 --> 00:04:18,911
- It's just a bigger reward.

113
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,340
Most people do two marshmallows,

114
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,822
but the whole point of it is something

115
00:04:21,822 --> 00:04:24,901
that's better than the first one.

116
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:28,373
- Well you know what we could give him.

117
00:04:28,373 --> 00:04:30,015
- Sure, yeah, that'll work.

118
00:04:30,015 --> 00:04:32,977
- We've had this in our cupboard forever.

119
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:34,907
- A little Pup Patrol sucker.

120
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,824
Pup Patrol, Pup Patrol.

121
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,602
(bright music)

122
00:04:48,597 --> 00:04:49,430
- Dad!

123
00:04:50,788 --> 00:04:53,371
- He touched it, he touched it.

124
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,163
- Dad?

125
00:04:57,194 --> 00:04:58,027
Dad?

126
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,978
- Okay that's 5:32,
I'm gonna go back down.

127
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:06,674
Okay, Jackson, how was that?

128
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:09,431
Was that fun or was that boring?

129
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:10,264
- Boring.

130
00:05:10,264 --> 00:05:11,831
- It was boring, but guess what?

131
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:12,664
- What?

132
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:14,115
- You didn't eat this marshmallow,

133
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,995
you know what that means?

134
00:05:15,995 --> 00:05:18,245
You get another marshmallow

135
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:20,825
and just because I think
you're the coolest kid

136
00:05:20,825 --> 00:05:23,476
in the world, Pup Patrol.

137
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:25,169
A little Pup Patrol sucker.

138
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:26,781
- This is cool.

139
00:05:26,781 --> 00:05:27,614
- Yeah.

140
00:05:27,614 --> 00:05:28,447
Okay now that you've done this,

141
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,725
I have some questions for you, okay?

142
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:31,558
- Okay.

143
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:34,888
- Was this hard or was it easy?

144
00:05:34,888 --> 00:05:35,721
- Hard.

145
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,554
- It was hard, huh?

146
00:05:36,554 --> 00:05:38,842
Why didn't you eat the marshmallow?

147
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:40,473
- Because I didn't.

148
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,306
- You didn't.

149
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:44,906
Is it because you wanted
to get something bigger?

150
00:05:44,906 --> 00:05:45,880
- Yeah.

151
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,609
- Yeah, and so you knew that by waiting,

152
00:05:47,609 --> 00:05:49,216
you'd get something bigger, huh.

153
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,049
- Yeah.

154
00:05:50,049 --> 00:05:52,673
- Do you feel like you got
something better, for waiting?

155
00:05:52,673 --> 00:05:53,506
- Mmm-mmm.

156
00:05:53,506 --> 00:05:55,979
- Yeah, these are pretty cool, huh?

157
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,072
(laughing)

158
00:05:58,072 --> 00:06:01,367
Calvin, don't worry, we'll do
this with you very very soon.

159
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:04,701
So why did you wait and you
didn't eat this one, why?

160
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:06,310
- Because I didn't.

161
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,511
- Because you knew
you'd get more than one?

162
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:09,344
- Yeah.

163
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:11,160
- Yeah.

164
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,349
Did you like waiting or was it hard?

165
00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:14,182
- It was hard.

166
00:06:14,182 --> 00:06:15,015
- It was hard?

167
00:06:15,015 --> 00:06:15,848
- Yeah.

168
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:16,911
- But you did really good, huh?

169
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:17,744
- It was hard waiting.

170
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:18,857
- Yeah, it was.

171
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:20,832
But you did awesome at it, huh?

172
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,292
You were a good boy.

173
00:06:22,292 --> 00:06:23,125
- Good job.
- Pssht.

174
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,633
- Should we
- Ba la la la la.

175
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,883
- Oh let's try it again.

176
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:28,083
- Ba la la la.
- Ba la la la.

177
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:29,799
(laughs)

178
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:31,107
- Chase is gonna do it.

179
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,127
- Okay, let's see.

180
00:06:32,127 --> 00:06:32,960
- Ba la la la.

181
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,593
- Ba la la la.

182
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:37,293
- [Both] Dun dun dun dun.

183
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:40,351
- Do you think we should
try this with Calvin?

184
00:06:40,351 --> 00:06:43,165
Do you think Calvin will wait?

185
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,221
Do you think he will?

186
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,054
- Yeah.

187
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:46,648
- Do you think Calvin
will eat the marshmallow

188
00:06:46,648 --> 00:06:49,398
or do you think he'll
wait for two marshmallows?

189
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:50,752
- Maybe he will eat it.

190
00:06:50,752 --> 00:06:52,754
- He might, yeah, well should we see?

191
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:54,167
Let's go ask Calvin to come down here

192
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:55,119
and we'll try it with him.

193
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,657
Let's go take our marshmallows upstairs.

194
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:57,490
Okay, come on.
- No no.

195
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,362
- Let's go.

196
00:06:58,362 --> 00:06:59,445
- Okay, fine.

197
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:04,398
- Okay, can you say hi?

198
00:07:04,398 --> 00:07:05,902
- Hi.

199
00:07:05,902 --> 00:07:06,968
- Calvin's gonna do it now.

200
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,804
- Hi Calvin, welcome to
the marshmallow test.

201
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:10,637
So here's the deal guys,

202
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,555
I have no expectations
for Calvin whatsoever,

203
00:07:13,555 --> 00:07:16,616
because he's a little young for this test,

204
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:17,952
at least the way that I think.

205
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:19,095
But we're gonna try it out

206
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:19,945
just for kicks and giggles,

207
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,506
just to see what happens.

208
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:24,787
Calvin is two, he'll be three in May.

209
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:26,704
So Calvin, here's the deal.

210
00:07:26,704 --> 00:07:29,068
I have one marshmallow.

211
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:31,569
And you want it really really bad.

212
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:32,536
But here's the thing,

213
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,673
I can give you one marshmallow

214
00:07:34,673 --> 00:07:36,738
and you can have this
marshmallow, if you want,

215
00:07:36,738 --> 00:07:39,905
but, if you wait and you don't eat it,

216
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:42,850
I'll go upstairs,

217
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,464
and I'll get you two marshmallows.

218
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,297
- Yeah.

219
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:48,083
- Okay do you want two marshmallows?

220
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:51,056
Yeah, don't eat it and I'll give you two.

221
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:52,166
So I'll be right back,.

222
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,694
And if you wait, I'll bring you two.

223
00:07:54,694 --> 00:07:55,527
Okay?

224
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:56,360
- Mmm-mmm.

225
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,193
- Okay, I love you.

226
00:07:57,193 --> 00:07:58,421
Give me a kiss.

227
00:07:58,421 --> 00:08:01,581
Okay, I'll be right back
with another one, okay?

228
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:04,164
(lively music)

229
00:08:14,732 --> 00:08:16,899
(blowing)

230
00:08:19,234 --> 00:08:24,096
Look at him, he's shaking
his arms and saying no.

231
00:08:24,096 --> 00:08:25,676
- Stay.

232
00:08:25,676 --> 00:08:26,509
Don't.

233
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:32,899
- [Jared] I think he's eating it now.

234
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:33,732
- [Ellie] Aww.

235
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:36,315
- [Jared] He shook his head no.

236
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:42,544
- [Ellie] Aww.

237
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:46,711
I think he's eating it yep.
- I can't tell if he's eating

238
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,272
- [Ellie] Yep yep, it's gone.

239
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:53,479
- [Jared] He's eating it.

240
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:54,852
- [Ellie] But at least he tried.

241
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:55,685
- Well did you see him,

242
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:58,008
he folded his arms and went

243
00:08:58,008 --> 00:09:00,841
- [Ellie] Aww, he did pretty good,

244
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:02,549
- Yeah.

245
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,563
- [Ellie] but didn't quite make it.

246
00:09:04,563 --> 00:09:06,146
- [Jackson] Calvin?

247
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,038
Calvin, why did you eat it?

248
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:10,871
- [Ellie] Hi Cal.

249
00:09:10,871 --> 00:09:12,411
- Hey bud.

250
00:09:12,411 --> 00:09:14,056
- [Ellie] Did you eat it?

251
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:14,959
Awww.

252
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,709
- Why did you eat it?

253
00:09:17,583 --> 00:09:19,472
How did you eat it Calvin?

254
00:09:19,472 --> 00:09:21,038
- He's shaking his head.

255
00:09:21,038 --> 00:09:22,794
- Took just a couple little bites.

256
00:09:22,794 --> 00:09:24,102
How cute is that?

257
00:09:24,102 --> 00:09:26,433
My favorite part was
when he folded his arms

258
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,616
and was like no.

259
00:09:27,616 --> 00:09:28,938
- But that was just a
little too hard to resist.

260
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,475
- Calvin do that again.

261
00:09:30,475 --> 00:09:32,645
- Yeah, it was a good marshmallow, huh?

262
00:09:32,645 --> 00:09:34,196
- Border Hound says say no.

263
00:09:34,196 --> 00:09:35,534
Do you want to see this?

264
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,388
(gasps)

265
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:38,145
Dun dun dun.

266
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:38,978
- Whoa.

267
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:40,880
- Well Calvin didn't quite make it.

268
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,056
But I think he's a little young,

269
00:09:43,056 --> 00:09:45,755
but it was cute to watch it anyway.

270
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,721
- We didn't really have
expectations for Calvin,

271
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,498
but Jackson I felt like he's old enough

272
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:50,331
to do this test.

273
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:51,164
- It's mine, it's mine.

274
00:09:51,164 --> 00:09:51,997
- Totally.

275
00:09:51,997 --> 00:09:52,830
- It's mine.

276
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,663
- Oh and now we're gonna
- Here Calvin, here's this.

277
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,541
- fight over the toy.

278
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,783
Calvin can finish the marshmallow.

279
00:09:55,783 --> 00:09:57,124
He didn't quite win a prize,

280
00:09:57,124 --> 00:09:59,418
but we're gonna totally gonna
do this again in the future,

281
00:09:59,418 --> 00:10:01,040
and I bet he will win a prize.

282
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,393
- So that is the marshmallow test.

283
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,124
I hope you guys enjoyed
just seeing the funny

284
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:06,627
reactions from the kids and what they did.

285
00:10:06,627 --> 00:10:08,125
- Dun dun dun dun.

286
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,397
- Dun dun dun dun.

287
00:10:09,397 --> 00:10:11,243
- If you enjoyed the video,

288
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:12,796
give it a big thumps up

289
00:10:12,796 --> 00:10:15,331
and we will see you
guys on our next video.

290
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,568
Thank you for watching.

291
00:10:16,568 --> 00:10:17,401
- Bye.
- Bye.

292
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,518
- Bye.
- Bye.

293
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,140
- We want all of our
friends to do this too.

294
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,916
I want to see Ollie, Gaines,

295
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,506
even Boston , I don't know
if Boston's done this.

296
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:26,508
- I think Boston did it a long time ago,

297
00:10:26,508 --> 00:10:28,324
so I think he's ready for round two.

298
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:30,388
- If you have a kid around three or four,

299
00:10:30,388 --> 00:10:32,240
even older that's perfect.

300
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,994
So try it and tag us in the video.

301
00:10:33,994 --> 00:10:35,663
- Okay, bye.
- I'm Spiderman.

302
00:10:35,663 --> 00:10:36,496
- Psshht.

303
00:10:36,496 --> 00:00:00,000
- Pssht, pssht pssht.
