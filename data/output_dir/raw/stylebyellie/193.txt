1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:01,227
(laughing)

2
00:00:01,227 --> 00:00:04,394
(twangy lively music)

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,828
- I've been walking like
this for 30 minutes,

4
00:00:10,828 --> 00:00:12,811
just trying to get across the kitchen.

5
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,171
I just need to go to the bathroom.

6
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,754
(bright music)

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,080
Good morning Calvin.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,968
Oh, are you trying to open that?

9
00:00:24,968 --> 00:00:26,562
You want some more?

10
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:28,148
(sweet music)

11
00:00:28,148 --> 00:00:29,596
Oh jeez, good morning Penny.

12
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:31,274
(Jared laughing)

13
00:00:31,274 --> 00:00:32,234
It's nice to see a tidal wave

14
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:33,510
of eruption of happiness and joy.

15
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,118
You look like a little bear
in that little robe of yours,

16
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:37,868
you know that Calvin?

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,193
Ooh, bear kisses and bear hugs.

18
00:00:42,193 --> 00:00:45,754
That's a great way to start the morning.

19
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:47,584
- [Ellie] I got me some bear kisses.

20
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:48,617
(yelling)

21
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:50,067
- [Man On TV] Push up.

22
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,232
- [Ellie] Look at you do it, bud.

23
00:00:52,232 --> 00:00:53,560
(Ellie laughing)

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,912
Okay, we're doing our work out.

25
00:00:54,912 --> 00:00:57,246
Calvin, are you gonna get
down there and work out?

26
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:58,738
- So our day is just beginning,

27
00:00:58,738 --> 00:01:00,390
but we've already done so much.

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,254
We did our work out.

29
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:02,520
I took Penny for a walk.

30
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,398
We're getting ready for the day

31
00:01:03,398 --> 00:01:05,086
and we've got a lot of stuff going on.

32
00:01:05,086 --> 00:01:07,158
And I already feel so great.

33
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,662
I just did one work out,

34
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:11,110
Ellie and I did and the
kids were there too,

35
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:11,943
it was really cute.

36
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:14,131
But, the biggest part of this

37
00:01:14,131 --> 00:01:16,380
is mental and physical changes,

38
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,338
something to make me feel
better in different ways

39
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:20,410
to make me happier too.

40
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,542
And it's already making that effect.

41
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,194
And I feel like doing things,

42
00:01:23,194 --> 00:01:24,798
like these little check ins.

43
00:01:24,798 --> 00:01:26,597
It's gonna be helpful for me

44
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:27,430
and maybe some of you guys

45
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,332
who are doing something similar.

46
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,524
So I'm already feeling great,

47
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:32,308
and it's time to tackle the day.

48
00:01:32,308 --> 00:01:33,141
- We are ready to go.

49
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:34,629
I've got the kids some snacks.

50
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,413
They just got their hair cut done.

51
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:40,180
Calvin sat so good while I did it,

52
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,572
just like that.

53
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:43,508
He was quiet and put his hands down

54
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:45,188
and didn't even make eye contact with me.

55
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,021
Boo!

56
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:48,314
Boo.

57
00:01:48,314 --> 00:01:49,286
(Ellie laughing)

58
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:52,230
He's a little mad, he wants his snack.

59
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,550
Okay, you fold your arms,

60
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,398
you be a little mad for a minute.

61
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:57,678
Jackson, let's see your hair.

62
00:01:57,678 --> 00:01:59,428
Wow, that looks good.

63
00:02:00,966 --> 00:02:02,063
So we got your hair cut done.

64
00:02:02,063 --> 00:02:03,854
We even cut Jare's hair.

65
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:04,693
It looks so good.

66
00:02:04,693 --> 00:02:05,731
Should we run errands?

67
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:08,148
Ready, set, go.
- Let's do it!

68
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,831
- [Ellie] That's what you wanted, huh?

69
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,624
You wanted a snack.

70
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:15,704
Come here.

71
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:17,892
- [Jackson] I want to take my bike.

72
00:02:17,892 --> 00:02:19,323
- [Ellie] You want to take your bike?

73
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:20,883
- Yeah, I want to take it.

74
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:21,755
- [Ellie] Ooh I don't know if the stores

75
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:23,423
will let us have a bike in there.

76
00:02:23,423 --> 00:02:25,839
- [Jared] Someone is
getting a little antsy.

77
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:27,184
The one thing that you wanted to do

78
00:02:27,184 --> 00:02:30,001
was bring your bike with us.

79
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,719
So we have been running errands,

80
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,287
and Jackson was like can we please

81
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,439
take my bike. please.

82
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:37,775
So we did just that.

83
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,137
Boom, baby, here's your bike.

84
00:02:39,137 --> 00:02:41,350
Now there's one rule okay?

85
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,924
You have to go slow and you
have to go next to us, okay?

86
00:02:43,924 --> 00:02:44,912
And we're gonna make sure you don't go out

87
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:46,986
in the street or sidewalk
or anything crazy like that.

88
00:02:46,986 --> 00:02:48,434
Okay, no back flips either.

89
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,890
I don't want to see any back flips.

90
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,057
(playful piano music)

91
00:03:12,123 --> 00:03:13,562
- I'm Jared.

92
00:03:13,562 --> 00:03:14,395
- You are?

93
00:03:15,418 --> 00:03:18,387
What makes you look like Jared?

94
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,698
- You're not Jared, I'm Jared.

95
00:03:21,698 --> 00:03:23,448
I'm Jared, I'm Jared.

96
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,321
- Who are you now?

97
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,488
- I'm Jackson.

98
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:29,560
- Ellie kiss me on camera,

99
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,431
so people know we love each other.

100
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:33,687
- This is your motivation for the day.

101
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:35,770
- Oh wow, I am motivated!

102
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:38,700
- [Ellie] Bye, Mr. Cal.

103
00:03:39,985 --> 00:03:41,192
Bye bye.
- Say bye Mama.

104
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,253
- Bye.

105
00:03:42,253 --> 00:03:43,342
(laughing)

106
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:46,509
(twangy bright music)

107
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,558
- I've been walking like
this for 30 minutes,

108
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:54,466
just trying to get across the kitchen.

109
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,650
I just need to go to the bathroom.

110
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,900
(laughing)

111
00:04:13,941 --> 00:04:16,721
- You want to get 'em on video.

112
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:17,777
This is good stuff to pass down

113
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:18,610
to your kids.

114
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,928
(laughing)

115
00:04:19,928 --> 00:04:22,802
'Cause we're gonna be dead soon.

116
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:24,835
- And that is why we're vlogging.

117
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:28,574
So Jackson can see Grandpa do peaches.

118
00:04:28,574 --> 00:04:29,407
Good afternoon guys,

119
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:31,828
we are just waiting for Beau to show up

120
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:35,259
and that is all of the siblings but Julie.

121
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,492
We miss you Jules, okay,

122
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,640
so many people have been commenting

123
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,925
on all of our stuff,

124
00:04:39,925 --> 00:04:41,230
and have said oh your mom has posted

125
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,650
tons of pictures of her canning,

126
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:44,115
you guys should go can with her,

127
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:47,900
and that is exactly what we're doing.

128
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,467
The siblings are together.

129
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,795
All growing up we would always

130
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:53,243
get together and we would
can and bottle stuff,

131
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:55,649
and I think I probably have the record

132
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,186
of breaking the most Mason jars.

133
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:01,930
- If you want a box of
peaches, you're gonna help.

134
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:03,512
- [Ellie] Yeah, yep.

135
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,845
- Scaled down cheese grater.

136
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:08,672
- Like take a picture of a cheese grater

137
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:12,554
and have that as the page,
you know, the numbers?

138
00:05:12,554 --> 00:05:13,387
So with Mom's cheese grater.

139
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,533
- Oh with Mom's cheese
grater as the numbers?

140
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:17,602
- So we want to do in everyone's kitchen,

141
00:05:17,602 --> 00:05:19,464
so we'll do some recipes in mine,

142
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:21,055
some in Ellie's, some in Ruby's,

143
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,660
and on on yours, we definitely
want to do the grape

144
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,236
so we can have your barn.

145
00:05:25,236 --> 00:05:26,725
- No, I want it in my house,

146
00:05:26,725 --> 00:05:28,470
because those are my grandkids.

147
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,533
I want it at my house.

148
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,152
- Yeah, I think this would
be the best place for it.

149
00:05:32,152 --> 00:05:32,985
- And then we'll have to
shove 'em out the door

150
00:05:32,985 --> 00:05:35,881
and then everybody can just clean 'em up.

151
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:37,481
- And this is something
Ellie and I thought

152
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:38,933
for a long time, is it's like okay

153
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,348
if we don't get this done now,

154
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:43,076
it's not gonna happen.

155
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,258
We all have so much that we're like,

156
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,369
oh I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna do this,

157
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:50,081
and if this didn't happen right now,

158
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,337
it wouldn't have happened.

159
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:54,157
- Well and unfortunately
the kids aren't getting

160
00:05:54,157 --> 00:05:55,900
any younger, they're getting older.

161
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,173
And it'll be soon enough
that Ruby's having

162
00:05:58,173 --> 00:05:59,710
Thanksgiving on her own.

163
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,636
Because her kids and their family

164
00:06:02,636 --> 00:06:03,469
is coming together.

165
00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:06,302
It's a natural process of family's

166
00:06:08,477 --> 00:06:09,489
- [Bonnie] Evolving.

167
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,489
- Devolving, dissolving?

168
00:06:12,952 --> 00:06:14,853
- We are on a mission
to dissolve the family.

169
00:06:14,853 --> 00:06:17,327
(laughing)

170
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,902
- No, well they just get so big,

171
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,402
that they kind of.

172
00:06:21,456 --> 00:06:22,909
- [Ellie] And you want your own time.

173
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:23,742
- Yeah.

174
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:25,647
- It's not that you want to tear away

175
00:06:25,647 --> 00:06:26,632
and break the family up,

176
00:06:26,632 --> 00:06:28,688
but it's just something that happens.

177
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:32,337
We want to do this now,
while we're still young.

178
00:06:32,337 --> 00:06:34,051
- And mostly we want to do this

179
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:35,661
before Ruby's channel gets too big,

180
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,150
and she won't want help us.

181
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,889
(laughing)

182
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:40,972
- I deserve a bigger cut.

183
00:06:43,089 --> 00:06:47,321
- We thought the idea was
going to be to help you.

184
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,154
And now.

185
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:49,741
- [Ellie] That was before
anyone had channels.

186
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:51,658
- you're gonna help us.

187
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:56,298
- [Jennifer] That is the funniest thing.

188
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:59,405
- And that is a wrap
of our family meeting.

189
00:06:59,405 --> 00:07:00,797
You guys probably already picked up

190
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,157
what we were talking about.

191
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:05,293
Our family is working on a long project

192
00:07:05,293 --> 00:07:06,629
that we've talked about,

193
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:10,462
like Bonnie says, before
Ruby and anyone else.

194
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:14,038
I think you maybe had a channel.

195
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:15,163
- It had just barely started.

196
00:07:15,163 --> 00:07:18,384
- But I had talked about doing a cookbook

197
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:21,103
and then doing a family cookbook,

198
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:23,120
and it's been in the works,

199
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,744
it's been talked about for a long time.

200
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,575
Today we are having a meeting,

201
00:07:26,575 --> 00:07:27,832
we have a photographer,

202
00:07:27,832 --> 00:07:29,716
we're going to be doing some cooking.

203
00:07:29,716 --> 00:07:33,299
So this is gonna be a
fun, long year ahead.

204
00:07:35,062 --> 00:07:36,762
- Thanks for getting the ball rolling.

205
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,639
- [Ellie] I know, Bonnie
got it kick started so.

206
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:40,797
Good girl.

207
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:42,273
One two three

208
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:43,833
- [All] Griffiths cookbook!

209
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:44,984
- [Ellie] Woo!

210
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,913
- So my family and I have
been texting each other

211
00:07:46,913 --> 00:07:48,449
and my sister in law Maria told me

212
00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:51,345
that there have been
some earthquakes in Utah,

213
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,178
and in southern Idaho,

214
00:07:52,178 --> 00:07:53,898
specifically in southern Idaho.

215
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:57,789
Apparently there was like
a 5.3 on the Richter scale.

216
00:07:57,789 --> 00:07:59,418
I can't remember off

217
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,410
I'm talking right now,

218
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:03,111
so I can't thing about
what scale they used.

219
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:05,271
Anyway, but, it was a 5.3 earthquake

220
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:06,231
in southern Idaho,

221
00:08:06,231 --> 00:08:08,601
and that has been causing a
lot of other earthquakes here

222
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:10,168
in Utah, specifically Norman, Utah,

223
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,297
where we live.

224
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,401
I haven't been feeling any of it yet.

225
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:17,184
Jackson, have you been
feeling any earthquakes?

226
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:18,017
- Nope.

227
00:08:18,017 --> 00:08:19,017
- Yeah, me either.

228
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:20,073
Did you know that
- Fruit snack.

229
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,620
- Oh you found a fruit snack?

230
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,615
Did you know that there's been

231
00:08:22,615 --> 00:08:24,392
some earthquakes in Utah today?

232
00:08:24,392 --> 00:08:25,225
- Yeah.

233
00:08:25,225 --> 00:08:26,168
- That's crazy.

234
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:28,906
I've actually never felt an earthquake.

235
00:08:28,906 --> 00:08:30,631
And obviously a lot of my friends

236
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:32,912
live in California, feel
earthquakes quite a bit.

237
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,168
And I think that's something
that I would kind of

238
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:37,864
worry about, because I've
never experienced it.

239
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,000
But Yellowstone had an
earthquake yesterday,

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,552
southern Idaho had an earthquake today,

241
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:45,280
Utah's been having some
small earthquakes today.

242
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,080
It kind of worries me a little bit.

243
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,631
I hope that everything's gonna be okay

244
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:52,214
and Utah has been known
for years and years

245
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:56,119
to be ready, I'm not sure what that means,

246
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,202
for a massive earthquake.

247
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:00,749
So who knows when that's gonna happen.

248
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,677
People have been saying
that for years and years,

249
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:04,661
and it's never happened,

250
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:06,221
so I don't know, we'll see,

251
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:07,054
we'll keep our eyes out.

252
00:09:07,054 --> 00:09:08,654
Hey, if you guys are in southern Idaho,

253
00:09:08,654 --> 00:09:09,982
did you feel the earthquake?

254
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,374
Anyone here in Utah, they
said you'd be able to feel it

255
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:14,014
all the way down to Salt Lake,

256
00:09:14,014 --> 00:09:15,935
that's about an hour and a half, two hours

257
00:09:15,935 --> 00:09:17,361
away from where we live.

258
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,169
So we're gonna keep
our feet on the ground,

259
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:20,466
see if we can feel any earthquakes

260
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:22,140
and go from there.

261
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,979
Okay, Jackson, your job,

262
00:09:23,979 --> 00:09:26,348
is to let me know if you
feel any earthquakes, okay?

263
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,181
- Okay.

264
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,764
(lively music)

265
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:58,563
- [Ellie] Well it's all fun and games

266
00:09:58,563 --> 00:10:01,009
until the boys get hangry.

267
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:03,273
(Ellie laughing)

268
00:10:03,273 --> 00:10:04,602
So Dad's got his food,

269
00:10:04,602 --> 00:10:05,969
Beau's is coming.

270
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:07,346
We're working on peach pie filling.

271
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:08,985
We are doing three recipes today

272
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:10,985
of bottled canned goods.

273
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,254
- Sugar.

274
00:10:14,254 --> 00:10:16,225
- [Ellie] Don't tell, no one knows.

275
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:18,822
Mom can do this without cutting herself.

276
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:21,572
20 years of, 30 years of canning.

277
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:25,091
(laughing)

278
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,843
- Gotcha!

279
00:10:34,144 --> 00:10:35,061
Whoa, whoa!

280
00:10:38,296 --> 00:10:40,269
Okay, you guys ready?

281
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:41,357
- Yep.

282
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:42,325
- Here we go.

283
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,534
This is a story called,

284
00:10:43,534 --> 00:10:46,493
What Does it Mean to Be Kind?

285
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:50,576
Being kind means smiling
at the new kid in class.

286
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:54,045
Giving someone a compliment.

287
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:57,053
Holding the door open for someone else.

288
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,781
Sticking up for someone
who's being bullied.

289
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,221
Seeing the best in people,

290
00:11:01,221 --> 00:11:04,030
even when they're
struggling to be their best.

291
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,341
Did you guys have fun today?

292
00:11:05,341 --> 00:11:06,541
- Yes.

293
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,538
- [Jared] Is your favorite part rocking

294
00:11:07,538 --> 00:11:09,089
in the rocking chair, Calvin?

295
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:10,129
- Yeah.

296
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:11,385
(Jared laughs)

297
00:11:11,385 --> 00:11:14,390
- I bet you guys are not
ready for bed yet, are you?

298
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,223
- Oh.

299
00:11:15,223 --> 00:11:16,056
- No?

300
00:11:16,056 --> 00:11:17,784
Oh, did he bonk your head?

301
00:11:17,784 --> 00:11:19,493
Aw, I'm sorry.

302
00:11:19,493 --> 00:11:20,326
- I bumped.

303
00:11:20,326 --> 00:11:22,148
- You bumped him, huh?

304
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,806
Well that's what happens
when you're having a little

305
00:11:23,806 --> 00:11:26,110
too much fun, sometimes you bonk heads.

306
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,445
Sometimes you bonk heads.

307
00:11:27,445 --> 00:11:29,574
Okay, give me a kiss.

308
00:11:29,574 --> 00:11:30,824
Give me a kiss.

309
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,413
Give each other kisses.

310
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:35,246
Good.

311
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,189
Say good night to our friends.

312
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,205
- Good night.

313
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:38,038
- [Jared] Good night.

314
00:11:38,038 --> 00:11:39,495
Calvin can you say bye bye to our friends?

315
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:41,068
- Bye.

316
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,269
- I came home to everybody asleep.

317
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,533
Guys I had such a fun night
starting a new project

318
00:11:46,533 --> 00:11:48,156
with my family.

319
00:11:48,156 --> 00:11:50,916
We have so much stuff that we are going

320
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,572
to be filming and doing in the next year

321
00:11:53,572 --> 00:11:56,967
to contribute to this fun family cookbook.

322
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,222
A lot of emotions are gonna be in this,

323
00:11:59,222 --> 00:12:01,599
we talked a lot tonight about how we want

324
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:03,016
the layout to be.

325
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,426
It's coming from our hearts,

326
00:12:05,426 --> 00:12:07,459
and I'm very excited to do this.

327
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:09,554
Thank you guys so much for watching.

328
00:12:09,554 --> 00:12:11,394
Don't forget to hit that subscribe button

329
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,747

on Jackson's first day of pre-school.

331
00:12:14,330 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
