1
00:00:00,063 --> 00:00:01,421
- Good morning, everybody!

2
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:03,770
I have made it to the fireplace

3
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:05,714
and I don't think I'm gonna get up.

4
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:07,503
I grabbed my sheets to
go put them in the wash

5
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:11,186
and then I literally sat down
just from walking two feet.

6
00:00:11,186 --> 00:00:12,970
I'm like, "Mm, I'm just gonna sit here."

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:13,803
We,

8
00:00:14,669 --> 00:00:16,556
mister no pictures please,

9
00:00:16,556 --> 00:00:19,973
we need to take the tree and decorate it.

10
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,386
(Calvin laughs)

11
00:00:23,386 --> 00:00:24,884
Maybe in a few days.

12
00:00:24,884 --> 00:00:25,760
That's what we need to do.

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,256
Do you wanna come touch it?

14
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:28,135
Calvin?

15
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:28,968
- [Calvin] No.

16
00:00:28,968 --> 00:00:31,393
- [Ellie] Aww, I'm gonna touch the tree.

17
00:00:31,393 --> 00:00:32,305
- [Calvin] Yeah!

18
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:33,504
- [Mpm] Oh, now you want to?

19
00:00:33,504 --> 00:00:34,337
Come here, touch it.

20
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:35,316
Go, oh!

21
00:00:35,316 --> 00:00:36,637
We've been touching it this morning

22
00:00:36,637 --> 00:00:38,580
and pretending that it hurts.

23
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,905
- Ow!

24
00:00:39,905 --> 00:00:41,992
- [Ellie] Ow, that hurts on your back?

25
00:00:41,992 --> 00:00:42,895
- Yeah!

26
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,278
- [Ellie] Or, is it a good back scratcher?

27
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:45,445
Oo, your head!

28
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:50,336
Your neck?

29
00:00:50,336 --> 00:00:52,842
(laughs)

30
00:00:52,842 --> 00:00:53,753
You're crazy!

31
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:58,188
Hey, do you know that
used to be mama's truck?

32
00:00:58,188 --> 00:00:59,965
And you put Peppa in the truck?

33
00:00:59,965 --> 00:01:00,798
- Yeah!

34
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:01,749
(Ellie laughs)

35
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:04,157
- I hope we're gonna
be able to get him out.

36
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:05,680
Oh, we can, good.

37
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,161
It's a good thing he is playing right now

38
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,974
because I have mustered up enough energy

39
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:14,006
to kind of get ready a little bit.

40
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,696
And I'm using the last
of our carpet cleaner.

41
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:18,643
Or cleaner.

42
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,868
The Folex has been my favorite thing

43
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:21,746
for the carpet.

44
00:01:21,746 --> 00:01:23,197
You guys suggested it to me.

45
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:25,023
But I just gotta clean up some spots,

46
00:01:25,023 --> 00:01:27,241
that's soap that Calvin
decided to put there.

47
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:30,669
It's applesauce that I
let the kids eat in here.

48
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:31,660
Just got to clean it up.

49
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,648
You know what I'm really
grateful for today?

50
00:01:33,648 --> 00:01:35,341
Is I'm really grateful

51
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:38,918
that there are still just a
few days left of November.

52
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,489
It kind of gives me,

53
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:42,284
I think I would feel a little antsy

54
00:01:42,284 --> 00:01:44,255
if it was already December.

55
00:01:44,255 --> 00:01:45,774
'Cause we have a lot we want to do,

56
00:01:45,774 --> 00:01:47,391
and a lot to do.

57
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:49,788
But I feel really good that
there are still a few days left

58
00:01:49,788 --> 00:01:51,449
that I can kind of

59
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:53,536
lay around, slowly do some things,

60
00:01:53,536 --> 00:01:55,824
and then really get into

61
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,888
the Christmas season
and spirit in December.

62
00:01:59,888 --> 00:02:01,776
I'm excited to decorate it

63
00:02:01,776 --> 00:02:04,555
after I get a few things like this done,

64
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:06,955
like wipe up my house.

65
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:09,288
Look at Mama so I can see your face.

66
00:02:09,288 --> 00:02:10,321
Does that work?

67
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:11,155
- Yeah!

68
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,103
- He wanted a hat.

69
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,029
(laughs)

70
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:16,578
We'll see what Jackson thinks of that.

71
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:18,761
We've gotta go pick up
Jackson from school,

72
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:20,637
and I don't know if Jackson's

73
00:02:20,637 --> 00:02:21,958
gonna like him wearing his hat,

74
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,281
but he wanted to wear a hat.

75
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,439
I think he'll be fine.

76
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,964
Well, the hat situation went smooth.

77
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:30,680
Jackson got out of the car and goes,

78
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,513
"That's--"

79
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:32,477
- I want to hold your hand.

80
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:33,577
- Aww.

81
00:02:33,577 --> 00:02:36,480
No, I'm holding Jackson's right now.

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,860
See, and then I'll hold yours
when we leave the store.

83
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,693
Hurry, look!

84
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,637
Is there a car?

85
00:02:40,637 --> 00:02:42,328
Let's walk, let's walk.

86
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,506
When Jackson got out of the
car, he saw Calvin and goes,

87
00:02:44,506 --> 00:02:45,496
"That's my hat."

88
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:47,859
Are you okay that
Calvin's wearing your hat?

89
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:49,359
- No.

90
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:51,737
- [Ellie] He'll just
borrow it for the day.

91
00:02:51,737 --> 00:02:53,348
- Why is he borrowing it?

92
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,685
- [Ellie] 'Cause he really
wanted to wear a hat.

93
00:02:54,685 --> 00:02:57,768
(light guitar music)

94
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,312
- All right, listen up!

95
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:09,344
Here's the situation.

96
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:10,800
Here is the deal!

97
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,771
My wife is not happy

98
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,567
and I aim to please her!

99
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:15,010
I aim to make her happy,

100
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:16,037
to make her laugh,

101
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,431
and to make her smile!

102
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,633
'Cause she's my wife!

103
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,794
She's my wife

104
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:22,193
and I want to make my wife a happy woman!

105
00:03:22,193 --> 00:03:25,618
- The sad thing is nobody ever sees

106
00:03:25,618 --> 00:03:27,436
the real you.

107
00:03:27,436 --> 00:03:28,269
- Yeah.

108
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:29,776
'Cause I did this all before.

109
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,857
- No, he didn't do this.

110
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:33,837
He did the funniest shiz

111
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,599
I have ever seen and I literally thought,

112
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,275
where the is the camera?

113
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:42,782
The time I laugh at you
and sometimes I feel like

114
00:03:42,782 --> 00:03:45,749
it may look like I'm
annoyed, which I'm not.

115
00:03:45,749 --> 00:03:48,171
- This is literally the
second time I'm doing this,

116
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:49,675
because I thought it was funny enough

117
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,669
to pull out the camera.

118
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:52,298
We couldn't find it.
- I told Jared,

119
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,779
I went back to Lowe's.

120
00:03:53,779 --> 00:03:54,612
- [Jared] Yeah.

121
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:56,499
- I said, "I need these
blocks cut this way."

122
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,261
- Because they weren't square!

123
00:03:58,261 --> 00:04:00,128
- They didn't cut them the way I thought

124
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,774
that they did yesterday.

125
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:02,607
- [Jared] Yeah.

126
00:04:02,607 --> 00:04:04,615
- And the guy said "We
can't do 'em that small".

127
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:06,860
And I said "Okay, you did it yesterday."

128
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,543
He goes, "Well I didn't do it yesterday."

129
00:04:08,543 --> 00:04:10,067
And I'm like, "Aw, shi."

130
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,372
I was like, "Okay."

131
00:04:11,372 --> 00:04:13,186
So I said, "So, I can't get it done."

132
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,019
He's like, "Nope."

133
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,077
And I said, "'Kay."

134
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:17,519
I wasn't gonna fight it,
I had two screaming kids.

135
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,584
And I said "'Kay."

136
00:04:18,584 --> 00:04:20,824
So I came home and told
Jared the girls were gonna

137
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:22,897
be fine with the size, but it's fine.

138
00:04:22,897 --> 00:04:23,808
And he said.

139
00:04:23,808 --> 00:04:24,676
- I'm gonna go back to Lowe's

140
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:25,697
and you know what I'm gonna tell 'em?

141
00:04:25,697 --> 00:04:27,268
I'm gonna go tell 'em to suck an egg!

142
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:28,101
(laughing)

143
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:28,934
- And then he said, "And then you know

144
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:29,767
"what I'm gonna go do?

145
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:30,600
"I'm gonna go to my Mom's."

146
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,122
(laughing)

147
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:33,438
It was funny in the moment!

148
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,102
- It was funny in the moment.

149
00:04:35,102 --> 00:04:38,633
So Mom has a band saw and
a chop saw and a sander.

150
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:39,665
It's actually my chop saw.

151
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:40,978
So I'm gonna take these.
- [Ellie] So her garage is

152
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:41,927
more manly than ours.

153
00:04:41,927 --> 00:04:44,360
- Hey, hey, half of it is my stuff!

154
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,611
(Ellie laughs)

155
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,069
And, so we're gonna cut these down to size

156
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:49,306
and I'm gonna take the kids with me

157
00:04:49,306 --> 00:04:51,633
or at least one of 'em or
none of 'em, I don't know.

158
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:54,209
Just whatever, whatever makes Ellie happy!

159
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:56,073
'Cause that's what we're aiming to do!

160
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,773
She's got this assignment
in a couple of hours

161
00:04:58,773 --> 00:05:02,304
for the church, and I
want to make this right.

162
00:05:02,304 --> 00:05:03,137
So the kids and I are like--

163
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,570
- It'll be fine.

164
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,536
Girls don't care, it would still be fine.

165
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:07,619
But it just was not,

166
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,319
I was like, "Dang it."

167
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,932
You know, I was like, "Sure."

168
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,273
- So I'm taking matters into my own hands.

169
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,902
Have I said that four times already?

170
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:16,985
(heavy guitar music)

171
00:05:57,484 --> 00:05:59,151
Shoot 'em with webs!

172
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,532
Ah, you got 'em!

173
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,413
Your husband has returned!

174
00:06:06,413 --> 00:06:07,711
And I have good news.

175
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:10,307
Penny, this is cool stuff
but it is not for you to see,

176
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:11,501
this is for Mom.

177
00:06:11,501 --> 00:06:13,714
It's not perfect, okay, but it's a heck

178
00:06:13,714 --> 00:06:15,006
of a lot better than it was before.

179
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:18,414
- Who needs Lowe's when
I have the best husband?

180
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,692
- Oh, thanks.

181
00:06:19,692 --> 00:06:21,471
- That is much better.
- Look how square and

182
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,762
perfect those are, Ellie.

183
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:23,719
- Thank you.

184
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:24,667
- You are so welcome.

185
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:25,652
You know what?

186
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:28,161
I even cut extra so in
case some of the girls

187
00:06:28,161 --> 00:06:30,374
want to try over, start over, or mess up

188
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:31,207
or anything,
- That would be cute.

189
00:06:31,207 --> 00:06:32,840
- There's extra for everyone.

190
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,581
We just gotta sand some of this down.

191
00:06:34,581 --> 00:06:36,261
- That's cute.
- You are all set to go

192
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:37,130
for your December countdown.
- Well, thank you.

193
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,547
I'm actually ready to go now.

194
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:41,692
- Well guess what?

195
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,314
Those were done an hour ago.

196
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,360
- [Ellie] Thank you.

197
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,366
- Woof!

198
00:06:45,366 --> 00:06:46,199
We're good.
- I appreciate it.

199
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,234
- You're welcome, hey.

200
00:06:47,234 --> 00:06:48,067
I love you.

201
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:48,900
- Ew!

202
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,814
Hey, now I, ugh!

203
00:06:50,814 --> 00:06:54,051
(Jared making silly noises)

204
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:57,761
I wanna be really grateful,
but I'm also just like ugh!

205
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,990
(Jared laughs)

206
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,721
- The kids are going crazy right now.

207
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,879
And Penny is going crazy right now!

208
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:06,722
Hey, she is ready to go on a walk

209
00:07:06,722 --> 00:07:08,521
and she knows she's gonna go on one.

210
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:10,169
So we're gonna go on a walk, okay?

211
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:12,582
- [Ellie] It's just getting
towards the end of the evening,

212
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:15,122
and I don't know if I have any left in me.

213
00:07:15,122 --> 00:07:15,955
(laughs)

214
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:17,051
- Let's go on a walk, sister.

215
00:07:17,051 --> 00:07:17,884
Let's go for a walk.
- I don't have much

216
00:07:17,884 --> 00:07:19,159
left in me.

217
00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:20,849
Can you guys hear this?

218
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:23,432
(kids talking)

219
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:27,647
Oh my gosh, unlock the door, Cal!

220
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,363
Jackson, every time he
goes to the bathroom,

221
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:31,095
Calvin thinks that's
the perfect time to go

222
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:34,409
and demolish the bathroom
with toilet paper.

223
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:36,817
But Calvin just has come out of his shell,

224
00:07:36,817 --> 00:07:39,304
the last few weeks,
and has just gone wild.

225
00:07:39,304 --> 00:07:40,137
(metal crashes)

226
00:07:40,137 --> 00:07:41,104
Calvin!

227
00:07:41,104 --> 00:07:42,959
I told you to unlock the door.

228
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,377
Look at me!

229
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:46,161
Look at Mom!

230
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:47,328
Don't lock it.

231
00:07:48,254 --> 00:07:49,087
Calvin,

232
00:07:50,072 --> 00:07:52,311
was that naughty to do?

233
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,144
Wow, 'kay.

234
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:58,032
- [Jared] Penny, are you ready?

235
00:07:58,032 --> 00:07:59,615
Wait, take a break!

236
00:08:00,457 --> 00:08:01,290
Good girl!

237
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,618
Okay, are you ready to have some fun?

238
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:04,451
- Yeah.

239
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,592
- [Jared] Okay, come on, Calvin!

240
00:08:07,592 --> 00:08:10,942
Come on bud, you're doing great!

241
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:11,958
Oh, what is that?

242
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,598
Do you have a rock in your mouth?

243
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:14,848
Is that a rock?

244
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,235
Is that a rock?

245
00:08:18,235 --> 00:08:19,133
Oh wow.

246
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:20,027
Sucking on a rock.

247
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:21,729
Do you want to keep this
for your rock collection?

248
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:22,562
- Yeah!

249
00:08:22,562 --> 00:08:24,220
- Okay well let me put it in my pocket.

250
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,494
That way you don't have
to hold it in your mouth.

251
00:08:25,494 --> 00:08:26,327
That's yucky.

252
00:08:26,327 --> 00:08:27,160
Let's go!

253
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,871
It is such a beautiful
day, and we all needed

254
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:31,049
to get out of the house today, huh.

255
00:08:31,049 --> 00:08:33,440
And so we're riding our bikes,
taking Penny for a walk.

256
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,469
And it's beautiful outside today.

257
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:38,542
It's not that chilly, which
is so surprising for Utah.

258
00:08:38,542 --> 00:08:41,554
Because it's end of November,
it's almost December.

259
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,122
There's no snow, and
it's not even freezing.

260
00:08:45,122 --> 00:08:46,072
It's not even cold.

261
00:08:46,072 --> 00:08:48,222
The kids do not want to wear jackets.

262
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:50,304
And I'm kind of like, "You
guys should wear jackets."

263
00:08:50,304 --> 00:08:51,298
But they're like, "No way!"

264
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:53,490
We're pumping iron here!

265
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,280
We're riding our bikes, we're going quick!

266
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,506
We're gettin' the blood flowing,
we're having a good time!

267
00:08:57,506 --> 00:08:59,632
That's what we're doing.

268
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:00,869
But it's beautiful out here.

269
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:04,026
I love the blue sky, I love
the mountains, I love my kids,

270
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:06,080
I love my dog, we're having fun!

271
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,211
- We're going rock hill!

272
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:09,130
- [Jared] We're going to
the rock hill, that's right!

273
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:10,827
Ready, set,

274
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,117
go!

275
00:09:12,117 --> 00:09:13,814
(hums Lone Ranger theme)

276
00:09:13,814 --> 00:09:14,647
Oh, don't stop.

277
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:15,480
Keep going!

278
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,730
Ready, set, go!

279
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:19,347
Aw, crash!

280
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:20,180
Oh no!

281
00:09:21,165 --> 00:09:22,980
Oh no, he's crashed!

282
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,730
What are we gonna do?

283
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,702
We're gonna get back up, that's right!

284
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:30,154
Get back up and try again!

285
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:32,321
On your mark, get set, go!

286
00:09:34,146 --> 00:09:36,229
(laughs)

287
00:09:37,298 --> 00:09:38,131
- No!

288
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,548
- Ready, set, go!

289
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,110
Oh, he crashed again!

290
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:46,986
Oh, you crashed too!

291
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:47,986
Penny, come!

292
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,253
Good girl!

293
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,688
Good girl, Penny!

294
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:53,521
Good girl!

295
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,363
Careful, go under!

296
00:09:55,363 --> 00:09:57,422
Go under, go under!

297
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,505
There you go.

298
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,261
(Calvin laughing)

299
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,094
(Jackson yelling)

300
00:10:09,305 --> 00:10:11,626
I somehow knew this was gonna happen.

301
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:12,569
Carrying everything

302
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:15,188
but I didn't think it
would happen this fast.

303
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,021
Let's go!

304
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:17,732
(laughs)

305
00:10:17,732 --> 00:10:20,232
(Ellie gasps)

306
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,923
- Oh my gosh, what's going on?

307
00:10:26,146 --> 00:10:27,063
So, I left.

308
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,035
I just got back from activities,

309
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:31,398
we're back in the bathroom guys.

310
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:32,710
Today we're in the bathroom,

311
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,851
and I heard Jackson downstairs saying,

312
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,349
"Calvin, hurry hurry hurry!

313
00:10:36,349 --> 00:10:37,683
"You gotta put the seat down!"

314
00:10:37,683 --> 00:10:40,502
And you were helping him get undressed!

315
00:10:40,502 --> 00:10:42,285
To go potty!

316
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,118
Why did you do that?

317
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:44,951
- Because.

318
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:46,856
- [Ellie] Jackson, thank you!

319
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:47,806
- You're welcome.

320
00:10:47,806 --> 00:10:49,509
- I'm so proud of you!

321
00:10:49,509 --> 00:10:50,452
Thank you!

322
00:10:50,452 --> 00:10:53,097
Were you letting Jackson help you?

323
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:54,097
Thanks, wow.

324
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,608
(laughs)

325
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:58,164
I'm shocked, I'm speechless.

326
00:10:58,164 --> 00:10:59,280
I just grabbed the camera
as I was running downstairs.

327
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,468
- [Jackson] He's going in the toilet!

328
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:02,301
- Okay!

329
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:04,805
- [Jackson] Pop in the toilet.

330
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:06,347
- [Ellie] Do you want to go again?

331
00:11:06,347 --> 00:11:07,180
- No.

332
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,607
- [Ellie] What made you
think he needed to go potty,

333
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:09,808
did he tell you?

334
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:10,876
- [Jackson] Yeah.

335
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:14,162
- As I was putting Jackson
to bed I seriously had,

336
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:17,189
one of the sweetest moments with him.

337
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:19,821
And I feel like I have
a lot of sweet moments.

338
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:22,227
But I was putting him to
bed and he always asks,

339
00:11:22,227 --> 00:11:23,466
"What was I like as a baby?

340
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,508
"What was daddy like?"

341
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:28,071
Every night, that's our
routine, and we talk about it.

342
00:11:28,071 --> 00:11:30,621
And he was asking about the baby,

343
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:33,680
and we ended up talking about how I had

344
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,587
lost the baby before.

345
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:38,462
And how I said, "And we really are hoping

346
00:11:38,462 --> 00:11:40,186
"that this baby stays strong."

347
00:11:40,186 --> 00:11:41,322
So far this baby's strong

348
00:11:41,322 --> 00:11:44,079
but we're hoping it continues that way.

349
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,909
I've had Ruby and Julie,

350
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,477
they've both have had had ultrasounds

351
00:11:47,477 --> 00:11:50,247
and then a few weeks later
things don't look good, you know.

352
00:11:50,247 --> 00:11:54,825
You just never ever know
but Jackson brought it up.

353
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:56,651
And he said, and we had talked about

354
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,969
how I had lost the baby before,

355
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:00,164
and now this baby's
gonna be really strong.

356
00:12:00,164 --> 00:12:01,926
And I said, "Let's say a prayer

357
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:03,927
"and ask for this baby
to be really strong."

358
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,044
And so we said a prayer.

359
00:12:05,044 --> 00:12:06,998
And it was just so sweet.

360
00:12:06,998 --> 00:12:11,976
And he wanted to say it,
and it was just so sweet.

361
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:14,417
When Jared and I had
the miscarriage before,

362
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:15,865
we tried to get a babysitter.

363
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:18,778
My in-laws were out of town,
no one could watch the kids.

364
00:12:18,778 --> 00:12:21,109
But we didn't want Jackson
and Jared in the waiting room

365
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:23,207
because then it would be me by myself.

366
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:25,199
And it wasn't the ideal situation

367
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,215
and I knew that going in,

368
00:12:27,215 --> 00:12:28,320
but it was what it was.

369
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,705
And we were a family and we went in,

370
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,883
and it wasn't very good news.

371
00:12:31,883 --> 00:12:33,727
And Jackson's young.

372
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:37,002
And it wasn't my favorite
way that I wished that

373
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:39,435
I would have done things,
but that's how it was.

374
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:41,414
But it wasn't bad.

375
00:12:41,414 --> 00:12:45,923
It wasn't bad for him to
know that we were excited,

376
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:47,422
and we lost the baby.

377
00:12:47,422 --> 00:12:49,274
And now I'm pregnant again

378
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,673
and we waited a little bit to tell him.

379
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:54,120
It's still pretty early but we told him.

380
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,453
I am glad that we are doing it this way.

381
00:12:58,852 --> 00:13:00,652
When my aunt passed away,

382
00:13:00,652 --> 00:13:04,105
Jackson knew Aunt Sonia,
Jackson loved Aunt Sonia.

383
00:13:04,105 --> 00:13:04,973
He loved seeing her.

384
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,068
He would sit on her
lap, she would kiss him,

385
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:10,207
she would hug him, and when
she passed away, you know,

386
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,231
he's only four so he
doesn't quite grasp it.

387
00:13:12,231 --> 00:13:16,398
But often he has mentioned
about Aunt Sonia and about her.

388
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,292
It's just, you know, it's just..

389
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,020
And so I just really enjoyed having

390
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,930
a very sweet and tender
moment with Jackson,

391
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:31,620
and for him to remember
that we had lost a baby,

392
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,557
and that he thought about that.

393
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:37,307
He's just been really cute to me.

394
00:13:38,214 --> 00:13:42,297
Jackson is only four but
I swear his soul is old.

395
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:46,537
So he's always been a comforter to me.

396
00:13:46,537 --> 00:13:50,192
And Jackson has always
been a comforter to others.

397
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,728
I don't think I ever leave a store

398
00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:56,181
without somebody commenting about Jackson.

399
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:57,097
Strangers.

400
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,702
Old grandpas.

401
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:00,486
"What a good boy you are."

402
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:03,816
It's not a coincidence that
everyone comments about him.

403
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:05,339
Strangers in public.

404
00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:07,945
He just radiates love.

405
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,543
And I'm so grateful that he's mine.

406
00:14:10,543 --> 00:14:11,871
I'm so grateful that Jared and I

407
00:14:11,871 --> 00:14:14,131
are trusted to have him.

408
00:14:14,131 --> 00:14:17,480
And I'm going to stop boobing,
because no one likes a boob.

409
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,207
And I boob plenty.

410
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:22,543
People are like, they don't
like me boobin'. (laughs)

411
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:25,856
But I just wanted to share
this with future Ellie

412
00:14:25,856 --> 00:14:28,286
and future Jackson to look back on.

413
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:31,458
This is why we vlog, this
is why I do what I do.

414
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:35,943
I live in the moment and
I capture what I want.

415
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:37,838
I'm grateful for that.

416
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:40,336
And I'm grateful that,

417
00:14:40,336 --> 00:14:42,075
not only that I'm able
to share with others,

418
00:14:42,075 --> 00:14:43,928
and I'm so grateful for
everybody's stories.

419
00:14:43,928 --> 00:14:45,301
You all have been so kind.

420
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,101
I've loved hearing your stories.

421
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,945
Especially on Twitter, I've
been really interactive there.

422
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:51,028
Really appreciate it.

423
00:14:51,028 --> 00:14:53,168
I'm gonna go ahead and end the vlog

424
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:56,861
and take a bath, relax (chuckles),

425
00:14:56,861 --> 00:14:59,382
drink lots of water because
I'm feeling like I need it.

426
00:14:59,382 --> 00:15:01,580
And I will see you guys tomorrow.

427
00:15:01,580 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
