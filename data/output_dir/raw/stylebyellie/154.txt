1
00:00:00,197 --> 00:00:02,296
- Last night when we were
putting all the kids to bed,

2
00:00:02,296 --> 00:00:04,600
we said, if you go to bed really good,

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:06,528
when you wake up, we'll get in the hot tub

4
00:00:06,528 --> 00:00:09,372
and then at 6:55, the sun wasn't up yet,

5
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:12,355
everybody had their swimming suits on.

6
00:00:12,355 --> 00:00:14,170
Who pushed pause?

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,003
- [Julie] It's loading.

8
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:15,836
- Oh it's loading.

9
00:00:15,836 --> 00:00:18,607
Perfect, let me finish
my conversation then.

10
00:00:18,607 --> 00:00:20,006
And so everyone got in the hot tub

11
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:23,143
and now that we are all
dressed and ready for the day

12
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:25,627
- We're watching the Emoji movie.

13
00:00:25,627 --> 00:00:28,403
- We are, the first time we've seen it.

14
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,236
If you guys have seen it,

15
00:00:29,236 --> 00:00:30,069
tell me what you think.

16
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,623
So far it's kind of cute.

17
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:33,471
But my internet's lame,

18
00:00:33,471 --> 00:00:36,114
so we'll just sit here a second and wait.

19
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:37,197
- Give me it.

20
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:40,241
- [Ellie] Is that your toy?

21
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:42,160
Alright come up here,
it's working in my room.

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,077
(enchanting music)

23
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:59,986
Internet connection's
better up here, so pile on.

24
00:00:59,986 --> 00:01:01,338
- Last night was wonderful,

25
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:03,747
mainly for one reason, my
air mattress didn't pop

26
00:01:03,747 --> 00:01:05,738
last night, so I actually
slept pretty well,

27
00:01:05,738 --> 00:01:06,918
how about you Lando?

28
00:01:06,918 --> 00:01:08,755
- I guess Joel kept the
place warm all night.

29
00:01:08,755 --> 00:01:09,761
- [Jared] How'd you sleep man?

30
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:10,841
- I slept great,

31
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,849
except for when it got cold.

32
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,537
And I had to get up and
put wood on the fire.

33
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:14,556
- [Jared] Did you sleep good Lando?

34
00:01:14,556 --> 00:01:15,389
- I did.

35
00:01:15,389 --> 00:01:17,914
I gotta get this flashlight off here.

36
00:01:17,914 --> 00:01:20,037
- Oh here, get on my shoulders.

37
00:01:20,037 --> 00:01:22,698
(playful music)

38
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:23,562
- I'm not gonna hurt ya?

39
00:01:23,562 --> 00:01:24,395
- No.

40
00:01:26,106 --> 00:01:27,049
- [Landon] I will try
to bear as much weight

41
00:01:27,049 --> 00:01:29,549
- Why are your knees so sharp?

42
00:01:30,587 --> 00:01:33,341
You have abnormally sharp knees Landon.

43
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:35,876
Okay now walk us over.

44
00:01:35,876 --> 00:01:36,709
You got it?

45
00:01:36,709 --> 00:01:37,542
- Yeah.

46
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:38,375
- You have it already?

47
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:39,208
- Yeah.

48
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,033
- [Jared] You do?

49
00:01:41,033 --> 00:01:42,341
Oh you got it okay.

50
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,174
Okay.

51
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,653
- [Landon] Slowly.

52
00:01:45,653 --> 00:01:47,153
- Are you hanging?

53
00:01:48,824 --> 00:01:51,174
(laughing)

54
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:53,214
I've got ya, I've got ya.

55
00:01:53,214 --> 00:01:54,047
Okay okay.

56
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:56,488
Landon, we're safe.

57
00:01:56,488 --> 00:01:58,238
I got you, I got you.

58
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:00,552
- It's too late.

59
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:02,488
- [Jared] I guess we
could've used the ladder.

60
00:02:02,488 --> 00:02:03,380
- Yeah we could've used the ladder.

61
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,678
- Anyway, breakfast is almost ready.

62
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:10,261
We've got eggs and hash
browns and sausage.

63
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,277
Oh smiley.

64
00:02:13,277 --> 00:02:16,191
Look it's getting a smiley.
- Hey a smiley.

65
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:18,135
- [Jared] Smiley, that's so cool.

66
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:19,645
- [Joel] He's happy to see us.

67
00:02:19,645 --> 00:02:20,478
- [Jared] Good morning.

68
00:02:20,478 --> 00:02:21,311
- [Joel] Good mornin'.

69
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,145
- [Jared] Joel, how did you do that?

70
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:24,725
He's got a nose now too, that's amazing.

71
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:27,892
- Eyebrows eyebrows eyebrows eyebrows.

72
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,088
- Aww.
- Aww, boo.

73
00:02:30,088 --> 00:02:31,586
- [Jared] Hey it's Picasso.

74
00:02:31,586 --> 00:02:34,225
- Some people can make
apples look so pretty.

75
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:35,226
These aren't pretty,

76
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,393
but they're gonna be good.

77
00:02:38,856 --> 00:02:42,664
- [Ellie] I told Bonnie last
night that she was my Chloe.

78
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:45,664
- Because of all the stories I have?

79
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:50,519
- [Ellie] I don't know,
doesn't that look good?

80
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,167
- Chloe is hot right now.

81
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,838
- [Ellie] Well she always has been.

82
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:57,180
She's always been cute
and like my favorite.

83
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,608
- [Julie] I'm gonna go
with the stick, oh dear.

84
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:02,823
- [Ellie] Oh wow, and
you've got kids bumping

85
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:04,295
- I know look at all
these hands that are like,

86
00:03:04,295 --> 00:03:05,681
give me a chocolate.

87
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:06,963
- [Child] Give me a truck.

88
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,888
- [Bonnie] I'm not given you truck.

89
00:03:08,888 --> 00:03:09,805
- My truck,

90
00:03:11,216 --> 00:03:12,945
it's my truck.

91
00:03:12,945 --> 00:03:16,116
- [Ellie] You want to take another bite?

92
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:17,122
- [Julie] Emma, do you want one?

93
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:19,620
- [Ellie] Isn't that nice
of Aunt Julie to make?

94
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,667
Jules, thanks.

95
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,371
- You helped.

96
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:24,487
- [Ellie] I did the strawberries.

97
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:26,558
- Well see hers stayed on the bottom.

98
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:28,613
- [Ellie] Awesome.

99
00:03:28,613 --> 00:03:31,446
(whimsical music)

100
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,070
(spitting)

101
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,653
(bright music)

102
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,018
- Don't pull that, let me do it.

103
00:04:15,365 --> 00:04:17,426
(Ellie laughs)

104
00:04:17,426 --> 00:04:18,762
Are you laughing at me?

105
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,845
- [Julie] No.

106
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,338
We didn't do anything, okay?
- You're scary.

107
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:26,010
- Come on.
- Stop it.

108
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,760
- Cross your fingers.

109
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,077
- [Julie] They're all slippery.

110
00:04:31,077 --> 00:04:31,910
(groaning)

111
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,615
This house is secure.
- Yeah.

112
00:04:33,615 --> 00:04:35,865
(laughing)

113
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:40,351
And we're never getting in again.

114
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:44,377
- We are here eating some
lunch with the cousins.

115
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,108
We actually have someone
we're meeting here

116
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:47,963
to talk to a little bit later,

117
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:50,529
because my mom's is a
perfect middle point,

118
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,362
to where everyone lives,

119
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:53,659
so we're hanging out
here for a little bit,

120
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,792
waiting for the boys to
get back from their trip.

121
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:58,994
And their battery is dead
to get in their garage.

122
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:02,921
We changed the battery, it won't work,

123
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,966
so now we're trying to get inside.

124
00:05:04,966 --> 00:05:05,857
- I don't know, I'm at a loss.

125
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,686
- [Ellie] This one is the last option

126
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:10,189
that I think would be open.

127
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:11,189
Yes yes yes!

128
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:14,617
(screaming)

129
00:05:14,617 --> 00:05:16,050
- Somebody has to go up on the ladder.

130
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,452
- [Julie] Yeah who's
gonna jump through it.

131
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:19,226
- [Child] How are we gonna get in?

132
00:05:19,226 --> 00:05:21,809
(bright music)

133
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,623
- Mom can I jump that high?

134
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:53,032
- [Ellie] I don't know, I feel
like you're just too little.

135
00:05:53,032 --> 00:05:55,268
- I'm not too little.

136
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:56,886
- [Ellie] You think you could do it?

137
00:05:56,886 --> 00:05:57,719
- Yeah.

138
00:05:57,719 --> 00:05:59,606
- I'm worried.

139
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:01,856
- I want to jump that high.

140
00:06:03,752 --> 00:06:06,002
- [Ellie] Let's watch Cody.

141
00:06:06,893 --> 00:06:08,404
- [Jackson] I want to jump that high.

142
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:10,552
I want to jump that high.

143
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:12,278
I want to jump that high.

144
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,273
- [Ellie] You hold on so tight.

145
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,216
- Okay.

146
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:17,287
- [Ellie] No flips.

147
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:18,408
Go try it.

148
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:21,437
Oh my hell, let Cody go first.

149
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:25,918
I don't know what Jared's
gonna think of this.

150
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:27,918
Woo hoo, no flips Jacks.

151
00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:32,437
- Jackson Jackson!

152
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:33,604
- [Ellie] Woo!

153
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,670
- Yeah!

154
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,578
- [Ellie] What did you think, come here.

155
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:39,570
Come here.

156
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,030
What did you think about that?

157
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,310
- I want to do it again.

158
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,397
- [Ellie] Were you really high?

159
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:46,039
Were you afraid?

160
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,388
- I want to do it again.

161
00:06:47,388 --> 00:06:50,181
- Okay, so slow, wait for your cousins.

162
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:52,419
So growing up at my grandma's house,

163
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,700
she used to have a river in her backyard

164
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,452
and we were so young,

165
00:06:56,452 --> 00:06:59,068
I remember being four years old

166
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:00,695
in a life jacket in the river

167
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:02,284
and it would go left or right

168
00:07:02,284 --> 00:07:04,940
and you had to do the left one,

169
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,091
because if you got right,

170
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,016
it wasn't in her property anymore,

171
00:07:08,016 --> 00:07:10,186
so we'd swim as hard as hard as we could

172
00:07:10,186 --> 00:07:12,105
to go to the left to go in a circle

173
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:13,850
around my grandma's house.

174
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,531
And it was kinda scary
and that's kinda how

175
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:16,364
I feel about this.

176
00:07:16,364 --> 00:07:18,633
It's like it's a little nerveracking

177
00:07:18,633 --> 00:07:19,974
I mean it's not crazy high,

178
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:22,180
but just getting there,

179
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,917
you know it's nerve wracking.

180
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:25,750
Woo!

181
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:28,671
Jackson.

182
00:07:31,365 --> 00:07:32,532
- [Julie] Wow!

183
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,476
- [Ellie] Okay you go.

184
00:07:34,476 --> 00:07:36,519
One two three go.

185
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:39,102
(Ellie laughs)

186
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:45,232
- Wait, my hat's falling off.

187
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,758
- Come here mister.

188
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:47,930
What did you think of that?

189
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,986
- Good.

190
00:07:48,986 --> 00:07:49,873
- [Ellie] Were you scared?

191
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:50,706
- No.

192
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:54,071
- I almost didn't really
want you to do it.

193
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:54,904
- I wanted to.

194
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:56,072
- [Ellie] But you're pretty brave.

195
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:56,905
- Yeah.

196
00:07:56,905 --> 00:08:00,315
- [Ellie] I could see it
in your soul you wanted to.

197
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:03,230
- When we come back, I'm
gonna jump from there then.

198
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,091
- [Ellie] When we move the tramp,

199
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:07,808
when we move it back sometime, huh.

200
00:08:07,808 --> 00:08:09,467
- Yeah, I'm gonna go jump.

201
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:10,300
- Okay.

202
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:14,708
I don't think I ever laugh as much

203
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,252
as when I'm with Bonnie.

204
00:08:16,252 --> 00:08:17,172
- I don't know why.

205
00:08:17,172 --> 00:08:20,284
- And I think it's just
there's something there.

206
00:08:20,284 --> 00:08:23,620
Like I was thinking in
the car on the way here,

207
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,334
Cody rode with us, so
Jackson and Cody were talking

208
00:08:26,334 --> 00:08:27,579
and laughing the whole time

209
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,460
and I was trying to think

210
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,332
of the age difference between them.

211
00:08:30,332 --> 00:08:31,187
- Are they the same as us?

212
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:34,770
- They are, Cody's six
and Jackson's three,

213
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:37,910
so not quite as far as me and you,

214
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,158
but I was like okay.

215
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,207
You know what really makes me laugh

216
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:44,655
is that smile, say cheese.

217
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:45,488
- Cheese.

218
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:46,321
(laughs)

219
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:48,017
You got Oreo all over your teeth

220
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:49,424
and you smell like poop.

221
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:50,257
Did you poop?

222
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,110
- No.

223
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,084
- We need to go potty, huh?

224
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,834
Jackson, you have no fear my son.

225
00:08:57,056 --> 00:09:00,123
Is it because you're Spiderman?

226
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:03,373
Ah hey, don't kick me or I'll kick you.

227
00:09:04,896 --> 00:09:06,090
(laughing)

228
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:06,984
Turds.

229
00:09:06,984 --> 00:09:09,234
You seriously have no fear.

230
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:14,613
He just wants to run and play.

231
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,399
I'm glad that you like that.

232
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,823
Do you think Daddy's
gonna be proud of you?

233
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:19,656
- Yeah.

234
00:09:19,656 --> 00:09:21,867
- [Ellie] I think that was fun.

235
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:23,700
- That was funny that I kicked you.

236
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,826
- [Ellie] It wasn't funny, it hurt.

237
00:09:26,826 --> 00:09:28,411
Okay it was funny a little bit.

238
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,994
You're crazy, where did you go?

239
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:35,705
Did you know, that when I was your age,

240
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:38,089
that Mommy used to do this?

241
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:38,922
- Yeah.

242
00:09:38,922 --> 00:09:41,680
- [Ellie] Yep, when I
was your age, crazy huh.

243
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,632
I think I keep getting Bonnie's bad side.

244
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:47,192
(laughing)

245
00:09:47,192 --> 00:09:49,309
(lively guitar music)

246
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:52,226
Hey, you've been really mean today.

247
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,765
(laughing)

248
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,240
There's mean Aunt Bonnie,

249
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,407
pushing all the kids down.

250
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:12,642
Oh my gosh.

251
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:17,988
(laughing)

252
00:10:17,988 --> 00:10:18,905
Get set go!

253
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:22,707
- I need to jump.

254
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,207
- [Ellie] Okay, your turn Cal.

255
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:41,243
(Ellie laughs)

256
00:10:41,243 --> 00:10:43,682
- Oh my buddy my pal,
I missed you so much,

257
00:10:43,682 --> 00:10:45,193
how was your nap in the car?

258
00:10:45,193 --> 00:10:46,026
- Good.

259
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:47,554
- Good, did you sleep good?

260
00:10:47,554 --> 00:10:49,785
I missed you so so so much.

261
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:54,320
Did you jump from the
treehouse to the trampoline?

262
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,194
Was it scary?

263
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:57,847
Was it fun?

264
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:00,400
Oh my gosh, like that's so crazy.

265
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,696
- I was a little hesitant.

266
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,375
Well at first I was
like, I don't think so,

267
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,208
you should've seen his face,

268
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,208
he was like I can do it.

269
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,112
- Can you do it?

270
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:10,664
Yeah you did it.

271
00:11:10,664 --> 00:11:14,751
What a brave kid, 'cause
you're Spiderman, huh.

272
00:11:14,751 --> 00:11:16,384
Spiderman's a little tired still.

273
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,048
Give me a kiss, I missed you.

274
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:22,621
Mwaa, and as for you Mr.
Man, hey, I missed you too.

275
00:11:22,621 --> 00:11:23,954
Did you miss me?

276
00:11:25,213 --> 00:11:26,717
Did you miss me?

277
00:11:26,717 --> 00:11:28,557
Oh you missed the chocolate
covered strawberry.

278
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:31,590
I understand, those are delicious.

279
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,423
- Mama.

280
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:33,662
- What?

281
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:35,657
- When is Dad home?

282
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,369
- Dad's home.

283
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:39,285
He's walking Penny.

284
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,834
- Oh.

285
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:44,417
- Okay, two more bites
and we'll go to bed.

286
00:11:48,696 --> 00:11:50,473
Oh don't hit, don't hit.

287
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:52,131
Okay, eat your food up.

288
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:54,067
Eat your food up.

289
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:55,816
Aw you hurt your leg?

290
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:58,066
(laughing)

291
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,270
Oop, ahh, beep,

00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:04,108

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,143

ready, ready?

295
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:13,875
What's that?

296
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,792
Beep, beep,

00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:17,807

Boop, wonk wonk wonk.

302
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,692
Show me how you're soft.

303
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:32,692
Show me how you're soft.

304
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:35,184
Soft.

305
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:38,532
Did you have a good day?

306
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:39,365
You did?

307
00:12:40,884 --> 00:12:42,301
- I need the hat.

308
00:12:44,034 --> 00:12:45,034
Hit my head.

309
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:47,845
- You hit your head.

310
00:12:47,845 --> 00:12:48,678
- Yeah.

311
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:49,511
- Who did?

312
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:53,294
- Owie.

313
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:55,409
- Yeah, that was from the other day.

314
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,080
Okay, just a few more
bites, and then you're done

315
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,913
- Ahh.

316
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,564
- [Jared] Yeah, get 'em good.

317
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:02,513
Scrub 'em real deep,

318
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:03,596
but uh sorry.

319
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,264
- I'm washing my face,

320
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:07,439
get out of here.
- I'm sorry.

321
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:09,501
- [Jared] Oh Ellie, don't

322
00:13:09,501 --> 00:13:10,544
It's been a hard day.

323
00:13:10,544 --> 00:13:11,983
- The kids were so bad, I cried about it.

324
00:13:11,983 --> 00:13:14,087
- [Jared] Let me wipe those tears away.

325
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,422
You should get some waterproof mascara,

326
00:13:15,422 --> 00:13:16,731
that'll solve everything.

327
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:17,674
- Yeah but then it'll rip my eyelashes off

328
00:13:17,674 --> 00:13:19,114
if I ever try to get it off.

329
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,608
- Oh you don't want ripped
eyelashes, that's the worst.

330
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:23,201
You want eyelashes like me.

331
00:13:23,201 --> 00:13:26,961
My dad is playing at a pumpkin walk.

332
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:29,419
So he's playing music,

333
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:30,861
I'm gonna go help him set up his audio

334
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:32,660
and listen to him, 'cause
there's a ton of people

335
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,493
out there at this pumpkin walk

336
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,182
where they have this
beautiful pumpkin display,

337
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,437
so I'm gonna go help him out.

338
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:38,025
You keep washing your face

339
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,866
and I'll see you in an hour or two.

340
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:41,378
- Just getting all the eye boogies out.

341
00:13:41,378 --> 00:13:43,338
- Gotta get those eye boogies.

342
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:44,171
So I've been outside
for about, I don't know,

343
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:45,372
five minutes and everything

344
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,628
and I'm already freezing.

345
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:48,345
I'm not sure how you're music Dad,

346
00:13:48,345 --> 00:13:49,776
with your fingers on the guitar.

347
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:52,354
- It is gonna be cold, it's gonna be cold.

348
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:55,305
- So dad has me helping
him set up his master plan.

349
00:13:55,305 --> 00:13:57,239
If you can't tell, that's
all of his equipment,

350
00:13:57,239 --> 00:13:58,895
and we have to figure out the way

351
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,316
to get it on the stage.

352
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:03,860
I don't want to do a
jigsaw puzzle tonight,

353
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,937
this is crazy.

354
00:14:04,937 --> 00:14:07,528
♫ She yelled said I'm doing fine

355
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:11,695
♫ Don't you let me catch you
staying alone any old day

356
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:17,456
♫ Papa's got a ticket on the mule express

357
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:20,067
Well I'm home and my hands
aren't freezing anymore.

358
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,843
Thank you so much for watching Faith,

359
00:14:21,843 --> 00:14:22,898
have a wonderful day today guys

360
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:24,998
and we will see you next time.

361
00:14:24,998 --> 00:14:25,910
Thanks again for watching.

362
00:14:25,910 --> 00:00:00,000
I appreciate you, bye
