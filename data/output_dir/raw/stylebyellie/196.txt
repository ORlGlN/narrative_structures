1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:02,234
- Sometimes you just have so much fun

2
00:00:02,234 --> 00:00:04,984
in a day or a week that you just pass out

3
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:08,353
and take a nap whenever you are.

4
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:09,909
His arm is up in the air.

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:10,844
That's so cute.

6
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:13,261
Oh, shh, quiet, quiet, quiet.

7
00:00:14,373 --> 00:00:16,236
How cute is he?

8
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:17,660
Goodnight.

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,410
(cheerful music)

10
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:27,309
Good morning family.

11
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:28,557
- At the aquarium.

12
00:00:28,557 --> 00:00:31,153
- We are at the aquarium
that is exactly right.

13
00:00:31,153 --> 00:00:32,107
And guess what?

14
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:34,092
There's like no one here.

15
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:36,292
Do you guys remember how filled that was?

16
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:37,125
- [Ellie] Did you show that?

17
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,464
- [Jared] Yeah, it was so busy.

18
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,276
And the parking lot is completely empty

19
00:00:41,276 --> 00:00:42,762
and we're gonna have a blast.

20
00:00:42,762 --> 00:00:46,038
- There is gonna be a big fish in there.

21
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:47,815
Is there gonna be a big fish?

22
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,801
- [Jared] I think so.

23
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:51,425
- Jackson does not like
when we hold his hand.

24
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:53,464
For crossing the street or something.

25
00:00:53,464 --> 00:00:55,271
I think it's 'cause he
wants his own independence.

26
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:56,868
And he's like, "No, I'll stand by you

27
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:58,244
"but I don't wanna hold your hand."

28
00:00:58,244 --> 00:00:59,977
But he's really good
to hold Calvin's hand.

29
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,967
So sometimes we do it this way.

30
00:01:01,967 --> 00:01:04,244
That way we're all together.

31
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:06,878
- Because this is the aquarium.

32
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:09,462
- [Ellie] That's how I
feel on Mondays too, buddy.

33
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:12,212
That's how I feel on Mondays too.

34
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:16,338
- Ah, ah, he's got my hand, Jackson.

35
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:17,954
Help me, he's got my hand.

36
00:01:17,954 --> 00:01:18,988
Ah, he's got it.

37
00:01:18,988 --> 00:01:19,821
Thank you.

38
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:20,654
(loud thumping)

39
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:21,563
- [Ellie] Oh!

40
00:01:21,563 --> 00:01:22,396
- Oh geez.

41
00:01:23,351 --> 00:01:24,184
Are you okay?

42
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,484
- Yeah.

43
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:28,301
- Thanks for protecting me, Jackson?

44
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,426
Thanks for protecting me.

45
00:01:29,426 --> 00:01:30,878
- [Ellie] Is your hand okay?

46
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,511
Are you okay?

47
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,344
You know what?

48
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,226
You deserve some candy.

49
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:35,949
When we're done, we'll get
a treat at the gift shop.

50
00:01:35,949 --> 00:01:37,148
- He just saved his dad.

51
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,274
- [Ellie] Did you see that?

52
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:39,720
- And maybe bump into these teeth.

53
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,755
- [Ellie] Oh heavens no.

54
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:42,237
- [Jared] No, this is hard as a rock.

55
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:44,048
- That was funny.

56
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:46,752
Wowzers, that escalated quickly.

57
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:50,517
So, we just walked into
this part of the aquarium

58
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:52,955
and it is beautiful.

59
00:01:52,955 --> 00:01:55,538
And they have a ton of turtles.

60
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,013
Look at all of these cuties.

61
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:01,957
Holy moly guacamole.

62
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,108
Hi.

63
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:08,756
So we are in this room
where there are sea turtles

64
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:11,792
and this is a rehabilitation room

65
00:02:11,792 --> 00:02:14,668
so they are helping these turtles.

66
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:17,251
And this one got hit by a boat.

67
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:22,341
And it tells you the name
of it and what happened.

68
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,198
And you can see his shell.

69
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:29,373
And she's just talking us about them.

70
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:31,790
(soft music)

71
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,355
Okay, our cousin came to play with us.

72
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:39,772
Everyone's grabbing a turtle.

73
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:01,795
- [Jared] Okay guys, bring
your turtles into recovery.

74
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:03,795
Yup, right in there.

75
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,962
Now real soft.

76
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:10,509
Good job.

77
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:12,737
Okay, put them in the water.

78
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:14,102
Nice.

79
00:03:14,102 --> 00:03:16,277
Go ahead, Maggie.

80
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:17,110
Good.

81
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,764
Okay, it's time to release the turtles.

82
00:03:26,764 --> 00:03:28,407
- I'm gonna do it again.

83
00:03:28,407 --> 00:03:29,580
- [Jared] There you go, good job.

84
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,538
You just saved a turtle's life, Jackson.

85
00:03:31,538 --> 00:03:33,923
- I'm gonna do it again.

86
00:03:33,923 --> 00:03:35,304
- [Calvin] I'll get them.

87
00:03:35,304 --> 00:03:36,876
Look.

88
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:39,395
- [Jared] Do you see all those fish?

89
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,890
Is that so cool, Bud?

90
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:43,640
Are you counting 'em?

91
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,785
Look at how big this is.

92
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,211
- [Woman] This kind of crap blows my mind.

93
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,559
- Oh yeah.
- Totally.

94
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,852
Look at this.

95
00:03:51,852 --> 00:03:53,213
- [Jared] Look, there's a shark.

96
00:03:53,213 --> 00:03:55,247
- [Woman] That looks like a cartoon.

97
00:03:55,247 --> 00:03:56,414
- [Jared] Wow!

98
00:03:58,362 --> 00:03:59,662
What do you guys think of this?

99
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:02,169
- Look at that big shark.

100
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:04,907
- [Jared] That is so big.

101
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:06,715
They're so big.

102
00:04:06,715 --> 00:04:10,346
Look how mean this one looks, Ellie.

103
00:04:10,346 --> 00:04:11,365
Look at that one right there.

104
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:12,901
- [Ellie] Oh yeah, that one looks angry.

105
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,962
- [Jared] He looks so mean.

106
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:18,312
- [Ellie] Where's the scary guy?

107
00:04:18,312 --> 00:04:20,226
(laughs)

108
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:23,457
Okay, I think we all had fun.

109
00:04:23,457 --> 00:04:27,042
Ending it with trying to find shark teeth.

110
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:30,674
- It is our last day at the
beach and it is chilly outside.

111
00:04:30,674 --> 00:04:31,875
But we're doing our best

112
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:33,783
to make the most of it, have some fun.

113
00:04:33,783 --> 00:04:37,801
So we're gonna dig some holes
and put kids inside of them.

114
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:38,682
- Bury the children.

115
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:40,365
- [Jared] Bury the children.

116
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,198
Jump in!

117
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:45,432
Okay, bend down a little bit.

118
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,265
Bend down.

119
00:04:46,265 --> 00:04:47,098
Okay, not that low.

120
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:50,705
There ya go, now we're gonna fill it in.

121
00:04:50,705 --> 00:04:51,538
Stay there.

122
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:52,461
Bend down a little more.

123
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:55,961
Okay, now we're gonna put your arms under.

124
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:00,703
- [Man] Where did your body go?

125
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:01,959
Oh no.

126
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,320
- [Jared] Hey Jackson.

127
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,955
You're stuck in the sand.

128
00:05:04,955 --> 00:05:06,751
You're totally trapped.

129
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:08,273
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, Jackson.

130
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,106
Time to get out.

131
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:10,963
Wiggle yourself out.

132
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,130
Dig, dig, dig.

133
00:05:13,415 --> 00:05:14,981
(laughs)

134
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,314
Yeah, he's free!

135
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,394
Yeah!

136
00:05:21,512 --> 00:05:23,971
- [Ellie] All right you beach boys.

137
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,974
- We got our big body boards.

138
00:05:25,974 --> 00:05:27,241
- [Ellie] Take your big body boards

139
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:28,703
and see how well you do.

140
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,374
- Yeah, surfer.

141
00:05:30,374 --> 00:05:32,918
Whatever, boogie board.

142
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,501
(upbeat music)

143
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:53,718
- Oh Calvin.

144
00:05:58,547 --> 00:05:59,380
Calvin.

145
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,130
He has taken his shorts off two times

146
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,696
and once down on the beach
yelling, "Bum, bum, bum, bum."

147
00:06:06,696 --> 00:06:07,817
No!

148
00:06:07,817 --> 00:06:09,229
That's gonna hurt.

149
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:10,170
- Okay get this.

150
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,850
Believe it or not, Ellie is with my sister

151
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,201
and brother-in-law and
they are at CrossFit.

152
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:18,425
My sister and brother-in-law
have been doing CrossFit

153
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,408
for awhile now and you guys
know that we've been trying

154
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:21,904
to work out and be better.

155
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:22,781
So Ellie went with them.

156
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:23,963
She's like, "You guys
have been going all week.

157
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,485
"I wanna go with you
and get my workout in."

158
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,381
So she went with them.

159
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:29,826
I stayed back because I
actually have a phone call,

160
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:33,305
a meeting that I have
to go to, be a part of,

161
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:36,175
in like one minute at three o'clock.

162
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:37,434
And it's three o'clock right now.

163
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,069
So I just thought that was worth noting

164
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,200
that Ellie is at CrossFit.

165
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,282
I know the internet has a different...

166
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:44,850
There's a stigma with CrossFit sometimes

167
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,633
but we're bettering our bodies.

168
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,683
And that's the goal, sometimes.

169
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,562
We're trying to do that
sometimes, I guess.

170
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:53,145
(upbeat music)

171
00:07:00,276 --> 00:07:02,658
- So I just tried out CrossFit today

172
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:06,785
but I am balancing it out with a muffin.

173
00:07:06,785 --> 00:07:09,047
- When I was talking
about the clip before,

174
00:07:09,047 --> 00:07:10,747
I was like sometimes.

175
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:13,730
We're doing good balancing
everything sometimes.

176
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,563
- Oh yeah.

177
00:07:14,563 --> 00:07:15,396
- [Jared] This is the sometimes.

178
00:07:15,396 --> 00:07:16,229
- Oh yeah, it's a balance.

179
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:18,241
I workout and now I'm eating a muffin.

180
00:07:18,241 --> 00:07:19,074
It was really fun.

181
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,642
I never done CrossFit.

182
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,837
Melanie over there, hi.

183
00:07:22,837 --> 00:07:25,697
Melanie and her husband, they
do CrossFit all the time.

184
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:28,106
So Jenn and I went with them and did it.

185
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:30,258
And I worked out and it was awesome.

186
00:07:30,258 --> 00:07:31,091
- Did you like it?

187
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:33,622
- Yeah, I didn't push myself though

188
00:07:33,622 --> 00:07:35,570
'cause I didn't wanna be sick, you know?

189
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:37,561
- You wanted to get a good feel for it

190
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:40,704
and kinda see because we're
looking at different workouts.

191
00:07:40,704 --> 00:07:44,175
We did the phone workout,
we did the Apple TV workout,

192
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:45,308
and we've gone to a couple gyms.

193
00:07:45,308 --> 00:07:46,373
And now we're just trying CrossFit.

194
00:07:46,373 --> 00:07:48,723
- I like doing it home 'cause
it's hard to leave your kids.

195
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:50,279
Anyway, but it was fun.

196
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,368
And I'm gonna finish my muffin.

197
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:53,285
- Hi Buddy.

198
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,077
Hi Buddy.

199
00:07:56,484 --> 00:07:57,317
Oh, Ellie!

200
00:07:58,332 --> 00:07:59,165
I miss...

201
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:02,692
The baby smell.

202
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:05,800
- I guess I haven't smelled
your cheeks, baby boy.

203
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,868
- Smell his head.

204
00:08:06,868 --> 00:08:07,701
- You do.

205
00:08:08,643 --> 00:08:09,586
- Do you miss that?

206
00:08:09,586 --> 00:08:12,326
- Look at face, "Please stop smelling me."

207
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,293
- I just miss that so much.

208
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,779
That's one of the things that is so unique

209
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,717
is just that fresh baby smell.

210
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:20,693
You smell good little baby boy.

211
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:21,875
Yes, you do.

212
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:22,875
Yes, you do.

213
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,541
- Hi.

214
00:08:27,532 --> 00:08:28,365
Hi.

215
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:31,239
(clicking)

216
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,748
- Ooh, he liked that.

217
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:33,581
Huh?

218
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:34,905
Yeah.

219
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:37,136
He's looking at my hair, look at that.

220
00:08:37,136 --> 00:08:40,047
Peter you looking at my hair?

221
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:43,240
Oh my gosh, would you look at that spider?

222
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,556
That is so big.

223
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:48,218
That's probably three inches
long, four inches long.

224
00:08:48,218 --> 00:08:50,423
- [Ellie] So creeped out.

225
00:08:50,423 --> 00:08:52,466
- It's very windy out here.

226
00:08:52,466 --> 00:08:56,134
So we all got kites to
fly kites in the wind.

227
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,318
You probably can't hear
anything we're saying.

228
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:58,234
- It's kinda scary

229
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,165
with all these streamers
blowing everywhere.

230
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,150
Come here.

231
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,333
- Let's fly a kite, Jackson.

232
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,876
- Jackson, Calvin!

233
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,954
- Calvin, come on, let's fly a kite.

234
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:08,537
(upbeat music)

235
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:07,929
Sometimes you just have so
much fun in a day or a week

236
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:12,562
that you just pass out and
take a nap whenever you are.

237
00:10:12,562 --> 00:10:14,140
His arm is up in the air.

238
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,973
That's so cute.

239
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,390
Oh, shh, quiet, quiet, quiet.

240
00:10:18,543 --> 00:10:20,459
How cute is he?

241
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:21,910
Goodnight.

242
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,493
(upbeat music)

243
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,760
To end our party, we are
having a glow stick party.

244
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,398
Everyone is upstairs
getting the glow sticks

245
00:10:36,398 --> 00:10:38,293
that they want ready to go

246
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,797
and they're coming out here
to a pool and a hot tub.

247
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,630
Holy crap.

248
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,625
Oh my gosh, it's so windy and cold.

249
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,165
Oh my gosh, I have a
feeling everyone is going

250
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:48,491
to be in the hot tub.

251
00:10:48,491 --> 00:10:49,324
Just like Ellie is.

252
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:51,511
Show me your glow stick.

253
00:10:51,511 --> 00:10:54,094
(upbeat music)

254
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,898
Woo!

255
00:11:06,898 --> 00:11:07,803
This is gonna be extra cold

256
00:11:07,803 --> 00:11:10,499
because I just got out of the hot tub.

257
00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:12,578
(screams)

258
00:11:12,578 --> 00:11:15,161
(upbeat music)

259
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,425
Can you believe our trip is over?

260
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:47,258
- Yes.

261
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:49,390
- This is our last night here.

262
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:50,486
- We had so much fun.

263
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:52,332
- It was seriously a
blast every single day.

264
00:11:52,332 --> 00:11:53,599
Every single night we went to bed

265
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:54,951
we were just completely exhausted

266
00:11:54,951 --> 00:11:57,604
because of the day's
activities were so awesome.

267
00:11:57,604 --> 00:12:01,485
- And we have 1,001 seashells
that we are bringing home.

268
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,141
- Literally like 15 cups.

269
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,581
- Jared said just save the ones.

270
00:12:04,581 --> 00:12:05,414
- Just pick the best.

271
00:12:05,414 --> 00:12:06,247
- And I said, no!

272
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,031
Jackson collected 90% of them.

273
00:12:09,031 --> 00:12:11,347
- And also we're giving a
lot of them to Grandma Great

274
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:12,323
'cause she asked for them.
- Yeah.

275
00:12:12,323 --> 00:12:13,156
- So we're going that.

276
00:12:13,156 --> 00:12:14,676
But thank you guys for
watching for the video.

277
00:12:14,676 --> 00:12:19,032
We have a long, long day
tomorrow of flying and traveling.

278
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:21,212
So thank you guys.

279
00:12:21,212 --> 00:12:22,784
We will see you guys tomorrow.

280
00:12:22,784 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Both] Bye.
