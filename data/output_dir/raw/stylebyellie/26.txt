1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,127
- So this has never happened to me before

2
00:00:01,127 --> 00:00:03,151
in my whole entire life as a parent.

3
00:00:03,151 --> 00:00:04,980
(grunts) Oh! Oh!

4
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,854
Yeah, woo! (laughs)

5
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:11,660
Yay!

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,560
Good job.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,717
Good morning, guys!

8
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:16,692
How are you?

9
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:17,525
- [Jackson] Good.

10
00:00:17,525 --> 00:00:18,358
Good?

11
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,300
Hey, who has the craziest hair here today?

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,133
- [Jackson] Calvin.

13
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:22,966
- Calvin does?

14
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:24,745
Is your hair crazy, or
is Daddy's hair crazy?

15
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:26,521
Or is Jackson's hair crazy?

16
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:28,750
(laughs)

17
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:29,583
Hey, guess what.

18
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,240
So, Mommy went to the doctor today,

19
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,865
and they cut her toe!

20
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:34,870
- [Jackson] Aww.

21
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:37,240
- Yeah, so her toe is
probably going to get hurt.

22
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,469
She had what's called an ingrown toenail.

23
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,955
- [Doctor] And you might feel
this, so tell me if you do.

24
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,836
- [Ellie] Yeah, a little.

25
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:45,310
- [Doctor] I'll try to make it so you only

26
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,340
feel the first one.

27
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,970
- [Ellie] 'Kay, that would be nice.

28
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,790
I mean, I've had babies, so it's okay.

29
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,890
But stuff like this still,
whoa, really sucks. (groans)

30
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,540
- And the doctors fixed it today,

31
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,530
so she might be in a little bit of pain

32
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,400
when she gets home from the doctor today.

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,682
- [Jackson] Okay.
- So when she gets home,

34
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:03,730
let's be so nice to Mom.

35
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,730
Let's make sure she has
everything she needs,

36
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,487
and make her extra comfortable.

37
00:01:07,487 --> 00:01:08,570
Can we do that?

38
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,403
- Yeah.

39
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:10,236
- Can we be a good team?

40
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,069
- [Jackson] Yeah.
- [Calvin] Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:12,010
- Good, that's my boys!

42
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,223
Look at this, we're a team of boys,

43
00:01:13,223 --> 00:01:15,221
and we're gonna add one to the squad.

44
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,310
We're gonna be the boy squad.

45
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,460
Teen boy squad!

46
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,617
That's like a Homestar Runner,

47
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:22,760
that didn't really work all that great.

48
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,030
If you guys know Homestar Runner,

49
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,370
then you know the Teen Girl Squad,

50
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,486
but this is not a girl
squad, this is a guy squad.

51
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:31,795
So, anyway! (laughs)

52
00:01:31,795 --> 00:01:33,911
Let's be nice to Mommy today, okay, boys?

53
00:01:33,911 --> 00:01:34,744
- [Both] 'Kay.

54
00:01:34,744 --> 00:01:35,758
- 'Kay, I love you.

55
00:01:35,758 --> 00:01:37,280
- [Jackson] I love you.

56
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,723
- I love you!

57
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,056
(all laugh)

58
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:44,330
(kisses)

59
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,335
So this has never happened to me before

60
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,340
in my whole entire life as a parent.

61
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,173
What are you doing?

62
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:49,172
Are you pushing me?

63
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:50,140
- Yeah.

64
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,367
- [Jared] Yeah, why are you pushing me?

65
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:52,794
- Um, foot.

66
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:53,718
- [Jared] Your foot?

67
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:54,870
- No, your foot.

68
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,910
- He's pushing my feet.

69
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,875
He pushed me from my
office, where I was working,

70
00:01:58,875 --> 00:02:01,790
all the way downstairs to grab this

71
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,863
so you could have more what?

72
00:02:03,863 --> 00:02:05,130
- Up the stair.

73
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,823
- [Jared] Up the stairs to
get chocolate milk, huh?

74
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:07,660
- [Calvin] Mm-hmm.

75
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,389
- He grabbed me and pushed me,

76
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,500
he's like, "Dad, follow me, I
need you to do this for me."

77
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,146
It was the sweetest, kind of the most

78
00:02:14,146 --> 00:02:15,979
interesting thing, ever.

79
00:02:15,979 --> 00:02:16,812
(laughs)

80
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,012
Hey, is this what you want?

81
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,845
- Yeah.

82
00:02:18,845 --> 00:02:20,770
- [Jared] Okay, where do you want it?

83
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:21,603
In your cup?

84
00:02:21,603 --> 00:02:22,470
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,120
- [Jared] Okay. Okay, you hold it.

86
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,492
Good job. Do you wanna pour it?

87
00:02:25,492 --> 00:02:26,325
- Uh huh.

88
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:27,158
- Okay.

89
00:02:27,158 --> 00:02:29,100
Let's be so careful, and I'll help you

90
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,810
pour it into here, okay?
- 'Kay.

91
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,103
- Go slow, slow, good job!

92
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,320
Good job, Calvin, you did it!

93
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,360
- It big!

94
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,940
- Yeah, it's big chocolate milk!

95
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,320
You got a lot, huh.

96
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,440
That was great work!

97
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,200
Daddy helped you, but you did good, huh?

98
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,129
- They cut my toenail.

99
00:02:45,129 --> 00:02:48,133
They fixed it, so it's gonna
be like this for a little bit.

100
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:49,831
Will you guys be able to take care of me?

101
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:51,300
- [Jackson, Calvin] Yeah.

102
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,466
- You will?

103
00:02:52,466 --> 00:02:53,699
You'll take care of me?
- [Jackson] What is this one

104
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:54,532
right here?

105
00:02:54,532 --> 00:02:55,747
- [Ellie] So Calvin, if
I need chocolate milk,

106
00:02:55,747 --> 00:02:57,163
will you go get me some?

107
00:02:57,163 --> 00:02:57,996
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:02:57,996 --> 00:02:58,880
- [Ellie] Okay.

109
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,386
- [Jared] Does it look like
Mommy has a really big toe?

110
00:03:00,386 --> 00:03:01,219
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,280
- [Jared] Yeah.

112
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,597
- [Ellie] You can touch
it, you gotta just be soft.

113
00:03:03,597 --> 00:03:04,430
- [Jared] So soft.

114
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,345
Did it hurt?

115
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:10,070
- [Ellie] No, um, a lot,
don't squeeze. (chuckles)

116
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,350
You're being a little kid!

117
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,580
A lot of people were like,
"It's gonna hurt super bad

118
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,070
"when you get it numbed,"
like, that's the worst part.

119
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,180
It wasn't bad, like, he
did a really good job.

120
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,087
He's like, "The slower
I go, it won't hurt."

121
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,325
It was the initial
poke, I was like, "Ahh!"

122
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:27,040
But it wasn't, it really
didn't hurt that bad.

123
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,873
- [Jared] That's good.

124
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,320
- [Ellie] But she said
the numbness wears off,

125
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,153
I'll be hurting.

126
00:03:30,153 --> 00:03:32,790
- Oh yeah. Was it my dad who
just recently had this done?

127
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,750
He was like, "Oh yeah, it was
the worst pain in the world."

128
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,773
So either you're really
tough, or my dad's a wuss.

129
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:38,978
I think my dad's a wuss. (laughs)

130
00:03:38,978 --> 00:03:41,391
- [Ellie] Um, so yeah, I just
need to be careful with it.

131
00:03:41,391 --> 00:03:42,330
- [Jared] Yeah.

132
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,730
Oh, well I'm sorry that this
is gonna have to be like this.

133
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,995
How long do you have
to keep the bandage on?

134
00:03:46,995 --> 00:03:48,240
- [Ellie] 'Til tomorrow night.

135
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,250
- [Jared] Oh, that's not too bad.

136
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,620
- And then just be
careful for a few weeks.

137
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,545
Here Jackson, give me a hug.

138
00:03:52,545 --> 00:03:53,680
I love you!

139
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:55,953
Are you guys gonna help me?

140
00:03:55,953 --> 00:03:57,409
Do you got an ow?

141
00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:00,600
(Calvin babbles)

142
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,742
You just want the extra attention, too!

143
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:03,730
(Ellie and Jared laugh)

144
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,076
- [Jared] 'Kay, let's be
extra good to Mommy today

145
00:04:05,076 --> 00:04:07,200
and get whatever she needs, all right?

146
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,092
We should get her food?

147
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:08,925
- Yeah.

148
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:09,940
- [Jared] That's a great idea, Jackson!

149
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,773
Mom, what would you like?

150
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:12,378
- Um, we should make another meal.

151
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,490
- [Jared] That sounds great.

152
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,939
'Kay, let's get to it.

153
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,810
- [Ellie] The entertainment
that the kids are giving us.

154
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,418
(laughs) They have done this 100 times.

155
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:25,140
I'm just sitting here, with my foot up.

156
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,650
You guys are crazy.

157
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,000
- Oh, Ellie!

158
00:04:31,109 --> 00:04:34,367
I've got another surprise for you!

159
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:35,609
- [Ellie] Is it nail polish?

160
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,962
- Do you want me to bring it down?

161
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:37,920
- [Ellie] Sure.

162
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,800
- Okay!

163
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,414
Boy, we are just getting
lucky with timing this week.

164
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,915
First, Hello Fresh could not
have come at a better time,

165
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:46,520
and Ellie just had her
little toe procedure done,

166
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,361
her foot procedure done,
and I think this may be

167
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:51,503
very special to her today.

168
00:04:51,503 --> 00:04:52,496
Let's go give it to her.

169
00:04:52,496 --> 00:04:53,329
- [Ellie] What?

170
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,426
- I've got something behind my back.

171
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:55,819
Jackson, hurry, turn on
the light so Mom can see.

172
00:04:55,819 --> 00:04:57,085
- [Ellie] I think I know what it could be!

173
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:58,535
- [Jared] No, you don't
know, it's a surprise!

174
00:04:58,535 --> 00:04:59,695
Turn on the light.

175
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:01,515
- [Ellie] The once a month
Bump Box that you got me?

176
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:03,281
- No, how'd you know?!

177
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:05,394
- [Ellie] I saw the transaction
come out of the bank.

178
00:05:05,394 --> 00:05:06,984
- [Jared] Oh! (laughs)

179
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:07,817
- Jared!

180
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:09,990
- [Jared] Let's open it,
let's see what's inside!

181
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,106
Oh, do you need a pocket knife?

182
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:11,939
- Yeah.

183
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:13,220
- [Jared] You better believe
I have a pocket knife

184
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,053
in my pocket.

185
00:05:14,053 --> 00:05:17,270
- I'll do this, and then you can open it.

186
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,152
This was such a nice thing, Jared.

187
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,130
Daddy get this for Mom?

188
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:23,361
What is it?

189
00:05:23,361 --> 00:05:25,130
- [Jared] What?

190
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,090
Look at all that.

191
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,307
- I got chipotle green chips.

192
00:05:28,307 --> 00:05:29,140
- [Jared] Yum.

193
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,747
- I got a Bella B Glowing
Skin Lightening Cream.

194
00:05:32,747 --> 00:05:34,131
- [Jared] Yeah.

195
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:37,400
- Prevention of fading, pregnancy mask.

196
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,330
Polished to perfection?

197
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,187
- [Jared] Yeah, you get
that perfection, girl!

198
00:05:41,187 --> 00:05:43,590
- Anti-blemish facial
wash, what do they think,

199
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,343
when you get pregnant, you get acne?

200
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,689
You do! (laughs)

201
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:47,522
Do you?

202
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:48,591
- [Jared] Jen, have you been getting acne?

203
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,929
- Uh, not as much as I did with my boys.

204
00:05:50,929 --> 00:05:52,840
- [Jared] Oh, yeah.
- [Ellie] What?!

205
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,790
- But yes, I do.

206
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,168
- Bath soak, lavender,
organic frankincense.

207
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:59,086
- [Jared] Yum.
- Oh, frankincense.

208
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:01,337
- [Jared] Jesus got
frankincense when he was born.

209
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:02,420
- [Jennifer] He sure did.

210
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,253
- [Jared] Yeah.

211
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:04,930
- Energy body lotion.

212
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,973
- [Jared] Wow!

213
00:06:07,901 --> 00:06:08,960
- Mom, she got this.

214
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,793
- What's this?

215
00:06:09,793 --> 00:06:10,633
- [Jared] That looks like it's cool.

216
00:06:10,633 --> 00:06:11,538
- [Jackson] It's a picture.

217
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,883
- [Jared] Oh, it's a
frame for an ultrasound.

218
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:14,147
- Is that where we should
put the baby's picture?

219
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,070
- [Jackson] Yeah.

220
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,903
- [Jared] That's cool.

221
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:17,980
What a fun box.
- Jared!

222
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,260
- [Jared] Happy Bump Box day.

223
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,483
- Jared did this, I didn't even,
he did this all on his own.

224
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,684
You're so cute to me.

225
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,379
- Well, I just love you very, very much.

226
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:27,525
- And then I asked him, I was
like, "Was this sponsored?

227
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:28,491
Did you get this?"

228
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,890
It wasn't.
- [Jared] No, it wasn't.

229
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,595
It's not, it's just fun.
- You're cute.

230
00:06:31,595 --> 00:06:33,644
- It's fun to get little surprises

231
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,457
when you completely forget about them.

232
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:36,910
- Yay, confetti!

233
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,740
- [Jared] Confetti, throw
it up in the air, Jackson!

234
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,890
Yay!

235
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,960
Hey, it's a good thing we can use

236
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,467
one of three vacuums to get that. (laughs)

237
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:44,907
- We're gonna vacuum! (laughs)

238
00:06:44,907 --> 00:06:46,940
- [Jackson] Wow!

239
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,529
- [Jared] Come on, Nixon,
you join in the fun!

240
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:52,140
He's like, oh it's very, very messy.

241
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,320
Maybe one of these nights
before Jennifer goes home,

242
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,010
you could use one of those masks.

243
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,790
Is there a mask in there
or something like that?

244
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:58,623
- [Jennifer] That would be fun.

245
00:06:58,623 --> 00:07:00,002
- [Jared] You girls
can, like, I don't know.

246
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,553
- I heard the word mask, but I don't--

247
00:07:01,553 --> 00:07:02,860
- We could do a bubble bath together.

248
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:03,840
- [Jared] There you go.

249
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,773
You can, like, you and Bonnie, and watch

250
00:07:05,773 --> 00:07:08,760
The Bachelor Winter Olympics,
'cause there's someone

251
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,374
from Finland on there, is what I heard.

252
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:11,870
- Yeah, they're beautiful.

253
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,130
- Yeah, so that's gonna be fun.

254
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,096
You kids play with your
confetti for a minute,

255
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,540
and then we'll vacuum it up.

256
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,639
Boys, guess what!

257
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,472
- What?

258
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,016
- [Jared] The girls have gone out.

259
00:07:21,016 --> 00:07:22,236
And you know what that means?

260
00:07:22,236 --> 00:07:23,069
- Yeah.

261
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:24,975
- It's the boy's time to party!

262
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:28,310
We're gonna party, we're gonna party!

263
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,143
Show me how you party.

264
00:07:29,143 --> 00:07:32,530
Yeah, woo! (laughs)

265
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,180
The girls are gone, what
do you guys wanna do?

266
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,671
Calvin's asleep, pshh!
Can you believe that?

267
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:38,757
What do you guys wanna do?

268
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:39,590
- Play!

269
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,423
- [Jared] You wanna play?

270
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:42,508
- No, I wanna go outside in the front.

271
00:07:42,508 --> 00:07:44,560
- [Jared] Well, I don't think
Cannon has his snow clothes,

272
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,645
so maybe we should go downstairs and play!

273
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:48,478
- Yes!

274
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:49,603
- [Jared] Yeah!

275
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,399
- Yeah!

276
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,510
- Yes!

277
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,343
- [Jared] All right, let's
go, let's go downstairs

278
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:56,091
and we'll play, this is
gonna be so much fun,

279
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,912
playing with our cousins,
having a great time

280
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:01,630
while the girls do boring
stuff like shopping,

281
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,660
can you believe that?

282
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,210
- Yeah, even I wanna play
a game with you and Cannon.

283
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,180
- Let's do it!

284
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,240
Jackson, where's that football?

285
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,073
Let's play football!

286
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,818
We can pass it around to each other.

287
00:08:09,818 --> 00:08:11,240
- I can't find it.

288
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,230
- [Jared] Let's go look for it.

289
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,083
Oh, there's so many cars, look
at all these Hot Wheel cars.

290
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,325
It's almost like Godzilla went
through and rampaged here.

291
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:18,568
You found it, good job!

292
00:08:18,568 --> 00:08:20,190
Let's throw it to each other.

293
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,460
Oh, got it! Nice.

294
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,990
Cannon, are you the firefighter
for the day, or the farmer?

295
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:26,160
- A firefighter.

296
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,452
- [Jared] Firefighter? Yeah.

297
00:08:27,452 --> 00:08:30,685
(grunts) Oh, got it, yes!

298
00:08:30,685 --> 00:08:34,559
(grunts) Oh, you got
me right in the tummy!

299
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,897
Oh, it hurts so bad,
oh, right in the tummy!

300
00:08:38,898 --> 00:08:42,530
Hey, good catch, bud, you did it!

301
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,562
High five! High five!

302
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:47,697
Hey, nice catch!

303
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,026
- Nice catch!

304
00:08:49,026 --> 00:08:50,002
- [Jared] (laughs)

305
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,130
Oh, oh, what a line drive.

306
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,510
Oh my goodness, it's a
masterpiece, it's a masterpiece!

307
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,371
This night is about to
get 10 times better.

308
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,450
It's pizza night!

309
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:03,470
Who's having a good time today?!

310
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,762
Yay!

311
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:08,920
It's pizza night, and every
pizza night is a great,

312
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,809
great night, because pizza's
delicious and I love pizza.

313
00:09:11,809 --> 00:09:13,760
Raise your hand if you love pizza!

314
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,526
Hey, we got a good solid
crowd out here tonight,

315
00:09:17,526 --> 00:09:19,742
thanks for joining us, we're
gonna have a great time,

316
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:20,662
do you like Pizza?

317
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:22,080
- [Jennifer] Raise your
hand if you like pizza.

318
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
- Oh! He's more of a mac
and cheese kind of guy.

319
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,525
- [Jackson] I do, I do!
- [Jared] Yeah, there's our

320
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:28,020
volunteer for the evening.

321
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,686
Don't worry, folks, I'm your
tonight's entertainment,

322
00:09:29,686 --> 00:09:32,700
and I'll be here all evening.

323
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,414
So when we got here, we
noticed that the Smurfs movie

324
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:36,950
was playing on Grandma and
Grandpa's TV, and Jackson,

325
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,628
what did you ask me about the Smurfs?

326
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:40,381
- Why are they wearing socks?

327
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,175
- [Jared] Why are they
wearing socks on their head?

328
00:09:42,175 --> 00:09:43,008
- Yeah.

329
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:44,440
- [Jared] Do you think it's maybe to cover

330
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,606
the toes on their head?

331
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:46,439
- Yeah.

332
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,637
- [Jared] Yeah? (laughs)

333
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:48,508
Is that silly?

334
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:49,790
You think it looks like a hat?

335
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,623
- Uh-huh.

336
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,560
- [Jared] What do you think it
looks like under their hats?

337
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,393
Or their socks?

338
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:54,678
- Underwear.

339
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,273
- [Jared] Underwear? (laughs)

340
00:09:56,273 --> 00:09:59,106
(Jackson singing)

341
00:10:05,424 --> 00:10:07,590
(laughs) That's a good job, bud.

342
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,779
Are you singing Believer?

343
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:09,612
- [Jackson] Yeah.

344
00:10:09,612 --> 00:10:13,380
♪ Make me a, you make me a believer ♪

345
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,213
- [Jared] That was good.

346
00:10:14,213 --> 00:10:16,210
Should we get our pajamas
on, and get a book?

347
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,450
- [Book Speaker] Ka-chow!

348
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,352
- [Jared] Ka-chow is right!

349
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,110
Calvin's loving you so
much, isn't he? (laughs)

350
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,438
- He's scratching me.

351
00:10:23,438 --> 00:10:25,198
- [Jared] Did you guys
have a good day today?

352
00:10:25,198 --> 00:10:26,290
- [Jackson] Yeah.

353
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,350
- [Jared] What was your
favorite part of the day?

354
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,062
- Going to Grandma's house.

355
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,650
- [Jared] Going to Grandma's house.

356
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,221
That was so much fun,
I'm glad you had fun.

357
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:33,598
- Goodnight, friends.

358
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:35,397
- Night, friend!

359
00:10:35,397 --> 00:10:37,934
- We are saying goodnight to
the boys with a classic book,

360
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,332
The Little Blue Truck Halloween.

361
00:10:40,332 --> 00:10:42,456
(gasps) Little Blue
Truck was your favorite

362
00:10:42,456 --> 00:10:44,140
as a little kid, Jackson.

363
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,973
Did you know that?

364
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:46,660
And this Halloween one is fun, too.

365
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,130
So let's read this,
and we'll say goodnight

366
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,281
to our friends again, okay?

367
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,653
- [Calvin] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:10:50,653 --> 00:10:52,151
- [Jared] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

369
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,149
Under the mask, who do you see?

370
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,814
- Quack, it's me, it's me.

371
00:10:56,814 --> 00:11:00,376
- [Jared] Quack, quack, quack,
it's me, it's me. (laughs)

372
00:11:00,376 --> 00:11:01,610
- Oh, he keeps bending them!

373
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,170
- [Jared] Oh, we'll fix it, don't worry.

374
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:04,507
You get to do the next one, 'kay, bud?

375
00:11:04,507 --> 00:11:06,213
Who's this clown with a big red nose

376
00:11:06,213 --> 00:11:09,110
and a cap that jingles wherever he goes?

377
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,110
Under the mask, who do you see?

378
00:11:12,535 --> 00:11:14,686
- [Jackson] Bah says the
sheep, it's me, it's me.

379
00:11:14,686 --> 00:11:17,036
- [Jared] Bah says the
sheep, it's me, it's me!

380
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,886
Your face looks like it's in pain.

381
00:11:19,886 --> 00:11:21,461
How is your body doing?

382
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,614
- Well, first, my stomach's killing me.

383
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:25,147
- Hold on one second.

384
00:11:25,147 --> 00:11:27,700
Hey, Siri, stop the music.

385
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,813
Nice.

386
00:11:30,813 --> 00:11:31,923
What were you saying there, sweetheart?

387
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,000
- So first, my stomach is killing me.

388
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,898
It's funny how there are some things

389
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:37,655
you never have when you're pregnant,

390
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,243
and then the next pregnancy, you're like,

391
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:42,043
I have to have that.

392
00:11:42,043 --> 00:11:43,954
I totally want, like, a belly support.

393
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,424
My stomach, I'm like, it is so heavy.

394
00:11:46,424 --> 00:11:47,298
- [Jared] Yeah.

395
00:11:47,298 --> 00:11:48,870
- [Ellie] And it hurts so bad right now.

396
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,703
- [Jared] It's cute.

397
00:11:49,703 --> 00:11:50,740
You look good pregnant.

398
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,830
How's your toe doing?

399
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:52,790
- [Ellie] It's killing me.

400
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,311
- [Jared] Aw, I'm sorry.

401
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:57,440
- Yeah, this morning, I was
like, "That was awesome."

402
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,273
- [Jared] And now you're like--

403
00:11:58,273 --> 00:11:59,890
- [Ellie] Now I'm like, owie shiz.

404
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,824
It hurts super bad.
- [Jared] I'm sorry.

405
00:12:02,824 --> 00:12:05,672
So when you do this
again for your next toe,

406
00:12:05,672 --> 00:12:07,530
are you gonna do things differently?

407
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,380
- No.

408
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,886
- [Jared] No? You're not
gonna take it any easier

409
00:12:09,886 --> 00:12:11,140
or anything like that?

410
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,640
- I feel like I did.

411
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,849
- [Jared] Yeah, kinda like
kept it elevated and stuff?

412
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:15,830
- Um, yeah.

413
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,850
I was so confused why they
couldn't do both of them.

414
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,420
Like, I was wanting them to just do

415
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,023
both of them today so I could just

416
00:12:21,023 --> 00:12:22,760
be done.
- [Jared] Be done with it?

417
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,570
- And she's like, "No, you're
not gonna want to do that."

418
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,590
I was like, "Okay."

419
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:28,930
- I imagine it's like the dentist,

420
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,952
they don't want to numb both sides,

421
00:12:29,952 --> 00:12:32,590
because then you're numb on
both sides, you don't want to--

422
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,814
- Yeah, 'cause then for two weeks,

423
00:12:33,814 --> 00:12:35,970
it's, she says it's tender for two weeks,

424
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,079
but just, I think, the
next few days is the worst.

425
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:38,912
- [Jared] Yeah.

426
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:40,384
- But, like, I definitely,
like, it's tender.

427
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,930
- [Jared] It looks like
you have a giant toe.

428
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,900
- [Ellie] It looks like
I'm flipping you off.

429
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,373
- [Jared] With your giant toe.

430
00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,206
- Yeah, 'cause I am.

431
00:12:45,206 --> 00:12:47,040
- [Jared] That's, like, super vulgar.

432
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,910
Geez, why are you so rude all the time?

433
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,743
- Jared.

434
00:12:49,743 --> 00:12:50,576
- [Jared] Meh! (laughs)

435
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:52,105
- Do you get what I'm
trying to say right now?

436
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,673
Bend over! (both laugh)

437
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,670
- So guys, I think
that's where we're going

438
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,813
to end the vlog today.

439
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:59,158
And before we do, there's a couple things.

440
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,120
I just wanted to say that we're grateful

441
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,305
for your support now, and especially

442
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:06,380
over the past four and a half years.

443
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,487
This is the first time we've done

444
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,855
something like this, and
it's gonna take some--

445
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:12,260
- [Ellie] Where we've
changed our schedule.

446
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,514
- [Jared] Yeah, it's
gonna take some time--

447
00:13:13,514 --> 00:13:14,510
- We've never done that.

448
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,088
- For us to adjust, just as much as

449
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,816
it's gonna take some time for
you guys to adjust to that.

450
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,820
So we're gonna do this together,

451
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,890
it's gonna take some time.

452
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,625
But it might feel weird for a little bit,

453
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,300
but it's gonna be great.

454
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,806
And I'm very, very excited.

455
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:31,159
So bear with us, we'll bear with you,

456
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:33,040
and we'll just be bears together.

457
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,511
Bears, beets, Battlestar Galactica.

458
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:37,077
(laughs) Thanks for watching, guys.

459
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:38,562
We are gonna call it a night.

460
00:13:38,562 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
