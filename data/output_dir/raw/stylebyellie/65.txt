1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
- Come here.

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:02,076
I've got something for you,

3
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:03,490
I've got something for you.

4
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,590
Ellie, I'm feeling our baby.

5
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,256
- [Ellie] Now look at a Who.

6
00:00:07,256 --> 00:00:08,089
(Jared laughing)

7
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:10,005
They look identical.

8
00:00:10,005 --> 00:00:11,010
- You stop right there.

9
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:11,843
- Oh no.

10
00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:15,020
Oh good morning, I feel a little full

11
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,780
in my belly, oh no.

12
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,650
I must've eaten too many sweets

13
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,300
and too much Dr. Pepper.

14
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,133
(laughing)

15
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,900
- (Calvin yelling)

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,640
- [Jared] Good morning bud.
(Calvin yelling)

17
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,473
- [Jared] Good morning.

18
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:28,830
Hey, where's Calvin?

19
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:29,663
(laughing)

20
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:30,496
What are you doing?

21
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,550
No that's no my actual belly.

22
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,970
You remember that I told you guys

23
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,731
I got some goodies in Las Vegas for you.

24
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,564
- Yay!

25
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:41,397
- [Jared] Would you like to see them?

26
00:00:41,397 --> 00:00:42,450
- Yeah.

27
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,840
- Okay, and I'll give 'em to ya, kay?

28
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,020
One of the funniest things
when I told the kids

29
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,220
that I was going to Las Vegas,

30
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,090
they said, are you gonna see Boss Baby

31
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,200
while you're in Las Vegas?

32
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,033
'Cause that's where they go

33
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,420
at the convention center in Las Vegas.

34
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,750
So when I was in Las Vegas

35
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,160
I thought of something
that I could get you

36
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,730
and there's not a lot of
things that you can get

37
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,796
kids in Las Vegas.

38
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:58,629
(laughs)

39
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:00,280
That's kind of a joke.

40
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,780
Yeah, there is a lot of stuff,

41
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,740
but I didn't have a chance
to go out and about.

42
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,530
But I wanted to get you guys something

43
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,790
that I thought would be fun

44
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,620
for you to keep for a long time, okay?

45
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,740
So this one's for you.

46
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,920
Don't open it yet.

47
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,420
And this one's for you.

48
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,650
Don't open it yet.

49
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,091
Mommy.

50
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:16,924
- [Ellie] What?

51
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:17,971
- Come here, I've got something for you.

52
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:19,887
I've got something for you.

53
00:01:19,887 --> 00:01:21,060
- [Ellie] I got something!

54
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,392
- [Jared] Come sit down
on the couch Mommarino.

55
00:01:23,392 --> 00:01:24,225
- Okay now I'm excited.

56
00:01:24,225 --> 00:01:25,730
- [Jared] Yeah.

57
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,054
This one's for you.

58
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:28,074
- [Ellie] Thanks Jared.

59
00:01:28,074 --> 00:01:30,313
(Jared laughs)

60
00:01:30,313 --> 00:01:31,820
I love little things.

61
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,736
- [Jared] Okay go ahead
and open 'em up guys.

62
00:01:33,736 --> 00:01:36,478
- You open first, I want--

63
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,185
- You want me to open it first?

64
00:01:38,185 --> 00:01:39,268
- Oh perfect.

65
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,380
- [Jared] It's a Las Vegas magnet,

66
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,924
because we visited Las Vegas.

67
00:01:43,924 --> 00:01:44,757
- I thought it was an ornament at first.

68
00:01:44,757 --> 00:01:46,508
- [Jackson] Calvin open it!

69
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,341
- Okay.

70
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:49,502
Hi.

71
00:01:51,107 --> 00:01:53,601
(gasps)

72
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:55,011
- [Jackson] Okay, it's my turn.

73
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:56,099
- [Ellie] Do you like that?

74
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,617
It's like a little mini snow globe.

75
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,701
- [Jared] Yeah.

76
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,534
- My turn.

77
00:01:59,534 --> 00:02:00,367
- [Jared] Go ahead bud.

78
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:04,610
- [Elile] Look.

79
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,510
What do you think?

80
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,463
- [Jared] Shake it up.

81
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,190
(bright guitar music)

82
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,270
Is that cool?

83
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,360
Here if you turn it upside down, watch,

84
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,450
you can see all of 'em come down.

85
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,830
- Thank you Dad.

86
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,010
- [Jared] You're welcome buddy.

87
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,870
- Thank you Jared.

88
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,454
This is cute.
- You're welcome.

89
00:02:19,454 --> 00:02:20,390
- What a fun morning.

90
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,426
- [Jared] Yeah, do you like 'em?

91
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:23,259
- I think that's cute,

92
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:24,670
because they loved the snow globe.

93
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,820
And this is mini.

94
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,653
- [Jared] Yeah.

95
00:02:26,653 --> 00:02:27,486
- Hard to break that one.

96
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:28,319
- Exactly.

97
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,840
We had fun, now it's back to work.

98
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,898
We got things to do around this house.

99
00:02:31,898 --> 00:02:35,065
(bright guitar music)

100
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:50,590
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

101
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,100
I had to sprint up here to get the camera.

102
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,470
Oh I still feel him.

103
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,370
- Isn't that crazy?

104
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:58,130
- Ellie I'm feeling our baby.

105
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:58,963
This is the first--

106
00:02:58,963 --> 00:03:00,390
oh my gosh!

107
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,610
- He is right there.

108
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,550
He's low.

109
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,530
- He is.

110
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,280
- He is so low.

111
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,260
Someone commented, they're like,

112
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,880
you're carrying so low.

113
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,350
And I'm like, with all of my boys,

114
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,450
I've carried so low.

115
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,790
- Oh my gosh, 16 weeks,
I am feeling the baby.

116
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,300
- Not too hard, because it's sensitive.

117
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,230
- Oh I'm sorry, sorry sorry.

118
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,010
I don't want to squish our little baby.

119
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,660
I don't think I've ever
felt a baby this early.

120
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,493
- It's his back.

121
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,920
And when the doctor was
doing the ultrasound,

122
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,840
he could hardly even get
a picture of his face.

123
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,930
'Cause his back is right there.

124
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,994
- Is he like a little hermit?

125
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:29,827
- Yeah.

126
00:03:29,827 --> 00:03:30,660
(laughing)

127
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,235
But he's so low.

128
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,802
- Oh yeah he's pretty low.

129
00:03:33,802 --> 00:03:34,635
- Isn't that cute?

130
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:36,530
- Yeah, our little lowrider.

131
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,773
- Yeah.

132
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:38,757
(gasps)

133
00:03:38,757 --> 00:03:39,590
That's so weird.

134
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,340
- I want to be involved.

135
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,260
- I won't show you where he's at,

136
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,300
because he's super duper low,
- Yeah.

137
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,750
- but I'll show you my tummy.

138
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,200
Is that crazy?

139
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,130
- [Jared] Hi little baby boy.

140
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,270
- He is so--

141
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,103
That's crazy.

142
00:03:52,103 --> 00:03:52,936
- [Jared] Ellie.

143
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,560
- Okay so when the doctor gave me

144
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,580
that ultrasound picture,

145
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,413
- [Jared] Yeah.

146
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,246
- I could hardly--

147
00:03:58,246 --> 00:03:59,100
because it was his back,

148
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,280
they all looked like blobs

149
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,110
and Jared's the one that
was like look at his face

150
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,370
and he looks just--

151
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,163
- [Jared] A Who?

152
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:05,996
- our other boys.

153
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,680
Oh let me show you the
picture I put together.

154
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,650
I was like, are people
gonna think I'm being mean?

155
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,736
So I didn't post it.

156
00:04:10,736 --> 00:04:14,054
- Well I guess it fits, 'cause
I look like the Grinch, so.

157
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,250
- Well I've always thought Jared,

158
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,083
when I first noticed him,

159
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,899
this is just unique.

160
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,732
- [Jared] Uh-huh.

161
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:20,709
- and look at the baby.

162
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,440
Okay so look at his ultrasound.

163
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,320
You can see his lips there,
his nose right there.

164
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,587
Now look at a Who.

165
00:04:27,587 --> 00:04:28,650
(Jared laughs)

166
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,900
They look identical.

167
00:04:31,317 --> 00:04:32,650
- That's so funny.
- Isn't that cute?

168
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,360
- [Jared] It's funny
Ellie, it's funny of you

169
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,193
to realize that.

170
00:04:35,193 --> 00:04:36,690
- I just had been staring at his picture

171
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,441
thinking he's so cute.

172
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:40,660
- Aww, our little boy.

173
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,070
We literally poked him too much

174
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,903
and now he's gone.

175
00:04:42,903 --> 00:04:44,784
- He moved, he's gone, I
don't know where he is.

176
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,750
(laughing)

177
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,077
- Sorry bud.

178
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:48,910
Who?

179
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,743
(Calvin screams)

180
00:04:49,743 --> 00:04:50,576
(Jared laughing)

181
00:04:50,576 --> 00:04:51,960
Caught ya.

182
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
Hi bud.

183
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,946
You having fun in the Hello Room?

184
00:04:55,946 --> 00:04:57,110
- Yeah.

185
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,610
- You got those darts on your fingers.

186
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,090
Did you guys ever get Bugles,

187
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,210
those corn tortilla chips, and
you put those on your fingers

188
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,892
and pretend you were a witch.

189
00:05:05,892 --> 00:05:07,550
- Yes, my mom never bought 'em,

190
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,040
but I loved when my friends did have them.

191
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,230
- Or olives.

192
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,820
Did you ever put olives on your finger

193
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,500
or anything with a hole inside it

194
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,730
that you put on your finger?

195
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,600
No yeah some?

196
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,430
I'm still on a high from feeling the baby.

197
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:25,080
That's so cool, it's just
very tender and sweet.

198
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,090
I remember--

199
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,030
Wait, how'd you get up there?

200
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,200
I remember when I heard about you

201
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,680
for the first time.

202
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,099
It's pretty fun, huh?

203
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:34,970
- Hey, you stop right there!

204
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,420
- Oh no, he's on to us, he's on to us.

205
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,993
- [Ellie] Get him, get him, get him.

206
00:05:38,993 --> 00:05:39,826
- Oh no.

207
00:05:39,826 --> 00:05:40,916
Ah get away!

208
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,690
Oh no!
(Jackson yells)

209
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,560
We're trapped, what are we gonna do now?

210
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,790
Oh no, we're locked in forever,

211
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,429
forever.

212
00:05:51,429 --> 00:05:52,262
- Forever.

213
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,124
- Forever.

214
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:57,116
- No!

215
00:05:57,116 --> 00:05:57,949
- [Jared] That's a bold
move, he's making an escape.

216
00:05:57,949 --> 00:05:59,758
Oh he's out of there.

217
00:05:59,758 --> 00:06:00,841
Ah no, ah ah!

218
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,980
Run away Calvin,
- Dad Dad!

219
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,960
- while you still can.
- Dad Dad, help help!

220
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,503
- [Jared] Run away while you still can.

221
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:09,336
- Dad!

222
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,169
- What a good soldier,

223
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,251
he wants to stay with me.

224
00:06:11,251 --> 00:06:14,540
He'd rather be captured,
than run away by himself.

225
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,650
I've been locked in by my own kind,

226
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,480
when will you let me out?

227
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,570
It's been 20 minutes since
I've been locked in here.

228
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,830
I'm beginning to starve.

229
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,760
There's a little water here.

230
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
Even though it's a full size kitchen,

231
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,610
for kids, there's little
food and water to drink.

232
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,060
I'm beginning to hallucinate.

233
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,172
I just don't know how I'll ever escape.

234
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:38,005
(gasps)

235
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,610
Oh wait, there's a window.

236
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,598
How did I not notice that

237
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:41,486
in the last 20 minutes?

238
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:42,928
(playful jazzy music)

239
00:06:42,928 --> 00:06:45,261
(whistling)

240
00:06:46,264 --> 00:06:47,264
Right there.

241
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:51,243
(squeak and pop)

242
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,980
Day log journal, day 325,

243
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,962
it seems like no matter how hard I try,

244
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,630
I cannot escape the window.

245
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,620
My hips just won't lie.

246
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,090
My hips don't lie guys.

247
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,090
I think my only escape

248
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,820
is if I make friends with the locals here

249
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,420
and exit through the front door.

250
00:07:14,373 --> 00:07:15,790
Will that happen?

251
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:18,701
Okay we're through.

252
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,254
(whispers) Let's see if we can get out

253
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:22,966
without them noticing.

254
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:25,465
- [On Television] I meant junior.

255
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:26,893
I'm all free.

256
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:29,358
I made it out alive.

257
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,908
I made it!

258
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,075
I'm home free!

259
00:07:33,345 --> 00:07:34,845
Free at last, woo!

260
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:38,597
Feels good to be free.

261
00:07:38,597 --> 00:07:39,580
Feels good to be free,

262
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,222
oh no!
- There you are!

263
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:42,889
- Ah, he's found me!

264
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,146
(laughing)

265
00:07:47,148 --> 00:07:48,431
You caught me.

266
00:07:48,431 --> 00:07:49,264
I'm sorry.

267
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:50,847
- Don't don't stop!

268
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,610
- I'll stop.

269
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,920
I'll stop.
- No.

270
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,230
- I'll stop.

271
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,260
You caught me again.

272
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,850
- [Ellie] Jackson asked if the cheese came

273
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,420
and Calvin ran and grabbed cheese.

274
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,280
Is that for dinner?

275
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,447
Yeah, we ordered pizza
and we have a blanket out.

276
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,930
There's a new movie, it's Paddington 2.

277
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,410
It's in the movie theaters.

278
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,620
And I want to take the kids to it so bad.

279
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,938
But they haven't seen the first one,

280
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:19,310
so we're gonna sit, we're
gonna watch Paddington.

281
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,720
Bonnie says she loves it

282
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,370
and it's a cute movie.

283
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,470
We have pizza.

284
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,590
Calvin just came up to me and hugged me

285
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,450
and hit my belly and lifted up my shirt

286
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,680
and goes, baby.

287
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,491
And just nuggled my stomach.

288
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,620
- It was cute.

289
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,900
He rubbed his nose on your belly.

290
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,208
It was sweet.

291
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,279
- Awww.

292
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,870
Okay, I think we're watching Paddington

293
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,299
more than the kids, but I love it.

294
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:41,499
- I've been having a good time,

295
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,659
it's a funny show.

296
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,450
- [Ellie] They're over there
making food for each other.

297
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,000
- It's pretty rare for Ellie

298
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,410
to ask me to get her something,

299
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,370
something that she
doesn't usually ask for.

300
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,950
It's a Dr. Pepper.

301
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,040
So you either know she's
having a really really good day

302
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,677
or she's like, I just
need a little pick me up.

303
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:02,940
(laughs)

304
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,854
So I'm getting Ellie a Dr. Pepper

305
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:06,220
with a straw.

306
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,690
Those are the requirements.

307
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,250
She's in the bathtub right now.

308
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:12,680
So I think she just wants
a little relaxation mode

309
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,000
before she goes to bed.

310
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,610
Oh my goodness, last straw.

311
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,720
I think Ellie is due for a nice warm bath

312
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,230
and a little Kardashians
or something like that

313
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,360
and a Dr. Pepper.

314
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,240
- [Ellie] My head hurts.

315
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,900
- I'm sorry your head hurts.

316
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,280
- [Ellie] It's because I had to cancel

317
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,730
my chiropractor appointment.

318
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,290
- Well let's see if we can
get you in tomorrow, yeah?

319
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,123
Or the next day?

320
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,200
- [Ellie] That goes to show it's working.

321
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,100
- Oh yeah, 'cause you
missed it and you're like,

322
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,370
oh my little head.

323
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,570
Oh my little head.

324
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,875
Oh don't flip me off.

325
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,290
(Ellie laughs)

326
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,280
- [Ellie] Go away.

327
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,320
- You want to know one
of my favorite moments

328
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,170
in Ellie and Jared history,

329
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,450
is when you flipped off the camera

330
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,989
when you had your D&C.

331
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,822
- [Ellie] Yes.

332
00:09:50,822 --> 00:09:52,360
- It was raw and real

333
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,815
and I think it was just tender, you know?

334
00:09:54,815 --> 00:09:56,807
- [Ellie] What do you think
my number one emoji is?

335
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,130
(laughing)

336
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,300
- Enjoy your bath and Dr. Pepper.

337
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,640
- [Ellie] Smiley face and flip off emoji.

338
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,310
- Are you gonna watch
Kardashians or something?

339
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,040
- [Ellie] No, I'm gonna
look at maternity shirts.

340
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,740
- Ooh maternity shirts.

341
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,500
If you guys have any ideas

342
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,250
of where to get cute maternity clothes,

343
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,780
- [Ellie] I did see awesome ones.

344
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,350
- Let us know in the comments.

345
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,250
Ellie tweeted out,

346
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,980
and everyone's gave her
some really good ideas.

347
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,520
And then I tweeted out
if anyone has any idea

348
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,620
where I can get a good Tesla,

349
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,960
let me know.

350
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,910
I'm such a nerd.

351
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,860
And I play off your tweets, it's funny.

352
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,210
Sometimes I wonder to
myself, and I say self,

353
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,623
why are you doing this?

354
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,470
And sometimes the answer is simply

355
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,460
just because it's the internet.

356
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm not sure how this reaction

357
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,500
is going to go, but I wanted to show you

358
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,660
what I'm putting in the video

359
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,330
that's goes up for me tomorrow,

360
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,780
for you it's been awhile.

361
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,060
But I'm putting this in the video.

362
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,580
I don't know why, I
think it's kinda funny.

363
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,870
But alas, here it is.

364
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:47,970
This is the internet.

365
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,183
(bright music)

366
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,710
Why I'm doing this, I have no idea.

367
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,543
I thought it was funny,

368
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:04,661
maybe it's not, what do you think?

369
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:06,200
I don't know, I'm sorry about that

370
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,033
if you didn't enjoy it.

371
00:11:07,033 --> 00:11:09,820
Penny, you are doing exactly what I want

372
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,455
to be doing right now.

373
00:11:11,455 --> 00:11:13,390
I'm sorry, I didn't mean

374
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,440
to wake you up too much.

375
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,870
Oh get that stretch out.

376
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,930
Get that stretch out.

377
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,580
So I've been talking with Dan.

378
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,070
We did a test of the Model
3 versus the Model X Tesla

379
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:25,270
on their shocks, and he
just sent me the first draft

380
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,200
and it's a really cool video.

381
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,530
So when that video is up,

382
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,270
I will put a link in the description,

383
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,660
so you guys can check that out.

384
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,925
We had some pretty interesting results

385
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,530
when we did these tests,

386
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,900
between two Tesla cars.

387
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,640
Just makes me want a Tesla all the more.

388
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,990
I'm sorry it's annoying by now,

389
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,780
but that's beside the point.

390
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,370
Anyway, thank you guys
so much for watching.

391
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,240
If you enjoyed the video,

392
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
give it a big thumbs up

393
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,460
and we will see you guys tomorrow.

394
00:11:47,460 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
