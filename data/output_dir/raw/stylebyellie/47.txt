1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,740
- Last night something
very cool and very special,

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:06,060
especially to Mom and
Dad, happened last night.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,630
What would you do if you weren't afraid?

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,420
- [Ellie] I went from
looking at 19 weeks pregnant

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:13,510
to 22 weeks pregnant!

6
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,490
Calvin likes Penny a lot more

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,780
when she's eating a treat

8
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,900
'cause he can have the time to pet her

9
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,010
'cause she doesn't move around so much.

10
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,260
Is that your puppy dog?

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,850
She's your puppy, huh?

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,701
- No.

13
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:26,830
Hey!

14
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,663
- [Ellie] Oh, fine.

15
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:28,546
She's Penny.

16
00:00:28,546 --> 00:00:30,320
(laughs) That was cute.

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,780
No, Penny.
- No.

18
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,280
- He's watching the kids play.

19
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,400
Calvin's on his bike.

20
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,370
Oh and Jackson's on his bike, too.

21
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:42,220
I thought he got on the hoverboard
but he's on his bike now.

22
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:43,210
Good morning, guys!

23
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,050
We have got the house cleaned.

24
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,450
We have got all of our tummies fed.

25
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,200
Got my bed made.

26
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,360
The kids did so awesome last night.

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,970
We've been really working with them,

28
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,070
telling them to stay in their beds,

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,614
and not come into our bed at night,

30
00:00:58,614 --> 00:01:01,260
which I haven't minded having the kids

31
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,810
come in our room at night

32
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,860
but I am trying to prep
and get everything ready

33
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,200
for when the baby does come

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,700
because I would hate
for the kids to continue

35
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,260
to get in our bed at night

36
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,450
and then the baby comes,
the baby wakes them up,

37
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,090
or just kind of like disrupting everybody,

38
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,970
and so they did so good last night.

39
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,020
They all slept in their
beds all night long

40
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,560
and I'm really proud of them.

41
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,860
So they're outside playing right now

42
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,720
and I'm getting ready for a fun date.

43
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,170
I'm going to the Albion party tonight.

44
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,080
I was invited!

45
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:32,280
I was so excited so I'm
getting my hair dried,

46
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,640
getting it curled.

47
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,700
I didn't sleep much, though,

48
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,340
'cause if you guys saw my Instagram story

49
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,823
or if you saw our vlog from
yesterday, we showed my back.

50
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:43,300
(gasps) It is so much
worse than I thought.

51
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,560
Like, the cut is that long.

52
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,393
Crazy.

53
00:01:46,393 --> 00:01:49,045
So I didn't sleep much 'cause
I was like rolling around.

54
00:01:49,045 --> 00:01:51,660
I think when it heals a
little bit more in a few days

55
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,720
it'll feel better to like sleep on.

56
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,650
Hi, baby!

57
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,810
How are you?

58
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:57,860
Okay well I'm getting dressed.

59
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,730
I'm wearing a dress tonight
because it's kind of fancy

60
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,810
and dresses are super
comfortable right now.

61
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,190
Bonnie has been giving me
a little tip on my hair.

62
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:08,979
I was asking her, "Is it still cute short?

63
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:10,299
"Is there anything I should
do different with it?"

64
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,980
And she said, "You always
curl the midshaft to the end."

65
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,150
She goes, "Curl the top a little tighter.

66
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,870
"Have it be a little
more like umph to it."

67
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,620
And I was like, "Oh I need
a smaller curling iron."

68
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,453
Went to the store.

69
00:02:21,453 --> 00:02:24,300
I didn't really see any that
I liked and then I was like,

70
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,100
"Can I go to your house
and borrow a curling iron?"

71
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,330
So I went to her house.

72
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,580
Lo and behold!

73
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,560
This is my flipping curling
iron, Bonnie! (laughs)

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,730
She had my curling iron at her house.

75
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,040
Totally forgot that I had it.

76
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,210
I love that it's short right here, big.

77
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,300
It's the NuMe Wand,

78
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,450
just like my other one that I always use,

79
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,280
but it's tighter so it'll be really tight

80
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,390
on the top of my hair.

81
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:47,910
So funny, huh?

82
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,790
You forget what you have
and then your sister has it,

83
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,830
then she forgets it's yours

84
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,850
and 10 years later you get it back!

85
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,310
So, with my hair, I'm
literally just taking sections

86
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,530
and curling it right to the scalp,

87
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,070
but leaving like an inch out

88
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,722
and then when I'm all
done, I'll fluff it up.

89
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:07,060
(light music)

90
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,200
While I sit and wait for my curls to set

91
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,410
before I ruffle them up,

92
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:13,290
I'm going to watch a YouTube video.

93
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,970
And Bonnie keeps saying, "Have you watched

94
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:17,130
"my San Francisco video yet?"

95
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,840
And I have been dying to watch it.

96
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,660
I just, I haven't yet so I'm watching

97
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,920
her San Francisco video
and I'm getting ready!

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,640
- So when I went to do
my hair this morning,

99
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,250
I was looking for my product

100
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,810
and I realized that Joel
had taken it from me.

101
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,970
What the heck, Joel?

102
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,960
So I went over to his
house and I grabbed it.

103
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,060
For those of you who don't know,

104
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,630
the product that I use the most

105
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,070
is Paul Mitchell Flexible Style Spray Wax.

106
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,400
It's a nice, hearty spray
wax that goes on really soft

107
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,170
but it holds really well,

108
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,880
and then once I actually do my hair,

109
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,290
I top it off with some Bed Head TIGI.

110
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,440
Just a little bit!

111
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,800
Just to keep that shape and hold.

112
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,110
The nice thing is the Paul
Mitchell gives it a nice dry hold

113
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:01,370
but then the hairspray gives
it a nice little shine texture,

114
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,450
so you've got the best of both worlds.

115
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,081
Don't you agree with that Jackson?

116
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,914
- Yeah.

117
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:07,410
- Doesn't my hair look nice?
- Yeah.

118
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,250
- Yeah, I think your hair looks nice, too.

119
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,000
You've got that nice little
tweaker going on in the back.

120
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,160
It's just your style.

121
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,950
It's just what compliments you a lot.

122
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,890
So, yeah, that's what I do

123
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,680
is I just kind of brush my hair up.

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,339
I get the volume.

125
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:22,173
What?

126
00:04:22,173 --> 00:04:23,070
- It's curly.
- It's curly?

127
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,500
Do you like the curly Q's?
- Uh uh.

128
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,180
- Do you want your hair like
Daddy's or like Mommy's?

129
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,860
Like me?

130
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,210
Okay.

131
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,720
Maybe we can fix your hair.

132
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,398
So now that I've got my product back.

133
00:04:35,398 --> 00:04:36,968
(fake laughs) Thanks, Joel!

134
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:38,136
Just kidding!

135
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,358
I'm just kind of making fun of Ellie

136
00:04:39,358 --> 00:04:41,150
and what they did but yeah.

137
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,180
Okay, boys.

138
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,860
Let's do your hair, silly pants McGee,

139
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,850
before we go.

140
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,030
Okay? Sound good?

141
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,540
You've got some coins, too.

142
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,960
When your piggy bank is full,

143
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,373
we can go get them exchanged
for dollar bills, too.

144
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:55,456
(light guitar music)

145
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,950
(Calvin laughs)

146
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:08,650
Alright so last night something
very cool and very special,

147
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,990
especially to Mom and
Dad, happened last night.

148
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,310
Can you tell us what happened?

149
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,580
- We slept in our own beds too much.

150
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,880
- Yes, you did!

151
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,870
You slept all through the night.

152
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,740
Both of you!

153
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,430
You didn't get out of bed

154
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,570
and Mommy and Daddy slept the whole night,

155
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,380
so high five.

156
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,490
Congratulations!

157
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,870
High five right here, Cal.

158
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,703
Boom!

159
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,810
So one thing that the
boys have been doing,

160
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,810
they've been staying in their
room really, really great

161
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,130
but they've been waking up
in the middle of the night.

162
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,290
That's nothing new.

163
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,356
They've always done that

164
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:42,750
but sleeping through the
night has been something

165
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,770
that they've struggled with

166
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,760
and they did it for
the first time together

167
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,140
and it was amazing so--

168
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,973
- [Ellie] Since Christmas!

169
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:49,970
- Yes, since Christmas.

170
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,820
I guess since Christmas Eve, right?

171
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,653
- [Ellie] Yeah.

172
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:53,590
- Since Christmas Eve.

173
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,280
So when you woke up this morning,

174
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,380
I came to your room and
what did Dad have for you?

175
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,160
- Question mark box.

176
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,910
- Yeah and inside that
question mark box from Mario,

177
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,470
what was inside?

178
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,303
Boom!

179
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:07,660
A Mario hat.

180
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,480
A Mario coin.

181
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,930
A toadstool thing.

182
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,680
We had a box from Mario that was so cool.

183
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,520
Oh, we just did your hair.

184
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,620
Let's not put that on.

185
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:18,610
- Hey!

186
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,559
(Jared laughs)

187
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:21,620
- Thank you for sleeping all night long.

188
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,124
Give me a hug!
- Gimme, gimme!

189
00:06:24,124 --> 00:06:26,270
- Love me!

190
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,305
- [Ellie] Well, you look beautiful!

191
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,760
- Thanks!

192
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,480
- And I am so happy with
how my hair turned out!

193
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:37,710
It is like full and like ready to party!

194
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:39,490
- It's super flirty--
- I love it.

195
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,786
- It's flirty and fun.
- Yahoo.

196
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:44,050
(upbeat guitar music)

197
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,770
I went from looking 19 weeks pregnant

198
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,900
to 22 weeks pregnant!

199
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,390
I've been eating so much, guys.

200
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:54,700
I'm spoiled and we got
to go to The Melting Pot.

201
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,020
Yay!

202
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,193
Ashley!

203
00:06:58,193 --> 00:06:59,390
This is our friend, Ashley.

204
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,610
I went to The Melting
Pot earlier this week

205
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,690
with my girlfriends,

206
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,300
and then with us going
to the party tonight,

207
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,510
we wanted to go to dinner
before so Melting Pot again.

208
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,870
So we're getting our cheese

209
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,540
and we're ordering our chocolate next.

210
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,469
There you go.

211
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,607
(laughing)

212
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,426
Now you can blow it out
now that I got the shot.

213
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:16,590
(laughing)

214
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,423
Thank you!

215
00:07:17,423 --> 00:07:18,256
That's awesome.

216
00:07:18,256 --> 00:07:19,844
This looks wonderful.

217
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:23,011
(upbeat guitar music)

218
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,290
After baby comes, that's
the swimming suit I want!

219
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,152
(upbeat guitar music)

220
00:07:36,152 --> 00:07:36,985
- Hey, there.

221
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:38,200
Long time no talk.

222
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,407
It is midnight and I just got home.

223
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:46,407
I drove two hours south to Utah Valley

224
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,470
and I was able to go to a
meeting of Richie Norton

225
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:54,300
and a couple of his buddies

226
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,490
that they have a business together.

227
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:59,150
The meeting was all about some principles

228
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,820
that Richie has taught for a long time,

229
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,270
and it was just really, really great.

230
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:10,340
I find myself in periods of time

231
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,340
where I am super motivated to do things

232
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,520
and then I kind of find
myself in a little slump.

233
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:20,040
And then I get back into the
super motivated period of time.

234
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,560
Right now I'm in that super
motivated period of time

235
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,400
and I don't want to get
into that slump period

236
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,740
and everything that I've
talked about in the past,

237
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,000
I've tried to act on the
things that I've said

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,169
that I would do and, you know,
practice what you preach.

239
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,569
I love self-help, motivational speaking,

240
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,929
I love all of that stuff

241
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,900
because it's so cool to hear
and to learn and to apply.

242
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,250
And the application is
the most important thing.

243
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,040
You can hear and teach all of these things

244
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
but the application is
the most important thing

245
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,220
and we're applying a
lot of different things,

246
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,630
and that's why I keep saying
2018 is going to be so amazing

247
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:02,290
is because we're applying
a lot of these things

248
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,340
that we've learned and
you'll see that very soon.

249
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,240
But I just wanted to come on

250
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,130
and just talk about a couple
things before we end the vlog.

251
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,060
I've said a lot in the past,

252
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,150
"What would you do if you weren't afraid?"

253
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,240
And we've talked about that.

254
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,200
That's kind of been a
theme that I've brought

255
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,230
to Ellie and I, and our family,
and to the vlog channels.

256
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,300
What would you do if you weren't afraid?

257
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,760
But I feel like the last year,
I've kind of forgot that.

258
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,650
And, you know, a period of down time

259
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:35,290
and now I'm super
motivated again. (laughs)

260
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,516
It's funny how it just comes in waves.

261
00:09:37,516 --> 00:09:40,750
But I'm asking myself what
would I do if I weren't afraid

262
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,670
but not only that like,
what would you want to do?

263
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,640
And then my next question is,

264
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,750
what's stopping you and
why is it stopping you?

265
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,580
In my mind right now, I'm
thinking about retirement.

266
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,785
Like 65 years old retirement.

267
00:09:56,785 --> 00:10:00,250
What will I want to do when I'm like,

268
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,900
when I'm retired this is going
to be what I'm going to do,

269
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,300
I'm going to finally
relax when I'm retired.

270
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,133
Those kinds of things.

271
00:10:06,133 --> 00:10:06,966
I think of my dad.

272
00:10:06,966 --> 00:10:07,799
I think of Ellie's dad.

273
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,570
When we're finally retired,
what do we want to do?

274
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,030
If we have that mindset, we're
always going to be waiting.

275
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,770
What is stopping us right now

276
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,750
from doing the thing that we want to do?

277
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,600
And so I'm just kind of thinking
about that and thinking,

278
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,120
if I'm putting myself years
ahead of where I am now,

279
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,560
what will I look back on and regret?

280
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:35,170
I am so grateful that Ellie
and I decided to do this

281
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,620
and so many other ventures
that are happening later on.

282
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,260
And I don't want to live
with excessive regret.

283
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,790
I'm sure there's going to be some things

284
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,430
that we regret in the future.

285
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,490
I don't want to have excessive regret

286
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:51,280
to the point where I wish
I would have done something

287
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,370
where I have the opportunity
to do it right now.

288
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:57,050
What would you do if you weren't afraid?

289
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,883
I got home.

290
00:10:57,883 --> 00:11:00,450
I've been having a
two-hour car ride there,

291
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,700
a two-hour car ride back,

292
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,520
and I've just been thinking
and I don't even know

293
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,300
if any of this makes sense to any of you.

294
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,740
It may be like, oh, Jared,
you're just talking again.

295
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,340
Another part of why we do this
is this is a journal for us.

296
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,550
This is something I can look back on

297
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,670
and I know that today is going to be a day

298
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,600
that, going forward,
things are going to change

299
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,550
and be exciting for us.

300
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,800
This is the start of something new.

301
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,106
I want this to be a moment
where I look back and be like,

302
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:28,603
right there is where it happened.

303
00:11:28,603 --> 00:11:31,913
So thank you for listening.

304
00:11:31,913 --> 00:11:33,250
(laughs)

305
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,613
It's kind of funny but when I vlog,

306
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:40,450
I imagine you that I'm talking to.

307
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,900
Not that I'm talking to a camera
but I imagine our audience.

308
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,340
I try and picture our audience
as like one individual

309
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,670
and I'm talking to you and I'm thinking.

310
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,100
But I'm also talking to
myself, talking to Jared.

311
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,010
So it's kind of funny holding a camera,

312
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,940
imagining you and imagining myself.

313
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,560
Whether that's future Jared or past Jared.

314
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,290
But I'm grateful for the support,

315
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,570
I'm grateful for what we do,
I'm grateful for my family,

316
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,920
there's just a lot of gratitude
in my heart right now.

317
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,620
That is where I'm going to leave you.

318
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,300
Thank you so much for watching.

319
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,120
This weekend is going to be a blast.

320
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,600
We're gonna have a lot of family around.

321
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,960
It's the Super Bowl.

322
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,740
Who are you rooting for in the Super Bowl?

323
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,820
I guess by the time the video
goes up, it's already done.

324
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,760
We already know who decided

325
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,140
so congratulations to
those people who won.

326
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,530
But thanks for watching, guys

327
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,779
and we will see you next time.

328
00:12:28,779 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
