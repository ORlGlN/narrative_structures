1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,220
(gentle piano music)

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:03,053
- Hi Mom.

3
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,460
- Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

4
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,080
this is called redemption.

5
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:01,500
Here you are my wife, a whole box.

6
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,430
- A whole box.

7
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,560
- [Jared] Just for you.

8
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,910
- Because you should never get a donut

9
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,450
behind your pregnant wife's back

10
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,000
and then not tell her, and
let her sister tell her.

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,910
- There were some words that should

12
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,480
not have been said last night.

13
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,809
- Yes they should have.

14
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:15,720
(Jared laughs)

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,641
- I love you.

16
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,474
- I love you.

17
00:01:17,474 --> 00:01:18,307
- It's spicy.

18
00:01:18,307 --> 00:01:19,156
- [Ellie] It's spicy?

19
00:01:19,156 --> 00:01:21,777
- [Jackson] I want to do it, I want one.

20
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:24,360
(Ellie laughs)

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,840
- [Ellie] Oh my goodness.

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,673
- Spicy.

23
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:29,379
- [Ellie] It's spicy?

24
00:01:29,379 --> 00:01:30,212
- Me.

25
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:31,045
- [Ellie] You want it?

26
00:01:31,045 --> 00:01:32,390
Here, you eat the rest
of your strawberries.

27
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,850
I'll save the lemon for my water.

28
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,830
- Lemons are so spicy.

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,520
- [Ellie] 'Cause lemons
are sour, lemons and limes.

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,270
So sour, but watermelon
and strawberries, mmm mmm.

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,769
Those are yummy, huh?

32
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:45,758
- Yeah.

33
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:48,341
(bright music)

34
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:21,830
- Wee, let's go.

35
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:22,860
- [Jared] Are you ready Mama?

36
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,693
- I am ready.

37
00:02:23,693 --> 00:02:24,526
- [Jared] Let's go.

38
00:02:24,526 --> 00:02:26,070
- Okay I have our grocery list.

39
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,885
The next few days are going to be so fun.

40
00:02:28,885 --> 00:02:29,892
- [Jared] Mmm-hmm.

41
00:02:29,892 --> 00:02:31,637
♪ Eyes to see ♪

42
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:35,054
♪ I close my eyes to see ♪

43
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,220
(laughs)

44
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,410
- We asked Jackson,
should we watch Clifford

45
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,307
or should we listen to Greatest Showman?

46
00:02:41,307 --> 00:02:43,300
Actually it was his choice,

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,370
The Greatest Showman was on
and he asked to watch Clifford

48
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,350
so I went to put it in

49
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,910
and he said, no I want to
watch Greatest Showman!

50
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,680
So, we're listening to
the music, huh Mr. Jacks?

51
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,580
- I could definitely get used to this.

52
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,700
What do you guys think?

53
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,610
Pretty cool?

54
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,170
That's the front,

55
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,970
that's the back,

56
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,660
here's the bed.

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,530
Pretty incredible, right?

58
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,363
It's not ours.

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,650
Did I scare you for a second?

60
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm actually at the RV store,

61
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,200
because I'm grabbing a
part for our car to tow

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,740
our trailer that we have,

63
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,700
the one that we love.

64
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,370
Because we're going on a family adventure

65
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,270
very very soon and we're
taking the trailer,

66
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,103
we're packing it up

67
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:23,521
and we're having a little fun.

68
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:26,104
(lively music)

69
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,380
- I don't know who I yell at more,

70
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,797
Calvin or Penny.

71
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,023
(laughs)

72
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:41,856
Calvin!

73
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,821
Let's go give it back to Jackson!

74
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:44,654
Okay,
(Calvin squealss)

75
00:03:44,654 --> 00:03:46,130
got your arm, let's go back to Jackson,

76
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:46,963
give it back.

77
00:03:46,963 --> 00:03:48,190
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

78
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,710
Okay go give it back.

79
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,770
Perfect.

80
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,900
Jackson, did you know
that I've been cleaning

81
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,811
your ears since you've been
just a little tiny baby?

82
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,644
- Yeah.

83
00:03:56,644 --> 00:03:58,866
- [Ellie] And did you
know that I used to sing

84
00:03:58,866 --> 00:03:59,882
♪ Clean clean clean ♪

85
00:03:59,882 --> 00:04:01,299
♪ clean clean clean ♪

86
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,132
- Yeah.

87
00:04:02,132 --> 00:04:03,615
- [Ellie] And that used
to make you not cry.

88
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:04,448
- Yeah.

89
00:04:04,448 --> 00:04:05,360
- [Ellie] You would just be so good.

90
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,193
I used to go

91
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:07,275
♪ Clean clean clean ♪

92
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:08,740
♪ clean clean clean ♪

93
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,573
And that was it

94
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:11,020
and then you'd be done.

95
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,853
- Yay now I'm done.

96
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:13,610
- And did you know I
used to brush your teeth

97
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,990
that way too?

98
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,140
It's like, when do you stop doing that?

99
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,672
I used to do that with
Jackson all the time, I'd go

100
00:04:19,672 --> 00:04:21,055
♪ Clean clean clean ♪

101
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:21,888
♪ Clean clean clean ♪

102
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,358
and that would give me long enough

103
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:25,130
to be able to clean his ears

104
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,660
and then I would do the same
when I brushed his teeth.

105
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,350
I don't remember the last time I did that.

106
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,100
But I remember I used
to do it all the time.

107
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,410
K, bedtime!

108
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,460
Go put that one away.

109
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,720
Perfect.

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,160
So many clothes, I gotta get packing.

111
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,710
Getting ready for our
little family getaway,

112
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm very excited for.

113
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,980
There's a few things
that I really want to do

114
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,020
before baby comes

115
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,560
and we happen to be doing two
of those things this week.

116
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,810
But one of them for sure is a get away

117
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,270
with everybody and Penny.

118
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,620
And so Jared's getting the camper ready,

119
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,230
I'm getting packed up, ready to go,

120
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,800
I have a grocery list that I've made

121
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
of things that we're gonna eat.

122
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,520
And we're just gonna go
have fun for a few days

123
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,410
in our camper.

124
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,170
We're gonna enjoy the sun.

125
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,870
We're gonna go on some hikes, so,

126
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,450
I'm just super excited
to get out of the snow

127
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,490
and just go play and let
Penny run at some parks.

128
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,410
Right now I am packing for two boys,

129
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:23,090
but pretty soon, I'm going
to be packing for three boys.

130
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,122
And it's just really crazy

131
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,070
that I say that.

132
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,370
It still is unreal to me

133
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,240
and I'm gonna give you guys
just a little baby update.

134
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,110
(boys laughing)

135
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,860
Can you hear them laughing?

136
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,280
This is what they do every single night

137
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,030
and it makes me so happy and grateful.

138
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,840
My boys laugh every single night

139
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,020
and then here in ten minutes,

140
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,450
they will go to sleep.

141
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,480
Ah, my heart.

142
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,730
I am 24 weeks pregnant

143
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,000
and the baby is the size of a cantaloupe.

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,500
The baby is already starting

145
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,720
to get his wake time and nap time

146
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,710
routine starting right now.

147
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,300
I think for the first time

148
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,210
in my pregnancy, I had a good dream.

149
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,470
It wasn't a scary dream,

150
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,856
it wasn't me and Jared fighting,

151
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:12,660
it wasn't intense,

152
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,780
it was peaceful and sweet and it was,

153
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,400
I deserved that, and I'm so glad.

154
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,720
I had a dream of me holding him

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,310
and I saw his little face

156
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,080
and I just was holding him

157
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,350
and it was as real as could be.

158
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,810
And then I woke up super fast.

159
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,690
It was like a glimpse of him

160
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,240
and then I was awake.

161
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,710
And I thought about it
for two days straight

162
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,170
and I wish so bad I could have

163
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,150
another dream of him,

164
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,510
but it was so real.

165
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,420
So it's just making me even more excited

166
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,320
to hold him.

167
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,970
But I can see why,

168
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,570
so I've never owned a DockATot,

169
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,120
which I got for the baby.

170
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,810
I can see why people really love it,

171
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:55,290
because I have been snuggling

172
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,900
and have been cocooned
in my pregnancy pillow.

173
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,370
I love it.

174
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,410
And then in the mornings,

175
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,880
when I wake up, Calvin will push me over,

176
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,640
make me scoot over to one side

177
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,060
so he can cuddle one side of the pillow.

178
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,090
So I'm excited for the baby to try that

179
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,010
and for me to see if babies like that too.

180
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,610
Obviously they like to be cocooned,

181
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,710
but it'll just be really fun.

182
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,100
But I'm loving my pregnancy pillow.

183
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,630
I've been feeling this
week has been a good week,

184
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,880
especially emotionally.

185
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,710
I've been feeling really good.

186
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,220
I am 24 weeks, it's flying by.

187
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,240
I have been drinking a ton of water,

188
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,650
strawberries, lemon, strawberry and lime,

189
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,030
I fill this bad boy up several times a day

190
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,010
and I drink it.

191
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,830
But this week, you can
tend to get more leg cramps

192
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,960
and back cramps, so in my app,

193
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,530
I have the Bump app.

194
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,669
In the app it tells you each week

195
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:53,150
what you should be feeling
or what's going on,

196
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,530
it's called The Bump.

197
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,700
So I'll click on it,

198
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,440
and I'll go down, it'll
talk about the baby

199
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,480
at 24 weeks.

200
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,510
And it says that this week stay hydrated,

201
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,910
because you can start to get a lot

202
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:06,290
of leg cramps and your
belly's growing even more.

203
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,610
And this week my belly has popped.

204
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,690
Like I've had a belly,

205
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,270
but it is there and I am pregnant.

206
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,500
I've had a few Braxton contractions

207
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,700
that have been so unbelievably tight

208
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,630
and I'm just like (breaths),
I have to sit down

209
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,160
and breath it out, it is crazy.

210
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,940
And then I've been getting some leg cramps

211
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,230
and I've been getting
tons of Charley horse's

212
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:29,070
in my toes, like tons.

213
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:31,820
So, I've been trying to drink
more water because of that.

214
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,490
And then Jared had got me a Bump box,

215
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:38,429
so every month I'll get
a little box of goodies.

216
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,669
And about two months ago,
I had got this body wash

217
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:45,890
and I just got done with it.

218
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,460
And it smelled so good and it was awesome,

219
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,460
so I'm actually gonna try and look this up

220
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,570
and get some more of this

221
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:54,790
or I really want to try the Dr. Bronner's,

222
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,620
his body wash, I want to try that too.

223
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,810
I haven't always been a body wash person,

224
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,880
like I just use soap and that's it,

225
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,820
but I've actually really been liking

226
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,670
how gentle this has been.

227
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,400
I really want to try the
Dr. Bronner's body wash.

228
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,800
I was actually going to order it

229
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,010
and then this had came in the mail,

230
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,190
so I didn't order it.

231
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,890
But that's what I want to try next.

232
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,590
And the last thing with baby is,

233
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,390
I am finishing up his nursery,

234
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,000
I've already showed you
guys the design plans in it.

235
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,150
But I saw this and it
instantly made me tear up

236
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,340
and I totally got it

237
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,410
and I can't wait to put it
on his shelf in his room.

238
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,730
And then to take it off his shelf

239
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,150
and let him play with it.

240
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,670
I found this cute little website,

241
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,470
it's called Little Saplings Toys.

242
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,020
But it's just handmade
little wooden rainbow

243
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,090
and I just thought that
was perfect for him

244
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,760
and I cannot wait to get it

245
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,470
and have that in his room

246
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,050
with a picture of an
ultrasound next to it.

247
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,450
I think that'll look really cute,

248
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:49,530
so I got that for baby.

249
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,770
Overall, I have been feeling really good.

250
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,560
I have been trying really
hard to rest a lot,

251
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,000
because I know that I am not going

252
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,710
to be able to once he's here, as much.

253
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,180
I love my quiet time with the kids

254
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,230
while we watch shows.

255
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,350
Today, I was on the couch

256
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,600
and Calvin's hand was right here,

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,410
and then he goes, huge baby, baby

258
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,890
and then he just sat there for a minute

259
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,980
and rubbed my tummy.

260
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,590
And then Jackson was cuddling me

261
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,000
and rubbing my tummy.

262
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,620
And when I sit on the couch,

263
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,905
it's not like I'm like,
come here, cuddle me boys.

264
00:10:21,905 --> 00:10:24,580
I sit down and they gravitate towards me.

265
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,320
I swear I don't just put them on me,

266
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,610
just for a picture or just a video.

267
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:31,790
They just gravitate and snuggle me.

268
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,320
Everyday Jackson's like,

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,760
will you cuddle me and watch a show,

270
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,360
and I'm always like, yes I will.

271
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,250
I just love how cuddly they are

272
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,520
and just them being right by me today

273
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,140
and then noticing my
belly and rubbing my belly

274
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,370
and laying on my belly,

275
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:47,340
it just reminds me of
the picture that I took

276
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,910
of Jackson laying on my belly

277
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,950
the day before Calvin was born.

278
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,980
And I remember that moment,

279
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,310
or it was that day that I went in.

280
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:58,150
I think it was that day
that I went in, that night.

281
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,810
I remember taking that picture

282
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,580
and just having such a special feeling.

283
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,970
And maybe that feeling was knowing

284
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,120
that was the last picture with Jackson.

285
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,209
It was just so sweet

286
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,759
and my hormones are all over the place.

287
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,592
(laughs)

288
00:11:11,592 --> 00:11:13,980
I'm such a brat to people.

289
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,600
Jared's probably so sick of me.

290
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,130
And I cry a lot, I already cry a lot,

291
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,270
but just even talking
about that moment's sweet,

292
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,030
because I told Jackson.

293
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,730
I've been trying really hard

294
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,490
to give Jackson a ton of one on one time,

295
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,350
because it makes me kinda sad

296
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,260
knowing that another baby is coming,

297
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,390
because when I had Calvin, I remember,

298
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,500
why am I crying?

299
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,440
We're gonna cut this.

300
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,870
Before I delivered Calvin,

301
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,020
I remember rocking Jackson,

302
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,610
we're gonna cut this,

303
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,960
I don't know why I'm crying.

304
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,520
But I remember before having Calvin,

305
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,020
I was rocking Jackson

306
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,730
and I remember whispering in his ear,

307
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,570
you're always going to be my baby

308
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,230
and it's just kina weird

309
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,940
to think that I'm gonna have another baby,

310
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,320
it's just crazy to me.

311
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,480
So I'm really trying to take my time

312
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,313
throughout the day

313
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:05,130
and give each kid one on one time,

314
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,060
because most of the time, it's both boys.

315
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,940
And they love it, and I love it,

316
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,180
but I really am trying

317
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,960
to give Calvin his one on one time,

318
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,400
Jackson his one on one time

319
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,460
and then later, both of them, you know?

320
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,960
So that's it.

321
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,820
I did not expect to cry.

322
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,060
You guys made me cry.

323
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,470
Talking out loud is crazy.

324
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,830
You guys should vlog,

325
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,240
because when you talk
your emotions out loud,

326
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,890
you'll be surprised at how you feel.

327
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,640
But that's my pregnancy update.

328
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,390
I'm a boob, I'm 24 weeks.

329
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,030
I'm looking forward to
maternity photo shoots.

330
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,460
If you guys know of any maternity dresses

331
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,030
that are white, let me know.

332
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,930
I can't really find any that I love

333
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,030
and that I feel would be pretty,

334
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,830
because a lot of them are just tube tops,

335
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,910
which I don't really love.

336
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,030
I think it's more
flattering with something.

337
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,850
Anyway, let me know.

338
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,260
Thank you guys for watching.

339
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,080
We are gonna have a heck of a weekend

340
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:54,913
with the boys.

341
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:56,400
We are going to party with them,

342
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,760
so stay tuned for that.

343
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,030
And we'll see you guys next time.

344
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,190
Don't forget to check
out my new Bollie website

345
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,070
in the description

346
00:13:03,070 --> 00:00:00,000
and we'll see you next time guys, bye.
