1
00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:04,328
- Alright, we have our favorite beverages.

2
00:00:04,328 --> 00:00:07,064
- Cheers!

3
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:07,897
So today--

4
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:08,841
- You gotta drink it!

5
00:00:08,841 --> 00:00:10,521
- Oh, sorry, that's the
whole point of cheers.

6
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,618
Let's try it again.

7
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:14,535
(both) Cheers.

8
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:15,525
(exhales)

9
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:16,495
(laughing)

10
00:00:16,495 --> 00:00:19,028
It's been two years, over two years,

11
00:00:19,028 --> 00:00:22,238
since we started planning to buy a house.

12
00:00:22,238 --> 00:00:25,374
And now we have lived in
here for over one year.

13
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:27,623
That just boggles my mind.

14
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:28,607
- It went fast.

15
00:00:28,607 --> 00:00:29,747
- Yeah, it's crazy.

16
00:00:29,747 --> 00:00:33,343
So we wanted to do a Q
and A about the house,

17
00:00:33,343 --> 00:00:36,304
the building process, and the
things that go along with it,

18
00:00:36,304 --> 00:00:39,499
and so a few days ago, well
I guess by now, a while ago,

19
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:42,387
we asked you to ask us
questions about the house

20
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:43,642
and we're gonna answer them.

21
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:44,475
- Totally.

22
00:00:44,475 --> 00:00:46,344
We tried to answer
questions along the way.

23
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:49,374
I filmed several videos
on my channel kind of,

24
00:00:49,374 --> 00:00:52,343
the fun process of us
picking out tile and carpet

25
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,359
and so this will be nice to,

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,472
now that we've been in the
house, to answer some questions.

27
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:59,026
- We'll have that playlist linked

28
00:00:59,026 --> 00:01:00,492
in the description down below.

29
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:01,997
It's all on Ellie's channel.

30
00:01:01,997 --> 00:01:03,054
Can we just note real quick,

31
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:05,812
you're sitting on your
feet, so I'm gonna try--

32
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:08,326
- And I'm kinda slouching, but
I just wanna be comfortable.

33
00:01:08,326 --> 00:01:10,219
- I'm just tryin' to be a
little bit taller than you--

34
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:11,052
- Is that okay?

35
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:12,537
It's cold in here.

36
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:13,486
(mumbling)

37
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:14,903
So what the first question is,

38
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:16,949
I love your house, thank you,

39
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:19,165
I love the layout and
how you've decorated it.

40
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:20,670
When I followed the building process,

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,175
I remember being surprised how much wood

42
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:24,598
they used to build it.

43
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,418
Is it normal to build like that in Utah

44
00:01:26,418 --> 00:01:28,167
or did you choose a wood house?

45
00:01:28,167 --> 00:01:30,596
Love your vlogs, from Nina from Denmark.

46
00:01:30,596 --> 00:01:33,424
- Well, that's actually a
question that we got a ton

47
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:34,975
during the building process.

48
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:36,896
We answered it a few
times in the comments,

49
00:01:36,896 --> 00:01:39,184
but just to kinda go over it,

50
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,221
depending on where you live in the world,

51
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:42,292
depending on the climate,

52
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:44,747
there's different building processes.

53
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:46,402
I am not a foreman.

54
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:48,161
I'm not a construction
worker so I don't know

55
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,745
all of the details with it, but,

56
00:01:49,745 --> 00:01:52,216
for example, in California,
you're roofing material

57
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:54,195
is different than here in Utah.

58
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:56,694
But for the most part, the
climate that we live in,

59
00:01:56,694 --> 00:02:00,621
most of the houses in
Utah, Washington, Idaho,

60
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,745
are built from wood mostly.

61
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:07,270
- Yep, that was very normal and so when we

62
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,788
would see those comments,
I think it opened our eyes

63
00:02:09,788 --> 00:02:13,034
to be like, we do have
a very wide audience

64
00:02:13,034 --> 00:02:14,632
that's all over the world.

65
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,717
This is so foreign to some people,

66
00:02:16,717 --> 00:02:19,655
when it was so normal to us, you know?

67
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:21,637
- I mean, some houses
are made out of brick.

68
00:02:21,637 --> 00:02:23,737
You'll drive down the road
and you'll see brick houses,

69
00:02:23,737 --> 00:02:25,714
but for the most part, it's wood.

70
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:28,111
And I think that's just
more cost-effective.

71
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:29,983
We don't have a lot of
wildfires here in Utah,

72
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,785
so I don't think that's a huge concern.

73
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,785
And I know that's something
that people brought up too.

74
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,206
So our next question is,

75
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,732
Are you planning on doing something else

76
00:02:37,732 --> 00:02:40,484
with the playroom when the kids grow up?

77
00:02:40,484 --> 00:02:44,338
The option is there to
do something different.

78
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:47,334
So that wall opposite of the kids' room,

79
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,825
where we have shelving,

80
00:02:48,825 --> 00:02:51,016
is actually plumbed for a kitchenette.

81
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:52,758
We didn't want the kitchenette
while the kids were there

82
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,371
because we didn't want
them playing with water

83
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:56,745
or anything while they're
playing downstairs.

84
00:02:56,745 --> 00:02:59,306
So it's plumbed for it, so
when the kids are older,

85
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,892
we can have a kitchenette there,

86
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:02,504
kind of like a half kitchen.

87
00:03:02,504 --> 00:03:03,832
- Maybe get a foosball table?

88
00:03:03,832 --> 00:03:07,598
- Yeah, just have it more
of like an adult playroom?

89
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:08,431
- Yeah.

90
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:09,427
- Does that sound appropriate?

91
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:10,388
- Yeah, totally.

92
00:03:10,388 --> 00:03:12,744
Somethin' for the teenagers to play in.

93
00:03:12,744 --> 00:03:14,527
Yeah, and for us.

94
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,355
But I think eventually we'll even take out

95
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:20,929
that wall space that has
all of the kids' toys in it

96
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:23,010
in years to come and it--

97
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:23,843
- The shelving?

98
00:03:23,843 --> 00:03:26,006
- Yeah and be just a fun,

99
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,714
I mean it already is
a fun open area as is,

100
00:03:28,714 --> 00:03:30,291
but just to give us even more space,

101
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,587
we could put a few--

102
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,578
- Like a ping pong table?

103
00:03:34,578 --> 00:03:35,503
- Yeah!

104
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:36,766
- Do you remember that?

105
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:40,193
- I think people gave me
a lot of crap for that

106
00:03:40,193 --> 00:03:42,117
because they thought I was saying no.

107
00:03:42,117 --> 00:03:43,325
- Yeah.

108
00:03:43,325 --> 00:03:44,764
- You always put that on me!

109
00:03:44,764 --> 00:03:46,571
- I did, and I feel terrible about that.

110
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,268
- We can get a stupid ping pong table!

111
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:49,226
- We can get a ping pong table.

112
00:03:49,226 --> 00:03:50,226
It just doesn't make sense

113
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:52,037
when the kids are that little, to do it.

114
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,553
'Cause that's their play area.

115
00:03:53,553 --> 00:03:54,586
- I just don't know if
we'd play with it tons.

116
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:56,858
- Yeah, I would, but (laughs).

117
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:58,789
- We can get a ping pong table!

118
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:01,035
- I am giving her a hard time.

119
00:04:01,035 --> 00:04:03,400
Please don't give her one too.

120
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,611
- Who did your painting,
your extra large painting

121
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:08,041
in the living room upstairs?

122
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:10,816
That was my friend that
lives in the neighborhood

123
00:04:10,816 --> 00:04:14,520
and her name is ChelsMade on Instagram.

124
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,757
And I will have her in the description.

125
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:19,397
- Super talented artist.

126
00:04:19,397 --> 00:04:20,469
- Love her!

127
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,247
She's my really good friend.

128
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:24,643
What special tweaks
did you add to the home

129
00:04:24,643 --> 00:04:27,226
that you never use?

130
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:31,153
- Well, I mean, that
secret room in the attic,

131
00:04:31,153 --> 00:04:32,611
did we tell them about that?

132
00:04:32,611 --> 00:04:34,180
I'm kidding, no we didn't do anything.

133
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,422
Because we made it the way that we wanted,

134
00:04:37,422 --> 00:04:38,760
we've used everything.

135
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,706
Like the half-wall in our bathroom,

136
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,063
the toilet in the laundry room,

137
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,849
which I guess it's controversial (laughs).

138
00:04:43,849 --> 00:04:45,385
- Yeah, that was interesting.

139
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:47,589
- Which is totally normal for everyone--

140
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:48,906
- Here.
- Here, yeah.

141
00:04:48,906 --> 00:04:52,561
- The things that we tweaked
is pretty much what we use.

142
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:55,063
I guess the one thing
maybe we don't use as much

143
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:58,896
is in our pantry, I had
that little half-wall.

144
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:03,550
But I like it because it still holds

145
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,363
my mixers and everything.

146
00:05:05,363 --> 00:05:07,670
So I would say we don't use that space.

147
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,727
I thought I would go in and use stuff,

148
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:11,578
which I do with the toaster, but--

149
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,520
- It's not like a preparation
area like you thought.

150
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,432
It's mostly just like a storage area.

151
00:05:16,432 --> 00:05:18,216
- I never thought I was gonna prep there.

152
00:05:18,216 --> 00:05:19,704
And a lot of people
were like, That's silly.

153
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:21,760
But I never said I was gonna prep there.

154
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,603
It was just to hold cooking pans

155
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:25,091
if tons of people came over.

156
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,439
Yeah, it does that.

157
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,813
- So maybe that's the spot.

158
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:28,646
- I guess.

159
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:31,275
- What was the hardest part
about building your house?

160
00:05:31,275 --> 00:05:34,006
And what is your favorite room in it?

161
00:05:34,006 --> 00:05:36,546
So the hardest part, for me, anyway,

162
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,163
and it's not something that I really had

163
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,747
a ton of control with,

164
00:05:39,747 --> 00:05:43,055
is making sure that the
different contractors

165
00:05:43,055 --> 00:05:45,339
did their job on schedule.

166
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,907
We got pushed back a little
bit, due to weather, I mean,

167
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:50,857
things that happen.
- Normal stuff.

168
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:52,141
- And we understand,

169
00:05:52,141 --> 00:05:53,360
I would say that was the hardest part

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,477
is because when it was getting
into winter time, or October,

171
00:05:57,477 --> 00:06:00,163
we were like, Okay, we
may be able to get grass

172
00:06:00,163 --> 00:06:03,926
if we're a week or two
early than we are now,

173
00:06:03,926 --> 00:06:06,231
which is still behind schedule.

174
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:08,639
I think that was the hardest part for me.

175
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,035
- And hearing a lot of people that build,

176
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,767
which is totally normal, but I do think

177
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:15,677
that's hard for the other people as well

178
00:06:15,677 --> 00:06:17,140
because they're just so excited.

179
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,067
- Absolutely.

180
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,519
- My neighbor, she just moved in,

181
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,975
but it took them about four
months longer than they thought

182
00:06:23,975 --> 00:06:25,809
and that was due to weather, materials,

183
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:28,010
so kinda stuff that's
out of your hands anyway,

184
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,092
but just, it's hard on your family.

185
00:06:30,092 --> 00:06:32,164
She has a family of five, so.

186
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:34,044
- These things happen and
they're to be expected,

187
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:35,571
but it doesn't mean they're not difficult.

188
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,496
- I think the hardest part for me was,

189
00:06:37,496 --> 00:06:39,903
it was just one incident,
and it was one contractor,

190
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:43,184
I was just trying to convey what I wanted

191
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:47,372
and them having a hard time
picturing what I wanted.

192
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:51,167
Like how the layout would
be of tile, or something.

193
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:53,085
That was the hard part for me.

194
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:54,638
But other than that, the communication

195
00:06:54,638 --> 00:06:57,821
was actually pretty smooth for
us and I really enjoyed that.

196
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:59,789
Alright, what is your favorite room?

197
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:00,622
- Oooh.

198
00:07:00,622 --> 00:07:02,412
I mean, obviously I have a
special place in my heart

199
00:07:02,412 --> 00:07:04,819
for my office, because I
spend so much time in there.

200
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:06,581
But really, when you walk into the house

201
00:07:06,581 --> 00:07:08,405
and you just see the
living room and the kitchen

202
00:07:08,405 --> 00:07:09,964
and the dining, the great room.

203
00:07:09,964 --> 00:07:11,591
I think that's my favorite.

204
00:07:11,591 --> 00:07:15,045
- I would say the room that
I spend the most time in,

205
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:17,844
aside from the kitchen,
is definitely our bedroom.

206
00:07:17,844 --> 00:07:20,908
I think one of the kids'
favorite rooms as well.

207
00:07:20,908 --> 00:07:22,647
They each have toys in their room.

208
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,846
But I have a little bit of toys in my room

209
00:07:24,846 --> 00:07:27,558
that they play with and
I like cuddling in bed

210
00:07:27,558 --> 00:07:30,256
and watching shows with them.

211
00:07:30,256 --> 00:07:33,633
The tub, the kids love
taking baths in my big tub.

212
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,423
So I would say my bedroom
is probably my favorite spot

213
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:38,910
in the room, (correcting self) house.

214
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:42,093
- This question is for
the house and Penny, ooh!

215
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:44,203
How are the floors holding
up having a big dog

216
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:46,158
like a lab in the house running all over.

217
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:48,931
Do they get scratched
or messed up a bunch?

218
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:51,011
Well, so that's, it's
funny that you ask that

219
00:07:51,011 --> 00:07:52,880
because we just spoke with the person

220
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,915
who did our hardwood
floors and we're noticing

221
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:58,139
that the coating is just not holding up

222
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,557
the way that we wanted it to.

223
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:01,582
There's some splits down the lines.

224
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:05,412
And I'm not sure if that's to
say because of Penny solely.

225
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:08,476
But I think that has,
definitely, some part to it.

226
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:11,227
You know that we take off
our shoes in our house

227
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:15,294
so I feel like we're not that
crazy with the hardwood floors

228
00:08:15,294 --> 00:08:17,725
but we're definitely ready for a new seal.

229
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:19,107
So we're gonna be doing that as soon

230
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,859
as we get back from our trip, actually.

231
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:23,099
- Yeah, with Penny, with
the wood floors though,

232
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:26,551
there are definitely scratches on them.

233
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:29,828
We have some protectors
that protect the bar stools

234
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:31,486
from sliding, so it's smooth.

235
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,318
- Same with the couches.

236
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:34,264
- Same with the couches,
but there's definitely

237
00:08:34,265 --> 00:08:36,042
scratches from Penny's nails.

238
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,654
And I think, honestly,
it's not really Penny

239
00:08:39,654 --> 00:08:41,568
that has scratched them up as much.

240
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:44,269
I think the hardest thing
that happened with the house

241
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,146
was when we, we weren't able
to get the yard in first.

242
00:08:48,146 --> 00:08:52,653
And so there was a lot
of dirt and mud and snow

243
00:08:52,653 --> 00:08:56,533
and even rock that was in
the house in the winter

244
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,093
and then along having
a dog running around.

245
00:08:59,093 --> 00:09:02,222
That kinda scratched up
the floors quite a bit.

246
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:05,814
So I think that's where most
of the damage has come from,

247
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,640
was just not from a finished yard,

248
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,707
lots of dirt, lots of coming in and out.

249
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:12,600
So we are gonna get it
sanded and resealed,

250
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,997
though, this month.

251
00:09:13,997 --> 00:09:15,664
- Which I think will be really nice.

252
00:09:15,664 --> 00:09:16,721
Smooth sealing.

253
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:17,554
- Oh yeah.

254
00:09:17,554 --> 00:09:19,224
- What is your favorite memory

255
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:22,088
in the new house from the past year?

256
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:24,748
- I would have to say Christmas.

257
00:09:24,748 --> 00:09:27,115
Because I've always kind of envisioned

258
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:29,616
just my own family in my home,

259
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:33,462
and it was really special and romantic.

260
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:37,201
- It's a bucket list
dream come true experience

261
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,623
that you get to have.

262
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:40,224
Mine is very similar.

263
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:41,287
Same timeline.

264
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:44,686
I think one of my favorite
memories is when we got Penny.

265
00:09:44,686 --> 00:09:45,583
- Aww, yes.

266
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:47,397
Made our house a home.
- That was very sweet.

267
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,412
Yeah exactly.

268
00:09:48,412 --> 00:09:49,693
- You guys wanna come in?

269
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,247
- Do you wanna come in?

270
00:09:51,247 --> 00:09:52,512
- (mimicking) Yeah.

271
00:09:52,512 --> 00:09:54,319
- Alright, this next
question, I'm not gonna go

272
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:57,748
into huge details because I
already have a video on it,

273
00:09:57,748 --> 00:09:59,676
but it talks about what
it was like working

274
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:01,280
with the contractor and builders?

275
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,043
Did you search awhile to find one?

276
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:04,762
We knew what builder we wanted,

277
00:10:04,762 --> 00:10:07,119
but we also interviewed about five,

278
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:10,227
four or five other builders
before we settled with one.

279
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:12,994
That way we felt the communication,

280
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:16,623
each building process has
different price ranges,

281
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:17,477
so yeah.

282
00:10:17,477 --> 00:10:19,546
But I do have a video
specifically on that.

283
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:21,437
And we really enjoyed working with

284
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,458
the contractors and the builder.

285
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:25,895
I think that they respected
us and we respected them

286
00:10:25,895 --> 00:10:28,527
and it was a very, very smooth process.

287
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,432
- Absolutely.

288
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:32,210
Do you think it's more,
less, or equally as expensive

289
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,939
to build a house rather
than to buy a house?

290
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:36,272
So with us,

291
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:37,861
whoa.

292
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:41,102
With us and our situation,
we actually looked at that.

293
00:10:41,102 --> 00:10:43,734
Yeah, where we live, that's
a huge factor into the cost

294
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:45,464
of housing, is where you live.

295
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:48,846
Housing is not terribly expensive in Utah.

296
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:51,234
So when we looked into building,

297
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,895
we looked at buying houses
and building houses.

298
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:56,420
The cost was not that different.

299
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,891
It was very similar to build
a house or buy a house.

300
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,508
So we thought why not build a house

301
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:01,751
if it's gonna be about the same

302
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:02,954
and we'll get exactly what we want.

303
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:05,832
- Yeah, we did find a
house that we really loved.

304
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,698
The back yard was beautiful,

305
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:10,756
the setup of the house was
fairly similar to this.

306
00:11:10,756 --> 00:11:12,330
- The neighborhood was amazing.

307
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,804
- We really liked it
and we were very close

308
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:16,234
to putting an offer on it,

309
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:19,233
but it was a little further
away than we wanted it to be.

310
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,710
And the price was very similar to this.

311
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,194
(cute babbling)

312
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:26,153
And we thought that it
would just be fun as well,

313
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:28,503
to build, and to have that experience.

314
00:11:28,503 --> 00:11:29,336
- Absolutely.

315
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,827
- So that's why we ended
up choosing building.

316
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:32,726
And I like it--

317
00:11:32,726 --> 00:11:34,828
- I would never go back.

318
00:11:34,828 --> 00:11:36,476
(cute babbling)

319
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,878
- What was the easiest part
of designing your own home?

320
00:11:39,878 --> 00:11:42,566
- It was easy because
we went to the builder,

321
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:46,368
we said we want an open
concept, we need an office,

322
00:11:46,368 --> 00:11:49,310
we need at least three or four bedrooms,

323
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,538
and he pulled up 10 house plans

324
00:11:51,538 --> 00:11:54,206
and he said, Well I like
this and I like this,

325
00:11:54,206 --> 00:11:56,008
this is a newer house plan,

326
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,562
I think you'll like this the most.

327
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,550
We looked at it, we went
and looked at the house

328
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,350
that he built that house plan on

329
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,568
and I was like, Yeah I love it.

330
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:04,417
So that, I mean it was really easy.

331
00:12:04,417 --> 00:12:07,281
It's not like we started from scratch

332
00:12:07,281 --> 00:12:12,129
and really laid out the house
ourselves with a contractor.

333
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:13,276
He just had house plans.

334
00:12:13,276 --> 00:12:15,275
- He had house plans
that looked really nice.

335
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:18,012
- And that's how all the
builders that we interviewed,

336
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,199
how it was, you could do your own.

337
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:22,238
- But they have floor plans
that you can choose from

338
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:23,757
just to make it easier.

339
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:24,789
(babbling)

340
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:27,122
- Are there any more rooms
or spaces in the house

341
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,883
that you thought you would've
used more but haven't?

342
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,814
Definitely, a lot of the
space we haven't fully used

343
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:34,587
because we're still a young family.

344
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,034
We haven't quite grown into the house.

345
00:12:37,034 --> 00:12:39,728
But I would definitely say
space we don't use as much,

346
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:40,818
Oh heavens no! (laughing)

347
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:42,540
- I'm trying to get him to cheers with me.

348
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,431
- (laughing) Oh!

349
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:44,762
I thought you were giving him that.

350
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:45,595
- Cheers.

351
00:12:45,595 --> 00:12:48,404
- But a space that we don't use

352
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,281
as much as I thought we would

353
00:12:50,281 --> 00:12:52,260
is actually the basement.

354
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,093
- Yeah.

355
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,342
- The play area.

356
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:56,064
I felt like we would be down there more.

357
00:12:56,064 --> 00:12:57,408
We definitely use it,

358
00:12:57,408 --> 00:13:01,637
but the kids really like to
still be by Jared and I a lot,

359
00:13:01,637 --> 00:13:04,436
and so they're often upstairs with us.

360
00:13:04,436 --> 00:13:07,606
If I'm in the kitchen, the
kids are with me cookin'.

361
00:13:07,606 --> 00:13:10,337
If I'm getting ready, the
kids are in my bathroom.

362
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:11,500
- They just like us

363
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,049
and I'm not sure why.
- I don't know why!

364
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:13,882
(laughing)

365
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:14,971
- Yeah, so they like to follow us around.

366
00:13:14,971 --> 00:13:16,522
- Why do you like me?

367
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:18,772
(babbling)

368
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:21,954
It's 'cause I give you chocolate milk?

369
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:22,787
- Yeah!

370
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:23,620
- Oh!

371
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,769
- That's a pretty good reason.

372
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,675
Were there any ideas that
you had for the house

373
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:30,317
that you really wanted but
didn't make the cut in the end?

374
00:13:30,317 --> 00:13:33,100
- There was a few things
that would've been fun,

375
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,043
but wasn't a necessity.

376
00:13:36,043 --> 00:13:38,292
We thought about doing some
water features in the back

377
00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,460
because we do have a lot of rock work.

378
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,852
The price of water features--

379
00:13:41,852 --> 00:13:42,685
- They're expensive.

380
00:13:42,685 --> 00:13:43,973
- Are even more expensive than,

381
00:13:43,973 --> 00:13:46,424
I mean the rock work alone
can be really expensive,

382
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:48,922
bringing in rocks, so we
decided not to do that.

383
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:50,662
Even, we even thought about maybe building

384
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,580
a space for me to cut the boys' hair.

385
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,657
You know, a sink, and I
wish we would have done it,

386
00:13:56,657 --> 00:13:59,216
in a way, 'cause it would
have been very convenient.

387
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,454
- But it hasn't been like,

388
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,373
Oh I really wish we would've had this.

389
00:14:02,373 --> 00:14:03,963
- But we don't, we haven't,

390
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:07,312
it's been okay not having
a sink to cut their hair.

391
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:10,354
So they would've been fun,
but those are things we just,

392
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:11,418
didn't make the cut.

393
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,734
How did you guys start
saving for your house?

394
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,619
I am still in college.

395
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,733
- So, what we did,

396
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,387
and from the beginning of our marriage,

397
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:22,642
we've always had a budget
and we stick to that budget

398
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,523
as much as we possibly can.

399
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:27,148
So we have a car fund,
we have a house fund,

400
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,261
and every month that we--

401
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:29,219
- We have a clothing fund.

402
00:14:29,219 --> 00:14:30,675
- Yeah, all these different categories.

403
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:33,146
It's like the envelope
system, so it's very similar.

404
00:14:33,146 --> 00:14:33,979
- But in our bank.

405
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:35,921
We don't really do the
envelope cash system.

406
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:37,827
- Yeah, we do it within our bank.

407
00:14:37,827 --> 00:14:39,200
But every month we got paid,

408
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,704
we put some money into the car fund

409
00:14:40,704 --> 00:14:42,342
and we put some money into the house fund,

410
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:43,744
and then once we got to the point

411
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:47,740
where we could put a down
payment on the lot, the house,

412
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,252
that's what we did.

413
00:14:49,252 --> 00:14:51,714
And some months, those
envelopes got different amounts.

414
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:53,941
Some months we only put
20 bucks in that folder,

415
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:56,369
but as much as we could, we did.

416
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,785
And it got to the point where we,

417
00:14:58,785 --> 00:15:00,581
when we moved to where we are,

418
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:02,320
the city where we are now,

419
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,726
we wanted to get a home,
but we weren't ready for it.

420
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:06,193
So we actually waited another year,

421
00:15:06,193 --> 00:15:08,867
saved up a little bit more
to do, to what we did.

422
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,323
- To kind of look for the area too,

423
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:11,235
that took a minute.

424
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:12,113
- Yeah, takes some time.

425
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:13,614
- Was there one issue or fight

426
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:15,575
y'all had about the design of the house

427
00:15:15,575 --> 00:15:17,737
during the building or decorating process?

428
00:15:17,737 --> 00:15:20,254
I would say, for the most part...

429
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:21,087
- No.

430
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,383
- We pretty much agreed on everything.

431
00:15:23,383 --> 00:15:24,878
I mean there is, of course,
things where it's like,

432
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,367
No I really like that or I like that

433
00:15:26,367 --> 00:15:28,323
but it wasn't a drug out fight of like,

434
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:29,616
No I wanted that!

435
00:15:29,616 --> 00:15:31,381
- It's gonna be this way or no way.

436
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:36,152
- Yeah and honestly this
goes into a bigger picture.

437
00:15:36,152 --> 00:15:38,742
From the very beginning when
Jared and I got married,

438
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:42,733
we talked about money,
finances, sex, kids, church

439
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,426
before we got married.

440
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:46,165
And then we got married and we talked

441
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:48,976
about our goals and plans.

442
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,951
Every time we have something,

443
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:55,086
we really try hard to talk
about it before it even happens.

444
00:15:55,086 --> 00:15:58,029
Like right now, we've talked
about disciplining our kids

445
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:01,111
before we had kids, so that
we were on the same page.

446
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:04,904
- We made the decisions
before we got to the question,

447
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:06,190
if that makes sense.

448
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,880
So we knew what we wanted in
the house, in the designs,

449
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,432
before we even got to the design part.

450
00:16:12,432 --> 00:16:14,392
Then there were some finite details like,

451
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,977
well there's this small change
here, small change there,

452
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,424
but in the great scheme of things,

453
00:16:19,424 --> 00:16:20,851
well that, the whole
design is what we wanted

454
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:22,456
so it made it easy.

455
00:16:22,456 --> 00:16:23,289
- Yeah.

456
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:25,477
And that is something that, I think,

457
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:27,690
could help a lot of people out.

458
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,694
And that's definitely not us

459
00:16:29,694 --> 00:16:31,848
being smart, young kids at the time.

460
00:16:31,848 --> 00:16:35,587
Our parents had a huge impact
on that by teaching us.

461
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:37,325
But I think that really does help

462
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,287
in every type of relationship.

463
00:16:39,287 --> 00:16:42,852
Just expectations, talk about
things before they happen,

464
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,472
and I think that goes a long way.

465
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:48,154
- Question about the house,
is it energy efficient?

466
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,419
Does it keep you warm when you need it

467
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,575
and cool when you need it?

468
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,437
- Yes, and I think that has part to do,

469
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:54,087
we have a Smart thermostat.

470
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:56,903
So it gives us a good range
to keep the house between,

471
00:16:56,903 --> 00:17:00,408
so it's not always
cooling or always heating.

472
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:01,554
It does a good job.

473
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,500
And I've actually noticed our energy bill

474
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,673
has gone down quite a bit
just by installing that.

475
00:17:06,673 --> 00:17:07,506
- Yeah.

476
00:17:07,506 --> 00:17:08,569
I talked to Bonnie the other night

477
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,031
'cause she had spent the
night and she was like,

478
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,875
Your house is very well insulated.

479
00:17:12,876 --> 00:17:15,685
And it's a newer home,
so I do think it does

480
00:17:15,685 --> 00:17:18,053
stay warmer when it needs to, and cooler,

481
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:20,564
because of the way it's
insulated 'cause it's newer.

482
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:23,278
She just talked about how
her home isn't quite that way

483
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:24,619
'cause it's a little older.

484
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:28,184
So I think just because
it is newer, it does.

485
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:30,339
- Keep the temperature.

486
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,589
I might be wrong, but
there's a second story

487
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:35,685
"nook" thing above your
house, above your office.

488
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:37,679
I've wondered about it
since you started building.

489
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:38,993
Does it have a purpose?

490
00:17:38,993 --> 00:17:42,559
So that is my secret room that I mentioned

491
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,144
earlier in the video.

492
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:45,770
I don't show the inside of it.

493
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:48,156
I don't want anyone to
see what goes in there

494
00:17:48,156 --> 00:17:49,963
because it's very private
video game playing.

495
00:17:49,963 --> 00:17:50,880
I mean, shoot!

496
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,075
I've given away too much.

497
00:17:52,075 --> 00:17:53,894
No, it's just aesthetics.

498
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,977
The windows are blacked out.

499
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:58,038
It's just the attic, is really what it is.

500
00:17:58,038 --> 00:17:59,486
- And I've never been in the attic.

501
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:00,319
You went in there--

502
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,808
- I did.
- And Jackson went in there.

503
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:03,051
I've never been in the attic.

504
00:18:03,051 --> 00:18:05,944
- What made you decide to live
in Utah other than family?

505
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:07,554
Thank you for sharing your daily life.

506
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:08,639
Awe, thank you so much.

507
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:11,290
Honestly, family has had
a huge factor into that.

508
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,763
Lots of my side of the family

509
00:18:12,763 --> 00:18:14,459
and Ellie's side of the
family lives in Utah,

510
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:15,997
so we can't just let that go

511
00:18:15,997 --> 00:18:17,694
and say the family hasn't had a big part.

512
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:18,527
It has.

513
00:18:18,527 --> 00:18:20,346
- Yeah, I would definitely say so.

514
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:23,453
And I think the living.

515
00:18:23,453 --> 00:18:27,180
I think it's a good price to live here.

516
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,081
I think if it wasn't here, I
think Texas is a good place.

517
00:18:31,081 --> 00:18:33,421
There's places that we've
visited that we've been like,

518
00:18:33,421 --> 00:18:36,222
we could totally see
ourselves living here.

519
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:37,761
But then, every time we come back,

520
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:40,822
there's something about the
Utah mountains that keep us.

521
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:42,442
It just feels like home.

522
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,275
I dunno.

523
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:44,799
Maybe one day we'll go crazy and just say

524
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,449
let's pack up and go.

525
00:18:46,449 --> 00:18:47,570
- To New Zealand.

526
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:48,403
Done, 'kay.

527
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:49,366
- We want to visit there.

528
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,199
We will.

529
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,979
We have places we want to
visit, but still young family.

530
00:18:52,979 --> 00:18:54,510
We've been lots of places.

531
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,364
- Yes we have.

532
00:18:55,364 --> 00:18:57,050
It's been a blessing.

533
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,847
- Are you using the dog wash area

534
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,402
as much as you thought you would?

535
00:19:01,402 --> 00:19:04,473
- I would say yes.

536
00:19:04,473 --> 00:19:06,827
I mean, I use it for more
than just the dog wash.

537
00:19:06,827 --> 00:19:07,918
And that's kind of a purpose.

538
00:19:07,918 --> 00:19:10,363
It's just like, when we
get muddy and everything,

539
00:19:10,363 --> 00:19:12,937
that's where we take our
boots and spray 'em off.

540
00:19:12,937 --> 00:19:14,083
So yeah.

541
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,654
And the little hose
thing that we have there

542
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,045
has been really nice to have.

543
00:19:17,045 --> 00:19:19,474
- It's been more used for not the dog.

544
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:20,724
(laughing)

545
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:23,181
We've used it for a car, carpets,

546
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:26,139
we've used it for the kids
when Jared goes four-wheeling,

547
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:28,721
muddy boots, and we've
used it quite a bit.

548
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:31,256
I thought we would use
it more for the dog.

549
00:19:31,256 --> 00:19:34,742
I thought it was gonna be
built a little differently.

550
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:36,590
And this is something that we could,

551
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,943
we are planning on doing, is having it be

552
00:19:38,943 --> 00:19:40,954
more of an enclosed area.

553
00:19:40,954 --> 00:19:44,455
Because water splashes
all over the cabinet.

554
00:19:44,455 --> 00:19:47,423
So that was hard when we
had bathed Penny in there.

555
00:19:47,423 --> 00:19:50,089
So I definitely know that that's
something that we wanna do,

556
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,622
probably this year, is--

557
00:19:51,622 --> 00:19:52,754
- Gotta build it up a little more.

558
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:55,107
- Yeah, have some walls on it.

559
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,417
But it has been used.

560
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:59,061
Not the purpose we thought as much.

561
00:19:59,061 --> 00:19:59,894
- Yeah.

562
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:01,985
- Penny's probably showered
in our shower more.

563
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,348
- More than (laughs).

564
00:20:03,348 --> 00:20:06,564
Well that is our house Q and A.

565
00:20:06,564 --> 00:20:08,595
We've loved being here for the year.

566
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:09,893
We've learned a lot.

567
00:20:09,893 --> 00:20:12,038
And hopefully we've been able to show you

568
00:20:12,038 --> 00:20:14,253
some of that with these questions.

569
00:20:14,253 --> 00:20:16,890
Thank you so much for taking
the time to ask these questions

570
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,723
- And to watch.

571
00:20:17,723 --> 00:20:20,343
- And to watch and that is
gonna be it from us today.

572
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,166
So thank you so much for watching.

573
00:20:22,166 --> 00:00:00,000
See you tomorrow, bye!
