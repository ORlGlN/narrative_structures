1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
(bright bluesy music)

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:01,820
- Woo!

3
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:03,891
- [Jared] Yeah.

4
00:00:03,891 --> 00:00:05,974
Put your arms in the air.

5
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:17,711
Happy Monday, happy Monday Penny.

6
00:00:18,945 --> 00:00:21,105
Good morning, how are ya?

7
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,193
That's a good girl.

8
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:23,929
You're so excited for Monday.

9
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:27,089
May we all have the energy
of a one year old dog.

10
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:28,518
(laughs)

11
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:31,101
She is just so spunky and happy

12
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:33,975
just uh, what a good girl.

13
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:36,478
Looking outside, is Calvin
and Jackson out there?

14
00:00:36,478 --> 00:00:37,348
Are they playing?

15
00:00:37,348 --> 00:00:38,198
Are they riding their bikes?

16
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:39,473
They've been riding their bikes

17
00:00:39,473 --> 00:00:40,767
maybe because it's a little warmer today.

18
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,399
It's a beautiful beautiful day.

19
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:43,340
So I think we're gonna take advantage

20
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,088
of the beautiful day
and spend time outside.

21
00:00:46,088 --> 00:00:49,255
(bright groovy music)

22
00:00:55,427 --> 00:00:57,035
- [Ellie] Well hello boys.

23
00:00:57,035 --> 00:00:58,042
- Hey hi.

24
00:00:58,042 --> 00:00:59,207
- [Ellie] Whatcha doin'?

25
00:00:59,207 --> 00:01:00,387
- Oh I'm just

26
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,207
Landon needed some help, so he called me

27
00:01:02,207 --> 00:01:03,290
to come over.

28
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:05,974
- Usually people call Joel,

29
00:01:05,974 --> 00:01:07,277
because he puts holes in peoples' walls.

30
00:01:07,277 --> 00:01:10,365
- And cuts himself up, it's ridiculous.

31
00:01:10,365 --> 00:01:13,115
- We are somewhere new having fun

32
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:16,637
and eating fruit snacks with our cousins.

33
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,015
- If you're ready to
have a good time today,

34
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:18,941
raise your hands.

35
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:19,941
- [All] Woo!

36
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:22,542
- If you're ready to
go to a pumpkin patch,

37
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:23,534
raise your hand.

38
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:24,617
- Woo.
- I am.

39
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,855
- [Jared] If you're ready to
have a good time, say oh yeah.

40
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,417
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah.

41
00:01:29,417 --> 00:01:30,334
- Let's go!

42
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:33,463
So every year around Halloween,

43
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:34,695
we got to a place called Cornbelly's

44
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,397
and there's so many fun things to do

45
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:37,812
for the kids and for us.

46
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:39,468
If you remember, that's
where I went bull riding.

47
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:40,301
I got hurt.

48
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,488
But we got everyone here.

49
00:01:41,488 --> 00:01:43,615
They opened 20 minutes ago

50
00:01:43,615 --> 00:01:46,711
and two overflow parking lots are full.

51
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:47,903
It is crazy.

52
00:01:47,903 --> 00:01:49,791
On Mondays in Utah it's family night,

53
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:51,849
so all these families
like to do stuff together.

54
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,364
And tonight is the night,
so there's a ton of people.

55
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,573
We're gonna have a blast.

56
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,428
We're gonna play, we're gonna have fun.

57
00:01:57,428 --> 00:01:58,609
You guys ready to rock?

58
00:01:58,609 --> 00:02:00,760
- Woo hoo!
- Yeah.

59
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,927
(bright bluesy music)

60
00:02:24,086 --> 00:02:26,630
You and Julie are going
up with all the kids?

61
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,463
Good luck.

62
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:38,797
- Woo!

63
00:02:38,797 --> 00:02:40,587
- [Jared] Yeah.

64
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,218
You almost got some air.

65
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:44,968
(Jared laughing)

66
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:07,954
Woo hoo!

67
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,712
Yeah!

68
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:11,840
- [Ellie] Julie!

69
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,423
(Ellie laughs)

70
00:03:15,372 --> 00:03:16,602
- The mama.

71
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,071
- Hey when I saw you and Julie up there,

72
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:19,491
I thought, oh, that's what they look like

73
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,889
on a date.

74
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:22,153
- Remember that one time Julie and I

75
00:03:22,153 --> 00:03:23,453
went on a date?

76
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,370
- Yeah that was so fun.

77
00:03:26,924 --> 00:03:28,396
- There was a picture of Julie on Facebook

78
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:30,004
the other day and Calvin looked at it

79
00:03:30,004 --> 00:03:30,999
and goes Mama.

80
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:32,358
- Oh cute.
- I'm like, yeah.

81
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:35,037
- Yeah yeah Mama.
- This is fun.

82
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:36,574
- We're spending the evening with Julie,

83
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,424
we're hanging out with the kids.

84
00:03:38,424 --> 00:03:39,321
- Such a good idea.

85
00:03:39,321 --> 00:03:42,705
- And this is the biggest place here

86
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:44,131
it's called Corndolly's.

87
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:45,080
There's so many activities,

88
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,242
and we're getting ready to
go on a little train ride.

89
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,392
- [Julie] Can the adults do this?

90
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,839
- [Ellie] I don't see why not.

91
00:03:50,839 --> 00:03:52,172
You get it girl.

92
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:54,540
- Cow ride.

93
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,248
Put your hands in the air.

94
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:59,498
- Like you just don't care.

95
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:03,098
(tractor motoring)

96
00:04:03,098 --> 00:04:05,015
Look at all these cows.

97
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:06,821
- [Jared] Moo!

98
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,904
(mooing)

99
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,023
Okay man, world cup first shot,

100
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,583
I'll buy you dinner.

101
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,583
- World cup?

102
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,415
- [Jared] World cup,
the top one in the left.

103
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:24,248
Stand back Jackson,

104
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:26,361
you're about to see something amazing.

105
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:27,194
- No!

106
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,973
(Jared laughing)

107
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:32,473
- [Jared] Poise, dedication, triumph, ooh,

108
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,172
ooh, aww.

109
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:38,677
The goalie got a red card,

110
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,670
so you have a second attempt.

111
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,676
- Here we go, world cup here I come baby.

112
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:47,330
- [Jared] Ooh that was so close.

113
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,852
Oh that was not (laughing).

114
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:51,775
(slow mo' laughing)

115
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:55,942
Don't worry, we'll work on
your ball handling skills.

116
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:57,732
Oh I got academy.

117
00:04:57,732 --> 00:04:58,565
- [Landon] You got academy.

118
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,352
- [Ellie] That was good.

119
00:05:00,352 --> 00:05:02,930
Is that awesome that dad did that?

120
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,208
- Yeah.

121
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:05,720
- [Jared] Okay, kick it.

122
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,205
Yeah.

123
00:05:07,205 --> 00:05:09,042
And this is a corn maze, okay?

124
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,479
We have to try and not
get lost in the corn maze.

125
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,012
Emma, are you gonna be our guide today?

126
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,845
- No.

127
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:14,955
- [Jared] No, okay.

128
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:16,667
- She's already lost and
she's not even in the maze.

129
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,500
(Jared laughs)

130
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,650
- [Jared] Should we got
this way or this way?

131
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,483
- [Jackson] This way.

132
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:22,900
- Okay, let's go.

133
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,752
We're gonna try to sneak
and scare Aunt Julie.

134
00:05:27,752 --> 00:05:28,920
Should we do that?

135
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,753
- Yeah.

136
00:05:29,753 --> 00:05:32,586
- Oh this way, this way, this way.

137
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,703
Boogedy boogety boo!
- We're done.

138
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:37,833
(yelling)

139
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,321
- Jackson what way?

140
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:40,154
What way?

141
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:44,121
- [Jared] Calvin, where did you go.

142
00:05:44,121 --> 00:05:44,954
Calvin?

143
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:48,962
Calvin, where is he?

144
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:50,127
There you are.

145
00:05:50,127 --> 00:05:50,960
Calvin.

146
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,155
(laughing)

147
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:55,988
You got lost in the corn maze,

148
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:57,952
I couldn't find you.

149
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,535
(bright music)

150
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:19,867
- [Ellie] Let's see Jare.

151
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,282
- You want to know how you know you had

152
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:22,115
a good time at the corn?

153
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,282
- [Ellie] How?

154
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:28,141
(laughing)

155
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:29,843
- [Ellie] I don't know
what's worse, that or Lego's.

156
00:06:29,843 --> 00:06:32,676
- Calvin had just as much fun too.

157
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:35,232
It's getting a little chilly outside

158
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:37,711
and Calvin is wearing his Jacket

159
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,332
and his little hat.

160
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,276
And it it the cutest thing in the world.

161
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,330
I want to have it for myself.

162
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,163
Hi bud.

163
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:46,887
Are you gonna come down the slide?

164
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:47,847
- Boat.

165
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:50,776
- [Jared] The bell, the
boat, you're on a boat?

166
00:06:50,776 --> 00:06:51,609
- That.

167
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:54,609
- [Jared] Yeah, come down the slide.

168
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:57,794
Yeah.

169
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,352
Yeah!

170
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:04,232
(Jared laughing)

171
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:06,227
Everyone is gathered around,

172
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,154
because they are shooting off a cannon,

173
00:07:08,154 --> 00:07:10,571
full of candy, cash and toys.

174
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,993
And we're gonna try and get some, okay?

175
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,921
Are you gonna grab some Calvin?

176
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,219
Are you gonna grab some?

177
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,683
Okay.

178
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:20,957
I'm kind of nervous because
it's literally a giant cannon

179
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:24,957
shooting hard objects at
a huge group of people.

180
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,052
Cover your head, seriously.

181
00:07:27,052 --> 00:07:28,551
- They said there's like pumpkins in it?

182
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,384
- [Jared] What?

183
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,266
- Yeah like little pumpkins.

184
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:31,757
- [Jared] Oh my gosh.

185
00:07:31,757 --> 00:07:33,553
This is a little scary.
- Are we going home with

186
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,740
- black eyes and bloody noses and stuff?

187
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,759
- [Jared] Yeah.

188
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,258
(yelling)

189
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,091
Whoa!

190
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,348
(laughing)

191
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:49,530
Did you get some candy?

192
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,220
- You got a piece Jackson

193
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,803
that's great.
- Wow!

194
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,284
- I was scared for my life.

195
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,510
- I was holding the kids
like both of them, like

196
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:04,070
- It was like slow motion,
I was just like yeah.

197
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,543
- It's been a long time,

198
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:07,232
no you can't go to Zupas.

199
00:08:07,232 --> 00:08:10,297
- You buy J Dawgs, I'll by Zupas.

200
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,710
- We haven't had J
Dawgs in like two years,

201
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,732
a yeah, I don't know, but
every time we come down here,

202
00:08:15,732 --> 00:08:17,488
you have to stop at J Dawgs,

203
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:19,696
because it's the best hot dog
this side of the Mississippi.

204
00:08:19,696 --> 00:08:20,529
What?

205
00:08:22,683 --> 00:08:24,000
- That family is laughing at us.

206
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,833
- [Jared] They were?

207
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,517
- I feel like I should've
told them to look us up,

208
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:29,410
and then I thought, no,
just let 'em laugh at us.

209
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:32,158
- [Jared] Wait, so you're telling me you

210
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,332
all chose Zupas over J Dawgs?

211
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,097
- [Jared] You guys should all be ashamed

212
00:08:36,097 --> 00:08:37,463
of yourself and your family.

213
00:08:37,464 --> 00:08:38,297
- [Ellie] She's okay.

214
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:39,130
- Jeepers.

215
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,645
Five hours in the car

216
00:08:41,645 --> 00:08:43,919
can give you one crick in the neck.

217
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,157
- I know seriously, but I am so glad

218
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:49,324
that Julie is not 13 or 15 hours away,

219
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,061
she's only two.

220
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:55,205
- Yeah, two and a half.
- So it was really fun.

221
00:08:55,205 --> 00:08:56,999
- I know, that little
extra stretch is hard,

222
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,941
but I'm really glad that
we decided to go hang out

223
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,087
and spend the evening
and the cousins playing.

224
00:09:02,087 --> 00:09:04,840
Sometimes when all the
family gets together,

225
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,144
it's always fun, but the
cousins like disperse

226
00:09:08,144 --> 00:09:09,434
and like they're gone.

227
00:09:09,434 --> 00:09:12,439
And it was kinda fun having
them more like one on one,

228
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:13,560
it was fun.

229
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,973
- Yeah, it was fun to
hang out and we love going

230
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:17,712
to Cornbelly's, we go I
think like every year.

231
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:19,220
- Yeah.
- Or we try to.

232
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,331
- Because it's a fun place in Utah

233
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:22,970
for Halloween and Thanksgiving

234
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,546
and the Tulip Festival and all of that.

235
00:09:24,546 --> 00:09:28,359
- We could've stayed four more hours.

236
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,664
- [Jared] We didn't even
scratch the surface.

237
00:09:29,664 --> 00:09:31,973
- Yeah, we just got like one section done.

238
00:09:31,973 --> 00:09:33,602
- But here's the thing,

239
00:09:33,602 --> 00:09:37,490
I think the past three
or four night total,

240
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,928
I think I've gotten seven hours of sleep.

241
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:43,153
Like for the past three nights total,

242
00:09:43,153 --> 00:09:45,734
so two plus three plus

243
00:09:45,734 --> 00:09:47,604
- [Ellie] Five.

244
00:09:47,604 --> 00:09:49,944
- Three and something like that, four,

245
00:09:49,944 --> 00:09:51,263
three two, I don't know.

246
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:53,136
I'm tired, so I'm gonna go to bed.

247
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,751
Ellie, sign off for us.

248
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:55,759
(laughs)

249
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,679
- Well first thanks Jared so much,

250
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,230
like this isn't a traditional job,

251
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,514
but Jared does put in more hours

252
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:03,777
than he ever has with
any other job he's had

253
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,385
and I'm grateful for him.

254
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,218
- [Jared] Well thank you.

255
00:10:06,218 --> 00:10:07,051
- And I'm grateful for you guys

256
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:08,696
and I'm grateful for Miss Penny,

257
00:10:08,696 --> 00:10:11,667
my pretty Penny, what the heck
are you doing on my pillow?

258
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:14,109
Extra special thank you to Christina

259
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,095
for watching the video today.

260
00:10:16,095 --> 00:10:17,630
Bye guys.

261
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,134
(snoring)

262
00:10:20,134 --> 00:00:00,000
- Bye.
