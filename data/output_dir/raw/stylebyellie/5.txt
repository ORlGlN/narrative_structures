2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,850
- I mean, I didn't mean to say that.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,115
I feel like the weather's
playing games with my heart.

4
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:09,948
- How did you do that?

5
00:00:11,056 --> 00:00:11,889
- Magic.

6
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:14,300
- All right, who's gonna
help me water some plants?

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,133
- Me.

8
00:00:15,133 --> 00:00:15,966
- Me.

9
00:00:15,966 --> 00:00:17,196
- [Ellie] Where's your water buckets?

10
00:00:17,196 --> 00:00:18,650
What!

11
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,460
'Kay, put them under here.

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,205
We just need a little bit,
that's probably great.

13
00:00:22,205 --> 00:00:25,620
Now Calvin's turn. (chuckles)

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,330
Oop! (chuckles)

15
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,220
Perfect.

16
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,640
So the kids planted some
flowers the other day,

17
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,890
and I planted something special.

18
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:35,800
We'll see if it works
out, but we are gonna

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,810
try and water these, and keep them alive.

20
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,700
It's snowing outside currently. (laughs)

21
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,498
'Kay, will you water
this one, and I'll let

22
00:00:42,498 --> 00:00:44,710
Calvin water those?

23
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,790
All across it, perfect.

24
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,710
What do you think of it?

25
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,967
- I want it to grow.

26
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,579
- (laughing) Me too.

27
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,416
We're gonna watch it every day, though,

28
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:55,720
and see when they start to sprout.

29
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,650
Do you wanna bring it over?

30
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,570
- Mm-hmm.
- [Jackson] What is this?

31
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,770
- [Ellie] 'Kay, bring it over.

32
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,600
Oh, part of the dirt.

33
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,433
The soil.

34
00:01:01,433 --> 00:01:03,483
(chuckling) Your face looks confused.

35
00:01:03,483 --> 00:01:05,519
It's just part of the soil.

36
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
- I wanna cover it.

37
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,283
- [Ellie] 'Kay, take your
finger and push it in then.

38
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,383
Perfect.

39
00:01:12,383 --> 00:01:15,660
And Calvin, we're gonna
move them all over, oop!

40
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,190
There you go, that way
not one just gets watered.

41
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,552
And your water's gone. (laughs)

42
00:01:20,552 --> 00:01:21,385
- I wanna do some--

43
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,512
- [Ellie] Do you have more water?

44
00:01:22,512 --> 00:01:25,400
'Kay, can you finish these two?

45
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,233
Good job.

46
00:01:27,283 --> 00:01:28,794

Let's brush your teeth, come on.

54
00:01:52,322 --> 00:01:55,072
(pleasant music)

55
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,220
It looks like spring
inside, but winter outside.

56
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,298
We're matching!

57
00:02:15,298 --> 00:02:16,131
- Mm-hmm.

58
00:02:16,131 --> 00:02:17,010
- I like your shirt!

59
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,990
- [Jared] I like your shirt.

60
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:21,240
- Um, I got, Julie and I
when we were out making

61
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,770
bath bombs last week,
me and her, we both got

62
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,050
matching kimonos from Anthropologie.

63
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,720
So hopefully one of these
days, Julie will wear it

64
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,942
the same day and we'll be matching.

65
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,663
- Ellie has been going to the
chiropractor for months now,

66
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:37,084
and I have been asking her
to take the camera with her

67
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:39,385
so she can film the cracking sounds.

68
00:02:39,385 --> 00:02:40,218
(Ellie laughs)

69
00:02:40,218 --> 00:02:41,750
It's hard to film when you're actually

70
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,313
getting the work done,
so I'm coming with Ellie

71
00:02:43,313 --> 00:02:44,420
(Ellie laughs)

72
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,970
and we are going to hear those cracks.

73
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,791
So, with that being said--

74
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:50,441
- What that, the sound of that is

75
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:52,550
your headache is now dismissed.

76
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,570
- [Jared] That's right.

77
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,165
- It's clockwork.

78
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:58,410
- Yeah. So with that being
said, if you're sensitive

79
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,920
to anything like that, just
skip ahead a couple seconds.

80
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,476
Otherwise, enjoy it with me.
- [Ellie] Unless she says

81
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:03,309
we can't film. (laughs)

82
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,883
- Yeah, we'll check first, obviously.

83
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:07,133
(cracking)

84
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:17,203
- It's crazy every time, Jared, my neck.

85
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:20,498
(cracking)

86
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,440
(Ellie chuckles)

87
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,989
Hey, girl, I had a good meeting.

88
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,773
- Bye, we'll see ya, girl.

89
00:03:28,773 --> 00:03:29,606
- [Ellie] Bye!

90
00:03:29,606 --> 00:03:30,650
- Bye!

91
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,580
Little snap, crackle, and pop there, huh?

92
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,667
How do you feel now?

93
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:36,405
- Um, you guys, I'm not even kidding you.

94
00:03:36,405 --> 00:03:38,484
Like, go to a chiropractor!

95
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,230
Growing up, we never went.

96
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,230
But it's very in my routine
now, in my life routine.

97
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,620
- Well, and that's the funny thing,

98
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,060
because the chiropractor
I had, I didn't like.

99
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,844
So your mileage may vary.

100
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:51,677
(chuckles)

101
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:53,102
But Ellie swears by it.
- Sorry, I didn't mean

102
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:53,935
to close that on you.

103
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:55,493
- That's okay, I can open my own door.

104
00:03:55,493 --> 00:03:56,560
Psh, come on!

105
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,320
- [Ellie] You always make me laugh!

106
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,863
Why are you closing your eyes?

107
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:01,151
- Where's your closet?

108
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:04,043
- (laughing) Where is it?

109
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,091
So the last few nights,
I have been working

110
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:09,825
on just organizing all the kid's closets,

111
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:11,547
getting the baby's closet ready.

112
00:04:11,547 --> 00:04:14,730
The boys have been sharing a
closet the last few months,

113
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,579
and I want to show you guys kind of how

114
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,779
I've been organizing it.

115
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:19,688
I just wrapped up a meeting
with Bonnie and Joel

116
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:22,390
and Jared about our Bollie line.

117
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,321
We are working on some new pieces,

118
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:27,649
some more sizing options
on our Bollie account.

119
00:04:27,649 --> 00:04:29,000
It's over now.

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,019
We just had a flash sale
on our Easter dress,

121
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:32,735
which I cannot wait to wear!

122
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,585
And it's just been a learning process,

123
00:04:34,585 --> 00:04:38,380
it's been a growing
process, it's been so fun.

124
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,425
And my mind is like, blown
every time we get together.

125
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:45,976
But we only have 60 dresses
left of the extra large,

126
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:48,832
so if you guys are still
needing a summer dress,

127
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:52,940
we only have 60 left of
those ones in that size.

128
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:56,450
So don't forget to check out
our website at BollieBrand.com.

129
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,930
We are gonna go show them our closet.

130
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,414
Should we start with the baby's?

131
00:05:00,414 --> 00:05:01,247
- Yeah.

132
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:02,080
- 'Kay.

133
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,670
So we've been working in the baby's room.

134
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,487
We have the rug down.

135
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:08,670
We're working on the shelving right now.

136
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,290
(chuckling) It's been a hot mess.

137
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,569
Jared and I went to do
the shelving yesterday.

138
00:05:13,569 --> 00:05:15,454
Ripped one of these out.

139
00:05:15,454 --> 00:05:17,638
It hasn't been very pretty,
but we're gonna get there.

140
00:05:17,638 --> 00:05:20,389
So I need to go into town
sometime and get a car seat,

141
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:21,941
and when I get a car seat I'm gonna get

142
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:24,847
some organizers for the closet.

143
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:27,680
But the baby, I've
never had child that has

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
so many clothes in their closet.

145
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,920
There are so many extra
clothes for the baby

146
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,510
because of Jackson and Calvin, like,

147
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,590
these are all of Calvin's
leftover clothes.

148
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,974
There's some new clothes for the baby.

149
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:40,820
He got some new jammies from Old Navy.

150
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,470
These are the softest
jammies in the world, guys.

151
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,120
But those are his clothes.

152
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,330
His shoes are down there.

153
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,490
- How does his feet doesn't come out?

154
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,690
- [Ellie] It keeps his feet warm.

155
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,966
- But I wanted one.

156
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,240
- [Ellie] (chuckling) You
used to wear stuff like that.

157
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,054
Should we find you a onesie jammie?

158
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:58,220
- (chuckling) Yeah.

159
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,630
- [Ellie] Maybe when we go to Target,

160
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,120
they'll have one for you.

161
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,307
But all of his swaddle
blankets are right here.

162
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:04,310
- [Jackson] When I'm a baby?

163
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,140
- [Ellie] They might
have a big size for you.

164
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,973
- Heh, why?

165
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:09,720
- (laughs) 'Cause you
want one, so we'll see.

166
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,365
We'll have to see if they have a big size.

167
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:12,198
- So funny.

168
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:13,263
- [Ellie] Would that be silly?

169
00:06:13,263 --> 00:06:14,096
- Yeah!

170
00:06:14,096 --> 00:06:17,158
- [Ellie] We have his swaddle
blankets, and his hats.

171
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:20,414
His burp rags, and his bibs.

172
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:25,325
And then I want to get a little
organizer for his medicines.

173
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:27,800
Even though we have a medicine cabinet,

174
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,426
I just feel like the first
year of a baby's life,

175
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:32,411
like, especially around six months,

176
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:34,150
like when they're teething tons,

177
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,590
you need gas relief drops, and you need,

178
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,010
like, teething gel and stuff.

179
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,250
I just kind of like having
it in the baby's room.

180
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,562
So I would like to get a little cubby

181
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:43,418
or a little organizer for that.

182
00:06:43,418 --> 00:06:45,690
And then I'll just put, like,
look at his little shorts.

183
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,742
His little shorts right here.

184
00:06:47,742 --> 00:06:49,880
And then he just has some binkies there.

185
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,884
So, I mean, it's not way organized,

186
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:54,600
but it's kind of organized enough.

187
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,276
So my goal today is to
get a few organizers

188
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:59,209
for the baby's closet,
and to get a car seat.

189
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:01,500
- Do you wanna see some magic?

190
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,385
- [Jared] Yes, I do.

191
00:07:02,385 --> 00:07:04,014
(coin clanking)
(Jared gasps)

192
00:07:04,014 --> 00:07:05,120
- [Ellie] Whoa!

193
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,580
- [Jared] Nice job!

194
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,413
Good job, bud!

195
00:07:07,413 --> 00:07:09,193
- Dad, I want you to try.

196
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:11,386
(coin clanking)

197
00:07:11,386 --> 00:07:13,136
How did you do that?!

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,943
- Magic!

199
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,776
(laughs)

200
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,250
- He is so good!

201
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,730
So the boys closets have
actually been really nice.

202
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:23,966
They've been sharing a closet, and Jackson

203
00:07:23,966 --> 00:07:28,400
has this whole side plus
a shelf for his pants.

204
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,203
And this is perfect because Jackson comes

205
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,680
and gets ready by himself every day.

206
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,501
He likes to get dressed by himself.

207
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:37,281
Very little does he want me to help him.

208
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:39,481
- And someday I'll want
you to get me dressed.

209
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,809
- Some days, but not most days, huh?

210
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:44,020
Yeah, most days he's like, "I can do it!"

211
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:47,310
So he comes in, he grabs, he puts his jam,

212
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,705
I tell him to put his jammies away.

213
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,308
Half the time I do that.

214
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:53,870
But he puts his socks on,
he puts his underwear on,

215
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,407
and then he has the shirts to choose from,

216
00:07:55,407 --> 00:07:57,380
and he can reach his pants.

217
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,760
His shorts are right there.

218
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,540
A lot of these are from last
year that will still fit him,

219
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,370
and then he has these cute
shark pair from Walmart,

220
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:09,263
and then these cute ones
from Old Navy that are new.

221
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:12,310
And then Calvin's is the same thing.

222
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,170
He has this little drawer,
his shorts are on the side,

223
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,690
he has jammies, he's got socks,
and he has his underwear,

224
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,360
not very many. (chuckles)

225
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
'Cause they're all in the washer!

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,640
And then he has his pants up here,

227
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,862
and then all of his clothes.

228
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:29,435
I've really liked this
setup with both of the boys,

229
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:32,320
and I don't know, maybe
they have a lot of clothes.

230
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,596
I don't want to say this
and be like, they have tons!

231
00:08:34,596 --> 00:08:38,077
I feel like they don't have,
like, tons, tons of clothes.

232
00:08:38,077 --> 00:08:40,883
I just like to have, like,
Jackson's winter clothes,

233
00:08:40,883 --> 00:08:44,586
these are most, you see
them on them all the time.

234
00:08:44,586 --> 00:08:47,126
They have like a handful of sweaters,

235
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,827
and then he outgrows
them, they go to Calvin

236
00:08:49,827 --> 00:08:51,059
for next winter.

237
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:53,555
Or he has a few that
he wears all the time,

238
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:55,643
and ends up wearing them out like crazy,

239
00:08:55,643 --> 00:08:57,015
and then we donate them.

240
00:08:57,015 --> 00:08:59,230
So maybe they do, I don't know!

241
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,730
I feel like this is a good amount,

242
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,459
like if they had any more clothes,

243
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,290
I would be overwhelmed.

244
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,030
But this is their closet.

245
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,240
How do you like it?

246
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,870
You get dressed by yourself
everyday, huh, mister?

247
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,490
He's trying to, (gasps)
that was a good one!

248
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,811
- (chuckles) Thank you.

249
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:15,811
It is magic.

250
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:19,640
- [Ellie] Whoa! (chuckles)

251
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,280
You need to hang out with
the Ballinger family.

252
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,755
They do lots of magic.

253
00:09:23,755 --> 00:09:24,650
- [Jackson] Yep.

254
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:27,134
- [Ellie] I love having
this shelf kind of empty,

255
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:29,632
well, it's obviously full,
but empty just to put

256
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:31,830
whatever we want, like
their knick-knacks on.

257
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,180
Jackson's rocks.

258
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,610
And these pictures were
painted of the kids,

259
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,306
I so badly want to get them framed,

260
00:09:37,306 --> 00:09:39,680
and have them right here, and then just

261
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,330
like their knick-knacks right there.

262
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,917
My goal not only is to get a car seat,

263
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:47,917
but eventually get a actual
bookshelf for the boys,

264
00:09:47,997 --> 00:09:50,946
'cause, as you can see, their
books have gone in here,

265
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:54,100
but it's really small,
it's not like a bookshelf.

266
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,573
So that's something that
is on my list of ideas

267
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:58,983
when I go into town.

268
00:10:04,683 --> 00:10:06,530
- (sighs) I feel like the weather's

269
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,613
playing games with my heart.

270
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:10,700
One day, the weather's
amazing, it's spring outside,

271
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,920
we're outside riding
bikes and playing games

272
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,990
and having fun and running
and picking up poop

273
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,651
with the shovels, and everything is great.

274
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,730
And then the next day, it's snowing.

275
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,689
This morning we actually had
about two or three inches,

276
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:24,710
and then it all melted away.

277
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,302
And now it's snowing again.

278
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,860
This is literally the weather in Utah.

279
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,223
There was two inches of snow.

280
00:10:30,223 --> 00:10:32,560
Then around lunchtime, it melted.

281
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,901
And now it is, oh I don't
know, let's see, 4:00.

282
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,661
And it is now snowing again.

283
00:10:37,661 --> 00:10:39,570
So if you're not happy with the weather,

284
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,730
just wait five minutes.

285
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,850
And that's like a life principle.

286
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,050
Just embrace things.

287
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,380
Just take things as they come.

288
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,984
And Jared, I'm talking to
you when I'm saying that.

289
00:10:46,984 --> 00:10:50,360
Yes, I'm talking to myself. (laughs)

290
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,107
I just, I need to stop having expectations

291
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:56,653
and just embrace it, 'kay,
enjoy the weather as it is.

292
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,136
Okay, I can do it.

293
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,055
- [Ellie] If you catch this one, we eat

294
00:11:04,055 --> 00:11:06,720
chocolate chip cookies.

295
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,141
If you don't catch it, we eat broccoli.

296
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:11,258
- Okay.

297
00:11:11,258 --> 00:11:12,944
- [Ellie] Better catch it.

298
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:13,777
- 'Kay!

299
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,402
- [Ellie] Agh!

300
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,727
- [Jackson] Broccoli time!

301
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:19,560
(laughs)

302
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,393
- 'Kay.

303
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,034
- [Ellie] What!

304
00:11:22,034 --> 00:11:26,088
- I get a cookie, I get
a cookie, I get a cookie!

305
00:11:26,088 --> 00:11:28,150
- [Jared] (laughs) Hi, guys!

306
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,299
- You have a cookie.

307
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:31,190
- I have a cookie!

308
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,250
- So, it's snowing.

309
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,083
- [Jared] Mm-hmm.

310
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,351
- And I'm not going to drive the canyon.

311
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:37,740
So we'll get a car seat another day.

312
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,573
- [Jared] It sounds like we're gonna have

313
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:39,989
broccoli tonight, Jackson.

314
00:11:39,989 --> 00:11:40,822
- No.

315
00:11:40,822 --> 00:11:41,963
- [Jared] Yeah buddy!

316
00:11:44,118 --> 00:11:45,468
- [Ellie] Agh!
- Oh!

317
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:47,094
That's my boy!

318
00:11:47,094 --> 00:11:48,543
- I get a cookie.

319
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:49,756
(Ellie and Jared laugh)

320
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:51,010
Do this.

321
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,843
- [Jared] Now he's happy.

322
00:11:51,843 --> 00:11:52,920
- Now catch it.

323
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,753
- [Jackson] 'Kay.

324
00:11:53,753 --> 00:11:56,036
- Don't not catch it.

325
00:11:56,036 --> 00:11:58,015
'Cause I don't want to
eat broccoli for dinner.

326
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,223
(Jared chuckles)

327
00:11:59,223 --> 00:12:00,056
Catch it.

328
00:12:00,056 --> 00:12:02,256
- [Jackson] 'Kay.

329
00:12:02,256 --> 00:12:03,570
- [Ellie] Agh!
- [Jared] Aw!

330
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:05,630
That was a bad throw, Mom.

331
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,250
Jackson, that was not your fault.

332
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,230
Mom gave you a bad throw.

333
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,130
Redo, I'm calling a redo.

334
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:13,030
I'm the referee, and I'm calling a redo.

335
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,360
- Calvin, every time we film
he's out of the room today.

336
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,394
- [Jared] Yeah, he just ran away.

337
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:17,430
- You guys just won't see him today.

338
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,437
Here, catch.

339
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,600
- [Jackson] 'Kay.

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,500
- Eye on the ball.

341
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:22,618
(Jared chuckles)

342
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:23,967
You didn't even try to catch it!

343
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:27,295
- [Jared] You made me flinch.
- Get your eye on the ball.

344
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,857
Woo!
- [Jared] Hey!

345
00:12:28,857 --> 00:12:30,313
- I get a cookie!

346
00:12:30,313 --> 00:12:31,990
(Ellie and Jared laugh)

347
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,849
- [Jared] What are you looking for?

348
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:34,490
- My red plate.

349
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,040
- [Jared] Your red plate?

350
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,880
It might be dirty.

351
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,946
What do you need it for?

352
00:12:37,946 --> 00:12:39,630
- I want my red plate.

353
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,949
- [Jared] What are you
gonna put on your red plate?

354
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:42,282
- [Calvin] Um...

355
00:12:43,668 --> 00:12:45,520
One tiny cookie.

356
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,353
- [Jared] A cookie?

357
00:12:46,353 --> 00:12:49,232
(Calvin vocalizing)

358
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,873
So Calvin thinks that he
doesn't need to catch a football

359
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:54,770
or anything to get a cookie, let's see.

360
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,250
This is all dirty, bud.

361
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,346
Let's close it up, 'kay?

362
00:12:57,346 --> 00:12:58,556
- [Calvin] My red plate.

363
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,230
Get my red plate.

364
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,960
- [Jared] You want your red plate?

365
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,810
Should we get it?

366
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:04,627
Should we wash it?

367
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:07,086
Actually maybe, no it's
dirty, let's wash it, 'kay?

368
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,110
- Okay.

369
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:08,965
- [Jared] Here's the plate.

370
00:13:08,965 --> 00:13:10,943
Put a little bit of soap on it.

371
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,110
Good, perfect, great.

372
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:15,550
And we use the washcloth.

373
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:18,190
Get the washcloth wet.

374
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,087
♪ And we'll make some suds ♪

375
00:13:22,087 --> 00:13:26,007
♪ We will make some suds, yeah ♪

376
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:29,834

377
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:33,483
♪ Singing my cleaning song ♪

378
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:37,237
♪ I hope you sing along ♪

379
00:13:37,237 --> 00:13:40,570
♪ Singing my cleaning song ♪

380
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,130
Okay, I just washed it.

381
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,130
Now you dry it.

382
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:43,963
- [Calvin] Okay.

383
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:44,955
- [Jared] You drying it?

384
00:13:44,955 --> 00:13:46,630
- Yes.
- [Jared] Good.

385
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,463
Is it dry?

386
00:13:47,463 --> 00:13:48,560
- Yes, it's dry.

387
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,880
- [Jared] Okay, what do you
want to put on the plate?

388
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,120
- Um, the tiny cookie on the plate.

389
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,124
- [Jared] A tiny cookie on the plate?

390
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:54,957
- Yeah.

391
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:55,790
- [Jared] Okay.

392
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,833
- But you didn't catch a ball.

393
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:57,666
- [Jared] I told him that.

394
00:13:57,666 --> 00:13:58,499
He said, "I don't care."

395
00:13:58,499 --> 00:13:59,952
- Of course he did.

396
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,818
He probably flipped you off,
too, that's Calvin's attitude.

397
00:14:02,818 --> 00:14:04,450
(both laugh)

398
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,270
- [Jared] Um, Calvin, I
don't see any tiny cookies.

399
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,676
I just see big cookies.

400
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,449
- No, tiny, tiny cookies.

401
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:12,282
- [Jackson] We can break it apart!

402
00:14:12,282 --> 00:14:13,503
- [Jared] That's a great idea.

403
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,904
- [Calvin] No thanks!

404
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:16,260
- [Jared] No, no, a big one?

405
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,760
- No, tiny please.

406
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,350
- We'll find the tiniest one.

407
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,341
- [Jared] Okay.

408
00:14:21,341 --> 00:14:22,758
Mmm-mmm-mmm, oop!

409
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,062
That's the tiniest one.

410
00:14:26,062 --> 00:14:27,395
- Not this kind.

411
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,582
I want these.

412
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:34,440
- Is he just going for
the chocolate chips?

413
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,273
Is it good?

414
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:36,106
- Mm-hmm.

415
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:36,939
- [Jared] Good.

416
00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:38,250
Do you want some milk?

417
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,260
Okay. (softly chuckles)

418
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,011
You can't have a cookie without milk.

419
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:43,761
(pleasant music)

420
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,364
And just like that, not one hour later,

421
00:15:17,364 --> 00:15:21,120
all of that snow is gone and melted.

422
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
Ellie, I think you are exactly right.

423
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,646
The weather is all over the
place, just like your hormones.

424
00:15:26,646 --> 00:15:28,559
I mean, I didn't mean to say that.

425
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:29,774
- (chuckles)

426
00:15:29,774 --> 00:15:31,305
Why would you say that?!

427
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,138
No, it--

428
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,630
- Your hormones are just right, Ellie.

429
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,520
- It is true, though.

430
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,425
I think I've had a harder time mentally.

431
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:37,410
- [Jared] Yeah.

432
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,243
- This time around.

433
00:15:38,243 --> 00:15:40,045
- [Jackson] I want to
give these to someone.

434
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,947
- You (chuckling), oh my.
- [Jared] Aww.

435
00:15:41,947 --> 00:15:43,619
- Who are you gonna give them to?

436
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:44,621
- Cody and Bennett.

437
00:15:44,621 --> 00:15:46,160
- [Ellie And Jared] Aww.
- Are those your friends?

438
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,902
Your neighbor friends?

439
00:15:47,902 --> 00:15:48,930
- [Jared] How sweet is that?

440
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,433
- [Jackson] I'm gonna give them to them.

441
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,480
- Jackson, that's like the nicest thing.

442
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,606
Holy crap.

443
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:56,040
- [Jackson] I wanna do that.

444
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,537
- 'Kay, you hold them and we'll give them

445
00:15:57,537 --> 00:15:58,590
to your friends, okay?

446
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,461
- 'Kay, I will just knock on the door

447
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,367
and see if they like them.

448
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,964
- Aww, okay.

449
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,211
- This one's for Bennett,
and this one's for Cody.

450
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:09,796
- 'Kay, go get your shoes on.

451
00:16:09,796 --> 00:16:11,157
- Are we doing this right now?

452
00:16:11,157 --> 00:16:12,483
- I guess we're doing it.
- I guess we're doing this.

453
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:13,920
- I'm not gonna say no.

454
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,753
- Yeah, seriously.

455
00:16:14,753 --> 00:16:16,767
- We made cookies, and he
said, "Can I give these

456
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,020
"to my friends?"

457
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,030
And usually, I'm always
like, "Yeah, yeah."

458
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,740
But it was downpour snowing.

459
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,890
- Snowing, yeah it was snowing like crazy.

460
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,358
- And I said, "No we're just, not gonna."

461
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:26,920
That was really cute.

462
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,780
- That was cute.

463
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,780
'Kay, hey, I guess we're
going to the neighbor's house.

464
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,080
Let's go.
- [Ellie] 'Kay.

465
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,340
- He just told Calvin to go under,

466
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,740
and then as soon as Calvin got under,

467
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,079
he opened it to come out.

468
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:42,912
- 'Kay, look at Mom.

469
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:45,563
I'm gonna watch you.

470
00:16:45,563 --> 00:16:48,320
I don't want you to go inside and play.

471
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,620
You just knock on the door and say,

472
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,670
"Hi, I wanna give this to Bennett."

473
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,114
And then you leave, you don't
go in the house to play.

474
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:55,947
- [Jackson] 'Kay.

475
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,030
- [Ellie] 'Kay, and I'm gonna watch you

476
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,283
and make sure you listen, okay?

477
00:16:58,283 --> 00:16:59,116
- Okay.

478
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:00,400
So Calvin's not coming.

479
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,550
- [Ellie] Well, Calvin looks
like he wants to come with you.

480
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,447
Can you walk with him?

481
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:05,848
- Yeah, I'm gonna go to
Bennett's house first.

482
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:07,939
- [Ellie] Okay, I'll watch ya.

483
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,319
- [Jackson] Let's go.

484
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,019
- (laughs)

485
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,619
He found toys to go give to his friend.

486
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,628
- [Jared] That's so sweet.

487
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,711
- I wanna show you guys one last thing.

488
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,530
I kind of wanted today's
video to be a little bit

489
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,119
more about like organization.

490
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,009
Not that I did organization,
just kinda showed you

491
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:28,470
what we're kind of doing and planning.

492
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,479
We recently, Jared had
hung this up that he got

493
00:17:31,479 --> 00:17:34,244
from Lowe's that has our mop and vacuum on

494
00:17:34,244 --> 00:17:37,113
that I really love, 'cause
it used to be on the floor.

495
00:17:37,113 --> 00:17:40,366
But my whole pantry looks so different

496
00:17:40,366 --> 00:17:43,669
than what it was, and Jackson walked in,

497
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:45,180
Bonnie walked in, and they're like,

498
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,830
"What?! It's so different!"

499
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,680
So I finally got around to organizing!

500
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,859
And I am so happy with it.

501
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:56,700
Our pantry is really big, and
so it's not all just food.

502
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,980
So up here, I have my bread bowl,

503
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,430
and I have my Ziploc bags up here.

504
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,408
These all came from Big
Lots, and this is like

505
00:18:03,408 --> 00:18:06,480
the kid's craft stuff
that I don't really want

506
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,831
them getting into, and so
it's more like I have them

507
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:12,460
in here, and then I get them
out for them to play with.

508
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,663
'Cause the puzzles would
be, they would never play

509
00:18:14,663 --> 00:18:18,140
with the puzzles if all of the
puzzles were mixed together,

510
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,985
so puzzles are in a box, crayons, markers,

511
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:25,420
those are more puzzles,
Play-Doh, paper, scissors,

512
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,186
and Jackson's preschool
craft books are all in there.

513
00:18:28,186 --> 00:18:31,610
I find a lot of his
preschool stuff on Amazon,

514
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,730
like I just search preschool books,

515
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,610
and a ton of cool stuff comes up.

516
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,670
So that's where that is, this
shelf is usually fairly empty.

517
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,117
And then this is just like my mop

518
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:44,970
and my cleaning bucket with my stuff.

519
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,369
So that is that side.

520
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:47,971
These are amazing.

521
00:18:47,971 --> 00:18:52,472
Again, we got these at Big
Lots, these have drinks in them.

522
00:18:52,472 --> 00:18:57,410
This is our fruit, this is
like pasta and cooking stuff.

523
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,307
This is like all of our rice,
and granola, chocolate chips.

524
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:04,292
And these are just like extra
cans that I have on hand.

525
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:07,594
It's always nice to
have some cans of food.

526
00:19:07,594 --> 00:19:10,850
Marshmallow stuff, our treats are up here,

527
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,693
we've got bread, straws,
breakfast, snack stuff,

528
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:16,983
crackers, and then of course like cereal,

529
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:20,012
and like graham crackers
and Goldfish are in those,

530
00:19:20,012 --> 00:19:21,590
and then our oatmeal.

531
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:24,483
And then down here, I love
having a stool in here,

532
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:27,443
and these are Gathre
mats that I really liked

533
00:19:27,443 --> 00:19:30,480
having my flour and sugar in here.

534
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,313
What are you doing? (laughs)

535
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,190
- What is it even made out of?

536
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,908
This is like the most amazing thing.

537
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:36,497
- [Ellie] I thought it
was Calvin crawling in.

538
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:38,208
Jared's playing with the kinetic sand.

539
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:40,460
And then I have another little thing of

540
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,846
like flour and sugar
that I eventually want

541
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:43,600
to get in there.

542
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,215
This has been, like, a
fun thing for me to do

543
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:48,979
is just kind of like,
(sighs) just do this.

544
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,389
Yeah, it feels good to
have this looking better

545
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:53,810
and having it more organized.

546
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,100
So that is like some of
the spring cleaning stuff

547
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,120
that I have been doing.

548
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,530
I would love to know what your guys'

549
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,440
spring cleaning goals are.

550
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,013
I think that's about it for the house.

551
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,381
You mad, Jackson?

552
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:07,642
Or are you happy?

553
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,990
'Kay, he's happy.

554
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,588
Good grief, I thought you were gonna.

555
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:11,930
- [Jared] I'm inching my way back.

556
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,518
- [Jackson] I dig this with my head.

557
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:16,030
(Jared laughs)
- [Ellie] Oh wow!

558
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,250
That is it for my spring cleaning.

559
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,815
The last and final
thing we really wanna do

560
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:24,730
is just finish up the baby's
room and put some shelves up.

561
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,800
Should we do that today?

562
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,600
- Oh, um, we could try.

563
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,749
- We tried last night, and
we got a little frustrated.

564
00:20:30,749 --> 00:20:31,890
(laughs)

565
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,389
Kids, we want you to go
downstairs so Daddy and I

566
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:34,620
can play with the sand.

567
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,310
- [Jared] Yeah, we wanna
play with the sand.

568
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,624
- [Ellie] So why don't you guys go play.

569
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:39,248
- [Jared] Look, there's my face.

570
00:20:39,248 --> 00:20:40,760
(chuckling) Do you see my face?

571
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,640
That's my nose.

572
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,113
So we're gonna go play with kinetic sand,

573
00:20:43,113 --> 00:20:45,560
and that is our day today.

574
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,010
Thank you guys so much for watching.

575
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,824
If you enjoyed it, be sure
to give it a big thumbs up,

576
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:52,224
and we will see you guys next time.

577
00:20:52,224 --> 00:00:00,000
Bye.
