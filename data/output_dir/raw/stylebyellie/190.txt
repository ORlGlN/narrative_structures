1
00:00:00,346 --> 00:00:02,569
- There you go. All ready.

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:03,710
- [Jared] What in the world?

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,365
Is this like some
Mission Impossible stuff?

4
00:00:06,365 --> 00:00:07,198
- Cheers.

5
00:00:09,992 --> 00:00:12,884
- I don't know if I get
mad or if I just hug him

6
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:13,978
and be grateful.

7
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:16,561
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:21,362 --> 00:00:22,862
Come here, mister.

9
00:00:24,433 --> 00:00:25,927
K, let's do your hair.

10
00:00:25,927 --> 00:00:27,177
Look in the mirror.

11
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,507
All ready for preschool.

12
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:32,144
- I don't need this hair band.

13
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:34,311
- There you go. All ready.

14
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:36,325
- I don't need it.

15
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:37,380
- You don't need it?

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,213
- No.

17
00:00:38,213 --> 00:00:39,046
- I like it.

18
00:00:39,046 --> 00:00:40,141
It keeps the hair out of your eyes.

19
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:42,281
Should we just do it
like we usually do it?

20
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:43,145
- Yes.

21
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:44,361
(laughs)

22
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,511
- I'm just kidding, Jackson.

23
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:48,427
We're not putting a ponytail in your hair.

24
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:51,720
We'll do hair gel like we always do.

25
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,826
Jackson asked me what
a ponytail was today,

26
00:00:53,826 --> 00:00:55,105
so that's why I did that.

27
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,855
(pleasant music)

28
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,218
Ready? All done?

29
00:01:02,218 --> 00:01:03,051
- Yes!

30
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:05,844
- Today, I dropped Jackson off at school,

31
00:01:05,844 --> 00:01:07,742
and he totally did not look back.

32
00:01:07,742 --> 00:01:09,372
He was so excited to go,

33
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:13,709
and we are taking Miss
Penny on a walk and Calvin.

34
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,273
I was gonna call you Jackson.

35
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:17,514
Can I hold your hand?

36
00:01:17,514 --> 00:01:18,963
Can I hold your hand?

37
00:01:18,963 --> 00:01:20,268
This is his way of saying no.

38
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:24,435
He put his hands in his
pocket, you little stinker.

39
00:01:25,326 --> 00:01:26,743
Look at the bees.

40
00:01:27,727 --> 00:01:29,203
Isn't that cool?

41
00:01:29,203 --> 00:01:31,543
(baby talking)

42
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:32,390
You don't wanna touch.

43
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,485
We'll just look.

44
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:34,853
It's so pretty.

45
00:01:34,853 --> 00:01:36,797
(baby talking)

46
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,880
Can you hold my hand now?

47
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:42,870
Let me see your swole.

48
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,703
- What?

49
00:01:43,703 --> 00:01:44,536
- [Ellie] Let me see it.

50
00:01:44,536 --> 00:01:45,957
- [Jared] Oh, geez.

51
00:01:45,957 --> 00:01:46,790
- [Ellie] I just had a baby.

52
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,726
(laughs)

53
00:01:48,726 --> 00:01:50,870
- That was easy.
- It was easy.

54
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,703
Just came right on out.

55
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:54,549
- And for only 19.95,
you can make it easy too.

56
00:01:54,549 --> 00:01:55,382
- [Ellie] K, let me see your arms.

57
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,571
- Oh my gosh, k.

58
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:59,521
- [Ellie] Look, you did so good today.

59
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,592
- Okay, here's the thing.

60
00:02:00,592 --> 00:02:01,868
I just finished my workout before we--

61
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,015
- [Ellie] You just had a baby too!

62
00:02:03,015 --> 00:02:04,191
- Oh, that was easy!

63
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,667
If you're a male and wanna have a baby

64
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,673
for only one, low, easy payment of 19.95,

65
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:08,777
we can make it happen for you.

66
00:02:08,777 --> 00:02:09,610
Just kidding.

67
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,055
That's biological.

68
00:02:11,056 --> 00:02:12,828
I can't get into that for legal reasons.

69
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:13,661
- [Ellie] Oh my.

70
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:16,932
- Anyway, so I did my workout,
and ever since I was a kid

71
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:18,184
like in high school doing bench press

72
00:02:18,184 --> 00:02:20,585
or pushups and everything, the left side

73
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:24,733
of my pecs activate
more than my right side,

74
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,313
and it bothers me that, when
I do a pushup, I feel it,

75
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:29,790
right up in here.

76
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,095
I can feel this one is building--

77
00:02:31,095 --> 00:02:32,588
- [Ellie] But that's your
left side, which is weird.

78
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:35,314
- Yeah, and I'm right-handed,
and this side doesn't,

79
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:37,611
and I've never stopped to ask why.

80
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:40,030
I've just worked out, and--

81
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,863
- [Ellie] It's weird.

82
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:43,591
- It bothers me now,
'cause I can feel like,

83
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:47,758
if I flex my pec, I can feel
it more on the left side.

84
00:02:48,906 --> 00:02:52,534
- I don't really know if
I feel that difference.

85
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:55,852
- Let me check yours just in case.

86
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,045
- Woohoo, we're done with preschool.

87
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:02,182
Jackson enjoyed his other day,
his second day at preschool.

88
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,885
You were so cute when I picked you up,

89
00:03:03,885 --> 00:03:05,481
just playing with your friends.

90
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:06,369
I have to run into town.

91
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,477
We're doing family pictures.

92
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:09,024
I just wanna see if I can find something.

93
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,296
- We does color in watering cans.

94
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:14,177
- And what did you wanna do
while we were at the mall?

95
00:03:14,177 --> 00:03:15,725
- To slide on the floor.

96
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:19,234
- His request was to go
eat at Pretzel Maker.

97
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:20,717
Should we go get a pretzel?

98
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:21,865
- Yes.

99
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,237
Cheers!

100
00:03:23,237 --> 00:03:24,704
- This is the face you
get when you find out

101
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:28,547
there's no toys in the
stores we're going into.

102
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:32,064
Sorry, we're just looking at
clothes for family pictures.

103
00:03:32,064 --> 00:03:33,622
Lame, lame, lame.

104
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:34,872
It's never fun,

105
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,299
but at least you'll
look good for pictures.

106
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:40,882
Don't be a stinker.

107
00:03:41,784 --> 00:03:44,899
Dance, dance, dance,
dance, dance, dance, dance.

108
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,240
This is the best date.

109
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,105
Why is this the best date?

110
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,616
- Because it is.

111
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:52,673
- Because you got gum out
of the gumball machine.

112
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:55,140
Are you gonna help me find a dress?

113
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,316
K, you dance really cute,
'cause that makes me happy.

114
00:03:58,316 --> 00:03:59,821
So cute.

115
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:01,816
All right-y, I'm gonna
try and be a little quiet,

116
00:04:01,816 --> 00:04:05,560
'cause Calvin is asleep on my
bed, but I wanna show you guys

117
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,385
what I have for family pictures.

118
00:04:07,385 --> 00:04:09,817
We're doing pictures to
update everything again.

119
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:13,426
We did pictures one year
ago, and it's crazy how fast

120
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:15,088
it's like our kids are changed.

121
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,851
We're doing family pictures again.

122
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:18,742
It's been kinda hard to
put outfits together,

123
00:04:18,743 --> 00:04:20,478
'cause I've wanted a little bit more color

124
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,154
in this year's pictures.

125
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,685
If it's totally out of
whack, you could tell me,

126
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:28,553
and I won't be offended,
but the boys are gonna have

127
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:32,518
matching shoes, and they
have mustard yellow pants.

128
00:04:32,518 --> 00:04:34,407
Jackson's wearing navy blue.

129
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,675
This is what I think Calvin's gonna wear,

130
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:39,501
and then this is what I
found today at The Balm.

131
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,365
I went into the store, and I
told the lady at the store,

132
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,143
I said, "Thank you so much
for being so nice to me,"

133
00:04:45,143 --> 00:04:48,186
because sometimes I leave
specifically that store,

134
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:51,765
and I feel a little intimidated
or just a little bombarded

135
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:55,274
sometimes, and she was so
helpful, and she just walked me

136
00:04:55,274 --> 00:04:57,084
around the store,
grabbed a bunch of stuff.

137
00:04:57,084 --> 00:04:58,695
She's like, "This'll look
good with mustard yellow.

138
00:04:58,695 --> 00:05:00,504
"This'll look good," and she was so cute.

139
00:05:00,504 --> 00:05:03,156
So, so glad that I found this,

140
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:05,623
and I would totally never
have picked this up,

141
00:05:05,623 --> 00:05:08,069
because I usually don't
wear dresses like this,

142
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,193
because sometimes I feel
a little funny in them,

143
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:13,274
because it's so loose and long,

144
00:05:13,274 --> 00:05:16,180
and I don't know if it's
very flattering on me,

145
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,096
but I tried it on, and I liked it,

146
00:05:19,096 --> 00:05:21,391
so hopefully I'll continue
to like it next week

147
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:22,345
when we do pictures.

148
00:05:22,345 --> 00:05:24,522
Now, I just need to find
something for Jared,

149
00:05:24,522 --> 00:05:28,353
and he just got some new
shirts, so we'll have to look

150
00:05:28,353 --> 00:05:30,137
to see what he has for this.

151
00:05:30,137 --> 00:05:30,970
So fun!

152
00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:36,363
What is so crazy to me is
Jackson is in a shoe size eight,

153
00:05:37,298 --> 00:05:40,321
and Calvin is in a shoe size seven,

154
00:05:40,321 --> 00:05:43,804
and I think it's crazy
that they pretty much

155
00:05:43,804 --> 00:05:46,107
are like right there on the same size.

156
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:49,140
It's weird to put Calvin
in a big pair of shoes.

157
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,795
That's Calvin's feet.

158
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:51,628
That's so crazy.

159
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:55,186
I got these at Old Navy, and
these are some new fall clothes

160
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,240
for them as well.

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,596
They'll wear these to church, so so fun.

162
00:05:59,596 --> 00:06:01,261
Can't wait to get family pictures done.

163
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:02,664
- What in the world?

164
00:06:02,664 --> 00:06:05,249
Is this like some Mission
Impossible stuff that you guys

165
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:07,559
have going on here?

166
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,974
Don't you know you could open that gate?

167
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:11,116
What are you boys doing?

168
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:13,080
Are you guys going on an adventure?

169
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,690
(laughs)

170
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,289
- [Jackson] I don't wanna go.

171
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,534
- Are you opening it for me,

172
00:06:17,534 --> 00:06:19,597
because you know my belly's too big?

173
00:06:19,597 --> 00:06:22,782
I know! I'm working on it, okay?

174
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,282
I'm working on it.

175
00:06:26,604 --> 00:06:28,765
A friend of ours is working
with a local high school here,

176
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:31,724
and they're raising money
for their football team,

177
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:34,751
and he asked me if we had
anything that we could donate

178
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,387
for the football team for a
silent auction and everything.

179
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:39,510
I was like, I think I can
come up with some cool things

180
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,507
for that, so I wanna show you.

181
00:06:41,507 --> 00:06:45,338
We've got the custom Ellie
and Jared shirt here,

182
00:06:45,338 --> 00:06:48,022
the camera logo, the Ellie
and Jared circle logo

183
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:50,498
that everyone knows and
loves, and I threw in a couple

184
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:55,340
GoPros for this silent
auction, fundraiser thing.

185
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,357
I'm excited to do that.

186
00:06:56,357 --> 00:07:00,227
It feels cool to be part of
the community and everything,

187
00:07:00,227 --> 00:07:02,233
and they have all of these events,

188
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:05,283
like the thing that my
dad played jazz band for.

189
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,858
I want to be a part of those things,

190
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:10,205
and I want to help with the
community around the area,

191
00:07:10,205 --> 00:07:13,486
and this is like a fun way
to get started with that.

192
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:15,626
I've got these shirts that we can give,

193
00:07:15,626 --> 00:07:19,049
and the GoPros, I think, is
a fun addition to give too.

194
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:21,655
We leave for Los Angeles
early tomorrow morning,

195
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:25,328
and we have so much to do to
get ready for that tonight,

196
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:27,405
but I figured we'd let
the boys play a little bit

197
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,863
and then get down to business.

198
00:07:28,863 --> 00:07:30,644
Let's cue the play montage.

199
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:33,061
(funk music)

200
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,975
- Baby, I'm home.

201
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,719
- [Jared] Oh my gosh, Ellie.

202
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,491
- It must be a big difference,
'cause Jared literally

203
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:35,182
hung up the phone when I walked in.

204
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,576
- [Jared] Yeah, I hung up the phone.

205
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,619
I was talking with Joel.
- You could tell a difference?

206
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,702
- Oh my gosh.

207
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:41,705
- [Ellie] Yeah, you like it?

208
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,783
- Yes, El, it looks great, Ellie.

209
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:44,890
- Aw, thanks.

210
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,762
- [Jared] The blond is not, like--

211
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:47,735
- It's cooler.

212
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:48,568
- [Jared] Yeah, it's cooler.

213
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,492
I was gonna say it's not platinum blond,

214
00:08:50,492 --> 00:08:52,008
but it's like a dirty blond.

215
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:52,841
- Thank you.

216
00:08:52,841 --> 00:08:56,417
Do you guys remember
forever ago when I went

217
00:08:56,417 --> 00:08:58,731
to the wrong person to get my hair done?

218
00:08:58,731 --> 00:08:59,648
I missed the address.

219
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:01,815
Anyway, Jared had called her and was like,

220
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:02,995
"Please get my wife in".

221
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:03,828
We never heard anything.

222
00:09:03,828 --> 00:09:05,972
I have been scheduled with not that lady,

223
00:09:05,972 --> 00:09:09,073
but this lady for months to get in,

224
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:11,701
and today she did it, and
she did such a good job.

225
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,534
- [Jared] It looks great.

226
00:09:12,534 --> 00:09:13,367
Give me another spin.

227
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,126
- I told her she's my new best friend.

228
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:16,959
- [Jared] Ellie--

229
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,856
- She cut a few inches and colored it.

230
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:20,457
- [Jared] Yeah, it's a lot
shorter, and it's colored.

231
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:21,290
- Thank you.

232
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,678
- It looks just very, okay,

233
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:25,288
my terminology with hair--

234
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:26,121
- I'll say it.

235
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,312
- I have no idea what I'm
talk, looks really healthy.

236
00:09:28,312 --> 00:09:29,471
- It does. Thank you.

237
00:09:29,471 --> 00:09:31,874
- It looks really good, Ellie.

238
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,422
I'm really happy for you.

239
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:34,315
- Well, thanks.

240
00:09:34,315 --> 00:09:36,607
Jared is very happy for me
when I go get stuff done

241
00:09:36,607 --> 00:09:40,495
for myself, like extra nice,
and it makes me feel good

242
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:42,455
as a mom and as a wife.

243
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:43,807
Thank you.
- Well, you deserve it.

244
00:09:43,807 --> 00:09:46,078
- I thought we were gonna
do a little hair haul.

245
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:49,003
- Yes, I just noticed that I
have this on my nose still.

246
00:09:49,003 --> 00:09:49,836
- [Ellie] I know.

247
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,109
- From my Instagram post.

248
00:09:51,109 --> 00:09:52,899
That's a heart on my
nose, if you can't tell.

249
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,649
- My first haul is 100
Tootsie Roll wrappers.

250
00:09:58,173 --> 00:10:00,243
When I checked out, I was like
I'm gonna eat all of these

251
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:01,428
while they check me out.

252
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,849
- I'm glad you didn't save me
any, because I'm working hard.

253
00:10:03,849 --> 00:10:04,682
- I ate a lot.

254
00:10:04,682 --> 00:10:06,557
I always use some purple shampoo.

255
00:10:06,557 --> 00:10:09,636
Every other time I wash my
hair, I'll use a purple shampoo,

256
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:12,455
but she said to use a
purple conditioner, so I got

257
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:16,655
Bumble and bumble tone enhancer
cool purple conditioner,

258
00:10:16,655 --> 00:10:19,127
and then I got one other
thing that she used.

259
00:10:19,127 --> 00:10:21,811
It's called Oribe is the brand.

260
00:10:21,811 --> 00:10:23,814
It's royal blowout.

261
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:25,814
It's just supposed to help
make your hair dry faster

262
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:27,814
and be silky and smooth.

263
00:10:28,891 --> 00:10:29,724
That's my hair haul.

264
00:10:29,724 --> 00:10:30,557
- [Jared] That's a cool little haul.

265
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:31,390
- Do you like it?

266
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,223
- [Jared] Yeah, it looks great.

267
00:10:32,223 --> 00:10:33,056
- Well, thanks, Jar.

268
00:10:33,056 --> 00:10:33,993
- [Jared] Jackson, do you notice

269
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:35,441
anything different about mom?

270
00:10:35,441 --> 00:10:36,755
- Do I look different?

271
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:37,588
- Yeah.

272
00:10:37,588 --> 00:10:38,703
- [Jared] What happened to mom?

273
00:10:38,703 --> 00:10:39,630
- Haircut.

274
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,681
- Yeah!
(laughs)

275
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:45,082
Okay, guys, if you want
major, major brownie points

276
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:48,951
with your partner, spouse,
husband, wife, or anything,

277
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:52,722
especially the wives, notice
when they do something.

278
00:10:52,722 --> 00:10:54,711
If you notice that
their hair is different,

279
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:56,878
their eyebrows are different,
their mascara's different,

280
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:58,958
their makeup is different--
- You're cute.

281
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,855
- You will get major
brownie points for noticing.

282
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:01,981
- You're cute.

283
00:11:01,981 --> 00:11:04,492
You just want me to kiss you.

284
00:11:04,492 --> 00:11:06,013
- It gives me the motivation I need.

285
00:11:06,013 --> 00:11:07,110
(laughs)

286
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,521
- I like Penny the best when we're eating,

287
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:13,382
because she sits right
here, and she just waits,

288
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,874
and she just sits the
whole time I'm eating.

289
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,567
Penny, are you ready?

290
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,564
You've been such a good girl.

291
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:20,397
You can see.

292
00:11:20,397 --> 00:11:21,419
Is that soft?

293
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,252
Soft.

294
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,067
Good girl.

295
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:26,304
It's my favorite.

296
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,642
When we eat, she just stares and sits.

297
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:29,475
- [Jared] Yeah, she's a good girl.

298
00:11:29,475 --> 00:11:31,786
- [Ellie] She just stops
moving for a minute.

299
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:32,619
- [Jared] Freeze!

300
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:33,656
- Now, the rest is for me.

301
00:11:33,656 --> 00:11:34,554
Go away!

302
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:39,243
I just had the strongest
feeling to check on Calvin,

303
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:40,519
and I'm out of breath now.

304
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,352
I was just thinking.

305
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,095
I was like, "I need to check on Calvin,"

306
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,478
and I walked in his room, and he was gone,

307
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:47,692
and he walked out the front door.

308
00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:48,942
He was outside,

309
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:54,480
and I don't know if I get
mad or if I just hug him

310
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,498
and be grateful.

311
00:11:55,498 --> 00:11:57,769
I don't even know what to do.

312
00:11:57,769 --> 00:11:58,668
I'm gonna get mad, though.

313
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,418
You don't go outside.

314
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:04,061
Calvin, I don't even know what to do.

315
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,978
Calvin, that's naughty.

316
00:12:07,881 --> 00:12:09,631
Don't you go outside.

317
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,501
K, we're gonna go to bed.

318
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:16,545
We don't open doors.

319
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:19,739
That was naughty, and flipping worried,

320
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,572
like what the heck?

321
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,185
He knows how to unlock doors.

322
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:23,950
He knows how to open doors.

323
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,566
That was really scary with Calvin leaving,

324
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:28,508
especially with him
waking up at three A.M.

325
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:29,919
and going downstairs, playing with toys

326
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,146
that you guys saw yesterday.

327
00:12:32,146 --> 00:12:34,006
Like I said, I didn't
know if I should be mad,

328
00:12:34,006 --> 00:12:36,136
or if I should hold him,
or if I should do both

329
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:37,266
before I put him to bed.

330
00:12:37,266 --> 00:12:39,880
I definitely was firm and
had him look at the door

331
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,691
and say that was naughty.

332
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:46,305
We have an alarm system, and
the door, everything chimes

333
00:12:46,305 --> 00:12:47,990
if a door or window opens,

334
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,853
but we're gonna turn that volume up,

335
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,621
I'm gonna get a baby lock
and put it on the front door,

336
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,393
so, if he tries to open it,
he can take baby locks off,

337
00:12:55,393 --> 00:12:58,423
but it takes him a long time to do that.

338
00:12:58,423 --> 00:13:00,708
I'm gonna do that, and then
I think we might even have

339
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:03,088
the alarm set even while we're home

340
00:13:03,088 --> 00:13:05,308
if the door's open type of thing

341
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,525
just so we can get this
under wraps for a minute.

342
00:13:08,525 --> 00:13:10,452
Calvin's getting into
an adventurous stage,

343
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,068
and I think that that's
the steps we need to take.

344
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:16,139
Jackson was never like
this, and he still isn't.

345
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,714
He asks if he wants to go outside.

346
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,584
He doesn't just go outside.

347
00:13:19,584 --> 00:13:21,402
Today, he asked if he could
go to his friend's house,

348
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,840
and I said no, it was time for bed,

349
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,977
and it's just interesting.

350
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:27,745
Each kid is interesting,
and this is a new experience

351
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:30,373
that just happened that
I have to take some steps

352
00:13:30,373 --> 00:13:32,424
to figure that out.

353
00:13:32,424 --> 00:13:35,214
Crazy. Thank you guys
so much for watching.

354
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,221
Parenting is so fun yet so hard.

355
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:39,318
I think I totally have
to add one more thing,

356
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,799
because this is such a big deal.

357
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,538
I really want people to know
that I'm taking it seriously.

358
00:13:44,538 --> 00:13:48,012
Usually, at night, Calvin falls
asleep with the door open.

359
00:13:48,012 --> 00:13:50,152
He falls asleep really
well if the door's open,

360
00:13:50,152 --> 00:13:51,917
and then, before we go
to bed, we close it,

361
00:13:51,917 --> 00:13:53,751
and he does have a baby lock on there,

362
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:56,235
so, if he ever does get
up, we can hear him,

363
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,602
because it takes him forever
to get that lock off,

364
00:13:58,602 --> 00:14:00,730
but, that night that he
woke up and was playing,

365
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,810
we forgot to close the door.

366
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,440
Again, his door is closed with a lock.

367
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,779
It's just, there's just so many things,

368
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,936
and I wanna express
everything, 'cause sometimes

369
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,158
you miss little bits,
and it's just a big deal,

370
00:14:16,158 --> 00:14:18,070
and it worries me that he was out there,

371
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,595
and I was very, my
stomach's kind of in knots

372
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:22,428
because of it.

373
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,580
Anyway, he's in bed.

374
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,413
He's safe.

375
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:25,246
I'm going to bed.

376
00:14:25,246 --> 00:14:26,886
We will see you guys on Saturday.

377
00:14:26,886 --> 00:14:28,416
We will have everything in the description

378
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,629
if you guys wanna come see us in L.A.,

379
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,578
and we'll see you guys later.

380
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:34,246
This mama's going to bed.

381
00:14:34,246 --> 00:14:36,712
Doors are locked, alarm is
on, and I'm going to bed.

382
00:14:36,712 --> 00:00:00,000
See you, bye.
