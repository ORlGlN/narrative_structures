1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:04,347
- Good morning guys, and Happy
New Year, welcome to 2018,

2
00:00:04,347 --> 00:00:05,354
Ellie
- Excuse me.

3
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:07,039
- Ellie and I
- Pickin' up.

4
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,010
(laughing)

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,471
- Woo, hey, that's my camera.

6
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:13,638
Ellie and I want to make 2018
our best year ever on YouTube,

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,315
in our personal lives and
everywhere in between.

8
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:19,672
But we need your help.

9
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:22,672
We want to ask you about everything.

10
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:25,495
We have questions for you and so

11
00:00:25,495 --> 00:00:27,762
in the description down
below, I have a survey

12
00:00:27,762 --> 00:00:30,771
that it would mean everything to us

13
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,194
if you would take just a couple minutes

14
00:00:32,194 --> 00:00:33,840
of your time and fill out.

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,982
They're questions about
the children's book,

16
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:38,324
questions about what we film on YouTube,

17
00:00:38,324 --> 00:00:40,832
questions about what you
would like to see more of,

18
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:44,197
less of, something that
you've never seen before.

19
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:46,344
We want you guys to take
just a couple minutes

20
00:00:46,344 --> 00:00:48,148
of your time and fill that survey out

21
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:52,315
so we know how we can make 2018
the best for you and for us.

22
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:56,189
Because when we work together,

23
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:58,044
we make some amazing things happen.

24
00:00:58,044 --> 00:01:00,831
And I'm really excited for
2018 because it is going

25
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:03,803
to be a great year in
so many different ways.

26
00:01:03,803 --> 00:01:06,380
So like I said if you wouldn't
mind doing this for me

27
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,099
and for Ellie and for the kids

28
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:09,736
and for YouTube and all of that.

29
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,420
Check out the link in the description,

30
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,600
it's a Google survey, you
just type in the information,

31
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,879
then answer the questions
and then it's all set to go,

32
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,150
Ellie and I look at all of that

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,790
and then we are gonna make decision

34
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,475
on how 2018 goes based on
what you guys have told us.

35
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:27,944
So thank you in advance, we
appreciate this so very much,

36
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:32,210
we are grateful for you guys
every single day, from 2014,

37
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,407
when we started this to 2018
we're still going strong.

38
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:39,025
Thank you guys, so much, I appreciate you

39
00:01:39,025 --> 00:01:41,416
and now to the, pregnancy update.

40
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,772
- So it has been a minute

41
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:45,470
since I did a update with you guys.

42
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,008
I talk, I try and talk in the blog,

43
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:51,517
openly how I'm feeling,
day to day with pregnancy

44
00:01:51,517 --> 00:01:54,207
but I do like to sit down
and talk about everything

45
00:01:54,207 --> 00:01:55,581
that's been going on.

46
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:58,018
The last time I updated
you guys I was 11 weeks

47
00:01:58,018 --> 00:02:00,972
and I did a cute little
artsy way of updating you,

48
00:02:00,972 --> 00:02:03,127
and to be honest my kids
are not having it today,

49
00:02:03,127 --> 00:02:05,654
and I didn't have it in me,

50
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:07,833
so I'm gonna sit down and
just talk with you guys.

51
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:10,333
I am 14 weeks along right now.

52
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:15,703
And the baby is the size of a peach

53
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:18,699
and I've been using the app The Bump

54
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:22,799
and I downloaded a ton of
apps for my last pregnancy

55
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,052
and I was kind of going through seeing

56
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:27,362
which one was my favorite and
this was by far my favorite.

57
00:02:27,362 --> 00:02:31,409
And when I deleted it, it
was honestly more emotional

58
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,079
than I thought it would
be deleting the app,

59
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,553
because it was like I finally found an app

60
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:37,015
that I really liked and
then I had to delete it

61
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:39,426
'cause I miscarried and I
didn't want to see any updates,

62
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,404
so I am happy to have it back.

63
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:43,730
Try not to get emotional.

64
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,115
But I'm 14 weeks and it just talks

65
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:48,873
about the baby's sucking his thumb now

66
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:50,166
and the baby's wiggling,

67
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:54,747
the baby's kidneys are
starting to do its job.

68
00:02:54,747 --> 00:02:57,792
It just talks all about how
the baby is doing at 14 weeks.

69
00:02:57,792 --> 00:03:00,378
And this is Jackson's
favorite part of the app,

70
00:03:00,378 --> 00:03:04,465
it shows how big the baby
is, so I click on the baby

71
00:03:04,465 --> 00:03:06,096
and it's kind of like a 3D version

72
00:03:06,096 --> 00:03:08,327
that you can rotate the baby around,

73
00:03:08,327 --> 00:03:10,268
you can see his toes, and see his eyes

74
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:13,018
and just how the baby has been forming

75
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:15,258
and so it's been really fun,

76
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:16,723
not just for me to have this app,

77
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:17,994
but for me to just lay down

78
00:03:17,994 --> 00:03:20,292
and Jackson to say let's
see what the baby looks like

79
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:22,298
and we go through and look at that.

80
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,759
So that is the app and it
has like questions too,

81
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,259
where it what most people ask at 14 weeks,

82
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,789
and so a lot of those
questions I have wondered.

83
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:33,935
Like how to get rid of headaches,

84
00:03:33,935 --> 00:03:35,174
how to do this, how to do that.

85
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:36,476
And it answers questions.

86
00:03:36,476 --> 00:03:38,478
So that's why I have liked the app.

87
00:03:38,478 --> 00:03:42,141
But Jarrod and I's genetic
test came back for the baby,

88
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:43,876
we did genetic testing this time around

89
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,903
because I did have two miscarriages

90
00:03:45,903 --> 00:03:47,495
and I thought if I were to happen

91
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:49,992
to have another miscarriage
I'd want to have

92
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:52,646
as much information as possible to see

93
00:03:52,646 --> 00:03:55,875
if anything is going on with the baby.

94
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,713
And the genetic testing
all came back A-Okay,

95
00:03:58,713 --> 00:04:00,522
everything looks great.

96
00:04:00,522 --> 00:04:03,263
The baby, we also found out the gender,

97
00:04:03,263 --> 00:04:06,540
we are having a boy, you guys know that,

98
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,764
but we are so thrilled to
have three boys in our house.

99
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:13,802
I can't, I can't smack
the smile off my face

100
00:04:13,802 --> 00:04:15,367
but I also can't believe

101
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,708
that Ellie is having three boys it's just,

102
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,390
it just makes me laugh.

103
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,223
It's fun.

104
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:24,390
My cravings this last week
has completely leveled out.

105
00:04:25,527 --> 00:04:27,201
I'm happy to eat whatever,

106
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:31,313
I still kind of don't like sugary foods,

107
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,281
like if I eat it I feel like crap

108
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,350
so I have been sticking
to more rice, and beans

109
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,729
and salads and I do like
cereals, I like bread a lot.

110
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,570
But the one craving that
has stuck around is eggs,

111
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,515
and not just any eggs, boiled eggs.

112
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:46,972
I really like boiled eggs,

113
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:49,136
every morning I have
boiled eggs, some avocado,

114
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:52,641
salt and pepper on there
and it seriously is amazing.

115
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,626
I'm not one to drink lots of
water, I really like Gatorade,

116
00:04:56,626 --> 00:05:00,268
I like juices, but I have
been drinking plain water

117
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:03,274
with ice and normally I
like my water just nice

118
00:05:03,274 --> 00:05:06,822
and almost lukewarm, 'cause
I think it hurts my teeth

119
00:05:06,822 --> 00:05:09,500
and stuff, but I like
it as cold as it can be

120
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,682
and I drink a lot of
water which is awesome.

121
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:15,465
The hardest thing from the
beginning of the pregnancy

122
00:05:15,465 --> 00:05:18,626
until now is my headaches have been

123
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:20,902
by far the worst I have ever had.

124
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:24,558
And I was almost tempted to
go get that piercing where

125
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:28,713
it helps your migraines, I
think it's called the Dayarth,

126
00:05:28,713 --> 00:05:30,372
or something, I don't
know what it's called.

127
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,338
It starts with a D.

128
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:32,905
Yeah I was really tempted to do that.

129
00:05:32,905 --> 00:05:35,544
My brother-in-law is awesome
and he is worked on me

130
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,267
and helped me get everything back in place

131
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:41,545
and he's done that three
times and then the last four

132
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:44,185
or five days I've had a headache straight,

133
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,427
Christmas I was out for
a few hours with like,

134
00:05:46,427 --> 00:05:49,929
I couldn't look at the light,
it was so unbelievably bad,

135
00:05:49,929 --> 00:05:53,086
and so today I called in
and I got to a chiropractor

136
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,920
and right this second I feel really good.

137
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,174
And I am so grateful
that she had an opening,

138
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:01,991
but I went to the chiropractor
and just worked me up,

139
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:04,171
lots of cracks, lots of positionings,

140
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:07,153
lots of putting my bones
and muscles back in place

141
00:06:07,153 --> 00:06:09,270
and I feel so much better.

142
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:10,746
So that is something that I'm going

143
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,748
to be doing once a week
is going to a chiropractor

144
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,971
and so I can just keep things aligned.

145
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:18,087
It's the weirdest thing,
I would move my neck

146
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,075
and you could hear it cracking.

147
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:22,523
But now that I move my neck
you don't hear anything

148
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,533
at all because everything's back in place.

149
00:06:24,533 --> 00:06:25,958
It was the craziest thing.

150
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,469
I went to twitter because you
guys have lots of question

151
00:06:29,469 --> 00:06:31,640
and I'm not always able to
always answer all of them.

152
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,823
So I asked you guys what questions you had

153
00:06:33,823 --> 00:06:36,234
and I said but don't talk about baby names

154
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:39,304
because I try to keep
you guys updated already,

155
00:06:39,304 --> 00:06:42,672
the baby name we are thinking of is Mason,

156
00:06:42,672 --> 00:06:46,486
we haven't had any other baby
names that have come to mind,

157
00:06:46,486 --> 00:06:48,983
but we also haven't thought
of other baby names.

158
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:50,313
But we're going on a
road trick tomorrow so,

159
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,681
we are going to be picking
a baby name for sure.

160
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,372
I'm gonna try and go
down the list pretty fast

161
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:58,282
so I can answer as many of your
guys questions as possible.

162
00:06:58,282 --> 00:07:00,377
Is there anything you wish
you would do differently

163
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:02,241
when the baby is born that you didn't do

164
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:03,626
with Jackson and Calvin.

165
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:04,892
Not that I can think of right now,

166
00:07:04,892 --> 00:07:06,962
but something that I
want to do differently

167
00:07:06,962 --> 00:07:08,603
with the pregnancy that I didn't do

168
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:11,559
with Jackson and Calvin is I've
never had maternity photos.

169
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:14,630
And in my thinking is, I
always take 100 photos anyway,

170
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,878
I don't need to go get maternity photos,

171
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:19,478
'cause I always take
pictures of my belly anyway,

172
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:21,320
but I think that is
something that I want to do

173
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,141
with this pregnancy is do an
actual maternity photo shoot.

174
00:07:25,141 --> 00:07:26,724
I don't regret not doing
it with the others,

175
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:29,875
but I think I would like to
at least have some photos

176
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,274
of me professionally done being pregnant.

177
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:34,834
How have you found this pregnancy compared

178
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,012
to Jackson and Calvin's pregnancies.

179
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:39,724
I would say I was definitely
sicker in the beginning,

180
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:42,423
with Jackson and Calvin I
didn't have multiple days

181
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:46,175
of me just laying in bed, being
like, I'm done for the day.

182
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,539
So I would definitely say

183
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,479
this pregnancy has already
been just a little harder.

184
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,617
But it hasn't wiped me out completely

185
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:55,559
where it's like I'm not even functionable.

186
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,541
I mean there are some people

187
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:58,963
that have really hard pregnancies

188
00:07:58,963 --> 00:08:01,938
and I'm really grateful
that mine haven't been.

189
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:03,092
I would say the headaches,

190
00:08:03,092 --> 00:08:05,334
have been the absolute worst though.

191
00:08:05,334 --> 00:08:08,022
How do you think Calvin will
adjust to being a big brother.

192
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:11,653
I think that Calvin is very loving

193
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:14,485
and I think that he is
going to adjust well

194
00:08:14,485 --> 00:08:16,318
with a baby brother.

195
00:08:16,318 --> 00:08:18,743
I won't be surprised if at
first it takes him a minute

196
00:08:18,743 --> 00:08:20,357
to warm to a baby though.

197
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:22,223
I think that's not going to surprise me.

198
00:08:22,223 --> 00:08:24,010
I feel like overall he's gonna

199
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,994
be a very loving brother though.

200
00:08:25,994 --> 00:08:27,640
Animal of choice for baby?

201
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,473
That is so funny.

202
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:29,581
I don't have one yet.

203
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:31,309
I think when we have the name

204
00:08:31,309 --> 00:08:34,241
for the baby the animal might come sooner.

205
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:36,118
I've never really planned
this, but Jackson,

206
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:38,575
it was like the animal
for him was giraffes

207
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:39,869
and with this baby I don't know

208
00:08:39,869 --> 00:08:43,306
what his little animal will
be that Mom decides for him

209
00:08:43,306 --> 00:08:45,089
but I need to think of one.

210
00:08:45,089 --> 00:08:46,611
I need to feel it out.

211
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:47,629
Does this pregnancy feel different

212
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:50,287
to how you've carried Jackson and Calvin,

213
00:08:50,287 --> 00:08:52,531
if so what's different?

214
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:56,448
It's crazy how fast you
feel things that I used

215
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:00,138
to feel when I was like 20 weeks.

216
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:03,111
28 weeks, like further along.

217
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:06,376
Like my back, I can feel
that my back is hurting,

218
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:09,094
I can feel that my hips have been hurting.

219
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:12,178
For a few days straight
I was a little worried

220
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,748
because my stomach was cramping so much,

221
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:17,628
and I kept thinking I
just want to play it low,

222
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:20,511
I just want to get off my feet

223
00:09:20,511 --> 00:09:21,975
because I was honestly worried,

224
00:09:21,975 --> 00:09:25,194
because I was just so crampy,
but I feel really good now

225
00:09:25,194 --> 00:09:28,324
and I just had a lot of ligament pain,

226
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:32,491
a lot of my stomach grew a
lot between 12 and 14 weeks

227
00:09:33,693 --> 00:09:36,049
and I feel like I was just
going through a growth spurt.

228
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:39,092
And I could just feel all of those pains.

229
00:09:39,092 --> 00:09:42,049
So I definitely have
felt a lot more early on,

230
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,706
I definitely have a harder
time with acne right now.

231
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:47,250
I've had a hard time getting rid of it

232
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,512
I feel like I look okay,
I'm ready for the day,

233
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:52,283
I've got some makeup on,
but I do have a lot redness,

234
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,642
hormonal redness going on.

235
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,762
When are you going to move
Calvin's room to downstairs

236
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,346
and set up the nursery.

237
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:01,148
Probably in the spring, we'll
probably get through January,

238
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:03,471
February and then that
will give us like a boost

239
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:05,793
for the spring to set up rooms.

240
00:10:05,793 --> 00:10:08,543
So that's going to be really fun.

241
00:10:11,864 --> 00:10:14,150
Do you have any smell aversions.

242
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,395
No the hardest time with the smells was

243
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:18,774
when I was very first
pregnant and I was in China.

244
00:10:18,774 --> 00:10:20,980
That was the hardest 'cause
there was just lots of smoke,

245
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,115
lots of different smells like animal meat,

246
00:10:24,115 --> 00:10:26,230
when I went into the restaurants.

247
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,088
It was just really different from home,

248
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:31,835
so that was probably my hardest
time with smell aversions.

249
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:32,720
What are things you take

250
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,159
and considering when choosing a baby name.

251
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,659
I like to name all of the kids

252
00:10:39,204 --> 00:10:42,304
and then end with the
baby name I'm considering.

253
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:45,086
Just so I feel like it flows well.

254
00:10:45,086 --> 00:10:48,602
I really like how my family
flows, like all the names.

255
00:10:48,602 --> 00:10:50,602
I like how Jackson and Calvin flow,

256
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:53,362
so I definitely like
the flow of the names.

257
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,033
I definitely don't think it has to start

258
00:10:55,033 --> 00:10:57,733
with a certain letter or
end with a certain letter.

259
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:00,965
Just as long as it sounds
nice with the other names.

260
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:03,266
How are you feeling with the
age gap between the boys.

261
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:05,158
Do you wish Jackson and Calvin were older,

262
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:06,846
do you feel like it's going
to be a good experience

263
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:09,044
for both to have a little brother

264
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:12,925
'cause the differences will
be a little more evident.

265
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,888
We definitely planned on
the age gap it is now,

266
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:18,354
I mean we wanted a baby a little sooner,

267
00:11:18,354 --> 00:11:21,522
you know that's why tried a lot sooner,

268
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:24,669
but I think the gap is perfect.

269
00:11:24,669 --> 00:11:27,524
We kind of, Jarrod and I
always had talked about hoping

270
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:30,409
to have a baby when
Calvin was around three

271
00:11:30,409 --> 00:11:32,957
and that will be the case.

272
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:35,133
And so I'm really happy with the age gap,

273
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:38,856
I love that Jackson and
Calvin are so close in age

274
00:11:38,856 --> 00:11:42,757
and this baby will have a three
year gap which is between me

275
00:11:42,757 --> 00:11:45,261
and my sister Julie,
we're three years apart.

276
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:48,837
So I think, I think
that that will be good.

277
00:11:48,837 --> 00:11:51,391
I don't know any different,
so I don't really know.

278
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,420
But, I like it.

279
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,197
Back to animals for the kids.

280
00:11:55,197 --> 00:11:56,605
Someone's like Jackson was a giraffe

281
00:11:56,605 --> 00:11:57,761
and Calvin had a turtle.

282
00:11:57,761 --> 00:12:00,321
Calvin totally, like
it was a turtle theme.

283
00:12:00,321 --> 00:12:03,490
But when he was a baby I had
planned on it being elephants,

284
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,214
but it kind of turned into turtles, so,

285
00:12:05,214 --> 00:12:07,090
I do want to throw that out there.

286
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,923
That's funny.

287
00:12:07,923 --> 00:12:09,009
Is there a reason you guys liked Mason

288
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:10,494
or was it a random name.

289
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,165
Mason was a completely random name,

290
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:15,370
that's why I'm not
saying it's his name yet

291
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,494
because I feel like Jarrod
and I should go through

292
00:12:18,494 --> 00:12:22,280
some family names and some history names

293
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,074
and just see if any of those settle.

294
00:12:25,074 --> 00:12:26,468
Just as well as Mason.

295
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:28,918
But I really like Mason too.

296
00:12:28,918 --> 00:12:30,943
So we still want to go
through some more but,

297
00:12:30,943 --> 00:12:34,454
obviously that's still top on my list.

298
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,463
Are you going to be doing a birth vlog.

299
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:37,296
We are.

300
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,462
Those are some of my
favorite memories is being

301
00:12:40,462 --> 00:12:43,790
in the hospital, and capturing
some of those moments.

302
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,670
So we did a birth vlog of the other two

303
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,503
and we definitely do plan

304
00:12:46,503 --> 00:12:49,313
on doing a birth vlog with this baby.

305
00:12:49,313 --> 00:12:51,254
The one thing that will
be different though is

306
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,921
it won't be posted the next day.

307
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,316
That was really hard for me,

308
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:02,128
having both of the babies
being in the hospital

309
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:04,641
and Jarrod was there but
he wasn't really there

310
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:05,774
'cause he was on his computer

311
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:07,708
until really late at night editing

312
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,242
and that was really hard on me.

313
00:13:09,242 --> 00:13:12,063
So I think that we'll
definitely have a day

314
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:15,490
to be with our family and to rest

315
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,930
and to get our first
good night nights rest

316
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,155
and then for sure the
birth vlog will be up.

317
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:22,009
Have you noticed any personality changes

318
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,927
other than being hangry of course.

319
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:27,442
To be honest, absolutely, and
it does make me a little sad.

320
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,149
I have been so irritable.

321
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,991
I have been a little cranky,
I've been a little short,

322
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:36,595
I've really tried not to
but I feel like sometimes

323
00:13:36,595 --> 00:13:39,630
it's like you just can't
even flippin' handle it.

324
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:40,463
(laughing)

325
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:43,640
You are just are like, and I
really try and like breathe

326
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,852
and calm down and express my
feelings and express like,

327
00:13:46,852 --> 00:13:49,712
I'm gonna lose it, I
need everyone to help me

328
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:52,678
or I need this and, but yes, I am,

329
00:13:52,678 --> 00:13:57,050
I think part of it is because
my head has been hurting

330
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:59,456
and when you don't feel
well, like you guys know,

331
00:13:59,456 --> 00:14:01,378
when you don't feel well it's like,

332
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:04,372
(moans) just everything you're just upset,

333
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:05,562
like you just don't feel well.

334
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:09,044
And so, definitely, I would
say other than being hangry,

335
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:10,980
I have probably not been the most pleasant

336
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,890
to be around all the time.

337
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,083
Do you agree with that Jarrod?

338
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:14,916
- [Jarrod] Yeah.

339
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,063
( Jarrod and Elsie laughing)

340
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,171
- What do you think, be honest.

341
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,028
- [Jarrod] If I'm being honest I can,

342
00:14:19,028 --> 00:14:21,962
I can definitely see why
things are frustrating to you,

343
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,329
but that's just a part of the thing

344
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:24,508
that we have to go through.

345
00:14:24,508 --> 00:14:26,268
I love you no matter what.

346
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:27,494
- Well you're sweet.

347
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,381
- [Jarrod] And I want
to do everything I can

348
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:30,625
to make sure you're taken care of.

349
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:31,654
- Well you're sweet, thanks.

350
00:14:31,654 --> 00:14:32,592
- [Jarrod] I love you.

351
00:14:32,592 --> 00:14:33,920
- This was awesome question,

352
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,934
what is one thing that you used

353
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:38,346
with the last two pregnancies
that you are using again.

354
00:14:38,346 --> 00:14:39,897
(sighs) Lush.

355
00:14:39,897 --> 00:14:43,368
Lush I've been using you
for years and I love you.

356
00:14:43,368 --> 00:14:47,347
This is a massage bar and if
you look on their website,

357
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:48,516
you'll see it.

358
00:14:48,516 --> 00:14:50,977
I never know the name of
it but you will see it.

359
00:14:50,977 --> 00:14:52,711
And if you go in, they are so good

360
00:14:52,711 --> 00:14:54,435
to know what you're talking about.

361
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,279
This is for pregnancy and
you use it on your belly,

362
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,506
you rub it and it doesn't
leave the oily or greasy.

363
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,818
And this lasts me the full nine months.

364
00:15:04,818 --> 00:15:08,594
I used one full one with Jackson,
one full one with Calvin,

365
00:15:08,594 --> 00:15:11,927
this one with this baby
and just like every day,

366
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:14,355
every other day I'll
just rub it on my belly,

367
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:17,653
two or three times and then
I'll rub it into my belly

368
00:15:17,653 --> 00:15:20,336
and I'll rub it really low
down, like on my hips too,

369
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,802
and it just is really good
to moisturize your stomach.

370
00:15:23,802 --> 00:15:26,108
I've never had any stretchmarks,
I don't want to say

371
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:27,973
that this didn't make
me get stretch marks,

372
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:29,383
I think you get 'em or you don't,

373
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:33,307
but it has been really good
in moisturizing my skin

374
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,755
and especially when you're more like five

375
00:15:35,755 --> 00:15:37,950
to eight months pregnant
and you're really hurting

376
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,720
and you're really sore, sometimes itchy,

377
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,265
when you rub it on you belly,
it's just really cooling

378
00:15:43,265 --> 00:15:45,751
and it just feels good
to be able to rub it

379
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:48,277
into your belly and it
kind of helps massage

380
00:15:48,277 --> 00:15:50,646
and lift up your belly.

381
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:53,474
I really liked using that
with the pregnancies.

382
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:55,465
Do you think it'll be a
big adjustment for Calvin

383
00:15:55,465 --> 00:15:58,074
to take on a big brother
role for the first time.

384
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,001
How do you think he'll cope

385
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,601
with having a new baby in the house.

386
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,447
Jackson's probably thinking,
pshh, this is a piece of cake.

387
00:16:03,447 --> 00:16:05,120
I know I kind of already answered this,

388
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,474
but Calvin, lately
(roaring)

389
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,552
I've been putting a little
bit more expectations

390
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,385
on Calvin and I've been
asking more of Calvin,

391
00:16:15,383 --> 00:16:16,578
I guess you could say.

392
00:16:16,578 --> 00:16:19,418
Even as simple as Calvin,
come throw this away,

393
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,197
Calvin come help me put this away.

394
00:16:21,197 --> 00:16:23,440
'Cause Jackson is always
willing to be helpful

395
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,318
if I ask him to do
something he's fairly good

396
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,728
to listen and do it.

397
00:16:27,728 --> 00:16:30,320
And I've been trying
to put the expectation

398
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,785
on Calvin as well.

399
00:16:31,785 --> 00:16:33,475
Even just little things,

400
00:16:33,475 --> 00:16:36,062
like after he's done
eating his cereal bowls,

401
00:16:36,062 --> 00:16:37,536
come bring that over here.

402
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:41,722
I mean even though those have
nothing to do with a brother,

403
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:45,387
I think it has to do with
listening and behaving

404
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:47,241
and I feel like when the baby comes,

405
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,268
he's gonna be excited when I say,

406
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:51,035
can you help me find a binky

407
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:52,828
or can you get the baby a blanket.

408
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:56,995
I think that kids love to
please and they love to help and

409
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,844
- [Child] And maybe the baby
will love the green blanket.

410
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:04,555
- Oh and maybe the baby
will have the green blanket.

411
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:05,476
(laughing)

412
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:10,054
Overall I do think that
Calvin is going to be really,

413
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:11,634
I think he'll be really good.

414
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,835
Have you been feeling any movement.

415
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:16,906
I tweeted, like two weeks
ago, that I was like,

416
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:18,825
I think I just felt the baby move,

417
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:22,618
and I probably have felt
the baby move four times

418
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:25,434
and I know, it has to have been the baby,

419
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:27,676
it is the best feeling

420
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:30,333
and it has been so subtle
that's why I've kind of

421
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,910
been a little quiet about it.

422
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:35,042
But like, the nights
where if I'm just sitting

423
00:17:35,042 --> 00:17:38,120
and it's completely quiet and
I'm completely just sitting,

424
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,463
I will feel a little flutter

425
00:17:40,463 --> 00:17:43,468
and there's been two times
that I've been (gasps)

426
00:17:43,468 --> 00:17:46,781
and I've looked at Jarrod
like that was the baby.

427
00:17:46,781 --> 00:17:49,377
So, I definitely have felt some movement,

428
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:52,785
but not tons and tons, I
want to start feeling it more

429
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:54,780
to get even more excited,

430
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,672
but I know that I have
felt the baby a few times.

431
00:17:57,672 --> 00:17:59,197
With the new baby coming and Calvin coming

432
00:17:59,197 --> 00:18:01,602
into your room during the
night have you put much thought

433
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,989
into putting Jackson and Calvin together.

434
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:07,359
I know I've seen a lot of
people comment to do it.

435
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:09,026
I have put so
- baby

436
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:13,178
- much thought into that,
and that is something

437
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,182
that Jarrod and I have to decide.

438
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:18,205
I've gone back and forth,
I think it's a great idea

439
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,569
if they're together, I can
think of a bajillion reasons

440
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:22,566
why they should have their separate room.

441
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:23,627
I've asked Jackson,

442
00:18:23,627 --> 00:18:27,147
Jackson do you want to
share a room with Calvin?

443
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,634
So you want him to sleep in your room?

444
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,640
Or do you want to have your own rooms?

445
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,812
- [Jackson] I want to have my own room.

446
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:33,645
- Your own room.

447
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,222
Jackson says he wants his
own room, Calvin says my bed.

448
00:18:36,222 --> 00:18:38,336
My answer right now is
they're probably gonna have

449
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:41,142
their own room and if
they would like to sleep

450
00:18:41,142 --> 00:18:44,745
in the same room and have
sleepovers on mattresses

451
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,253
or on their sleeping bags, absolutely.

452
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:48,601
But I think that their probably

453
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:49,954
all gonna have their own room.

454
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:52,192
- Well that was quite the
pregnancy update wouldn't you say?

455
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:54,884
- Yes, I hope I answered a
lot of you guys questions,

456
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:58,295
I like sitting down and answering them.

457
00:18:58,295 --> 00:19:00,597
- I like sitting down because
that's like a good opportunity

458
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,357
for me to hear everything in detail.

459
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:05,393
Because when we talk
- Instead of cranky

460
00:19:05,393 --> 00:19:06,226
(laughing)

461
00:19:06,226 --> 00:19:07,750
- No, I mean well that's part of it,

462
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,486
when we talk it's not
as in depth as you were

463
00:19:11,486 --> 00:19:13,783
to be uninterrupted, you know,

464
00:19:13,783 --> 00:19:15,234
well for the most part.
- Kind of.

465
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:16,478
So the kids were
- Yeah, same thing.

466
00:19:16,478 --> 00:19:17,311
- kind of going crazy.

467
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:18,144
(laughing)

468
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:19,692
You know what I mean, so it's
fun for to listen to as well.

469
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,812
- Tomorrow we are going
on a little road trip

470
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:24,446
for New Years, we're gonna
go see our friends Carl

471
00:19:24,446 --> 00:19:26,790
and Ginger and I told Jarrod, in the car

472
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,467
that is the perfect
opportunity, we're gonna sit

473
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:32,280
and just like talk about names,

474
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,494
we'll bring that book, where is it?

475
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:36,466
We'll a book, we have
like some family names.

476
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,299
- Yeah.

477
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:39,202
- We'll look at, have your
mom send a few family names

478
00:19:39,202 --> 00:19:41,697
and think about, we're excited.

479
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:42,819
- Yeah we really are excited,

480
00:19:42,819 --> 00:19:45,648
it's the beginning of a
brand new year for us.

481
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:47,196
And we're really excited about it.

482
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:49,571
Not just with the baby
but life in general.

483
00:19:49,571 --> 00:19:51,926
I really want to encourage you guys again

484
00:19:51,926 --> 00:19:54,174
to check out the survey that we have

485
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:55,643
in the description down below.

486
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:58,959
It's gonna help us out
a lot, to know exactly

487
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:01,465
what 2018 is going to look like

488
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:04,348
especially your feedback
is very much appreciated.

489
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:05,472
So check that out.

490
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:07,419
- I think that just like
life in general this year,

491
00:20:07,419 --> 00:20:10,276
like I've told Jarrod, with
our job, like with YouTube,

492
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:13,363
like a lot of times we do get up and go

493
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:15,918
and you know last year we got
a lot of cool opportunities,

494
00:20:15,918 --> 00:20:19,276
we got to go to do the Care Bear event,

495
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:23,422
we got to go to Vegas, like
stuff like that is so fun to do

496
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,535
and we will hopefully continue

497
00:20:25,535 --> 00:20:28,223
to have some opportunities
like that to do.

498
00:20:28,223 --> 00:20:30,193
But I am excited for a new year.

499
00:20:30,193 --> 00:20:32,381
Six months,
- Look at that.

500
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,083
six months, we'll be welcoming a new baby.

501
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,088
- Isn't that gonna be crazy.

502
00:20:35,088 --> 00:20:35,921
- Calvin,

503
00:20:35,921 --> 00:20:36,932
- You're gonna have a
brother in six months.

504
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:38,277
- [Elsie] Calvin people want to know,

505
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:41,133
how you're gonna react to not
being a baby of the family.

506
00:20:41,133 --> 00:20:42,341
- Are you a baby?

507
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,174
- Um, no.

508
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:44,984
- Nope, are you a big boy?

509
00:20:44,984 --> 00:20:45,817
- [Calvin] No.

510
00:20:45,817 --> 00:20:46,650
- [Jarrod] Wow.

511
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,259
- Are you a big boy?
- Are you a big boy?

512
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:49,092
- [Elsie] Calvin.
