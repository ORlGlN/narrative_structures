1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,158
- We are going to do something so special.

2
00:00:03,158 --> 00:00:05,042
- Family date night!
- Family date night!

3
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:06,276
- Yeah.
(howling)

4
00:00:06,276 --> 00:00:07,109
(enchanting tones)

5
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:08,350
Whoa!

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:11,640
And our next adventure is
just around the corner.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,530
- In a little over three months,

8
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,110
baby is coming.

9
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,810
And there is a handful of things

10
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:18,870
that we want to do with the kids

11
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,340
before baby comes.

12
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,820
One, I want to take Jackson
and Calvin on a date.

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,880
Both of the boys, all
about them, go on a date.

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,100
Then, we want to take the whole family,

15
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,670
the kids, Penny, Jared, our camper,

16
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,770
we want to go out, we want to
go on a little family trip.

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,050
Then, we want to take just Jackson

18
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,388
on his own date,

19
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:41,013
an all-day date just about Jackson.

20
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:44,630
Then an all-day date just about Calvin,

21
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,000
and maybe a date all about just Penny.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,900
But that is what we want
to do before baby comes.

23
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,350
And in a little over three months,

24
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,360
that seems like still far away away,

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,940
but to get all that done,

26
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,500
I think we should start now,

27
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,900
so let's take our boys on a date.

28
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,550
- Let's go on a date with our boys.

29
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:05,209
Alright boys, we are going
to do something so special,

30
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,410
but before we do it,

31
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,530
we have to go to the store.
- Where are we going?

32
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,302
- Which store do you think
we're going to go to?

33
00:01:11,302 --> 00:01:12,345
- The toy store!

34
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:14,289
- What toy store?

35
00:01:14,289 --> 00:01:15,361
- The Disney one.

36
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:16,309
- What?
- That' right.

37
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:17,414
- Are we gonna go in?

38
00:01:17,414 --> 00:01:18,247
- Should we go in the Disney store?

39
00:01:18,247 --> 00:01:19,080
- Yeah.

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,913
- Yeah, let's go.

41
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,496
(bright music)

42
00:01:41,947 --> 00:01:42,941
- Yeah.

43
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:43,837
- Yeah.

44
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,414
- Abracadabra.

45
00:01:45,414 --> 00:01:46,977
(enchanting tones)

46
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,227
- [Jared] Whoa!

47
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,810
(enchanting tones)

48
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,910
That was amazing Jackson.

49
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:55,880
- [Ellie] Jackson, look what I found?

50
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,380
It's Spiderman figurines.

51
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,830
- It's a bullet blaster.

52
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,730
- We are just hanging
out in our hotel room,

53
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,080
getting ready to take the kids

54
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,240
to their special date.

55
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,180
Jackson, let's see what you got.

56
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:14,090
The best Spiderman moves ever.

57
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,370
Jackson Clark doesn't even know

58
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,400
where we're going today.

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,390
He's going to be shocked.

60
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,330
- I'm not gonna be shocked.

61
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,800
- [Ellie] I think you will be.

62
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,671
Calvin, let's see what
you got, Calvin's got--

63
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:24,504
(Ellie gasps)

64
00:02:24,504 --> 00:02:26,190
What moves do you have?

65
00:02:27,502 --> 00:02:30,758
Aww, you lost the battle.

66
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:32,050
- Look at him play dead.

67
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:33,619
He's doing so great by playing dead.

68
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:34,580
(Ellie laughs)

69
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,970
- [Ellie] What moves do you have?

70
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,803
This one?

71
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,873
Whoa.
- Whoa.

72
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,270
The major cannonball extreme.

73
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,270
Whoa,
- Oh my gosh.

74
00:02:45,656 --> 00:02:46,904
- Yeah.

75
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:48,292
- [Ellie] Calvin.

76
00:02:48,292 --> 00:02:50,224
- This was his move.

77
00:02:50,224 --> 00:02:52,300
- [Ellie] That was his move.

78
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,133
- [Jared] Can you do it?

79
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:54,150
- [Ellie] Spiderman has one more thing

80
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,460
he would like to show us.

81
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,610
Let's see what you got.

82
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:59,215
Whoa.
- Whoa!

83
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:02,200
- [Ellie] It's almost like
there's Flash and Spiderman,

84
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,270
Flash and Spiderman.

85
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,570
Okay, let's see what you got Mr. Cal.

86
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:09,098
Jared, show us your moves.

87
00:03:09,098 --> 00:03:10,746
- I'm Ironman.

88
00:03:10,746 --> 00:03:12,220
- [Ellie] What?

89
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,960
I bet no one knew that Ironman
was coming to our room.

90
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,040
- Yeah, Ironman, get it?

91
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,398
Because it's an ironing board?

92
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:19,231
- Yeah.

93
00:03:19,231 --> 00:03:20,064
- Oh good.

94
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:20,897
(laughing)

95
00:03:20,897 --> 00:03:21,730
Okay, so here's the game plan.

96
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:24,220
We have three hours until
the main event today.

97
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
- Okay.

98
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:25,886
- Okay.

99
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:26,830
- Okay, so we gotta figure
out something to do.

100
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:29,542
I think one stop we
should do, is have lunch.

101
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,375
- Tots.

102
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:31,470
- Okay Mom, you're on lunch duty, okay?

103
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,303
- Okay.

104
00:03:32,303 --> 00:03:34,740
- Calvin, you're on car safety duty.

105
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,840
That means you make sure
everyone gets in their seats

106
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,240
and has their seat belts on.

107
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,790
Jackson, what duty do you want?

108
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,970
- Going to the kid places.

109
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,485
- The kid places duty.
- The kid places duty.

110
00:03:43,485 --> 00:03:45,350
- Okay and Daddy will be on driving duty.

111
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,510
- Family date night!
- Family date night!

112
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,550
- Yeah.
(howling)

113
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,730
(laughing)

114
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,260
- It would be fun to go to
a place we haven't been.

115
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,160
- [Jared] Yeah, it seems
like we've got a team effort

116
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,470
on the lunch duty.

117
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:58,510
Oh a place with a play area,

118
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,670
that could be fun.

119
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,632
- So are we wanting to go to
lunch now or probably before?

120
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:04,306
- [Jared] Maybe before we have our event.

121
00:04:04,306 --> 00:04:05,430
- Salt Lake City in--

122
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,870
- [Jared] Yeah.

123
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,334
These kids are getting anxious to go.

124
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:11,815
- I see Spiderman's city.

125
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,151
(bright music)

126
00:04:15,151 --> 00:04:16,079
There's the earth.

127
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,385
- [Jared] Is that the earth?

128
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,218
- Yeah.

129
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,051
- [Jared] Cool.

130
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:19,884
- So you're in charge
of kids' stuff today,

131
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:21,009
so where we should go?

132
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:22,792
- We're on the earth.

133
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:23,710
- We are.
- We are.

134
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,720
- I'm in charge the kids' stuff.

135
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,804
Let's go to the Clark Planetarium.

136
00:04:29,804 --> 00:04:31,440
- Perfect.
- You got it.

137
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,673
- [Jared] Oh what good Spiderman muscles.

138
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,620
- Wow.

139
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,650
- Is that cool?

140
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,520
We're not even in it
yet and you're excited.

141
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,210
- This isn't even the date.

142
00:04:40,193 --> 00:04:42,881
(bright atmospheric music)

143
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:43,810
- See that pen right there?

144
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,490
It's gonna knock it over.

145
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,371
- [Ellie] Soon.

146
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,870
Ah!

147
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,800
That means that the world is rotating.

148
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,101
(bell dings)

149
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:54,920
Yeah.
- What?

150
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,940
- [Jared] It did it.

151
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,600
- [Ellie] This is like what
we do to Jackson's rocks, huh?

152
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,210
- See how it's all bumpy,

153
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,963
now it's all smooth.

154
00:05:00,963 --> 00:05:01,796
- Yeah.

155
00:05:01,796 --> 00:05:04,670
- Look Jackson, this is a
real rock from outer space.

156
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,490
This is a meteorite and it landed on earth

157
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,640
in the year 1516.

158
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,504
- Ellie] That is crazy.

159
00:05:10,504 --> 00:05:12,150
- [Jared] That is almost 2,000 pounds.

160
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,050
- [Ellie] What if it landed at like,

161
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,472
I mean it has to land somewhere.

162
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,305
- Yeah,

163
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:17,422
it landed in China.

164
00:05:17,422 --> 00:05:18,687
- Giant ball.

165
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:20,688
- A giant rock, yeah.

166
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:22,637
- And fall the giant ball.

167
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:23,874
- Yeah, it fell out of the sky.

168
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,964
- It fell out of the sky.

169
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:28,710
You're so cute, you're so cute.

170
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,230
I have a feeling for
Christmas Jackson might want

171
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,420
a new marble run.

172
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,690
Holy crapola.

173
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,112
- I could build it.

174
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:38,861
(Ellie laughs)

175
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,694
- Matt could build it.

176
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,377
(Ellie laughing)

177
00:05:45,377 --> 00:05:46,770
They are so done.

178
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,420
Calvin's eating leftover popcorn, come on.

179
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,302
- I won again!

180
00:05:52,302 --> 00:05:56,050
- You will not believe what
Calvin and I found, come on.

181
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,920
(Ellie gasps)

182
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,753
Look at all of these.

183
00:05:57,753 --> 00:05:58,677
- [Ellie] What is it?

184
00:05:58,677 --> 00:05:59,607
- Shiny rocks.

185
00:05:59,607 --> 00:06:01,399
- Shiny rocks.
- Shiny rocks.

186
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,824
- Oh I want this kind of one.

187
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:03,657
- [Jared] You like this?

188
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:04,490
Look at this one.

189
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,050
- [Ellie] This is up Jackson
and Calvin's alley guys.

190
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,320
Those are beautiful.

191
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,830
- They're geodes, huh?

192
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,830
- [Ellie] There's a
place I think in Dugway

193
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,750
or somewhere that you can
go get your own geodes

194
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,600
and brake 'em.

195
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,458
- Oh yeah?

196
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,291
- [Ellie] We need to go do that.

197
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,569
- Yes we should.

198
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:21,069
(chill music)

199
00:06:28,027 --> 00:06:29,210
Everything that we have done so far

200
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,410
has led up to this point right here.

201
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,427
Jackson, what are we doing?

202
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:35,240
- We're going to Disney on Ice!

203
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,927
- [Jared] Yeah, are you so excited?

204
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:37,760
- Yeah.

205
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,593
- [Jared] Yeah, let's go.

206
00:06:38,593 --> 00:06:39,490
- Even my sword.

207
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:42,020
- [Jared] Whoa, so cool.

208
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,625
We're gonna see Mickey and Minnie

209
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,860
and all of our favorite Disney guys.

210
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,194
Should we go find our seats?

211
00:06:47,194 --> 00:06:48,027
- Yeah.

212
00:06:48,027 --> 00:06:48,860
- [Jared] Alright.

213
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:51,880
Look what I've got, a crown for the king.

214
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,060
And for the jester, 'cause he's asleep.

215
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,600
Are you so excited dude?

216
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,580
I'm so excited for you, this
is gonna be such a blast.

217
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,339
Are you ready to see this bud?

218
00:07:00,339 --> 00:07:01,280
Here we are.

219
00:07:02,356 --> 00:07:03,350
- [Jackson] The ice!

220
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,408
- [Jared] Do you see the ice?

221
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:05,241
- Yeah.

222
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,090
- [Jared] Is that so cool?

223
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:10,480
So fluffy, dude, look how
awesome these seats are.

224
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:12,832
Are you ready for this guys?

225
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
- Thank you Daddy.

226
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,890
- You're welcome.

227
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,560
Can I have a big bite like last time?

228
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,269
- All of it, bite it.

229
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:35,275
(lyrical Disney music)

230
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:38,537
Did you know that you used
to be scared of cotton candy?

231
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:39,370
(laughs)

232
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,930
You ate it and was like
scared of it and now

233
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,650
take a bite, you love it.

234
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,174
Are you ready?

235
00:07:48,174 --> 00:07:49,981
Calvin are you ready?

236
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:50,845
- Yep.

237
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,747
- Yep.

238
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:52,580
(laughs)

239
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,163
(lively music)

240
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:15,280
- Mickey, Goofy said scary.

241
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,330
- [Ellie] I don't know why he said scary.

242
00:08:18,534 --> 00:08:21,117
(lively music)

243
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:29,833
- Woo!

244
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,552
He's lifting her so high.

245
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:35,135
(lively music)

246
00:08:56,917 --> 00:08:59,167
(applause)

247
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:02,982
- Woo!

248
00:09:02,982 --> 00:09:03,920
(cheering)

249
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,780
- That was crazy.

250
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,140
They're having intermission

251
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,660
and Jackson was extremely intrigued.

252
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,375
Who are you intrigued by?

253
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:12,255
- Snow White.

254
00:09:12,255 --> 00:09:13,370
- Snow White.

255
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:15,680
Jackson really wants to see Snow White.

256
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,620
So when we get home, maybe tonight

257
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,460
or tomorrow morning,
we'll watch Snow White.

258
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:25,463
(playful guitar music)

259
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:39,730
(Jackson laughing)

260
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,330
The tiniest little bit?

261
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,359
What was your favorite part.

262
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,180
- The Elsa one.

263
00:09:58,202 --> 00:09:59,730
- [Ellie] The Elsa song?

264
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,990
Calvin, did you love it?

265
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:02,835
- Yeah.

266
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:04,935
- [Ellie] What song was your favorite one?

267
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,240
Elsa?

268
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,620
- Well and just like that,

269
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,190
two hours later, we are finally home

270
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:14,840
and the kids are zonked in bed.

271
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,270
Disney on Ice was so awesome.

272
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,640
And anything Disney does,
whether it's Disneyland,

273
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,490
Disney World, the cruise,
Disney on ice, it's magical.

274
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,360
The experience was so awesome,

275
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,941
everything that they did was fantastic.

276
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:29,800
Highly recommend, ten out of ten,

277
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,080
would go again.

278
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,730
Now, just like Ellie said,

279
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,830
we want to do these kind of dates

280
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,020
with Jackson and Calvin
before the baby comes,

281
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,020
whether it's Jackson and Calvin,

282
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,510
or just Jackson

283
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,550
or just Calvin.

284
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,270
Or even just Ellie by herself,

285
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,330
me by myself, us two
together doing these things,

286
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,340
getting ready for the baby to come.

287
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,170
It's kind of fun to take time individually

288
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,050
with the kids and make them feel special

289
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,350
and we love doing that.

290
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,610
And the best part about it is

291
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,326
while we're home right now,

292
00:10:57,326 --> 00:10:59,300
the adventure's not done yet.

293
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,620
We have the car ready,
we have the trailer ready

294
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,860
and our next adventure is
just around the corner.

295
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,730
So make sure you guys are subscribed,

296
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,830
because we are going to
do something very very fun

297
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,740
as a family to continue this date

298
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,090
that we're going on as a family.

299
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,820
But for now, we've got to get some rest

300
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,130
because we have a lot of stuff to do

301
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,170
before we go.

302
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,720
So with that, thank you
guys so much for watching.

303
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,520
I hope you had a wonderful day with us

304
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,990
as we spent the day with the family

305
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,120
doing some incredible stuff.

306
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,020
And we will see you guys next time,

307
00:11:30,020 --> 00:00:00,000
when we do more awesome
stuff, thanks guys, bye.
