1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:02,934
- He just bumped his lip.

2
00:00:02,934 --> 00:00:03,989
- It's bleeding.

3
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:05,053
- Is it bleeding?

4
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:07,352
Should we wipe it off or do
you just wanna go back down?

5
00:00:07,352 --> 00:00:08,417
- Go back down.

6
00:00:08,417 --> 00:00:09,646
- Do you wanna go back down and play?

7
00:00:09,646 --> 00:00:12,277
- It hurts right here.

8
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:14,649
See, it hurts right there.

9
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:15,982
- Can you smile?

10
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:18,828
It's okay.

11
00:00:18,828 --> 00:00:20,095
He doesn't mind when he's bleeding.

12
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:22,751
Well, let's just rinse your
mouth out real quick, okay bud?

13
00:00:22,751 --> 00:00:24,668
You just wanna go play?

14
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:33,591
(fun Christmas music)

15
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:39,613
Here, Caleb.

16
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:45,174
(screaming)

17
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:50,720
(laughing)

18
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:58,392
- [Kendra] So what are you guys up to?

19
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,461
- We have water balloons.

20
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,962
- [Kendra] You made water balloons?

21
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:05,290
- [Elise] And we're coming in
the bathtub to squish them.

22
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,723
- [Kendra] Here's the pile of
water balloons that they made

23
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:10,573
and Caleb, what are you doing?

24
00:01:10,573 --> 00:01:12,079
- [Caleb] I'm stomping on it.

25
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:12,912
- [Kendra] You're throwing them.

26
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:14,179
You're trying to get 'em to break?

27
00:01:14,179 --> 00:01:15,012
- Mhm.

28
00:01:15,012 --> 00:01:16,438
- [Kendra] Thanks for
trying to get 'em to break

29
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:19,729
in the bathtub, guys, that was nice of ya.

30
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,646
Okay, time to get ready for church.

31
00:01:23,604 --> 00:01:25,118
- It's Sunday?

32
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:27,377
- [Kendra] It is Sunday.

33
00:01:27,377 --> 00:01:28,397
Elise, get it out of your mouth.

34
00:01:28,397 --> 00:01:31,477
- It's Sunday, it's Sunday, it's Sunday.

35
00:01:31,477 --> 00:01:34,827
It's church, it's church, it's church.

36
00:01:34,827 --> 00:01:36,342
- Okay, let's go get ready for church.

37
00:01:36,342 --> 00:01:39,243
We bribed them that when
they got in their car seats,

38
00:01:39,243 --> 00:01:40,228
we would give them each

39
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,987
a piece of Hi-Chew during the drive.

40
00:01:41,987 --> 00:01:44,946
- It was very effective,
we're gonna need more Hi-Chew.

41
00:01:44,946 --> 00:01:46,419
- We're on our way to church

42
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:48,103
and we are running a little bit late

43
00:01:48,103 --> 00:01:50,580
but we are all clean, we are all fed.

44
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,734
We all brushed our teeth.

45
00:01:51,734 --> 00:01:53,252
We're dressed.

46
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:55,220
I'm counting it as a success anyway

47
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,599
but we were in a hurry as
we were getting ready to go

48
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,989
and I was the last one to get dressed

49
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:00,968
and so I put on my skirt

50
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:03,038
and then I grabbed the nearest shirt

51
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:04,391
and I was like eh, this will work

52
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,189
and it was the shirt that I wore yesterday

53
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,253
to the Christmas concert

54
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:09,549
and so immediately it runs
through my brain like,

55
00:02:09,549 --> 00:02:11,143
okay, it's not really dirty.

56
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:13,397
I only wore it for the
Christmas concert yesterday

57
00:02:13,397 --> 00:02:15,491
but will anybody see me yesterday,

58
00:02:15,491 --> 00:02:16,999
today that saw me yesterday?

59
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,921
And I was like no, I'm
good and I put it on

60
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,230
and then I was like, wait a minute.

61
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,684
I daily vlog, everybody's gonna see.

62
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:24,724
The shirt was on the video yesterday.

63
00:02:24,724 --> 00:02:27,847
I have to wear a new shirt so
thanks for keeping me honest.

64
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:29,924
Issac, do you wanna hang one up?

65
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:32,916
'Cause we're gonna take turns.

66
00:02:32,916 --> 00:02:35,749
This one says Our First Christmas.

67
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,829
- [Caleb] Mom, is it my turn?

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,159
- Every year growing up, my
mom and dad got each of us kids

69
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:45,063
a special ornament and
so my name and the date,

70
00:02:45,063 --> 00:02:46,454
the year that I was given it

71
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:48,138
is on the back of all of our ornaments

72
00:02:48,138 --> 00:02:48,971
and it's really special

73
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,416
just because I have a specific memory

74
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,416
attached to all of them.

75
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:58,037
- This little girl knew she
was missing out on the fun.

76
00:02:58,037 --> 00:03:00,616
She did not wanna go to bed.

77
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:02,533
We having fun out here?

78
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:05,451
- This ornament is super special to me.

79
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:09,368
It is from my grandparents'
tree and I love it.

80
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,656
They both passed away in 2010

81
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:14,783
and so it's special to have something

82
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:16,950
from their Christmas tree.

83
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:24,704
This one is from my grandmother.

84
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,634
She got it when I was born
and it says my birthday

85
00:03:27,634 --> 00:03:31,634
and how much I weighed
and what time I was born.

86
00:03:33,422 --> 00:03:36,756
This one my sister got for me
when she went to Jerusalem.

87
00:03:36,756 --> 00:03:39,246
These are some special ornaments
that we made last year.

88
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:40,595
Let's see, I think I wrote on 'em.

89
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,428
Isaac.

90
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:45,590
Elise.

91
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:51,495
- There.
- Right there?

92
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:54,523
That's a great spot for it.

93
00:03:54,523 --> 00:03:57,917
♫ Like a diamond in the sky

94
00:03:57,917 --> 00:04:02,415
♫ Twinkle twinkle little star

95
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:06,415
- [Kendra] Uh oh, this
looks a little dangerous.

96
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,136
- Good job.

97
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:15,412
Fail.

98
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:18,497
- [Kendra] Okay, ready?

99
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:20,081
Put it on together.

100
00:04:21,765 --> 00:04:22,598
- There we go.

101
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:24,336
- [Kendra] Yay.

102
00:04:24,336 --> 00:04:26,828
♫ We wish you a merry Christmas

103
00:04:26,828 --> 00:04:29,472
♫ We wish you a merry Christmas

104
00:04:29,472 --> 00:04:33,639
♫ We wish you a merry
Christmas and a happy new year

105
00:04:34,884 --> 00:04:37,301
♫ Noel, Noel

106
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:42,465
♫ Noel, Noel

107
00:04:46,426 --> 00:00:00,000
♫ Born is the King of Israel
