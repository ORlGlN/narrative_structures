1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:02,294
- Need to be strong.

2
00:00:03,241 --> 00:00:07,246
- I just want the floor to
be safe for me to explore

3
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:08,759
and I spit up.

4
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,930
That's all.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,597
(kids giggling)

6
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,188
- [Jeremy] Good job.

7
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,834
- I don't wanna work hard.

8
00:00:20,834 --> 00:00:23,408
- [Jeremy] You don't
wanna work hard, why not?

9
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:25,649
- Because I'm a little girl.

10
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:26,750
- [Jeremy] You're a little girl.

11
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:27,635
- Yeah.

12
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:28,681
- I think you can work hard.

13
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,628
We're gonna teach you
how to work hard, okay?

14
00:00:30,628 --> 00:00:32,134
So this morning some of our kids

15
00:00:32,134 --> 00:00:33,842
were complaining about doing chores

16
00:00:33,842 --> 00:00:36,108
or some of the things we ask them to do.

17
00:00:36,108 --> 00:00:38,458
And I had recently watched
a motivational video

18
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:41,045
talking about what leads to success.

19
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:45,281
And they were saying that it
takes discipline and hard work.

20
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:49,500
Doing the things that you may
not love to do consistently

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,835
is what can make you great.

22
00:00:50,835 --> 00:00:53,201
And so I think sometimes as
kids it's hard to understand

23
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,863
how practicing the piano
or doing daily chores

24
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:57,414
is gonna make a difference.

25
00:00:57,414 --> 00:00:58,973
But it does.

26
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:00,183
Having that attitude

27
00:01:00,183 --> 00:01:02,716
of being able to do things you don't love

28
00:01:02,716 --> 00:01:05,081
makes all the difference in the world

29
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,080
to some day be your best self.

30
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,297
(kids laughing)

31
00:01:10,297 --> 00:01:11,380
She likes it.

32
00:01:16,596 --> 00:01:19,263
(Janae babbles)

33
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:23,414
There she goes.

34
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:26,966
- [Isaac] What is this?

35
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:28,272
- [Jeremy] I want to eat it.

36
00:01:28,272 --> 00:01:29,944
You gonna try to lead her to your bedroom?

37
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:30,777
- Yeah.

38
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,777
(Janae babbles)

39
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:36,777
- [Jeremy] She's coming.

40
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:43,140
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,473
Thanks for helping you guys.

42
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:55,963
(Laura exclaims)

43
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:57,463
- More vegetables.

44
00:01:58,315 --> 00:02:00,658
We have too many vegetables.

45
00:02:00,658 --> 00:02:02,566
- [Jeremy] Mom does like vegetables.

46
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:04,154
- [Isaac] That's not good.

47
00:02:04,154 --> 00:02:05,216
- [Jeremy] It's really good.

48
00:02:05,216 --> 00:02:06,725
That means we get to eat healthy.

49
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,558
- Yeah.

50
00:02:07,558 --> 00:02:10,116
- And that's what we need to be strong.

51
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,612
- [Jeremy] Are you feeling hungry?

52
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:12,445
- Yeah,

53
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:13,361
I want a banana.

54
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,944
- [Jeremy] You want to eat one?

55
00:02:14,944 --> 00:02:16,305
- That's why I wanted it open.

56
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:17,770
- [Jeremy] You want it
open so you can eat it?

57
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:18,603
- Yeah.

58
00:02:18,603 --> 00:02:19,697
- So one of our kids' favorite snacks

59
00:02:19,697 --> 00:02:21,685
is bananas with sprinkles.

60
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:23,010
They have requested it.

61
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,687
And that sounds like fun.

62
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,270
(bright music)

63
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,374
Banana and sprinkles.

64
00:02:42,374 --> 00:02:44,711
I made yours into a smiley face.

65
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:46,058
- Umm.

66
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:48,725
- You made mine into a football.

67
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:51,053
- I'm so proud of Elise.

68
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:52,643
She has just discovered that she can read

69
00:02:52,643 --> 00:02:54,909
the verses in the Bible,
the King James version.

70
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:55,802
Listen to this.

71
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:58,978
- Let your light so shine before men

72
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:03,145
that they may see your good
works and glorify your father

73
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,551
which is in heaven.

74
00:03:07,595 --> 00:03:08,562
- [Jeremy] Good job big girl.

75
00:03:08,562 --> 00:03:09,760
- I'm so proud of you.

76
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,174
- [Jeremy] You're reading so well.

77
00:03:11,174 --> 00:03:13,761
- [Kendra] So the boys have
set up a sports station.

78
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,511
(dramatic music)

79
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:21,178
- I'm gonna teach him
about all the stisticks.

80
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,078
- [Kendra] That's a hard word to say.

81
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:23,346
- Statistics.

82
00:03:23,346 --> 00:03:25,364
And then.
- Statistics.

83
00:03:25,364 --> 00:03:27,902
- And then RDFs.
- Staticsticks.

84
00:03:27,902 --> 00:03:29,215
- [Kendra] Statistics.

85
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:34,056
- I'm having him write down
what the abbreviation is

86
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,266
and dash, and then write
down what it means.

87
00:03:36,266 --> 00:03:38,605
But like for a completion percentage,

88
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:41,403
I just had him write down catch rate,

89
00:03:41,403 --> 00:03:43,586
like just how often people catch it.

90
00:03:43,586 --> 00:03:45,412
- I am not a sports person, really.

91
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:48,850
I probably can't name a
single player of anything.

92
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,493
And so I don't really understand
Isaac's passion for it.

93
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:54,611
But I love that he's
passionate about something.

94
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:56,478
And I love that he digs deep into it.

95
00:03:56,478 --> 00:03:59,271
And that's cool and I
wanna learn more about it

96
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,616
so I can support him in that.

97
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:01,449
It's interesting with kids.

98
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,306
Sometimes they get into stuff

99
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,875
that you don't really know much about

100
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,517
or maybe care a lot about.

101
00:04:06,517 --> 00:04:10,439
But that's a great opportunity
for me to show my love

102
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,812
and dig deeper into it.

103
00:04:11,812 --> 00:04:14,080
So something I always want
to remember about baby Janae

104
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,777
is that she has this one long hair.

105
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:18,766
- [Jeremy] The Alfalfa hair.

106
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:21,878
- And it looks like this
little tiny ponytail.

107
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,029
And sometimes it sticks up

108
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,406
and sometimes it sticks out more

109
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:25,732
and sometimes it blends in.

110
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,567
But she's gonna grow up and
she's gonna have even hair.

111
00:04:28,567 --> 00:04:30,566
And I'm gonna forget
that when she was little,

112
00:04:30,566 --> 00:04:32,601
she had this one long hair.

113
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:34,040
It's been there since
she was a brand new baby.

114
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,245
- [Jeremy] Her comb over.

115
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:36,418
- It's nap time.

116
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:38,121
I'm gonna go put her down.

117
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:39,805
You look nice.

118
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:40,638
- Thanks.

119
00:04:40,638 --> 00:04:42,200
- [Kendra] Did you do your hair?

120
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,693
- Yeah, it's made out of a lot of bows

121
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:48,108
and me and Elise wanted to do a bow party.

122
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:49,905
- [Kendra] Oh, so you put
some bows in your hair.

123
00:04:49,905 --> 00:04:51,133
Well they look really nice.

124
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,013
- How is it so hard?

125
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:54,026
- [Kendra] They're frozen rolls.

126
00:04:54,026 --> 00:04:55,828
We're gonna bake 'em.

127
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,148
- But why are they hard
when they're frozen?

128
00:04:58,148 --> 00:04:59,739
- [Kendra] 'Cause that's
what frozen things are,

129
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:00,572
they're hard.

130
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:02,481
So dinner tonight is the
meal that Laura and I made

131
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:04,188
at freezer club last week.

132
00:05:04,188 --> 00:05:05,868
And it is delicious.

133
00:05:05,868 --> 00:05:07,813
It's the chicken pesto casserole.

134
00:05:07,813 --> 00:05:10,206
With our favorite salad and frozen rolls.

135
00:05:10,206 --> 00:05:11,710
- [Jeremy] Did you make this?

136
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:13,064
- Yep.

137
00:05:13,064 --> 00:05:14,201
- [Jeremy] Good job ma'am.

138
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,429
- Me and Mommy did.

139
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:17,123
- [Kendra] Was it easy or hard to make it?

140
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:18,297
- Hard.

141
00:05:18,297 --> 00:05:20,088
- [Kendra] Yeah, well you did a good job.

142
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,296
- [Jeremy] Ooo, you didn't
get a big enough bite.

143
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,907
- [Kendra] (snickers) Daddy's joking.

144
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,157
Hi, did you want some food?

145
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,723
You guys notice that Janae
is moving around a lot more?

146
00:05:30,723 --> 00:05:31,583
- Yeah.

147
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,048
- Yeah, she's really starting to crawl.

148
00:05:33,048 --> 00:05:34,596
Hey, have you guys also noticed

149
00:05:34,596 --> 00:05:36,830
when Janae gets stuff,
does she like to touch it?

150
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,663
- Yeah.

151
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,589
- And then what does she do with it?

152
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:39,693
- Put it in her mouth.

153
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:41,131
- She puts it straight in her mouth.

154
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:42,920
That's how babies discover and learn

155
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,976
and explore about things,

156
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:45,835
but it can also be dangerous.

157
00:05:45,835 --> 00:05:47,711
So it's really important,
it's all of our jobs

158
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,212
to keep our house safe for Janae.

159
00:05:50,212 --> 00:05:52,058
So I went around the house
and I picked up things

160
00:05:52,058 --> 00:05:53,578
that were on the floor.

161
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:55,735
So we're gonna take turns
grabbing something outta here

162
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,913
and saying why it is or is not safe.

163
00:05:58,913 --> 00:06:01,761
Alright Laura, grab something out.

164
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:03,392
So what is that Ms. Laura?

165
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:04,418
- Scissors.

166
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:05,980
- [Kendra] Are those safe for babies?

167
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,671
No, so where do we need to keep scissors?

168
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:10,295
- In the pencil drawer.

169
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:11,473
- In the drawer.

170
00:06:11,473 --> 00:06:13,330
Next up, Isaac.

171
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,733
That is a wet diaper.

172
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,584
- I didn't know that.

173
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:19,992
- Why is that safe or not safe?

174
00:06:19,992 --> 00:06:22,400
- Because it has germs.

175
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,371
And she could bite on it and
get bad things in her mouth.

176
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,562
- Would you like to suck on this?

177
00:06:27,562 --> 00:06:28,569
- No!

178
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:30,245
(kids laughing)

179
00:06:30,245 --> 00:06:32,389
- Why can't she play with this?

180
00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:35,634
- Because it might have
germs on it from blood.

181
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,417
- Yeah, that's disgusting.

182
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:39,167
They are dirty socks.

183
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,927
Ms. Laura, show us yours.

184
00:06:42,927 --> 00:06:46,580
- It could get germs on
her and make her choke.

185
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,643
- Do you wanna suck on that?

186
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,858
Dude, that would cut you.

187
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,367
Metal things with sharp edges

188
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,243
should definitely be away from our baby.

189
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,834
She loves the sound of plastic.

190
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,107
Why can't she play with this.

191
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:56,201
- Because she can breathe inside it

192
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:58,015
and she won't be able to breathe.

193
00:06:58,015 --> 00:06:59,081
- Suffocate.

194
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,786
It's called suffocation and
we don't like suffocation.

195
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:02,809
How about this one?

196
00:07:02,809 --> 00:07:03,642
- [Elise] She can.

197
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:04,718
- This is one of her toys.

198
00:07:04,718 --> 00:07:06,178
And they make baby toys safe.

199
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,960
Do you see, does this
have any sharp edges?

200
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,438
- [Kids] No.

201
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:10,999
- [Jeremy] Does anything come off?

202
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:12,150
Does the head pop off?

203
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,072
- Nope.

204
00:07:13,072 --> 00:07:15,029
So this is a toy that she can play with.

205
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,927
There you go Janae.

206
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:17,919
All of us have shoes all over the house.

207
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,562
Can Janae suck on our shoes?

208
00:07:19,562 --> 00:07:21,903
- No, there's a ton of
germs from the ground

209
00:07:21,903 --> 00:07:22,817
and other people's.

210
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:26,301
- And if you're at public places

211
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:29,051
at those bathrooms, and lick 'em.

212
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:31,776
- Yeah, that would be disgusting.

213
00:07:31,776 --> 00:07:34,893
What I need is a bunch
of safety inspectors

214
00:07:34,893 --> 00:07:36,182
who are on my team

215
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:37,892
to help make sure at all times

216
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:40,256
that our floor is safe for our baby.

217
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:43,687
- I just want the floor to
be safe for me to explore

218
00:07:43,687 --> 00:07:44,854
and I spit up.

219
00:07:45,986 --> 00:07:46,846
That's all.

220
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:49,513
(kids laughing)

221
00:07:51,774 --> 00:07:53,148
- [Laura] Goodnight.

222
00:07:53,148 --> 00:07:54,148
J House out.

223
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,191
(Laura laughs)
(bright music)

224
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,718
(kids laughing)

225
00:08:00,718 --> 00:08:02,879
- She got the biggest one.

226
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,084
- [Elise] Good job Isaac.

227
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,482
- J House store, right here.

228
00:08:07,482 --> 00:00:00,000
Come to the J House store, it's
the best store in the world!
