all of our kids are healthy,

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,383
and I'm happy to be able
to help these families

21
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:57,850
that are going through this tough time

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,100
during this holiday season.

23
00:01:03,586 --> 00:01:05,169
Alright here we go.

24
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:07,580
- [Jeremy] Kendra we need a picture of you

25
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,224

the vlog at the same time.

26
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,307
- I'm holding everything!

27
00:01:15,772 --> 00:01:18,603
- That's some advanced-level
vlogging right there.

28
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:22,770
She's got her hands full of
this and she's trying to vlog.

29
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,916
So here's the kitchen, they
have it set up really neat,

30
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:30,083
there's four identical
kitchens here that are set up,

31
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:32,635
and I really wanna come here some night

32
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,364
with four friends and play Chopped.

33
00:01:35,364 --> 00:01:36,909
- So we're making Hawaiian haystacks,

34
00:01:36,909 --> 00:01:39,106

35
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,847

37
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:43,726
- Brownies.

38
00:01:43,726 --> 00:01:45,306
- [Kendra] Brownies, the favorite part,

39
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,664
we're all hard at work.

40
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:51,357
Liesi's holding while Isaac
stirs, and then we switch.

41
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:54,607
K Isaac you hold it and let Liesi stir.

42
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,430
What'cha doin' Liesi?

43
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,632
- I'm cutting.

44
00:01:58,632 --> 00:02:00,190
- [Kendra] What is it that you're cutting?

45
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,243
- I don't know.

46
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:04,300
- [Kendra] Oh it's green
onions is what it's called.

47
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,517
It's one of our toppings today.

48
00:02:06,517 --> 00:02:09,934
So Elise has it going strong right there.

49
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:15,042
With a real knife, you bein' careful?

50
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:15,875
- Yes.

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,387
- [Kendra] Good job.

52
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:32,153
And now cleanup duty.

53
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,647
- We have a little assembly line goin'.

54
00:02:34,647 --> 00:02:38,269
- [Kendra] Loading the dishwashers.

55
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:40,197
Cleaning up, bud?

56
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:42,364
- This is the spray spray.

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,909
- That's the spray spray,
k wipe the table for me.

58
00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:47,510
Show me how you wipe the table.

59
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,677
No no no not the salt, no.

60
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,301
Well that was a really good
experience, we really liked it.

61
00:02:55,301 --> 00:02:57,942
- Yeah the thing I loved
about it the most was

62
00:02:57,942 --> 00:02:59,974
actually getting to talk to the families

63
00:02:59,974 --> 00:03:03,215
who are having a family member
in the hospital right now,

64
00:03:03,215 --> 00:03:06,336
we met this one couple, they
have a three-year-old girl

65
00:03:06,336 --> 00:03:09,139
and a five-month-old baby
boy, and the five-month-old

66
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:11,442
just went through his
second open heart surgery,

67
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:14,465
he's been in the hospital
a month for this last time.

68
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:16,509
They live two hours from the hospital,

69
00:03:16,509 --> 00:03:17,939
they're hoping that their little boy

70
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,208
is able to come home
for Christmas tomorrow,

71
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:22,364
and they were so kind, like
they were showing pictures

72
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:25,303
to Isaac, and Elise and
Caleb of their baby boy,

73
00:03:25,303 --> 00:03:29,917
and telling them about the
surgery and what it's been like

74
00:03:29,917 --> 00:03:31,375
and I really hope that for our kids

75
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:33,759
that as we go and do these
things that they're able to

76
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,611
understand that there are people out there

77
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:37,620
going through a hard time,
and that there's things

78
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,505
that we can do to try to
help lift their burden

79
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:42,005
in some small way.

80
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,156
- I am totally on top of things

81
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:48,103
and finished my Christmas shopping about,

82
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:50,673
at least 30 minutes
ago, which is very nice.

83
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:54,628
So now we are headed to
Brent and Michelle's house

84
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:57,445
for a Christmas Eve dinner spectacular.

85
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,391
So we have a great feast over here.

86
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:02,141
Ham, cheesy potatoes.

87
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,209
- So one of the things that Brent does is

88
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,505
he makes these Italian sodas with dinner,

89
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:15,289
he's gonna surprise me
with some awesome flavor.

90
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,622
Woah, it's good.

91
00:04:18,661 --> 00:04:19,744
- Yeah it is.

92
00:04:21,235 --> 00:04:25,318
- I'm gonna go with,
goodness, I don't even know.

93
00:04:26,422 --> 00:04:28,303
- It's cinnamon vanilla coconut.

94
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,136
- Woah.

95
00:04:30,157 --> 00:04:31,377
- [Kendra] Can I try it?

96
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:34,877
- Yeah, cinnamon vanilla coconut, festive.

97
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:37,851
- Woah.

98
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:40,610
What are you guys watching?

99
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,443
- Santa is in London,
England in five seconds.

100
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:48,265
- [Kendra] Is this the Santa tracker?

101
00:04:48,265 --> 00:04:49,639
- Yeah.

102
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,722
- [Brent] The virgin's name was Mary,

103
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,915
and Mary was a little
bit scared of the angel.

104
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:59,923
- [Jeremy] And then
Joseph randomly showed up.

105
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,984
- [Brent] And the angel said

106
00:05:01,984 --> 00:05:05,817
'blessed art thou among
women, fear not Mary.'

107
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,489
And it came to pass in those days

108
00:05:10,489 --> 00:05:14,239
there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus.

109
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,799
- [Jeremy] He ran away, he ditched her.

110
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,208
Oh there he is, fakie.

111
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,765
Stay with Mary.

112
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:25,152
- [Brent] To be taxed with
Mary, his espoused wife,

113
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:27,069
being great with child.

114
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,338
And Mary kicked the donkey.

115
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:36,377
(adults laughing)

116
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:39,845
And Joseph kicked the donkey.

117
00:05:39,845 --> 00:05:43,095
(singing Silent Night)

118
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:58,903
- We just finished
watching the world record

119
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:02,294
largest Nativity video from YouTube again.

120
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:05,019
It's amazing, it's really good.

121
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:06,317
Anyway we're eating our dessert,

122
00:06:06,317 --> 00:06:09,059
Michelle made apple crisp
and this cream cheese pie

123
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:13,584
with strawberry topping on it,
what'd you think Ms. Elise?

124
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:14,501
- MMMMMMMM.

125
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:20,941
- 'Twas the Night Before
Christmas, by Clement C. Moore.

126
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:25,615
Do you guys wanna see when
this one was published?

127
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:28,791
In 1822 a New York clergyman--

128
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,707
- That's my age!

129
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:32,627
- Oh you're a little
bit younger than that.

130
00:06:32,627 --> 00:06:35,358
- [Jeremy] I think he
heard the number 'two.'

131
00:06:35,358 --> 00:06:40,208
'Twas the night before
Christmas, is that tonight?

132
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,327
'Twas the night before Christmas
when all through the house

133
00:06:43,327 --> 00:06:47,472
not a creature was
stirring, not even a mouse.

134
00:06:47,472 --> 00:06:49,306
And as you guys are
falling asleep tonight,

135
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:50,866
I want you to think about Jesus

136
00:06:50,866 --> 00:06:53,258
and how grateful you are for Jesus, okay?

137
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:57,409
- [Isaac] I will dream about
Mary and Joseph and Jesus.

138
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,365
- That would be a fun dream.

139
00:06:59,365 --> 00:07:00,615
Alright, ready?

140
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,839
(singing Joy to the World)

141
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:24,048
- [All] Merry Christmas!

142
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,048
- J House out, ho ho ho.

143
00:07:26,933 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kids] J House out, ho ho ho.
