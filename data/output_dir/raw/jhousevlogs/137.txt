1
00:00:00,306 --> 00:00:02,468
- You know Harry at Hogwarts?

2
00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:03,709
He talks in British.

3
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:05,399
(door stop vibrates)

4
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:06,932
- [Kendra] Hi.

5
00:00:06,932 --> 00:00:07,926
Say goodbye.

6
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,259
Parade of Homes!

7
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:11,067
- What? What?

8
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,174
- [Kendra] What did you guys find?

9
00:00:13,174 --> 00:00:14,522
- Shut the door, Elise!

10
00:00:14,522 --> 00:00:15,355
- [Kendra] Arms up!

11
00:00:15,355 --> 00:00:17,605
(giggling)

12
00:00:18,856 --> 00:00:21,864
- [Jeremy] What are these on your arm?

13
00:00:21,864 --> 00:00:23,784
- This is my energy.

14
00:00:23,784 --> 00:00:24,909
- [Jeremy] That's your energy?

15
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:28,409
- Yes! If I need princesses, I just, this.

16
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:31,736
- [Jeremy] Cool.

17
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:36,460
- This is my family.

18
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,979
This is my pet.

19
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:39,914
This is my brother.

20
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,306
This is my dad.

21
00:00:41,306 --> 00:00:42,789
This is my mom.

22
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:43,998
- [Jeremy] So, Caleb,
you're doing something

23
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:45,468
a little different today, right?

24
00:00:45,468 --> 00:00:46,693
- British accent.

25
00:00:46,693 --> 00:00:48,261
- [Jeremy] You're talking
with a British accent?

26
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:49,421
Let's hear it.

27
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:50,254
- Hello.

28
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,434
- [Jeremy] Was that with a British accent?

29
00:00:52,434 --> 00:00:53,327
- Uh-huh.

30
00:00:53,327 --> 00:00:55,129
- [Jeremy] So, why are you wanting

31
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:56,341
to practice using a British accent?

32
00:00:56,341 --> 00:00:58,721
- You know Harry at Hogwarts?

33
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:00,916
- [Jeremy] Oh, Harry Potter? Yeah.

34
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,517
- He talks in British.

35
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:04,172
- [Jeremy] So you're going
to try to be like Harry?

36
00:01:04,172 --> 00:01:05,004
- Uh-huh

37
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:05,925
- [Jeremy] Is this for Halloween?

38
00:01:05,925 --> 00:01:07,037
Are you going to be Harry Potter?

39
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:09,826
Can we hear the Pledge of
Allegiance in a British accent?

40
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:12,272
- I pledge allegiance to the flag

41
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,997
of the United States of America.

42
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:15,925
- [Jeremy] Well, good luck working

43
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,152
on your British accent.

44
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,352
- Yes.

45
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:19,491
- [Jeremy] Where you going?

46
00:01:19,491 --> 00:01:21,761
- I'm going to Nolan's house for school.

47
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:24,325
I don't know what I'm
gonna learn about today.

48
00:01:24,325 --> 00:01:25,581
- [Jeremy] And the other kids are going

49
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:27,467
to their homeschool enrichment program

50
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:29,510
that happens one day a week.

51
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,613
- I'm excited!

52
00:01:30,613 --> 00:01:33,015
(lively rhythmic music)

53
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,485
- So all the other kids are gone

54
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:36,487
at either school or their preschool.

55
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:37,620
(baby coos)

56
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,720
And we've been having so
much fun with Miss Janae.

57
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,606
Remember when we only had one kid?

58
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:42,839
- [Kendra] Yeah.

59
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:44,143
That was a thing.

60
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:45,310
So we're just starting to do some

61
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,649
baby sign language with Janae.

62
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,426
- [Jeremy] I think she's
signing milk sometimes.

63
00:01:50,426 --> 00:01:52,061
- Yeah. I think she is, too.

64
00:01:52,061 --> 00:01:55,819
So, we usually start with milk and more.

65
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:56,748
More.

66
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:57,938
(baby squeals)

67
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,290
More.

68
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,451
More.

69
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:02,396
Are you all done?

70
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:04,044
All done.

71
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:05,430
All done.

72
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,824
- [Jeremy] How was preschool?

73
00:02:06,824 --> 00:02:07,750
- Good!

74
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,345
I learned about leaves!

75
00:02:10,345 --> 00:02:11,681
- [Jeremy] Leaves?

76
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:12,642
- Hi, Nae-Nae!

77
00:02:12,642 --> 00:02:13,915
Hi!

78
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:14,970
- [Kendra] Come on, Laura!

79
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,301
We have a little date.

80
00:02:16,301 --> 00:02:17,613
- Him and you.

81
00:02:17,613 --> 00:02:19,383
- [Kendra] Oh. Him and me.

82
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:20,216
- Yup.

83
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,850
- I made an L with my crackers.

84
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,312
- [Kendra] You made an
L with your crackers?

85
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:26,743
You're getting really
great with the letter L.

86
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:29,410
So, Laura, an L looks like this.

87
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:32,135
Straight, over.

88
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:33,302
Can you do it?

89
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:35,976
Good job.

90
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:39,393
(tinny children's music)

91
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:46,825
(vibration)

92
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:50,866
(vibration)

93
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,278
(vibration)

94
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:54,624
- [Kendra] Hi.

95
00:02:54,624 --> 00:02:56,649
(Kendra laughs)

96
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:57,899
Did you see me?

97
00:02:58,756 --> 00:03:01,839
(upbeat dance music)

98
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:14,598
- [Jeremy] Alright. There you go.

99
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:23,393
(children talking quietly)

100
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:26,393
(slower guitar music)

101
00:03:26,393 --> 00:03:27,850
♫ Happy all the time

102
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,207
♫ Since Jesus came in

103
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:30,944
♫ And blessed my heart from sin

104
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,097
♫ I'm inright, outright,
upright, downright

105
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,866
♫ Happy all the time.

106
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:36,427
♫ I'm inright, outright,
upright, downright

107
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:37,978
♫ Happy all the time.

108
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,744
♫ I'm inright, outright,
upright, downright

109
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:41,321
♫ Happy all the time.

110
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,626
- [Kendra] Look what
came in the mail today.

111
00:03:43,626 --> 00:03:45,160
- So, our current vlogging camera

112
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,594
has been having some problems

113
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,226
and so we just got a new one.

114
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:50,345
This is only our fourth camera

115
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:52,129
in the three years of vlogging.

116
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:53,561
And these cameras go through a lot.

117
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:54,394
They get dropped.

118
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:55,838
The get gnawed on by children.

119
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:57,371
We're excited to have another new one.

120
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,506
- Here it is.

121
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,954
Say goodbye.

122
00:03:59,954 --> 00:04:01,538
Goodby little camera!

123
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:02,984
- [Jeremy] We'll probably
still use it occasionally

124
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:05,104
when we're both two places at one time.

125
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,257
- Probably.

126
00:04:06,257 --> 00:04:07,593
This afternoon Elise and Caleb and I

127
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:08,986
are going to the Parade of Homes.

128
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:09,857
I'm really excited!

129
00:04:09,857 --> 00:04:11,065
I love the Parade of Homes!

130
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:12,185
I just love touring homes.

131
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:13,632
I just think it's really exciting.

132
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,231
I know that someday we'll move and

133
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,689
be moving into another house and so

134
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,036
I love to get ideas of the things

135
00:04:18,036 --> 00:04:19,371
I'm interested in and the things that

136
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:20,295
I don't love.

137
00:04:20,295 --> 00:04:22,172
In Kansas City they do a Parade of Homes

138
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:23,433
in the spring and another one in the fall

139
00:04:23,433 --> 00:04:25,481
and it's free and you can
just go tour the homes.

140
00:04:25,481 --> 00:04:26,314
So, we're going!

141
00:04:26,314 --> 00:04:27,147
Let's check out this house.

142
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:30,730
(lively double bass music)

143
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:35,206
- I've never seen a
fireplace without a mantel.

144
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:36,118
- [Child] Wow.

145
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:37,646
- [Kendra] Well, that's
a beautiful kitchen.

146
00:04:37,646 --> 00:04:39,217
One of the things I dream about having

147
00:04:39,217 --> 00:04:41,066
in a next house for us is a half bath.

148
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:43,125
Right now any guests just have to go

149
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,193
to the kids' bathroom,
which is totally fine,

150
00:04:45,193 --> 00:04:46,918
but it's really hard to keep that clean

151
00:04:46,918 --> 00:04:48,619
and, you know, guest ready.

152
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,848
So a nice, simple half bath.

153
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:51,925
Now we're headed upstairs.

154
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:53,566
- [Elise] I love the floor.

155
00:04:53,566 --> 00:04:55,800
- [Kendra] You like the carpet?

156
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,017
- I want this room.

157
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,061
- [Kendra] You like this room?

158
00:04:58,061 --> 00:04:58,959
How's the closet, Caleb?

159
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,735
- Here's more for practice bars.

160
00:05:00,735 --> 00:05:03,275
- [Kendra] No, those
are not for gymnastics.

161
00:05:03,275 --> 00:05:04,502
The master room's in here.

162
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,035
- [Child] It might be a guest room.

163
00:05:07,035 --> 00:05:08,746
- Look, this is, like, a bathtub.

164
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,789
- [Kendra] Ohhh. It's a nice bathroom.

165
00:05:10,789 --> 00:05:13,001
- Hey! A Jack and Jill bathroom.

166
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:13,834
- [Kendra] Yeah.

167
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:16,042
Whoa! This is a huge closet!

168
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:17,680
And it goes into the laundry room

169
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,861
and then it goes back around.

170
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,483
- Yeah! It's like a whole circle.

171
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:22,503
- [Kendra] Think this would be your room?

172
00:05:22,503 --> 00:05:23,455
- [Caleb] Yeah.

173
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,981
- I actually think I want this one.

174
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,036
- [Kendra] You like this room better?

175
00:05:26,036 --> 00:05:29,016
Oh! Look how cute that is.

176
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,410
- [Caleb] Hi! It's like a playhouse!

177
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,848
(giggles)

178
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:34,419
It even has air conditioning.

179
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:35,311
- [Kendra] Does it?

180
00:05:35,311 --> 00:05:37,513
- Yeah, come on. Look!

181
00:05:37,513 --> 00:05:38,837
- [Kendra] Nice.

182
00:05:38,837 --> 00:05:40,597
There you go.

183
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:41,430
There's a light.

184
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,176
I think we could live in this one.

185
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,282
- We could sleep in here.

186
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:45,636
- [Kendra] So that house right there

187
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,186
is another Parade of Homes.

188
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:48,648
Let's go!

189
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,648
(upbeat jazz music)

190
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:56,930
(delighted giggles)

191
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,855
It's huge!

192
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:59,938
So, this is a walk-in pantry.

193
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:02,496
The floors are beautiful.

194
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,242
You guys going to explore upstairs first?

195
00:06:04,242 --> 00:06:06,013
- [Child] Yes!

196
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:08,544
- Now, this is beautiful!

197
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:10,302
- [Kendra] You think this is beautiful?

198
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,753
- The closets are big.

199
00:06:11,753 --> 00:06:15,060
- And then it comes into
another beautiful room.

200
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,537
- [Kendra] It's a Jack and Jill bathroom.

201
00:06:16,537 --> 00:06:19,870
(upbeat keyboard music)

202
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:27,286
- Look. And then lookie, lookie here.

203
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:28,536
- [Kendra] Wow!

204
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:33,279
This bathroom is big enough
for a legit dance party.

205
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,195
(Kendra laughs)

206
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,014
Almost. You guys are getting close.

207
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:37,245
Let's see the master closet.

208
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:38,378
- [Caleb] What?

209
00:06:38,378 --> 00:06:39,461
- What? What?

210
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,933
(giggles)

211
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,782
- [Kendra] It keeps going?

212
00:06:44,782 --> 00:06:46,083
It keeps going?

213
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:47,799
- I'm king of the world!

214
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,966
- [Kendra] This is where
the king of the world sits?

215
00:06:48,966 --> 00:06:49,945
- In the closet.

216
00:06:49,945 --> 00:06:51,066
- [Kendra] In the closet?

217
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,558
Well, this is an absolutely
beautiful master bedroom.

218
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:54,808
Check this out.

219
00:06:57,539 --> 00:06:59,677
Did you guys realize you look alike today?

220
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:00,623
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

221
00:07:00,623 --> 00:07:01,456
We purposely did that!

222
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:03,603
- [Kendra] Oh, you guy tried to match?

223
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:04,436
Matching.

224
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:07,230
You know you're an adult or a mom

225
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,880
when you look at new houses
and you're most excited

226
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,111
about the closet space.

227
00:07:10,111 --> 00:07:11,493
You're like, this would be awesome!

228
00:07:11,493 --> 00:07:13,797
I could store so much stuff in here!

229
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,045
Should we check this one out?

230
00:07:15,045 --> 00:07:16,538
- [Child] Yup.

231
00:07:16,538 --> 00:07:18,752
- [Kendra] I love the double door entry.

232
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:20,296
That is fun.

233
00:07:20,296 --> 00:07:22,129
And these light woods.

234
00:07:23,448 --> 00:07:24,281
Wow.

235
00:07:25,175 --> 00:07:27,024
Are you interior designing it?

236
00:07:27,024 --> 00:07:28,433
- Oval table.

237
00:07:28,433 --> 00:07:31,187
- [Kendra] A soft carpet
and a table right here?

238
00:07:31,187 --> 00:07:32,912
- And then a couch right here.

239
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:34,175
- [Kendra] Ohhh!

240
00:07:34,175 --> 00:07:36,381
This deck is really pretty.

241
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:38,158
And there's trees back here.

242
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,408
Is this the master bedroom?

243
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,449
Oh! That's so pretty!

244
00:07:45,272 --> 00:07:46,134
I love it!

245
00:07:46,134 --> 00:07:48,800
- [Elise] I can see a picture.

246
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,649
(giggles)

247
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:50,897
- The interesting thing about coming out

248
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,591
and doing the Parade of Homes
is that there are things

249
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:54,495
I love about each of the houses I see.

250
00:07:54,495 --> 00:07:55,952
Like, they're beautiful and they're new

251
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,977
and they smell clean and some of them have

252
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,098
a lot more space than our house.

253
00:08:00,098 --> 00:08:02,878
But, at the end of the day,
like, as we're heading home,

254
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:05,496
I'm just sitting here
thinking, I love my house.

255
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,016
I really, really do.

256
00:08:07,016 --> 00:08:09,545
I love the space is just
exactly what we need right now.

257
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:11,968
And that's how I know it's
not time to move. Yet.

258
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:12,801
- [Child] A door!

259
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,511
- [Kendra] What did you guys find?

260
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:16,269
- [Elise] A secret hiding spot.

261
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:18,094
(giggles)

262
00:08:18,094 --> 00:08:20,109
- Shut the door, Elise!

263
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:20,942
Bye.

264
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:24,512
(sizzling)

265
00:08:24,512 --> 00:08:26,670
- [Kendra] Dad made dinner.

266
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,784
- [Jeremy] Yay.

267
00:08:27,784 --> 00:08:29,280
- [Kendra] Thank you, Daddy.

268
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,113
- Mmm-hmmm.

269
00:08:30,113 --> 00:08:32,701
- [Kendra] Some day
we'll feed you real food.

270
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:35,962
- Tonight Kendra picked
up a S'mores pie for us

271
00:08:35,962 --> 00:08:37,193
before we go to bed.

272
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:39,294
- This is so good.

273
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:41,755
The toasted marshmallow
with the graham cracker

274
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,568
and the chocolate.

275
00:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,314
- What did you want to show us?

276
00:08:45,314 --> 00:08:46,787
- [Kendra] I wanted to show you the moon!

277
00:08:46,787 --> 00:08:49,035
It's a full moon tonight,
or an almost full moon,

278
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:50,851
and it's beautiful.

279
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:52,332
The clouds are in front of it now

280
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,010
but it was so beautiful.

281
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,798
- [Jeremy] It still looks beautiful.

282
00:08:57,798 --> 00:09:00,504
- [Kendra] Ready? Set? Go!

283
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,720
(giggles)

284
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,137
- Ready? Set? Go!

285
00:09:06,174 --> 00:09:07,949
Ready? Set? Go!

286
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:10,440
(giggles)

287
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,873
Ready? Set? Go!

288
00:09:11,873 --> 00:09:12,956
Growl! Growl!

289
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,140
- [Child] What is that?

290
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,348
(Kendra laughing)

291
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,018
- [Kendra] It's, like, a swan!

292
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:19,947
It's a duck!

293
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:22,280
Can we disappear into each other?

294
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,880
(laughter)

295
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,963
- [Child] Ready? Set? Go!

296
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:29,280
- [Kendra] One ... two ... three.

297
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,113
Arms out!

298
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,354
(laughter)

299
00:09:36,477 --> 00:09:38,327
- [Jeremy] We're trying to make a J House.

300
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,479
- [Kendra] And my head's the chimney.

301
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,499
Did it work?

302
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,067
Did we make a J House?

303
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,355
- [Jeremy] We're a J House.

304
00:09:45,355 --> 00:09:46,781
- [Child] Goodnight. J House out.

305
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:48,652
- [Kendra] What did you find, Janae?

306
00:09:48,652 --> 00:09:50,684
- Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha.

307
00:09:50,684 --> 00:09:53,267
(upbeat music)

308
00:09:58,158 --> 00:10:00,138
- [Crowd] Touchdown!

309
00:10:00,138 --> 00:00:00,000
(excited yelling)
