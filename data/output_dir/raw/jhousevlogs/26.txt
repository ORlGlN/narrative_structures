1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,237
- Daddy said we have to run,

2
00:00:02,237 --> 00:00:04,504
and Garrett was trying to get us.

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,087
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:09,966
- (Mom) Whoa, what are you?

5
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:11,101
- This is Caleb.

6
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,595
- And I found two shirts that I like.

7
00:00:13,595 --> 00:00:16,178
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:17,156 --> 00:00:19,902
So Miss Laura has set
up a store this morning.

9
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:21,840
What kind of a store do you have?

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,237
- It has this money and
this is a check mark,

11
00:00:26,237 --> 00:00:27,621
and you put it in this.

12
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:29,417
(beeping)

13
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,960
- So your store just has money?

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,793
- Yeah.

15
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:33,615
- Can I buy anything at your store?

16
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:34,448
- Yeah.

17
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:36,364
- Did you do your makeup this morning?

18
00:00:36,364 --> 00:00:37,634
- Yep.

19
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:38,914
- It looks nice.

20
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:39,947
All right, well,

21
00:00:39,947 --> 00:00:42,371
my little baby would
like this little lamb-y.

22
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,204
(baby coos)

23
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:44,047
Aww.

24
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:45,164
- That's fine with me.

25
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:47,156
- So how much money is it?

26
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:48,489
- Uh, this much.

27
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:51,533
- OK, lets see what that is.

28
00:00:51,533 --> 00:00:53,144
Oh, that's a penny!

29
00:00:53,144 --> 00:00:53,977
Awesome.

30
00:00:53,977 --> 00:00:55,951
OK, here you go, here's your penny.

31
00:00:55,951 --> 00:00:57,570
- I'm going to Lydia's house.

32
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,403
- Today?

33
00:00:58,403 --> 00:00:59,598
It's gonna be fun.

34
00:00:59,598 --> 00:01:00,915
Good morning.

35
00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:05,260
I have been thinking a lot
this morning about vlogging.

36
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,247
When Jeremy and I were in San
Diego it was so easy to film.

37
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:09,963
We were doing so many new and interesting

38
00:01:09,963 --> 00:01:12,471
and exciting things, and
what we both realized

39
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:15,234
is since we've been home
we're both kind of feeling

40
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:17,071
out of the groove with filming.

41
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:19,207
We're not doing anything
new or interesting

42
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,187
or exciting here, and so we kind of feel

43
00:01:21,187 --> 00:01:24,094
like we don't have anything worth sharing,

44
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:26,089
and we were just discussing that feeling

45
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:28,750
because we never wanted, like
we didn't create our vlog

46
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,694
to share like the biggest, most
exciting things we ever do,

47
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:34,984
like we started it to
share our daily life,

48
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:37,620
and our daily memories
and like the good stuff

49
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,737
that happened every day.

50
00:01:38,737 --> 00:01:40,243
I guess like I feel like our life

51
00:01:40,243 --> 00:01:42,209
is not interesting enough
when we're just home,

52
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:44,681
which is just ridiculous because
we filmed for three years,

53
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,848
just our daily life at
home, but when we go

54
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:48,988
on this big adventure,
all of a sudden I'm like,

55
00:01:48,988 --> 00:01:51,175
"Oh, our regular life is lame."

56
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:53,091
Our regular life isn't boring.

57
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:54,694
It's just kind of routine.

58
00:01:54,694 --> 00:01:55,917
You know, we've got basketball.

59
00:01:55,917 --> 00:01:56,830
We've got gymnastics.

60
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,512
So the moral of the story is,

61
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,589
Jeremy and I were talking last night,

62
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:05,252
and we just decided to focus
again on why we have this vlog.

63
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:06,988
What is the purpose behind it?

64
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,806
And really there's a couple reasons.

65
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:11,626
One of them is we want
to preserve and remember

66
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:14,027
our family memories, and the other one is,

67
00:02:14,027 --> 00:02:16,988
we want to see and look
for the good in each day,

68
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:18,960
and remind all of us of the beauty

69
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,845
that's in daily family life.

70
00:02:20,845 --> 00:02:22,307
It is cold and rainy today,

71
00:02:22,307 --> 00:02:23,938
so I'm grateful that we have gymnastics

72
00:02:23,938 --> 00:02:25,071
to get us out of the house,

73
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,624
and get the kids to get some energy out.

74
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:30,541
(energizing music)

75
00:02:38,547 --> 00:02:39,880
Can you say yay?

76
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,051
Yay.

77
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:43,135
She's cheering.

78
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:44,888
She really just wants to get out there

79
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:46,743
and just play with them.

80
00:02:46,743 --> 00:02:49,660
(energizing music)

81
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:52,754
OK guys,

82
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:55,077
I'm a little embarrassed
because I've been struggling

83
00:02:55,077 --> 00:02:56,514
since we got home from our trip.

84
00:02:56,514 --> 00:02:58,761
I have not gotten back into
a good grocery shopping,

85
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:02,153
meal planning groove, and I
just need to and I haven't,

86
00:03:02,153 --> 00:03:04,661
so today we are out of food once again,

87
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:08,340
but we are headed out to
eat at McAlister's Deli.

88
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,978
They have a 99 cent kids meal option

89
00:03:10,978 --> 00:03:13,483
that's actually pretty good,
so that's why we're here,

90
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:14,316
and?

91
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:15,473
- I forgot her clothes.

92
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:17,318
- (laughing) Jeremy forgot her clothes.

93
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:19,247
- So we're just gonna keep
her in pajamas all day.

94
00:03:19,247 --> 00:03:20,080
- It's warmer.

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,931
It's warmer.

96
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:23,965
We're also back in the car
because we already went in once,

97
00:03:23,965 --> 00:03:26,496
and we all struggled
to behave appropriately

98
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:29,072
for a restaurant, so we came out,

99
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:31,911
had a little chat about how we behave,

100
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,104
and we're gonna go in and do it again.

101
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:34,937
(laughing)

102
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,465
- They were looking at the funny mirror.

103
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:38,575
(yelling)

104
00:03:38,575 --> 00:03:40,295
- Who wants to go try
again at the restaurant?

105
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:42,471
- [All Together] Me!

106
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:44,539
- Let's bring the tone down a little bit.

107
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:46,753
A little quieter and respectful-er.

108
00:03:46,753 --> 00:03:48,082
- Who wants to go back in?

109
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:49,124
- [All Together] Me!

110
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:50,937
- Oh, I would like to mother.

111
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,706
So just after we walked
into the restaurant,

112
00:03:52,706 --> 00:03:56,662
Aunt Ashley and Elizabeth
came in at the same time.

113
00:03:56,662 --> 00:03:57,912
Elizabeth, hey!

114
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:02,706
(soft upbeat music)

115
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,224
I don't think Nae-nae
has had a pickle before.

116
00:04:11,224 --> 00:04:12,807
You want to try it?

117
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:16,937
She loves it.

118
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:18,810
- She does!

119
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,930
She likes it!

120
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,379
All right, so help me out

121
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,215
with getting back on
track with meal planning,

122
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:24,730
and in the comments let me know

123
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,306
what's one of your favorite dinners,

124
00:04:26,306 --> 00:04:27,417
and bonus points if it's easy

125
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:28,962
or if I can use my crockpot with it,

126
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:32,542
because that's more likely
to get actually cooked.

127
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:34,271
- We thought we would head to Petco.

128
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,183
Janae likes nothing more than seeing pets.

129
00:04:36,183 --> 00:04:37,042
(yells)

130
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:39,909
And as a side note, it was
61 degrees this morning

131
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:42,145
at seven something when
I took the trash out,

132
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:44,673
and it's a lot colder.

133
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:47,256
(upbeat music)

134
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,554
Do you see it back here on the corner?

135
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:01,339
Uh oh, they're sneaking around.

136
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,922
(upbeat music)

137
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,766
- (young boy) I want a mouse.

138
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,114
It's only four dollars.

139
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:11,015
I'll be willing to pay for a mouse.

140
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:12,934
- And everything that goes with it?

141
00:05:12,934 --> 00:05:14,511
- [Dad] You'd have to take care of it,

142
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:16,099
but how much is the cage?

143
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:17,648
- And if you get it out of the cage

144
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:19,443
and it runs away in my house.

145
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:21,272
What do you see?

146
00:05:21,272 --> 00:05:23,601
Yeah, you see the little animals, huh?

147
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:24,851
Those are mice.

148
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:27,880
Do you like the mice?

149
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,297
So this one is the chameleon,

150
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,820
and this one is the iguana.

151
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,576
(happy music)

152
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:40,581
- I love goldfish.

153
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:43,189
I like the green ones
because they stand out.

154
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:44,932
- [Mom] You like the green ones?

155
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:46,245
- They don't have food.

156
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,032
- They don't have food?
- No.

157
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:49,945
- No, they feed them.

158
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:52,892
(soft, upbeat music)

159
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,865
- [Mom] That is a pet I don't ever want.

160
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:57,997
- It's a snake.

161
00:05:57,997 --> 00:05:59,509
- It's a snake.

162
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:02,174
- Oh, here's the bearded dragon.

163
00:06:02,174 --> 00:06:05,154
- Mom, are you picking up Isaac and?

164
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:06,347
- He can't see!

165
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:07,782
- I can pick him up.

166
00:06:07,782 --> 00:06:08,971
See him?

167
00:06:08,971 --> 00:06:10,559
Look, they have little crickets in there.

168
00:06:10,559 --> 00:06:12,264
They're gonna eat them.

169
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,406
- [Mom] Is that what bearded dragons eat?

170
00:06:14,406 --> 00:06:16,511
- I wouldn't think they'd just happen

171
00:06:16,511 --> 00:06:18,387
to put those in there with them.

172
00:06:18,387 --> 00:06:19,220
Hello.

173
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,347
How are you doing today?

174
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,020
I'm doing all right.

175
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,385
(upbeat music)

176
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:30,455
So apparently a new cat was
just brought into Petco.

177
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:32,872
(jazz music)

178
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:38,061
- I made an Olympic torch.

179
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:41,978
So it's 20 inches tall,
and it's not breakable.

180
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:45,558
It's made out of like plastic, kind of.

181
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:48,144
To keep it going it's kind of electric.

182
00:06:48,144 --> 00:06:49,350
- So we're getting to play

183
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,358
with some of our really
good friends today,

184
00:06:51,358 --> 00:06:53,421
and I was going to video the
kids running up to the door,

185
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:55,185
and I didn't get out
the camera fast enough.

186
00:06:55,185 --> 00:06:56,915
They are already inside
playing with their friends.

187
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,629
They haven't seen them since
we came home from San Diego,

188
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,119
and they're really excited.

189
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,166
And Janae's gonna be happy here too.

190
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,213
There's the doggy.

191
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,240
There's Hannah.

192
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,073
Hi, Hannah.

193
00:07:05,073 --> 00:07:05,990
Hi, Hannah.

194
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,023
Hi.

195
00:07:08,023 --> 00:07:11,440
So Hannah is the nicest dog in the world.

196
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:14,488
Aww, so nice.

197
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:17,468
Dog, woof woof.

198
00:07:17,468 --> 00:07:18,301
Hi, dog.

199
00:07:19,896 --> 00:07:21,154
Whoa.

200
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:22,873
Be careful with that thing.

201
00:07:22,873 --> 00:07:24,125
What are you?

202
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:24,958
- A gecko.

203
00:07:27,732 --> 00:07:30,719
- See, we're not allowed
to play until (mumbling).

204
00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:32,675
- [Mom] Hi, bunny.

205
00:07:32,675 --> 00:07:34,368
That's a bunny.

206
00:07:34,368 --> 00:07:35,201
Hi.

207
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,454
Oh, is this your makeup?

208
00:07:38,454 --> 00:07:39,982
That's quite the costume.

209
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,509
What are you guys playing?

210
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:44,646
- House, where there
was a really bad storm.

211
00:07:44,646 --> 00:07:46,195
- Oh dear.

212
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:48,534
- With bad guys and stuff.

213
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:50,049
- A storm with bad guys?

214
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:51,923
- So we had to run!

215
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,931
And Garrett was trying to get us.

216
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:56,782
- Oh, did you guys get away?

217
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:57,615
- Yeah.

218
00:07:57,615 --> 00:07:58,679
- Lacey, where you guys headed?

219
00:07:58,679 --> 00:07:59,512
- To the woods.

220
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,910
And we brought water bottles,
and an extra water bottles.

221
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,261
- And walkie talkies?

222
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:06,094
- Uh huh.

223
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:08,129
- Hello, Michael.

224
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:09,296
This is Caleb.

225
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,105
- So the kids are going
in the backyard to play,

226
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:13,234
but they're packing up

227
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:15,002
like they're going to be gone for a week.

228
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:18,452
I think the packing up is part of the fun.

229
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:20,022
(soft music)

230
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:22,513
There they are, headed off.

231
00:08:22,513 --> 00:08:25,763
(piano playing softly)

232
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,584
- So we did our freezer meal tonight.

233
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,098
It's been awhile since we did that.

234
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:32,658
We put sesame chicken in
the crockpot, had some rice,

235
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:35,006
and when I mix it up when
I'm doing it for the kids,

236
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:37,469
I just stick it in big bowls
and mix it all up at once

237
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,835
so I don't have to do it
individually for each of the kids.

238
00:08:39,835 --> 00:08:41,260
- I'm trying to clean up after dinner

239
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:43,256
and load the dishwasher, and
I have a little helper here,

240
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,479
who's being a little too helpful.

241
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:49,373
She keeps pulling all of the utensils out.

242
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:51,981
Luckily she's not eating them.

243
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,044
Those are supposed to go
in here, little Missy.

244
00:08:54,044 --> 00:08:54,877
See?

245
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,856
There we go.

246
00:08:57,856 --> 00:08:59,883
Yeah, what is this?

247
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:00,716
Oh, no.

248
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,563
Looks like I'm gonna need to
find something to occupy Janae

249
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,425
before I finish the dishes.

250
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,046
She's so cute though.

251
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:14,448
- OK.

252
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,281
All right.

253
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:18,245
So that was Kendra.

254
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,785
I'm gonna be meeting them for lunch.

255
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:24,512
This morning I've really
been thinking a lot

256
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,293
about my life.

257
00:09:26,293 --> 00:09:30,325
My decisions that I've made
in the last couple years,

258
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:33,328
and I'm wanting to make some changes.

259
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:36,989
Specifically I've been thinking
about my own willingness

260
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:39,652
to submit to God's will.

261
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:43,741
Like, when I think of Jesus
Christ in the scriptures,

262
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:46,866
that may have been one
of the most important

263
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:49,698
and significant things we can learn,

264
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:52,331
if we're wanting to be like him,

265
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:55,581
is to submit to the will of the Father.

266
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:59,182
I think that's maybe one of
the most important lessons

267
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:01,006
to learn from the scriptures

268
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:04,064
is that we need to do God's Will,

269
00:10:04,064 --> 00:10:09,031
above our own needs or
desires or selfish ambitions.

270
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,760
And I was just thinking, like,

271
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,553
about all the time that I put
into my businesses, you know,

272
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:17,546
I mean 10 to 20 hours a day sometimes.

273
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:19,396
Sometimes I'm not even willing

274
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:22,736
to give a sincere prayer to God,

275
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:26,069
and that's heartbreaking,
and embarrassing,

276
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:28,098
and needs to change.

277
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:30,646
And what if I was willing
to give an hour a day

278
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:34,215
to really thinking, and
praying, and meditating,

279
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,811
and pondering, like,

280
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:38,222
God, what do you want me to do today?

281
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:40,944
And then being willing,

282
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:44,715
and have the courage to do those things.

283
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:47,548
I really want to make that change.

284
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:53,405
And I think even more is I
don't want to make that change

285
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:57,536
for a day or a week, but really
make that change in my heart

286
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:59,869
so that it can last forever.

287
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:04,087
So there's been times of my life

288
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:06,754
when I was more focused on that,

289
00:11:07,908 --> 00:11:12,065
and felt that power and the
blessings that come from that,

290
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:14,479
but life gets busy, and I get distracted,

291
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:17,031
and I fall back into
more selfish patterns.

292
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:18,981
The question I often
ask myself is, you know,

293
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:20,543
when's that last time I really thought

294
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:23,464
I got inspiration from God,

295
00:11:23,464 --> 00:11:25,136
and I think another good question is,

296
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:28,427
when's the last time I really
sought for that and wanted it?

297
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:30,262
And I know from times in past that

298
00:11:30,262 --> 00:11:33,246
when I actually am
looking for that from God,

299
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:36,449
and I'm following
direction and inspiration,

300
00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:37,754
I'm so much happier,

301
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:40,216
and I'm doing so much
more good in the world.

302
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:43,385
I need help in being a better
father, a better husband,

303
00:11:43,385 --> 00:11:46,238
better in my business,
better in my church setting

304
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,565
and in my community.

305
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:50,088
Side note, I was supposed
to pick up clothes for Janae

306
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,375
and bring them here

307
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,591
and I forgot because I
was thinking about this,

308
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,918
but why would I think

309
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:59,347
that I can do those
things better by myself?

310
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:02,190
Because I've seen my life
over and over and over again

311
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:06,082
that if I have God's help,
and I'm willing to reach out

312
00:12:06,082 --> 00:12:09,333
and follow inspiration,
it all goes better.

313
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:13,250
So I want to make another
attempt, another try,

314
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:17,164
a do over, which is what's
great about the gospel.

315
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:21,230
It's all about this opportunity
to keep trying again,

316
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,810
and to get help from God.

317
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:28,285
You know, that by grace we
can be clean, and be better,

318
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,708
and have another chance to do the things

319
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:34,605
we've been asked to do, and
be what we're meant to be.

320
00:12:34,605 --> 00:12:36,115
So I'd love to hear in the comments

321
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:37,627
what you're working on right now,

322
00:12:37,627 --> 00:12:39,766
what's something you're
wanting to improve on

323
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,526
and change in your life?

324
00:12:41,526 --> 00:12:43,157
Let me know in the comments.

325
00:12:43,157 --> 00:12:45,211
So Kendra went to the store today for,

326
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,570
I think it was 20 minutes, 15 maybe.

327
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,838
- It was pretty short, and I
found two shirts that I like.

328
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:51,854
- They are cute.

329
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,930
- There's this one.
- I like it.

330
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,013
- And then there's this one,
which I rarely wear yellow,

331
00:12:57,013 --> 00:12:59,295
so that was really exciting to me.

332
00:12:59,295 --> 00:13:00,894
- [Dad] And the sleeves are fun.

333
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:03,395
- And there was a sale going on, so,

334
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:05,957
I, if you don't know,
absolutely hate shopping.

335
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:07,982
One of the big problems
is that I only shop

336
00:13:07,982 --> 00:13:10,048
when I absolutely have to buy something,

337
00:13:10,048 --> 00:13:13,785
and so one of my goals was to
just try casually shopping,

338
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:14,904
and it worked!

339
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:16,576
- And you didn't have to?
- Yeah!

340
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:17,421
- [Kid] Good night.

341
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,297
J house out.

342
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,880
Backwards day and forwards day!

343
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,648
(intense music)

344
00:13:24,648 --> 00:13:26,898
(cheering)

345
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,837
- Hidden drawer up there.

346
00:13:30,837 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Dad] You wouldn't
even know it was there.
