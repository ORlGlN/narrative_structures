1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,778
- [Jeremy] Sometimes you
need to get a picture,

2
00:00:01,778 --> 00:00:05,354
you gotta climb with
your family down a cliff.

3
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:08,512
- Getting a family of seven
ready for family pictures,

4
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:10,486
it's not a joke.

5
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:12,599
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,062
- You can't be in California without going

7
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:15,432
to In and Out Burger.

8
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,015
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:26,828
Well Janae and most of the kids got up

10
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:28,872
very early this morning.

11
00:00:28,872 --> 00:00:31,455
(upbeat music)

12
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:47,053
There you go.

13
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,136
- [Child] That's so cute.

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,912
- [Jeremy] What are you girls working on?

15
00:01:02,912 --> 00:01:05,579
- What we did yesterday and then

16
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:10,087
writing things we're thankful for.

17
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:11,713
- [Jeremy] So every morning the kids

18
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:13,663
are writing in a gratitude journal.

19
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:17,169
- Lights, food, lunch, dinner, breakfast.

20
00:01:17,169 --> 00:01:19,468
- [Jeremy] So you're grateful for meals?

21
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:21,511
That's a good one.

22
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,847
Some people don't get a meal at breakfast

23
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:25,194
and lunch and dinner.

24
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:27,075
- Sometimes they get one of these.

25
00:01:27,075 --> 00:01:28,282
- [Jeremy] Or none.

26
00:01:28,282 --> 00:01:30,865
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:32,021 --> 00:01:33,271
Family snuggle.

28
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,804
- Mama's still tired.

29
00:01:36,804 --> 00:01:39,387
- [Jeremy] But we're snuggling.

30
00:01:40,403 --> 00:01:42,005
- It's a good thing this
is a king sized bed.

31
00:01:42,005 --> 00:01:44,490
- Just lay on top of us.

32
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,073
(upbeat music)

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,245
- It's been so fun having my parents here

34
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,871
and today's their last day with us.

35
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:55,403
They're headed home tomorrow morning.

36
00:01:55,403 --> 00:01:57,540
(upbeat music)

37
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,349
- Well today is Martin
Luther King Day, MLK Day

38
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:02,996
or a national day of service.

39
00:02:02,996 --> 00:02:05,388
So our congregation here in San Diego

40
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,710
for the last 10 years does an interfaith

41
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,916
service project with
several other churches,

42
00:02:09,916 --> 00:02:12,865
Muslims, Jews, Christians,
they all get together

43
00:02:12,865 --> 00:02:15,163
to serve on MLK Day.

44
00:02:15,163 --> 00:02:16,835
Today we're gonna be beautifying

45
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,530
and cleaning up Balboa Park,

46
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,760
which is a famous park here in San Diego.

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,343
(upbeat music)

48
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:48,066
- I'm allergic to onions and wood

49
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,387
and oranges since I don't like them.

50
00:02:51,387 --> 00:02:53,012
- [Kendra] Oh so you're allergic to onions

51
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:54,727
and wood and oranges?

52
00:02:54,727 --> 00:02:55,749
- Yeah.

53
00:02:55,749 --> 00:02:57,188
- [Kendra] How do you know you're allergic

54
00:02:57,188 --> 00:02:58,489
to onions and wood?

55
00:02:58,489 --> 00:02:59,673
- I don't know.

56
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:01,043
- [Kendra] How can you tell?

57
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:01,876
- Because.

58
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:08,891
- [Kendra] You're crazy.

59
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:09,808
I like you.

60
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:13,233
So while Jeremy and Papa have the big kids

61
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,277
at the service project at Balboa Park,

62
00:03:15,277 --> 00:03:16,902
Grandma and I are taking the girls

63
00:03:16,902 --> 00:03:18,435
to get some errands done.

64
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:20,501
First I obviously have
to get ready for the day,

65
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:22,800
which by the way, the
injustice of the universe

66
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,843
we are taking family pictures today

67
00:03:24,843 --> 00:03:26,426
and check this out.

68
00:03:27,398 --> 00:03:30,393
Yep, zits on family
pictures day, it's a thing.

69
00:03:30,393 --> 00:03:34,828
- [Man] As Dr. King said,
keep moving forward,

70
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:37,411
fly, walk, crawl, do something.

71
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:42,514
Don't be passive and
there are so many things

72
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:47,367
that we can come all together
and work all together on.

73
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:49,617
(applause)

74
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:55,563
- Now is the time to lift our nation

75
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:57,862
from the quicksands of racial injustice

76
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,347
to the solid rock of brotherhood.

77
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:02,808
Now is the time to make justice a reality

78
00:04:02,808 --> 00:04:04,975
for all of God's children.

79
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,977
(piano music)

80
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:27,732
- [Kendra] Yes Mommom, that's me.

81
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,265
So this is Jeremy's toothbrush.

82
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:30,797
Don't tell him I gave it to her.

83
00:04:30,797 --> 00:04:33,282
I rinsed it out really good first.

84
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:35,654
But it's on, like the power's on right now

85
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,698
and so it's vibrating.

86
00:04:37,698 --> 00:04:40,856
She does not know what to do with it.

87
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:43,154
What do you think big girl?

88
00:04:43,154 --> 00:04:44,873
- Dad, I found chopsticks.

89
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:46,243
- [Jeremy] Maybe we should keep those.

90
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,752
Alright, so we're cleaning up leaves

91
00:04:47,752 --> 00:04:48,959
and then we're gonna spread this mulch

92
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,747
all through this area of the park.

93
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:53,247
(piano music)

94
00:04:58,178 --> 00:04:59,548
I think that this is one of those moments

95
00:04:59,548 --> 00:05:01,405
when humanity is at its best.

96
00:05:01,405 --> 00:05:04,308
When racial, ethnic,
social barriers are dropped

97
00:05:04,308 --> 00:05:07,048
and we're all working
together for our common good.

98
00:05:07,048 --> 00:05:08,510
Just really excited that we heard

99
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,624
about this opportunity while
we're here in San Diego

100
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:13,781
to help make a difference in
one of the parks that's here.

101
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:15,244
So they were a little short on rakes

102
00:05:15,244 --> 00:05:17,411
so we're getting creative.

103
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,446
The park looks a lot better.

104
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,164
- That's what we did.

105
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:23,348
(upbeat music)

106
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:26,515
- I need to talk to Moana on my phone.

107
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:29,408
She can't come with us.

108
00:05:29,408 --> 00:05:32,218
- [Kendra] You want Moana
to come with us to Target?

109
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:33,135
- Yep, yep.

110
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,398
- Well my least favorite
part of family pictures

111
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:38,278
is trying to figure out
what we're all wearing.

112
00:05:38,278 --> 00:05:40,159
For some reason it stresses me out.

113
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,713
But I've got it mostly figured out,

114
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,292
which is a good thing
'cause it's this afternoon.

115
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,871
I just need a different shirt for Isaac

116
00:05:45,871 --> 00:05:48,356
and a little bit of something for her.

117
00:05:48,356 --> 00:05:49,356
Hi, hi guys.

118
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,025
So when we came home from
the beach the other day

119
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:53,139
and were covered in the sand,

120
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:54,927
in the comments somebody
suggested that we put baby powder

121
00:05:54,927 --> 00:05:56,367
on the kids beforehand and then apparently

122
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,946
the sand will come right off.

123
00:05:57,946 --> 00:05:59,525
So we're gonna try it.

124
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,009
(upbeat music)

125
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:03,193
- You can't be in California without

126
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,074
going to In & Out Burger.

127
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:07,657
(upbeat music)

128
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,773
Good bite.

129
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,929
- So from my bed, I can
see out onto the patio

130
00:06:23,929 --> 00:06:25,903
and I keep watching the birds out here.

131
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:28,532
They keep flying into
this one light fixture.

132
00:06:28,532 --> 00:06:30,830
Upon closer inspection there's a nest.

133
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,733
And I'm wondering if there's
any eggs in the nest,

134
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:35,900
so I'm gonna try to check.

135
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:39,027
- Anything in there?

136
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:40,978
- [Kendra] I can't tell, it keeps,

137
00:06:40,978 --> 00:06:42,789
the bird keeps flying
up here so I'm trying to

138
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,038
see if there's like eggs
or something up there.

139
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:49,267
I'm trying to get all the way up in there.

140
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:51,728
- [Jeremy] Alright, we decided after lunch

141
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:55,583
to play some Monopoly, Disney version.

142
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:57,115
You guys excited, this is your first time

143
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,555
to play real Monopoly.

144
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:00,598
We've done Monopoly Jr.

145
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:03,756
Elise has castles and
if Papa rolls a three

146
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:06,589
or a five, he owes a ton of money.

147
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:09,143
- Eight.

148
00:07:09,143 --> 00:07:10,165
- [Jeremy] Oh he made it.

149
00:07:10,165 --> 00:07:11,187
- One, two, three,

150
00:07:11,187 --> 00:07:13,671
four, five, six, seven, eight.

151
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:14,948
Oh, I'm on my own property.

152
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:16,829
- [Jeremy] Elise is
trying to make it through

153
00:07:16,829 --> 00:07:18,662
all of Papa's castles.

154
00:07:20,893 --> 00:07:22,448
You did it.

155
00:07:22,448 --> 00:07:23,948
One, two, three...

156
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,623
So after playing Monopoly,
what do you give it as a game?

157
00:07:29,623 --> 00:07:30,993
- I loved it.

158
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,526
It's kind of like Life.

159
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:35,684
Basically you have your own experience

160
00:07:35,684 --> 00:07:38,238
and decide what you wanna
do and you can trade

161
00:07:38,238 --> 00:07:40,119
and stuff like that.

162
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:43,695
- Poll question, do you like Monopoly?

163
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,506
Let us know in the poll.

164
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,619
So Laura, what are we getting ready for?

165
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:48,919
(laughter)

166
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:50,359
- Family pictures.

167
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,636
- [Jeremy] Family pictures.

168
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:52,913
- On the beach.

169
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:55,467
Getting a family of seven
ready for family pictures,

170
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,441
it's not a joke.

171
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,415
- [Jeremy] Serious,
it's a full time thing.

172
00:07:59,415 --> 00:08:00,506
- It's a lot of work.

173
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:03,246
(upbeat music)

174
00:08:03,246 --> 00:08:05,034
I really don't like doing
strip family pictures.

175
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,822
It super stresses me out
and either does Jeremy,

176
00:08:06,822 --> 00:08:10,073
but I did a poll for an Instastories

177
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,278
and the majority of people
like doing family pictures.

178
00:08:12,278 --> 00:08:15,692
I think maybe we need to figure out

179
00:08:15,692 --> 00:08:17,573
an easier way to do it.

180
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:19,709
- Family pictures while eating donuts.

181
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,449
- There we go, that's
actually not a bad idea.

182
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:23,981
While we're driving, I'm trying to decide

183
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,514
which earring I'm wearing.

184
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:26,884
I have studs on this side

185
00:08:26,884 --> 00:08:29,275
and my fun big earrings on this side.

186
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,971
So I decided to do a quick Instastory

187
00:08:30,971 --> 00:08:32,433
to get people's opinions and guess what?

188
00:08:32,433 --> 00:08:35,405
It's like 51%, 49%.

189
00:08:35,405 --> 00:08:37,889
So that's really no help.

190
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,515
So now I'm just nervous I'm gonna forget

191
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,466
and accidentally wear
two different earrings.

192
00:08:41,466 --> 00:08:44,049
(upbeat music)

193
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:50,629
(orchestral music)

194
00:08:57,673 --> 00:08:58,881
- Sometimes you need to get a picture

195
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,294
you gotta climb with
your family down a cliff.

196
00:09:02,294 --> 00:09:04,877
(upbeat music)

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,290
So Shawna was a friend from
college that Kendra and I knew.

198
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,845
And she lives here in the area

199
00:09:21,845 --> 00:09:25,845
and is doing our pictures,
we're really excited.

200
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:32,503
- [Shawna] Caleb, you taste like pizza.

201
00:09:33,937 --> 00:09:36,187
- Everybody look at Shawna.

202
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:39,835
- [Jeremy] You're so gorgeous.

203
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,002
- Spin around.

204
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:45,515
Spin around again.

205
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:50,266
(upbeat music)

206
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:02,129
One, two, three, no, no.

207
00:10:03,032 --> 00:10:04,402
- Well I learned that you don't need

208
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,445
to do your hair before you
come take pictures at the beach

209
00:10:06,445 --> 00:10:08,419
because it's so windy.

210
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,625
But it's gorgeous out here and I'm excited

211
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,542
to see how our pictures turned out.

212
00:10:15,663 --> 00:10:18,310
Check out this seashell.

213
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,560
Oh my goodness.

214
00:10:20,865 --> 00:10:21,865
- Can I see?

215
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:25,020
- [Kendra] Look at it.

216
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:28,311
- [Jeremy] They've wandered off.

217
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:30,894
(upbeat music)

218
00:10:50,765 --> 00:10:52,205
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

219
00:10:52,205 --> 00:10:53,575
- [Kendra] Where are we at?

220
00:10:53,575 --> 00:10:54,575
- The beach!

221
00:10:55,804 --> 00:10:57,847
- [Kendra] Were you keeping watch for us?

222
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:00,216
(laughter)

223
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:02,445
- This is so fun.

224
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:06,973
- Donut with cookies and
cream ice cream and sprinkles.

225
00:11:06,973 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
