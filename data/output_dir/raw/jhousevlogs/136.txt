1
00:00:00,344 --> 00:00:01,403
- Today might be the day.

2
00:00:01,403 --> 00:00:03,149
Look at the subscriber button.

3
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,360
We are almost at a million subscribers.

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,248
- It's unbelievable.

5
00:00:06,248 --> 00:00:07,612
- It really is.
- It's crazy.

6
00:00:07,612 --> 00:00:10,413
- And thank you, thank you
to every single one of you.

7
00:00:10,413 --> 00:00:13,165
To celebrate hitting
one million subscribers,

8
00:00:13,165 --> 00:00:15,588
we want to do something that
we've never done before.

9
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:18,492
- We're gonna do a service meet-up.

10
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:21,051
- It's gonna be a chance to get
together and serve together.

11
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,645
And we are so excited about it.

12
00:00:22,645 --> 00:00:24,484
So stay tuned on our channel

13
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,776
and on Facebook for more
details about that event.

14
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,609
And?

15
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:28,839
- We should go get our kids.

16
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:29,672
End the vlog.

17
00:00:29,672 --> 00:00:30,505
- Enjoy the vlog.

18
00:00:30,505 --> 00:00:31,733
- It's coming up.

19
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,179
(yelling)

20
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:35,385
(bright music)

21
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:37,635
- [Kendra] Reach your arms.

22
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:41,827
- [All] Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw.

23
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,371
- Good morning, so this morning

24
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:50,714
I am going to a workout group.

25
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:52,931
There's a women's workout
group at my church

26
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:55,003
and it's once a week
and they get together,

27
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:56,546
and it's supposed to be pretty intense.

28
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:58,547
And I have been kind of dragging my feet.

29
00:00:58,547 --> 00:01:00,362
I'm like oh I don't think that works

30
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:01,329
with my schedule,

31
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:04,682
but really I am scared
of working out that much.

32
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,104
Like I am not in good shape

33
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:08,751
since having Janae, and since
being pregnant with Janae.

34
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:09,863
It's like I love working out,

35
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:10,998
but when I work out by myself,

36
00:01:10,998 --> 00:01:13,371
I can just kind of, you know, take it easy

37
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:14,836
and not sweat too much.

38
00:01:14,836 --> 00:01:17,150
And here, if everybody
else is working out,

39
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,489
I'm gonna feel ridiculous if I'm like,

40
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:19,562
mmm, I'm gonna take a break.

41
00:01:19,562 --> 00:01:21,489
And I know at the end of it,

42
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:22,545
I'm gonna be glad I did it,

43
00:01:22,545 --> 00:01:24,238
but I'm honestly scared,
so I'm sitting out here

44
00:01:24,238 --> 00:01:26,901
in my car, just kind of stalling.

45
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:29,035
- You can do it Mom.

46
00:01:29,035 --> 00:01:30,067
- Let's do this.

47
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:33,067
(funky dance music)

48
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:57,745
Well I did it.

49
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:58,967
I made it through the entire workout

50
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,805
and it actually felt really good,

51
00:02:00,805 --> 00:02:01,994
I'm really proud of myself for going.

52
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,734
I'm grateful Jeremy encouraged me to go.

53
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:06,861
And now it's time to start
working out like that regularly.

54
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,072
Elise, can I see your picture?

55
00:02:08,072 --> 00:02:10,122
- Well I'm not exactly done with it,

56
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,144
but I'm done with the main part.

57
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:13,815
And I have a vampire.

58
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:14,954
- [Kendra] On the back?

59
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:17,362
- This is a little fan for my teacher.

60
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:18,899
- [Kendra] Well did you make it?

61
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:19,732
It's beautiful.

62
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:21,062
- Lise helped me.

63
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:22,398
- Dad's having a hard day,

64
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:24,785
because his computer's not working.

65
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:27,648
- [Kendra] So Jeremy got a new computer.

66
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,276
- I've had a lot of problems
with the transition.

67
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,566
Like for some reason my monitor

68
00:02:32,566 --> 00:02:34,024
won't plug into it,

69
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:36,489
and there's all these
adapters you have to have.

70
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,629
When I tried to get the vlog up,

71
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,550
there was no audio on the vlog

72
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,182
and so I'm struggling a little bit

73
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,366
with the computer today.

74
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,991
- [Kendra] It's been a frustrating day.

75
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:49,307
Alright well good luck,

76
00:02:49,307 --> 00:02:52,919
We'll spread fairy dust
of like happy computer

77
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,266
thoughts your way.

78
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,099
- Thank you.

79
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:57,162
- [Kendra] And I'm just glad
you have a diaper down here.

80
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,586
- You need that sometimes.

81
00:02:58,586 --> 00:02:59,419
- [Kendra] You do.

82
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:01,179
- Janae's down here often, so.

83
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:02,012
- Right.

84
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:02,845
So I decided to show some of the kids

85
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:04,773
some of the stuff I did
in my workout group today.

86
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:06,440
20 jumping jacks go.

87
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:08,571
One.

88
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:11,332
(uptempo dance music)

89
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:12,499
One two three.

90
00:03:14,271 --> 00:03:15,895
Everybody make it look like a table

91
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,645
and then you kick up.

92
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,039
Ready?

93
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:23,122
- Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw, hee haw.

94
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,739
- Those are called donkey kicks.

95
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,895
- Is that why we're
making the awesome noise?

96
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:31,462
So we're all together eating lunch

97
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:33,656
and Laura announced that she
had some bad news for us.

98
00:03:33,656 --> 00:03:35,275
What's the bad news Laura?

99
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:38,398
- One time I fell on my back

100
00:03:38,398 --> 00:03:40,065
and I broke my head.

101
00:03:41,193 --> 00:03:43,342
- [Jeremy] When did that happen?

102
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:44,413
- When I was a grandma.

103
00:03:44,413 --> 00:03:45,625
- [Jeremy] Back when you were a grandma?

104
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,655
- Yeah.

105
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,384
- That's really sad,
I'm glad you're better.

106
00:03:48,384 --> 00:03:50,831
I gave Janae one of these pouch thingies.

107
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:53,164
It's apple and sweet potato.

108
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:56,095
Is there food in there?

109
00:03:56,095 --> 00:03:57,737
Yeah, that's fun, huh.

110
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,573
(squealing)

111
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:01,065
Squeeze it up.

112
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,732
Whoa, a little much.

113
00:04:06,024 --> 00:04:07,878
- [Elise] It's so yummy.

114
00:04:07,878 --> 00:04:09,961
- [Kendra] Look at Janae.

115
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,325
I love that the kids can feed themselves

116
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,216
from such a young age with these.

117
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,131
Okay so I've been trying
for about the last hour

118
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,458
to get Janae to take a nap

119
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:20,874
and Laura won't take a nap,

120
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:23,130
and so I'm dealing with both of them

121
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,355
while trying to manage school

122
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,180
and I haven't decided what
we're having for dinner yet

123
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,145
and it's stormy outside,

124
00:04:27,145 --> 00:04:31,218
so it's just kind of overcast and blah.

125
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:33,081
I did finally get Janae to go down,

126
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,682
so we'll see how long she stays down.

127
00:04:34,682 --> 00:04:36,145
So last night when I went shopping,

128
00:04:36,145 --> 00:04:39,058
I bought myself some
amazing dark chocolate,

129
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,663
like the kind that I can
put away in the cupboard

130
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:43,023
and just eat a little at a time.

131
00:04:43,023 --> 00:04:46,043
It even had like a dark
chocolate ganache inside.

132
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:47,266
Apparently I paid for it,

133
00:04:47,266 --> 00:04:49,214
it's on the receipt,
but I lost it somehow,

134
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:50,398
it's not in any of the bags,

135
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:52,527
it hasn't been unloaded
in my house anymore,

136
00:04:52,527 --> 00:04:54,466
so I'm kind of grumpy about the chocolate.

137
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,476
And I know something else went wrong.

138
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:57,094
What was something else that went wrong?

139
00:04:57,094 --> 00:04:58,820
Oh, since I went to workout this morning,

140
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,256
which was awesome,

141
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,046
now I'm still in my workout clothes,

142
00:05:02,046 --> 00:05:03,895
and I can't find time to actually shower

143
00:05:03,895 --> 00:05:05,053
and get ready for the day.

144
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,984
So there we go, Kendra rant.

145
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,381
Kendra rant over.

146
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:10,412
Caleb's doing some math.

147
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,085
Isaac, what are you working on?

148
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:14,621
- I'm working on my spelling test.

149
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,288
- [Kendra] Number one, tomorrow.

150
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,210
I picked this little book up

151
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:22,666
in the dollar bin at the store yesterday

152
00:05:22,666 --> 00:05:26,274
and I think somebody's gonna enjoy it.

153
00:05:26,274 --> 00:05:27,273
What is it?

154
00:05:27,273 --> 00:05:29,893
- It's a Halloween one.

155
00:05:29,893 --> 00:05:30,726
- [Kendra] Yeah it's a coloring book,

156
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:32,380
let's get out some colored pencils.

157
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,213
What's this?

158
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:34,046
- A pumpkin.

159
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:34,879
- [Kendra] Yeah.

160
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:36,141
- I love it.
- With a mustache.

161
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,242
- Thank you Mom.

162
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:40,403
- You're welcome.

163
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:43,403
(atmospheric music)

164
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:53,174
Spelling test number three, he aced it.

165
00:05:53,174 --> 00:05:54,591
You aced it dude.

166
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,576
- It's so creepy.

167
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:00,537
- [Kendra] Did you make that face?

168
00:06:00,537 --> 00:06:02,912
- Yeah, it's a witch one.

169
00:06:02,912 --> 00:06:05,787
- [Kendra] Is that a witch one?

170
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:07,181
That is funny.

171
00:06:07,181 --> 00:06:09,764
(rain falling)

172
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,180
Well you've got to admit
that is a gorgeous view,

173
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,597
even in the rain.

174
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,208
(laughing)

175
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,375
They are loving this Lise.

176
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:37,960
Woo.

177
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,452
- [Kendra] So Elise told
me she could hang out

178
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:41,885
with the girls while I take a shower.

179
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:43,311
And everybody's doing great?

180
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:44,844
- I sit like this.

181
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:47,761
Like this with Janae Nae on my lap.

182
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:52,924
- Ready set go.
- Janae Nae on your lap.

183
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:57,300
- [Kendra] You going slow for Janae?

184
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,133
- Yeah.

185
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:02,133
- This is about as fast
as Laura and Janae like.

186
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:05,132
- [Kendra] So the girls are up here

187
00:07:05,132 --> 00:07:06,858
and the boys are down here.

188
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:08,450
Are you guys playing football?

189
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:09,357
- Yeah.

190
00:07:09,357 --> 00:07:11,357
- He's trying to get me.

191
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:13,482
Touchdown.

192
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,263
Gotcha.

193
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:19,788
- I was able to get the
video up with audio.

194
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:20,621
(bell dings)

195
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:22,639
- [Kendra] Yay, we're so proud of you.

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,822
- Two hours later.

197
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:25,014
- Dad, do you want to play with us?

198
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:25,847
- [Kendra] High five.

199
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:28,011
- Yeah, I'll play with
you, that sounds fun.

200
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:28,844
Okay the plan?

201
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:29,982
You score a touchdown.

202
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,170
- Yeah!

203
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,003
- One two hike.

204
00:07:32,003 --> 00:07:32,836
Get open.

205
00:07:36,001 --> 00:07:37,918
- [Kendra] Oh so close.

206
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,795
- Sut hike.

207
00:07:45,343 --> 00:07:47,593
(laughing)

208
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,732
I'll block for you.

209
00:07:52,705 --> 00:07:54,538
- Oh he didn't get it.

210
00:07:55,965 --> 00:07:57,882
- [Kendra] Go Caleb go.

211
00:07:59,128 --> 00:08:00,826
Go Caleb go.

212
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:02,326
- Touchdown!
- Woo!

213
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,386
- [Kendra] Dad was doing
some great defense.

214
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:09,090
- That's like MC Hammer block move.

215
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,984
Can't touch this.

216
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:11,984
♫ Oh oh

217
00:08:15,938 --> 00:08:18,786
- [Kendra] Oh good catch, good catch.

218
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:20,966
You guys are all doing great.

219
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:23,142
- You gotta block me.

220
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:25,687
(laughing)

221
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:26,937
- [Kendra] Woo!

222
00:08:27,787 --> 00:08:30,595
- All I did was stand here.

223
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:34,488
Well I think the kids are
in a really goofy mood.

224
00:08:34,488 --> 00:08:36,738
(laughing)

225
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,006
So what inspired the madness?

226
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,846
- Laura just had one on,

227
00:08:44,846 --> 00:08:45,763
and we just

228
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:48,677
- [Jeremy] Took it from there?

229
00:08:48,677 --> 00:08:49,788
- Yeah.

230
00:08:49,788 --> 00:08:52,331
Something's coming out.

231
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,948
- [Jeremy] This reminds
me of our first vlog,

232
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:56,413
do you guys remember that?

233
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,540
- Yeah, we had diapers.

234
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,563
(laughing)

235
00:08:58,563 --> 00:09:00,323
- [Jeremy] What's so funny?

236
00:09:00,323 --> 00:09:02,696
- I have a diaper on.

237
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:04,316
Diapers!

238
00:09:04,316 --> 00:09:05,149
- Diapers!

239
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:07,867
- [Jeremy] You had diapers on your head.

240
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:10,396
- That gives me an idea.

241
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:12,646
(laughing)

242
00:09:16,154 --> 00:09:17,236
- Three years have past,

243
00:09:17,236 --> 00:09:19,146
and we haven't changed one bit.

244
00:09:19,146 --> 00:09:20,679
- [Kendra] So check out this cute note

245
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,762
that got left on my door.

246
00:09:23,657 --> 00:09:24,984
(tender music)

247
00:09:24,984 --> 00:09:26,263
Dear Mom I love you,

248
00:09:26,263 --> 00:09:27,655
I know you're having a hard day,

249
00:09:27,655 --> 00:09:29,137
I know that you're tired,

250
00:09:29,137 --> 00:09:32,969
love and kisses, your secret friend.

251
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:36,188
You know, today definately
had some just frustrations,

252
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:39,087
just those little daily
irritations of regular life,

253
00:09:39,087 --> 00:09:41,142
but it also had a lot
of really good moments,

254
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:43,735
and so I'm gonna choose
to celebrate the good.

255
00:09:43,735 --> 00:09:45,272
And tonight, we're gonna literally go

256
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:46,484
celebrate the good.

257
00:09:46,484 --> 00:09:49,778
Elise has worked so stinkin'
hard on her math program.

258
00:09:49,778 --> 00:09:53,315
To we're gonna celebrate
Elise and her hard work today,

259
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:54,429
we're gonna go out to dinner.

260
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,262
- Yay!

261
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,039
- [Kendra] Well I graded it.

262
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,872
Do you want to hear the results?

263
00:09:57,872 --> 00:09:58,753
- Yeah.

264
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,917
- [Kendra] You got 100%.

265
00:10:00,917 --> 00:10:01,750
- Yay!

266
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:04,679
- [Kendra] I'm so proud of you.

267
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,971
Do you want to go celebrate?

268
00:10:05,971 --> 00:10:06,804
- Yeah.

269
00:10:08,421 --> 00:10:12,004
(upbeat atmospheric music)

270
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:30,159
- [Jeremy] Good job Elise.

271
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,576
- I got some too.

272
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:34,425
- [Kendra] Like a fork?

273
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:41,839
- Accept the next proposition you receive.

274
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,178
- [Jeremy] Uh-oh, will you marry me.

275
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:45,650
- Yes I will.

276
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,952
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

277
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:49,785
- Avoid unchallenging occupations,

278
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:53,398
they waste your talents.

279
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:57,565
- You and your spose will
be happy in life together.

280
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:00,590
- You and your spouse,
- You and your spouse

281
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,509
- [Jeremy] that's about
you and your wife someday.

282
00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:04,759
(laughing)

283
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,692
You'll be happy.

284
00:11:07,692 --> 00:11:10,918
- [Kendra] There you go, do
you want me to read it for you?

285
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:13,757
If given a penny for every kind act,

286
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:15,338
you'd be a millionaire.

287
00:11:15,338 --> 00:11:16,649
(laughing)

288
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:17,482
- Especially when you count back

289
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:19,519
when you were a little grandma.

290
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,217
- No kidding, that's when
it really starts adding up.

291
00:11:23,217 --> 00:11:25,358
- [Jeremy] She's thinking about that.

292
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:28,025
- Lady luck will soon visit you.

293
00:11:29,192 --> 00:11:31,259
- [Jeremy] Lady luck will soon visit you.

294
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:33,147
- That's supposed to be for a boy.

295
00:11:33,147 --> 00:11:35,991
- No, it means you're gonna be lucky.

296
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:36,824
- [Elise] Really?

297
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:38,150
- Yeah, something lucky's gonna happy.

298
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:40,310
- I wonder what's gonna happen?

299
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:41,695
- [Kendra] Something lucky.

300
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,997
Last one.

301
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:47,704
- You are extremely generous
and always thinking of others.

302
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:49,774
I have no response to that.

303
00:11:49,774 --> 00:11:50,607
- [Kendra] I agree, I agree.

304
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:53,524
- That was my cookie, give it back!

305
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,635
(lively music)

306
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,751
Some day they'll get
friends and get married,

307
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:03,647
and their friends and
family will tell them,

308
00:12:03,647 --> 00:12:07,397
that it's not normal to
dance in restaurants.

309
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:17,888
- Alright, we're gonna head to gymnastics

310
00:12:17,888 --> 00:12:18,721
and go to bed.

311
00:12:18,721 --> 00:12:19,554
Good night.

312
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:20,387
J House out.

313
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:22,399
- You know Harry at Hogwarts.

314
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,913
He talks in British.

315
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:25,662
(boing boing)

316
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,965
- Hi.

317
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:28,029
Say goodbye.

318
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,811
Parade of Homes.

319
00:12:29,811 --> 00:12:31,099
- What, what?

320
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:32,780
- [Kendra] What did you guys find?

321
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,917
- Get the door, Elise!

322
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,361
- Arms up.

323
00:12:35,361 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
