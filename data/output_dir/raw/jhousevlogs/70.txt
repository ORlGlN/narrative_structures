1
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,897
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae, what's
your New Year's resolution?

2
00:00:05,897 --> 00:00:07,882
(baby babbling)

3
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,714
- I think she wants to
learn to speak more words.

4
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:11,705
- [Jeremy] Maybe walk.

5
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:13,267
Can we go for potty train
or is that too early?

6
00:00:13,267 --> 00:00:15,917
- No, we're not gonna
go for potty training.

7
00:00:15,917 --> 00:00:17,192
- So my New Year's resolution

8
00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:19,942
is to limit fear's power over me.

9
00:00:21,254 --> 00:00:22,319
When I see opportunities

10
00:00:22,319 --> 00:00:24,613
or when I feel like I should do something,

11
00:00:24,613 --> 00:00:26,746
I don't want fear to be holding me back.

12
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:30,829
- I want to learn how to
change Nae Nae's diaper.

13
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:34,437
- [Jeremy] Oh, that's a great goal.

14
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:35,482
Caleb, did you accomplish

15
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:37,950
your New Year's resolution last year?

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,955
- Yeah.

17
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,922
I don't really remember it though.

18
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:43,062
- [Jeremy] Then how do
you know that you did it?

19
00:00:43,062 --> 00:00:43,895
- I don't know.

20
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,287
- [Jeremy] Did you keep
your New Year's resolution

21
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:46,561
from last year?

22
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:48,905
- I don't remember mine.

23
00:00:48,905 --> 00:00:51,184
- [Jeremy] What was your New
Year's resolution last year?

24
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,824
Oh, you weren't born yet, nevermind

25
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:53,950
- To be born.

26
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,235
To become a human.

27
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:56,200
- [Jeremy] You did it.

28
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,349
What's a talent you
wanna develop this year?

29
00:00:59,349 --> 00:01:02,682
- I'd like to learn this girl is on fire

30
00:01:05,096 --> 00:01:06,801
and practicing that song.

31
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:09,090
- [Jeremy] That's what
your goal is for this year?

32
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,018
What's a talent you
wanna develop this year?

33
00:01:11,018 --> 00:01:12,823
- Getting better at rollerskating.

34
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,108
- Rollerblade.

35
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,981
- To get better at skating.

36
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:17,759
- [Jeremy] Where's a place
you wanna go this year?

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,488
- Chick-Fil-A for a lunch.

38
00:01:20,488 --> 00:01:21,636
- [Jeremy] That's a good goal.

39
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:24,821
- Disney World, the
Magic Kingdom, Orlando.

40
00:01:24,821 --> 00:01:26,502
- I have been wanting to go to Hawaii.

41
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,404
- I want to go anywhere.

42
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:31,054
I love adventuring and
exploring with my family

43
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,243
and I don't know exactly
where I want to go this year,

44
00:01:33,243 --> 00:01:34,251
but I wanna go somewhere.

45
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:36,987
- [Jeremy] What do you
want to achieve this year?

46
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:39,106
- Do everything.

47
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,314
- [Jeremy] Do everything?

48
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:41,147
- Yes.

49
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:42,944
- Doing better hairstyles.

50
00:01:42,944 --> 00:01:45,426
- I think I would like
to feel more at peace.

51
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:47,859
I feel like so often I'm living in chaos,

52
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:48,927
and I can't keep up.

53
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:52,790
And I want to kind of let go
of some of those expectations

54
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,773
and embrace more of the chaos

55
00:01:54,773 --> 00:01:57,661
and hopefully feel more
peace in the midst of it.

56
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,136
I think I'm always trying to fix things

57
00:02:00,136 --> 00:02:01,612
so that I can feel peace.

58
00:02:01,612 --> 00:02:05,120
I would love to learn how to
have peace in the midst of it.

59
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,208
(baby babbling)

60
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,808
- [Jeremy] If you could have
one new experience this year,

61
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:11,225
what would it be?

62
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:15,315
- Going on a bigger rollercoaster.

63
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,401
- It can't be driving.

64
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:19,581
- [Jeremy] Not quite old enough to drive.

65
00:02:19,581 --> 00:02:21,363
- I want to try sushi.

66
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,295
I've never tried sushi and I kind of feel

67
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,725
like I'm not an adult because
I've never tried sushi,

68
00:02:25,725 --> 00:02:27,160
but I also don't know
if I wanna try it out

69
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,717
because raw fish sounds disgusting to me.

70
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,833
I can barely eat regular seafood

71
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:35,325
and so I just don't know
if I can do, but I want to.

72
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:37,617
'Cause I think I'll feel
like an actually grown-up

73
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,450
when I do.

74
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,143
- [Jeremy] What attribute do
you want to develop this year?

75
00:02:41,143 --> 00:02:43,634
It's like what about your
personality or character

76
00:02:43,634 --> 00:02:45,453
do you want to improve?

77
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:48,330
- I like Cinderella and everything.

78
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,175
I got the characters.

79
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,821
(Jeremy laughs)

80
00:02:51,821 --> 00:02:53,709
- [Jeremy] What attribute
or characteristic

81
00:02:53,709 --> 00:02:55,673
do you wanna develop better this year?

82
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:58,590
- Learning how to not react meanly.

83
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:03,189
- [Jeremy] Like try to
react with more kindness?

84
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,022
- Yeah.

85
00:03:04,022 --> 00:03:06,111
- Being nicer to my siblings.

86
00:03:06,111 --> 00:03:07,744
- [Jeremy] What attribute
or characteristic

87
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:09,368
are you working on this year?

88
00:03:09,368 --> 00:03:11,951
(baby babbles)

89
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,878
- I would love to cultivate
optimism this year.

90
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:17,926
Optimism with the big things in life

91
00:03:17,926 --> 00:03:18,984
and then the little things.

92
00:03:18,984 --> 00:03:22,078
Some day I wanna be known
as an optimistic person.

93
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,463
And right now, honestly,
my first reaction to things

94
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:26,893
is usually stress and worry and anxiety.

95
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:30,101
And everything in life so
far that I've experienced

96
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:31,622
always needs up working out.

97
00:03:31,622 --> 00:03:35,039
So I just want to practice more optimism.

98
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:38,779
Like you know, be a cheery person.

99
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:39,808
Oh, and gratitude.

100
00:03:39,808 --> 00:03:41,718
- [Jeremy] How many books
you wanna read this year?

101
00:03:41,718 --> 00:03:42,903
- About 15.

102
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,106
- [Jeremy] 15 books?

103
00:03:44,106 --> 00:03:45,489
- 14.

104
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:47,042
- 200 or something

105
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,968
'cause I wanna get really good at reading.

106
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:50,326
- About 200.

107
00:03:50,326 --> 00:03:52,182
- 12 to 24 books this year.

108
00:03:52,182 --> 00:03:53,953
Do you have any physical fitness

109
00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:55,775
or health related goals this year?

110
00:03:55,775 --> 00:03:57,642
- No, I don't think so.

111
00:03:57,642 --> 00:04:01,890
- I wanna eat more fruits
and veggies and get stronger.

112
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,274
- To get my hands stronger

113
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,725
with the stuff I got for Christmas.

114
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,751
- I would love to weigh 15 pounds less.

115
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,193
- I have been struggling
to exercise consistently

116
00:04:11,193 --> 00:04:14,058
and I love how I feel when I'm exercising.

117
00:04:14,058 --> 00:04:17,081
So I need to get on that and
the thing that's always helped

118
00:04:17,081 --> 00:04:19,113
with that is setting a goal with a race.

119
00:04:19,113 --> 00:04:20,961
So this summer I would like to do

120
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,563
either a half marathon or a triathlon.

121
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,514
Something that sets a goal for me

122
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,809
so that I can actually
get better at exercising

123
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:28,898
and just feel better.

124
00:04:28,898 --> 00:04:32,875
- [Jeremy] How do you decide
on a New Year's resolution?

125
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,246
- I don't know.

126
00:04:34,246 --> 00:04:37,995
- Just thinking of what
other people can do

127
00:04:37,995 --> 00:04:40,340
that I wanna get better at.

128
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,826
- If it'll help me in life.

129
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:43,951
- [Jeremy] How are you
gonna award yourself?

130
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,806
- What's award yourself?

131
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,272
- [Jeremy] Like what prize
are you gonna give yourself

132
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,402
or what present or treat are you gonna get

133
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:53,075
if you reach your goal?

134
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,544
- Candy.

135
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,974
- [Jeremy] What percentage
of people do you think

136
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,670
keep their New Year's resolutions?

137
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,078
- 60 people in the world.

138
00:05:01,078 --> 00:05:03,287
- [Jeremy] 60 total?

139
00:05:03,287 --> 00:05:05,404
What advice would you give
to people who are trying

140
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:08,503
to make and keep their
New Year's resolutions?

141
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:11,267
- Candy, or you can pray.

142
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:13,030
- You should keep working on them.

143
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,618
- Just try to remember what it was.

144
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:17,781
- Don't forget your resolution.

145
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,924
- Well here's the advice that
I'm trying to give to myself.

146
00:05:19,924 --> 00:05:22,674
I want to choose a specific goal.

147
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:26,805
Write it down, make it measurable

148
00:05:26,805 --> 00:05:29,133
so that I can actually make some progress.

149
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:30,215
- We would love to see in the comments

150
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:31,984
what your New Year's resolutions is.

151
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:33,193
- Well that's it for us today.

152
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:35,655
I hope you guys have had a wonderful 2017

153
00:05:35,655 --> 00:05:37,810
and we're looking forward to a great 2018

154
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,900
and sharing it with all of you.

155
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,183
- Thanks, J House out.

156
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:41,809
- Good night, J House out.

157
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:44,932
- [Kendra] Well Jenae
attracts a crowd, I think.

158
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:47,208
- [Elise] Are you ready to have fun?

159
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:48,284
- [Kendra] Is she smiling again?

160
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,784
Oh, there it goes.

161
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:51,902
Hi Jenae.

162
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,733
(laughs)

163
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,650
Aww, that looks so sad.

164
00:05:58,916 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughs)
