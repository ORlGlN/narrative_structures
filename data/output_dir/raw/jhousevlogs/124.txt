1
00:00:00,379 --> 00:00:01,624
- She's just fun, hi.

2
00:00:01,624 --> 00:00:02,574
(laughing)

3
00:00:02,574 --> 00:00:05,665
Caleb got kneed in almost his eye,

4
00:00:05,665 --> 00:00:07,033
it's already swelling up.

5
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:08,160
- [Elise] This is hard.

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,291
- [Kendra] My body hurts
just watching you guys.

7
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,913
- Pay me!

8
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:14,181
You owe us two dollars.

9
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,238
How's the cookie?

10
00:00:15,238 --> 00:00:16,071
- Good.

11
00:00:16,071 --> 00:00:18,654
(bright music)

12
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:22,073
- [Kendra] Elise tried a new
hairdo all by herself today.

13
00:00:22,073 --> 00:00:23,185
I think it looks so cute.

14
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:25,201
- And I put in a bobby pin all by myself.

15
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:26,034
- Time out.

16
00:00:26,034 --> 00:00:28,161
We found a way that
everyone can participate

17
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,871
in the upcoming Service Celebration.

18
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:31,804
So many of you have reached out

19
00:00:31,804 --> 00:00:32,876
and said you want to help,

20
00:00:32,876 --> 00:00:35,100
but you live far from Kansas City.

21
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,453
So we're gonna be assembling hygiene kits

22
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,120
for Puerto Rico, is right Laura?

23
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,195
We're gonna be doing
1800 of them, so 1,800.

24
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,563
Each kit is $10 dollars.

25
00:00:47,563 --> 00:00:49,514
And the way you can help, if you want,

26
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,367
is to help us with supporting funds.

27
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:52,922
Each kit is $10 dollars,

28
00:00:52,922 --> 00:00:57,257
so that's $18,000 dollars
that we're trying to raise.

29
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,217
No pressure though,

30
00:00:58,217 --> 00:00:59,050
if it's not something that you're able

31
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,143
to do, we understand.

32
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,399
We just wanted to give people a way

33
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,688
to participate, if they wanted to

34
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,144
and we appreciate any help you can give.

35
00:01:05,144 --> 00:01:07,602
There's a link in the description box

36
00:01:07,602 --> 00:01:08,794
and it goes to Heart to Heart,

37
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:11,578
they have a page specific
for our fundraiser,

38
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:13,227
of J House Vlogs and
we can reach that goal

39
00:01:13,227 --> 00:01:14,637
of $18,00 dollars.

40
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:15,917
Thank you so much.

41
00:01:15,917 --> 00:01:17,646
And we'll get you back
to the regular vlog.

42
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:18,646
Say time in.

43
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:20,343
- Time in.

44
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:24,141
- [Kendra] Nice, turn around let's see it.

45
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:27,613
- So yeah, I figured out a
new hairdo that I can do.

46
00:01:27,613 --> 00:01:28,730
- [Kendra] That's fun,
especially with short hair.

47
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,098
It's fun to have different
things to mix it up.

48
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:31,931
- Uh-huh.

49
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:34,461
Normally I just do a little
ponytail right there.

50
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:37,274
- [Kendra] The kids are
doing some morning stretches.

51
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:38,658
- I can go all the way down.

52
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:40,359
- [Kendra] These two have been
trying to get to the splits.

53
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,920
- I can.

54
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,869
- [Kendra] Almost.

55
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:44,803
- You want to see my splits?

56
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:46,411
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness, my body hurts

57
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:48,328
just watching you guys.

58
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,993
Oh my goodness.

59
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,367
Here's the poll question for the day.

60
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,263
Can you do the splits

61
00:01:54,263 --> 00:01:56,138
or did you used to be
able to do the splits?

62
00:01:56,138 --> 00:01:56,971
Let us know in the poll.

63
00:01:56,971 --> 00:01:59,301
Wow you guys be careful
with your bodies, okay?

64
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:02,380
But your pinky toe has to stay up.

65
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,115
- [Kendra] You are so close Caleb.

66
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:06,059
- Ready and up.

67
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:09,219
Feet together, make sure
your feet are together

68
00:02:09,219 --> 00:02:11,202
and your head is in touch with the ground.

69
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,858
- [Kendra] Knees together.

70
00:02:13,858 --> 00:02:15,701
Look at those bridges.

71
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,162
- I can't.

72
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:19,670
- [Kendra] Hey can you guys
all do downward dog with Janae?

73
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,684
- Downward dog everybody, push your toes

74
00:02:21,684 --> 00:02:24,893
and make sure your feet are together.

75
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:25,882
- Hey you.

76
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:28,730
So last night I had a terrible dream.

77
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,378
It was super scary

78
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:33,648
and anyway, I just kind
of woke up feeling nuh

79
00:02:33,648 --> 00:02:36,698
about life, like it's
hard when you're sleeping

80
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,299
and the whole time you're like scared

81
00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:40,074
and nervous and worried about stuff

82
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:42,181
and then you wake up
and it kind of affects

83
00:02:42,181 --> 00:02:43,370
how you feel about the day.

84
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,807
So I'm trying to get into a good mood.

85
00:02:45,807 --> 00:02:47,248
Working on it.

86
00:02:47,248 --> 00:02:49,544
- Now we're gonna do push ups.

87
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,711
One two three.

88
00:02:54,996 --> 00:02:55,829
- Four.
- 10.

89
00:02:55,829 --> 00:02:58,038
(Kendra laughing)

90
00:02:58,038 --> 00:02:59,160
- [Kendra] Caleb, whatcha working on?

91
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,784
- I'm working on a map of my room.

92
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:02,617
- There we go, we're making a map.

93
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:03,810
- How do you spell desk?

94
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,561
- [Kendra] How do you think?

95
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,561
- D-E-K-E?

96
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,174
- [Kendra] D-E-de-ssk.

97
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,371
- D-E-S-K-E.

98
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,344
- [Kendra] There's no E at the end.

99
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,397
D-E-S-K.

100
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:23,654
Good job, so is this
the key for your room?

101
00:03:23,654 --> 00:03:24,487
- Mmm-mmm.

102
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:25,879
- [Kendra] Elise, how's yours comin'?

103
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,146
- Pretty well.

104
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:29,689
- [Laura] Here's the
trampoline under water.

105
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:31,875
- [Kendra] That's our trampoline
in our house, good job.

106
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,713
- Come on, who wants to go

107
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,628
on a map adventure with me?

108
00:03:35,628 --> 00:03:37,931
(playful music)

109
00:03:37,931 --> 00:03:41,073
- So I come in, and then
is that the laundry?

110
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:41,906
- Huh?

111
00:03:41,906 --> 00:03:44,172
- Is that what that little
drawing of a shirt is?

112
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,005
Cool.

113
00:03:45,005 --> 00:03:46,297
- And then the trash can.

114
00:03:46,297 --> 00:03:48,073
- Right there.

115
00:03:48,073 --> 00:03:49,901
And then you have a dresser.

116
00:03:49,901 --> 00:03:51,322
Are these the windows?

117
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:52,155
- Yep.

118
00:03:52,155 --> 00:03:54,013
- [Kendra] So this is Caleb's
first map that he made.

119
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:56,605
And did it really work
to show where stuff was?

120
00:03:56,605 --> 00:03:59,314
Nope, so what did we have to do?

121
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:00,147
- Try again.

122
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:02,059
- Try again, and then did it work?

123
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:03,518
So the kids are having a
fun time making their maps

124
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:04,792
and then testing them out

125
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:05,625
and so we come into the room

126
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,561
and we try to follow their map

127
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,392
and see if everything's where it should be

128
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:09,696
and then they go and make revisions

129
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,232
and changes, and it's really been

130
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:13,301
a really fun activity for the morning.

131
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,309
Here's Elise's map to her room.

132
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:16,877
Where's the door?

133
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:17,709
- [Elise] Right there.

134
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:20,004
- [Kendra] Right there, good job.

135
00:04:20,005 --> 00:04:22,754
- So here's the hamper
and then my dresser,

136
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:25,193
my bed and curtains.

137
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:27,846
- Good job, Elise this looks amazing.

138
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,926
I love that you drew
the little night light.

139
00:04:29,926 --> 00:04:31,000
What did you think of drawing a map?

140
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,951
- It was pretty hard.

141
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:34,907
- [Kendra] Well you did awesome,
I'm really proud of you.

142
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,316
Okay we just need to make
the key to go with the map.

143
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:38,118
- Well it just helps me design.

144
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:40,222
- [Kendra] Ooh, do you
think you'd like design?

145
00:04:40,222 --> 00:04:41,797
- Yeah.

146
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:44,047
(laughing)

147
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:49,151
- [Kendra] You're just delightful.

148
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:52,386
Isn't she just fun, hey.

149
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,992
So Isaac and I have been struggling lately

150
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,180
that he's not as excited

151
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,083
about his writing assignments as I am.

152
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,315
So we decided to switch
things up a little bit

153
00:05:03,315 --> 00:05:05,034
and today for his writing assignment,

154
00:05:05,034 --> 00:05:07,237
he is writing an analytical article,

155
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:09,891
discussing the Kansas City Chiefs

156
00:05:09,891 --> 00:05:11,188
and the Oakland Raiders

157
00:05:11,188 --> 00:05:13,835
and that rivalry and digging into it

158
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,605
and he's really excited about it,

159
00:05:15,605 --> 00:05:16,451
and he's still writing,

160
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:18,281
which is what I wanted in the first place.

161
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:19,659
A little bit of a Chiefs fan?

162
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,267
- No, a big Chiefs fan.

163
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:23,150
- [Kendra] There we go.

164
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,104
Whatcha learning today?

165
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:25,083
- Rounding.

166
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:26,351
- [Kendra] Rounding, do you like it?

167
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:28,213
- Yep, its easier than I thought.

168
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,524
- [Kendra] Yeah.

169
00:05:29,524 --> 00:05:30,697
It also helps, she's been eating

170
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:34,801
some round candy, to
help her with rounding.

171
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,689
Mean Isaac, he won't let you eat things

172
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:38,594
off the floor.

173
00:05:38,594 --> 00:05:39,427
So today's one of those days

174
00:05:39,427 --> 00:05:42,575
that's just not going according to plans.

175
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,393
Jeremy's had just a bunch of stuff come up

176
00:05:44,393 --> 00:05:46,879
that was kind of frustrating
with some different work stuff,

177
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,112
and so he's been busy and preoccupied and

178
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:51,373
Oh Laura, stop.

179
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,581
That was Laura putting her hands in food.

180
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:56,336
Anyway, I feel like also
today's one of those days

181
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:58,138
where I just had these expectations

182
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,703
of things we were gonna be able to do

183
00:05:59,703 --> 00:06:01,823
and the day has just gotten away from me.

184
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:04,112
- So I've had kind of a grumpy day.

185
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:05,941
But I'm gonna play Monopoly
Jr now with the kids

186
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:08,148
and that makes everything better.

187
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:09,753
So Laura, you rolled this dice,

188
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,336
you're first to go.

189
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,393
Six!

190
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,006
Awesome, so we're going this way,

191
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:19,339
one two three four five six.

192
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:21,855
- You're just visiting.

193
00:06:21,855 --> 00:06:24,356
- [Jeremy] We're just
visiting in jail, perfect.

194
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:26,774
Alright Caleb you're up.

195
00:06:26,774 --> 00:06:27,749
- Three.

196
00:06:27,749 --> 00:06:28,582
- [Jeremy] Three,

197
00:06:28,582 --> 00:06:31,802
Ooh you got a chance card, yes.

198
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,219
I am hungry, that looks good.

199
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:39,496
- So the boys were having
a friendly wrestling match,

200
00:06:39,496 --> 00:06:40,976
which you know brothers do

201
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,712
and Caleb's face ended up getting

202
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:44,695
the bad end of that deal.

203
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:47,127
I'm so glad that didn't get your eye.

204
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:48,797
Buddy I'm so sorry.

205
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:50,925
Are you feeling okay?

206
00:06:50,925 --> 00:06:51,832
Yeah, let's keep some ice on it

207
00:06:51,832 --> 00:06:53,409
for a few more minutes, okay?

208
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,139
- It's too cold.

209
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,557
- [Kendra] Is the ice too cold?

210
00:06:56,557 --> 00:07:00,019
- I wish I could play Monopoly Jr.

211
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,519
(sweet music)

212
00:07:05,283 --> 00:07:06,588
- Well Isaac is reading to Caleb,

213
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,539
while Caleb sits and ices his face.

214
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,398
Caleb does not like to
put ice on his injuries.

215
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,458
He thinks it's too cold,

216
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:15,714
which I can understand it
is cold, ice is very cold.

217
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:16,878
- Let me see your eye.

218
00:07:16,878 --> 00:07:19,070
- Ooh he's gonna land on something.

219
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,649
Pay me!

220
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:22,191
You owe us two dollars.

221
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,006
- [Kendra] Laura, are you on Daddy's team?

222
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:25,399
What's your job?

223
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:27,303
- (yawning) To roll the dice.

224
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:28,758
(laughing)

225
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:30,706
- This game is so much fun.

226
00:07:30,706 --> 00:07:31,879
Maybe Lise will roll a one

227
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:34,248
and she'll owe us two dollars two.

228
00:07:34,248 --> 00:07:35,196
One!

229
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:36,829
Pay me two dollars.

230
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,866
- [Kendra] Is everybody going swimming?

231
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:43,147
So here's dinner, it's a
baked chili and cornbread.

232
00:07:43,147 --> 00:07:44,758
Yum.

233
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:46,513
- You owe him three dollars.

234
00:07:46,513 --> 00:07:48,330
- [Kendra] Isaac's at the pet store.

235
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,202
So what kind of pet did you decide to buy?

236
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:53,225
- A German shepherd or
a Labrador retriever.

237
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:54,406
- Nice.
- Ooh.

238
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,156
- One two three four.

239
00:07:58,261 --> 00:07:59,385
- Thank you guys.
- We owe you three dollars.

240
00:07:59,385 --> 00:08:02,103
- Caleb's pet store.
- Give three dollars to Cubby.

241
00:08:02,103 --> 00:08:03,048
- [Kendra] Hey Laura, what kind of a pet

242
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,200
are you gonna buy?

243
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,300
- A German shepherd.

244
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,225
(laughing)

245
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,812
- So Kendra showed the
kids a video this morning

246
00:08:07,812 --> 00:08:09,987
about German shepherd puppies,

247
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,228
and so they've all been
thinking about that.

248
00:08:12,228 --> 00:08:14,286
So Kendra had Famous Dave's corn bread

249
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,150
at a friend's house,

250
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,454
and she's been talking about it a lot,

251
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,694
so I'm glad we're gonna
finally get to try it.

252
00:08:19,694 --> 00:08:20,527
- [Kendra] It's so good.

253
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:21,360
- It smells good.

254
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,193
It smells more like cake.

255
00:08:22,193 --> 00:08:24,508
- [Kendra] Yeah exactly,
that's what makes it good.

256
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,080
There it is, should we
put some frosting on it?

257
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,454
- [Jeremy] Alright,
we're counting the money

258
00:08:27,454 --> 00:08:29,022
to see who has the most.

259
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:30,317
Alright, how much do you have Cub?

260
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:31,150
- I have 20.

261
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,881
- [Jeremy] How much do you have Laura.

262
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,131
30, 31, 32, 33.

263
00:08:36,297 --> 00:08:37,304
We won!

264
00:08:37,304 --> 00:08:38,136
- Yay!

265
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:39,905
- Me and Laura.

266
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:40,902
- [Kendra] The birthday boy's the winner.

267
00:08:40,903 --> 00:08:41,881
(laughing)

268
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:43,144
- Yeah.

269
00:08:43,144 --> 00:08:44,241
- Let's eat dinner.

270
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,584
This stuff is amazing.

271
00:08:45,584 --> 00:08:46,667
It's so good.

272
00:08:51,544 --> 00:08:52,377
- Puzzles.

273
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:53,346
- [Jeremy] Puzzles everywhere.

274
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:57,061
- Yeah, Laura really likes
pushing the pieces out,

275
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,509
she doesn't like putting
them back together so much.

276
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,604
So Caleb and Laura started the cookies,

277
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:02,199
but I definitely finished
making the cookies.

278
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,039
They needed some help,

279
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,191
and now we are going to
decorate them as a family.

280
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,024
- So we have some good friends

281
00:09:06,024 --> 00:09:07,999
that are going through a hard time

282
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,409
and wanted to take them
some of the cookies

283
00:09:09,409 --> 00:09:10,998
that we made tonight.

284
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:12,970
(bright music)

285
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,970
- Delicious.

286
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:19,946
- Ooh orange.

287
00:09:19,946 --> 00:09:21,277
This is hard.

288
00:09:21,277 --> 00:09:22,253
- Can you guys see the sprinkles?

289
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:23,086
- Yeah.

290
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:23,919
- What do they look like?

291
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,752
- [Isaac] Spiders.

292
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:26,335
- Spider sprinkles.

293
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:28,291
- Hi.

294
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,949
- Hi, we have spider sprinkles.

295
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:33,199
(laughing)

296
00:09:41,012 --> 00:09:41,845
- I got some on me.

297
00:09:41,845 --> 00:09:42,678
- [Jeremy] Whoopsadaisies.

298
00:09:42,678 --> 00:09:45,274
- We might have to keep all
the cookies she decorates.

299
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:47,279
- [Jeremy] It's like a jack-o-lantern.

300
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,341
- [Kendra] There's a little ghost.

301
00:09:49,341 --> 00:09:51,122
Laura's going for the modern art.

302
00:09:51,122 --> 00:09:52,695
- [Jeremy] Picasso.

303
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,655
- Please can you get me.

304
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:56,085
- You're actually doing a really good job.

305
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:58,948
What do you think, is that good?

306
00:09:58,948 --> 00:10:00,517
Laura that turned out so cute.

307
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,646
Are you gonna eat it?

308
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,584
- [Laura] I'm gonna give
this one away to a neighbor.

309
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:06,229
- Okay, so this one's for the neighbor.

310
00:10:06,229 --> 00:10:07,586
And that one's for you?

311
00:10:07,586 --> 00:10:08,419
Awesome.

312
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,204
- [Jeremy] How's the cookie?

313
00:10:17,204 --> 00:10:18,501
- Good.

314
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:21,449
- [Kendra] Okay I think all of
these turned out really fun,

315
00:10:21,449 --> 00:10:24,408
but my favorite one is Jeremy's,

316
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:25,649
especially because he put it down talking

317
00:10:25,649 --> 00:10:27,166
in a nice little pirate voice.

318
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,841
I was also excited that
we found some eyeballs.

319
00:10:29,841 --> 00:10:32,591
Elise made a pumpkin smiley face.

320
00:10:37,615 --> 00:10:39,848
Janae can you say good night?

321
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,186
Say J House out.

322
00:10:41,186 --> 00:10:42,458
Goodnight, J House out.

323
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,426
(lively music)

324
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,357
- Quiet.

325
00:10:44,357 --> 00:10:45,811
(golf stroke)

326
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,311
- Uh I got it, ah.

327
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,191
Whoa.

328
00:10:50,191 --> 00:00:00,000
Socks!
