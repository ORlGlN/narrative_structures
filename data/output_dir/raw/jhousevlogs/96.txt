1
00:00:00,234 --> 00:00:02,708
- [Jeremy] I weigh 189 pounds.

2
00:00:02,708 --> 00:00:05,296
- That's a lot, that could break a house.

3
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:08,985
(uptempo dance music)

4
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:11,205
(yelling)

5
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:12,038
- Look at her.

6
00:00:12,038 --> 00:00:14,388
- [Jeremy] She's lovin' it.

7
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:15,221
Come back.

8
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:16,472
(laughing)

9
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,120
Oh wrong end.

10
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,787
(uptempo music)

11
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:24,996
(gentle music)

12
00:00:25,903 --> 00:00:27,317
- Well I'm spending some time alone out

13
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:28,333
on the lake this morning,

14
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:32,128
and it is beautiful, just breathtaking.

15
00:00:32,128 --> 00:00:35,346
I'm loving this chance to
just think and daydream

16
00:00:35,346 --> 00:00:37,144
and kind of clear my head for a minute.

17
00:00:37,144 --> 00:00:39,438
There's something about
being out in nature

18
00:00:39,438 --> 00:00:41,075
that is profound, even if it's cold out

19
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,439
and I'm really wishing I had gloves,

20
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,886
because my hands are going numb.

21
00:00:43,886 --> 00:00:46,477
And I just came across
a house that's for sale,

22
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:47,388
right up against the lake.

23
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:49,033
Check out this beautifulness.

24
00:00:49,033 --> 00:00:50,528
What do you think?

25
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,345
I think that's beautiful.

26
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:55,064
- Alright, hop on in bud.

27
00:00:55,064 --> 00:00:56,891
- [Kendra] Isaac's becoming a pro.

28
00:00:56,891 --> 00:00:57,724
- Be gone.

29
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,978
(water lapping)

30
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,561
(lively music)

31
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:06,052
Rowing speed.

32
00:01:10,312 --> 00:01:11,648
- Well the sun is out today,

33
00:01:11,648 --> 00:01:14,006
but it is colder and windier.

34
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,034
- [Jeremy] We haven't seen the
sun on the water very much.

35
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:18,954
Laura's going out (laughs).

36
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,937
Laura look, you're doing it.

37
00:01:20,937 --> 00:01:22,049
- She really wanted to go,

38
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,036
and now she's a little nervous.

39
00:01:24,036 --> 00:01:26,703
(playful music)

40
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,713
(laughing)

41
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:33,732
- [Jeremy] I weight 189 pounds.

42
00:01:33,732 --> 00:01:36,686
- That's a lot, that could break a house.

43
00:01:36,686 --> 00:01:39,226
- Yeah, it could probably break a house.

44
00:01:39,226 --> 00:01:40,278
That's the response.

45
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:42,257
I'm trying to lose some okay?

46
00:01:42,257 --> 00:01:44,757
(jazzy music)

47
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:51,305
Laura, we're at the swimming pool.

48
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:52,138
Come on.

49
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:55,347
- So while Jeremy and
the guys have the kids

50
00:01:55,347 --> 00:01:57,497
at the pool, we are taking care

51
00:01:57,497 --> 00:01:59,985
of the little girls,
who are mostly napping,

52
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:01,858
which means that we're having girl time.

53
00:02:01,858 --> 00:02:05,043
We are watching a movie
and eating some cookies

54
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:07,098
and just hanging out and
laughing and chatting.

55
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:08,681
It's awesome.

56
00:02:08,681 --> 00:02:09,724
(lively music)

57
00:02:09,725 --> 00:02:10,558
(Janae cooing)

58
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:11,391
Hi.

59
00:02:12,515 --> 00:02:13,348
Hi.

60
00:02:14,596 --> 00:02:15,429
(Janae cooing)

61
00:02:15,429 --> 00:02:16,262
Hi.

62
00:02:17,854 --> 00:02:20,437
(bright music)

63
00:02:30,409 --> 00:02:32,977
- Well I've always wanted to try this.

64
00:02:32,977 --> 00:02:33,897
And they have it here.

65
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:35,344
We had no idea.

66
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:37,001
Everyone's watching.

67
00:02:37,001 --> 00:02:39,668
(water gushing)

68
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:42,629
♪ Lift off ♪

69
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,863
Whoa.

70
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,780
(funky beat music)

71
00:02:48,143 --> 00:02:50,393
(laughing)

72
00:03:01,717 --> 00:03:03,967
(laughing)

73
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:13,973
So I just tried the wave rider thing,

74
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:15,757
and Isaac and Elise want to try it.

75
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:16,652
- I'm excited.

76
00:03:16,652 --> 00:03:18,510
- [Jeremy] Elise, are you nervous at all?

77
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,829
- Um kinda.
(gentle music)

78
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,847
- I'm like just at the height

79
00:03:21,847 --> 00:03:24,602
to be able to stand up and do it.

80
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:27,269
(water gushing)

81
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:32,221
- [Jeremy] Try to get on your knees.

82
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:33,221
Yeah!
- Yeah!

83
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:37,542
- [Jeremy] Good job bud, oh!

84
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:39,497
(Jeremy laughing)

85
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:40,914
You got it Elise.

86
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:43,027
Good job!

87
00:03:46,864 --> 00:03:48,614
You're doing awesome!

88
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:52,495
(Jeremy laughs)

89
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:55,162
(uptempo music)

90
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,487
(splashing)

91
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,428
(water gushing)

92
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:25,123
That is so much fun.

93
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:26,836
We got the ping-pong table set up.

94
00:04:26,836 --> 00:04:27,714
(girls screaming)

95
00:04:27,714 --> 00:04:31,131
(uptempo drumming music)

96
00:04:43,027 --> 00:04:44,080
- Ah.

97
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,238
- Ah.
- Hi.

98
00:04:45,238 --> 00:04:46,364
- Ah.

99
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:48,070
- [Jeremy] Hi.

100
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,161
- Gimme five.

101
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:49,994
(punch)

102
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:50,827
Yeah.

103
00:04:50,827 --> 00:04:52,178
- [Jeremy] She did it, she gave it.

104
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:53,011
- [Michael] She was going for it.

105
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,902
- So Michael has some sweet cameras.

106
00:04:54,902 --> 00:04:56,542
And he's doing an impromptu photo shoot

107
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:57,606
that everyone requested.

108
00:04:57,606 --> 00:04:58,869
- Totally planned this out,

109
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,109
scouted the location.

110
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:00,942
(playful music)

111
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:03,176
- Get together, look together.

112
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:04,426
- [Michael] Okay everyone look at me

113
00:05:04,426 --> 00:05:06,042
and think about
marshmallows and ice cream.

114
00:05:06,042 --> 00:05:08,209
(yelling)

115
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,021
- Woo!

116
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:16,739
(gentle music)

117
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,406
But we need Melanie.

118
00:05:20,798 --> 00:05:23,182
- [Jeremy] They're getting
a picture of the family.

119
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:25,508
- [Michael] Okay one two three.

120
00:05:25,508 --> 00:05:26,503
- Wait.

121
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:27,746
- My smile's messed up.

122
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:29,271
- Get your face in.

123
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,897
One two three.

124
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,730
- Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey.

125
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,566
- Well we made dinner,

126
00:05:35,566 --> 00:05:38,327
which is a special leftover
Thanksgiving dinner casserole,

127
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,801
that I absolutely love,

128
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:40,756
and now my mom is whipping up

129
00:05:40,756 --> 00:05:42,740
some brown sugar cookie dough,

130
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,883
so we can roll out sugar
cookies with the kids.

131
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,655
- And we have matching
pajamas coming soon.

132
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,106
- Yes, so we're very excited,

133
00:05:48,106 --> 00:05:50,812
there's Christmas PJs on the way.

134
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,801
The turkey's on the bottom.

135
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,001
(bright music)

136
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:56,630
It's so yummy Caleb, I love this meal.

137
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,239
It's called Thanksgiving
leftover casserole.

138
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,366
Here it is.

139
00:06:01,366 --> 00:06:03,448
So it's got stuffing,
gravy, mashed potatoes,

140
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,930
turkey, all together.

141
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,724
- So Mugga has a surprise
for all the grandkids.

142
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:09,652
- We don't very often get to be together

143
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,491
at the holidays, okay?

144
00:06:11,491 --> 00:06:14,992
And so Grandma decided to
do something really silly.

145
00:06:14,992 --> 00:06:17,247
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy")

146
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,080
- What is that?

147
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,913
Stand up.

148
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:19,811
(Elise gasps)

149
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:21,727
- Matching footy pajamas.

150
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:22,610
- [Jeremy] Yep.

151
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,985
- Are we going to Christmas together?

152
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,239
(laughing)

153
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:28,814
- And all the other big kids are gonna

154
00:06:28,814 --> 00:06:30,806
be wearing these.

155
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:33,032
- [Jeremy] This is awesome.

156
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:34,918
- So you guys are gonna get to,

157
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,209
I'll give you the one that's for you,

158
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,789
and then you need to go and put 'em on

159
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,789
and we're gonna have a picture.

160
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:42,600
(enchanting music)

161
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,485
- [Kendra] What did you get?

162
00:06:44,485 --> 00:06:45,433
What is it?

163
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:46,266
(gasps)

164
00:06:46,266 --> 00:06:47,099
Those are so cute.

165
00:06:47,099 --> 00:06:48,937
Are those Christmas jammies?

166
00:06:48,937 --> 00:06:49,888
- [Jeremy] Go put 'em on.

167
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:50,888
What do you think?

168
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:52,552
- I like it.

169
00:06:52,552 --> 00:06:54,156
- [Kendra] Look, you and Lily match.

170
00:06:54,156 --> 00:06:55,410
Look guys.

171
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,910
- This is amazing!

172
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,603
- Caleb and Isaac, can you

173
00:07:00,603 --> 00:07:02,242
- [Jared] Well Lily's
coming in too somewhere.

174
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,407
- Sarah, so

175
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,864
- Ya'll gotta squish in.

176
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:06,177
Oh my goodness.

177
00:07:06,177 --> 00:07:08,248
- Okay, start taking pictures.

178
00:07:08,248 --> 00:07:09,178
- [Baby] Mommy!

179
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,219
(baby crying)

180
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:12,710
- It's part of the luster, guys.

181
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,774
- [Kendra] Can everybody look
at me and do a silly face?

182
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,737
- [Jeremy] Silly face!

183
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,887
- Got it.

184
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:19,853
So our family's never
done the whole Christmas

185
00:07:19,853 --> 00:07:21,134
matching pajamas thing,

186
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:22,600
but I saw a video a few years ago

187
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,433
