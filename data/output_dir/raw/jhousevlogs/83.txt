1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:01,803
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,803 --> 00:00:03,452
- [Jeremy] This is gonna end bad.

3
00:00:03,452 --> 00:00:05,702
- Laura made me a necklace.

4
00:00:06,613 --> 00:00:09,335
- [Jeremy] Lise's cartwheel.

5
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:11,349
- I forgot my uh, shoes.

6
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,443
- Shoes, 'kay?

7
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:13,276
No shoes.

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:22,898
So I was looking at this
amazing sunset this morning

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:26,104
and saw this rocket shoot into the sky.

10
00:00:26,104 --> 00:00:29,548
We live in such an amazing time.

11
00:00:29,548 --> 00:00:32,215
And I get to go play racketball.

12
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:36,933
("I Saw Three Ships")

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,578
- We're missing Joseph.

14
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:43,733
- [Jeremy] Where do you think he is?

15
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:45,802
- Well Laura took it in her room.

16
00:00:45,802 --> 00:00:47,019
- [Jeremy] I like your new jacket.

17
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:47,852
- Thanks.

18
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:49,350
It's basically a vest.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,598
- [Jeremy] It's cute.

20
00:00:50,598 --> 00:00:51,680
- Thanks.

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,500
- Well I'm at the grocery store, again.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,782
And it's just funny.

23
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:56,863
There's some weeks when
I'm super organized

24
00:00:56,863 --> 00:00:59,704
and I meal plan and I online grocery shop.

25
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:02,356
And there's other weeks
when I am not that organized

26
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:03,737
and I have no idea what
we're having for dinner,

27
00:01:03,737 --> 00:01:04,864
even though it's right before dinner time.

28
00:01:04,864 --> 00:01:06,626
And those are the weeks when I find myself

29
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:08,800
at the grocery store over
and over and over again.

30
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,050
So, it happens.

31
00:01:11,014 --> 00:01:11,987
I have a super fun craft

32
00:01:11,987 --> 00:01:14,369
that I want to do with the kids
tomorrow that includes food.

33
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,601
And especially lots of fruit.

34
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,872
So I'm having fun buying
all the yummy stuff.

35
00:01:17,872 --> 00:01:20,455
(bright music)

36
00:01:32,701 --> 00:01:35,119
(Janae babbles)

37
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,190
- [Jeremy] Here we go little ma'am.

38
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,357
- [Elise] Umm.

39
00:01:43,366 --> 00:01:47,033
(Janae and Jeremy babbling)

40
00:01:50,852 --> 00:01:53,602
("Silent Night")

41
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,001
- And one, two, ready go.

42
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:02,084
("Joy to the World")

43
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:06,960
Keep going.

44
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:17,340
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae, you dancing?

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,265
There she's going.

46
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:20,598
You dancing too?

47
00:02:21,783 --> 00:02:22,731
Nice.

48
00:02:22,731 --> 00:02:23,564
Yeah!

49
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,562
Oh!

50
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,929
Yeah!

51
00:02:27,929 --> 00:02:30,345
Nae Nae's dancing brings
us so much happiness.

52
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:34,069
(singing in foreign language)

53
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,736
You are so adorable.

54
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,828
- I think your name could be Granny Kay.

55
00:02:39,828 --> 00:02:41,161
- [Kendra] Like how you got Granny Jo?

56
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,667
- Um hmm.
- I could be Granny Kay?

57
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,303
- What about Mommy Kay?

58
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:46,342
- Mommy Kay?
- But you have a mom.

59
00:02:46,342 --> 00:02:48,421
- Okay, so in the comments, I wanna hear

60
00:02:48,421 --> 00:02:50,286
what do you call your grandparents?

61
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,339
I grew up pretty traditional.

62
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:52,465
We had Grandma and Grandpa

63
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:54,012
and Grandmom and Grandad.

64
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:56,652
Our kids call their grandparents
lots of different names.

65
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,248
They've got Granny Jo, Poppy Rod,

66
00:02:58,248 --> 00:03:00,414
they've got Grandma, Mugga, Poppa.

67
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:01,778
So there's lots of names out there.

68
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:03,964
I think it'd be fun to have
a cute little pet name.

69
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:05,103
I'm gonna have to think about this.

70
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,053
But luckily I've got some serious time.

71
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:08,780
The favorite grandparent
name that I've ever heard

72
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,197
is Mema and Pepa.

73
00:03:11,326 --> 00:03:12,828
That would just be really funny.

74
00:03:12,828 --> 00:03:15,556
Like oh Mema and Pepa are coming over.

75
00:03:15,556 --> 00:03:19,723
- [Jeremy] So Nae Nae is
starting to open cupboards.

76
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:23,261
And it is gonna be a problem.

77
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,236
Look, this is the puzzle drawer.

78
00:03:27,236 --> 00:03:29,266
Look, do you see all the puzzles in there?

79
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:30,146
- [Laura] See the puzzle?

80
00:03:30,146 --> 00:03:32,333
(Janae babbles)

81
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:34,380
- We're trying to rememorize everything.

82
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,088
- Let's go to the next one.

83
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,302
- These two are spending
more and more time

84
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,714
looking at sports stats, analyzing them

85
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:42,548
and talking about it.

86
00:03:42,548 --> 00:03:43,686
It's pretty fun.

87
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:46,531
- In between yours I think,
Cameron Jordan my favorite that.

88
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:48,127
You're only by Barrett.

89
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,538
- Do you like my earrings?

90
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:53,993
And my necklace and my barrette?

91
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:56,109
I got from this toy.

92
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:57,271
- [Jeremy] It's a pretty cool toy.

93
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,061
- You can build earrings with it.

94
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,034
- [Jeremy] Can you make me some jewelry?

95
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,951
- Well, you're too big.

96
00:04:05,424 --> 00:04:08,483
I'm getting my bracelets on.

97
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:11,145
(bright music)

98
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:12,312
My sleeves up.

99
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,107
I look pretty.

100
00:04:16,107 --> 00:04:17,440
- [Jeremy] So pretty.

101
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,037
- [Kendra] What are you guys working on?

102
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:20,846
- We're making it long.

103
00:04:20,846 --> 00:04:23,766
- Really longest.
- Super long.

104
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:25,349
- Super duper long.

105
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:28,156
- [Kendra] How are you gonna make it long?

106
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:31,406
- From getting all of those, the beads.

107
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:33,298
- [Kendra] Whoa?

108
00:04:33,298 --> 00:04:34,323
- Look how big it is?

109
00:04:34,323 --> 00:04:36,288
It's bigger than me,

110
00:04:36,288 --> 00:04:39,301
almost bigger than me standing already.

111
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,947
Putting it up right here.

112
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:44,352
- [Kendra] Whoa, it is
already bigger than you.

113
00:04:44,352 --> 00:04:46,213
- Get it bigger than you.

114
00:04:46,213 --> 00:04:47,601
- Than me?
- Yeah.

115
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:48,434
- 'Kay, good luck.

116
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:49,267
Keep building.

117
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,365
- This is where we are.

118
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:52,674
- [Kendra] Yep, that's where we are.

119
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:53,847
Laura, what does this say?

120
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,290
Where do we live?

121
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,193
- I don't know.

122
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:57,064
- [Kendra] You don't know?

123
00:04:57,064 --> 00:04:59,484
- [Caleb] The United States of America.

124
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:00,835
- Yep, that's where we live.

125
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,455
So Caleb, do you remember Brazil?

126
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,872
That's where the last Olympics was held.

127
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:07,028
So a friend of mine recently
was getting rid of this.

128
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,844
It's just a piece of fabric, but it's map.

129
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:11,033
And I thought it'd be so cool
to have a map that's large

130
00:05:11,033 --> 00:05:13,028
and that I can just lay out on the ground

131
00:05:13,028 --> 00:05:14,199
and we can look at stuff.

132
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,860
So I'm excited to use it.

133
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,448
Laura made me a necklace
and some earrings.

134
00:05:19,448 --> 00:05:20,281
- Um hmm.

135
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:21,114
- [Jeremy] She wouldn't make me any,

136
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:22,000
she said I was too big.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,159
- Aw. (laughs)

138
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:24,211
She said you were too big?

139
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:25,542
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

140
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:26,722
I got a pretty necklace though.

141
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:28,221
You look so nice.

142
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:29,312
- Thank you.

143
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,979
And I brought her some earrings.

144
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:35,170
- You did, you made me earrings.

145
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,615
Do you wanna put something on 'em?

146
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,282
- Sure, I'll get it.

147
00:05:39,275 --> 00:05:40,444
- [Jeremy] Right there.

148
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:41,968
- Is it hurting?
- In that spot.

149
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:45,302
She's trying to put it like
all the way on to the inner.

150
00:05:45,302 --> 00:05:46,921
- [Kendra] Okay, put the jewel on.

151
00:05:46,921 --> 00:05:48,181
There we go.

152
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,681
'Kay, then Mommy'll put it on.

153
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:53,971
- [Jeremy] Fancy.

154
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,426
- So Elise and I are working
on the outline for her story.

155
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:58,245
Do you remember what it's called?

156
00:05:58,245 --> 00:06:00,056
- The Christmas Duck.

157
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:02,637
- Isaac is typing up the
first draft of his book.

158
00:06:02,637 --> 00:06:04,393
- [Jeremy] So how many
words do you have so far?

159
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:05,971
- 281.

160
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:07,125
- [Jeremy] Keep up the good work.

161
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,570
- Yeah.
- So I taped it

162
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,516
so that nobody can get into it.

163
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:14,375
- [Jeremy] But we need
to put the toy back in.

164
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,483
We need to get it all cleaned up.

165
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:17,726
- Okay, then you guys
can take off the tape.

166
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:19,048
- Do you think you can rip it off?

167
00:06:19,048 --> 00:06:20,522
Parenting tip.

168
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:23,608
Tape does not come off of tables
as easy as you would think.

169
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:26,020
(playful music)

170
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,859
(Kendra laughs)

171
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:30,192
Just don't cut yourself man.

172
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:40,439
Laura's obsessed with tape right now.

173
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,536
I don't know how she gets ahold of it.

174
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,759
Like we put it up, we hide it places.

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,215
And then boom.

176
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,632
Tape, everywhere.

177
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:50,618
Sometimes you just can't get it off.

178
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,465
Problem is, is she
can't get it off either.

179
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:55,015
So it's always Laura,
- I take it off.

180
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:56,899
- you have to clean it up.

181
00:06:56,899 --> 00:06:58,505
She can't do it.

182
00:06:58,505 --> 00:06:59,788
Did you get it?

183
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:00,621
Yeah, no.

184
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:02,867
- [Laura] No, I can't.

185
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,639
(Isaac laughs)

186
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,389
- [Jeremy] Good save.

187
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,018
This is fun.

188
00:07:12,018 --> 00:07:14,206
- [Elise] And then I land like this.

189
00:07:14,206 --> 00:07:15,167
- [Jeremy] Is that the end?

190
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:16,375
- Um hmm.

191
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,165
- [Laura] My show is so long.

192
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:20,726
(playful music)

193
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:22,342
- [Jeremy] So what are you guys doing?

194
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:25,313
- We're seeing who can go the longest.

195
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:27,658
- Be careful.
- But it has to be going fast.

196
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:30,072
- [Jeremy] This is gonna end bad.

197
00:07:30,072 --> 00:07:34,636
Oh my, okay now, everyone
try to walk straight.

198
00:07:34,636 --> 00:07:36,886
(laughing)

199
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,967
It worked pretty good.

200
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,244
How does it feel?

201
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:42,711
(laughing)

202
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:46,711
Nae Nae's just like walking
along the wall here.

203
00:07:50,308 --> 00:07:51,717
(laughing)

204
00:07:51,717 --> 00:07:52,634
Be careful.

205
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,988
- We're gonna play basketball.

206
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,139
- [Jeremy] Yeah, we are.

207
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:58,992
- That's weird.

208
00:07:58,992 --> 00:08:01,554
It used to be over here.

209
00:08:01,554 --> 00:08:04,482
- It's been crazy windy
here the last couple days.

210
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:06,251
And it blew over the basketball hoop.

211
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,751
(happy music)

212
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:15,931
Hey!

213
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,659
Hello.

214
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:19,774
It's getting pretty dark out there guys.

215
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:23,691
We have to get ready for
gymnastics soon, okay?

216
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:27,395
Oh, you're out Isaac!

217
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:28,829
Parenting fail moment.

218
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:31,703
We just drove here to
gymnastics and Laura announces

219
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:32,761
once we get here:

220
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,144
- I forgot my um, shoes.

221
00:08:35,145 --> 00:08:36,168
- Shoe, 'kay?

222
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:38,246
No shoes and we're here.

223
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:41,226
So I'm gonna carry her
into gymnastics now.

224
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:42,363
Alright, let's go.

225
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,946
(upbeat music)

226
00:08:49,176 --> 00:08:50,252
How was gymnastics?

227
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:51,085
- Good.

228
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:54,689
I learned tuck jumps.
- Tuck jumps.

229
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:57,264
- Yeah.
- You got a sucker though.

230
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:59,374
You getting sticky everywhere?

231
00:08:59,374 --> 00:09:00,619
- No.

232
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:01,959
I just got water.

233
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,401
So Elise is showing us some of the things

234
00:09:03,401 --> 00:09:05,320
she's been learning in gymnastics.

235
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,416
- [Kendra] She's been working hard.

236
00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:07,798
- Whoa.
- What?

237
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,757
- And then watch what
I can do with my split.

238
00:09:10,757 --> 00:09:12,542
- [Kendra] Whoa, very good!

239
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,165
Hey, show us your cartwheel.

240
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,241
- [Jeremy] Lise's cartwheel.

241
00:09:16,241 --> 00:09:17,631
(Kendra cheering)
Good job big girl.

242
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:19,410
You have made so much progress.

243
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,243
- Uh huh.

244
00:09:20,243 --> 00:09:21,243
- [Jeremy] So proud of you.

245
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:22,180
- My turn.

246
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,214
- [Jeremy] We're really proud of you.

247
00:09:25,214 --> 00:09:26,618
(Kendra cheers)
Round off.

248
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:27,656
How was violin?

249
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:28,489
- Good.

250
00:09:28,489 --> 00:09:29,903
Goodnight, J House out.

251
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:33,597
♪ The is the best rolini ever ♪

252
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:36,293
- That is beautiful Mom.

253
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:38,256
- [Elise] How did you do it?

254
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:39,937
- It's like stars.

255
00:09:39,937 --> 00:09:42,463
- I'm on a kind of emotional
roller coaster right now.

256
00:09:42,463 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
