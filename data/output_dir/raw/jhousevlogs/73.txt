1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:02,605
- Is it a hint 'cause of my bad breath?

2
00:00:02,605 --> 00:00:03,886
- Yeah.

3
00:00:03,886 --> 00:00:05,149
(all laughing)

4
00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:06,594
- Whoa!
- Double.

5
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:07,844
Different wrap.

6
00:00:09,638 --> 00:00:11,206
She wants.

7
00:00:11,206 --> 00:00:12,621
- Dad, here you go.
- Yes.

8
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:13,851
This is too embarrassing.

9
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:16,434
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:19,036
- We're really excited

11
00:00:19,036 --> 00:00:21,077
because it's time for our
favorite holiday tradition,

12
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:22,851
which is the kids' gift exchange.

13
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:24,217
If you missed it in our other videos,

14
00:00:24,217 --> 00:00:26,011
the kids worked hard and earned some money

15
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,167
and then we took 'em to the store

16
00:00:27,167 --> 00:00:28,830
and they got to shop for each other.

17
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,050
And so now they're giving the
gifts that they worked for

18
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,402
and got for each other and
it's always really sweet.

19
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:35,245
- Alright, Laura's up first.

20
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:36,394
Who's this one for?

21
00:00:36,394 --> 00:00:38,208
- Caleb.
- Go give it to him.

22
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:39,680
- [Kendra] Pass 'em out.

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,981
- Laura I like it, it's huge.

24
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:42,997
- To Nae Nae.

25
00:00:42,997 --> 00:00:43,830
There you go.

26
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,494
Yours is really little.

27
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:46,517
- That's okay.

28
00:00:46,517 --> 00:00:47,676
I bet I'm gonna like it.

29
00:00:47,676 --> 00:00:48,509
- Yeah.

30
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:50,075
- [Kendra] Janae's coming
after yours Jeremy.

31
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:51,557
- You want mine?
- She wants it.

32
00:00:51,557 --> 00:00:53,095
- Is this one Lise's?

33
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,399
- [Kendra] Let's see, let's read the tag

34
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:55,566
and it'll tell us.

35
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,889
To Mom from Laura.

36
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:58,054
So that one's for me.

37
00:00:58,054 --> 00:00:59,046
'Kay.
- There it is.

38
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:00,590
- [Kendra] Take it to Lise.

39
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,601
- Thank you.

40
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:03,676
- You will not know what it is.

41
00:01:03,676 --> 00:01:06,423
- I do not know what it is.

42
00:01:06,423 --> 00:01:10,256
- It's really shaped
like nail polish I think.

43
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:13,201
- [Kendra] Uh oh. (laughs)

44
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:14,734
It's shaped like nail polish.

45
00:01:14,734 --> 00:01:17,442
- Oh.
- But it's not nail polish.

46
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:19,123
It's, we stick it on--

47
00:01:19,123 --> 00:01:20,116
- [Kendra] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

48
00:01:20,116 --> 00:01:21,515
Shhhh!
- Don't tell her.

49
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,348
- [Kendra] Don't tell her.

50
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,913
- I didn't tell her what color.

51
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:25,810
- [Kendra] Okay. (laughs)

52
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:27,197
- [Jeremy] Let's just have
Elise open hers since we

53
00:01:27,197 --> 00:01:30,197
might have a guess as to what it is.

54
00:01:31,378 --> 00:01:34,203
- (gasps) This is beautiful.

55
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,391
So you stick them on your fingers?

56
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:37,890
- Yeah.
- Fake nails.

57
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,104
- I've wanted these,

58
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:42,793
like I wanted to put them on my fingers.

59
00:01:42,793 --> 00:01:44,130
Thank you Laura.

60
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,973
- You're welcome.

61
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:46,385
- It's a really good gift.

62
00:01:46,385 --> 00:01:48,149
It's like springy.

63
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,508
- They're beautiful.

64
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:51,513
So I love that Laura
helped wrapped her presents

65
00:01:51,513 --> 00:01:52,922
and she even wrote her name.

66
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:55,922
L-A-U-R and another A.

67
00:01:56,884 --> 00:01:57,798
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

68
00:01:57,798 --> 00:01:58,791
- Here Nae Nae, you ready?

69
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,968
- [Jeremy] I found one already.

70
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,123
I'm good.

71
00:02:01,123 --> 00:02:02,924
That one's for you.

72
00:02:02,924 --> 00:02:04,641
(Janae babbles)

73
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:05,891
- There you go.

74
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:10,402
(Laura gasps)
There you go.

75
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,537
- A baby book.

76
00:02:11,537 --> 00:02:12,828
- What's in there?

77
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:13,828
It's a baby.

78
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:18,040
- She really.
- She likes it.

79
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,115
- She likes it very much.
- She does.

80
00:02:21,115 --> 00:02:23,115
- [Jeremy] Caleb's turn.

81
00:02:24,953 --> 00:02:26,255
- A golf thing?

82
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:27,088
- Yep.

83
00:02:27,088 --> 00:02:28,619
It's for two of us.

84
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,427
We can play together.

85
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:31,494
- Thank you.

86
00:02:31,494 --> 00:02:32,911
- You're welcome.

87
00:02:34,114 --> 00:02:35,628
Do you know what is it?

88
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:37,122
- You've told me like 10 times.

89
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,352
(Jeremy and Isaac laughing)

90
00:02:39,352 --> 00:02:41,923
- But you don't know this time.

91
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:43,075
- [Jeremy] He forgot.

92
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:43,908
- Okay.

93
00:02:43,908 --> 00:02:45,147
- Lise wrapped this.

94
00:02:45,147 --> 00:02:46,479
- Wow, she did a good job.

95
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,120
- Yeah, a ball.

96
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,178
- It's for me and you to play with.

97
00:02:50,178 --> 00:02:51,446
- [Isaac] Here.

98
00:02:51,446 --> 00:02:52,515
- [Jeremy] Boom.

99
00:02:52,515 --> 00:02:53,348
- Whoo!

100
00:02:53,348 --> 00:02:54,943
- [Caleb] Hey Isaac.

101
00:02:54,943 --> 00:02:56,036
- Thank you.

102
00:02:56,036 --> 00:02:56,914
- You're welcome.

103
00:02:56,914 --> 00:02:58,364
- I love it.
- That's a great present.

104
00:02:58,364 --> 00:03:00,145
- [Kendra] My turn, my turn.

105
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:02,029
- [Laura] Mama's turn.

106
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:04,537
- Okay, one, two, three.

107
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:07,647
(gasps) They're flowers.

108
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:10,502
I love 'em, they're white
and they're so pretty.

109
00:03:10,502 --> 00:03:12,382
I should put those in my bathroom.

110
00:03:12,382 --> 00:03:14,130
- You should, with water.

111
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,786
That would make it grow bigger.

112
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,967
- Yeah, with water to make it grow bigger?

113
00:03:18,967 --> 00:03:19,800
- Yeah.

114
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,986
- Daddy's turn.

115
00:03:20,986 --> 00:03:22,801
- It's very cold.

116
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:23,811
- Cold?

117
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:25,954
- (gasps) Mouthwash.

118
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:26,856
- I know.

119
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,909
- Is it a hint 'cause of my bad breath.

120
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:29,761
- Yeah.

121
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:32,624
(all laughing)

122
00:03:32,624 --> 00:03:33,457
- Thank you.

123
00:03:33,457 --> 00:03:34,290
- You're welcome.

124
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,728
- I always needed and honest little person

125
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:36,920
to help me out.

126
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,248
- Yeah.
- Thank you Laura.

127
00:03:38,248 --> 00:03:39,181
- I thought you would like it.

128
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,014
- I do like it.

129
00:03:40,014 --> 00:03:41,501
I love it.

130
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:44,739
- I really thought you
would like it at the store.

131
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:45,828
- Thank you.

132
00:03:45,828 --> 00:03:48,992
(Kendra laughs)

133
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:51,406
- I absolutely love the
gifts that the kids pick out.

134
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:53,815
That was awesome Laura,
you did a great job.

135
00:03:53,815 --> 00:03:54,648
- Thanks.

136
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,804
- [Kendra] Whose turn is it next?

137
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:58,029
- [Jeremy] Caleb.

138
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,862
- [Kendra] Caleb's up.

139
00:03:58,862 --> 00:04:01,224
- [Jeremy] So Laura is opening
her present from Caleb.

140
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,224
- Three, two, one, open!

141
00:04:06,724 --> 00:04:08,041
- Gum!

142
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:09,240
Yeah!

143
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,944
- Yeah!
- You love gum!

144
00:04:10,944 --> 00:04:11,998
- I know.

145
00:04:11,998 --> 00:04:12,831
Thank you.

146
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,888
- [Jeremy] 'Kay, go ahead Lise.

147
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,694
- [Kendra] Hey Caleb.

148
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:19,527
- Whoa!

149
00:04:19,527 --> 00:04:21,086
- [Jeremy] Double, different wrap.

150
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,249
(parents laughing)

151
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:23,605
- [Isaac] How 'bout you help her?

152
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:25,918
You can see through it a little it.

153
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:26,751
- [Jeremy] Okay.

154
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,713
- That was the problem.

155
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,820
- You get to color this.

156
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,597
And then there's more pages.

157
00:04:32,597 --> 00:04:34,140
- Thank you.

158
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,570
I like it.
- You color only those things

159
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,407
that are white, you can tell.

160
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:39,470
- Um hmm, yeah.

161
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,729
- [Kendra] Oh that's awesome.

162
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:42,199
- There's more you can color.

163
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,782
- Ready, set, open!

164
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:48,044
- It's the new NBA sticker collection.

165
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,999
This is awesome.

166
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,629
- [Jeremy] 2017 and 18.

167
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,629
- Thank you!

168
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:00,751
I love it.

169
00:05:02,413 --> 00:05:03,413
- I'm Cubby.

170
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,933
- Okay, here it comes.

171
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,562
- [Jeremy] She wants.

172
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:10,955
She wants the mouthwash.

173
00:05:10,955 --> 00:05:12,678
That's all she cares about.

174
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:14,011
- What's inside?

175
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:18,334
- It's things on top of her person.

176
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:20,147
- (gasps) It's so pretty.

177
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:23,018
- It's for to go on top
of her car seat I think.

178
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:24,947
- It's Cinderella.

179
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:27,411
- You can play with it.

180
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:29,013
- Say thank you Caleb.

181
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:30,530
- I like that it's so.

182
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,261
(Janae fusses)
- Where's my mouthwash?

183
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:35,682
She then calmed down once we
got her the mouthwash again.

184
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,501
- So apparently Janae loves the mouthwash.

185
00:05:37,501 --> 00:05:39,300
But this is so cute Caleb.

186
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,133
Thank you.

187
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:40,966
She's gonna really love that

188
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,668
when she gets over her mouthwash phase.

189
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,936
Is this for me?
- Yeah.

190
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:44,973
- For me?
- Yeah.

191
00:05:44,973 --> 00:05:45,973
- Me?
- Yeah.

192
00:05:49,408 --> 00:05:50,428
Did you wrap this one?

193
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:51,261
- Yep.

194
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:52,094
- You did a really great job.

195
00:05:52,094 --> 00:05:54,019
And you wrote to Mom, from Caleb.

196
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:56,140
(playful music)

197
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,372
- It doesn't shake.

198
00:05:57,372 --> 00:05:58,205
- Ready?

199
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,953
Set.

200
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:03,570
(gasps) It's a Christmas mug.

201
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,290
I've been wanting one of those.

202
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,100
Oh thanks buddy.

203
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,517
So there's the Christmas mug.

204
00:06:11,306 --> 00:06:12,594
I love that.

205
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:15,266
I've been really enjoying
apple cinnamon herbal tea.

206
00:06:15,266 --> 00:06:17,474
This is gonna be perfect for it.

207
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:18,328
- I think that you're keeping

208
00:06:18,328 --> 00:06:21,063
this tradition alive with this one.

209
00:06:21,063 --> 00:06:22,695
Go long.

210
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:25,418
(laughing)

211
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:26,415
(growls)

212
00:06:26,415 --> 00:06:27,307
Whoop.

213
00:06:27,307 --> 00:06:28,812
- What?

214
00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:30,190
- The football.
- Look how cool.

215
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:32,083
- 'Kay, go deep.

216
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,762
Aw.
- So close!

217
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,350
- I knew you'd get one.

218
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,528
- Yep, every year I get one.

219
00:06:37,528 --> 00:06:39,641
- Every year one of the
kids gets Jeremy a football.

220
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,236
And it's a tradition and he loves it

221
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,498
and they love it.

222
00:06:42,498 --> 00:06:43,339
- Off the wall.

223
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,306
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

224
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:46,898
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

225
00:06:46,898 --> 00:06:48,585
Nice one Caleb.

226
00:06:48,585 --> 00:06:49,502
Nice Isaac.

227
00:06:50,645 --> 00:06:51,728
- Oh!
- Daddy!

228
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:54,108
- Boom.

229
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:58,374
Oh. (laughs)

230
00:06:58,374 --> 00:07:01,657
It's purple and orange
with a turbo Nerf version.

231
00:07:01,657 --> 00:07:03,579
Little lighter than I would prefer.

232
00:07:03,579 --> 00:07:06,970
But quite comfortable to the hands.

233
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,705
Lise's starting to pass out the presents.

234
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:10,876
- Here's Nae Nae's.

235
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,102
Dad.
- Yes.

236
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:12,935
- Caleb.

237
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:15,053
Laura.

238
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:16,573
Isaac.

239
00:07:16,573 --> 00:07:18,842
I kinda forgot what I got you.

240
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:21,072
- I think I know what this is.

241
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,905
- So it's like, nails.

242
00:07:24,397 --> 00:07:26,407
- Oh yeah, it is some.

243
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:27,867
- So it's when you paint your nails.

244
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,772
- Oh yeah.
- You can paint over it

245
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:33,017
with like a little thing

246
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,376
and then you can put decorations on it.

247
00:07:35,376 --> 00:07:37,303
- It does nail art.
- I remember this.

248
00:07:37,303 --> 00:07:38,709
I remember this.

249
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:39,542
Thank you!

250
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,165
- Ready?

251
00:07:42,165 --> 00:07:42,998
Set.

252
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:43,831
Go.

253
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:47,303
What is this?

254
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,461
- [Jeremy] Do you know what that's called?

255
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:50,054
- What?
- A slinky.

256
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,158
They are cool.

257
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:53,129
Fun to play with.

258
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,420
- Thank you.

259
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,837
- You're welcome.

260
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,306
(Jeremy laughing)

261
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,250
- I really wanted sunglasses.

262
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,396
I haven't had them in like--
- Sunglasses!

263
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:05,067
- You can have 'em
- That is awesome.

264
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,687
- while you're playing sports.

265
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,004
- [Kendra] They're sports one.

266
00:08:09,004 --> 00:08:09,939
- Yeah.
- Ooo.

267
00:08:09,939 --> 00:08:11,007
- Thank you.

268
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,068
- You're welcome.

269
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:12,901
- Let's help her.

270
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,091
You ready?

271
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:15,617
Go!

272
00:08:15,617 --> 00:08:16,744
(gasps)

273
00:08:16,744 --> 00:08:17,956
There it is.

274
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,853
- A bouncy ball.
- Your very own ball.

275
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:22,423
- She loves it.

276
00:08:22,423 --> 00:08:23,983
That's how you know she loves it.

277
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,992
- [Jeremy] She tries to eat it.

278
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:27,865
- I like your sunglasses Isaac.

279
00:08:27,865 --> 00:08:29,236
- [Jeremy] Come over Isaac.

280
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:30,518
(Janae babbles)

281
00:08:30,518 --> 00:08:32,929
(all laughing)

282
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,467
Isaac.
- It's like why is that

283
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:35,476
hanging in your nose?

284
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:36,927
- [Jeremy] So one cute thing about Nae Nae

285
00:08:36,927 --> 00:08:39,510
is she says Isaac all the time.

286
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:41,415
- All the time.

287
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,087
And it sounds like Isaac.

288
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,995
- [Jeremy] But she'll say Isaac.

289
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:47,326
(Janae babbles)
- See, she said Mama.

290
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:48,522
- [Jeremy] Say Isaac.

291
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:50,939
Hi Isaac.
- Can you say Isaac?

292
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,482
- [Laura] Mom, I'm holding your presents.

293
00:08:55,482 --> 00:08:56,410
- Look how cute.

294
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,493
- [Jeremy] Oh, way to go.

295
00:09:00,072 --> 00:09:01,564
(Kendra gasps)
What did Elise get Mom?

296
00:09:01,564 --> 00:09:02,606
- It's makeup!

297
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:03,439
- Uh huh.

298
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:04,485
- This is really pretty.

299
00:09:04,485 --> 00:09:05,409
- It's like light blue.

300
00:09:05,409 --> 00:09:07,556
- It's called Smokey Eyes.

301
00:09:07,556 --> 00:09:09,463
It should give me a shnazzy look.

302
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:10,437
- (laughs) Yeah.

303
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,316
- Do you wanna give me a makeover?

304
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:12,192
- Yeah!

305
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:13,136
- Thank you.

306
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,803
(playful music)

307
00:09:16,793 --> 00:09:19,390
- I wonder what it could be.

308
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,807
- You'll love it.

309
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:23,371
It's what Mom got you.

310
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,374
- Socks!

311
00:09:24,374 --> 00:09:26,348
- Uh huh.
- I love dress socks

312
00:09:26,348 --> 00:09:27,181
that are cool.

313
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:28,439
Thank you so much.

314
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:30,027
- [Laura] Can I smell 'em Daddy?

315
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,209
- You can smell 'em.
- You could wear them

316
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:32,387
to like church.
- It's important

317
00:09:32,387 --> 00:09:34,599
to smell socks as often as you can.

318
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,870
Awesome.

319
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,703
I love you.

320
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:38,036
- Daddy!

321
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:39,954
- And you.
(Kendra laughs)

322
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,201
- [Kendra] Isaac, you're up.

323
00:09:41,201 --> 00:09:42,789
- [Jeremy] Is it your turn
to pass out the presents?

324
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,211
- Yep.
- Smooth man.

325
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,455
- Here.
- For me?

326
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,518
- To the Jerminator.

327
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:48,964
- [Jeremy] The Jerminator.

328
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:50,073
- Caleb.

329
00:09:50,073 --> 00:09:51,140
To Nae Nae.

330
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,183
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae.

331
00:09:52,183 --> 00:09:53,746
- Laura.

332
00:09:53,746 --> 00:09:54,742
- I know.

333
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:56,368
- And Mom.

334
00:09:56,368 --> 00:09:57,201
- Whoo.

335
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,459
- My own mirror!

336
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:06,315
- [Jeremy] Your very own mirror.

337
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:07,148
- Thanks.

338
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:12,878
I'm gonna get my makeup.

339
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,417
- [Jeremy] She's off. (laughs)

340
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:15,744
Caleb's up.

341
00:10:15,744 --> 00:10:17,124
- I'll have to tell you about it.

342
00:10:17,124 --> 00:10:18,573
It's tools.

343
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:20,823
- [Jeremy] He got ya tools.

344
00:10:22,034 --> 00:10:23,411
Caleb likes tools.

345
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,411
- Thank you.

346
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:26,887
- [Jeremy] Elise's turn.

347
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:27,720
- Ready?
- Um hmm.

348
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,603
- It's a lot smaller than it looks.

349
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:33,550
- (gasps) A fan!

350
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,164
- [Kendra] That is beautiful.

351
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:36,428
- I love it.

352
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:37,261
Thank you.

353
00:10:41,395 --> 00:10:43,334
- [Jeremy] A cement truck.

354
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:44,667
- [Kendra] Yeah.

355
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,585
- [Jeremy] Not socks.

356
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:52,034
- (gasps) Sunglasses!

357
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:53,692
Thank you.

358
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:56,876
I can always use an
extra set of sunglasses

359
00:10:56,876 --> 00:10:58,911
'cause I'm always losing mine.

360
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,078
- That's true.

361
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:05,101
I told them to get me this one.

362
00:11:05,101 --> 00:11:06,433
Thanks!

363
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,153
It's an extra cord so that
we can listen to music

364
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:10,039
like when we're driving.

365
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,008
- You've been listening to,

366
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:13,790
you've been making
playlists a lot recently.

367
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,623
- It's true.

368
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,866
And so it's a cord that
helps us listen to music.

369
00:11:16,866 --> 00:11:19,074
- [Kendra] Yay, that means
the whole family benefits.

370
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:19,907
- Thank you man.

371
00:11:19,907 --> 00:11:21,623
- [Kendra] You guys ready
for Janae Nae's gifts?

372
00:11:21,623 --> 00:11:22,456
- Yeah!

373
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:24,189
- You give this to Lise.

374
00:11:24,189 --> 00:11:25,378
Lise.

375
00:11:25,378 --> 00:11:26,344
Give it to Lise.

376
00:11:26,344 --> 00:11:28,421
(kids laughing)

377
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,754
Give it to Lise.

378
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,910
- [Jeremy] Yay!

379
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:37,427
- Alright, give it to Laura.

380
00:11:38,975 --> 00:11:41,558
(all laughing)

381
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,290
- [Jeremy] No, give it back.

382
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,707
- Now give this one to Caleb.

383
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:51,103
She still wants Laura's present.

384
00:11:51,103 --> 00:11:53,587
- [Jeremy] She's like I was
just able to shake that thing.

385
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,388
And it made noise.

386
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:56,463
Can you give that one to Daddy?

387
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:57,510
We're gonna open this one first,

388
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,697
'cause Janae's holding it.

389
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,375
- [Jeremy] What did Nae Nae get for Mom?

390
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,485
- Hmm.

391
00:12:01,485 --> 00:12:03,234
- [Jeremy] Hopefully you like it.

392
00:12:03,234 --> 00:12:05,961
- (gasps) It's salt and pepper shakers.

393
00:12:05,961 --> 00:12:07,063
- [Jeremy] Yay!

394
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:08,174
- That's perfect, we need those.

395
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:09,007
- Big time.

396
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,686
We're still using a salt shaker

397
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:14,489
that we got at a white elephant party

398
00:12:14,489 --> 00:12:16,443
in 2005?
- It's like this big.

399
00:12:16,443 --> 00:12:17,427
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

400
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:18,567
- It's too small.

401
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:19,589
And so we always run out.

402
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:20,938
- It's like this big so you pretty much

403
00:12:20,938 --> 00:12:22,515
pour out salt and then it's empty again.

404
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:23,777
- [Jeremy] What did Janae Nae get Laura?

405
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:25,694
- She choose which one.

406
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,270
- Cards?

407
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,245
- It's not cards.

408
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:30,251
It's a puzzle.

409
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,038
Who's on the front?

410
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:34,344
- Elana of Avalor puzzle.

411
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,677
- It is.
- Thank you Nae Nae.

412
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,901
- It's Elana of Avalor puzzle.

413
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,571
- [Jeremy] What did Nae Nae get Elise?

414
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:42,545
- Nail art.

415
00:12:42,545 --> 00:12:43,973
See, a nail art?

416
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,121
- [Jeremy] Perfect.

417
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:47,513
- Oh my.

418
00:12:47,513 --> 00:12:49,156
Yeah!

419
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,588
- [Jeremy] He got a
football sticker collection.

420
00:12:51,588 --> 00:12:53,588
- I needed the 2017 one.

421
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,982
Thank you!

422
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:56,982
I wanted it.

423
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,375
- It's a FIFA sticker collection.

424
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:03,208
Yes!

425
00:13:04,143 --> 00:13:05,276
Yes!

426
00:13:05,276 --> 00:13:06,524
Thank you.

427
00:13:06,524 --> 00:13:07,583
(parents laughing)

428
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,001
You tricked me Mom.

429
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:09,834
- I didn't trick you.

430
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:11,114
Dad tricked you.

431
00:13:11,114 --> 00:13:12,019
He wrapped it like that.

432
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,386
- That was good.

433
00:13:13,386 --> 00:13:14,268
- [Jeremy] Gotcha.

434
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:18,103
- 'Cause every time it's a
sticker collection I know.

435
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:19,893
- Yep, but not this time.

436
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:20,976
Last present.

437
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:24,848
Envelopes, normal ones.

438
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,577
So, we sometimes need envelopes

439
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,250
and we haven't had 'em for like a year.

440
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:33,151
And we'll only have the
little, gift size envelopes.

441
00:13:33,151 --> 00:13:34,854
So I'm sending like a legal letter,

442
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:36,185
this is too embarrassing.

443
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,968
- [Kendra] He sends like
legal documents in these

444
00:13:37,968 --> 00:13:39,929
like party invitation envelopes.

445
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:41,915
- I had to send something
to the Kansas Supreme Court

446
00:13:41,915 --> 00:13:44,756
and it was like, it
was like in an envelope

447
00:13:44,756 --> 00:13:47,565
that was a square, like here you go.

448
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:48,926
So thank you.

449
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:50,595
I really am happy about this.

450
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,129
- [Kendra] Good job Janae.

451
00:13:52,129 --> 00:13:53,298
What do you guys say?

452
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:55,228
- [Kids] Thank you.

453
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:57,227
- J House out.

454
00:13:57,227 --> 00:13:58,060
- [Kendra] You know it's a good toy

455
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,372
when Jeremy wants to try.

456
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:02,209
(playful Christmas music)

457
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:03,042
Whoa!

458
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,097
- I could live in these.

459
00:14:04,097 --> 00:14:05,764
I can do everything.

460
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:11,090
- [Kendra] We all go a
little strong with the makeup

461
00:14:11,090 --> 00:00:00,000
when we start out.
