1
00:00:00,027 --> 00:00:01,503
- So we're headed out hiking today.

2
00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:05,482
(adventurous guitar music)

3
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:07,378
- So they found a crew
for the treasure hunt.

4
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:08,573
Eat a lime?

5
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:09,498
- Oh!

6
00:00:09,498 --> 00:00:13,422
(adventurous guitar music)

7
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,951
- [Jeremy] The kids are
just snuggling with Mom!

8
00:00:15,951 --> 00:00:19,534
(adventurous guitar music)

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,713
(light guitar music)

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,803
- Well, we're so sad.

11
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:34,038
We're saying goodbye to
Papa and Mugga this morning.

12
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,602
- [Mugga] Another one? Two hugs huh?

13
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,635
- I'll see you in February.

14
00:00:38,635 --> 00:00:40,071
- I'll see you in February.

15
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:43,037
- [Kendra] How old will
you be then, Laura?

16
00:00:43,037 --> 00:00:43,879
- Four.

17
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:44,712
- Gotta hug Papa.

18
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,793
- Oh, you definitely need a hug (laughs).

19
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:49,833
My little girl.

20
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:51,565
- Thanks for coming.

21
00:00:51,565 --> 00:00:53,368
- Thanks for inviting us.

22
00:00:53,368 --> 00:00:55,709
- [Papa] We're gonna be home tonight.

23
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:59,393
(light guitar music)

24
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:01,288
(kiss smacks)

25
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:02,824
- Party wave, remember, like this?

26
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:04,968
Woo! Party wave!

27
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:05,801
- Bye.

28
00:01:05,801 --> 00:01:06,684
- [Kendra] Bye, guys.
- [Kids] Bye.

29
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:07,517
- Have fun!

30
00:01:07,517 --> 00:01:09,263
- Drive safe!

31
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:11,135
- See you soon!
(car horn honks)

32
00:01:11,135 --> 00:01:13,112
- I'm sad about them.

33
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:14,345
- Me too.

34
00:01:14,345 --> 00:01:15,302
- [Jeremy] It's sad when they go away.

35
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:17,174
- It's hard to say goodbye, huh?

36
00:01:17,174 --> 00:01:19,792
Well, we just had a really
good experience as a family.

37
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:20,802
All of us were pretty sad

38
00:01:20,802 --> 00:01:22,040
to see Grandma and Papa
leave this morning,

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,344
and I don't know if that's what it was,

40
00:01:23,344 --> 00:01:25,610
but the kids were just going nuts.

41
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,371
And I started getting irritated with them,

42
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:28,754
and so I called them into the family room,

43
00:01:28,754 --> 00:01:30,025
and we had 'em sit down,

44
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:32,750
and I was planning on lecturing them.

45
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,890
And somehow when I saw them
all sitting there on the couch,

46
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,882
something changed, and I felt like instead

47
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,612
of telling them all
about their misbehavior

48
00:01:41,612 --> 00:01:43,662
we should focus on the
positive as a family.

49
00:01:43,662 --> 00:01:45,427
So we grabbed some tennis balls,

50
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:47,225
and we started tossing 'em back and forth,

51
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,709
naming things that we
loved about our family

52
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,690
and things that we were grateful for

53
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,902
and things that were
going well in our family.

54
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:58,150
And it was amazing to see
how focusing on the positive

55
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,301
cheered all of us up and reminded
us of how we should behave

56
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:02,874
instead of focusing on the negative

57
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:05,573
and just getting everybody more upset.

58
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:07,841
I don't always remember
to do that as a mom,

59
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,866
but it's what I'm trying to do.

60
00:02:09,866 --> 00:02:11,143
We ended off that activity with

61
00:02:11,143 --> 00:02:12,501
Jeremy juggling for all of us.

62
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:14,435
And I think it's kind of reset our mood,

63
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,446
so hopefully the day can move forward with

64
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:19,180
a little bit better behavior
and a lot more happiness.

65
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,513
(exciting guitar music)

66
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,684
So we're headed out hiking today

67
00:02:24,684 --> 00:02:26,916
to a place called Annie's Canyon Trail,

68
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:27,999
- [Jeremy] Looks awesome.

69
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,996
- Yeah, the pictures
online look incredible.

70
00:02:29,996 --> 00:02:30,829
We're excited.

71
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,287
We're actually gonna meet up
with some friends there, too.

72
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:34,188
- So we're here at the trail,

73
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,906
and they have a pole with wet paint.

74
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,049
We stopped and told the kids
all about this in the car.

75
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:39,262
- Before we got out of the car.

76
00:02:39,262 --> 00:02:40,819
And we're like, "don't touch it."

77
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:42,611
It was the very first thing that happened!

78
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:44,198
- [Jeremy] Without even
trying, it was an accident,

79
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:46,687
Laura touched it, but your
hands don't look brown.

80
00:02:46,687 --> 00:02:47,562
So I think we're okay.

81
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:50,172
All right, we're at
the start of the trail.

82
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:53,839
(adventurous country music)

83
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,652
So this goes right up to a lagoon.

84
00:02:57,652 --> 00:02:58,991
And Kendra--

85
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:01,365
- I'm very grateful that we
are in California, not Florida,

86
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,832
because I am terrified of alligators,

87
00:03:02,832 --> 00:03:04,560
and California doesn't have alligators.

88
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,393
At least I don't think.

89
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,790
- Alligators eat you.

90
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,661
- [Kendra] Yeah, alligators
are not friendly.

91
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,180
- [Jeremy] So we don't know what this is

92
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,163
or what these cones are,

93
00:03:12,163 --> 00:03:13,669
we're trying to figure it out.

94
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,336
(adventurous country music)

95
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:19,755
- Look there's a cactus!

96
00:03:19,755 --> 00:03:21,769
This is feeling very Arizon-ness.

97
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:23,506
- [Jeremy] Arizona-ish?

98
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:24,579
- Arizona-ish.

99
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,402
(adventurous country music)

100
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:27,235
Kinda tired?

101
00:03:27,235 --> 00:03:28,068
- Yeah.

102
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:29,189
- [Jeremy] We're almost there, come on.

103
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,341
(adventurous country music)

104
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:33,869
I'm loving she's keeping her hat on!

105
00:03:33,869 --> 00:03:36,060
- I tricked her- I gave
her a water bottle to hold.

106
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,866
- [Jeremy] Oh, she doesn't
normally like hats or hair bows.

107
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:41,453
(singing)

108
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,408
- You singing?

109
00:03:43,408 --> 00:03:44,305
Good song.

110
00:03:44,305 --> 00:03:46,087
- So we thought about getting
one of those hiking backpacks

111
00:03:46,087 --> 00:03:47,427
because we're hoping to hike a bunch

112
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,561
while we're here in San Diego,

113
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,176
and then we realized, wait a
minute, Jeremy has shoulders!

114
00:03:51,176 --> 00:03:52,009
(Laura singing)

115
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:53,250
- Yay.

116
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:56,887
(harmonica music)

117
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:00,043
So there's a strenuous
way, and a moderate way.

118
00:04:00,043 --> 00:04:01,694
I'm wanting to try the strenuous.

119
00:04:01,694 --> 00:04:02,853
Anyone else want to go with me?

120
00:04:02,853 --> 00:04:03,686
- Me.
- [Laura] Me.

121
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:05,997
- [Jeremy] You might have
to be climbing cliffs.

122
00:04:05,997 --> 00:04:07,413
- Deal.
- Deal.

123
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,405
So we are meeting up
with The Ohana Adventure

124
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:10,238
- Hi guys!
- and their family.

125
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:12,165
They're doing a treasure hunt right now,

126
00:04:12,165 --> 00:04:15,051
and we're joining them
for the end portion of it.

127
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,312
- That's right, we are looking,
and hopefully we'll find

128
00:04:17,312 --> 00:04:20,065
a clue or a treasure or something here.

129
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:21,705
- [Jeremy] This is so cool!

130
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:22,834
- [Kendra] Wow!
- Yeah!

131
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:26,501
(adventurous country music)

132
00:04:28,286 --> 00:04:30,631
- [Jeremy] Keep going!

133
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:32,152
Coming through?

134
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:33,214
Laura, I think it's gonna be good

135
00:04:33,214 --> 00:04:36,291
that you're so short and skinny!

136
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,335
I don't know if I'm
gonna fit through here.

137
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:41,376
(adventurous country music)

138
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:43,629
Kendra! Can you fit through here with her?

139
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:44,753
- We're gonna fit.

140
00:04:44,753 --> 00:04:45,714
- [Jeremy] Okay.

141
00:04:45,714 --> 00:04:46,547
- We're coming.
- [Jeremy] She likes it!

142
00:04:46,547 --> 00:04:48,023
She loves the adventure!

143
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:50,948
(adventurous country music).

144
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:52,109
What do you think, Caleb?

145
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,569
We gonna fit through?

146
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:54,402
- Yeah.

147
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:56,045
- Laura is a little nervous,
but she's being brave

148
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,628
and continuing up this
skinny, narrow path.

149
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:03,929
- [Caleb] Whoa!

150
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,290
That's always comforting
when you're hiking in cliffs.

151
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,123
(laughs)

152
00:05:07,123 --> 00:05:11,610
(adventurous country music)

153
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,735
Caleb!

154
00:05:12,735 --> 00:05:14,891
You climbin' up?

155
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:16,042
Good job!

156
00:05:16,042 --> 00:05:18,616
- This is kinda crazy, I've
never been in this place.

157
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,666
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae, you climbin'?

158
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,136
- I'm gonna get it
- [Jeremy] Keep coming.

159
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:25,161
(adventurous country music)

160
00:05:25,161 --> 00:05:28,244
(light guitar music)

161
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:31,555
- [Jeremy] You like hiking?

162
00:05:31,555 --> 00:05:32,888
- Yep-a-dee-yep.

163
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,416
- [Jeremy] Yep-a-dee-yep.

164
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,425
(laughs)

165
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:40,425
(adventurous island drum music)

166
00:05:44,145 --> 00:05:45,416
What'd you guys think of the hike?

167
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,403
- I loved it!

168
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:47,800
- [Jeremy] Wasn't that cool?
- I did it two times!

169
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,961
- Yeah, that was fun.

170
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:51,165
- We went on a hike, we found a treasure!

171
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:51,998
- Woo!

172
00:05:51,998 --> 00:05:55,592
(adventurous island drum music)

173
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:56,832
- Well, we were excited to hear that

174
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:58,257
The Ohana Adventure was in town

175
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:00,064
and to be able to have a
chance to meet up with them.

176
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:02,401
After our hike, we are craving food,

177
00:06:02,401 --> 00:06:03,806
and so we're going to a taco stand

178
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:06,687
that is conveniently
called The Taco Stand.

179
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:08,565
(wooden clave music)

180
00:06:08,565 --> 00:06:11,629
- Look at these trees, I love them!

181
00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:13,570
I don't know what kind they
are, but they're gorgeous!

182
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,049
- [Caleb] And they're good for growing.

183
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:16,522
Yeah, they are good for growing.

184
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:17,954
- [Jeremy] The Taco Stand.

185
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:19,473
- So when we're traveling,
I love to hear tips

186
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,399
for good local food,
and so we're trying this

187
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,514
Taco Stand place and we
hear it's really good.

188
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:26,176
(exciting drum music)

189
00:06:26,176 --> 00:06:28,483
So we've heard about
this California burrito,

190
00:06:28,483 --> 00:06:31,011
which is a carne asada burrito
with french fries in it.

191
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:33,511
So Jeremy's gonna give that try.

192
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:35,551
- I mean, I love a carne asada burrito.

193
00:06:35,551 --> 00:06:38,747
Adding french fries to stuff
normally only makes it better.

194
00:06:38,747 --> 00:06:41,439
- [Kendra] They have amazing
Mexican popsicles here.

195
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,865
- [Jeremy] Our food!

196
00:06:43,865 --> 00:06:44,698
- Check this out.
- [Jeremy] Oh this looks

197
00:06:44,698 --> 00:06:46,589
so good.
- [Kendra] Yum!

198
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,420
(exciting island music)

199
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,253
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

200
00:06:51,253 --> 00:06:54,238
- So this is the California Burrito.

201
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:55,690
- [Rachel] Did you get the fries?

202
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,302
- Yep, we're trying it.

203
00:06:58,302 --> 00:07:01,469
(bouncy guitar music)

204
00:07:04,568 --> 00:07:06,234
- [Jeremy] Eat a lime?
- Mmhm.

205
00:07:06,234 --> 00:07:07,148
- Oh!

206
00:07:07,148 --> 00:07:09,231
(laughs)

207
00:07:10,803 --> 00:07:12,403
- Wow.
- [Jeremy] You want more?

208
00:07:12,403 --> 00:07:13,236
You don't have to eat it,

209
00:07:13,236 --> 00:07:14,069
obviously.
- Maybe.

210
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:16,879
Why did you decide to eat a lime?

211
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,712
Were your friends doing it?

212
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,629
- I really like lemons.

213
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:22,604
- Wow, that's...

214
00:07:23,561 --> 00:07:24,749
- [Jeremy] Sour.

215
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,847
- That really good.

216
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,097
(Mexican guitar music)

217
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:32,938
- [Kendra] Do you see what she's making?

218
00:07:32,938 --> 00:07:33,784
- Tortillas.

219
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:34,829
- [Kendra] What kind?

220
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,662
- Wheat?

221
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:36,562
- [Kendra] Corn.

222
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:37,406
- Corn.

223
00:07:37,406 --> 00:07:38,824
- [Kendra] Corn tortillas.

224
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:39,948
(Mexican guitar music)

225
00:07:39,948 --> 00:07:41,891
- This is really good food.

226
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:43,197
Tickle torture time!

227
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,051
- [Jase] Get the toes and the arms!

228
00:07:45,051 --> 00:07:45,960
- [Jeremy] Oh no!

229
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,390
(screeching)

230
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,487
We got her!

231
00:07:48,487 --> 00:07:50,272
They're like lining up for the torture.

232
00:07:50,272 --> 00:07:52,075
- Wait, you want to be tortured?

233
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:52,908
That's it!

234
00:07:52,908 --> 00:07:55,158
(laughing)

235
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,322
- This is how we help our
kids grow and get longer.

236
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:03,174
- Well, we decided to come
back out to the beach.

237
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:05,502
(Maraca music)

238
00:08:05,502 --> 00:08:06,735
- We're trying this today.

239
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:07,693
You put baking powder,

240
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:08,924
- apparently.
- [Jeremy] Baby powder.

241
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:11,402
- (laughs) Baby powder.

242
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:13,775
On your feet and stuff
before you get in the sand

243
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:15,062
and then apparently it makes the sand

244
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,243
not stick to you so much,

245
00:08:16,243 --> 00:08:18,103
so you don't take half the
ocean home in your car.

246
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:19,102
So this is our experiment, guys,

247
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:21,131
we'll let you know how it goes.

248
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:23,945
- [Jeremy] And you have
it all over your face.

249
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:24,895
Put it all over your--

250
00:08:24,895 --> 00:08:26,758
- Our family has some
interesting traditions.

251
00:08:26,758 --> 00:08:28,182
- [Jeremy] The Ohana
Adventure has a little more

252
00:08:28,182 --> 00:08:29,972
expertise with the ocean.

253
00:08:29,972 --> 00:08:30,887
- No, she hasn't tried it she said.

254
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:32,302
- I have never tried the baby powder.

255
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:33,309
Jackie was just telling me about it.

256
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,142
- [Jeremy] Yes.

257
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,389
- We just--
- We just do it after.

258
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,482
- [Jeremy] After. Afterwards.

259
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,144
- So they're saying baking
powder is for after.

260
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:39,072
- [Jeremy] Baby powder.

261
00:08:39,072 --> 00:08:39,937
- Baby powder.

262
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:40,770
Man!
- [Jeremy] And then cook at

263
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,215
- I can't get this right!
- [Jeremy] 350 degrees

264
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:43,131
for 20 minutes.
- I give up

265
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:43,996
Go play in the ocean.

266
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:45,166
- [Jeremy] Go get in the ocean.

267
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,317
(adventurous music)

268
00:08:47,317 --> 00:08:49,103
Do you see all the rocks?

269
00:08:49,103 --> 00:08:49,936
- Yeah.

270
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:52,519
(island music)

271
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:55,467
- Whoa!

272
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,427
(screaming)

273
00:08:57,427 --> 00:08:59,215
- [Jeremy] Hop. Bop.

274
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:00,215
There we go.

275
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:03,361
It's mesmerizing.

276
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:04,259
Are you wet?

277
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:05,092
- Yeah.

278
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:05,925
- [Jeremy] It's inevitable.

279
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:07,493
- I just love it!

280
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,243
- [Jeremy] Set, hike!

281
00:09:10,643 --> 00:09:11,792
Caleb!

282
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,011
- Did you get wet, dude?

283
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:13,844
- [Jeremy] You all wet?

284
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:14,822
- Mommy said I could.

285
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:15,780
- [Jeremy] Okay.

286
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,883
If Mom said, you go get crazy.

287
00:09:17,883 --> 00:09:21,293
(fun island music)

288
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:22,912
You gonna go in and get wet?

289
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:24,056
- Yeah.

290
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,011
(fun island music)

291
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,526
(screaming)

292
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,776
(laughing)

293
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,155
- So our plan was just have
the kids play in the sand

294
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:40,475
and not get wet.

295
00:09:40,475 --> 00:09:41,674
- [Jeremy] Yeah, that's
never gonna happen.

296
00:09:41,674 --> 00:09:43,760
- Yeah, guess how well that plan worked.

297
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,877
- It's just too much fun.

298
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,177
It's too alluring.

299
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:48,844
(wave crashing)

300
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,357
- Janae loves the seagulls,

301
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:52,813
she's saying hello to each one.

302
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:54,183
"Hi, hi!"

303
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:55,141
- [Jeremy] Hey, seagull!

304
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:58,723
(light guitar music)

305
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,626
- You see that? "Hi!"

306
00:09:59,626 --> 00:10:00,515
- [Jeremy] It's a doggy!

307
00:10:00,515 --> 00:10:02,117
(baby squeals)

308
00:10:02,117 --> 00:10:03,062
"Let me touch it!"

309
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,150
- So we've decided that
for Janae's first birthday

310
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,438
instead of inviting humans
over for a birthday party,

311
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:08,858
we should invited dogs.

312
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,826
(baby squeals)

313
00:10:10,826 --> 00:10:13,179
- [Kendra] Come back!
- [Jeremy] Don't go!

314
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,545
(baby gurgles)

315
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:15,773
(laughing)

316
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:16,606
- Yo!

317
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:20,712
- I did this.

318
00:10:20,712 --> 00:10:22,222
- [Jeremy] This is awesome.

319
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:25,305
(light guitar music)

320
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,894
- So this has been a fun
stage with each of our kids

321
00:10:34,894 --> 00:10:36,938
when they're getting just
old enough to really start

322
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:39,215
connecting and
communicating with all of us

323
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,448
and learning how to walk and talk more.

324
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:43,651
It's just a really fun time.

325
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,706
She's clapping!

326
00:10:44,706 --> 00:10:45,956
- [Family] Yay!

327
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,594
- [Jeremy] Look, she's wanting to stand.

328
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:49,427
Oh!

329
00:10:50,621 --> 00:10:52,833
(baby babbling)

330
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,120
- [Caleb] Now she's saying "brother."

331
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,953
(family cheering)

332
00:10:58,988 --> 00:11:00,339
- You see her? Clap, clap, clap.

333
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:02,346
(laughing)

334
00:11:02,346 --> 00:11:03,744
(family cheering)

335
00:11:03,744 --> 00:11:05,019
- [Jeremy] She dancin'.

336
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:05,991
- [Caleb] Yeah!

337
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,991
(Jeremy beatboxing)

338
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:15,084
- Janae just makes us so happy.

339
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:17,764
(family cheering)

340
00:11:17,764 --> 00:11:19,211
She stood for a while
- Yeah, I clapped.

341
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,150
- [Jeremy] without touching anything.

342
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:21,983
- Isaac!

343
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,793
- Hi.

344
00:11:24,877 --> 00:11:27,085
- [Jeremy] The kids are just
snuggling with Mom. (laughs)

345
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:28,923
What's fun though is Nae
Nae started all this.

346
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:31,416
She was just rolling around and

347
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,601
playing with Mom.
- Hi, Nae Nae.

348
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,851
(laughing)

349
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,833
It's 'cause I just showered so I'm clean.

350
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,576
(laughing)

351
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,604
- Good night. J House out.

352
00:11:42,604 --> 00:11:43,571
- [Jeremy] Sometimes
you gotta get a picture,

353
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:45,912
you gotta climb with
your family down a cliff.

354
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:47,406
(bouncy music)

355
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:50,466
- Getting a family of seven
ready for family pictures.

356
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:51,543
It's not a joke.

357
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:54,115
(bouncy music)

358
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:55,041
- You can't be in California

359
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,048
without going to In-N-Out Burger.

360
00:11:57,048 --> 00:00:00,000
(bouncy music)
