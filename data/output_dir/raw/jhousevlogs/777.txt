1
00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:01,474
- All right, I just gassed up.

2
00:00:01,474 --> 00:00:03,521
And we are hitting the
road, heading to Denver.

3
00:00:03,521 --> 00:00:06,117
I am the appointed
night-driver in our family,

4
00:00:06,117 --> 00:00:08,430
and I get a little loopy,
but I get the job done.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,756
So, I'll see you guys in
the morning in Denver.

6
00:00:10,756 --> 00:00:13,089
(pop music)

7
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:21,192
I slept like an hour, maybe,

8
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:24,103
'cause I had to pee so
bad, I couldn't sleep!

9
00:00:24,103 --> 00:00:25,158
Okay, so here's the thing,

10
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,437
is I just rolled down the windows,

11
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:27,662
and I'm taking pictures,

12
00:00:27,662 --> 00:00:29,912
and I'm like, Jeremy, people
say Kansas is not pretty,

13
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:31,791
but look at this, this is gorgeous,

14
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:34,159
and he's like, Kendra, we're in Colorado.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,076
I'm like, o-o-oh, fail!

16
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,634
It was dark the whole
time I was in Kansas.

17
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:42,452
I have nothing to say
about Kansas, it was dark.

18
00:00:42,452 --> 00:00:45,311
The directions were easy, go straight.

19
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,293
(soft rock music)

20
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:50,416
Even little Laura's doin' it!

21
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,620
- [Jeremy] Do it, Laura, whoo!

22
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,069
- All right, so our
first stop this morning

23
00:00:54,069 --> 00:00:56,586
was here at City Park in downtown Denver.

24
00:00:56,586 --> 00:00:58,972
Check out this view.

25
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:01,647
There's a playground and
some very friendly chipmunks.

26
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:03,836
And lots of geese and walking paths.

27
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:04,994
It's really pretty.

28
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:07,827
(classical music)

29
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,694
- [Together] Whee-hee-hee!

30
00:01:20,694 --> 00:01:21,888
(Jeremy laughing)

31
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:22,971
- [Mom] What?

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,207
- It's fun to ride on Dad.

33
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,096
- [Mom] Nice!

34
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:33,206
- So, Kendra saw that there was a big,

35
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:35,932
old Cathedral here in Denver,

36
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:37,395
and big Cathedrals always remind her

37
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,926
of her time that she spent in Europe,

38
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:41,843
so she wanted to come check it out.

39
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:47,109
(angelic chanting music)

40
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:12,898
- All right, so we are headed into the

41
00:02:12,898 --> 00:02:16,010
Colorado State Capitol building.

42
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,922
We're excited to check it out.

43
00:02:16,922 --> 00:02:18,630
We've heard that when you go inside,

44
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,708
you can climb up some steps,

45
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,931
and be literally a mile above sea level.

46
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:24,743
So, you can be a mile high
in the mile-high city.

47
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:28,076
Senate, have you ever heard of Senators?

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,181
Yeah, they're part of
the legislative branch

49
00:02:31,181 --> 00:02:32,095
of the government.

50
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:35,163
Let's go look in there,
and see what's in there.

51
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:36,003
Isn't it beautiful?

52
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,122
- You know your kid has
been up most of the night

53
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:39,287
in a car not sleeping,

54
00:02:39,287 --> 00:02:41,704
when you find them like this.

55
00:02:43,392 --> 00:02:46,511
Come on Caleb, we're checking
out the Supreme Court.

56
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:49,151
Aren't you totally interested?

57
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:51,734
- I'm tired.
- We're all tired.

58
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,591
- All right, well we're
literally driving out of town.

59
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,090
The kids are already zonked in the car,

60
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,094
but I wanted to stop and drive by

61
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,619
16th Street Mall and just see what it is,

62
00:02:59,619 --> 00:03:01,524
'cause I'd heard it
was a really cool spot.

63
00:03:01,524 --> 00:03:02,981
When I saw it, I had to get out of the car

64
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:03,814
and look around,

65
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:07,096
so Jeremy's driving one loop
around while I check it out.

66
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:08,313
I love this!

67
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,308
What a cool street in
the middle of a downtown!

68
00:03:10,308 --> 00:03:11,756
This place is awesome!

69
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,493
- Sometimes when Kendra has
only had an hour of sleep,

70
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,470
she busts into song, which just began,

71
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,587
and I told her she had to stop

72
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,617
so that we could share
it with you as well.

73
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:19,866
Okay, go ahead.

74
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,165
- And, go!

75
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:23,052
♫ A long, long time ago

76
00:03:23,052 --> 00:03:24,521
♫ I can still remember

77
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,872
♫ Your daddy and I went
on an inner-tube date

78
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,339
♫ There were tubes in the water

79
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:30,389
♫ When we floated down

80
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:33,405
♫ We were with my family,
and it was a fun time

81
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:37,572
♫ And that's the end of
that sto-o-ry, my dears

82
00:03:39,253 --> 00:03:40,934
I'm lovin' this drive.

83
00:03:40,934 --> 00:03:42,676
There's so much cool stuff to see.

84
00:03:42,676 --> 00:03:45,380
Better keep my eyes on the road.

85
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,154
Hey, guys, we're comin' up to a tunnel!

86
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:48,804
Do you guys want to hold your breath

87
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:51,653
during the tunnel with me?

88
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:52,986
Okay, ready, go.

89
00:03:54,876 --> 00:03:55,709
(sighs)

90
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:56,993
(laughs)

91
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:58,941
- You go over the middle line here,

92
00:03:58,941 --> 00:04:02,310
there's a bumpity-bump so
that it makes a loud noise.

93
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,030
- Even if you barely
touch the middle line.

94
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,453
- [Jeremy] Yeah, not like you're
being completely dangerous

95
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,239
or a bad driver.

96
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,465
- You have to understand,
it happens a few times

97
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:11,440
when you're driving for like, 12 hours,

98
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,611
and you're on roads where
there's like, nobody.

99
00:04:13,611 --> 00:04:15,273
- Anyway, so every time she's done it,

100
00:04:15,273 --> 00:04:17,317
Elise has come up with a name for it,

101
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:18,149
it's pretty funny.

102
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:19,244
(tire bumping noises)

103
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:20,750
What's that, Elise?

104
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,250
- A car fluffer.
- Car fluffer!

105
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:26,467
So, next time that happens,

106
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:28,224
know it's a car fluffer.

107
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,985
- Which, thankfully, Elise
did clarify, doesn't smell.

108
00:04:30,985 --> 00:04:33,523
There's no smell associated with it.

109
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,048
- [Jeremy] There's my mom!

110
00:04:36,048 --> 00:04:37,180
There she is!

111
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,760
She's bringin' us in.

112
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,758
- [Kendra] The party is starting!

113
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:43,237
- [Jeremy] There they are!

114
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:45,207
You guys excited?

115
00:04:45,207 --> 00:04:46,760
Go see 'em!

116
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,159
- I love you, muah.

117
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,644
Good to see, you.

118
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:52,591
(excited chatter)

119
00:04:52,591 --> 00:04:53,451
- All right, so we're here,

120
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:54,945
and the party has officially begun.

121
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:55,981
We are hitting the trails,

122
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,614
and we're gonna go see Fish Creek Falls.

123
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:01,281
I think that's what it's called.

124
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,156
(techno music)

125
00:05:08,156 --> 00:05:08,989
- What's your thoughts about it?

126
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,038
- I'm fun.

127
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,788
- Isn't it fun?
- No.

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,592
- We're gonna go to a water fall.

129
00:05:15,592 --> 00:05:16,425
- No.
- No?

130
00:05:19,732 --> 00:05:21,176
- [Jeremy] Where are we going, cubby?

131
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:24,806
- To the water fall!
- To the water fall!

132
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,239
You see it, Caleb, look!

133
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:29,822
(upbeat music)

134
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:46,470
He's doin' it, he's sittin'
in it, he's ridin' it.

135
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:49,387
(excited mumbling)

136
00:05:51,994 --> 00:05:53,744
Are you in the water?

137
00:06:08,062 --> 00:06:09,915
- [Kendra] Isaac, did you climb up there?

138
00:06:09,915 --> 00:06:11,147
Or did they put you up there?

139
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,480
- No, he climbed.
- Serious?

140
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:17,601
Are you a mountain goat?

141
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,836
All right, well we are
driving up the last windy road

142
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,748
on the way to the vacation house.

143
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,960
- Look how beautiful
this is, look at this!

144
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,293
- This is where we're staying!

145
00:06:26,293 --> 00:06:28,408
Anyway, we are almost there.

146
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:29,808
All 35 of us are going to be staying

147
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,620
in the same house this week.

148
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,638
So it's gonna be an adventure, for sure.

149
00:06:33,638 --> 00:06:34,611
We're gonna show you the front,

150
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,821
and come back tomorrow,

151
00:06:35,821 --> 00:06:37,236
and we'll give you a whole house tour.

152
00:06:37,236 --> 00:06:38,949
All right, so we are pulling up.

153
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:40,949
There's the lodge, whoo!

154
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,441
- [Together] J-house out!

155
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:48,191
- J-house out, wa-ha!

156
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:53,002
(light techno music)

157
00:06:53,002 --> 00:06:53,912
- Woo-hoo!
- Hello!

158
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,079
- J-House out!

159
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:58,617
- [Together] We're Meg and Em,

160
00:06:58,617 --> 00:06:59,942
and we're saying, J-house out!

161
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:02,520
- [Jeremy] Isaac, why do you think America

162
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,035
wanted to be independent from England?

163
00:07:05,035 --> 00:00:00,000
- Because they have a different accent.
