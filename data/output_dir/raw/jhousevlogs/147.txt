1
00:00:00,178 --> 00:00:03,261
(accelerating music)

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:08,249
(crickets chirping)

3
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:09,145
- [Jeremy] Good morning.

4
00:00:09,145 --> 00:00:10,922
So it's funny how it gets darker earlier

5
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:12,729
in the morning as we move into fall

6
00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:13,944
and towards winter.

7
00:00:13,944 --> 00:00:17,305
It just feels earlier and
more painful to get up.

8
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,400
In our family, Janae
and Laura are typically

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,807
the first ones up.

10
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:21,640
Let us know in the poll,

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,473
how about for you?

12
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:24,227
Are you the first one in your family

13
00:00:24,227 --> 00:00:26,227
or do you wake up later?

14
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:35,159
What do you want to eat

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,639
for breakfast this morning, big girl?

16
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:39,002
- I want to eat cereal.

17
00:00:39,002 --> 00:00:39,986
- [Jeremy] Cereal?

18
00:00:39,986 --> 00:00:42,486
Alright, let's do it, come on.

19
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:49,668
(sneezes)

20
00:00:49,668 --> 00:00:51,418
Bless you, bless you.

21
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:57,434
â™« I wish I could be perfect daughter

22
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:02,232
â™« But come back to the water

23
00:01:02,232 --> 00:01:06,890
â™« See the night in the
light of the sea sea sea

24
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,992
â™« Hi me

25
00:01:08,992 --> 00:01:09,992
- I spilled.

26
00:01:11,373 --> 00:01:13,355
- [Jeremy] How did that happen?

27
00:01:13,355 --> 00:01:17,494
- I was pouring it, when I
put my arm in and it spilled.

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,297
- [Jeremy] Alright, let's clean it up.

29
00:01:19,297 --> 00:01:22,275
(uptempo music)

30
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,565
(Janae squealing)

31
00:01:23,565 --> 00:01:25,635
- So we have a bunch of
laundry to fold this morning.

32
00:01:25,635 --> 00:01:27,612
Some of the laundry is
because I just went through

33
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:29,245
the growing box for Janae,

34
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,940
and got out a bunch of the new
clothes she's growing into,

35
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,584
and we're washing those and folding those.

36
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:34,968
But as I'm folding,

37
00:01:34,968 --> 00:01:36,268
she's crawling around me

38
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:40,018
and she is going from
crawling to sitting up.

39
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:43,503
You gotta decide which way.

40
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:46,015
Oh you're coming this way.

41
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:48,015
Oh, back to the sitting.

42
00:01:49,015 --> 00:01:51,015
Come on, come over here.

43
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:57,026
She's coming.

44
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,262
She's coming, oh, you
almost got that foot out.

45
00:02:03,262 --> 00:02:04,733
Yeah.

46
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:05,566
(laughing)

47
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,399
Yeah.

48
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,981
Come this way.

49
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:13,711
Come on, Caleb's over this way,

50
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:14,544
He's the cool one.

51
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:15,877
Yes, you did it.

52
00:02:17,591 --> 00:02:19,308
You did it.

53
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:20,808
- [Caleb] Come on.

54
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:23,233
- [Kendra] Are you doing it?

55
00:02:23,233 --> 00:02:24,483
Oh, you did it!

56
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,361
- Ready go.

57
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:38,028
(piano playing)

58
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:42,779
- So Anne Michelle is
such a good piano teacher.

59
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:44,417
She found curriculum

60
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:48,153
that is related to Elise having dyslexia.

61
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:49,945
I thought that was really awesome.

62
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:51,403
- Dun da!

63
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:52,236
- Yay!

64
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,069
(clapping)

65
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:53,902
- High five.

66
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:55,245
- Woo!
- Good job.

67
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:56,541
- For lunch today,
we're basically cleaning

68
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:58,418
out the fridge and all
eating different leftovers.

69
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:00,425
And it's so hard for me sometimes

70
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:01,433
to finish leftovers.

71
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,823
Like they get stuck in
the back of the fridge

72
00:03:02,823 --> 00:03:03,708
and then we end up throwing them away,

73
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,541
but that's wasteful,

74
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,036
so I'm trying really hard

75
00:03:06,036 --> 00:03:08,746
and we are eating all of our leftovers.

76
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:10,082
Waste not, want not.

77
00:03:10,082 --> 00:03:11,534
- [Jeremy] What are you guys doing?

78
00:03:11,534 --> 00:03:13,621
- We're raking.
- We're raking.

79
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,621
(bluesy rock music)

80
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:29,979
- [Jeremy] We'll have
to get the leaf blower

81
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,670
out here soon too.

82
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,695
Do you remember that?

83
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,528
- Yeah.

84
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:35,802
- When we made one big pile over there.

85
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:36,635
- [Jeremy] That was really funny.

86
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:37,912
- That was two or three years ago.

87
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:39,414
- Three years ago.
- Remember when we built like

88
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:41,769
- this humongous pile,

89
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:44,000
and then you blew it on us.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,232
- [Jeremy] You were still in a diaper,

91
00:03:46,232 --> 00:03:48,961
you were just two years old.

92
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:51,961
(sweet piano music)

93
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:03,773
(leaf blower whirring)

94
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:05,940
(yelling)

95
00:04:09,051 --> 00:04:11,095
(laughing)

96
00:04:11,095 --> 00:04:12,840
- One, two three, waaa!

97
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,757
- [Kendra] Let's make a leaf angel.

98
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:17,689
(yelling)

99
00:04:17,689 --> 00:04:20,646
(Kendra laughing)

100
00:04:20,646 --> 00:04:21,729
- Three ahhh!

101
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:24,134
(leaf blower whirring)

102
00:04:24,134 --> 00:04:25,413
(yelling)

103
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:28,996
(majestic classical music)

104
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,917
- I started this game this morning

105
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,039
with Dad and we've just been playing this

106
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,540
through the day.

107
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,731
- Unfortunately Laura
moved one of the pieces.

108
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,564
- [Jeremy] Did she?

109
00:04:40,564 --> 00:04:41,481
- I don't know which one though.

110
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,314
- I moved it back.

111
00:04:42,314 --> 00:04:43,440
- [Kendra] Okay good.

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,940
- It was the king.

113
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,321
(Jeremy laughs)

114
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,330
- We'll have to see who wins.

115
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,848
- I think I might win

116
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:51,790
for the first time
because I got a chess book

117
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,764
from the library.

118
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,843
- [Jeremy] You've been
studying up on what to do?

119
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,093
- [Isaac] Yeah.

120
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:01,017
- It's getting intense.

121
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:01,934
Check mate.

122
00:05:03,905 --> 00:05:04,785
Alright, you're gonna
have to read the book

123
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:06,553
a little bit more.

124
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:08,332
And let's keep playing, okay?

125
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,612
What do you think you
did wrong on this one?

126
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:11,898
- I went too aggressive.

127
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:12,985
- [Jeremy] Too aggressive, too fast,

128
00:05:12,985 --> 00:05:15,400
you got to think through the moves.

129
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,096
- [Kendra] So Janae is starting to drink

130
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:18,679
out of a sippy cup.

131
00:05:20,384 --> 00:05:21,336
(laughing)

132
00:05:21,336 --> 00:05:23,586
She grins while she's doing

133
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:27,517
- [Caleb] Do you want a
hug from your big brother?

134
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,517
- You want to hug Cubby?

135
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:31,468
(screaming)

136
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:33,420
- I want more water.

137
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,330
(laughing)

138
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,769
- [Kendra] Now is not the time.

139
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,564
The sippy cup is fun.

140
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:41,221
(laughing)

141
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,054
It's fun.

142
00:05:44,858 --> 00:05:46,108
She is so cute.

143
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,729
(laughing)

144
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:57,089
- So Caleb just barely
wrote a new lullaby.

145
00:05:57,089 --> 00:05:58,644
I want to share it with you guys.

146
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,720
You want to show us Cub?

147
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,387
(piano playing)

148
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:15,903
That's so pretty, how did
you come up with the song?

149
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:18,640
- So at first, I looked at one

150
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,557
that actually was almost
exactly like that one.

151
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,111
- [Jeremy] Very similar.

152
00:06:26,111 --> 00:06:28,796
- It's actually the exact same thing.

153
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:29,655
- [Jeremy] Oh.

154
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:32,999
(piano playing)

155
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:34,008
So you didn't make up a song,

156
00:06:34,008 --> 00:06:36,869
this is just one of your songs.

157
00:06:36,869 --> 00:06:38,333
- But I made up this.

158
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:41,666
(uptempo piano playing)

159
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:50,077
Where are you guys heading?

160
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,634
- Gymnastics.

161
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:52,882
- Have fun.
- Woo!

162
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:54,643
- So these kids are heading to gymnastics,

163
00:06:54,643 --> 00:06:57,031
I'm taking Isaac to his soccer practice.

164
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:58,683
Who are those cute people?

165
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,073
You going to gymnastics?

166
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:00,906
- Yes.

167
00:07:00,906 --> 00:07:01,936
- [Jeremy] Have fun.

168
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:02,769
- Bye!

169
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:05,986
- I think we're both gonna
be about three minutes late,

170
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,850
but we're really close.

171
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,073
You're gonna be on time?

172
00:07:09,073 --> 00:07:10,491
We might make it on time.

173
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,488
Bye.

174
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:12,651
- Bye!

175
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:14,120
- Bye!

176
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,787
(uptempo music)

177
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,945
- So the gym is doing a fundraiser today,

178
00:07:20,945 --> 00:07:22,754
where they're selling old leotards

179
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:24,810
and the girls were both so excited

180
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,826
when they came in and saw all the leotards

181
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:28,338
and they're really cute.

182
00:07:28,338 --> 00:07:29,384
I would like to get one,

183
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,952
but they are only selling
them for cash or check,

184
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:34,118
and I do not have cash or check on me.

185
00:07:34,118 --> 00:07:34,951
Bummer.

186
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:36,803
This one's cute.

187
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:40,386
(uptempo electronic music)

188
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:00,311
(atmospheric music)

189
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:05,736
- [Jeremy] How was soccer practice?

190
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:06,569
- Good.

191
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,997
I was about to drink this,

192
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:11,572
and I realized it wasn't screwed up.

193
00:08:11,572 --> 00:08:13,179
- [Jeremy] You're a little wet.

194
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:14,627
- Just a little bit.

195
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:15,659
- [Jeremy] Whose right behind us?

196
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:17,760
That's Mom and the kids.

197
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,678
We're at the exact same intersection

198
00:08:19,678 --> 00:08:21,595
that we were at before.

199
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,767
How was gymnastics?

200
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:27,942
- Good.

201
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:28,775
- Good!

202
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,646
- [Jeremy] Did you have fun?

203
00:08:30,646 --> 00:08:32,477
- Her, Lise's tooth fell out.

204
00:08:32,477 --> 00:08:34,063
- [Jeremy] Your tooth fell out?

205
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,019
- It's a joke, she's teasing us.

206
00:08:36,019 --> 00:08:37,265
- [Jeremy] I thought you were serious.

207
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:39,472
It's just a piece of the sucker stick?

208
00:08:39,472 --> 00:08:40,305
- Yeah.

209
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,225
- [Jeremy] How did Nae Nae do?

210
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:43,058
- [Laura] Good.

211
00:08:43,058 --> 00:08:46,009
(violin picking)

212
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,533
- [Instructor] So let the fingers stay

213
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,127
just barely above the string.

214
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:50,127
There we go.

215
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,833
- [Caleb] Good night, J House out.

216
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:56,688
- And that's what we need to be strong.

217
00:08:56,688 --> 00:08:58,712
- I just want the floor to be safe

218
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:03,075
for me to explore and um,
I spit up, that's all.

219
00:09:03,075 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
