1
00:00:00,499 --> 00:00:03,464
- Isaac, I have a very
good piece of advice.

2
00:00:03,464 --> 00:00:04,820
Don't listen to your dad.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:07,820
(lively rock music)

4
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:11,485
- [Kendra] Woo!

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:15,431
That is the cutest thing ever.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,268
Caleb and I are working
on his blanket today.

7
00:00:21,268 --> 00:00:22,227
He's helping me iron

8
00:00:22,227 --> 00:00:24,268
under very close supervision.

9
00:00:24,268 --> 00:00:26,133
Did you get me more water for the iron?

10
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:27,560
Thanks bud, I'll hold it steady.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,977
Okay that's good.

12
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,219
Good job buddy.

13
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,177
- I did mostly every spot.

14
00:00:35,177 --> 00:00:36,984
- [Kendra] We're working
together, aren't we?

15
00:00:36,984 --> 00:00:37,817
- Woo!

16
00:00:37,817 --> 00:00:39,919
- By the way I am terrified of irons

17
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:41,573
and getting burnt or other
people getting burnt,

18
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,879
so I would never let
him do this on his own.

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,271
I'm right here with him.

20
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:47,536
We're doing it together.

21
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:48,568
We're being safe.

22
00:00:48,568 --> 00:00:51,818
(uptempo bright music)

23
00:01:07,624 --> 00:01:11,247
- [Kendra] Caleb's helping me
straighten out all the edges

24
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:12,515
and pin it.

25
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,165
Be careful.
- That's good.

26
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,947
- [Kendra] Good work.

27
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:16,780
- [Caleb] One right here.

28
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,814
- [Kendra] We are almost done.

29
00:01:18,814 --> 00:01:21,711
So here's some of Caleb's sewing.

30
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:23,039
Line it up straight.

31
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:26,539
(sewing machine whirring)

32
00:01:30,512 --> 00:01:32,095
- I just tried like

33
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,879
- [Kendra] Are you turning it inside out?

34
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:37,207
It's fun, because you get to start seeing

35
00:01:37,207 --> 00:01:38,672
what it's gonna look like.

36
00:01:38,672 --> 00:01:40,840
I love the football fabric dude.

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,744
You made that.

38
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:44,799
- Now I need to iron it one more time

39
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,216
and sew it again.

40
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:48,593
- [Kendra] Then we'll be done.

41
00:01:48,593 --> 00:01:49,744
What are you working on?

42
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:51,856
- Lunch, pasta salad.

43
00:01:51,856 --> 00:01:53,109
- [Kendra] What's this?

44
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:55,217
- The seasoning basically.

45
00:01:55,217 --> 00:01:56,087
- [Kendra] The sauce?

46
00:01:56,087 --> 00:01:59,137
- Or like, you know, when
you're making mac and cheese.

47
00:01:59,137 --> 00:01:59,970
- [Kendra] The sauce?

48
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,803
- Yeah the sauce.

49
00:02:00,803 --> 00:02:03,220
- Yeah it smells really good.

50
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,369
- [Kendra] Cooking the noodles.

51
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,937
Alright so we're having pasta salad

52
00:02:07,937 --> 00:02:08,876
and apples for lunch.

53
00:02:08,876 --> 00:02:10,326
How do you guys like it?

54
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:11,159
- Good.
- Good.

55
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,492
- I made it.

56
00:02:12,492 --> 00:02:14,121
- [Kendra] I know we saw you made it.

57
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:15,199
- And chicken.

58
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,312
- [Kendra] It's got chicken in it, huh?

59
00:02:16,312 --> 00:02:17,451
Rotisserie chicken?

60
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:19,720
- And we can choose
how much we want in it.

61
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,301
- Hey Laura, how's the pasta salad?

62
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,134
- Great.

63
00:02:22,134 --> 00:02:23,509
- These are so good with it.

64
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:24,342
- [Kendra] Yeah they are.

65
00:02:24,342 --> 00:02:25,658
- Having lunch with Jared.

66
00:02:25,658 --> 00:02:26,948
- Hey how's it going?

67
00:02:26,948 --> 00:02:28,532
This is like crazy.

68
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:29,648
We just met Gary.

69
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:30,914
- Yeah.

70
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:31,747
It was fun to meet him.

71
00:02:31,747 --> 00:02:33,183
- It was a lot of fun.

72
00:02:33,183 --> 00:02:34,016
I'm so glad you're here,

73
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,359
I have so much to tell you this time.

74
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:36,922
- This is the best part
of every conference

75
00:02:36,922 --> 00:02:38,705
is hanging out with friends

76
00:02:38,705 --> 00:02:39,647
that we don't get to see all the time.

77
00:02:39,647 --> 00:02:40,480
- Yeah really.

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,922
- One, I've completely
given up on getting ready

79
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:43,848
for today, and Caleb has decided

80
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:46,264
that he prefers the hand wheel.

81
00:02:46,264 --> 00:02:47,843
Is it just easier?

82
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:49,566
We are almost done with his blanket.

83
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:50,497
Alright, here's the baby blankets

84
00:02:50,497 --> 00:02:53,266
that we've already finished.

85
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,898
- This one is Elise's
and this one is yours,

86
00:02:55,898 --> 00:02:59,779
and this one's Caleb's
and this one is mine.

87
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:03,446
- [Kendra] Yeah, we
just need to do Isaac's.

88
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,302
Can you pile 'em up?

89
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:10,802
- Yep, first mine.

90
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:15,296
- [Kendra] This girl has the
cutest little yoga stances.

91
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:16,732
That one was good.

92
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:18,450
She hears the kids.

93
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:20,377
Somebody's trying to escape.

94
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:21,978
(suspenseful music)

95
00:03:21,978 --> 00:03:25,978
She's trying to figure
out how to navigate this.

96
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:30,018
Are you coming outside?

97
00:03:30,018 --> 00:03:31,467
You did it.

98
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,001
And you found a ladybug.

99
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,022
You should probably
leave the ladybug alone.

100
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:36,597
She's only seven months old.

101
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:39,561
We are so in trouble, like
the way she moves around

102
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,810
and she just has so much
control over her body,

103
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,136
she's gonna be such a busy little girl.

104
00:03:44,136 --> 00:03:45,924
Is this what you wanted
to come outside for?

105
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:48,424
Look at 'em, they're all here.

106
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:52,261
(playful music)

107
00:03:53,883 --> 00:03:55,623
- My name is Ariel.

108
00:03:55,623 --> 00:03:57,044
- [Kendra] Your name is Ariel?

109
00:03:57,044 --> 00:03:58,641
- You want to see my handspring?

110
00:03:58,641 --> 00:03:59,974
- [Kendra] Sure.

111
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:02,777
Woo!

112
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:05,128
- Stay focused.

113
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:07,128
- [Kendra] Stay focused.

114
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:10,634
Woo, you got it girl.

115
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:13,923
Whoa, the belly flop.

116
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:15,673
I'm glad you focused.

117
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:18,978
Woo!

118
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:21,636
Your name is Ariel, so you're swimming?

119
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:22,511
That makes sense.

120
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:24,817
- It's kind of hard, because
of the stuff on the ground.

121
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:26,669
- Yeah, let's show 'em
the stuff on the ground.

122
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,323
So we actually had our lawn aerated today.

123
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,251
- [Elise] What does that mean?

124
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:32,846
- I think it helps the yard,

125
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:35,043
because it gets the air down into it more.

126
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:36,028
Like that's why it's called aeration,

127
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,165
I have no idea if that's right or not.

128
00:04:37,165 --> 00:04:38,430
If you know what aeration is

129
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,036
and why we do it, leave that information

130
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:42,300
in the comments below.

131
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,883
(lively music)

132
00:04:48,173 --> 00:04:50,423
(laughing)

133
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,584
Whoa, good catch Cubby.

134
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,147
Two hand touch, you guys are tough.

135
00:04:58,147 --> 00:05:01,564
- One time we were practicing and it went

136
00:05:03,051 --> 00:05:04,341
- [Kendra] Oh did it hurt?

137
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,366
- Yeah, it kinda did.

138
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,399
I cried for two milliseconds,

139
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,099
then I stopped

140
00:05:10,099 --> 00:05:11,081
and kept on playing.
- Nice.

141
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:12,838
- [Kendra] Elise, what did you make?

142
00:05:12,838 --> 00:05:14,283
- A leaf skirt.

143
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:16,513
- [Kendra] I love it.

144
00:05:16,513 --> 00:05:19,013
That is the cutest thing ever.

145
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,525
(growling)

146
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:25,270
Janae liked it doing it agan.

147
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,448
My ear fell off.

148
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:27,705
- [Kendra] Your ear?

149
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:28,711
Your ear fell out?

150
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:29,662
- Someone took it.

151
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,558
- [Kendra] No, it fell somewhere.

152
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:32,808
It disappeared.

153
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:37,058
- It's on your shoulder.

154
00:05:37,058 --> 00:05:38,565
- [Kendra] Good find, Laura Lu.

155
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:40,686
(tender music)

156
00:05:40,686 --> 00:05:42,119
Thank you Laura.

157
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,004
- You're welcome.

158
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:45,498
- So I'm over there stirring
dinner and Janae's squawking,

159
00:05:45,498 --> 00:05:47,456
I'm coming, I'm coming
Janae, and all of a sudden

160
00:05:47,456 --> 00:05:48,621
she's quiet, and I turn around,

161
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:50,234
and Laura had come in from outside,

162
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,437
and was feeding her, I just
thought that was so sweet

163
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:53,402
that she noticed her need

164
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,163
and was taking care of her little sister.

165
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:56,480
We love you.

166
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,736
- So I'm getting to do
a one on one sit down

167
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,465
with Gary V to talk about the industry.

168
00:06:01,465 --> 00:06:02,936
How cool is that?

169
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:05,936
(groovy beat music)

170
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,425
- Alright, he's a nine year old,

171
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:12,560
entrepreneur at heart,

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,591
he's always talking about
how someday he wants

173
00:06:13,591 --> 00:06:16,262
to buy a sports franchise

174
00:06:16,262 --> 00:06:18,053
or build these things
and he's drawing things.

175
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:18,950
- I love you Isaac.

176
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:20,933
- What advice for Isaac would you give

177
00:06:20,933 --> 00:06:22,554
as a budding entrepreneur.

178
00:06:22,554 --> 00:06:23,387
Oh and real quick, Isaac,

179
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:26,682
this is like one of the
world's greatest entrepreneurs

180
00:06:26,682 --> 00:06:28,005
so listen up.

181
00:06:28,005 --> 00:06:30,422
(bell dings)

182
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:34,667
- Isaac, I have a very
good piece of advice.

183
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,427
Don't listen to your dad.

184
00:06:36,427 --> 00:06:37,260
(laughing)

185
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,995
- Alright let's hold off

186
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:42,110
- Isaac on a serious kick,
here's what I actually mean.

187
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,086
Entrepreneurship is very hard, my man.

188
00:06:44,086 --> 00:06:45,136
And I hope you watch this today

189
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,149
and I hope you watch this in 10 years,

190
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:48,496
and I hope you it in 20
and 30 and 40 and 50,

191
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:50,731
but I'm making a joke,

192
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:51,564
'cause you should listen to your dad

193
00:06:51,564 --> 00:06:52,494
and your dad's a good guy,

194
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:53,679
but I'm kind of not,

195
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:56,031
because entrepreneurship is lonely.

196
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:59,266
Following your intuition
is unbelievably important.

197
00:06:59,266 --> 00:07:01,328
And as long as you're
not hurting anybody else,

198
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:04,505
it's an awfully good
way to live your life,

199
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:07,834
a.k.a., build the biggest building in town

200
00:07:07,834 --> 00:07:09,131
by building the biggest building,

201
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:11,758
not by tearing everybody
else's buildings down.

202
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:14,432
You follow that road-map,
you'll win, brother.

203
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,018
- And to all those other
entrepreneurs out there,

204
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,752
check out Gary V in the description box

205
00:07:17,752 --> 00:07:18,585
below we'll have for you.

206
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:19,418
Thank you, I appreciate it.

207
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:20,251
- Thanks.

208
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:24,653
- Thanks for coming to
VidSummit, what did you think?

209
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,070
- They've found a basketball.

210
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,977
I wanted to tell you real quickly

211
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:33,591
about something that I've been doing

212
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:36,159
different today and it's
made a really big difference.

213
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,106
Before Jeremy left on his trip,

214
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,783
he told me about this marriage
book that he was reading.

215
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,984
And it talked about not
criticizing each other,

216
00:07:41,984 --> 00:07:43,435
which is obviously good advice,

217
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,240
but it says something specific to do

218
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,582
when you feel inclined to criticize.

219
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:48,968
It said instead of criticizing,

220
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,638
replace it with the words, I wish.

221
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,396
And so instead of saying
the negative like,

222
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:56,068
oh my goodness, why do you always leave

223
00:07:56,068 --> 00:07:57,751
your socks on the floor,

224
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,076
you replace it with the positive.

225
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,086
Like I wish that we could work harder

226
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:01,199
to keep our room clean together

227
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,098
or something like that,

228
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:03,557
but that's not a great example,

229
00:08:03,557 --> 00:08:05,726
because Jeremy doesn't even
leave his socks on the floor.

230
00:08:05,726 --> 00:08:08,312
But I've been trying to do
this with the kids today

231
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:10,517
and it's made a really big difference.

232
00:08:10,517 --> 00:08:12,335
It's amazing how just a positive tone,

233
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:14,602
like say things like, I wish
we could speak more kindly

234
00:08:14,602 --> 00:08:16,722
to each other, or I wish
we could stay in our seats

235
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:18,541
at the breakfast table.

236
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,375
They respond so kindly to it.

237
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,850
You know it's the little things,

238
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,406
and it's sometimes hard
to remember to do that.

239
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:24,989
So I've been really working on that today

240
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:27,525
and I've been really
happy with the results.

241
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,221
I feel like it's affected
the feeling in our home.

242
00:08:30,221 --> 00:08:31,491
So I also told the kids this morning

243
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,000
all day long we were gonna play a game,

244
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,379
where I was gonna try to catch them

245
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,707
doing good things, and
it's been really fun,

246
00:08:36,707 --> 00:08:38,674
like I'm like, oh I
caught you doing something

247
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:40,182
nice to your brother, oh,

248
00:08:40,182 --> 00:08:41,515
I caught you encouraging each other,

249
00:08:41,515 --> 00:08:43,164
oh I caught you doing
that with a good attitude.

250
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:45,747
(bright music)

251
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:53,723
(lively rock music)

252
00:08:58,451 --> 00:08:59,828
- So it's so sad, we're here with a bunch

253
00:08:59,828 --> 00:09:04,580
of creators at the racetrack
and I feel terrible,

254
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,251
like I didn't sleep enough last night,

255
00:09:06,251 --> 00:09:07,388
I haven't eaten enough,

256
00:09:07,388 --> 00:09:09,106
I haven't drank enough.

257
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:11,172
And so I'm just heading
back the the airport to

258
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:12,553
to the airport, I'm
heading back to the hotel

259
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,080
to head to bed.

260
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,056
J House out.

261
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,857
- [Kendra] Laura wants to try the blanket.

262
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,153
(laughing)

263
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:20,489
- I'll be back in a few days.

264
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:24,079
- Nobody makes Play Doh, but God does.

265
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,152
- [Kendra] Oh he does?

266
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,641
- They are our best friends.

267
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:29,277
- [Kendra] You guys are gonna
be on the five o'clock news?

268
00:09:29,277 --> 00:00:00,000
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.
