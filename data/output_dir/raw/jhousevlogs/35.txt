1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
(singing, drumming)

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:05,840
- [Kendra] Thanks for helping, Elise.

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,903
How's it going, dude?

4
00:00:07,903 --> 00:00:10,736
(energetic music)

5
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:21,026
- We sleep in our costumes, right, Caleb?

6
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:21,859
- [Caleb] Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:23,452
- But not in your blanket, right?

8
00:00:23,452 --> 00:00:25,052
- Mnm-hmn.

9
00:00:25,052 --> 00:00:27,885
(Janae vocalizes)

10
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:30,984
- [Child] Hi, little boy.

11
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,490
- [Jeremy] She likes tapping it.

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,460
(children giggle)

13
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:39,354
- So today is our last
full day here in San Diego,

14
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:41,737
and I am so sad about it,
I feel like I'm leaving

15
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:44,044
a little piece of my
heart behind in the city

16
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,872
and in this house, it's just been a really

17
00:00:45,872 --> 00:00:48,451
special and wonderful trip for our family.

18
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:52,415
So, we're doing our best to
fill today with wonderfulness,

19
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:55,290
I'm starting off the morning
with a walk with my big kids.

20
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,865
You guys enjoying the tree this morning?

21
00:00:56,865 --> 00:00:57,980
- [Kids] Yeah.

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:58,813
- [Kendra] Do you wanna get down

23
00:00:58,813 --> 00:00:59,646
and go on a quick walk with me?

24
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:00,550
- [Isaac] No.
- [Elise] Sure!

25
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,659
- [Kendra] Isaac doesn't
want to go on the walk,

26
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:04,240
he just wants to stay in the tree forever.

27
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,290
So my goal for today is to
stay outside all day long.

28
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,123
See if that works.

29
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:11,956
Let's go.

30
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:14,742
- One, two, ready, go!

31
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,242
- A B C D E F G...

32
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:20,107
H I J K L M N O P.

33
00:01:21,838 --> 00:01:22,671
(drumming)

34
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:27,671
♪ Try to make friends when
you don't have much friends ♪

35
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:30,307
♪ Even though when you don't have much ♪

36
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:33,427
♪ Friends, you should have much ♪

37
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,650
♪ Try and make a friend ♪

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,900
♪ Try to make a friend ♪

39
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:43,529
- So what kind of bowl is this?

40
00:01:43,529 --> 00:01:44,362
- [Kendra] It's a pitaya bowl.

41
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:47,080
- Pitaya bowl, it's so pretty.

42
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,610
- [Kendra] It is, it's really gorgeous.

43
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,443
- It's really good.

44
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,140
- [Kendra] I think pitaya,
it's a dragonfruit I think?

45
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,190
Oh, I might be wrong.

46
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,090
So we're having one last acai bowl. Yum!

47
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,025
This one's called a Lotta
Beta, so it's got beets in it,

48
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,640
and spinach and all sorts of goodness.

49
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,120
- Beets taste like candy to me.

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:07,953
- [Kendra] Do they?
- Uh-huh.

51
00:02:07,953 --> 00:02:09,437
- [Kendra] Yours has beets
in it, too, do you like it?

52
00:02:09,437 --> 00:02:10,270
- [Elise] Uh-huh.

53
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,104
- [Kendra] You like it buddy?

54
00:02:11,104 --> 00:02:11,937
- Uh-huh.

55
00:02:14,295 --> 00:02:17,378
(funky twangy music)

56
00:02:30,556 --> 00:02:31,960
- [Kendra] Magnetic!

57
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,120
- [Demonstrator] So even our sand,

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,560
if you look at our sand here.

59
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,720
- [Jeremy] The sand is picked up.

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,573
- It's got magnetite in it,
so it picks up the magnetite.

61
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,460
- The magnetite, that's amazing.

62
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,744
- So we're spending some time this morning

63
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,670
at the Torrey Pines Nature Reserve.

64
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,900
They have some beautiful hikes and views.

65
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:51,851
Oh, head down.

66
00:02:53,844 --> 00:02:56,511
(relaxed music)

67
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:16,187
Anytime I'm on a hike,
it's my natural feeling

68
00:03:16,187 --> 00:03:18,466
to try to run to the end.

69
00:03:18,466 --> 00:03:20,073
Kendra does a better job of, like,

70
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:22,200
looking at each plaque along the way

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,080
and talking about the
different plants and animals.

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,646
Yeah, I need to do better
at enjoying the journey

73
00:03:27,646 --> 00:03:29,879
and not just running to a destination.

74
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,510
But it's so fun!

75
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,590
- So Janae will not
keep her hat on at all,

76
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,024
so I'm trying to block her.

77
00:03:35,024 --> 00:03:36,015
- [Jeremy] With the paper.

78
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,169
- With the paper to keep her in the shade.

79
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,002
(energetic music)

80
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,115
- [Kendra] I think my
favorite is looking down

81
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:57,150
at the water and seeing
all the different colors.

82
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,390
- Dad, come on!

83
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,674
- Although we went to
the bathroom right before

84
00:04:03,674 --> 00:04:05,989
we started the hike,
Caleb really has to go,

85
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:08,787
so we're gonna quickly
get back to the bathrooms.

86
00:04:08,787 --> 00:04:11,730
- So this reminds me
of Annie's Canyon Trail

87
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,570
that we hiked earlier in our trip.

88
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,802
Oh, this is gorgeous.

89
00:04:14,802 --> 00:04:17,207
The sandstone is just amazing.

90
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,500
So I just had an interesting
moment with Laura.

91
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,480
She keeps getting really
close to the cactus,

92
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,293
and I said, "Laura, stay
away from the cactus.

93
00:04:23,293 --> 00:04:24,710
"Stay away from the cactus."

94
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:25,543
Over and over again.

95
00:04:25,543 --> 00:04:26,570
Finally, she turns around, she says,

96
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,279
"Mom, what is a cactus?"

97
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,437
And I'm like oh my goodness!

98
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:31,523
I didn't even realize that
she didn't know what that was.

99
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:34,365
So then we stopped, and
I pointed out a cactus,

100
00:04:34,365 --> 00:04:37,040
and we talked about the
needles, and anyway,

101
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,713
it's just funny how sometimes
kids can seem disobedient,

102
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:43,194
but really we just maybe haven't explained

103
00:04:43,194 --> 00:04:45,310
our instructions well enough.

104
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,540
Good job.

105
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,920
Here it is, a Torrey pine.

106
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:51,710
That is amazing.

107
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,199
So apparently, Torrey pines are a special

108
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,624
kind of pine tree that only grow here

109
00:04:55,624 --> 00:04:58,323
and in an island that's off of
Santa Barbara in California.

110
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,641
Their roots grow so shallow and spread out

111
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:02,980
that they're able to capture
moisture from the fog.

112
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,144
So Caleb's trying to
match the different skulls

113
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:07,710
of different local
animals to the pictures.

114
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,430
- [Elise] I think these can go here.

115
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,830
- [Demonstrator] Good job.

116
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,510
And the bobcat only eats animals.

117
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,267
- [Isaac] Oh, so this
one's probably the coyote?

118
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:18,160
And the raccoon probably is here.

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,260
- [Demonstrator] Yeah,
the raccoon will eat--

120
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,093
- [Isaac] There.

121
00:05:20,093 --> 00:05:21,170
- [Demonstrator] Yup, yup, perfect.

122
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,250
- [Kendra] You did it.

123
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,220
So when we first arrived
at Torrey Pines today,

124
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,150
I was nervous because
it was super crowded.

125
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,909
The line to even get to the entrance booth

126
00:05:30,909 --> 00:05:32,940
was like down the road.

127
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,902
It worked out, and we
had a great time hiking.

128
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:39,297
("The Greatest Show" playing on stereo)

129
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,420
- [Jeremy] So it's interesting,
Kendra and I had planned

130
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,769
so many fun things for the kids to do,

131
00:05:42,769 --> 00:05:45,178
but I think what they've enjoyed the most,

132
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,710
or the thing that they
most look forward to

133
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,976
is just being home,
playing around the yard,

134
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:51,233
climbing the tree and playing.

135
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,441
And that makes me really happy,

136
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:55,145
and that's interesting as we
continue to plan adventures

137
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,430
for our family, to always make
sure that there's enough time

138
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,970
for just playing around the house,

139
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,610
playing in the yard, climbing a tree.

140
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,907
- Well, Elise and I came
down to Balboa Park,

141
00:06:02,907 --> 00:06:05,659
there's an organ concert
at the organ pavilion

142
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:08,208
that we're wanting to go
to, and we want to sneak in

143
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,730
to the art museum for just
a minute and check it out.

144
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,632
- I'm excited, 'cause if
we go to the art museum

145
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:17,295
then I can be more inspired
for what art things to do.

146
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,795
(organ music)

147
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:28,714
(applause)

148
00:06:28,714 --> 00:06:31,214
(organ music)

149
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,345
- So this is the largest
outdoor organ in the world,

150
00:06:39,345 --> 00:06:41,366
and that concert was magnificent.

151
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:42,254
Did you enjoy it?

152
00:06:42,254 --> 00:06:43,210
- Mm-hmm!

153
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,030
- It's amazing to me that
when people play the organ,

154
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,440
they play with their hands and their feet

155
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,273
at the same time.

156
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:49,120
That amount of coordination is amazing.

157
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,319
We're going behind the scenes.

158
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,225
- We're gonna get to see the organ!

159
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:53,058
Whoa.

160
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,551
- So this is just the
outside of the organ,

161
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:58,131
there's actually 5,017 pipes that are part

162
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:59,740
of this outdoor organ.

163
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,008
So what did you think of the performance?

164
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:02,290
- It was good.

165
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,170
- [Kendra] What was your favorite part?

166
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,910
- The movie time.

167
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,287
- The movie music? That was fun.

168
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:07,837
I'm so grateful that I have
the chance to come back

169
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:09,495
and explore Balboa Park a little bit more.

170
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,790
I'm glad Leesie came with
me, that was nice of you.

171
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,807
It's just beautiful, I just want to see

172
00:07:13,807 --> 00:07:14,928
all the little spots.

173
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:17,511
(bright music)

174
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,350
Leesie, look, this is Mary Cassatt.

175
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,897
She's an artist that I really like.

176
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:41,633
That is beautiful.

177
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:44,466
(classical music)

178
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,216
That's beautiful.

179
00:07:50,216 --> 00:07:53,049
(classical music)

180
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,840
So it's got layers to it.

181
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,990
So then you can add
back the ones you like.

182
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,915
- The reason I like this
picture is because the grass

183
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:10,898
looks like its waving around in the wind.

184
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:14,220
- It does look like that. It's beautiful.

185
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,290
I think that this one is
my favorite from today.

186
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:21,381
I love the vibrant colors
and the movement of the sky

187
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,765
with the storm, it's awesome.

188
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:26,292
Well, time to go home to
the rest of the family.

189
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:29,240
Tonight, we are meeting some
friends here at Waterfront Park

190
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,440
to eat some dinner and enjoy the view,

191
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,290
and let the kids run around and play.

192
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,173
Hey, guys!

193
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,006
- [Caleb] Hi, Mom.

194
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:42,655
- [Kendra] Hi!

195
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,684
Hi, Leese.

196
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,120
- Hi!

197
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,526
- [Kendra] This climbing
section is awesome!

198
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:50,584
How's it going, dude?

199
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:53,470
Oh my goodness, you are way up there!

200
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,897
- [Caleb] Are you scared?

201
00:08:54,897 --> 00:08:57,560
- [Kendra] Yeah, I'm a little nervous.

202
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,990
Well, I wish that I had come to this park

203
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,125
at the beginning of our
trip so we could come

204
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:01,240
a couple times.

205
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,094
Like, this play features
are so unique here!

206
00:09:04,094 --> 00:09:06,210
And with the fountains
on a hot day would be

207
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,680
so fun to splash around in that.

208
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,777
Looks like we're gonna have
to come back to San Diego.

209
00:09:09,777 --> 00:09:11,867
Did you just climb that whole thing?!

210
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:16,006
- Yeah, I went around there,
and I also did that way

211
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:17,881
and I did that one.

212
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,298
- [Kendra] What?!

213
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,730
- So we're down at the
Waterfront Park with friends,

214
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,461
Chick's Life are some of our friends

215
00:09:28,461 --> 00:09:29,945
we've known for a long time on YouTube,

216
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,890
and Heidi with While They
Were Napping and her family.

217
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,301
And it's just a beautiful
sunset, with this old

218
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,560
pirate-style ship that is beautiful.

219
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:45,210
- And then watch this.

220
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,270
- [Jeremy] He's goin'!

221
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:52,510
Elise really flies down there.

222
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,166
(both laugh)

223
00:09:58,166 --> 00:10:00,582
- Let's go to Daddy, go to Daddy.

224
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:03,999
(pleasant relaxed music)

225
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,701
- [Jeremy] Janae found a dog.

226
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:19,391
So this is Nacho,
Nacho's never really been

227
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:22,372
exposed to babies, so I think
he's about as interested

228
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,030
as she is, like, what is this?

229
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,321
The dog is leaving.

230
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:29,708
She's going for the dog.

231
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:31,901
Elise took a picture at night.

232
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:33,460
It turned out really good!

233
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,529
We're trying to get a picture.

234
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:35,932
- [Man] Come on, we gotta take a picture.

235
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:36,878
- [Woman 1] Oh, you got her?

236
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:39,604
(adults cheering)

237
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,090
- [Kendra] Wow, that's a lot of kids.

238
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,193
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

239
00:10:43,193 --> 00:10:46,130
- My baby just took her first steps.

240
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,713
(bright music)

241
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,037
Come on, do it! Come see Mama!

242
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:57,941
- [Jeremy] You guys!

243
00:10:57,941 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] Ah! She did it!
