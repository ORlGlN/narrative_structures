1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,343
- All of them are beautiful.

2
00:00:03,343 --> 00:00:05,890
- [Caleb] I'm making a house.

3
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,892
(lively big band music)

4
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,936
- [Kendra] What is going on?

5
00:00:11,936 --> 00:00:13,577
- I'm gonna make a pumpkin patch.

6
00:00:13,577 --> 00:00:15,344
I got my first eye done.

7
00:00:15,344 --> 00:00:17,927
- We're ready for the show now!

8
00:00:22,722 --> 00:00:24,314
- [Kendra] Is that clapping your hands?

9
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:25,147
Hi.

10
00:00:25,147 --> 00:00:26,396
(sweet music)

11
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:28,043
Hi.

12
00:00:28,043 --> 00:00:31,203
You're doing it, you're doing it.

13
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,795
(Kendra laughs)

14
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:33,715
Hi.

15
00:00:33,715 --> 00:00:36,798
(funky upbeat music)

16
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:42,197
- Phew, that makes me tired.

17
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:50,995
(rolling wheels)

18
00:00:50,995 --> 00:00:51,882
- [Jeremy] Thanks for doing your chores.

19
00:00:51,882 --> 00:00:52,715
- Yeah.

20
00:00:53,885 --> 00:00:55,344
- [Jeremy] Some screws came out and Caleb

21
00:00:55,344 --> 00:00:57,201
was wanting to put 'em back in.

22
00:00:57,201 --> 00:00:58,581
- Am I going the right way?

23
00:00:58,581 --> 00:00:59,414
- [Jeremy] Righty tighty.

24
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,817
Thanks for taking care of the piano.

25
00:01:00,817 --> 00:01:04,623
- Guys, I'm so happy that
the trampoline is okay.

26
00:01:04,623 --> 00:01:06,518
Yay, can we get a thumbs up on this video

27
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:09,685
that the trampoline is alive and well.

28
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:17,176
Well it looks like Caleb
is doing something cool.

29
00:01:17,176 --> 00:01:19,736
I love seeing him out exploring
in this kind of weather.

30
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,238
Let's go see what he's up to.

31
00:01:21,238 --> 00:01:23,594
(chill twangy music)

32
00:01:23,594 --> 00:01:24,692
How's it going?

33
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:26,922
- I'm making a house.

34
00:01:26,922 --> 00:01:28,463
- [Kendra] You're making a house?

35
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,143
- I'm gonna put four of these down

36
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:32,270
into the ground in a square.

37
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:34,337
Then I'm gonna get more sticks,

38
00:01:34,337 --> 00:01:36,665
and build them up on every side

39
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:40,586
and on the roof, I'll
just set them on the top.

40
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:41,655
- [Kendra] That's a good plan.

41
00:01:41,655 --> 00:01:42,617
What tools are you gonna use?

42
00:01:42,617 --> 00:01:44,455
- Shovel and hammer.

43
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:46,241
- [Kendra] Yeah, that is a big stick.

44
00:01:46,241 --> 00:01:48,291
How big are you wanting this house to be?

45
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,034
Like the size of our house?

46
00:01:50,034 --> 00:01:53,666
You're gonna build like a
three bedroom, three bathroom.

47
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:56,445
- It's gonna basically be for only me.

48
00:01:56,445 --> 00:01:57,550
- [Kendra] Okay.

49
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,803
- So one bedroom, I'll
make my own king-sized bed.

50
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:02,636
- [Kendra] Nice.

51
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,747
Maybe I can come out and
sleep out here with you?

52
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:05,723
- Yeah.

53
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:06,586
- That'll be fun.

54
00:02:06,586 --> 00:02:08,095
You're working hard, good job buddy.

55
00:02:08,095 --> 00:02:10,210
- This one is gonna take me a few hours.

56
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,377
I'm gonna be working on
it as long as I can today.

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,381
I just need another stick,

58
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:18,644
like this one.

59
00:02:18,644 --> 00:02:19,807
- [Kendra] Alright,
well I'm excited to see

60
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:22,016
what you come up with buddy.

61
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,724
♫ I adore you

62
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,057
♫ Tiny baby

63
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:30,068
♫ I adore you

64
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,624
- [Jeremy] Are you singing to Janae?

65
00:02:31,624 --> 00:02:32,457
- Mmm-mmm.

66
00:02:32,457 --> 00:02:35,144
- [Jeremy] She's so tired, I
think she's gonna go to sleep.

67
00:02:35,144 --> 00:02:36,408
- (whispers) She fell asleep.

68
00:02:36,408 --> 00:02:37,497
- Kendra and I a lot of times feel like

69
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,244
we don't have any time to do things

70
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,656
that are important or
that we want to get done.

71
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:42,623
And we really want to focus

72
00:02:42,623 --> 00:02:45,365
on not making that excuse anymore,

73
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,285
because we have time,

74
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:50,205
we just have to choose to
use it in the right way.

75
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:53,288
(rousing beat music)

76
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,180
You guys gonna help me?

77
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:02,585
- [Laura] Okay.

78
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,277
- [Jeremy] Good job.

79
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:15,270
♫ 525,600 minutes

80
00:03:17,852 --> 00:03:20,302
♫ How do you measure

81
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:22,923
♫ Measure a year

82
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:23,756
- How about

83
00:03:23,756 --> 00:03:25,673
♫ Love

84
00:03:27,779 --> 00:03:31,946
♫ You took the midnight
train going anywhere

85
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:36,567
♫ Strangers, waiting

86
00:03:37,493 --> 00:03:39,826
♫ On and on

87
00:03:42,119 --> 00:03:44,702
(bright music)

88
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:53,341
- So Kendra's been having a rough morning

89
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,781
and I thought this would cheer her up.

90
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:57,525
- So I'm struggling today

91
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,582
and it was really tempting for me

92
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:02,704
to not share with you guys
that I'm struggling today.

93
00:04:02,704 --> 00:04:05,944
Sometimes I feel like my struggles

94
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,528
don't fit in in our happy life

95
00:04:08,528 --> 00:04:12,802
and sometimes I feel silly
and embarrassed to share it,

96
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:15,146
because I do, I have a really good life,

97
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:16,954
there's a lot of beautiful things in it,

98
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:19,505
but in spite of that, I struggle.

99
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:21,547
I struggle with depression and anxiety

100
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:22,818
and it's a battle every day

101
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:24,660
and some days that battle is hard

102
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,195
and today that battle feels like

103
00:04:26,195 --> 00:04:28,299
it is beating me up inside.

104
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,363
So what I'm picturing in my mind today

105
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:33,038
to try to help myself, is a rollercoaster.

106
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:35,718
And rollercoasters, they go
up and then they go down.

107
00:04:35,718 --> 00:04:37,702
And then they go up and then they go down.

108
00:04:37,702 --> 00:04:39,686
And when you're on a rollercoaster

109
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:41,593
and you go down, you don't go oh no,

110
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:43,912
the rollercoaster's broken,

111
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:45,417
this is terrible, get off the ride!

112
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:48,001
I mean you might be scared,
because it's going down,

113
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:49,404
but it's part of the ride

114
00:04:49,404 --> 00:04:50,387
and you know that.

115
00:04:50,387 --> 00:04:51,771
You know the ride's gonna go down,

116
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,214
you know the ride's gonna go up

117
00:04:53,214 --> 00:04:54,790
and it's all part of the ride.

118
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,662
And so with my daily life

119
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:57,750
or with my anxiety and depression,

120
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,734
when I feel like coming down,

121
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:02,743
I try to picture that it's
part of the rollercoaster,

122
00:05:02,743 --> 00:05:04,214
like it's gonna come back up.

123
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:05,255
It's going to,

124
00:05:05,255 --> 00:05:07,527
and that it's part of the experience.

125
00:05:07,527 --> 00:05:10,440
It's part of my human
journey here on earth

126
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,768
and that it's okay.

127
00:05:11,768 --> 00:05:13,425
It's okay to have times that go down

128
00:05:13,425 --> 00:05:15,077
and just because it's a
time that's going down,

129
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:16,794
doesn't mean it's not gonna come back up.

130
00:05:16,794 --> 00:05:18,187
It sounds like a cliche at this point

131
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:19,402
but the struggle is real

132
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,086
and if you're struggling, you're not alone

133
00:05:21,086 --> 00:05:23,836
and today I'm going to do my best

134
00:05:25,744 --> 00:05:27,494
to enjoy the rollercoaster.

135
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,440
Nobody can be sad with this
little chica around, huh?

136
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,588
Whoops.

137
00:05:31,588 --> 00:05:32,581
(Kendra laughing)

138
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,998
What is going on?

139
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,640
Oh my goodness.

140
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,184
She pulled herself up to the fireplace

141
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:40,992
and now she wants this piece of paper.

142
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,544
So Jeremy and the kids came home

143
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:43,381
with a smoothie for me

144
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:45,492
and I just thought that was so thoughtful,

145
00:05:45,492 --> 00:05:46,838
like that definitely sounded amazing,

146
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:48,856
and I just thought it was sweet
that Jeremy did think of me.

147
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,290
And now I'm getting to do something else

148
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,761
that I love, which is snuggle
with my babies and read.

149
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:55,717
We're reading this one, The Cookie Fiasco.

150
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,757
Hey guys, cookie time.

151
00:05:57,757 --> 00:05:59,163
(laughs)

152
00:05:59,163 --> 00:06:01,898
Uh-oh, hold on, there are three cookies,

153
00:06:01,898 --> 00:06:03,282
but four of us.

154
00:06:03,282 --> 00:06:05,971
Someone will not get a cookie.

155
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:07,875
- We have time to exercise.

156
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,958
(rousing rock music)

157
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:21,350
- [Kendra] She's loving it,

158
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,100
oh look at her smile.

159
00:06:24,043 --> 00:06:24,876
- Ooh.

160
00:06:24,876 --> 00:06:26,998
- I got to go on a walk out
in this gorgeous weather

161
00:06:26,998 --> 00:06:30,592
and now I get to hold
and play with this baby.

162
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:31,877
And I'm doing math with Elise,

163
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:33,532
all things that I love.

164
00:06:33,532 --> 00:06:35,874
(lively classical music)

165
00:06:35,874 --> 00:06:37,707
- [Jeremy] You got it?

166
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:46,274
- We're carving our own pumpkins.

167
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:48,170
- [Kendra] Alright we've
got all the pumpkins here.

168
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,426
What's different this year Elise?

169
00:06:49,426 --> 00:06:51,450
- We're carving them, not painting.

170
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,202
- [Kendra] So the kids
are going to get to use

171
00:06:53,202 --> 00:06:54,683
these carving tools

172
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:57,266
with our help and supervision of course.

173
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:58,491
And they're going to each get to carve

174
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:00,012
their own pumpkin.

175
00:07:00,012 --> 00:07:01,932
(enchanting music)

176
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:03,662
- [Jeremy] Alright, we
got to clean out the guts.

177
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:05,119
- That is super heavy.

178
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:08,580
- [Jeremy] Alright, start scooping it out.

179
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,347
- See you have to like scrape it out.

180
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:12,180
- [Jeremy] That's right.

181
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,013
- [Kendra] So what are you gonna do

182
00:07:13,013 --> 00:07:14,329
with all those pumpkin seeds?

183
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,212
- I'm gonna make a pumpkin patch.

184
00:07:16,212 --> 00:07:17,982
That's not guts.
- What about this one?

185
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:19,301
- I have my own guts.

186
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:20,384
- [Kendra] What are you talking about?

187
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:21,217
- I'm my own guts.

188
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:22,376
- [Kendra] Where's your guts?

189
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:23,320
- In here.

190
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,792
- [Kendra] That's where
your brain is dude,

191
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,542
that's not your guts.

192
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:29,293
There it is.
- There it is.

193
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:30,433
- One two three.

194
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:31,969
- Oh that's heavy.

195
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:34,284
There's so much guts in there.

196
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,136
- So much guts.

197
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,847
Alright, there's Lise's.

198
00:07:37,847 --> 00:07:39,217
- Blech.
- Let me get you a spoon.

199
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,059
- Uh-huh.

200
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,085
- [Kendra] Look what we got.

201
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:44,695
It's called a pumpkin.
- It just smells weird.

202
00:07:44,695 --> 00:07:46,630
- [Kendra] Yeah, oh she's eating it.

203
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,086
- [Caleb] She's eating it.

204
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:51,504
- [Kendra] Nice trade, good work guys.

205
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:53,532
(grunting)

206
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:55,131
What are you making there Laura?

207
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:56,792
- I'm just stirring it up.

208
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:58,386
It's gonna grow.

209
00:07:58,386 --> 00:07:59,642
- [Kendra] Oh a pumpkin's
gonna grow in there.

210
00:07:59,642 --> 00:08:02,309
- Yeah, 'cause I told everybody,

211
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,984
one time I did that when I was a mom.

212
00:08:06,984 --> 00:08:08,205
- [Kendra] When you were a mom?

213
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:09,038
- Yeah.

214
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,146
- [Jeremy] What about
when you were a grandma?

215
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:14,477
- Because I did swirl
it, when I was a grandma.

216
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:15,799
- [Jeremy] Isaac is going in.

217
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:16,739
- [Elise] I'm doing good.

218
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:17,795
- [Jeremy] You're doing great.

219
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:19,918
- [Kendra] Eyebrows done, I love it.

220
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:21,501
- It's almost done.

221
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,086
(Jeremy gasps)

222
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,919
- [Jeremy] It came out.

223
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:25,879
- I got my eye.

224
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,705
I got my first eye done.

225
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:29,391
- [Kendra] So did you tell
them why we got a honeydew?

226
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,350
- So for Kendra and I,

227
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,525
our first Halloween, when we were engaged,

228
00:08:32,525 --> 00:08:34,917
there were no pumpkins
and so we got a honeydew

229
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:35,798
and carved it.

230
00:08:35,798 --> 00:08:37,371
So now we do it every year.

231
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,683
- [Kendra] It's a tradition.

232
00:08:38,683 --> 00:08:42,515
So Laura is in charge of
washing the pumpkin seeds.

233
00:08:42,515 --> 00:08:45,070
So she's washing them, moving
them over to this bowl,

234
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:47,325
washing them again, straining them,

235
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,950
she's got a whole system down.

236
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,783
- I made eye lashes.

237
00:08:49,783 --> 00:08:50,701
- Good job big girl.

238
00:08:50,701 --> 00:08:52,204
- Who wants to come see mine?

239
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:53,037
- [Kendra] I want to see yours.

240
00:08:53,037 --> 00:08:55,537
You have pumpkin in your hair.

241
00:08:57,518 --> 00:08:58,518
Right there.

242
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,998
It's on this side.

243
00:09:01,998 --> 00:09:04,582
So this is going surprisingly well.

244
00:09:04,582 --> 00:09:05,932
- [Jeremy] I don't know
if this is working.

245
00:09:05,932 --> 00:09:07,156
- Well it's very romantic.

246
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:09,443
Remember the year that
you did the J House?

247
00:09:09,443 --> 00:09:10,276
- Yeah.

248
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,070
- I remember that.

249
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,570
(spooky enchanting music)

250
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,390
- Okay we're gonna show the kids

251
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,872
the jack-o-lanterns with candles in.

252
00:09:22,872 --> 00:09:24,039
Okay, come on.

253
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,624
(laughs)

254
00:09:26,624 --> 00:09:28,629
- [Kendra] They look awesome.

255
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:30,087
- And it smells good.

256
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:31,132
- It smells like smoke.

257
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:32,070
- [Kendra] It does, the
smell does smell good.

258
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,926
- Guys they look great.

259
00:09:33,926 --> 00:09:36,541
Caleb I love the teeth on yours.

260
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:38,614
And Laura, I love the big smile on yours.

261
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:39,752
Lise, yours have lashes,

262
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:42,019
I've never seen eyelashes on it.

263
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:44,340
Isaac, your nostrils are amazing.

264
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,404
- All of them are beautiful!

265
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:47,348
- [Jeremy] Good job guys,
we're gonna put 'em out

266
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:48,810
on the front steps.

267
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,963
- Did you do the heart?

268
00:09:49,963 --> 00:09:50,944
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

269
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:52,872
- [Kendra] It looks amazing.

270
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:55,806
Dinner tonight is spaghetti with veggies

271
00:09:55,806 --> 00:09:57,596
and an apple and rolls.

272
00:09:57,596 --> 00:09:59,708
So I'm cleaning up after dinner

273
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:04,124
and next to a certain
child's cup, I find this.

274
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,148
Did you see this Jeremy?

275
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:06,504
- The Lima beans

276
00:10:06,504 --> 00:10:09,246
- [Kendra] It's three Lima beans.

277
00:10:09,246 --> 00:10:10,087
Apparently that child
does not like Lima beans

278
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,872
- Who likes Lima beans?

279
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:12,811
Let's be honest, in the poll question,

280
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,058
do any of you like Lima beans?

281
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,346
Let us know in the poll.

282
00:10:16,346 --> 00:10:17,348
- This is making me laugh,

283
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:21,003
because I remember how much
I hated Lima beans as a kid.

284
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:21,913
Now they don't bother me,

285
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,585
but they're still not my favorite, but

286
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:25,674
it's a classic.

287
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:28,289
- So we've hearing some
really strange noises

288
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:30,343
from the kids, and a lot of laughter,

289
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:32,195
so we're not sure exactly
what they're up to.

290
00:10:32,195 --> 00:10:34,797
- Ready for the show now!

291
00:10:34,797 --> 00:10:35,681
- [Jeremy] Okay let's see it,

292
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:36,514
what have you been up to?

293
00:10:36,514 --> 00:10:38,458
- [Isaac] Three two one.

294
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,578
(violin stroke)
(slapping)

295
00:10:39,578 --> 00:10:41,828
(laughing)

296
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:45,649
- [Jeremy] Do you guys have
a sound maker over here?

297
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,899
(squeaky violin music)

298
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,725
- Good night, J House out.

299
00:10:52,725 --> 00:10:54,892
- Good night, J House out.

300
00:10:57,241 --> 00:10:58,074
(lively music)

301
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:58,907
- Made it!

302
00:10:58,907 --> 00:10:59,987
- [Kendra] Is this your magic wands?

303
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:00,820
- Yep.

304
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,558
- The sticks chose us.

305
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:03,413
Those are very bad.

306
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:06,444
- [Kendra] What in the world,
I've never seen this before.

307
00:11:06,444 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh they're going that way!
