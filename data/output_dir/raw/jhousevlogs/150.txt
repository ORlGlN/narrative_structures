1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:02,701
- Janae had a big poo

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:04,797
and it's very disgusting and yeah.

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,265
- Did you just see that?

4
00:00:06,265 --> 00:00:08,249
- So it's getting hotter
and hotter in our house

5
00:00:08,249 --> 00:00:10,875
and I just called about getting it fixed

6
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,462
and they closed 15 minutes ago.

7
00:00:13,462 --> 00:00:15,962
(jolly music)

8
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,167
- Good morning.

9
00:00:18,167 --> 00:00:21,701
I actually have a really
terrible headache this morning.

10
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:24,652
But I'm getting up and
I'm trying to keep going

11
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:26,691
because I'm a mom, and that's
the only choice you have

12
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,767
when you're a mom.

13
00:00:27,767 --> 00:00:29,689
I know all the moms out there understand.

14
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:30,522
(baby cries)

15
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,601
If your mom is near you right now,

16
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:33,408
give her a great big hug
and tell her she's awesome

17
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:35,634
because being a mom is a really hard job.

18
00:00:35,634 --> 00:00:37,435
- You're awesome, mom.

19
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:39,645
- I didn't know she was listening.

20
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:41,866
You're awesome, Elise.

21
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:43,949
It's gonna be a good day.

22
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,858
- So I just changed into this

23
00:00:48,858 --> 00:00:50,617
and I still have my shorts on.

24
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,925
- [Jeremy] Oh, good thing.

25
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,792
What's the paper and pen for?

26
00:00:53,792 --> 00:00:56,778
- Oh, I have to draw things on it

27
00:00:56,778 --> 00:01:00,089
and so that I don't get sick very much.

28
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:01,077
- [Jeremy] It'll keep you from being sick

29
00:01:01,077 --> 00:01:02,205
if you draw things there?

30
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:03,038
- Yeah.

31
00:01:03,038 --> 00:01:05,205
- [Jeremy] Oh, good thing.

32
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,567
- Isaac's learning a song on the piano

33
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,741
and singing along to
it, it sounds awesome.

34
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:18,522
♫ I'll be there to save the day

35
00:01:18,522 --> 00:01:22,272
♫ Superman got nothing on me

36
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:26,860
♫ I'm only one call away

37
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:30,648
- [Kendra] He's so fun to
listen to when he practices.

38
00:01:30,648 --> 00:01:33,675
(piano playing)

39
00:01:33,675 --> 00:01:36,925
(drumming and singing)

40
00:01:38,708 --> 00:01:41,291
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:42,372 --> 00:01:44,403
(Janae laughing)

42
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:46,236
- Janae had a big poo,

43
00:01:47,419 --> 00:01:50,169
like all the way big to her back,

44
00:01:51,032 --> 00:01:55,262
and it's weird because
how she eats real food

45
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:58,179
is how she has like real, real poo.

46
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,843
Real.

47
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,375
Poo.

48
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,588
And it's very disgusting and yeah.

49
00:02:06,588 --> 00:02:08,558
- So Jeremy and I are both
in the room on opposite sides

50
00:02:08,558 --> 00:02:10,506
and we both look at Janae at the same time

51
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,668
and we see her crawl forward.

52
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:14,376
We're both like, "Did you just see that?"

53
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,166
Baby girl, you crawling?

54
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,166
All the toys over there.

55
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:23,997
(Jeremy and Kendra laughing)

56
00:02:23,997 --> 00:02:26,690
You're doing it, you're doing it, come on.

57
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,857
Get over here.

58
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,280
(Jeremy laughing)

59
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,613
That's crawling!

60
00:02:34,492 --> 00:02:36,742
You're crawling, baby girl!

61
00:02:38,922 --> 00:02:40,643
Watch out, world.

62
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,643
- [Jeremy] She can move.

63
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:46,237
There it is.

64
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,728
- Yay.

65
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:49,218
- [Jeremy] It's so fun to get to document

66
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,956
her progress through all her life.

67
00:02:51,956 --> 00:02:53,329
Love you.

68
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:55,222
- I don't know if I'm
ready for my baby to crawl.

69
00:02:55,222 --> 00:02:56,832
And it's definitely time to start

70
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,770
some serious baby-proofing around here.

71
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,007
- So over on our Facebook page,

72
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,888
Kendra asked what baby gates
we should be considering,

73
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:05,438
and we got so many suggestions from you.

74
00:03:05,438 --> 00:03:07,993
It's so fun to have that
interaction over there.

75
00:03:07,993 --> 00:03:10,476
- So we have a pile out
here, what are these?

76
00:03:10,476 --> 00:03:12,207
- Blankets!

77
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:14,341
- They're a special kind,
yeah they're quilts.

78
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:18,163
- These are quilt or things people make.

79
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:18,996
- Right?

80
00:03:18,996 --> 00:03:21,526
Kay, so who made this one?

81
00:03:21,526 --> 00:03:22,359
- You!

82
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:23,192
- You!

83
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:24,892
- And it was my baby blanket.

84
00:03:24,892 --> 00:03:25,725
- It was.

85
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:28,078
This one!

86
00:03:28,078 --> 00:03:29,296
- Daddy.

87
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,129
- Dad?

88
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:31,074
Dad did not make this.

89
00:03:31,074 --> 00:03:32,015
- You.

90
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:32,848
- I made this one again.

91
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:33,681
Who did I make it for?

92
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,514
- Isaac and--

93
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,511
- Isaac and me.

94
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:36,818
I think it was for Caleb.

95
00:03:36,818 --> 00:03:38,567
- It was, it was Caleb's baby blanket.

96
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:39,400
(cheering)

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,670
- This one!

98
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,503
- For me!

99
00:03:41,503 --> 00:03:42,336
- Grandma!

100
00:03:42,336 --> 00:03:43,805
- Grandmom.

101
00:03:43,805 --> 00:03:45,989
- It's so beautiful!

102
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,659
She made it by hand.

103
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,607
- Well, I'm sure she used
a sewing machine too.

104
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,217
So guys, this one's really special

105
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:52,811
because it was given to your Dad and I

106
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,878
from Grandmother.

107
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:57,461
(upbeat music)

108
00:04:01,728 --> 00:04:04,170
It's called Papa and the Pioneer Quilt.

109
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,837
(telling story)

110
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:12,199
So what are they collecting along the way?

111
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,050
- Fabrics!

112
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,679
- Scraps of fabric, okay.

113
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:17,778
So every time she gets a scrap of fabric

114
00:04:17,778 --> 00:04:19,968
I'm gonna give you all
a scrap of fabric too.

115
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:22,551
(upbeat music)

116
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,250
Elise is helping me with lunch.

117
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,083
What are we making?

118
00:04:26,083 --> 00:04:28,161
- Tuna salad sandwiches.

119
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:30,093
- [Kendra] Chicken salad pitas.

120
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,273
When we make chicken salad,

121
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:34,067
instead of using mayo, or Miracle Whip,

122
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,518
we use plain greek yogurt

123
00:04:35,518 --> 00:04:37,869
and then add just a
titch of ranch seasoning

124
00:04:37,869 --> 00:04:42,451
and it's really good and it's
a little healthier that way.

125
00:04:42,451 --> 00:04:44,576
Is the can opener giving you problems?

126
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,618
- Yeah, I'm right almost there.

127
00:04:46,618 --> 00:04:47,689
- [Kendra] You're almost there.

128
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:48,878
You can do it, girlfriend.

129
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:49,937
You are strong.

130
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:52,012
- I did not know I could open a can.

131
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,226
- [Kendra] Well, you
did a great job on it.

132
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:55,994
We just added the ranch,
it's looking good.

133
00:04:55,994 --> 00:04:57,784
- Lunch is served.

134
00:04:57,784 --> 00:04:59,216
- So I got out all of my scrap fabrics

135
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:01,253
and I'm letting the kids
lay them out on the floor

136
00:05:01,253 --> 00:05:03,052
and design what they would do for a quilt

137
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,261
with those scrap fabrics.

138
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,966
This is a very unique design, Isaac.

139
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:08,600
I love it when we do an
activity where everybody's quiet

140
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,279
'cause they're so engaged
in what they're doing.

141
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:13,049
To me, that's like a
winning moment as a mom.

142
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:15,487
Oh my goodness, what a fun quilt!

143
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,033
I love the sparkly one.

144
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:18,082
- Mm hm.

145
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:20,065
- So Isaac decided to go abstract

146
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,687
and not make it into a
square or a rectangle.

147
00:05:22,687 --> 00:05:25,864
And here's what Laura
ended up finishing up

148
00:05:25,864 --> 00:05:26,854
with her quilt.

149
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:29,349
Here's Isaac's second design.

150
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,982
I love it, dude.

151
00:05:30,982 --> 00:05:32,863
Here's Caleb's finished quilt.

152
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:34,962
And you turned into Superman.

153
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:37,712
(glorious music)

154
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:42,461
81 degrees inside, and we've
been trying to cool it off

155
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:44,226
and it just keeps getting hotter.

156
00:05:44,226 --> 00:05:45,892
So we actually got our
air conditioning fixed

157
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:47,572
or replaced or something like that

158
00:05:47,572 --> 00:05:50,644
back in the spring, and so
it should not be going out.

159
00:05:50,644 --> 00:05:53,159
So I don't know why it's
not cooling off our house.

160
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,226
(rock music)

161
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,612
- [Jeremy] So what are we doing, Caleb?

162
00:05:57,612 --> 00:05:58,788
- [Caleb] We're building a bench!

163
00:05:58,788 --> 00:06:00,392
Or a table.

164
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:01,928
- [Jeremy] Yup, we're gonna
put the bench together.

165
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,345
(rock music)

166
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,386
- [Caleb] Whoa!

167
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,098
- [Jeremy] Go ahead and
take all the pieces out.

168
00:06:13,098 --> 00:06:14,863
And let's set them out on the floor.

169
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:16,920
(rock music)

170
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,776
- These are the legs.

171
00:06:17,776 --> 00:06:18,752
- All right, the first thing you gotta do

172
00:06:18,752 --> 00:06:20,113
is get a screwdriver.

173
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:23,056
- I think it's much easier
if I just get my tools.

174
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:25,456
- Go get your drill from your toolbox.

175
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:26,289
- Dad!

176
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,271
- Grab a screwdriver, we
gotta unscrew all of these.

177
00:06:30,271 --> 00:06:31,313
- Okay.

178
00:06:31,313 --> 00:06:33,730
(rock music)

179
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:40,134
- Caleb, you're trying
to do it all in one load?

180
00:06:40,134 --> 00:06:41,303
So when I'm doing projects like this,

181
00:06:41,303 --> 00:06:42,725
it's important for me to always remember

182
00:06:42,725 --> 00:06:46,101
I'm not trying to build a
bench the quickest I can,

183
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:48,066
I'm trying to do it with my kids

184
00:06:48,066 --> 00:06:50,593
because raising the kids is more important

185
00:06:50,593 --> 00:06:52,956
than how fast the bench gets built.

186
00:06:52,956 --> 00:06:55,215
And what we're gonna do
is on each of the screws

187
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:58,891
we're gonna first put
on this big disc washer.

188
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:01,172
- Ooh, it's hot in here.

189
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:02,903
- So it's getting hotter
and hotter in our house,

190
00:07:02,903 --> 00:07:05,742
and I just called about getting it fixed

191
00:07:05,742 --> 00:07:08,346
and they closed 15 minutes ago.

192
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:10,279
So if we're gonna have someone
come out and look at it,

193
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:12,864
it's an extra 150 dollars.

194
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:14,652
I tried turning it off and turning it on,

195
00:07:14,652 --> 00:07:16,271
that works with computers,

196
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,816
maybe it'll work with the AC.

197
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:19,158
We'll see.

198
00:07:19,158 --> 00:07:20,065
But if it keeps getting hotter

199
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,048
we're gonna have to just
pay the after-hours fee.

200
00:07:22,048 --> 00:07:24,379
(Janae crying)

201
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:26,712
She is not happy about that.

202
00:07:27,604 --> 00:07:31,234
- [Kendra] All right,
now stand it up tall.

203
00:07:31,234 --> 00:07:32,067
- [Jeremy] Now sit on it and make sure

204
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,178
that it's good and strong.

205
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:35,011
- Oh!

206
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,122
It's perfect.

207
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,519
- Hey, Dad, you need to get on it

208
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,105
so we know it's perfect.

209
00:07:39,105 --> 00:07:40,576
- [Jeremy] Why would that help?

210
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,136
- Because you weigh a ton.

211
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,845
(Jeremy laughing)

212
00:07:43,845 --> 00:07:46,421
- [Kendra] All right, if
it can hold all of you.

213
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:47,254
- Wow!

214
00:07:47,254 --> 00:07:48,087
(applause)

215
00:07:48,087 --> 00:07:49,446
- It can hold up all of us.

216
00:07:49,446 --> 00:07:51,883
- [Jeremy] Good job.
- [Kendra] Bring it on in.

217
00:07:51,883 --> 00:07:53,545
- [Jeremy] All right.

218
00:07:53,545 --> 00:07:54,378
A bench!

219
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:56,998
- [Kendra] We have a bench!

220
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,217
Table for eight.

221
00:07:58,217 --> 00:07:59,838
It doesn't match perfectly,

222
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:01,764
this is like a little bit more tan

223
00:08:01,764 --> 00:08:03,288
and this is a little bit more yellow

224
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,211
but it is close enough.

225
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:07,998
I'm so excited that instead
of buying a whole new table,

226
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:09,433
a bench solves this problem.

227
00:08:09,433 --> 00:08:10,266
Yes!

228
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:17,084
We have friends over,

229
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:18,623
and we're playing in
the sprinkler tonight,

230
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,234
which is awesome, 'cause it's warm out.

231
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:24,432
(children laughing and playing)

232
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:25,351
Filling up the pool?

233
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:28,684
For the little kids, that's nice of you.

234
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:34,493
Well, it is after 8 p.m.
and it's still 83 degrees

235
00:08:34,493 --> 00:08:36,948
in our house and the
temperature just keeps rising

236
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,025
and so we now have an
air conditioning person

237
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:40,956
out in the dark using a flashlight

238
00:08:40,957 --> 00:08:41,789
trying to figure out what's wrong

239
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,872
with our air conditioner.

240
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:50,917
- [Voiceover] Good night.

241
00:08:50,917 --> 00:08:52,200
J House out.

242
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,440
- [Jeremy] Two.

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,923
Two boxes.

244
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,320
- Wait, I'm excited about both of these!

245
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,153
- [Jeremy] I know.

246
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,568
I'm sorry, buddy.

247
00:08:58,568 --> 00:08:59,502
- [Kendra] I did it!

248
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:00,488
I did it, I did it.

249
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,436
I figured it out.

250
00:09:01,436 --> 00:09:03,650
I know the answer, and Jeremy doesn't.

251
00:09:03,650 --> 00:00:00,000
(acoustic music)
