1
00:00:00,394 --> 00:00:01,227
- Oh my

2
00:00:02,223 --> 00:00:03,056
- Whoa.

3
00:00:03,056 --> 00:00:04,497
- [Jeremy] Oh my gosh.

4
00:00:04,497 --> 00:00:05,497
(dramatic music)

5
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,613
No, is it a tornado?

6
00:00:07,613 --> 00:00:11,001
Kids go downstairs, go downstairs.

7
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,751
- I hope our house doesn't break.

8
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:16,146
- Our trampoline.

9
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,146
(gasps)

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,313
(thunder)

11
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,500
- I'm making a cake in a pot.

12
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:32,950
Perfect.

13
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,145
- [Kendra] And it's a cake?

14
00:00:34,145 --> 00:00:35,726
What kind of a cake?

15
00:00:35,726 --> 00:00:36,679
- Strawberry.

16
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:38,374
- [Kendra] Good, I'm glad
you didn't say bean cake.

17
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:40,334
- My cake is strawberry.

18
00:00:40,334 --> 00:00:41,486
- [Kendra] Is your cake strawberry?

19
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:42,816
Are you gonna make a cake too?

20
00:00:42,816 --> 00:00:43,649
- Mmm-mmm.

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,886
(sweet playful music)

22
00:00:49,863 --> 00:00:52,780
(funky beat music)

23
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,202
(yelling)

24
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:04,535
- [Jeremy] Keep going Isaac.

25
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,723
So how did the game go?

26
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:11,556
- We won.

27
00:01:11,556 --> 00:01:12,689
- [Jeremy] That's exciting.

28
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:13,522
Was that your guys' first win,

29
00:01:13,522 --> 00:01:14,355
or have you won another game?

30
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:16,518
- No we won twice and they won twice.

31
00:01:16,518 --> 00:01:17,405
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

32
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:18,830
I'm really proud of you, you played great.

33
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,877
- Thanks.

34
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:22,544
(piano playing)

35
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,709
- [Kendra] Okay so let's just do this one.

36
00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:32,699
- So Janae has started to
try to lift herself up.

37
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:33,842
It's crazy.

38
00:01:33,842 --> 00:01:35,234
- [Kendra] Uh-oh.

39
00:01:35,234 --> 00:01:37,317
Baby sister sees the car.

40
00:01:38,923 --> 00:01:40,107
What do you think?

41
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:42,000
- [Jeremy] What are you guys doing?

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,875
- We're reading sports books.

43
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:46,070
- [Jeremy] Oh she's down there.

44
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,209
- We're just reading books.

45
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,443
- [Jeremy] Oh awesome.

46
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,570
♫ You know you're not alone

47
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,106
♫ I'm only one

48
00:01:54,106 --> 00:01:56,105
♫ Come away

49
00:01:56,105 --> 00:02:00,105
♫ I'll be there to save the day

50
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,288
(sweet music)

51
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,121
- [Jeremy] Takin' a nap, big girl?

52
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:11,112
How did you sleep?

53
00:02:12,664 --> 00:02:14,581
Do you want to go play?

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,026
Whatcha doing Laura?

55
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,492
- I'm playing outside with this,

56
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:30,356
so that I don't get rained on,

57
00:02:30,356 --> 00:02:32,242
so I play with the umbrella.

58
00:02:32,242 --> 00:02:36,409
- [Jeremy] Do you want me
to open the door for ya?

59
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:40,780
- [Isaac] I would close it if I were you.

60
00:02:42,768 --> 00:02:43,917
- Made it.
- Good.

61
00:02:43,917 --> 00:02:46,582
- [Jeremy] Did you put some
extra make-up on again?

62
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:47,910
- Uh-huh.

63
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:49,819
- [Jeremy] Oh wow, how did you do that?

64
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,619
- I painted them.

65
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,115
- [Jeremy] Painted them, with a pen?

66
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:54,194
That umbrella totally reminds me

67
00:02:54,194 --> 00:02:56,506
of when we were at Disneyland

68
00:02:56,506 --> 00:02:57,522
and it started raining on us

69
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:59,595
and we were completely unprepared

70
00:02:59,595 --> 00:03:01,642
and had to get stuff.

71
00:03:01,642 --> 00:03:03,679
We decided to go with the Disney ponchos

72
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:04,794
and an umbrella,

73
00:03:04,794 --> 00:03:07,232
because the rain has picked
up again pretty hard.

74
00:03:07,232 --> 00:03:10,191
(uptempo dance music)

75
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:12,393
- It's fun to get wet, right Dad?

76
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:13,840
- It's pretty fun,

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,505
especially if you've got an umbrella.

78
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:19,172
(lively music)

79
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:21,915
So in our backyard as
the leaves start to fall,

80
00:03:21,915 --> 00:03:23,393
it gets easier and easier to watch

81
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:25,985
the squirrels leaping from tree to tree.

82
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,985
It's super entertaining.

83
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:38,442
The sky is incredible right now.

84
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:42,109
(soaring atmospheric music)

85
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:50,318
- This is going to turn into a pet.

86
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:51,497
- [Jeremy] That leaf?

87
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:52,330
- Uh-huh.

88
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,981
- [Jeremy] What kind of pet?

89
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:55,814
- [Laura] A cat.

90
00:03:55,814 --> 00:03:56,647
- [Jeremy] A cat?

91
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,117
- If it stays in the cup.

92
00:03:58,117 --> 00:04:01,119
- [Jeremy] What will
you name your pet cat?

93
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,343
- Rachel.

94
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:03,176
- Rachel?

95
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,009
- Uh-huh.

96
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:04,857
- Well there you have it.

97
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:06,945
Let us know in the comments
if your name's Rachel.

98
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:07,799
- [Kendra] Lise I think your book

99
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:09,287
should have a purple color.

100
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:12,615
- I think it should have a pink color.

101
00:04:12,615 --> 00:04:14,410
Janae wants pink, see?

102
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,777
(Jeremy laughs)

103
00:04:16,777 --> 00:04:17,610
No, no,

104
00:04:18,646 --> 00:04:20,048
no no!

105
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,215
- It's so fun.

106
00:04:22,284 --> 00:04:25,201
(Janae yelling)

107
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:28,301
(dramatic suspenseful music)

108
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,282
- Well as we're getting ready to head

109
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,867
on our date night, it has
gotten a little bit more stormy.

110
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,161
You can hear the thunder

111
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:37,890
and it has been coming down a little bit.

112
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,156
You know what I love most
about your outfit here?

113
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,239
How shiny your pants are.

114
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,779
- They're my ballet tights.

115
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,152
- [Jeremy] Oh they're your
ballet tights, that explains it.

116
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:48,717
- I couldn't find any football pants.

117
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:49,550
- Hey, football players
can wear ballet pants,

118
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,138
there's nothing wrong with that.

119
00:04:51,138 --> 00:04:52,921
Show me your moves.

120
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:54,395
There is it.

121
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,820
(Jeremy laughs)

122
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,731
I was wanting to see your ballet moves,

123
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,275
not your football moves.

124
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:00,108
- Oh.

125
00:05:00,108 --> 00:05:00,941
- Let's see your ballet moves.

126
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,142
There we go.

127
00:05:02,142 --> 00:05:03,886
(classical music)

128
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,448
Perfect.

129
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:06,281
- Get up!

130
00:05:07,163 --> 00:05:09,580
- [Jeremy] Whoa, that's impressive.

131
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,054
Isaac can you make it all the way?

132
00:05:12,054 --> 00:05:13,507
- I can almost.

133
00:05:13,507 --> 00:05:14,340
- I can make it all the way.

134
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,241
- With the arms a twirling.

135
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,305
That's one of the things that I wish

136
00:05:18,305 --> 00:05:19,425
as I got older,

137
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:21,765
that I kept up with was stretching

138
00:05:21,765 --> 00:05:24,176
and trying to maintain some flexibility.

139
00:05:24,176 --> 00:05:25,408
I need to get back into that.

140
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,047
- But I have my own little
sport with the diaper.

141
00:05:27,047 --> 00:05:28,982
I like to toss it from the bed

142
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:29,982
into the diaper pail.

143
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:31,479
- [Jeremy] Let's see if Mom can make it.

144
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,075
- Ready?

145
00:05:33,075 --> 00:05:34,267
(lively rock music)

146
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,100
Oh!
- Oh!

147
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,768
- I knew I was gonna miss, okay okay.

148
00:05:37,768 --> 00:05:38,601
Ready?

149
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:40,808
- [Jeremy] You got it Mom.

150
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,442
Oh, in and out.

151
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:43,859
- It bounced out.

152
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,030
- Jeremy thinks he's gonna get this.

153
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:49,509
- From back in the corner,

154
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:50,342
(thud)

155
00:05:50,342 --> 00:05:51,573
oh!

156
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:53,887
(powering down)

157
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:56,432
(dramatic music)

158
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,716
(thunder)

159
00:05:57,716 --> 00:05:59,140
- Oh my.

160
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,572
- [Jeremy] It is raining out there.

161
00:06:00,572 --> 00:06:03,007
- [Kendra] Whoa, it is really raining now.

162
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,590
- Holy cows, it is coming down.

163
00:06:07,438 --> 00:06:08,668
Whoa.

164
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,501
Whoa!

165
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,050
Oh my goodness!

166
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:16,981
Oh my goodness!

167
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,314
Is it a tornado?

168
00:06:22,206 --> 00:06:24,141
I thought I was gonna die a little bit.

169
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:24,974
(laughing)

170
00:06:24,974 --> 00:06:27,781
I had reached a flight or fight feeling

171
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:29,747
in my heart as that came swirling

172
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:32,023
around on both sides of the house.

173
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:32,965
That was terrifying.
- What in the world?

174
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:34,298
- Should we check the weather?

175
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,889
- We're in the tornado

176
00:06:35,889 --> 00:06:37,731
temperature right now.
- Season.

177
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:38,970
- [Kendra] It was an
intense amount of rain.

178
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,160
- [Caleb] Is this a microverse?

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,729
- This is insane.
- Should we go downstairs?

180
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:45,964
- [Kendra] Tornado watch.

181
00:06:45,964 --> 00:06:48,082
- [Jeremy] Tornado watch,
it is a tornado watch.

182
00:06:48,082 --> 00:06:49,233
- It is a tornado watch.

183
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,970
- [Jeremy] Should we go
downstairs to the basement?

184
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,803
- Just a second.

185
00:06:51,803 --> 00:06:53,090
- [Jeremy] That was crazy.

186
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,633
And it came up out of nowhere.

187
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,751
- The sirens aren't going off.
- Oh did our door open?

188
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:58,584
- No that's just rain.
- Okay.

189
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,417
- Oh my gosh.

190
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:00,923
- Look at our tree.

191
00:07:00,923 --> 00:07:02,553
- [Kendra] Wait, let's just
go down to the basement.

192
00:07:02,553 --> 00:07:04,626
- [Jeremy] Let's go down you guys.

193
00:07:04,626 --> 00:07:07,000
No, look at our tree.

194
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,833
- [Kendra] Stay strong, little tree.

195
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:11,680
- [Jeremy] We love you tree, don't die.

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,198
Oh my goodness.

197
00:07:13,198 --> 00:07:14,889
Okay kids, let's go
downstairs, go downstairs

198
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,776
and get in the basement.

199
00:07:17,776 --> 00:07:18,780
It was not very long ago

200
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,747
that we were outside playing.

201
00:07:21,747 --> 00:07:25,850
This is crazy.
- It's a little tornado, Dad.

202
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,891
- [Kendra] Are you guys in there?

203
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:30,708
(deluging rain)

204
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,110
- [Jeremy] Oh my gosh.

205
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,027
Oh my gosh!

206
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:36,680
- [Kendra] Is that hail?

207
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

208
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,813
- [Kendra] Okay, it's
hail, Jeremy come down.

209
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:42,658
(thunder)

210
00:07:42,658 --> 00:07:43,809
Whoa.

211
00:07:43,809 --> 00:07:45,429
- When it is gonna stop?

212
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,869
- [Jeremy] When is it gonna stop?

213
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:47,702
- Yeah.

214
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:48,535
- [Jeremy] Hopefully really soon.

215
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:50,287
I think we're gonna be safe, okay?

216
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:51,370
Come in here.

217
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,587
- We should, we shouldn't have

218
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,696
We shouldn't have these
kinds of tornadoes before.

219
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,533
- This might be a microverse

220
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,366
if you know what it is.

221
00:08:05,366 --> 00:08:07,449
- [Jeremy] What is a microverse?

222
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:09,552
- I hope our house doesn't break.

223
00:08:09,552 --> 00:08:10,679
Are we gonna sleep in here?

224
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,952
- [Kendra] I don't think
we're gonna sleep in here.

225
00:08:11,952 --> 00:08:13,736
I think the storm's gonna pass.

226
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:14,793
Do you guys want to hear something funny?

227
00:08:14,793 --> 00:08:15,829
- What?
- What?

228
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,942
- [Kendra] I just checked the weather

229
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,992
and it says that right now
we're getting some light rain.

230
00:08:19,992 --> 00:08:21,388
- What?

231
00:08:21,388 --> 00:08:23,590
- [Kendra] This is not light rain.

232
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,623
- [Laura] It's dark rain.

233
00:08:24,623 --> 00:08:25,838
- [Kendra] It's dark rain?

234
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,400
- Because it's nighttime.

235
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,274
- [Kendra] Yeah exactly.

236
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,511
- There's a ton of light rain.

237
00:08:30,511 --> 00:08:32,119
- A ton of light rain?

238
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,510
So this is probably the most intense

239
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,414
thunderstorm I have ever been in

240
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,318
and that's saying a lot,

241
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:38,941
because I grew up in the Midwest

242
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:41,964
and this one, the wind
and the hail and the rain,

243
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:43,789
I mean, it is intense.

244
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,275
So the sirens have not gone off,

245
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,211
but we're under a tornado watch right now,

246
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:49,402
and with the hail and
the wind and the rain,

247
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,266
I don't know if we would hear the sirens,

248
00:08:51,266 --> 00:08:53,563
so we're just lying low,
hanging out in the basement

249
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:55,596
until this intense part
of the storm passes.

250
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:56,763
- Well we're gonna go up and investigate.

251
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:57,779
We haven't heard the sirens

252
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,402
so I think were good to go.

253
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:01,235
- Our trampoline.

254
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:02,434
(gasps)

255
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:03,851
- Oh my goodness.

256
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:06,793
- [Jeremy] I can't believe it.

257
00:09:06,793 --> 00:09:08,167
- Oh my goodness.

258
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,000
- [Laura] Oh my goodness.

259
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,868
- [Kendra] I'm so glad
we were not outside.

260
00:09:10,868 --> 00:09:11,701
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

261
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,412
- On the trampoline.

262
00:09:13,412 --> 00:09:14,245
- Yeah.

263
00:09:14,245 --> 00:09:15,530
- [Jeremy] That's insane.

264
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,955
- Is it ruined do you think?

265
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:21,588
- [Jeremy] Well the bars on
the outside are right there.

266
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:24,005
(heavy rain)

267
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:30,114
- Whoa, the trees are down.

268
00:09:30,114 --> 00:09:30,947
- [Kendra] Are there trees down?

269
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,063
Did you see it?

270
00:09:32,063 --> 00:09:33,752
Straight out from the deck.

271
00:09:33,752 --> 00:09:35,364
- [Laura] I'm glad no tree
didn't fall out there.

272
00:09:35,364 --> 00:09:38,026
- Oh yeah, it broke a limb.

273
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:42,069
- [Kendra] So we got a limb
down and a trampoline flipped.

274
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,069
So this red

275
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,993
- [Jeremy] Is what we're going through?

276
00:09:45,993 --> 00:09:46,826
- [Kendra] This is the storm.

277
00:09:46,826 --> 00:09:48,504
- [Jeremy] We're in the
middle of it right now.

278
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:51,254
- Isaac, don't go down there, no!

279
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,359
- [Jeremy] Are you nervous for him Laura?

280
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,353
- [Kendra] Laura, come here.

281
00:09:54,353 --> 00:09:55,310
- Everything's gonna be okay alright.

282
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,139
- Come here, come here big girl.

283
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:59,642
Now it's just a rain storm, okay?

284
00:09:59,642 --> 00:10:00,927
It's just rain.

285
00:10:00,927 --> 00:10:01,760
So Jeremy and I are supposed to be going

286
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,009
on a date night tonight,

287
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,571
but I don't really feel comfortable

288
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,705
leaving the kids right now.

289
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,451
The weather's just too intense for tha.

290
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,330
- I want to move.

291
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:11,406
- [Kendra] Where do you want to move?

292
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:15,159
- Somewhere that it can't catch up to us,

293
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,625
and not break our trees,

294
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:19,343
and a house that doesn't have trees.

295
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:22,426
- Okay, hey Laura, we are safe, okay?

296
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,269
- The rain will stop soon.

297
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:26,983
- Yeah, the rain is stopping.

298
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:29,788
- The rain is gone and the wind's stopped.

299
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,140
- It's like bright out here now,

300
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:34,192
like the sun is coming out.

301
00:10:34,192 --> 00:10:36,321
Kansas City weather is insane.

302
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:38,897
I can actually see blue
skies in some parts,

303
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:39,783
the storm is past,

304
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,447
we're grateful to be safe.

305
00:10:41,447 --> 00:10:43,576
We'll check on the trampoline tomorrow.

306
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:44,415
J House out.

307
00:10:44,415 --> 00:10:45,667
- [Kendra] Who's here?

308
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:47,342
- [All] Daddy!

309
00:10:47,342 --> 00:10:49,470
- [Kendra] Are you watching
your big brothers goofing off

310
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,278
on the other side of that window?

311
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:52,634
- Why do you think
we're making a skeleton?

312
00:10:52,634 --> 00:00:00,000
- Because it's almost Halloween.
