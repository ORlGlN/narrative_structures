1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:01,151
- [Jeremy] Two.

2
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:01,984
(gasps)

3
00:00:01,984 --> 00:00:03,054
- [Jeremy] Two boxes.

4
00:00:03,054 --> 00:00:04,375
- I'm excited about both of these.

5
00:00:04,375 --> 00:00:05,331
- [Jeremy] I know.

6
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:07,111
I'm so sorry buddy.

7
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,598
- I did it, I did it, I did it.

8
00:00:08,598 --> 00:00:09,566
I figured it out.

9
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:12,473
I know the answer, and
Jeremy doesn't bahaha.

10
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:15,256
(lively music)

11
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,370
- The toothpaste is all dirty.

12
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,259
- [Jeremy] How does that even happen?

13
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:21,682
What do you got your backpack on for?

14
00:00:21,682 --> 00:00:23,345
- For the trip.

15
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:24,929
- [Jeremy] What trip?

16
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:26,505
- I don't know.

17
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:28,028
- [Jeremy] Are we going
on a field trip today?

18
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:28,861
- Yeah.

19
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:31,963
(running water)

20
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:33,359
(piano playing)

21
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,359
♫ I'll be there to save the day

22
00:00:39,009 --> 00:00:42,926
♫ Superman's got nothing on me

23
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:48,998
♫ I'm only one call away

24
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:52,824
- I'm gonna keep working.

25
00:00:52,824 --> 00:00:54,718
- So today we are going
on our first field trip

26
00:00:54,718 --> 00:00:55,877
of the homeschool year,

27
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:57,797
and since we've been studying
Oregon Trail so much,

28
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:00,533
we found out that there's
actually a national trails museum

29
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,024
right here in the Kansas City area,

30
00:01:02,024 --> 00:01:03,600
so we're going there to check it out.

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,183
(upbeat music)

32
00:01:09,489 --> 00:01:10,659
- Well we drove out here
to where we're doing

33
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:14,882
the field trip and Caleb
just isn't feeling very well.

34
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:16,202
We're not sure what's going on.

35
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,506
- So he has no fever,

36
00:01:17,506 --> 00:01:19,170
he ate well this morning,
he did his chores,

37
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,003
and was running around

38
00:01:20,003 --> 00:01:21,780
and then all of a sudden,
he's not feeling good.

39
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,851
So we'll see how long
this field trip lasts.

40
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,002
We might have to cut it short.

41
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:28,252
(bright country music)

42
00:01:31,288 --> 00:01:32,694
- I love mink.

43
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:34,311
- A squirrel.

44
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:35,144
- [Kendra] Is it a squirrel?

45
00:01:35,144 --> 00:01:37,009
- [Jeremy] That's a big squirrel.

46
00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:39,071
- [Kendra] That one's called a beaver.

47
00:01:39,071 --> 00:01:40,354
- Hello.

48
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:41,187
- Hello.

49
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:44,306
- And we're walking and
walking and walking.

50
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:46,355
- Here's St. Louis and
here's Independence,

51
00:01:46,355 --> 00:01:48,675
and then here's where the
trails went from there.

52
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,239
You could come down here
to Santa Fe, New Mexico.

53
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:55,413
- [Jeremy] Cub is not feeling good.

54
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:56,997
I'm so sorry buddy.

55
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,178
- Well this isn't
exactly going as planned.

56
00:01:59,178 --> 00:02:00,705
The museum is lovely,

57
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:03,025
but Jeremy is with Caleb in the restroom,

58
00:02:03,025 --> 00:02:04,634
which means I've got to
get all the other kids

59
00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:07,384
and this little peanut is excited

60
00:02:08,776 --> 00:02:11,611
to not hold still or cooperate.

61
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,731
This is one of those moments as a mom,

62
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:14,299
when you're like, do we just bail?

63
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:15,798
Do we just say, you know what,
well do this another day,

64
00:02:15,798 --> 00:02:16,737
let's go home.

65
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:17,570
Or do we push through.

66
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,820
(jangly uptempo music)

67
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:24,198
Okay here are the rules,

68
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:25,680
you guys get to fill up your wagon,

69
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,943
packing it with what you think you need,

70
00:02:27,943 --> 00:02:29,984
and then you're gonna
see if it's too heavy.

71
00:02:29,984 --> 00:02:30,991
- [Jeremy] If they go
over the weight limit,

72
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:33,074
this light will turn red.

73
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:35,568
- Rice is good.

74
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:38,424
- [Jeremy] Load up the wagon.

75
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,174
- [Isaac] Dried apples or dried peaches?

76
00:02:41,174 --> 00:02:43,257
- We need a lot of flour.

77
00:02:47,338 --> 00:02:49,287
Two things of water.

78
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:51,095
- [Jeremy] Let's see what happens.

79
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,392
(record scratching)

80
00:02:52,392 --> 00:02:53,634
- Red.

81
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:55,346
- And orange.

82
00:02:55,346 --> 00:02:57,429
Yeah, we don't need that.

83
00:03:01,417 --> 00:03:02,250
It's just because it's

84
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,711
(record scratching)

85
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:04,707
(yelling)

86
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,325
- It's too heavy.

87
00:03:06,325 --> 00:03:08,386
We need to take out a few things,

88
00:03:08,386 --> 00:03:09,886
like one bed roll,

89
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:13,386
um where's the canteen oil.

90
00:03:13,386 --> 00:03:15,443
That's the gunpower, we need that.

91
00:03:15,443 --> 00:03:17,207
- Yeah, we need gunpowder.

92
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,576
- [Jeremy] It's still on.

93
00:03:18,576 --> 00:03:19,845
- It's off!

94
00:03:19,845 --> 00:03:21,772
I think this is good enough.

95
00:03:21,772 --> 00:03:24,939
(tropical beat music)

96
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,516
- So they used all the
parts of the buffalo,

97
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,323
when they shot and killed the buffalo.

98
00:03:35,323 --> 00:03:37,816
These were the buffalo bladders.

99
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:39,572
And it said, buffalo
bladders like this one

100
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:42,603
often became canteens for water.

101
00:03:42,603 --> 00:03:45,037
- What are buffalo bladders?

102
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:45,989
- It's the part of the buffalo

103
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:47,357
that holds their pee.

104
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,107
- Is it buffalo poop?

105
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:53,354
- [Kendra] Buffalo poop they used to cook.

106
00:03:53,354 --> 00:03:56,021
(wheel turning)

107
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,572
Make it to the gold fields,

108
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,317
but die in an accident.

109
00:04:01,317 --> 00:04:03,984
(wheel turning)

110
00:04:05,907 --> 00:04:09,138
- [Jeremy] What's he gonna get?

111
00:04:09,138 --> 00:04:10,429
- [Kendra] Aww, you found gold,

112
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:11,379
but lost it all gambling.

113
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:13,295
- [Jeremy] You and Elise did it together.

114
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,528
(wheel turning)

115
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:16,485
Janae loves it.

116
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,318
- Janae likes the toy.

117
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:22,475
Okay, this one'll be for Dad.

118
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,363
- [Jeremy] What's gonna happen to me?

119
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,196
- Aww.

120
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:27,132
- [Jeremy] What happened?

121
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:27,965
- You found gold,

122
00:04:27,965 --> 00:04:29,749
but just enough to meet expenses.

123
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:30,741
Guys I'm our last chance.

124
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,986
- [Jeremy] Wait, is there one
on here where you can get it?

125
00:04:32,986 --> 00:04:34,339
- Yeah, you get filthy rich.

126
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:35,939
- [Jeremy] Filthy rich, can Mom do it?

127
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:38,606
(wheel turning)

128
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:48,772
What happened?

129
00:04:48,772 --> 00:04:50,907
- I found gold, but other miners stole it.

130
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,172
Oh what happened to Janae?

131
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:55,012
- The California gold rush
was not good for our family.

132
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:55,845
Let's press on.

133
00:04:55,845 --> 00:04:59,012
(bright guitar music)

134
00:05:02,611 --> 00:05:04,688
- Do we want the mule or the oxen?

135
00:05:04,688 --> 00:05:05,521
- Oxen.

136
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,354
- Oxen.

137
00:05:06,354 --> 00:05:07,187
- Well let's listen to the pros and cons.

138
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:09,572
So for the mules, they
pull faster than oxen.

139
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:10,891
They can be trained in a short time.

140
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,394
They're stronger, they
ate less than horses.

141
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,843
There we go Isaac for the ox.

142
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:17,850
Alright Elise, mule or ox?

143
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,905
- But these eat less.

144
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,731
- So all the boys voted for oxen,

145
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:23,114
All the girls voted for mules.

146
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,001
- I want to get there fast,

147
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:26,538
that was my primary motivation.

148
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,018
So this is a very famous picture

149
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,281
their shaking hands,

150
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:31,200
because they're connecting one side

151
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,436
of the country's railroad,

152
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,994
with the other side of
the country's railroad.

153
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:36,788
So that now people could
go straight across.

154
00:05:36,788 --> 00:05:39,054
- [Elise] These are buffalo chips.

155
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:41,177
- So the gift shop has
buffalo chip Frisbee's.

156
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:43,339
- I didn't realize they were
Frisbee's, that's awesome.

157
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,411
- Yeah that is.

158
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:46,054
I'm glad Caleb seems to be feeling better.

159
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,450
- We're getting ready
to go on a wagon ride,

160
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:48,993
we're just waiting on
the wagon to get here.

161
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:52,076
(epic pioneer music)

162
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,255
(laughing)

163
00:05:57,255 --> 00:06:00,255
(playful babbling)

164
00:06:02,951 --> 00:06:06,201
(horses clip clopping)

165
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:11,197
(laughing)

166
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,959
- Are we going to die?

167
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,851
- [Jeremy] Are we gonna die on the wagon?

168
00:06:17,851 --> 00:06:19,561
Nope, this one's just for fun.

169
00:06:19,561 --> 00:06:21,164
- This one's just a little short ride,

170
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:22,894
like we're just gonna go
around the town a little bit,

171
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,419
so we can see what it feels
like to be in a wagon.

172
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,618
- Whoa Bill, we have some
rough enough pioneers here?

173
00:06:29,618 --> 00:06:31,208
- [Jeremy] Yep.

174
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,370
- [Driver] Climb in
pioneers, around the back,

175
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,954
the trips only gonna take
us five and a half miles.

176
00:06:35,954 --> 00:06:36,787
- Oh goodie.
- Okay.

177
00:06:36,787 --> 00:06:38,906
- [Driver] This is the original motor home

178
00:06:38,906 --> 00:06:40,739
right here, young'uns.

179
00:06:42,499 --> 00:06:44,528
Come on up here so I can
tell you a tall tale.

180
00:06:44,528 --> 00:06:45,528
- Wagons ho.

181
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:49,267
- [Jeremy] Are we going fast?

182
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:52,100
- [Driver] Yeah Bill, giddyup yup.

183
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:56,392
- This is right where the wagons went.

184
00:06:56,392 --> 00:06:57,868
- [Driver] What do you want
to do when you grow up?

185
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:58,895
- I don't know yet.

186
00:06:58,895 --> 00:06:59,728
- [Driver] You don't know yet?

187
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,718
Well you gotta find a dream,
do you know why you do?

188
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:05,109
- One time, one time I had a scary dream.

189
00:07:05,109 --> 00:07:06,003
- Did you have a scary dream?

190
00:07:06,003 --> 00:07:07,460
(laughing)

191
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,826
Yeah well we're not
talking about those kind.

192
00:07:09,826 --> 00:07:11,075
You gotta find a dream,

193
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:12,259
because without a dream,

194
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,779
nobody can help you.

195
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,948
Children, you gotta find
something you're passionate about,

196
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:20,143
or called to and go after it.

197
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:23,060
That is what made our nation great,

198
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:26,784
people that followed their dreams.

199
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:27,617
- [Jeremy] Do you guys see that,

200
00:07:27,617 --> 00:07:29,910
the mules have diapers?

201
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,286
They have poop bags.

202
00:07:31,286 --> 00:07:35,104
- [Driver] Yeah, those are
actually where I keep my M & M's.

203
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:37,067
- [Jeremy] One, two, three.

204
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:37,900
(camera snaps)

205
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,067
(lively guitar music)

206
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,581
Oh.

207
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:48,982
- [Tour Guide] Here it comes.

208
00:07:48,982 --> 00:07:49,815
- It's going faster.

209
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,623
- [Tour Guide] It's going
through another tunnel.

210
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:53,456
There it goes.

211
00:07:53,456 --> 00:07:54,289
- Did you guys see these?

212
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:55,272
These are telegraphs.

213
00:07:55,272 --> 00:07:57,534
- Let me show you how one works.

214
00:07:57,534 --> 00:07:59,166
See this one's hooked up,

215
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,974
and they used to send messages.

216
00:08:01,974 --> 00:08:03,839
They didn't have telephones
back in those days.

217
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,961
- One after another,
the laden wagons rolled

218
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,368
from the crowded square

219
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:10,243
We're headed out to find
the real wagon ruts.

220
00:08:10,243 --> 00:08:11,477
They're called wagon swales,

221
00:08:11,477 --> 00:08:13,224
because they've been grassed over,

222
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:14,564
but they're supposed to be
right here on this property.

223
00:08:14,564 --> 00:08:15,461
I don't know why that's so cool to me.

224
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,401
It's just crazy to think 170 years ago,

225
00:08:17,401 --> 00:08:19,294
what was happening right here.

226
00:08:19,294 --> 00:08:20,776
Basically I'm a history nerd.

227
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,930
- I'm amazed with how fast
our technology's changing.

228
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,492
Like I think it's important for our kids

229
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,453
to see what happened and to
learn the lessons from history.

230
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:28,964
We shouldn't forget.

231
00:08:28,964 --> 00:08:30,631
We should remember these things

232
00:08:30,631 --> 00:08:31,887
and learn from them.

233
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,279
- Things that helped shape our country.

234
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,112
- Yeah.

235
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:36,809
- In and out of town,

236
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:41,354
the heavy and continuous
wagon traffic left its mark.

237
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,385
So right there, if there was a wagon

238
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:43,850
it would've been going up.

239
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,850
- Wagons ho!

240
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,063
- So on the way home, we found this park

241
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,689
that we wanted to stop at
and play with the kids.

242
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:55,272
(bright music)

243
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,688
(yelling)

244
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:05,625
- Whoa.

245
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,299
(clanking metal)

246
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,060
- See if you can recognize this song.

247
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,060
(playing xylophone)

248
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:31,868
(Janae cooing)

249
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:34,102
(playing xylophone)

250
00:09:34,102 --> 00:09:36,685
(lively music)

251
00:09:42,344 --> 00:09:43,379
(yelling)

252
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,697
(Kendra laughs)

253
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:46,498
- She likes when I whistle.

254
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:47,600
(whistling)

255
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,081
- [Kendra] She likes
that you're feeding her.

256
00:09:49,081 --> 00:09:50,431
Elise likes to feed Janae

257
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:53,431
and Janae likes to be fed by Elise.

258
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:54,264
- That's all.

259
00:09:54,264 --> 00:09:56,067
(yelling)

260
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,752
- So we're eating lunch as a family

261
00:09:57,752 --> 00:09:59,687
and we're playing Scrabble

262
00:09:59,687 --> 00:10:01,160
that is on the back of our Cheez-It box.

263
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,538
So check it out, these
words are scrambled up.

264
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:04,371
And we figured out all of them,

265
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,840
except for the first one,

266
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,880
and we cannot figure it out.

267
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,713
It's funny when I got the ones

268
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:09,284
on the bottom, it's like
you feel so accomplished,

269
00:10:09,284 --> 00:10:10,788
you're like yeah, I figured it out,

270
00:10:10,788 --> 00:10:11,621
and then I can't figure out the top one

271
00:10:11,621 --> 00:10:12,454
and I'm like, oh.

272
00:10:12,454 --> 00:10:14,280
Any luck boys?

273
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,711
- I think that's rotator.
- Did we crack the code?

274
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:18,252
- [Kendra] Okay, so what's this one?

275
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:19,785
- [Isaac] Toy.

276
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,315
Boat.

277
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,504
Jump.

278
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:23,337
Play.

279
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:25,772
- [Kendra] Jeremy and
I both know this one,

280
00:10:25,772 --> 00:10:27,249
the boys haven't figured it out yet.

281
00:10:27,249 --> 00:10:29,962
But Jeremy and I cannot
figure out this one.

282
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,284
What is it?

283
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:33,034
Do you guys like word games like this?

284
00:10:33,034 --> 00:10:33,867
I really enjoy them,

285
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:34,792
until they drive me crazy

286
00:10:34,792 --> 00:10:36,112
because I can't figure them out.

287
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:37,881
Jeremy's getting serious about this.

288
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:41,411
- It's wierd that there's
just a U and an E.

289
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,683
This is rough.

290
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,238
Wait, I gotta figure this out.

291
00:10:44,238 --> 00:10:45,502
- [Kendra] Oh man, we're
gonna feel so silly

292
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:46,357
when we discover it,

293
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,027
because it can't be that hard of a word.

294
00:10:48,027 --> 00:10:50,450
It's on a Scrabble Junior box.

295
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,515
I did it, I did it, I figured it out.

296
00:10:52,515 --> 00:10:55,786
I know the answer and
Jeremy doesn't ba ha ha.

297
00:10:55,786 --> 00:10:57,490
I literally was like screaming

298
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,442
and jumping up and down,

299
00:10:58,442 --> 00:10:59,635
when all of a sudden I saw it.

300
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,462
I was like, I know the word!

301
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,295
- Lutter?

302
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:06,630
Like butter, but with an L.

303
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,463
Ret letru

304
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,173
(laughing)

305
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:13,441
There's two T's an R and an L.

306
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:15,858
- [Kendra] This is hard, huh.

307
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:20,973
(laughing)

308
00:11:20,973 --> 00:11:22,056
Isaac got it.

309
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:24,341
- He said it loud,

310
00:11:24,341 --> 00:11:27,259
so I only had to feel the shame

311
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,748
of not figure it out.

312
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:29,857
- [Kendra] What's the word?

313
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:30,853
- Turtle.

314
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:33,149
- Turtle!
- Turtle!

315
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:35,399
- [Jeremy] Kendra did you
see what just arrived?

316
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,232
Two.

317
00:11:36,232 --> 00:11:37,069
(gasps)

318
00:11:37,069 --> 00:11:37,902
Two boxes.

319
00:11:37,902 --> 00:11:39,347
- I'm so excited about both of these.

320
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:40,180
- [Jeremy] I know.

321
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,422
- This is the best mail day ever.

322
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:44,592
Okay, so one of those is
going to be our new bench

323
00:11:44,592 --> 00:11:47,698
that is going to change our kitchen table.

324
00:11:47,698 --> 00:11:48,531
I'm so excited,

325
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,581
and the other is my Stitch Fix,

326
00:11:50,581 --> 00:11:52,322
which you guys don't know what that is,

327
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:54,255
but it is a box of new clothes for Mommy.

328
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,248
- [Jeremy] Not sponsored.

329
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,081
- Not sponsored at all,

330
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:57,370
I'm just so excited to try it.

331
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,269
New clothes without shopping, I'm in.

332
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:03,261
Caleb, I have some bad news.

333
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:06,205
We have to build the bench.

334
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,046
It doesn't come already put together,

335
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:08,879
so we have to open the box and build it.

336
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,079
- We're gonna need someone who
can put it together for us.

337
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:12,912
- Ahhh.

338
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:14,855
(laughing)

339
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,350
- How tall is it?

340
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,255
- [Kendra] It's the
right size for a bench.

341
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:22,021
- [Jeremy] To go to our
table, our kitchen table.

342
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:24,267
So we were considering
getting a new kitchen table,

343
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,096
'cause now we have more than six of us

344
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:27,894
in the family,

345
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:29,153
then we realized we
could just get a bench.

346
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:32,041
Kendra found a bench for
like 58 or $60 dollars?

347
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,874
- [Kendra] Yeah.

348
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:34,416
- Problem solved.

349
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,249
- Yeah.

350
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:36,349
So now we can have three kids

351
00:12:36,349 --> 00:12:39,052
sitting on the bench and it'll fit.

352
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,133
It's funny the things
you get excited about

353
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,038
when you're a mom.

354
00:12:42,038 --> 00:12:44,159
Like I'm so excited
about this kitchen bench.

355
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,992
Woo!

356
00:12:46,242 --> 00:12:47,736
What are we having for dinner?

357
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:48,653
- Pancakes.

358
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:52,668
(jazzy upbeat music)

359
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,003
- So last month, I got into a bad habit

360
00:12:58,003 --> 00:12:59,466
of us eating out more.

361
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,984
I just was having a hard
time with meal planning

362
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:01,856
and grocery shopping

363
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,640
and it just felt easier and simpler,

364
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,912
but I'm working really hard on that,

365
00:13:04,912 --> 00:13:07,436
and so I've been trying
really hard to plan ahead,

366
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:08,444
but I don't always do that,

367
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:09,601
so I always have some back ups,

368
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:11,433
super fast meals that I just know,

369
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,563
if I forget to plan ahead,

370
00:13:12,563 --> 00:13:13,396
I can do last minute.

371
00:13:13,396 --> 00:13:16,129
Like tonight, so we're doing pancakes.

372
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,730
Which I know is not super healthy

373
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,705
or an amazing dinner at all,

374
00:13:19,705 --> 00:13:21,225
but it works, and I can get it

375
00:13:21,225 --> 00:13:22,223
on the table in like 15 minutes,

376
00:13:22,223 --> 00:13:23,779
and my kids actually eat it really well.

377
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:26,196
So pancakes for dinner it is.

378
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,941
♫ The sun and the rain and the apple seeds

379
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,491
♫ The Lord's been good to me

380
00:13:34,491 --> 00:13:36,130
♫ Dun dun dun

381
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:37,418
- So when I'm feeding a lot of the kids

382
00:13:37,418 --> 00:13:39,883
something like pancakes or waffles

383
00:13:39,883 --> 00:13:41,883
or anything that takes
individual preparation

384
00:13:41,883 --> 00:13:44,511
for each one, I tend to
just use a Tupperware,

385
00:13:44,511 --> 00:13:46,793
rip it all up, stick the
syrup and peanut butter

386
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,697
or whatever I want, inside the Tupperware,

387
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:51,115
shake it up and then it's ready to go

388
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:52,601
for everyone all at once.

389
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:54,129
(uptempo dance music)

390
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,046
Is it good?

391
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:57,347
- So during Janae's nap,

392
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:58,652
I opened my Stitch Fix box

393
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,646
and I tried on the
clothes that came in it.

394
00:14:00,646 --> 00:14:02,669
While I really liked some pieces,

395
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:03,840
other pieces are just okay,

396
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,090
and overall, they were
all just much pricier,

397
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,649
than the clothes that I usually buy.

398
00:14:08,649 --> 00:14:10,319
So I'm glad I tried it.

399
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,735
I'm definitely going to try it again,

400
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:12,870
but I don't know if this is gonna be

401
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,830
a long term solution for me,

402
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,580
just because of how
cheap I am about clothes.

403
00:14:18,487 --> 00:14:20,991
(laughing)

404
00:14:20,991 --> 00:14:22,407
- [Jeremy] Lise, you
getting ready for ballet.

405
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:23,240
- Yeah.

406
00:14:24,423 --> 00:14:26,712
- [Caleb] Goodnight, J House out.

407
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,327
- Good morning friends,
three years ago today,

408
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:31,902
September 18th, 2014,

409
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:36,183
was the first time we ever
posted a J House vlog,

410
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:37,647
so I'm gonna put in the description box

411
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,505
some of our favorite vlogs over the years

412
00:14:39,505 --> 00:00:00,000
and I'm gonna start today's
video with our original intro.
