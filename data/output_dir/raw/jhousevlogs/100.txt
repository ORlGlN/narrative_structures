1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,193
- Can our neighbors hear us?

2
00:00:02,193 --> 00:00:04,110
- [Jeremy] Pretty good.

3
00:00:09,316 --> 00:00:10,686
There's our pallets.

4
00:00:10,686 --> 00:00:12,436
- We need a forklift.

5
00:00:16,991 --> 00:00:19,403
- [Jeremy] What's for
breakfast today Mono?

6
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:21,076
Did we do cream of wheat?

7
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:21,909
- Hum.

8
00:00:21,909 --> 00:00:25,629
- [Jeremy] You guys nene has
a pretty bad cold coming on,

9
00:00:25,629 --> 00:00:27,998
she's all snotty.

10
00:00:27,998 --> 00:00:31,665
She didn't sleep super well.

11
00:00:33,446 --> 00:00:36,446
(fast upbeat music)

12
00:00:43,889 --> 00:00:45,348
- Whatcha doing cub?

13
00:00:45,348 --> 00:00:47,503
- I am getting ready for scouts.

14
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:49,528
- [Jeremy] You want to be just
like your big brother huh.

15
00:00:49,528 --> 00:00:50,914
Is this your scout shirt?

16
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:53,245
Right here, wearing it inside out?

17
00:00:53,245 --> 00:00:54,639
- Yeah, I could just couldn't

18
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:57,444
find anything blue so I just
did something inside out.

19
00:00:57,444 --> 00:00:59,210
What are handkerchiefs?

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:02,085
- [Jeremy] People used to
use them to blow their nose.

21
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:03,954
And scouts use them as ties.

22
00:01:03,954 --> 00:01:04,787
- Cool.

23
00:01:04,787 --> 00:01:06,271
- [Jeremy] Are you a boy scout?

24
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:07,104
- Yep.

25
00:01:10,089 --> 00:01:11,502
- I used to know how to do this

26
00:01:11,502 --> 00:01:12,875
when I was a scout but I can't remember

27
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:14,101
exactly how it works.

28
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,133
- [Jeremy] So why are you
all dressed up this morning?

29
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,507
- For the pine wood derby.

30
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:18,628
- [Jeremy] Pine wood derby.

31
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:19,693
Whatcha making?

32
00:01:19,693 --> 00:01:22,900
- I'm getting ready for
the pinewood derby today.

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,409
- [Jeremy] Are you putting stuff

34
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,177
on your shoulders like a boy scout?

35
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,997
- I have to be ready for boy scouts.

36
00:01:27,997 --> 00:01:30,580
(upbeat music)

37
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:40,667
- [Jeremy] Alright, I think we got it.

38
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,858
It's pretty good, pretty good.

39
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:43,917
Looking good.

40
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,694
Did Elise help you out?

41
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:49,395
- Presenting Caleb the scout.

42
00:01:49,395 --> 00:01:51,168
Kid.

43
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,251
- Thanks for helping him.

44
00:01:56,108 --> 00:01:57,912
Well I'm feeling really bad,

45
00:01:57,912 --> 00:01:58,801
we tested it out.

46
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:00,852
And the car is barely able to make it down

47
00:02:00,852 --> 00:02:04,689
the track so we might
lose every single event.

48
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:07,106
(fast music)

49
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:21,390
- [Announcer] Three, two, one.

50
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:24,742
Go, and in the

51
00:02:24,742 --> 00:02:27,908
lane number two takes the victory.

52
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:29,325
Oh, that's close.

53
00:02:41,012 --> 00:02:42,311
Lane number one.

54
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:45,193
Ladies and gentlemen, judges are ready.

55
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:47,791
- Well Issac's car did terrible.

56
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:51,874
We lost every race by a lot.

57
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:54,462
We barely made it down the track

58
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:56,682
and I feel terrible as a Dad.

59
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:59,368
Because I wanted to help
him make a good track

60
00:02:59,368 --> 00:03:00,676
and it's a lot more fun

61
00:03:00,676 --> 00:03:03,466
when you win but it is
important to lean how to lose.

62
00:03:03,466 --> 00:03:04,664
And Issac was pretty upset,

63
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:06,039
he was really sad.

64
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,903
But he took it really well,

65
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:09,174
and he wanted to come back in

66
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:11,230
and cheer for his friends and I was really

67
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,553
proud of him for choosing to do that

68
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:15,470
and being a good sport.

69
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:20,201
- That was fast.

70
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,804
- [Jeremy] Good job buddy.

71
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:28,994
So how are you feeling

72
00:03:28,994 --> 00:03:30,274
about the pinewood derby?

73
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:31,525
- Pretty disappointed.

74
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:33,455
- [Jeremy] So what do
you want to do next year?

75
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,335
- Do a wedge.

76
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:36,008
- [Jeremy] Yeah, a simple design.

77
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:36,841
- Uh huh.

78
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,674
- [Jeremy] I think

79
00:03:37,674 --> 00:03:39,245
that's a good idea.

80
00:03:39,245 --> 00:03:42,078
(classical music)

81
00:03:56,463 --> 00:03:57,846
- [Jeremy] Where we going?

82
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:58,957
- To heart to heart.

83
00:03:58,957 --> 00:04:01,540
(upbeat music)

84
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,368
- Oh, there's a dog.

85
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:21,838
- So we're here at the headquarters

86
00:04:21,838 --> 00:04:22,917
for Heart to Heart

87
00:04:22,917 --> 00:04:24,842
and they have a dog in their office

88
00:04:24,842 --> 00:04:26,661
which is like the coolest thing.

89
00:04:26,661 --> 00:04:27,806
So we initially drove

90
00:04:27,806 --> 00:04:28,639
to the headquarters

91
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:29,751
of Heart to Heart

92
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:30,940
but their operations hub

93
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,857
is just up the road so
we're heading there now.

94
00:04:36,932 --> 00:04:38,859
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

95
00:04:38,859 --> 00:04:41,736
- [Man] This is your safety equipment.

96
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:42,852
- [Jeremy] Oh good.

97
00:04:42,852 --> 00:04:44,243
- And we have some
equipment for Issac okay.

98
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,479
- [Jeremy] There you go.

99
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:46,312
Issac.

100
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:47,145
- Cool.

101
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,221
- There you go.

102
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:50,675
- [Jeremy] Gotta keep it safe.

103
00:04:50,675 --> 00:04:52,600
- [Man] You're welcome.

104
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,058
- It says Heart to Heart.

105
00:04:54,058 --> 00:04:56,269
- Since Laura's gone, I'm using hers.

106
00:04:56,269 --> 00:04:58,365
- Now do you guys know
where Puerto Rico is?

107
00:04:58,365 --> 00:04:59,232
- Yes.
- No.

108
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,858
- Let's go look and see alright.

109
00:05:00,858 --> 00:05:03,564
- So we just heard that one
of the pallets that we did

110
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:05,373
at out service celebration

111
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,148
has already been sent off to Puerto Rico.

112
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:10,377
And a couple of them are
getting ready to leave soon.

113
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:11,210
- There.

114
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,120
- Very good, that's
excellent so Puerto Rico

115
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,999
is way down here where my finger is okay.

116
00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:17,282
You know it as Pico de Gallo.

117
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:19,533
Here's a map of the island.

118
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,363
And you see anything familiar on there?

119
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,351
- The J.

120
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,184
J house.

121
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:25,039
- That's right.

122
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,981
So it's called Carolina.

123
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,977
That is were your palette

124
00:05:28,977 --> 00:05:32,040
of hygiene kits are today okay.

125
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,098
- So we're going to try

126
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:33,931
to find our other

127
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:36,474
palettes today in the warehouse.

128
00:05:36,474 --> 00:05:39,057
(upbeat music)

129
00:05:48,755 --> 00:05:51,012
- This box weighs eight pounds.

130
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:52,639
It's 2.1 cubic feet.

131
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,378
For such a little box.

132
00:05:54,378 --> 00:05:56,278
- I've written down every place

133
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:59,075
in this entire warehouse

134
00:05:59,075 --> 00:06:02,307
where your hygiene kits are.

135
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:03,900
- [Jeremy] Be looking for it.

136
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,080
- [Man] Just be looking okay.

137
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,009
- [Jeremy] We were in row 51.

138
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:08,677
But what row is she in?

139
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,511
- 52.

140
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:11,781
- [Jeremy] Let's see if we can find 52.

141
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:13,126
And then it's 15.

142
00:06:13,126 --> 00:06:13,983
- Found it.

143
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:15,979
- [Man] Way to go Elise.

144
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:17,728
- [Jeremy] We found it.

145
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:19,207
- [Man] Let's work together

146
00:06:19,207 --> 00:06:20,141
on the others okay.

147
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:21,201
- [Jeremy] Three and four.

148
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
- Found it.

149
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,436
- [Jeremy] Good job.

150
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:24,299
- Found it.

151
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:25,635
- [Man] Hey, good.

152
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,540
- [Jeremy] You got it too!

153
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,130
There's our palettes.

154
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,555
- While Jeremy is on his errand,

155
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,715
with the big kids I'm home

156
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:32,721
with Laura and Janae.

157
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,408
And Janae's napping so Laura and I

158
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:36,328
are getting to have some
special one on one time.

159
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:38,120
We're working on puzzles
and I'm doing lots

160
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,903
and lots of laundry because

161
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:41,497
we are getting packed

162
00:06:41,497 --> 00:06:43,703
because we are going to be
going somewhere on a trip.

163
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:45,744
Our friends don't know where we're going.

164
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:48,127
Yep, that's where we're going
but they don't know that.

165
00:06:48,127 --> 00:06:48,960
- I know.

166
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,045
- It's a secret.

167
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:50,878
Shu.

168
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,852
So in the comments, I would love to hear

169
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:53,746
your guesses.

170
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,605
The only hint that I'll give you is we are

171
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:58,349
going to see people who you've already met

172
00:06:58,349 --> 00:06:59,522
in our Vlogs before.

173
00:06:59,522 --> 00:07:01,252
Alright, so poll question.

174
00:07:01,252 --> 00:07:02,652
How do you think we are
going to be traveling.

175
00:07:02,652 --> 00:07:03,863
Up here let us know.

176
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:06,182
Are we going to be
traveling by plane or by car

177
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:07,856
or by boat or by train

178
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:08,716
or by bike.

179
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,554
How do you think we're going to get

180
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:12,548
to where we're going?

181
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:13,620
Where do you think we're going?

182
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,703
And who do you think we're going to see?

183
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,014
And we'd love to hear
if you're traveling for

184
00:07:16,014 --> 00:07:17,859
Thanksgiving and where you are going.

185
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:20,500
Alright Laura is dying and
she has to tell the secret.

186
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,732
Where are we going?

187
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,484
So Janae is actually not
feeling very well today.

188
00:07:24,484 --> 00:07:27,102
She's got lots of boogers going on,

189
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:29,006
we've been wiping her nose constantly.

190
00:07:29,006 --> 00:07:30,386
And suctioning boogers out.

191
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:32,175
She hasn't been too fussy

192
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:33,457
but she has been pretty clingy.

193
00:07:33,457 --> 00:07:36,040
So we'll make it through today.

194
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:48,153
- [Jeremy] So this is like

195
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:50,226
a mobile hospital or medical place

196
00:07:50,226 --> 00:07:52,283
and they took this down to Houston

197
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,909
and Florida during the hurricanes.

198
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,631
If there is a huge storm

199
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:58,177
and all the hospitals are closed down

200
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,534
or there's problems with
the hospitals, where do

201
00:08:00,534 --> 00:08:01,970
all those people go?

202
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:02,803
- Here.

203
00:08:02,803 --> 00:08:04,374
- [Jeremy] What happens to their medicine?

204
00:08:04,374 --> 00:08:05,961
There's just a need there and

205
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,601
so heart to heart is trained

206
00:08:07,601 --> 00:08:09,674
to help people with their medical needs

207
00:08:09,674 --> 00:08:11,029
when there's a disaster.

208
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,807
Hopefully there's no keys in there.

209
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:15,525
- [Woman] No there's not.

210
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,425
- [Jeremy] You guys off to

211
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:19,023
take care of people in trouble?

212
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:21,449
- Yep, we're gonna drive away.

213
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:22,391
Wee.

214
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:24,665
- I'm glad I weighed all of you,

215
00:08:24,665 --> 00:08:26,076
now I know exactly.

216
00:08:26,076 --> 00:08:27,872
- So we're gonna radio for

217
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,625
a forklift to come and move out palette,

218
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,751
wrap it and get it ready

219
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:31,959
to ship out to Puerto Rico.

220
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,205
- Mr. Rick are you there?

221
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:34,842
- [Rick] Yes, go ahead.

222
00:08:34,842 --> 00:08:36,493
- We need a forklift.

223
00:08:36,493 --> 00:08:38,841
- 418 B and 318 B.

224
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:41,674
- [Jeremy] The forklift is coming.

225
00:08:53,127 --> 00:08:53,960
Oh.

226
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,868
- Can we weigh and wrap it?

227
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,010
- Alrighty, I'll go over to the wrapper

228
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,760
and you can follow me over there.

229
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:11,786
We're gonna spread it over the top there.

230
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:13,703
Put some tape on there.

231
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,551
- Could I get wrapped up?

232
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,519
- [Jeremy] And we'll ship
you off to Puerto Rico?

233
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,352
- Yes.

234
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:27,447
- [Man] Perfect.

235
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:28,643
- Give a hug to the palette.

236
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,184
Okay, poll question.

237
00:09:30,184 --> 00:09:32,194
How much do you think it weighs you guys?

238
00:09:32,194 --> 00:09:33,958
Don't look first, what do you think?

239
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,791
- 200.

240
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,215
- [Jeremy] 200 pounds?

241
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:37,888
- Maybe 46?

242
00:09:37,888 --> 00:09:41,039
- [Jeremy] 46 pounds.

243
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,349
- Well if there are 30 boxes, 1,200.

244
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:46,243
- [Jeremy] 1,200 pounds?

245
00:09:46,243 --> 00:09:48,841
- Let's come and see how much it weighs.

246
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,862
I didn't hold one of the boxes so that

247
00:09:51,862 --> 00:09:52,867
is a disadvantage.

248
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,527
I'm gonna go with 1,500 pounds.

249
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,959
So it was 550 pounds.

250
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:58,792
- Hi Don.

251
00:09:58,792 --> 00:10:01,959
- How's it going yo.

252
00:10:06,256 --> 00:10:08,336
- [Kendra] Laura's been really
getting into puzzles lately

253
00:10:08,336 --> 00:10:10,373
and I love that she can sit
quietly ad play with them

254
00:10:10,373 --> 00:10:12,773
for a little bit.

255
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:13,625
Did you do it?

256
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,917
- Yes.

257
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:15,814
- Good work.

258
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:17,396
You did all four of these.

259
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:21,563
- [Jeremy] We're playing
follow the leader with Nene.

260
00:10:24,294 --> 00:10:25,403
Do it with her.

261
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:27,867
(baby gurgling)

262
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:30,357
(kids gurgling)

263
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:32,408
We've done this with all of our kids

264
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:34,893
where we play follow the leader with them

265
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,591
tapping on the table.

266
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:37,591
It's so fun.

267
00:10:39,144 --> 00:10:41,312
- Can our neighbors hear us?

268
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:43,976
- [Jeremy] I don't think they can hear us.

269
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,063
- Good night, J House out.

270
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:46,896
- Hi guys.

271
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,479
- [Kendra] Hi guys.

272
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:52,675
- I wanted to weigh this.

273
00:10:52,675 --> 00:10:55,616
- Tonight is bring your
parent to ballet night.

274
00:10:55,616 --> 00:00:00,000
- What if our house was made out of candy?
