1
00:00:00,218 --> 00:00:02,134
- [Kendra] Do you remember
when you auditioned?

2
00:00:02,134 --> 00:00:05,217
(bright dance music)

3
00:00:07,269 --> 00:00:08,102
- What?

4
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:10,177
- Oh look.

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:11,282
- It's pretend flying.

6
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:14,449
- [Jeremy] It's pretend flying, Caleb.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,923
♫ You are there, you are there

8
00:00:19,923 --> 00:00:23,006
♫ I see where we are

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,590
(bluesy rock music)

10
00:00:52,194 --> 00:00:55,694
(soaring classical music)

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,857
(funky electronic music)

12
00:01:09,614 --> 00:01:10,590
So about once a year we come

13
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,958
to the Science Museum here in Kansas City.

14
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,278
And they always have new features,

15
00:01:14,278 --> 00:01:16,535
so the kids love it.

16
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:18,702
(yelling)

17
00:01:20,926 --> 00:01:22,093
There's Isaac.

18
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,637
He's up there.

19
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:27,551
(singing)

20
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:30,051
(piano notes)

21
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:33,505
It's like a crazy illusion, huh?

22
00:01:33,505 --> 00:01:34,738
- How did they do that?

23
00:01:34,738 --> 00:01:35,880
- [Jeremy] It's an illusion.

24
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,244
- What's an illusion?

25
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:39,709
- [Jeremy] It tricks your brain.

26
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:42,376
(playful music)

27
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,500
It looks like you're flying.

28
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,137
(laughing)

29
00:01:50,137 --> 00:01:51,054
- Oh look.

30
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:54,633
(groans)

31
00:01:54,633 --> 00:01:56,883
(laughing)

32
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,114
- Ja!

33
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:09,597
(laughing)

34
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:12,597
(funky dance music)

35
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:38,891
- [Jeremy] Oh.

36
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:40,658
Whoa.

37
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,592
Whoa!
(squealing)

38
00:02:48,592 --> 00:02:51,605
- Oh yeah, I have to make a circuit first.

39
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:54,111
- [Jeremy] Gotta make a circuit.

40
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:54,944
- [Elise] Huh.

41
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:55,777
- I got it.

42
00:02:55,777 --> 00:02:57,324
- [Jeremy] You got it to work?

43
00:02:57,324 --> 00:02:58,721
(circuits turning)

44
00:02:58,721 --> 00:02:59,554
Good job.

45
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,617
- Yay!

46
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:06,438
- [Jeremy] You made it all the way.

47
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:07,271
(yelling)

48
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,727
You want to slowly get it going,

49
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:12,654
get it going faster and faster.

50
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:13,487
Good job.

51
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:20,086
I love how fast your feet are going.

52
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:24,441
(whirring)

53
00:03:30,582 --> 00:03:33,207
- It's not actually flying.

54
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:34,391
It's pretend flying.

55
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,888
- [Jeremy] It's pretend flying Caleb.

56
00:03:35,888 --> 00:03:37,594
- [Laura] Yeah Caleb.

57
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:38,511
- Let's go.

58
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,358
(singing)

59
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:53,482
- [Jeremy] So taking Laura to the bathroom

60
00:03:53,482 --> 00:03:55,225
has been super hard,

61
00:03:55,225 --> 00:03:58,673
because she wore her
swimsuit under her clothes,

62
00:03:58,673 --> 00:04:00,314
you little goose.

63
00:04:00,314 --> 00:04:02,210
- I won't need to go soon.

64
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,556
- [Jeremy] I know.

65
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:06,556
(bluesy rock music)

66
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:26,196
It changes the light elevation, huh?

67
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:29,051
- It's disappeared.
- It's gone.

68
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:29,884
- So the kids think they can beat me

69
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,322
in this tug of war.

70
00:04:31,322 --> 00:04:34,686
It's set up to where their
side is easier than my side.

71
00:04:34,686 --> 00:04:36,285
Go!

72
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,118
No!

73
00:04:37,118 --> 00:04:38,360
(bell dings)

74
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,032
Oh.
(cheering)

75
00:04:40,032 --> 00:04:43,044
Maybe it is, I do have
Laura on my team though.

76
00:04:43,044 --> 00:04:43,951
(yells)

77
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,328
(Jeremy laughs)

78
00:04:46,328 --> 00:04:47,161
(yells)

79
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,078
(funky beat music)

80
00:04:51,534 --> 00:04:52,617
This is cool.

81
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,376
Laura and Lise, good job.

82
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:06,699
- [Caleb] Well that's cool.

83
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:08,032
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

84
00:05:10,298 --> 00:05:12,548
Okay Isaac, go lift 'em up.

85
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,445
On your mark, get set, go.

86
00:05:17,499 --> 00:05:20,582
(funky groove music)

87
00:05:22,527 --> 00:05:24,511
(yells)

88
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:25,844
How did that go?

89
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,384
- Woo hoo.

90
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,607
Why is this trying to escape me.

91
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,832
- [Jeremy] You won't fall out, it's safe.

92
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,883
It looks like climbing on chips.

93
00:05:35,883 --> 00:05:38,210
He's up at the top.

94
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,793
- Woo, this is fun.

95
00:05:43,346 --> 00:05:46,513
(tropical beat music)

96
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,573
- [Jeremy] That's a skunk, does it stink?

97
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:55,406
- No.

98
00:06:01,109 --> 00:06:03,250
- [Jeremy] What do you see?

99
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,167
- Dinosaur.

100
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,261
- I'm in the middle.

101
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,804
- [Caleb] I'm in the middle.

102
00:06:16,804 --> 00:06:19,971
(gentle guitar music)

103
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:26,059
- Look they're actually working in there.

104
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:27,132
So this is a cool section.

105
00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,010
They actually have meteorologists

106
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,708
working on projects while the kids

107
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,272
are looking at their work.

108
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:34,105
- That's a real fossil.

109
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,546
It's a brow horn.

110
00:06:35,546 --> 00:06:37,267
- [Jeremy] It's a real fossil.

111
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:38,621
- Oh it's one of those?
- Yeah.

112
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:40,057
- [Jeremy] It's a horn?

113
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:40,890
- Now,

114
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,723
- That's big.

115
00:06:41,723 --> 00:06:42,851
- The unique thing about it,

116
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:45,420
it's from a baby triceratops.

117
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,759
- [Jeremy] So a baby
triceratops fossil of a horn

118
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,842
is what the kids are holding.

119
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:53,950
- This is 65 million years.
- Right.

120
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,344
- [Jeremy] What'd you find?

121
00:06:55,344 --> 00:06:57,480
- I don't know, but it has these.

122
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,410
- [Jeremy] Whoa, those look like ribs.

123
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,571
- Yeah.

124
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:03,867
(bright uptempo music)

125
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:05,752
- [Jeremy] Close your eyes.

126
00:07:05,752 --> 00:07:07,528
- [Man] Put your hand beside you,

127
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,168
see, look how it stays behind.

128
00:07:09,168 --> 00:07:10,144
- What?

129
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:12,561
- [Jeremy] Your shadow stays.

130
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:15,520
Okay, now move away.

131
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,606
- Oh mine's here.

132
00:07:16,606 --> 00:07:18,262
- Whoa.

133
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:20,798
(whirling ball)

134
00:07:20,798 --> 00:07:21,631
- That was no.

135
00:07:21,631 --> 00:07:23,675
- [Jeremy] Okay, we're trying
to get it in the middle.

136
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:25,223
- I did it.

137
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,973
- [Jeremy] She has it in the middle.

138
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:28,806
Oh.

139
00:07:28,806 --> 00:07:30,001
Don't let your little finger

140
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,487
get stuck in here though.

141
00:07:32,487 --> 00:07:33,487
There it is.

142
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:40,548
- I made a walkie talkie.

143
00:07:40,548 --> 00:07:42,026
- [Jeremy] How cool, does it work?

144
00:07:42,026 --> 00:07:44,644
- Hello, anybody here?

145
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:46,068
- So these are whisper dishes

146
00:07:46,068 --> 00:07:47,700
where you can hear from all the way

147
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,469
across the room.

148
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,021
- But how can I hear you?

149
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:54,271
(uptempo lively music)

150
00:07:57,773 --> 00:07:59,690
- This is a good phone!

151
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,859
- [Jeremy] That is cool.

152
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,807
- And then when you're
done, it's like spikey.

153
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:11,390
(rousing electronic music)

154
00:08:18,045 --> 00:08:20,277
- It's funny how this
place has all these frills

155
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,060
and amazing things to do.

156
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,677
And my favorite thing has been just

157
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,510
building with my kids.

158
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,114
It's super creative.

159
00:08:28,114 --> 00:08:29,524
So what'd you think of building?

160
00:08:29,524 --> 00:08:31,354
- I like building.

161
00:08:31,354 --> 00:08:34,376
(bright music)

162
00:08:34,376 --> 00:08:36,376
- [Jeremy] You skippin'?

163
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:42,702
- So I just checked my email

164
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:45,760
and I got an email that
Elise has been waiting for.

165
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,942
What are you waiting to hear about?

166
00:08:47,942 --> 00:08:48,998
Jeremy knows about this.

167
00:08:48,998 --> 00:08:50,983
- No way, this is so exciting.
- Yay Lise.

168
00:08:50,983 --> 00:08:53,594
- [Jeremy] I think she got an email about

169
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:56,011
the upcoming Christmas songs.

170
00:08:57,542 --> 00:08:58,375
- [Kendra] The auditions?

171
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,533
- [Jeremy] The audition.

172
00:08:59,533 --> 00:09:01,708
- [Kendra] Do you remember
when you auditioned?

173
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,095
- I get one?

174
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:05,236
- [Kendra] So I got an
email, I have to open it up

175
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:08,272
to see if you got one or not.

176
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:09,848
- Let's see.
- Okay.

177
00:09:09,848 --> 00:09:11,338
- Remember, I did like six auditions

178
00:09:11,338 --> 00:09:13,256
before I ever made anything,

179
00:09:13,256 --> 00:09:14,499
so even if you don't get it,

180
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:15,879
you are a good singer.

181
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,988
- [Kendra] Lise, do you
want me to open it or wait?

182
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,156
- Open it.

183
00:09:19,156 --> 00:09:20,314
- [Kendra[ Open it.

184
00:09:20,314 --> 00:09:23,222
You are going to be in
the small group medley

185
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:24,897
for I Adore You.

186
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,873
- Yay, that's the one that I wanted.

187
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:29,145
- Is that one your favorite?

188
00:09:29,145 --> 00:09:30,310
- [Jeremy] Yeah, that's the song you sing.

189
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,788
- I'm so excited for you.

190
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,473
So lots of kids in the school audition

191
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,337
and they chose about
three kids for each song.

192
00:09:37,337 --> 00:09:38,950
And so Elise is gonna be in a small group

193
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,413
singing I Adore you.
- Boom.

194
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:43,140
- I'm so proud of you.
- That's the one I wanted.

195
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,143
- [Kendra] Honestly, I
would've been proud of you

196
00:09:44,143 --> 00:09:45,348
if you didn't get it too.

197
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:46,181
- Yeah.

198
00:09:46,181 --> 00:09:47,331
- [Kendra] I'm just
proud of you for trying.

199
00:09:47,331 --> 00:09:48,498
- J House out.

200
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,634
(yelling)

201
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,026
(Jeremy laughing)

202
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:55,609
- [Jeremy] Get him.

203
00:09:56,736 --> 00:09:57,761
- It's snowing.

204
00:09:57,761 --> 00:09:59,480
- Trick or treat.

205
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,208
- Daddy, it's too heavy.

206
00:10:01,208 --> 00:00:00,000
(playful spooky music)
