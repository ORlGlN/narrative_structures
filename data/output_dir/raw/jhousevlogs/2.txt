1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,663
- This one's gonna be perfect!

2
00:00:02,663 --> 00:00:03,746
Wah-ha-ha-ha!

3
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:08,183
(Disco music)

4
00:00:12,114 --> 00:00:13,068
- [Dad] How'd it turn out?

5
00:00:13,068 --> 00:00:14,632
- Really good.

6
00:00:14,632 --> 00:00:17,132
(Disco music)

7
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:23,658
- [Dad] Good morning.

8
00:00:23,658 --> 00:00:25,022
- Good morning.

9
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:26,819
- [Dad] Time for breakfast.

10
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,489
It's time for breakfast,
big girl. Come on.

11
00:00:29,489 --> 00:00:32,239
(Acoustic music)

12
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:35,111
- Whoopsie daisy!

13
00:00:36,065 --> 00:00:38,315
- [Dad] Did you spill some?

14
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:41,841
What are you doing Kalen?

15
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:44,324
- I'm putting this up.

16
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:46,934
- [Dad] Dude, this is awesome!

17
00:00:46,934 --> 00:00:49,456
- There's four rooms
for all the four kids.

18
00:00:49,456 --> 00:00:52,159
- [Dad] You were awake
before anybody else.

19
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,102
- I know.

20
00:00:53,102 --> 00:00:54,252
- [Dad] And you're just building?

21
00:00:54,252 --> 00:00:55,133
- Yep.

22
00:00:55,133 --> 00:00:57,179
- [Dad] Hey buddy, let's
go eat some breakfast.

23
00:00:57,179 --> 00:00:58,012
- Okay.

24
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:01,645
- [Dad] You excited about school today?

25
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,704
- Uh-huh!

26
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:04,196
- [Dad] So why are you all dressed up?

27
00:01:04,196 --> 00:01:07,226
- Because at school it's dress up day

28
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,078
for the kindergarteners.

29
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:10,913
- [Dad] What are you dressing up as?

30
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:11,771
- Thing one.

31
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,498
- [Dad] Is this from Doctor Seuss?

32
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:14,331
- Yep!

33
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,831
(Happy music)

34
00:01:22,059 --> 00:01:25,150
- [Dad] Hey! Did you wake up happy?

35
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,983
She's off!

36
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:31,815
(baby laughs)

37
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,782
- [Dad] Hop in!

38
00:01:34,782 --> 00:01:36,633
- [Mom] Do you you see who it is?

39
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:37,527
- No!

40
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:40,233
- [Mom] I see aunt Ashley!

41
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,066
- Michael!

42
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:43,518
- [Mom] Yeah, we're coming to play

43
00:01:43,518 --> 00:01:45,651
with Michael and Elizabeth today!

44
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:47,197
- Yay!

45
00:01:47,197 --> 00:01:49,380
- So after we dropped off
the big kids at school today,

46
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,538
I'm taking Laura and Janae
to a really fun place

47
00:01:52,538 --> 00:01:54,746
called paradise park. Are you excited?

48
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,509
- (giggles) Michael's here!

49
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,130
- Our cousin-friend, that's the best kind!

50
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:03,125
Here's the funny thing, I didn't
look at what time it opens,

51
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,636
so we're here early, so we
have 15 minutes to just wait.

52
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:06,469
Hi!

53
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:07,891
- [Mom] There's Michael!

54
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:10,787
We're gonna have a dance
party to kill the time.

55
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:12,787
(Music)

56
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:16,631
You seem them out there? Wow!

57
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:17,798
So come on in!

58
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:22,339
(Music and kids screaming)

59
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,428
(Laughing)

60
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:29,443
- [Mom] Good morning Elizabeth!

61
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:32,995
- [Aunt] Oh, yeah! (laughing)

62
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,203
- [Child] Hey Laura!

63
00:02:34,203 --> 00:02:36,953
(Cheerful music)

64
00:02:40,383 --> 00:02:41,563
- [Mom] How's the ball pit?

65
00:02:41,563 --> 00:02:44,230
(Child screams)

66
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:49,075
- [Mom] Are the balls
dropping from the ceiling?

67
00:02:49,075 --> 00:02:51,825
(Cheerful music)

68
00:02:53,547 --> 00:02:54,638
- [Mom] Janea, there's so many new things

69
00:02:54,638 --> 00:02:55,980
to make messes with!

70
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,313
Are you dancing?

71
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:02,046
- Here you go!

72
00:03:02,046 --> 00:03:02,879
- Thanks!

73
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,296
(Jazz music)

74
00:03:12,377 --> 00:03:15,363
- [Mom] Oh, thank you! That's a great one!

75
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:18,895
Let's see what you got.
Did you get me some bread?

76
00:03:18,895 --> 00:03:19,812
Mmm, bread.

77
00:03:22,065 --> 00:03:25,633
(Children talking)

78
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,383
(Tropical Music)

79
00:03:30,317 --> 00:03:33,745
- [Mom] Janea just splashed
herself, she's so confused.

80
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:34,662
You got it!

81
00:03:36,972 --> 00:03:38,389
What is going on?

82
00:03:39,616 --> 00:03:40,560
What is that?

83
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,880
- Turtle!

84
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:45,129
(Motorboat noise)

85
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:48,898
- [Mom] So Janea loves this
and keeps splashing herself.

86
00:03:48,898 --> 00:03:50,231
What's going on?

87
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:54,636
Are you okay?

88
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:56,969
(Splashing)

89
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,662
(Baby laughs)

90
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:07,767
- [Mom] What did you make
for us? You made pizza?

91
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:08,600
- Uh huh.

92
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,396
- [Mom] What did you
make? Can you say a mess?

93
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:11,354
(Plates falling)

94
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,187
Crash!

95
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:14,187
That makes a loud noise.

96
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,070
Did you find a piece?

97
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,070
Are you gonna serves some over here?

98
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,995
Good job Miss Janae! (Laughs)

99
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,502
Laura found the face paint.

100
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:36,002
(Silly music)

101
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:39,629
- Is that okay?

102
00:04:39,629 --> 00:04:40,629
- [Mom] Yup.

103
00:04:41,896 --> 00:04:42,729
Nice!

104
00:04:43,591 --> 00:04:45,492
We had a great time
playing with our cousins.

105
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,615
We came full circle, we
started in the ball pit

106
00:04:47,615 --> 00:04:49,899
and now we are ending in the ball pit.

107
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,349
This is a place I'd come when
the big kids were little.

108
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:53,407
But I haven't brought the little girls,

109
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,202
so it's kind of fun to relive
those moments with them.

110
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:59,287
- [Dad] Alright, everyone.
Grab an egg and dry it off.

111
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:01,411
And get ready to color it.

112
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:03,911
(Funky music)

113
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,639
- [Dad] Sorry Isaac,
this is the only apron

114
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,389
we have for you, bud.

115
00:05:14,894 --> 00:05:17,769
Smell what I put in the bowls.
What does it smell like?

116
00:05:17,769 --> 00:05:18,602
- Vinegar!

117
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:20,633
- [Dad] It's pretty strong huh?

118
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:22,309
- It looks like water.

119
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,892
- [Dad] It does, but
it smells like Easter.

120
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:29,244
- Whoa!

121
00:05:29,244 --> 00:05:33,327
- [Dad] Isn't that fun?
Okay, Laura, go ahead.

122
00:05:33,327 --> 00:05:35,595
- That is mesmerizing.

123
00:05:35,595 --> 00:05:37,595
- [Dad] It is quite fun.

124
00:05:40,267 --> 00:05:41,306
What color is that one?

125
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,139
- Green.

126
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:44,792
- It's blue.

127
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,240
- [Dad] If you want to,
you can use a crayon

128
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,751
and color on your egg
before you start dying it,

129
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,834
it's your choice. Go
ahead, you guys can start.

130
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:53,566
You can do whatever
you want with your egg.

131
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:56,233
(Hip-hop music)

132
00:05:59,745 --> 00:06:03,164
- [Isaac] I actually
want a plain yellow one.

133
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:05,831
(Hip-hop music)

134
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:12,040
- [Dad] Hmm, Laura, I love this one.

135
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,103
- Thanks. I made it for you, daddy.

136
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:15,058
- [Dad] Thank you!

137
00:06:15,058 --> 00:06:18,267
What happens when you mix those two?

138
00:06:18,267 --> 00:06:19,589
That's pretty.

139
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:23,115
- I'm doing red and blue. As a mix.

140
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,454
- I love mine!

141
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,799
- [Dad] Isn't that fun to
be creative and make stuff?

142
00:06:26,799 --> 00:06:27,878
How'd it turn out?

143
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:29,045
- Really good.

144
00:06:30,328 --> 00:06:31,751
- [Dad] You got a football?

145
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:32,584
- Uh huh.

146
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:35,877
- You're doing my orange?

147
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:37,877
- How can Laura do this?

148
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:41,709
- [Dad] Isn't it amazing?

149
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:42,591
- [Isaac] Yes!

150
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,373
- [Dad] It was by doing
it in two different colors

151
00:06:44,373 --> 00:06:45,986
and it just turned out that way.

152
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:49,167
She's an egg designing protege.

153
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:53,097
- I'm gonna do the, mix
yellow and green together.

154
00:06:53,097 --> 00:06:55,195
- [Dad] Oh, cool.

155
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:58,059
Alright, Elise is wanting
to do one more color.

156
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,295
So Kendra picked these out
and I wanted to give it a try.

157
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,326
You're supposed to be
able to paint the eggs.

158
00:07:02,326 --> 00:07:03,484
You guys want to see if it works?

159
00:07:03,484 --> 00:07:04,317
- Yeah.

160
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:05,367
- I'm gonna do one.

161
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,534
- So if I snap this, oops!

162
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,479
I don't know if I was
supposed to snap it that much,

163
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:13,827
but now I can paint with this.

164
00:07:13,827 --> 00:07:16,327
(Funky music)

165
00:07:20,155 --> 00:07:21,163
I have it like this now I'm gonna try

166
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:23,330
to stick it in the orange.

167
00:07:25,783 --> 00:07:27,387
- [Dad] Oh!

168
00:07:27,387 --> 00:07:28,427
Got in my eye.

169
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:29,728
Got it on your face!

170
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:32,087
Got it on the camera!

171
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:34,309
- Laura tried to dry
it off when it was wet

172
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:35,541
and now it looks super cool

173
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,186
and now she wants to paint the top.

174
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:39,697
- [Dad] Alright, let's paint on it.

175
00:07:39,697 --> 00:07:41,018
Here you go.

176
00:07:41,018 --> 00:07:43,851
(Classical music)

177
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,417
- This one's gonna be perfect.

178
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:48,500
Wah-ha-ha-ha!

179
00:07:51,782 --> 00:07:54,365
- Whoa, Elise! Elise's is good.

180
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:59,075
- [Dad] I love the drawing that you did.

181
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,398
That's, like, perfect.

182
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:05,306
