1
00:00:00,286 --> 00:00:03,074
♫ It's time to say hello!

2
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:06,074
(children laughing)

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:09,872
And Laura sits down next to me

4
00:00:09,872 --> 00:00:12,428
and picks up a giant booger.

5
00:00:12,428 --> 00:00:14,464
(baby squeals)
Yeah!

6
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:16,207
That's my desire, just to raise kids

7
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:18,704
that know their mother loves them.

8
00:00:18,704 --> 00:00:22,371
(bright synth-driven music)

9
00:00:26,105 --> 00:00:26,938
- [Man] Enjoy!

10
00:00:26,938 --> 00:00:28,492
- I didn't have a dream today.

11
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:29,736
- [Man] You didn't have any dreams?

12
00:00:29,736 --> 00:00:30,839
- Yeah, today.

13
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:32,033
- [Man] Did you have a dream, buddy?

14
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:32,910
- Yeah.

15
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,473
- [Man] What happened to your lip?

16
00:00:35,473 --> 00:00:36,692
- I was bleeding.

17
00:00:36,692 --> 00:00:38,358
- [Man] Yeah, yesterday
you bonked it, huh?

18
00:00:38,358 --> 00:00:39,652
- Yeah.

19
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:41,069
- [Man] It hurts.

20
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:52,003
- We're headed out this morning,

21
00:00:52,003 --> 00:00:53,654
I'm dropping the big kids off at school,

22
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,320
and then I'm coming back and I'm going

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,706
to host preschool with Laura's friends.

24
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:58,011
My question for the day,

25
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:59,631
is how do you get to school,

26
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:01,037
or how do you get your kids to school?

27
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:03,018
Do they ride the bus, do they walk,

28
00:01:03,018 --> 00:01:05,154
do they bike, do they use
public transportation?

29
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:06,414
Or do you drive them?

30
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:07,439
We drive our kids.

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,136
They're going crazy in
the car, I've got to go.

32
00:01:09,136 --> 00:01:12,410
- Today at school I'm
practicing my singing part

33
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,256
and I'm really excited.

34
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:15,829
- [Woman] Is it going to be
your first time practicing it?

35
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,556
- Yup, my first time, but
I've been practicing at home.

36
00:01:19,556 --> 00:01:23,389
- What I'm excited about
for school is recess.

37
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:26,902
- I am excited for lunch.

38
00:01:26,902 --> 00:01:30,951
Another thing I'm excited
about is I really like P.E.

39
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:34,159
and I'm doing some fun things in art.

40
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:35,723
- [Woman] All right guys,
have a good day at school!

41
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,412
- [Kids] Bye.
- [Woman] Bye!

42
00:01:37,412 --> 00:01:39,299
I thought the kids were
going to be late to school,

43
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,056
but they have to be here
by 9 a.m. and we made it.

44
00:01:41,056 --> 00:01:42,370
But the kids and I did have

45
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,341
an interesting conversation
about speeding.

46
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:46,398
It got me thinking, like, I think I need

47
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,648
to try harder not to speed.

48
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,978
So I'm hosting Laura's preschool
little play group today

49
00:01:53,978 --> 00:01:56,033
and we're starting with some music time.

50
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:58,975
♫ Hands clap, feet tap,

51
00:01:58,975 --> 00:02:02,654
♫ it's time to say hello.

52
00:02:02,654 --> 00:02:05,771
♫ Let's all come together, come together!

53
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,366
♫ And raise our voices high.

54
00:02:08,366 --> 00:02:10,269
♫ La, la, la, la, la.

55
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,103
♫ La-La-La-La-La.

56
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,657
(children's music)

57
00:02:33,915 --> 00:02:35,248
Go.. so... slow.

58
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:39,546
Motorboat, motorboat, go so fast!

59
00:02:39,546 --> 00:02:42,674
Motorboat, motorboat, run out of gas!

60
00:02:42,674 --> 00:02:43,841
[Child] Again!

61
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:54,241
- Put the oil in the pot
and you make it real hot,

62
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:58,408
sizzle, sizzle, sizzle,
sizzle, sizzle, sizzle, pop!

63
00:02:59,294 --> 00:03:00,507
It's snack time and we're making popcorn,

64
00:03:00,507 --> 00:03:03,174
because that's Laura's favorite.

65
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:07,202
(children laughing)

66
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,814
- [Man] They're pretty
excited about this snack.

67
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:16,147
- Yeah, apparently popcorn is a big hit.

68
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,063
Who wants some popcorn?

69
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:21,230
[Children] Me!

70
00:03:22,191 --> 00:03:25,191
(sweet piano music)

71
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:29,311
- Whenever I'm hanging
out with preschoolers,

72
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:31,911
I always try to time
snack time and story time,

73
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:33,622
at the same time because
then they're quiet

74
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:34,668
and they listen really well.

75
00:03:34,668 --> 00:03:35,894
Someone is driving up,

76
00:03:35,894 --> 00:03:37,885
snip-snap go the blinds,

77
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,278
is Mama coming now?

78
00:03:39,278 --> 00:03:42,881
Nope, it isn't Mama, it's only Mrs. Cow.

79
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:45,041
Here's the books we're
reading for story time today.

80
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,683
You guys ready to hear Corduroy?

81
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:48,315
Corduroy is a bear who once lived

82
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,217
in the toy department of a big store.

83
00:03:51,217 --> 00:03:53,512
The store was always filled with shoppers

84
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:55,020
buying all sorts of things.

85
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,482
Now it's just free play time.

86
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:58,191
We've got some play
dough out for some kids,

87
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:59,571
and other kids are just playing with toys.

88
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:01,326
It's almost quiet and peaceful.

89
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:02,922
They're swimming to school?

90
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:04,422
This is beautiful.

91
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:08,483
- [Child] There's one for everyone.

92
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:10,291
- [Woman] This is fun.

93
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,551
So the preschool crowd just left

94
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:12,799
and we had a really good time with them,

95
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,352
but its always a good
reminder when I'm around

96
00:04:14,352 --> 00:04:16,659
a bunch of three-year-olds,
what three-year-olds are like.

97
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:18,076
Because sometimes with Laura I'm like,

98
00:04:18,076 --> 00:04:20,147
come on, just share, come on, do this.

99
00:04:20,147 --> 00:04:21,878
It reminds me to be patient with her,

100
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:23,448
because her behavior
is just totally normal

101
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:24,474
for a three-year-old.

102
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,262
Right after they left, I came
and sat down on the couch

103
00:04:26,262 --> 00:04:30,470
and Laura sits down next to me
and picks up a giant booger.

104
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,044
Like, this giant booger wad.

105
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:34,510
And she's like, "What is this?"

106
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,578
I was like, that's a booger
that somebody left on the couch.

107
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,572
She said, "Hmm," then she reaches down

108
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,641
to put it down on the couch,

109
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:41,530
I'm like, no!

110
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,184
Get a kleenex, throw it in
the trash, wash your hands.

111
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,254
Yeah, I think that's one of the things

112
00:04:46,254 --> 00:04:47,400
that we learn as we get older,

113
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,727
is not to leave giant booger
wads on our friend's couches.

114
00:04:50,727 --> 00:04:53,361
So, a little fun, friendly
reminder for the day.

115
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,779
- So Britt and I were
just having a meeting

116
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,049
about our law practice
and now I'm going to head

117
00:04:57,049 --> 00:04:58,446
and pick up the kids from school.

118
00:04:58,446 --> 00:05:01,529
(heavy guitar music)

119
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:05,443
So I'm here a little bit late,

120
00:05:05,443 --> 00:05:07,898
so I'm at the very end of the line of cars

121
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:09,011
to go pick up the kids.

122
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:11,002
It looks like I wasn't
the last person in line,

123
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:14,434
there's still a line
of cars back behind me.

124
00:05:14,434 --> 00:05:16,391
So, I don't feel quite as bad.

125
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:18,090
You sang today? How was school?

126
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,923
- Good.

127
00:05:22,888 --> 00:05:25,394
(soft acoustic music)

128
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:27,811
- She's wearing her swimsuit.

129
00:05:33,594 --> 00:05:36,824
Are you wearing your swim suit?

130
00:05:36,824 --> 00:05:38,826
So Laura has told me
before that the best way

131
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,357
to wake up is snuggling.

132
00:05:41,357 --> 00:05:42,809
Is that true?

133
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,226
Are we snuggling?

134
00:05:45,665 --> 00:05:47,511
The big kids are going to
be home from school soon,

135
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:50,164
and then the day is going to get exciting.

136
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:53,351
Why is it going to get exciting?

137
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,116
Who's coming over?

138
00:05:55,116 --> 00:05:59,283
- Allison and Brandi and they're
bringing their swimsuits!

139
00:06:00,254 --> 00:06:02,616
- So I have a friend who
just recently had a surgery,

140
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:06,216
and so we are having
her four kids over today

141
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:08,261
to hang out and play so
she can hopefully rest

142
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:10,314
and keep recovering.

143
00:06:10,314 --> 00:06:13,481
(soft acoustic music)

144
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:19,145
You did it, you snapped!

145
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,881
- [Man] So how did it
go singing your part?

146
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,396
- Oh it was good!

147
00:06:25,396 --> 00:06:27,242
One person was gone from our group,

148
00:06:27,242 --> 00:06:30,540
so we just sang with two people.

149
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,968
- [Man] And you guys got
your school pictures back?

150
00:06:31,968 --> 00:06:32,836
- [Children] Yep.

151
00:06:32,836 --> 00:06:37,003
♫ Tell me honestly, would
you still love me the same?

152
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,228
What happened up here?

153
00:06:43,228 --> 00:06:44,498
- [Child] I found them!

154
00:06:44,498 --> 00:06:47,748
- [Man] Did you hide? Did you jump out?

155
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:52,104
- [Woman] It was pretty good.

156
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:53,283
Do you want to show him? Grab it?

157
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:54,298
Let's show him how we were hiding.

158
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,298
- [Man] Let's get Isaac.

159
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,041
(laughter)

160
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,748
He got you guys!

161
00:07:04,748 --> 00:07:05,964
So how'd the school pictures turn out?

162
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:07,012
- [Children] Good.

163
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:08,439
- [Man] If you had to
pick a favorite of yours,

164
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:09,450
which one would you pick?

165
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,721
- [Child] I like that one.

166
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,051
- [Man] That one has a lot of personality.

167
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,236
Isaac likes D, Louise likes B and C.

168
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:18,653
- [Woman] So I bought this banner thingy,

169
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:21,298
Jeremy says it's called a decoration.

170
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:24,798
I got it from Target and
I'm trying to decide if

171
00:07:24,798 --> 00:07:25,777
I like it or not.

172
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,745
I'm wondering if since
I don't decorate at all,

173
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:30,335
if having a decoration is
actually kind of awkward.

174
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:31,942
Jeremy is voting against it.

175
00:07:31,942 --> 00:07:34,653
- I feel-- It reminds me
a little bit of something

176
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:38,216
my grandma would do, no offense Grandma.

177
00:07:38,216 --> 00:07:40,449
I'm just going to stop right there.

178
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:41,443
- [Woman] That's okay.

179
00:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,211
- I would keep it up
just so that you remember

180
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:45,268
to be thankful, especially
with Thanksgiving coming up.

181
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:47,080
- [Woman] It's not like
a permanent decoration,

182
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,106
it's like a Thanksgiving decoration.

183
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,423
Since Jeremy and I can't decide about this

184
00:07:50,423 --> 00:07:53,448
decoration thingamabob, we're
going to leave it to a poll.

185
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:56,362
yes we should keep it, or no we shouldn't.

186
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:57,195
Let us know.

187
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,018
- I think it's actually
really good because

188
00:07:59,018 --> 00:08:02,530
hey, you have a decoration
for your favorite holiday.

189
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,679
- I really, really love being
a mother to my children.

190
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,600
Sometimes my kids drive me crazy,

191
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,549
but most of the time I just feel like

192
00:08:09,549 --> 00:08:12,540
this stage of motherhood is
just going by too quickly,

193
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,297
like it's slipping away from me.

194
00:08:14,297 --> 00:08:15,251
Whenever I feel that way,

195
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:18,268
I am tempted to kind of wallow in that

196
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:19,697
and get a little bit sad.

197
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,642
Instead, what I'm trying to do today

198
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:23,442
to respond to that tug on my heart,

199
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:25,938
is to spend the time doing the things

200
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:27,167
that my heart yearns for.

201
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,856
I don't care today if
my house isn't picked up

202
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,859
or what kind of an amazing dinner I cook.

203
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:34,006
Maybe we'll just buy something for dinner.

204
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:36,616
But I do care that I get
to hold this little one.

205
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:39,294
I do care that I have
time to read with Laura

206
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:42,307
and snuggle her and snuggle the big kids

207
00:08:42,308 --> 00:08:43,231
when they get home from school

208
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,584
and talk to them about their day

209
00:08:44,584 --> 00:08:47,103
and play with them and
answer their questions.

210
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,228
Just be with them, these little people,

211
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,445
they're so amazing.

212
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:53,010
I just love them.

213
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,946
Look how precious she is.

214
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:57,215
I feel like I could just sit
here all day staring at her.

215
00:08:57,215 --> 00:08:59,048
I love being a mother.

216
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:05,545
It's the greatest gift and
privilege and challenge.

217
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,540
I know that I'm making mistakes
with motherhood everyday.

218
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,923
It's hard.

219
00:09:12,923 --> 00:09:15,661
But I truly love my kids

220
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:18,748
and I hope that sinks through

221
00:09:18,748 --> 00:09:22,378
passed all my mistakes
and that they feel that.

222
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:24,686
That's my desire, just to raise kids

223
00:09:24,686 --> 00:09:27,443
that know their mother loves them.

224
00:09:27,443 --> 00:09:28,746
Okay well now I'm kind of stressed

225
00:09:28,746 --> 00:09:30,447
because while I was
having a wonderful time

226
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:31,564
snuggling and reading and playing

227
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:32,742
with my girls this afternoon,

228
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:34,443
I wasn't getting done the stuff

229
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:35,685
that I maybe should have been doing,

230
00:09:35,685 --> 00:09:37,018
like cleaning up the kitchen,

231
00:09:37,018 --> 00:09:38,521
doing some dishes, getting dinner out

232
00:09:38,521 --> 00:09:41,135
and de thawing soon enough
so I can make dinner

233
00:09:41,135 --> 00:09:42,644
for our friends that are
coming over this evening.

234
00:09:42,644 --> 00:09:44,502
It's just hard, like it's
a hard balance in life.

235
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,979
I want to be able to enjoy my kids,

236
00:09:46,979 --> 00:09:48,879
but you also got to get stuff done.

237
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,712
(baby squeals)

238
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:52,045
Yeah, that's how I feel too.

239
00:09:55,555 --> 00:09:57,036
So we currently have nine kids over here

240
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:57,869
and I'm making dinner.

241
00:09:57,869 --> 00:09:59,093
I'm making my red and white pasta

242
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,321
because it's a crowd pleaser.

243
00:10:00,321 --> 00:10:02,042
Kids just like pasta.

244
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:03,375
Veggies for all.

245
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:07,196
- [Child] I think they should
get a chain saw and just go--

246
00:10:07,196 --> 00:10:09,446
- So late this afternoon I
was feeling kind of grumpy

247
00:10:09,446 --> 00:10:11,255
and it was just before I was going

248
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:12,460
to pick up my friend's
kids, and this is my friend

249
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:14,260
that just had surgery and
so we were watching her kids

250
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,375
and feeding them dinner tonight,

251
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,726
and I was just feeling anxiety,

252
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:20,908
welling up in my body
and I picked up her kids,

253
00:10:20,908 --> 00:10:24,333
and almost immediately I
started feeling better.

254
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,731
Just seeing what she was going through

255
00:10:25,731 --> 00:10:27,224
and having the chance to love her kids,

256
00:10:27,224 --> 00:10:29,958
it just really lifted my spirits.

257
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:32,087
And then when I was watching them,

258
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,718
I ended up texting her and I said,

259
00:10:33,718 --> 00:10:35,235
can I do some laundry for you tonight?

260
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:37,690
It's funny because I
know it was really hard

261
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,904
for her to accept that help,

262
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,098
but it's actually helping me.

263
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,044
Sometimes my anxiety,

264
00:10:42,044 --> 00:10:43,606
I don't always know why it comes or goes.

265
00:10:43,606 --> 00:10:46,015
But consistently when I'm able

266
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:48,974
to push passed that anxiety and try

267
00:10:48,974 --> 00:10:50,796
to love or serve other people,

268
00:10:50,796 --> 00:10:52,462
it always helps the anxiety.

269
00:10:52,462 --> 00:10:54,206
At least for a little bit.

270
00:10:54,206 --> 00:10:56,433
And so those are my thoughts for tonight.

271
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,938
I'm happy to be doing laundry.

272
00:10:58,938 --> 00:10:59,938
J house out.

273
00:11:01,574 --> 00:11:04,568
- I think I have a heart attack.

274
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:06,165
(children squealing)

275
00:11:06,165 --> 00:00:00,000
(joyful wacky music)
