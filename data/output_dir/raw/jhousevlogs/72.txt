1
00:00:00,758 --> 00:00:01,994
- Because Christmas is over.

2
00:00:01,994 --> 00:00:05,077
- No.
- Oy! (laughs)

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,888
She's doing it.

4
00:00:08,888 --> 00:00:11,208
She wants to come out
and play in the snow.

5
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:13,708
(funky music)

6
00:00:19,676 --> 00:00:22,060
- Today we are playing
with Christmas toys,

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,574
trying to clean up the house,

8
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:26,128
and the kids are working on
writing their thank you cards.

9
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:28,001
- I drawed a snowman.

10
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:29,495
- You made a snowman,
- Yeah.

11
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:31,042
- That's a pretty cool looking snowman.

12
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:33,990
Who's your note for?
- For Papa.

13
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,244
- Ooh, what're you gonna write?

14
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,197
- (mumbles)

15
00:00:37,197 --> 00:00:38,742
- You're gonna spell your name on it?

16
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,888
- (mumbles)

17
00:00:40,888 --> 00:00:42,309
- Caleb who's your card to?

18
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,061
- Granny Jo and Papa Keith.

19
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:46,771
- Nice, can you read me the inside?

20
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:50,063
- Thank you for the
cologne, it is so strong.

21
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:54,230
And again thank you from Caleb,
to Granny Jo and Papa Keith.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,385
- Nice.
- Thank you.

23
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:58,865
- Who are you writing a card to Isaac?

24
00:00:58,865 --> 00:01:00,409
- Granny Jo and Papa Keith.

25
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:04,659
- Here's some of the ones
they've already made.

26
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:08,659
Look at that focus, she's
concentrating so hard.

27
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:12,268
Laura, Laura, Laura.

28
00:01:13,404 --> 00:01:15,209
- I'm gonna do more Lauras.

29
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,391
- You're gonna do more Lauras?

30
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:17,847
What's your favorite color?

31
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:21,668
- Pink.
- Oh she's wearing pink pants.

32
00:01:21,668 --> 00:01:24,598
A pink shirt, and coloring
with a pink marker

33
00:01:24,598 --> 00:01:26,186
with pink nail polish on.

34
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:28,832
- Pink, so what's your
favorite color again?

35
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,192
- What's your favorite color again?

36
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,025
(Christmas music)

37
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:49,365
- You getting ready Laura?

38
00:01:49,365 --> 00:01:50,790
- Okay, one more glove.

39
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,957
(mumbling)
(leaf blower rumbling)

40
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:02,004
(Christmas music)

41
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,816
- Oy! (laughs)

42
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,150
You guys wanna try sledding?

43
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,983
- Yeah.

44
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,669
- Perfect, one, two, three.

45
00:02:22,839 --> 00:02:24,725
Whoo, look.
- I made one.

46
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,166
- You did a perfect snow angel.

47
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:28,499
One, two, three, look at it.

48
00:02:29,642 --> 00:02:32,809
She's doing it, you made a snow angel.

49
00:02:34,645 --> 00:02:36,642
- Yay!
- It's snowing.

50
00:02:36,642 --> 00:02:39,282
- I think it might just be
blowing through the trees.

51
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:42,239
This is such a cool Christmas gift.

52
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,574
Nay Nay, she wants to come
out and play in the snow.

53
00:02:45,574 --> 00:02:46,667
You wanna go sledding?

54
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,066
- Yep.
- Yep.

55
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:49,236
- Can I eat snow?

56
00:02:49,236 --> 00:02:51,653
- Of course you can eat snow.

57
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,158
What you doing?
- Eating the ice.

58
00:02:55,158 --> 00:02:57,825
(playful music)

59
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:01,318
- Hey, ah!

60
00:03:02,454 --> 00:03:04,621
(yelling)

61
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,062
- I made a good snowball.

62
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,324
- You can't see.

63
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:13,493
(laughter)

64
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,402
(yelling)
(grunts)

65
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:18,652
(laughing)

66
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:27,802
Whoa!

67
00:03:28,784 --> 00:03:31,451
(playful music)

68
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:37,775
Was that fun?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:37,775 --> 00:03:40,608
(Christmas music)

70
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,813
She's holding on.

71
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:48,646
(Christmas music)

72
00:03:52,505 --> 00:03:54,729
So I like using the snow blower
but the kids wanna shovel.

73
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:57,646
(shovels scraping)

74
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:06,221
Good job buddy.

75
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:09,138
(shovels scraping)

76
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,545
So we cleared our driveway,
but we have some neighbors who

77
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:16,821
are older and not in good health

78
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:18,533
and we decided to clear their driveway

79
00:04:18,533 --> 00:04:20,565
and I was really proud of the boys.

80
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:22,582
They wanted to come and help.

81
00:04:22,582 --> 00:04:24,273
- They got us our present.

82
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:25,805
- That's not why we serve though right?

83
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:26,940
- Yeah.

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,581
- Well our neighbors were
really sweet when they saw

85
00:04:29,581 --> 00:04:31,362
the boys out doing the driveway.

86
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,143
They brought out a
little like gift basket.

87
00:04:33,143 --> 00:04:36,060
A little present for them.

88
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,839
You wanna jump on the tramp?

89
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,422
In the snow?
- Mhm.

90
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,125
(Christmas music)

91
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:50,973
- Ah!
(Christmas music)

92
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,363
So normally after we play in the snow

93
00:05:02,363 --> 00:05:04,016
Kendra makes us hot chocolate.

94
00:05:04,016 --> 00:05:06,485
But Isaac had a new suggestion this year.

95
00:05:06,485 --> 00:05:07,487
- Hot vanilla.

96
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,003
- Did you read it in like a magazine?

97
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,627
- Yeah.
- It is so good.

98
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:11,995
So what are the ingredients?

99
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:14,852
- Four cups of milk, and
one fourth cup of sugar.

100
00:05:14,852 --> 00:05:17,013
Put it on the stove.
- Vanilla?

101
00:05:17,013 --> 00:05:19,029
- A tablespoon of vanilla extract.

102
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,462
- Just a tablespoon, tablespoon?

103
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:23,475
It tastes like drinking
hot vanilla ice cream.

104
00:05:23,475 --> 00:05:25,294
And it's really good, I like it.

105
00:05:25,294 --> 00:05:26,482
It's creamy and delightful.

106
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:27,485
- But it's not hard.

107
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:31,652
(screaming)
(funky music)

108
00:05:38,863 --> 00:05:40,512
- You skating Laura?

109
00:05:40,512 --> 00:05:44,679
(funky music)
(yelling)

110
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,478
- So some years I'm really
sad to take down the

111
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,409
Christmas tree and I kind of
prolong it as long as possible.

112
00:05:53,409 --> 00:05:55,279
Like it's after New Years,
it's a little bit after

113
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:57,746
New Years and I'm like no,
I just want the tree up.

114
00:05:57,746 --> 00:06:01,330
And I love the Christmas
tree, but this year I'm ready.

115
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,683
I'm ready to go ahead and
take the ornaments off

116
00:06:03,683 --> 00:06:06,546
and clean my room and clean my house

117
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,131
and kind of get everything
put back together.

118
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:11,121
I don't know, I guess
while I loved Christmas,

119
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,451
I'm looking more forward
to 2018 and a fresh start.

120
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:17,034
(gentle music)

121
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:24,542
Alright, well I got
all the ornaments down,

122
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,776
we're gonna pack them away.

123
00:06:26,776 --> 00:06:29,117
I'll tackle the lights
and the star tomorrow.

124
00:06:29,117 --> 00:06:32,392
- Well hello, you playing ball?

125
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,225
(baby talk)
Hello.

126
00:06:36,548 --> 00:06:38,631
(grunts)

127
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:43,889
You are getting to be
such a big girl, I know.

128
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:44,888
So how about you guys?

129
00:06:44,888 --> 00:06:47,419
When do you pack up and put
away your Christmas tree?

130
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,721
Is it before New Years, after New Years?

131
00:06:49,721 --> 00:06:52,313
Usually for us it's right after New Years.

132
00:06:52,313 --> 00:06:54,941
But I just got the itch a
little bit early this year

133
00:06:54,941 --> 00:06:56,831
so I'm going ahead and getting it done.

134
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:59,455
- Why are you guys taking
down the decorations?

135
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:01,903
- Because we're gonna
pack up the Christmas tree

136
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:03,649
'cause Christmas is over.
- No.

137
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,443
- Well, we gotta put all the
lights and the ornaments away.

138
00:07:06,443 --> 00:07:07,693
- No.
- Why not?

139
00:07:08,944 --> 00:07:11,966
- Because those are for Christmas.

140
00:07:11,966 --> 00:07:13,745
- You know what, after
Christmas gets packed up

141
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,615
then we get closer to your birthday.

142
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,302
- Oh.
- So you can be four.

143
00:07:18,302 --> 00:07:20,802
(funky music)

144
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:31,114
- So Isaac and I are finally
coming to see the movie Wonder.

145
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:33,879
So Isaac how you feeling
about going to the movies?

146
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:37,351
- I'm excited, it's my first
time going to a theater.

147
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:40,986
I've went out and like watched
a movie on a big screen

148
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:45,253
when I was like four or five
but I haven't actually been.

149
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:46,785
- We just don't go to
movies that much so this is

150
00:07:46,785 --> 00:07:47,991
a fun experience.

151
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,431
And it's cool that we both read the book.

152
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:51,149
- [Woman] Laughter.

153
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:54,057
(clock ticking)
(gentle music)

154
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,225
- So what did you think of the movie?

155
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,513
- I loved it.

156
00:07:56,513 --> 00:07:58,896
- It's such an inspiring story,

157
00:07:58,896 --> 00:08:00,749
such a good message to be kind.

158
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:02,689
Well we hope you all
have a wonderful night.

159
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:03,710
J House out.

160
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:05,836
Is it a hint 'cause of my bad breath?

161
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:08,726
- Yeah.
(laughter)

162
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,279
- Whoa.
- Whoa, different wrap.

163
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,224
(laughter)

164
00:08:13,224 --> 00:08:15,366
She wants.
(laughter)

165
00:08:15,366 --> 00:08:17,327
Yes, this is too embarrassing.
(laughter)

166
00:08:17,327 --> 00:00:00,000
(funky music)
