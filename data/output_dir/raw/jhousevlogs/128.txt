1
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:01,565
- [Kendra] Who's here?

2
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:02,586
- Daddy!

3
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:04,119
(screaming and laughter)

4
00:00:04,119 --> 00:00:05,396
- [Kendra] You watching your big brothers

5
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:07,439
goofing off on the other
side of that window?

6
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:08,809
Why do you think we're making a skeleton?

7
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:10,528
- Because it's almost Halloween.

8
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:13,111
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:20,768 --> 00:00:22,045
Leese, what are we making today?

10
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:23,322
- A skeleton.

11
00:00:23,322 --> 00:00:25,017
- [Kendra] Oh, why do you
think we making a skeleton?

12
00:00:25,017 --> 00:00:27,083
- Because it's almost Halloween.

13
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,616
- Time out, you guys
we finished the details

14
00:00:28,616 --> 00:00:31,588
for our upcoming one million subscribers

15
00:00:31,588 --> 00:00:33,399
service celebration and
we want you to come.

16
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,698
Come eat cake with us, dance with us,

17
00:00:35,698 --> 00:00:37,649
serve with us, be in the vlog

18
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,529
and have a big party.

19
00:00:39,529 --> 00:00:40,899
Bring your family and friends.

20
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:42,780
All of the details are
over on our Facebook page.

21
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,590
It's gonna be November
4th from two to four pm

22
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,633
at our church here in Kansas City.

23
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,259
We would love if you would RSVP.

24
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:52,068
If you're not local, we're gonna have ways

25
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:53,694
for you to participate as well.

26
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,737
So stay tuned, we're gonna
give more details about that.

27
00:00:55,737 --> 00:00:58,129
We're partnering up with
Heart to Heart International

28
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,311
to make hygiene kits for people who have

29
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:02,819
been devastated in Puerto
Rico, like what's happening

30
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:04,955
in Texas and Florida and
California with the wildfires

31
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:07,091
so that people can be taken care of.

32
00:01:07,091 --> 00:01:09,739
We can't wait for this coming up

33
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,875
and we'll have more
details about that party

34
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:15,195
as it gets closer, so stay tuned.

35
00:01:15,195 --> 00:01:16,403
Time in.

36
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:18,609
- [Kendra] We're going to
color it and then assemble it.

37
00:01:18,609 --> 00:01:20,327
- There needs arms.

38
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:22,974
- [Kendra] It needs arms?

39
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:25,017
I think the legs might
be a little bit long.

40
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,457
Caleb's working on the face.

41
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:27,757
Isaac, which part are you doing?

42
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:28,941
- The ribs.

43
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:30,311
- [Kendra] Hey Laura,
what are you working on?

44
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:32,517
Hey the leg bone has a face.

45
00:01:32,517 --> 00:01:33,887
Is it a girl skeleton?

46
00:01:33,887 --> 00:01:35,257
- [Elise] Yeah.

47
00:01:35,257 --> 00:01:39,228
We decided because there's
a lot of boy skeletons.

48
00:01:39,228 --> 00:01:40,969
We wanted it to be different.

49
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,850
- So a friend of mine actually
made this project for us.

50
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,940
So all the parts are
cut out of paper plates

51
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,612
and then you tie it together with yarn.

52
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,678
- I learned in art
class that it's smoother

53
00:01:48,678 --> 00:01:50,699
when you color in circles.

54
00:01:50,699 --> 00:01:52,672
- [Kendra] Show us what you mean.

55
00:01:52,672 --> 00:01:56,852
- This is in circles
and that's in zig zags.

56
00:01:56,852 --> 00:01:59,151
- [Kendra] Got it, so it's
smoother to color in circles.

57
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:01,124
Somebody's making fussy sounds today.

58
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:02,874
What's up girlfriend?

59
00:02:04,398 --> 00:02:05,629
- I made toenails.

60
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,765
- Jenae has had a fussy last little bit.

61
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,298
I'm hoping she's tired but she hasn't

62
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:11,086
been awake from her nap for long.

63
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:13,570
I've tried feeding her,
all the normal stuff.

64
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,237
- She's missing Dad.

65
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:18,400
- [Kendra] Maybe she's missing Dad.

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,049
Luckily he'll be home soon.

67
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:21,488
He's gonna be able to see this.

68
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:23,044
You guys think you can finish
this before Dad gets home.

69
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:25,436
- Yeah.
- Yeah, everyone draw quick.

70
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,479
- So we're here at the airport
just finished _ Summit.

71
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,778
It's like five in the morning

72
00:02:29,778 --> 00:02:32,169
and luckily Brent and my brother,

73
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,362
we're also here with Johnny from the _,

74
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,498
Davy from Eighth Row and _.

75
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:38,915
(rock music)

76
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:51,081
- [Kendra] We're starting
to assemble the skeleton.

77
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:53,664
(guitar music)

78
00:02:57,234 --> 00:02:58,325
You guys almost done?

79
00:02:58,325 --> 00:02:59,370
- Yep.

80
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,972
- It actually looks like a skeleton

81
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,108
and it's about as big as me.

82
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,989
- [Kendra] It is, it's
about as big as you.

83
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:08,240
Oh my goodness, you guys
that skeleton looks awesome.

84
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,490
- It looks pretty actually.

85
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,859
- [Kendra] I really like it.

86
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,067
Who's coming home today?

87
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:16,065
- Dad.

88
00:03:16,065 --> 00:03:19,757
- [Kendra] We're getting our
chores done, hanging out.

89
00:03:19,757 --> 00:03:20,590
Hi.

90
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:23,774
Good morning.

91
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:25,562
Caleb, what's for breakfast?

92
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:28,209
- Breakfast cake with yogurt.

93
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:29,997
- [Kendra] I substituted some of the sugar

94
00:03:29,997 --> 00:03:31,530
for some vanilla yogurt.

95
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,807
Hopefully it tastes good.

96
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,850
Oh my goodness, look at this girl.

97
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,127
You watching your big brothers

98
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:38,960
goofing off on the other
side of that window?

99
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,543
Say hi big brother.

100
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,999
Alright, today's the day.

101
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,949
Jeremy is coming home.

102
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:48,532
(techno music)

103
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,157
- While I was on the plane,
I was sitting next to Mickey.

104
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:04,223
We had a three hour flight

105
00:04:04,223 --> 00:04:06,174
and I think I spent most of the time

106
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:09,425
being completely inspired by her.

107
00:04:09,425 --> 00:04:11,213
She was sharing with me
experiences in her life where

108
00:04:11,213 --> 00:04:15,160
God inspired her and
where miracles happened.

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,805
I'm super inspired, I was really touched.

110
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:20,430
- Thank you, it's a
pleasure meeting you too

111
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,055
and I'm inspired by what you do.

112
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:23,124
You stay encouraged.

113
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:24,169
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

114
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:25,655
- So it's just exciting how
you can meet total strangers,

115
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:27,513
know nothing about them and
they can change your life

116
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,301
forever for good.

117
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:30,323
Thank you for that Mickey.

118
00:04:30,323 --> 00:04:31,344
- Mine too.

119
00:04:31,344 --> 00:04:33,927
(techno music)

120
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:38,171
- When the baby's fussy, but
life still has to get done.

121
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:40,656
I usually just use this
carrier as a front carry,

122
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,536
but it's able to be used
as a back carry too.

123
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,231
I'm getting lunch ready right now

124
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,112
and I can't have Jenae
grabbing at all the food

125
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:47,552
and it's gonna be warmed up.

126
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:49,177
And I don't want her
to be by anything hot,

127
00:04:49,177 --> 00:04:51,824
so we're doing the back right now.

128
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,450
Hi Sweet Pea.

129
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,075
Leftovers for lunch today.

130
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,118
They are chicken ranch enchiladas.

131
00:04:57,118 --> 00:04:58,512
We tried them for the
first time last night

132
00:04:58,512 --> 00:04:59,510
and they're pretty good.

133
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,553
- We need to name our skeleton.

134
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:03,016
- [Kendra] We need to name our skeleton?

135
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:04,038
- Yeah.

136
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,174
- [Kendra] What do you
think we should name it?

137
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,869
What do you think we should name it?

138
00:05:07,869 --> 00:05:10,841
- The Creepiest Skeleton in the World.

139
00:05:10,841 --> 00:05:12,142
- Girlnae.

140
00:05:12,142 --> 00:05:14,023
- [Kendra] Girlnae?
- Yeah.

141
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,044
- Girlnae.

142
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:18,527
- Instead of Jenae-nae,
we could do Skanae-nae.

143
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,527
Like a skeleton nae-nae.

144
00:05:21,616 --> 00:05:22,893
- Scarenae-nae.

145
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:24,170
- Scarenae-nae.

146
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,354
My vote is Molly.

147
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:27,328
- Sounds like Mommy.

148
00:05:27,328 --> 00:05:29,719
- [Kendra] Oh no, let's
not do that one then.

149
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:31,089
- Girl Party.

150
00:05:31,089 --> 00:05:32,111
- [Kendra] Girl Party?

151
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,551
How about Mrs. Bones?

152
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:34,384
- Yeah.

153
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:36,500
Mrs. Bones.

154
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,823
- Alright, clearly
we're having a hard time

155
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:39,356
coming up with a name for the skeleton.

156
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,654
Please leave us your suggestions
in the comments below

157
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,883
and we will use one of those
for the skeleton's name.

158
00:05:43,883 --> 00:05:46,043
- The other name was Pumpkin.

159
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:48,922
- [Kendra] Pumpkin, that's
a fun name for a skeleton.

160
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,292
- Yep.

161
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,336
- [Kendra] You hanging her up?

162
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:54,216
Have we decided on a name?

163
00:05:54,216 --> 00:05:55,563
- Nope, not yet.

164
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,374
- [Kendra] Maybe we'll let Dad choose..

165
00:05:57,374 --> 00:05:59,418
- Yep-a-dee-dep.

166
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:00,602
- [Kendra] Looks great.

167
00:06:00,602 --> 00:06:02,227
- I'm the so glad when Dad comes home.

168
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,015
As glad as I can be.

169
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,011
I clap my hands and shout for joy

170
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:09,094
and climb up on his knee.

171
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,283
- [Kendra] Who's here?

172
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,116
- Daddy!

173
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:17,065
(screams and laughter)

174
00:06:17,065 --> 00:06:18,179
- [Kendra] Oh guys, the door's locked.

175
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,679
Somebody has to go let him in.

176
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,636
There it is.

177
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:26,724
(screams and cheers)

178
00:06:26,724 --> 00:06:28,057
- Get over here.

179
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,207
I missed you guys.

180
00:06:30,207 --> 00:06:32,124
- I missed you too Dad.

181
00:06:33,365 --> 00:06:35,115
- So good to see you.

182
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:36,938
Jenae,

183
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:40,006
hey, do you remember me?

184
00:06:40,006 --> 00:06:42,839
- [Kendra] Jenae, do you see Daddy?

185
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:44,506
- Hey, I missed you.

186
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:47,785
- [Kendra] She's been a fussy guest today.

187
00:06:47,785 --> 00:06:49,202
- Oh that's okay.

188
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:52,568
♫ I'm so glad when Daddy's home-

189
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:53,683
- It's good to be home.

190
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:56,678
♫ Glad as I can be

191
00:06:56,678 --> 00:07:00,347
♫ I clap my hands and jump for joy

192
00:07:00,347 --> 00:07:03,923
♫ And climb up on his knee

193
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,711
- You said you _ when you went to work.

194
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:07,461
- We made a skeleton.

195
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:10,494
- You did?

196
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:12,661
- [Laura] I made the hand.

197
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,997
- This is so cool.

198
00:07:15,997 --> 00:07:17,158
- [Kendra] Do you guys wanna tell him

199
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,691
the names we've been considering?

200
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,223
- Oh for the skeleton?

201
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:22,452
I was thinking about Herman.

202
00:07:22,452 --> 00:07:23,543
(laughter)

203
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:24,751
- [Kendra] It's a girl.

204
00:07:24,751 --> 00:07:25,584
- Sherman.

205
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,489
- [Kendra] That's not a girl's name.

206
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,718
- That's what you wanted to name Jenae.

207
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:32,692
- Sherman, that's right.

208
00:07:32,692 --> 00:07:34,805
30 minutes later.

209
00:07:34,805 --> 00:07:37,127
We're still snuggling.

210
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:39,294
(screams)

211
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,366
- Give me space, Jenae's like.

212
00:07:48,366 --> 00:07:50,850
I think she got some hair in her face.

213
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,638
- [Kendra] An hour later
and they're all still

214
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,263
within arms reach of Dad.

215
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:56,263
I think you were missed.

216
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,954
- How's that combing going Bud?

217
00:07:58,954 --> 00:07:59,999
- Good.

218
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,601
- You combing?

219
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,878
- [Kendra] Let's see it.

220
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:04,503
- Can I put some salt in it?

221
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:06,895
- [Kendra] No, we're not
gonna put salt in our hair.

222
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:10,750
- This is the kiddos and
this is the Mom and Dad's.

223
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,722
- [Jeremy] Are you eating them?

224
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:15,463
(laughter)

225
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:18,412
- I'm the Mommy, I'm
the Mom in this family.

226
00:08:18,412 --> 00:08:21,570
- There's the kiddos, can I have a kiddo?

227
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,451
- [Kendra] This is a creepy game.

228
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:25,843
- Like Hansel and Gretel.

229
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,073
- I'm thinking today's probably one of

230
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,838
the last warmer days of the year.

231
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:30,626
So I left Laura come out
and play with the ice

232
00:08:30,626 --> 00:08:32,066
because it's one of her favorite things.

233
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,806
You're melting your ice like a drink?

234
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,176
What are you guys playing?

235
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,093
- Football.

236
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,397
(calming music)

237
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,250
- [Kendra] So close.

238
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:49,736
Today we are doing my absolute

239
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:51,872
favorite math lesson with Elise.

240
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,823
- Greater than and less than.

241
00:08:53,823 --> 00:08:55,889
- [Kendra] Alright,
introduce us to our friends.

242
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,117
- This is greater than
and this is less than.

243
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:00,742
- [Kendra] Here's greater and less than.

244
00:09:00,742 --> 00:09:02,460
- I made her teeth special.

245
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,063
- [Kendra] You are an alligator,

246
00:09:04,063 --> 00:09:07,917
which one of these piles
do you want to eat?

247
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:11,331
That one, so which one do you need?

248
00:09:11,331 --> 00:09:12,164
Very nice.

249
00:09:13,792 --> 00:09:16,114
- [Elise] One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

250
00:09:16,114 --> 00:09:19,690
- [Kendra] Seven is greater than two.

251
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,711
Is that true?

252
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:21,733
- Yes.

253
00:09:21,733 --> 00:09:23,266
- [Kendra] Seven is greater than two.

254
00:09:23,266 --> 00:09:24,891
- So do I eat them?

255
00:09:24,891 --> 00:09:26,679
- [Kendra] You get to
eat the less than pile.

256
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,142
Alright, which pile do you want

257
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:29,581
to eat if you're an alligator?

258
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:31,114
- [Elise] One, two, three, four, five,

259
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:32,670
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

260
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,202
- [Kendra] How many are over here?

261
00:09:34,202 --> 00:09:35,224
- [Elise] Four.

262
00:09:35,224 --> 00:09:38,033
- [Kendra] So which one does
the alligator want to eat.

263
00:09:38,033 --> 00:09:40,616
- This, wait this is less than.

264
00:09:42,097 --> 00:09:44,860
- [Kendra] Correct, put it
on there and let's read it.

265
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,693
Say four

266
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:48,422
is less than 10.

267
00:09:49,481 --> 00:09:51,849
We always read this direction.

268
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:55,100
It was like four is less than 10.

269
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,981
- [Elise] Six is less than eight.

270
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,564
- [Kendra] Correct.

271
00:10:01,253 --> 00:10:03,645
Laura showed up, she's
never far from marshmallows.

272
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,667
We're getting it.

273
00:10:04,667 --> 00:10:06,037
You ready to start doing it on paper?

274
00:10:06,037 --> 00:10:07,787
Without marshmallows?

275
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:12,122
- [Elise] 11 is less than 21.

276
00:10:13,955 --> 00:10:15,325
- [Kendra] Good job.

277
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:18,320
Okay, let's do number five.

278
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,292
- [Jeremy] Oh, we're having
a marshmallow toss break.

279
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,542
(laughter)

280
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:26,560
Nailed it.

281
00:10:28,978 --> 00:10:30,603
Did you get it?

282
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:31,436
Whoa!

283
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:34,620
Nice.

284
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,870
Okay you guys I'm gonna
throw it above the house.

285
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm gonna throw the
marshmallow above the house

286
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,261
and catch it.

287
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:42,747
Here you wanna video it for me?

288
00:10:42,747 --> 00:10:44,860
Don't worry about following
the marshmallow up okay.

289
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,718
Isaac, you make sure it
goes above the house.

290
00:10:46,718 --> 00:10:47,885
- [Isaac] Yep.

291
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,745
- [Caleb] So close Dad.

292
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:56,857
Good job Dad.

293
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,605
- So the kids are all
having a friend over tonight

294
00:10:59,605 --> 00:11:01,416
so we're doing pizza for dinner.

295
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:03,529
Laura requested candy, but no.

296
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:04,737
We'll just do pizza.

297
00:11:04,737 --> 00:11:07,320
(upbeat music)

298
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:12,423
I'm cooking up the pizza,
our house is now full of kids

299
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:13,444
and fun.

300
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,325
I really, really love when
the kids have friends over

301
00:11:15,325 --> 00:11:16,858
and they're all playing so nicely.

302
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,042
It's just the best.

303
00:11:18,042 --> 00:11:20,178
It's like this happy kind of chaos running

304
00:11:20,178 --> 00:11:21,385
around my house.

305
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:22,732
They're playing all sorts
of different things.

306
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,543
I see a crochet game,
there's been some soccer,

307
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,401
some football playing,
there's playing house,

308
00:11:26,401 --> 00:11:28,978
there's jumping on the
trampoline, everything.

309
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:31,022
- So we're making eggs.

310
00:11:31,022 --> 00:11:32,276
- [Kendra] You're making eggs.

311
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:35,968
- I maked ice, so we are making ice.

312
00:11:35,968 --> 00:11:38,359
- [Kendra] So ice and eggs, yummy.

313
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,474
- For dinner.

314
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:42,057
(guitar music)

315
00:11:43,398 --> 00:11:45,348
- And yes, I already stole a slice.

316
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,881
I couldn't wait, I'm hungry.

317
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,344
Let's eat.

318
00:11:48,344 --> 00:11:50,927
(guitar music)

319
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,328
- Kendra and I were inside
and we see Lydia and Laura

320
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:00,534
like sitting down like
they're watching the kids

321
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:01,672
on the trampoline.

322
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:03,181
We thought that was pretty funny.

323
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,348
(giggles)

324
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:11,030
Are you girls watching them?

325
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,051
- Yep.

326
00:12:12,051 --> 00:12:13,421
- Goodnight, J House out.

327
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:15,651
I love watermelon.

328
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,484
- [Caleb] That's good.

329
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,596
- [Kendra] Really thinking about it.

330
00:12:20,596 --> 00:12:22,988
Next up hotdogs, chocolate, crackers, gum,

331
00:12:22,988 --> 00:12:25,449
ranch, will it pumpkin spice?

332
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:26,564
- No, no.

333
00:12:26,564 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
