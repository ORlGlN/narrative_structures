00:00:00,465 --> 00:00:04,632
♫ Old MacCaleb had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

2
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:09,287
♫ And sheep, baa, sheep, baa

3
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:14,804
♫ Old MacCaleb had a farm, E-I-E-I-O

4
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:18,586
♫ And on that farm on a cat

5
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,088
♫ E-I-E-I-O

6
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:23,996
♫ And a meow here and a meow here

7
00:00:23,996 --> 00:00:25,916
♫ And a meow here

8
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,845
♫ And meow here

9
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:32,335
♫ Old MacCaleb had a farm E-I-E-I-O

00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:36,502
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Pyotr I. Tchaikovsky)

11
00:00:40,097 --> 00:00:41,180
- Stop, stop.

12
00:00:43,788 --> 00:00:44,705
Stop, stop.

13
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:49,514
(children giggling)

14
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:50,978
Caleb.

15
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:53,978
(children giggling)

16
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,985
And there went a roll of tape.

17
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:03,500
Okay, what happened?

18
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,522
- I just putting the tape on all over us.

19
00:01:07,522 --> 00:01:09,025
Now we're stuck together.

20
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:11,025
- [Kendra] Can you walk?

21
00:01:13,376 --> 00:01:16,293
- Whoa! (giggling)

22
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:27,413
- I'm not!

23
00:01:27,413 --> 00:01:28,246
Oh, yeah!

24
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:32,451
- (Giggling) Oh, yeah!

25
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,106
- What are you guys doing now?

26
00:01:36,106 --> 00:01:39,032
(children giggling)

27
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:40,741
Caleb, what are you?

28
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,324
- A (mumbles).

29
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,339
- My turn!

30
00:01:43,339 --> 00:01:44,172
My turn.

31
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,586
- I am making dinner at lunch time.

32
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:48,867
Later this afternoon I have
a hectic afternoon time,

33
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,994
and I was worried about how
I was gonna make dinner work.

34
00:01:51,994 --> 00:01:53,496
And then I realized
we're all home together

35
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:55,492
at lunchtime anyway, might
as well cook it then.

36
00:01:55,492 --> 00:01:58,653
So we're gonna have creamy
chicken taquitos for lunch.

37
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,602
It is one of my favorite freezer meals.

38
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,553
Like, by far, hands down,
I haven't met anybody

39
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:05,033
who doesn't like it so
you really should try it.

40
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:06,859
And if you're new to the
idea of freezer meals,

41
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,683
it's a super-easy one to get started with.

42
00:02:08,683 --> 00:02:11,972
So, um, I guess I'm making
a plug for freezer meals.

43
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:13,192
Go freezer meals!

44
00:02:13,192 --> 00:02:15,143
Miss Elise is videoing for me.

45
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,947
Here I've got our bag of taquito innards

46
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:19,449
that was already cooked ahead of time

47
00:02:19,449 --> 00:02:22,251
and it's just been sitting
in this bag in my freezer.

48
00:02:22,251 --> 00:02:25,018
So I just got it and I snipped the top,

49
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:27,854
and then, come over here,
Leesie, and show 'em.

50
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:30,604
All I'm going to do is squeeze it

51
00:02:33,146 --> 00:02:33,979
like that.

52
00:02:35,344 --> 00:02:36,256
Into

53
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,109
(child calls out)

54
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:40,245
there.

55
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:42,524
And then I'm going to,
just a second, cubby.

56
00:02:42,524 --> 00:02:45,191
And then I'm going to roll it up

57
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:48,461
and put it on here.

58
00:02:49,312 --> 00:02:50,899
- That's it.

59
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,484
That's it!

60
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,071
- Usually I use smaller tortillas,

61
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:55,208
this is what we had in the freezer,

62
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,591
so that's what we're having for dinner.

63
00:02:56,591 --> 00:02:59,477
To finish these off, you
just spray it with PAM

64
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:02,198
and sprinkle some sea salt
or kosher salt over it.

65
00:03:02,198 --> 00:03:03,538
And then you bake it for 20 minutes,

66
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:06,584
and it gives it that
nice, crisp, fried taste

67
00:03:06,584 --> 00:03:09,629
without actually frying
it, which is awesome.

68
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,418
- Ding dong!

69
00:03:11,418 --> 00:03:13,855
- [Kendra] Who's this?

70
00:03:13,855 --> 00:03:15,355
- I'm Santa Claus.

71
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,263
- [Kendra] What do you say, Santa Claus?

72
00:03:19,263 --> 00:03:20,346
- Ho, ho, ho.

73
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:24,479
I'm saying, I have presents.

74
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,602
- [Kendra] Oh, you have presents?

75
00:03:28,602 --> 00:03:29,981
- [Dad] Can I have a present?

76
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:30,814
- Sure.

77
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:35,146
- [Dad] Okay, whose turn to pray?

78
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:36,728
- [Kendra] Caleb's turn.

79
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:37,561
- No.

80
00:03:38,965 --> 00:03:41,120
I'm Santa Claus.

81
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,542
- [Kendra] Oh, Santa
Claus is going to pray.

82
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:44,165
- Can you pray for us, Santa?

83
00:03:44,165 --> 00:03:46,726
And we're talking about Santa Claus,

84
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,410
and Elise thought that I
would make a good Santa Claus.

85
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,660
- Because he has a beard, and he's fat.

86
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,915
- I think!

87
00:03:55,915 --> 00:03:57,669
- I didn't say it.

88
00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:00,233
- That we should trim off all that beard,

89
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,064
put it on Caleb,

90
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:04,603
and color it with crayons.

91
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:06,393
- Well, we've had kind of a crazy evening.

92
00:04:06,393 --> 00:04:09,525
Our internet has been out
for the last 10 hours.

93
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:12,373
And that's had a little bit of an impact.

94
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:14,406
All of our kids are in
bed, Kendra's in bed,

95
00:04:14,406 --> 00:04:16,089
and I'm just finishing up some stuff

96
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,551
before heading off to bed

97
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:20,232
and getting ready for
another day tomorrow.

98
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:22,874
So every night there's
certain things that we do

99
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:23,893
before going to bed.

100
00:04:23,893 --> 00:04:26,457
And one of them is going in
and checking on the kids.

101
00:04:26,457 --> 00:04:29,221
They seem to always have their
blankets all over the place

102
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,619
and so we're gonna go in and make sure

103
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:34,176
that their blankets are on 'em.

104
00:04:34,176 --> 00:00:00,000
(soothing, upbeat music)
