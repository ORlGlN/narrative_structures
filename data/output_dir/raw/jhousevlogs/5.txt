1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:02,680
- [Kendra] Now we're
headed to an escape room.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,020
- [Jeremy] He's going!

3
00:00:08,044 --> 00:00:10,627
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,940
- So I am not a morning person.

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,480
I would rather stay in bed,

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,930
and I feel grumpy in the morning.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,390
But Janae is so happy in the morning

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,030
that I can't help but smile.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,077
I go and I get her out of her crib

10
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,360
and she just glows.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,270
She just radiates happiness

12
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:30,894
and she's blabbering away and signing

13
00:00:30,894 --> 00:00:34,730
and just the joy on her face
is completely contagious.

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,210
Each of the kids as they wake up

15
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,700
and come out, they see Janae
and they just light up.

16
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,340
And it's amazing how happiness
is contagious like that.

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm very grateful for
her joy in the morning.

18
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,000
Maybe I can become a morning person

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,835
if I hang out with her enough.

20
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:47,049
- Mama.
- Mama.

21
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,287
- Mama.
- [Kendra] Mama.

22
00:00:49,287 --> 00:00:50,589
- Mama, mama.

23
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:52,839
(babbling)

24
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:00,310
- [Jeremy] She wants to
watch Baby Saving Time.

25
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,410
- Can you blow kisses?

26
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,423
Yeah, that was a blowing kisses.

27
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,980
Can you give Mama kisses?

28
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:10,696
Aww, thank you.

29
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,083
(babbling)

30
00:01:16,123 --> 00:01:19,131
(laughing)

31
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:21,381
(babbling)

32
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,963
- [Jeremy] "Ew, Mom, you're salty."

33
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:33,713
(dramatic music)

34
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,427
So we're gonna add some black olives

35
00:01:50,427 --> 00:01:51,793
to some of these.

36
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,050
So Isaac started doing grateful olives.

37
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,158
- I'm grateful for sports.

38
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:03,160
- I'm grateful for families.

39
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,363
- I'm grateful for clean drinking water.

40
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,009
You might wanna scoot back, Isaac.

41
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:11,062
Caleb can hit the ball pretty hard.

42
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,404
(Jeremy groaning)

43
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,150
Nice!

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,650
- That was pretty hard, like--

45
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,303
- [Jeremy] Man, hit,
he's going, he's going.

46
00:02:31,562 --> 00:02:33,873
So did you guys have
your snowballs out here?

47
00:02:33,873 --> 00:02:36,430
- They got destroyed in the night.

48
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,670
- [Isaac] Here, Dad, pitch to me.

49
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,503
- [Jeremy] Did you guys come out

50
00:02:38,503 --> 00:02:40,563
in the middle of the
night and destroy them?

51
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:41,509
- [Caleb] No, they got destroyed.

52
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,842
Now we're making a calendar.

53
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,963
- [Jeremy] Whoa, into the tree!

54
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:49,552
Get him!

55
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,143
Oh, almost!

56
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:56,288
- I'm gonna kick you, ya!

57
00:02:56,288 --> 00:02:58,538
(shouting)

58
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,130
- So we're running several
errands this morning.

59
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,430
Caleb is my little helper.

60
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,608
First stop, I'm dropping off all

61
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,970
of my documents to my accounts for taxes.

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,863
Yeah, taxes are done!

63
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,460
Yeah, we're out of gas.

64
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,945
(mellow jazz)

65
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,463
Full!

66
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:36,618
(fast-paced electronic music)

67
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:43,540
Plumbing!
We need the one-inch

68
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,280
connectors.
So we came to get a couple

69
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,947
more connectors for our kids' PVC pipe

70
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,771
building kit that we made for them.

71
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,492
So here's the one-inch ones.

72
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,803
Let's look for the
connectors we're needing.

73
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,563
- We found it.

74
00:03:56,563 --> 00:03:57,690
- [Jeremy] Yep, this is the one we need.

75
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:58,884
- [Caleb] Should we take the whole box?

76
00:03:58,884 --> 00:04:00,223
- [Jeremy] We need it.

77
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:03,140
- There's a whole entire 'nother box.

78
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,242
- Oh good, we needed a lot more.

79
00:04:05,242 --> 00:04:09,659
("Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" by Mozart)

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,350
So I have a car where I still physically

81
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,529
roll down my window.

82
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,364
Let me know in the poll

83
00:04:17,365 --> 00:04:20,970
if your car has automatic
window rolling-down system

84
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,250
or manual, with your hand.

85
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,360
- So for Spanish today, we're trying

86
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,470
to do a little activity

87
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,780
with play food down here.

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,732
We're gonna see if the kids can ask

89
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,030
for what they want

90
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,069
and remember the word in Spanish.

91
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:30,959
- Hola.

92
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,095
- Hola, buenos dias.

93
00:04:32,095 --> 00:04:33,613
- Buenos dias, que quieres comprar hoy?

94
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:37,656
- Quiero el pollo y las uvas.

95
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,138
- El pollo y las uvas.

96
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,065
- Ya esta gracias.

97
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:43,094
- De nada.

98
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:45,060
- [Jeremy] She wants something.

99
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,004
- Que quieres?

100
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:46,997
Quieres agua?

101
00:04:46,997 --> 00:04:48,494
- [Jeremy] Gracias.

102
00:04:48,494 --> 00:04:50,277
(laughter)

103
00:04:50,277 --> 00:04:51,110
- Hola.
- Hola.

104
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,047
- [Kendra] Que quieres comprar?

105
00:04:52,047 --> 00:04:52,880
- Quiero

106
00:04:56,252 --> 00:04:57,520
el pan.

107
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,353
- El pan.

108
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:04,718
- Y--?

109
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:09,939
- Y la leche?

110
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:11,103
- Yeah.
- Say sí.

111
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:14,680
- Sí.
- Sí.

112
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,658
Can you say gracias?

113
00:05:15,658 --> 00:05:17,050
- Gracias.

114
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,883
- De nada.

115
00:05:17,883 --> 00:05:18,939
- [Jeremy] Hello.

116
00:05:18,939 --> 00:05:21,398
She's coming to play peek-a-boo with me.

117
00:05:21,398 --> 00:05:23,633
Hey, peek-a-boo.

118
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,477
Peek-a-boo.

119
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:30,185
(Kendra laughing)

120
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,930
- [Kendra] Uh-oh.

121
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,037
- [Jeremy] Peek-a-boo.

122
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:35,370
- [Kendra] To properly play peek-a-boo,

123
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,680
you have to move your
head all the way sideways.

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,580
Poor Jeremy, it's hard
being a work-at-home dad

125
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,740
when you've got this cuteness.

126
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,853
- [Jeremy] Get over here.

127
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,842
- Quiero la manzana.

128
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:52,600
- [Kendra] La manzana, o!

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,066
No tenemos manzanas hoy, lo siento.

130
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,559
- [Jeremy] She's so sad.

131
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:59,316
- Quieres un platano?

132
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,983
No?
Quieres las uvas?

133
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:05,400
- [Kendra And Laura] Sí.

134
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,240
- [Kendra] Hola.

135
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,073
- Hola.

136
00:06:08,073 --> 00:06:08,906
- Que quieres?

137
00:06:08,906 --> 00:06:11,199
- Yo quiero Taco Bell.

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,357
(laughter)

139
00:06:12,357 --> 00:06:13,190
Tacos, burritos.

140
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,500
- No tenemos tacos.

141
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,615
Lo siento.

142
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:16,448
- Queso.

143
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:18,415
Gracias.

144
00:06:18,415 --> 00:06:20,210
(laughter)

145
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,291
I'm still learning Spanish.

146
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,157
It's pretty slow process.

147
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:28,420
Good job, Elise.

148
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,003
(upbeat music)

149
00:06:51,095 --> 00:06:53,338
- Everything's upside down.

150
00:06:53,338 --> 00:06:55,670
(laughs)

151
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,750
- We're wanting to have Elise have

152
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,000
some more practice on her addition

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,190
and subtraction math facts.

154
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,100
We wanna make it fun,

155
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,380
so I downloaded a few new math apps today

156
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,824
and the favorite one that we've tried is

157
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,560
called Operation Math

158
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,900
and you get to be a secret agent

159
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,380
and try to do addition facts

160
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,435
and subtraction to open
secret access doors

161
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:12,990
and hopefully complete
your mission on time.

162
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:13,823
It's really fun.

163
00:07:13,823 --> 00:07:14,890
I love it when learning can be fun,

164
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:17,300
especially with something
like drilling facts.

165
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,133
Flash cards aren't fun,

166
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,936
and these app games can be awesome.

167
00:07:19,936 --> 00:07:22,853
(video game music)

168
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,010
You got this, Leesy.

169
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,433
You're almost there.

170
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:29,509
- I like being secret agents.

171
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:31,810
- [Kendra] You feel sneaky?

172
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,160
What about that timer,
is it pretty intense?

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,369
- It's intense.

174
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:37,560
- So we're cleaning up the house again

175
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,240
for what feels like the fourth time.

176
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,380
Playing some music.

177
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,473
We're all working together.

178
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:43,511
Nae Nae's dancing for us.

179
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,693
Good job, Nae Nae.

180
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,923
Yeah!

181
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,754
(gentle music)

182
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,570
- Tonight is fun.

183
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,870
Jeremy and I are going on a date.

184
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,800
We're going out to dinner

185
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,060
and to an escape room game

186
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,010
and the kids are going to a gymnastics

187
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,413
parents' night out glow-in-the-dark night,

188
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:05,810
so win-win-win-win.

189
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,695
They get to have fun at the gym

190
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,810
and we get to go have fun too.

191
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,990
And we get to keep Janae with us.

192
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,387
And that's even gonna be more fun.

193
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:14,220
(Classical music)

194
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,270
We're going to a crepe place

195
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,190
and I'm really excited.

196
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,996
I was looking up early
today restaurants downtown

197
00:08:24,996 --> 00:08:27,398
and nothing really sounded super inspired,

198
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:29,903
but my friend knows of a crepe place!

199
00:08:32,647 --> 00:08:34,886
Drink, drink, there it is.

200
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:37,469
(upbeat music)

201
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,140
Now we're headed to an escape room.

202
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,236
- We have our secret weapon with us.

203
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:55,683
- [Kendra] Janae is the
mastermind behind the plans.

204
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,563
She's so precious.

205
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,107
- This is the room that we're going

206
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:04,793
to be trying to break out of.

207
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:05,970
I'm excited, I love these things.

208
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,183
- We have 60 minutes.

209
00:09:07,183 --> 00:09:08,150
- I think we can do it.

210
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,983
- Yes!

211
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,730
- We got out, 13 minutes remaining.

212
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:13,644
It was really, really fun.

213
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:16,045
We did have to get one hint.

214
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:17,515
We did it.

215
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,348
(fast-paced electronic music)

216
00:09:27,676 --> 00:09:28,518
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae's out.

217
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:29,351
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness.

218
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,883
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae's going.

219
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,979
Well, gymnastics was a hit.

220
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,450
- Oh my goodness, they loved this.

221
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,827
- [Jeremy] So how did you like it?

222
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:40,960
- It was so much fun.

223
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,950
(babbling)

224
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,199
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae, Nae Nae.

225
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:46,564
- Good night, J House out.

226
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:48,647
(laughs)

227
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,410
- [Jeremy] Whoa!

228
00:09:57,410 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughter)
