00:00:00,181 --> 00:00:02,308
- Jeremy had to go to
work early this morning

2
00:00:02,308 --> 00:00:04,252
and so I'm doing morning duty.

3
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:05,994
We all know how much I love that.

00:00:13,516 --> 00:00:16,693
Isaac wrote this Post-It
note and is wearing it today.

6
00:00:16,693 --> 00:00:20,686
It says "I eat healthy, what about you?"

7
00:00:20,686 --> 00:00:23,019
- I eat healthy the whole...

8
00:00:24,623 --> 00:00:26,818
The whole December.

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,698
- [Kendra] Why do you want to eat healthy?

10
00:00:28,698 --> 00:00:30,450
- So I can have a good diet.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:33,569
So I can play good at
football and baseball.

12
00:00:33,569 --> 00:00:35,203
- [Kendra] There's Miss Laura!

13
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,220
She needed a bath, Laura!

14
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,053
(Laura vocalizes)

15
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:40,714
Laura, can you say hi to Mama?

16
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:42,134
Laura.

17
00:00:42,134 --> 00:00:44,967
(Laura vocalizes)

18
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:49,961
So I didn't get to video
this, but I was bathing Laura

19
00:00:49,961 --> 00:00:52,139
real quick, maybe like two minutes.

20
00:00:52,139 --> 00:00:53,266
All of a sudden, I was
like "Wait a minute,

21
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:54,100
Where is Caleb?"

22
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,891
So I had Elise run to see where he was

23
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,806
and he was on top of the
counter, having unwrapped

24
00:00:57,806 --> 00:01:00,442
a bunch of gum and
chewing and swallowing it.

25
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:03,658
So I had to grab her out
of the tub and run out

26
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:04,632
and grab him.

27
00:01:04,632 --> 00:01:08,727
So, yup, the morning's
off to a normal start.

28
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:10,252
- Baby Jesus.

29
00:01:10,252 --> 00:01:12,385
- [Kendra] Yay, this
is our Baby Jesus toy!

30
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:14,196
Okay Caleb, let's dump all the pieces out.

31
00:01:14,196 --> 00:01:15,235
Let's see what we got.

34
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:21,606
You like that, Laura?

35
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:24,106

Baby Jesus.

38
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:34,889
- [Kendra] Why are you
putting Baby Jesus in there?

39
00:01:34,889 --> 00:01:37,590
- (shrieks) I can't put the lid on.

40
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,757
- [Kendra] Why are you trying
to put the lid on Baby Jesus?

41
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:45,820
- Baby Jesus die.

42
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,928
In a field...

44
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:50,480
Aah!

45
00:01:51,922 --> 00:01:53,194
Whoah!

47
00:01:54,956 --> 00:01:55,903
- [Kendra] Cubby, Cubby.

48
00:01:55,903 --> 00:01:56,941
You gotta give one to Laura.

49
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:57,802
(Laura cries)

50
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:58,701
Caleb, which one's for Laura?

51
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,793
Give Laura one.

52
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:01,221
(Laura wails)

53
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:02,471
Give Laura one.

54
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:05,337
Give Laura one.

(Laura vocalizes)

57
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:22,236
Yesterday, I got out these cupcake liners

58
00:02:22,236 --> 00:02:23,607
and I challenged the kids to make

59
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:24,855
a Christmas tree with them.

60
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,324
And they were super
creative, I didn't give them

61
00:02:26,324 --> 00:02:28,336
any more direction than that.

62
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:30,751
And they all went
three-dimensional and were trying

63
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,751
to make Christmas trees.

64
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:38,320
- Hello.

65
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,798
- [Kendra] (laughs) You have
a talking Christmas tree?

66
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:45,590
Well, I'd actually seen a
craft doing this on Pinterest.

67
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,918
They did awesome on their
Christmas trees yesterday,

68
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,885
but I think they'll
also enjoy making these.

69
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:51,940
(children vocalizing)

70
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,523
That looks awesome!

71
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,959
I had such a hard time getting the glue

72
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:57,398
on each individual sequin.

73
00:02:57,398 --> 00:02:59,749
He just put the glue all over the tree.

74
00:02:59,749 --> 00:03:00,999
Genius! Genius!

75
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:07,688
Genius (laughs)!

76
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:10,738
Oh my goodness, your tree is so circular!

77
00:03:10,738 --> 00:03:11,916
It's lovely!

78
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:12,999
Are you done?

79
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,625
Oh. Awesomesauce.

80
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:19,520
So here they are!

81
00:03:22,424 --> 00:03:25,518
- So our internet was out
most of yesterday and today.

82
00:03:25,518 --> 00:03:28,584
But look, it's getting fixed!

83
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,417
We're so happy.

84
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,635
What's your name?

85
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:31,468
- Tina.

86
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:32,962
- Tina is fixing it for us!

87
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,170
- [Kendra] Yay Tina!

88
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,631
- Aw man, we are so happy
to have internet back.

89
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,776
It's amazing how much you use something

90
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:41,401
and you don't realize it until it's gone.

91
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:42,234
- Everything shuts down.

92
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:44,137
We couldn't watch Netflix,
our printers, our Wi-Fi.

93
00:03:44,137 --> 00:03:45,490
So I couldn't print anything.

94
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:48,206
And then there's of
course the whole YouTube,

95
00:03:48,206 --> 00:03:49,745
vlogging, uploading.

96
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:52,828

00:03:56,658 --> 00:04:00,825

(Elise vocalizes)

100
00:04:09,764 --> 00:04:12,947
- So I accidentally brought
the camera in to work with me.

101
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:15,825
At lunch time I was videoing
something, and I put it

102
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:17,735
in my pocket and I just came up to work.

103
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:19,238
And Kendra called me
and she was like "Hey,

104
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:20,539
I can't find the camera anywhere.

105
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:23,992
"I've been looking and
looking, where is it?"

106
00:04:23,992 --> 00:04:25,155
It was in my pocket.

107
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:26,133
So sorry Kendra.

108
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,069
So we're eating and
Kendra wanted to put on

109
00:04:28,069 --> 00:04:32,236
a dinner show for our guests
who are eating dinner with us.

110
00:04:34,286 --> 00:04:35,352
Alright.

111
00:04:35,352 --> 00:04:36,771
- [Kendra] Ready?

112
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:40,358
(silly instrumental music)

113
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:43,358
(children laughing)

114
00:05:04,474 --> 00:05:06,514
- [Jeremy] Okay, who's dancing was better?

115
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:07,597
- You! Yours!

116
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,040
- [Jeremy] Yeah!

117
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,437
- What?

118
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,541
(children cheering)

119
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:14,277
Ready balloon, ready?

120
00:05:14,277 --> 00:05:17,027

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,600

(children laughing)

124
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:32,611
Alright.

125
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:34,676
- I was helping at the church.

126
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:36,479
We have our Christmas party tomorrow

127
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,312
and we were setting up
325 chairs with tables.

128
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:42,954
I think that's going to
be enough, but we'll see.

129
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:46,175
It was a little bit of a task.
