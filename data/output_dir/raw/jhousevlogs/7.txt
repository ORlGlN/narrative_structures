1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,413
- Ready, set go!

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,877
(upbeat piano music)

3
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:08,269
(children speaking foreign language)

4
00:00:08,269 --> 00:00:09,731
- Wow!

5
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:11,775
(horn noise)

6
00:00:11,775 --> 00:00:12,608
(laughter)

7
00:00:12,608 --> 00:00:15,691
(upbeat piano music)

8
00:00:19,588 --> 00:00:20,609
- [Kendra] Good morning!

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,442
- Good morning.

10
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:22,750
- [Kendra] What are we doing this morning?

11
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,190
- We're making cinnamon pancakes.

12
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,140
- [Kendra] Starting the day
off with cinnamon oat pancakes.

13
00:00:29,224 --> 00:00:30,756
- Yum.

14
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:34,089
(indiscernible singing)

15
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:48,519
- Nae-nae still has some _ in her hair.

16
00:00:50,099 --> 00:00:52,503
- [Kendra] You've got
some good dance moves.

17
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:56,810
(upbeat piano music)

18
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,530
This morning it is my turn to host Laura's

19
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,020
preschool group and we are focusing on

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,250
learning the ABCs.

21
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,577
Close your eyes and I want
you to think of your name.

22
00:01:15,577 --> 00:01:16,670
- [Jeremy] Close your eyes Laura.

23
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,980
- [Kendra] And I want
you to think of the first

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,840
letter in your name.

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,487
And then when I count to
three, we're gonna all shout

26
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:25,130
the first letter in our name.

27
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,667
Ready?

28
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:28,641
One, two, three.

29
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:30,891
(shouting)

30
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,460
Today we are going to learn about letters.

31
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,030
Raise your hand if you
know one of the letters.

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,227
Does anybody know one of the letters?

33
00:01:40,227 --> 00:01:41,249
What's a letter?

34
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:42,619
- N.

35
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:43,452
- [Kendra] N, that's a great letter.

36
00:01:43,452 --> 00:01:46,010
- [All] A, B, C, D

37
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,423
E, F, G.

38
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,540
- While Kendra's doing singing time,

39
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,859
our bigger kids are
hiding eggs for the kids.

40
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:55,359
(piano music)

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,039
- It's pink.

42
00:01:59,012 --> 00:02:00,290
- [Jeremy] Good one.

43
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,790

44
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:11,133

45
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,269

00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,186

♪ Lalalala ♪

48
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,514

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,153
- [Kendra] Ready, get your legs ready.

55
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:47,632
Oh, put it on your elbows.

56
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,702
You want me to do it again for you?

57
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:50,535
Ready, there it goes.

58
00:02:50,535 --> 00:02:52,163

00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,788

60
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:54,810
- I caught it.

61
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,832
- You caught it.

62
00:02:55,832 --> 00:02:56,920
- [Jeremy] Good throw.

63
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,849
- The eggs downstairs do
not have any candy in them.

64
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:00,682
But we're gonna work together as a team

65
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:01,980
to find all the eggs.

66
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,773
We're gonna bring them upstairs

67
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:04,880
and have a snack at the table.

68
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,460
These eggs are special eggs.

69
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,957
Do you know what makes them special?

70
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:09,485
- [Child What?

71
00:03:09,485 --> 00:03:11,200
- They have the letters
of the alphabet on them.

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,013
- [Jeremy] That's better than candy.

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,149
(upbeat music)

74
00:03:16,149 --> 00:03:17,566
- Ready, set, go.

75
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:21,580
Good job.

76
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:25,112
- [Child] I found one.

77
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:26,737
- [Child] I found one in the _.

78
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,570
- [Child] I found one.

79
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:30,917
- [Child] I found this one.

80
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,891
- [Child] Found one.

81
00:03:32,891 --> 00:03:33,724
Found one.

82
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:36,118
- [Child] Found two of them.

83
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:36,951
- [Child] I found one.

84
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,730
- [Kendra] Alright, shall
we see if we got them all?

85
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:42,873
I spy with my little eye one that's blue.

86
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:45,403
- Found it.

87
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:46,869
- A,

88
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:47,891
B,

89
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,724
C,

90
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:50,070
everybody pass them on.

91
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,903
D.

92
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,983
An egg, are you excited about those eggs?

93
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:58,810
(upbeat guitar music)

94
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,310
A told B and B told C,

95
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,830
I'll meet you at the
top of the coconut tree.

96
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:06,676
Skinny D and stub toe E.

97
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:08,208
It's parachute time.

98
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,625
(rock music)

99
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:36,119
Teddy bear, turn around.

100
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:39,602
Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the ground.

101
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:42,685
Teddy bear, teddy bear say goodnight.

102
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:46,359
- That was too fast.

103
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,332
- Do you think we can do it faster?

104
00:04:48,332 --> 00:04:50,538
Teddy bear, teddy bear turn around.

105
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,676
Teddy bear, teddy bear touch the ground.

106
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,441
Teddy bear, teddy bear show your shoes.

107
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,718
Teddy bear, teddy bear that will do.

108
00:04:54,718 --> 00:04:57,272
Teddy bear, teddy bear say goodnight.

109
00:04:57,272 --> 00:04:59,478
If only it really were
nap time, but it's not.

110
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:00,473
- [Jeremy] It's nap time for this girl.

111
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,570
So all of Laura's friends are gone

112
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,720
but now our kids are
still wanting to play.

113
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,534
- And stop.

114
00:05:08,534 --> 00:05:09,462
One,

115
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:10,507
two,

116
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:11,784
three.

117
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:14,034
(laughter)

118
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:16,542
- Two,

119
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:17,845
three.

120
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:18,867
Let go.

121
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:19,888
Wait no.

122
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:20,910
(laughter)

123
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,024
- [Jeremy] She got it right that time.

124
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:22,857
- We're proud of myself
because I remembered

125
00:05:22,857 --> 00:05:24,290
to put a freezer meal in
the crock pot this morning.

126
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,590
So we're gonna be having
honey sesame chicken thighs

127
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,650
with rice and veggies tonight.

128
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,500
I wish this was like smellevision

129
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,683
because this smells so good.

130
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:35,213
- Yes.

131
00:05:36,607 --> 00:05:40,923
- Isaac is doing an online Spanish class.

132
00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:43,916
- Isn't that banana?

133
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:45,953
I know _, watermelon.

134
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:50,587
I see banano.

135
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:55,661
(speaking Spanish)

136
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:12,714
- I'm doing letters with this lipstick.

137
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:14,880
- [Kendra] Are you gonna
write with lipstick?

138
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,760
Okay, let's take it out.

139
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,110
Let's see what color it is.

140
00:06:17,955 --> 00:06:19,630
Somebody's pretty excited.

141
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,593
I want you to write the letter L.

142
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:25,362
(orchestral music)

143
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:26,300
- Can put some on my lips?

144
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,133
- [Kendra] Sure.

145
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:30,070
That is a very pinky pink.

146
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,320
So honestly Laura has
not been super interested

147
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,420
in learning her letters yet,

148
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,370
which I'm not worried about.

149
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,392
She's only four.

150
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:37,350
But when I was at the store, I saw this

151
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,940
and it was only $1 and I
was like, you know what,

152
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,660
I might as well speak Laura's language

153
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,530
which is makeup and see
if that might get her

154
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,010
interested in learning her letters

155
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,760
and writing them a little bit more.

156
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:49,762
- That is beautiful.

157
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,800
- [Kendra] Very good.

158
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,900
- Can I put some of this
lipstick on your lips?

159
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,476
- [Kendra] When we're done.

160
00:06:57,476 --> 00:06:58,450
- Okay and Elise's?

161
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,192
- [Kendra] Okay Laura, we're gonna

162
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:01,760
try to learn a new letter.

163
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,930
What's this letter?

164
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:03,763
- I don't know.

165
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,508
- [Kendra] Do you recognize it?

166
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:07,341
- No.

167
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:08,190
- [Kendra] It's a J.

168
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,200
- J.

169
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,547
- [Kendra] What's J at the beginning of?

170
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:12,380
- Jump.

171
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,360
- [Kendra] Jump is a good one.

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,993
How about J House?

173
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,047
- J House too.

174
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,063
- [Kendra] Are you ready to
put some makeup on me now?

175
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,685
Wow, that is some pink.

176
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:30,602
(orchestral music)

177
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,295
- [Jeremy] I don't think
we're gonna get one that big.

178
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:40,320
We're wanting to get a bunch of PVC pipe

179
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,083
so that we can make PVC
forts with the kids.

180
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:47,483
(orchestral music)

181
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,837
- It's like an adventure.

182
00:07:53,784 --> 00:07:57,130
(orchestral music)

183
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,663
- [Jeremy] Whoa, someone has lipstick on.

184
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,340
Four of these we wanna
measure six feet long

185
00:08:07,786 --> 00:08:09,156
and then make a mark.

186
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,573
(rock music)

187
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:19,694
Push down.

188
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,393
Push down.

189
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,730
Alright, how'd it go cutting them?

190
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,440
- Really smooth and it wasn't too hard.

191
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,870
- It is funny when Kendra
talked to me about doing this

192
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,710
I wasn't sure at first
how I would cut the pipes.

193
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,840
It just sounded like it might be a pain.

194
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,590
Then once we went and asked some questions

195
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,200
and figured out how to do
it, it really is pretty easy.

196
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,169
- So many things in life,
they sound intimidating

197
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,789
but then once you do them and figure out

198
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,190
and ask the right questions,
it's not that hard.

199
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:48,560
- [Jeremy] Alright.

200
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,710
- [Caleb] It's so easy.

201
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,860
- [Kendra] How in the world?

202
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,643
That's crazy.

203
00:08:54,643 --> 00:08:55,735
- And feel it.

204
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:57,340
- [Kendra] This is so
smooth, that's crazy.

205
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,890
- That's the hardest part.

206
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,470
- [Kendra] That's what
he uses his muscles for.

207
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,910
- Alright, who wants to try?

208
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,862
- Me.

209
00:09:03,862 --> 00:09:05,046
- Try to do it all by yourself.

210
00:09:05,046 --> 00:09:07,296
(groaning)

211
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,491
You gotta have enough weight.

212
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:12,372
So maybe-
- All my weight.

213
00:09:12,372 --> 00:09:13,480
(laughter)

214
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,730
- [Kendra] Was that hard?

215
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,480
- Yeah, watching Daddy it seems like that.

216
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,313
- [Kendra] Easy?

217
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,060
- [Jeremy] Push a little harder.

218
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:24,118
Harder.

219
00:09:24,118 --> 00:09:25,514
- [Elise] Can I help him?

220
00:09:25,514 --> 00:09:26,347
(laughter)

221
00:09:26,347 --> 00:09:27,240
- Well I'm feeling really
grateful right now.

222
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,970
I haven't been doing great
recently at menu planning,

223
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,730
but I'm trying to get back
into the groove of it.

224
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,800
And today I successful
had our dinner all planned

225
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,420
and cooking when I heard
about an older couple

226
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,580
from our church
congregation that's just had

227
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,770
a rough day and I was able to
offer to bring them dinner.

228
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,080
It felt so good to be able to offer that

229
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,900
and have it not be a big
deal because we're ready

230
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,570
and there's more than enough to share.

231
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,230
I just want to do a better
job at preparing myself

232
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,070
so that I'm in a place where I can serve

233
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,150
and give to others.

234
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,640
That's where I want to be.

235
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,380
- [Jeremy] Alright,
here's all of our pieces

236
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,832
for our PVC building kit.

237
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,830
- Can we make one big fort?

238
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,190
- [Jeremy] Yep, make
whatever you guys want.

239
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,620
- [Caleb] Our thing is
gonna be exactly six foot.

240
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,046
I need a corner piece everyone.

241
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,629
(upbeat music)

242
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:24,161
- Strongest Dad on Earth.

243
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,760
- [Jeremy] Good job Nae-nae.

244
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:32,455
(laughter)

245
00:10:33,618 --> 00:10:37,032
- We're going to make a tube
system between the hallways.

246
00:10:37,032 --> 00:10:38,216
- [Jeremy] Like a telephone?

247
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:40,799
(upbeat music)

248
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:45,043
- Six foot.

249
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,157
- [Jeremy] Oh is the phone gonna

250
00:10:46,157 --> 00:10:48,293
go all the way up to your bed?

251
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:49,126
I love it.

252
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:52,357
- It's not gonna be able to,

253
00:10:52,357 --> 00:10:53,507
it's not sturdy enough.

254
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:55,910
Talk to me again.

255
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,773
- Oh hey dude.

256
00:10:58,348 --> 00:11:00,368
- I can hear you perfectly.

257
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:02,951
(upbeat music)

258
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,284
- So right now we can talk to everybody.

259
00:11:09,284 --> 00:11:12,001
(upbeat music)

260
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:13,668
- How's it going yo?

261
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,784
- [Child] Good yo.

262
00:11:16,784 --> 00:11:18,828
(giggles)

263
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:20,801
- [Laura] How's it doing yo?

264
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,301
(piano music)

265
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:36,630
- No I haven't seen it.

266
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,402
- I'm gonna show the kids something cool

267
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:40,153
Watch.

268
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:43,688
(piano music)

269
00:11:46,901 --> 00:11:49,151
- [Caleb] That's beautiful.

270
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:53,453
- [Jeremy] Do you hear the music?

271
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,570
Whoa, you can hear it like really good.

272
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,420
- [Caleb] I know.

273
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,690
I can blow to everyone and
it'll be like air conditioning.

274
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:12,590
- [Jeremy] Try it.

275
00:12:14,364 --> 00:12:16,614
- I hear ya, I can feel it.

276
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:21,027
We're giving you guys air conditioning.

277
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,859
(laughter)

278
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:25,692
- I'm gonna see if I
can blow strong enough

279
00:12:25,692 --> 00:12:26,960
to get it over to the girls.

280
00:12:29,294 --> 00:12:31,461
(giggles)

281
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,440
Mom, if you want we could
have one right here for you.

282
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,947
We'll make it-

283
00:12:42,947 --> 00:12:44,666
- [Kendra] I wanted it to
all the way into our room.

284
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,036
- We could do that.

285
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:47,731
Kids, wake up.

286
00:12:47,731 --> 00:12:48,752
We'll just do it from here.

287
00:12:48,752 --> 00:12:51,144
- [Kendra] No, it's more
like kids, go to bed.

288
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:52,540
- We thought about doing that.

289
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,579
- Everybody could talk to
each other in the nighttime,

290
00:12:55,579 --> 00:12:57,042
the whole time.

291
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,689
- [Kendra] Uh oh, this
might not go with bedtime.

292
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:01,670
I'm crazy impressed.

293
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,540
I thought for sure Jeremy had
helped the kids with that.

294
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,360
But the kids apparently
did it all on their own.

295
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,920
That's amazing to me.

296
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,003
Anyone that can hear me, go to bed.

297
00:13:10,602 --> 00:13:12,831
(laughter)

298
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,310
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

299
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,430
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

300
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,263
- Bye
- Bye.

301
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,914
- [Kendra] What are you guys doing??

302
00:13:19,914 --> 00:13:21,260
- Vlogging.

303
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,080
(upbeat music)

304
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:27,414
- I decided when I'm older,
I'm never gonna grow up.

305
00:13:27,414 --> 00:13:29,202
- [Jeremy] Laura, you're doing awesome.

306
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,223
- Thanks.

307
00:13:30,223 --> 00:00:00,000
- Isaac's doing the coolest
thing, you gotta see this.
