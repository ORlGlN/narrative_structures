1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:02,735
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:10,109
- Alright,

3
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:14,514
we're in Bret and Michelle's
basement on a Sunday.

4
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,523
This is my Mom, Granny Jo.

5
00:00:16,523 --> 00:00:17,356
- Hello.

6
00:00:18,498 --> 00:00:22,257
- Kendra was wanting you
to tell us some funny

7
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:24,120
something something from what is was like,

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,772
a story from raising me or
something about us growing up.

9
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:30,769
You got anything up your sleeve?

10
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,769
- Jeremy liked to really
kind of push my buttons

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,449
and so his punishment of course
was that we would put him

12
00:00:39,449 --> 00:00:41,492
in the laundry room for time out.

13
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:44,812
We'd sit him up on top of
the washing machine or dryer

14
00:00:44,812 --> 00:00:46,243
and he would kick and kick and kick

15
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:48,224
and kick the entire time he was there.

16
00:00:48,224 --> 00:00:49,104
(laughing)

17
00:00:49,104 --> 00:00:51,223
- I wanted to make sure
to make it a punishment

18
00:00:51,223 --> 00:00:53,286
for everybody who was trying to punish me.

19
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:56,824
- And real often we would
get around the table,

20
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,490
be about ready to say
the blessing on the food

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,152
and Jeremy would go (spitting).

22
00:01:01,152 --> 00:01:02,295
(laughing)

23
00:01:02,295 --> 00:01:05,306
And we were just about ready
and then he'd go (spitting),

24
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:06,584
make everyone laugh.

25
00:01:06,584 --> 00:01:08,296
So I said, "Okay, you do
that one more time, Jeremy,

26
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:09,909
"I'm gonna have to rip out your tongue."

27
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:10,742
- How old?

28
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:11,656
I was like five.

29
00:01:11,656 --> 00:01:12,489
- You were two.

30
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,322
- Two?

31
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:14,155
- And have three.

32
00:01:14,155 --> 00:01:15,189
Caleb's age.

33
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,230
- So Caleb.

34
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,063
- Yeah, Caleb's age.

35
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:17,896
- Okay.

36
00:01:17,896 --> 00:01:19,828
- And so as soon as I said that of course

37
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:23,048
Jeremy goes (spitting)
and so I grabbed his mouth

38
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:25,270
and I tried to rip out his tongue,

39
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,566
but it really did not work

40
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:29,663
because he ran and he
ran faster than I did.

41
00:01:29,663 --> 00:01:32,045
- I remember a lot of times
just trying to make my mom laugh

42
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:33,441
if she was trying to discipline me

43
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:34,785
(laughs)

44
00:01:34,785 --> 00:01:36,706
that was a key of my survival

45
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:38,398
which is exactly what Caleb does.

46
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:39,495
It's really funny.

47
00:01:39,495 --> 00:01:41,139
You guys are gettin' it goin'.

48
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:43,240
Oh, as soon as I show.

49
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,139
- Thanks a lot.

50
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:44,972
- [Jeremy] Sorry.

51
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:47,805
Sorry, as soon as I start filming.

52
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,762
Wow.

53
00:01:50,762 --> 00:01:52,331
Okay, well we're gonna
have to get some doubles

54
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:54,083
going on in a second.

55
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:54,916
What?

56
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:56,244
(laughing)

57
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:57,661
That was amazing.

58
00:01:58,555 --> 00:01:59,931
Well, thanks for telling a story, Mom.

59
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:00,764
That was awesome.

60
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:04,755
Elise, you have some pretty
awesome makeup on today.

61
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:05,736
She gave me a little kiss.

62
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:06,569
It was cute.

63
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:08,526
Kendra was like, "Who kissed you?"

64
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:11,760
And then Elise walked up with her makeup.

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,324
So we have some sad news though.

66
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:15,630
Our little baby Laura...

67
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,874
I'll take this ridiculous hat off.

68
00:02:17,874 --> 00:02:22,091
Baby Laura is, she has
a temperature right now

69
00:02:22,091 --> 00:02:23,674
and that's not fun.

70
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:28,075
- Hi.

71
00:02:28,075 --> 00:02:30,408
- So she's just not herself.

72
00:02:31,272 --> 00:02:33,853
I guess another significant thing.

73
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:35,956
It's our anniversary today.

74
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:37,549
- Yay.

75
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,960
- We were joking about our anniversary.

76
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,406
- It's actually our 10-year anniversary.

77
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,350
- Kind of a big deal.

78
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,183
- It is.

79
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:46,016
It's a huge deal,

80
00:02:46,016 --> 00:02:47,640
but we celebrated it by let's see,

81
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,661
you were up in the night with
somebody that peed their bed.

82
00:02:50,661 --> 00:02:51,794
- That was 3 a.m.

83
00:02:51,794 --> 00:02:54,018
- And I was up with her and then--

84
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,184
- At 4 a.m.

85
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:58,263
- There was like some
tantrums on the way to church.

86
00:02:58,263 --> 00:02:59,316
- Yeah.

87
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:01,945
- Anyway, there's family
in town which is super fun

88
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,526
and it was just a busy day regardless

89
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:04,921
and Laura's got a fever

90
00:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,052
so we're just really
not celebrating today.

91
00:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,934
It's an uneventful anniversary,
but we'll make up for it.

92
00:03:09,934 --> 00:03:11,759
We'll do something fun another time.

93
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,011
- We're planning sometime
this summer, we hope.

94
00:03:14,011 --> 00:03:16,260
- Hopefully, we would like
to do something bigger,

95
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,132
but really like this is real life.

96
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:19,040
- Yeah.

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,644
It's a little bit hard when
you have a baby who's nursing.

98
00:03:22,644 --> 00:03:25,955
To go somewhere far is kinda difficult.

99
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,831
- Right now we're just dreaming
of like going out to dinner,

100
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:30,766
so hopefully we can do that
sometime soon, but not today.

101
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:31,599
- It was funny though.

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,004
We have other friends who
have their anniversary today

103
00:03:34,004 --> 00:03:36,555
and one of 'em posted on
Facebook something like,

104
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,855
"It's been nine years of marriage

105
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:42,049
"and we still have never had a fight."

106
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:46,201
- And I think my response
was, "Oh, we can't post that."

107
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:47,495
- Then I was all technical.

108
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:50,541
I'm like, "Well, if we define
fight very differently,

109
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:55,255
"like a fight is like
shooting guns at each other,

110
00:03:55,255 --> 00:03:57,054
"we've never had a fight."

111
00:03:57,054 --> 00:03:58,171
- Oh, good.

112
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,004
Oh, good.

113
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,014
- Yeah.

114
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,182
- Earlier today, like this.

115
00:04:02,182 --> 00:04:04,871
Do you see that little like
kiss mark on Jeremy's face?

116
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,556
I was like, "What happened?

117
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:07,923
"Where'd you get that kiss from?"

118
00:04:07,923 --> 00:04:09,059
Have you seen Elise yet today?

119
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:09,892
- Yeah, yeah.

120
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,642
We showed 'em.

121
00:04:11,642 --> 00:04:13,392
Her lips are so cute.

122
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:16,144
- That's what we're up to.

123
00:04:16,144 --> 00:04:17,836
It's our 10th anniversary and she's sick

124
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:20,793
and we're hangin' with family.

125
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,495
- Have you guys seen this thing?

126
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,241
It is so fun.

127
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:28,004
So it's a big ball maze.

128
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,756
There's like a ball inside of it

129
00:04:30,756 --> 00:04:33,687
and you try to go through the maze.

130
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,515
(child screams)

131
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:37,175
That sounded like Caleb.

132
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,465
It's funny hearing my
mom's stories about me.

133
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:41,862
It sounds so much like Caleb.

134
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:42,712
Caleb.

135
00:04:42,712 --> 00:04:43,812
- We'll clean it up in a little while.

136
00:04:43,812 --> 00:04:44,942
- [Jeremy] What's goin' on?

137
00:04:44,942 --> 00:04:47,031
- He's just getting out, placing cups.

138
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:48,361
And Luke was trying to kind of clean up.

139
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:49,219
(singing)

140
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,052
- Uh oh.

141
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:50,885
Did Luke touch your--

142
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:51,962
- He's singing "Deck the Halls."

143
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:54,175
(singing)

144
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:55,427
He knows all the words.

145
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,559
- Don't do that.

146
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:59,070
- I'm just moving this.

147
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:02,506
- We think Caleb might be coming
down with a fever as well.

148
00:05:02,506 --> 00:05:05,377
Either that or he has
permanent crankiness.

149
00:05:05,377 --> 00:05:06,218
- Yeah.

150
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:07,060
But exciting.

151
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,003
We have a cake that we're doin'.

152
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,290
What kind of cake do we got goin' on?

153
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,613
- Lemon cake.

154
00:05:11,613 --> 00:05:12,446
- [Jeremy] Lemon?

155
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,548
Oh, yummy.

156
00:05:13,548 --> 00:05:15,474
- With lemon curd.

157
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:17,641
- [Jeremy] Lemon curd topping?

158
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:18,912
- With lemon curd in the middle

159
00:05:18,912 --> 00:05:20,071
and then it's a cream cheese frosting.

160
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:22,332
- It's like a lemon meringue cake?

161
00:05:22,332 --> 00:05:23,165
- Yes.

162
00:05:23,165 --> 00:05:25,662
- So, it's lemon jello
cake with lemon curd

163
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:29,134
and then lemon cream cheese frosting.

164
00:05:29,134 --> 00:05:29,975
I didn't make it.

165
00:05:29,975 --> 00:05:30,999
- Wow.

166
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:31,916
We're good.

167
00:05:33,165 --> 00:05:36,839
So this was our 10th anniversary special.

168
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,672
One take.

169
00:05:37,672 --> 00:05:38,505
- We made this for you.

170
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:39,338
- [Jeremy] Thanks, for our anniversary?

171
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,640
- For your 10-year anniversary.

172
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,656
- Very good.

173
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:42,847
So,

174
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:44,266
there we have it.

175
00:05:44,266 --> 00:05:45,375
- Happy anniversary.

176
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,390
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you want
to give us the J House out?

177
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,264
- I got nothin'.

178
00:05:49,264 --> 00:05:50,097
- [Jeremy] Nothin'?

179
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:50,930
- I got nothin'.

180
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,763
- [Jeremy] Caleb,

181
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:53,687
Isaac, do you want to
give us our J House out?

182
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:54,861
- J House out.
