00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:04,815
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)

2
00:00:08,077 --> 00:00:09,821
- Our four little kids
have been sick this week

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:13,868
and we decided to capture these
special memories in a song.

4
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:17,770
♫ On the sick days of Christmas,
my children gave to me

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,139
♫ 12 runs to the toilet

6
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:21,085
♫ Cleaned 11 chunks of vomit

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:23,291
♫ 10 hours of cartoons

8
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:25,287
♫ Nine-and-a-half Tylenol tablets

9
00:00:25,287 --> 00:00:27,100
♫ Eight loads of laundry

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,064
♫ Seven crackers for dinner

11
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:31,236
♫ Six extra baths

12
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:35,730
♫ Five farts that were
actually poo in their pants

13
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,131
♫ Four sick kids

14
00:00:37,131 --> 00:00:38,395
♫ Three throw-up bowls

15
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,008
♫ Two tired parents

16
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:44,175
♫ But one really really
stinkin' happy family

17
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:46,984
- Merry Christmas.

18
00:00:46,984 --> 00:00:48,059
- Merry Christmas!

19
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:50,589
- I hope your holidays have
been healthier than ours so far.

20
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:51,828
Goodnight!
- Night.

21
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:00,000
(cheerful music)
