1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,277
- [Jeremy] Gonna make a cake?

2
00:00:01,277 --> 00:00:02,110
- [Elise] Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:04,897
(upbeat, rhythmic music)

4
00:00:04,897 --> 00:00:07,230
- There's soap all over us!

5
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:11,674
- This is so yummy.

6
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:14,410
I'm having so much fun
tasting all the things!

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,320
So poor Janae has been really boogery.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,340
She has a cold and she's
just got lots of snot.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,260
So it's makin' it hard
for her to sleep and eat,

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,380
and when I was at the store yesterday

11
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,880
I picked up one of these things.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,560
It's called the Snot Sucker!

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,760
That's just a cool name,
but it's a weird device,

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,720
so we'll see how it works.

15
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,550
You literally put it in the kid's nose

16
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,100
and suck the snot out?

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,970
That sounds like a job
for Jeremy! (laughs)

18
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,570
- Not sponsored.
(Kendra laughs)

19
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:41,740
- Just a brave dad.

20
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,810
So the honest truth of it

21
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,870
is that I'm not brave
enough to try this thing,

22
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,300
but Jeremy is.

23
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,370
- I wanna suck boogers out of
my kid's nose. (Kendra laughs)

24
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,420
I'm gonna read the
instructions. (Janae squeals)

25
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,160
This is somethin' you
don't wanna get wrong.

26
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,877
- [Kendra] Yeah, what is that thing?

27
00:00:52,877 --> 00:00:54,060
(staggered blowing)
(Kendra laughs)

28
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,060
- So there's a filter

29
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,050
so no boogers will come
right into my mouth.

30
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,560
- [Kendra] Or is this the snot chamber

31
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,690
that fills up with snot?
- Yep.

32
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,180
Let's try this thing.

33
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,774
- [Kendra] Awe, I don't
know if she's gonna like it.

34
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:07,433
(Jeremy sucking)
(soft, playful music)

35
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,740
Did ya get anything?
- I dunno.

36
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,690
It's like a parent musical instrument.

37
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,480
She's not as bothered by it.

38
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,944
- [Kendra] Yeah, for sure.

39
00:01:14,944 --> 00:01:17,611
(Jeremy sucks)

40
00:01:20,496 --> 00:01:21,410
(Jeremy blows)

41
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,243
- [Kendra] Wow, she's way calmer.

42
00:01:22,243 --> 00:01:23,150
- She's smiling.

43
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,988
The thing goes all the
way up into her brain,

44
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:28,560
(Kendra laughs)
and then I suck out boogers.

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,393
- It's all traumatic.

46
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:30,410
Usually she's screaming,

47
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,130
but this she seems to
kinda like. (giggles)

48
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,091
Insert into the nasal cavity.
(Jeremy sucks)

49
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:36,490
Oop! (laughs)

50
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,690
All right I'm gonna call
this a huge success.

51
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:40,210
Janae seems to like it a lot better.

52
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,870
Usually she's screaming, and
we got a ton of snot out.

53
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,730
- The question is

54
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,530
is which parent first tried
this without the filter,

55
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:49,810
like, "I'm just gonna suck with a straw."

56
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,570
- So we've had five kids,
right, and Isaac is nine,

57
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,320
and some of the baby stuff that's out now

58
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
wasn't invented when he was a baby,

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
so we tend to just do what we know.

60
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,410
Like we've always used
these little devices.

61
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,110
This thing is actually really cool.

62
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:04,260
I guess we can teach
an old dog new tricks.

63
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,250
Are we old dogs now?

64
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,270
Is that what we are?

65
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,270
- [Jeremy] I guess so.

66
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,140
- [Kendra] How do ya
like that snot sucker?

67
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,849
(Janae breathes gently)
- Oh yeah.

68
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:14,080
So Janae came crawling over,
wanting to play with it more.

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,203
Here we go!
(Jeremy sucking)

70
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,784
(Jeremy laughs)
(Janae claps)

71
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,030
- Da da.
(Kendra laughs)

72
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,820
- That was the cutest thing ever.

73
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,750
- I know (laughs)

74
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,540
Poll question, would you be brave enough

75
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,780
to suck snot with the Snot Sucker?

76
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,030
- [Jeremy] Let's see that smile!

77
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,520
So what happened last night?

78
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,223
- I lost my tooth.

79
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,605
So I was brushing my teeth,

80
00:02:34,605 --> 00:02:37,983
and I noticed, "My tooth
is gone." (giggles)

81
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,200
Then, here it is.

82
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,290
- [Jeremy] So what's it like to eat?

83
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,060
- It's hard to explain it.

84
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,870
This morning, it was hard

85
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,460
'cause I wasn't really
experienced with eating.

86
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,130
I just went like this.
(Janae squealing)

87
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,151
[Jeremy] Like eat on the side.

88
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:51,984
- Yeah.

89
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:53,787
[Jeremy] We're having
leftovers for lunch today.

90
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:57,790
(upbeat, rhythmic music)

91
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,041
- [Jeremy] There's no teeth there.

92
00:02:59,041 --> 00:02:59,874
- I know!

93
00:02:59,874 --> 00:03:01,160
- [Jeremy] Do you want more, Nae Nae?

94
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,103
More grapes?

95
00:03:02,103 --> 00:03:03,320
- [Janae] Bla bla, blap.

96
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,153
- [Jeremy] Okay.

97
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:07,547
- So a hawk came, and it got some food.

98
00:03:07,547 --> 00:03:09,540
(lively guitar music)
(bird food spreading)

99
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,680
- [Jeremy] We have had so much
fun with the birds out here

100
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,300
that we just are spreading
out the birdseed all over,

101
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,110
so that birds can eat at more
than just the bird feeder.

102
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,960
- Oh look, look!

103
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,670
- [Jeremy] Birdy.

104
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,389
(Janae gurgles)

105
00:03:31,388 --> 00:03:34,555
(violin lesson music)

106
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,720
- Well this little girl is
sure getting adventurous.

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,350
I just was working on math
with Elise and all of a sudden,

108
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,750
I'm like, "Wait a minute, where is Janae?"

109
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,700
And we go running in and find
her playing in the toilet

110
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:50,533
in the bathroom!

111
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,210
What were you thinking?

112
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,743
(raspberry kissing)

113
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:55,980
So I get to have a few
moments just to myself today

114
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,340
and I'm really looking
forward to relaxing.

115
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,500
I'm going to take a hot bath
and use one of these things.

116
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,550
This a bath bomb, but it's
shaped like a cupcake,

117
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,810
which I think is super cute.

118
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:07,980
I got it from Bath and
Body Works. (sniffing)

119
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,790
And the smell is A Thousand Wishes.

120
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:10,984
It smells really good.

121
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,984
(relaxing flute music)
(bath water running)

122
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:27,947
(upbeat, pulsing music)

123
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:33,651
(hose spraying)

124
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:36,317
- [Jeremy] What's goin' on?

125
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,942
We're washin' our car.

126
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:40,275
- There's soap all over us!

127
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:08,660
- Well that was fun.

128
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,540
So Kendra's feeling a
little stressed today.

129
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,520
We thought we'd pick up something

130
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,300
that would bring her great joy.

131
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,550
(upbeat, bouncy music)

132
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,646
Thanks to you.

133
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:25,174
(Isaac burps)
What was that?

134
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,906
(kids laughing)
Gross!

135
00:05:27,906 --> 00:05:30,400
Say excuse me, ya sickos!

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,327
- [Isaac] Excuse me, you sickos.

137
00:05:32,327 --> 00:05:33,800
(all laugh)

138
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,974
- [Jeremy] These kids.

139
00:05:34,974 --> 00:05:38,141
(upbeat, jazzy music)

140
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,160
- [Jeremy] So Issac
picked the flavor for us.

141
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,480
What kind did you pick, Isaac?

142
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,610
- Strawberry and kiwi, it's really good.

143
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,010
- We're doing quiet time
right now for the kids.

144
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,280
- [Isaac] Let's put
the book shelf back up.

145
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,113
- [Elise] Yeah!

146
00:05:56,113 --> 00:05:57,428
- [Jeremy] Is this what
you're doin' for quiet time?

147
00:05:57,428 --> 00:05:58,780
- [Elise] Mm-hmm! (box flapping)

148
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,000
- [Jeremy] Makin' some more bracelets?

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,572
- Mm-hmm, there's a whole book.

150
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:03,460
(Janae gurgles)

151
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,597
- [Jeremy] Did you make her a bracelet?

152
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,430
- [Elise] Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,510
- [Jeremy] You did such
a good job makin' that.

154
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,780
I remember when you first got that toy

155
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,840
and you couldn't figure it out.

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,760
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,200
- [Jeremy] Now you make
'em all by yourself.

158
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,367
- Ah ah ah ah!

159
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,694
- [Jeremy] You like the stairs?

160
00:06:15,694 --> 00:06:18,830
(Janae gurgles)

161
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,880
- [Jeremy] Sit down.

162
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,383
This was one of your
birthday presents, huh?

163
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:22,216
- Mm-hmm.

164
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:23,049
- [Janea] Oh ya, ya ya.

165
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,040
- [Jeremy] I'm excited.

166
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,077
Gonna make a cake?

167
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:25,910
- [Elise] Mm-hmm.

168
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,743
- 'Kay, let's do it.

169
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:29,792
(melodic xylophone music)
- Hold that.

170
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:34,792
Here's the cake people.
(plastic crinkling)

171
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:35,732
Ooh oo!

172
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:38,490
- Whoa, that's cool!

173
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,655
- Look, these might be able to
hold the wings, right there.

174
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:43,689
- [Jeremy] Oh yeah!

175
00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:45,244
- [Janae] Ya ya ya ya ya.

176
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:46,730
- This is the cut-out thing.

177
00:06:49,285 --> 00:06:50,350
- [Jeremy] Is that all the cake mix?

178
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,315
- Yeah.
- The frosting

179
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:54,741
and the decorate.

180
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,090
(lively, jazzy music)

181
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,051
- [Jeremy] Is that the cake stand?

182
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,370
(Janae hollering)
- Mm-hmm.

183
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,540
I thought we did it
when the cake was there.

184
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,900
- [Jeremy] Insert doll!

185
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:07,270
Is it a twisty thing

186
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,268
or do you just stick it in?

187
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:10,159
(doll clicking)
Oh!

188
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:10,992
- There it go.

189
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:13,074
(Janae babbling)
(oven timer beeping)

190
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:13,950
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

191
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,848
All right, what's the next instruction?

192
00:07:15,848 --> 00:07:18,515
(can spraying)

193
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,592
- One.

194
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,352
Two.

195
00:07:26,583 --> 00:07:27,416
Mm-hmm!

196
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,483
- [Jeremy] Good job!

197
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,220
That's probably enough.

198
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:38,080
Then you give it a shake.
(Janae squealing)

199
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,303
(oven clicking shut)

200
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:50,386
(oven timer beeping)

201
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:55,969
(upbeat, rhythmic music)

202
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,549
- [Jeremy] Are those the pictures we took?

203
00:08:08,549 --> 00:08:10,062
- Mmm, at San Diego!

204
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:11,620
- [Jeremy] In San Diego.

205
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,270
So our photographer sent
us this cute little book

206
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,076
that has a bunch of the pictures we took.

207
00:08:16,076 --> 00:08:19,326
(bright, bouncy music)

208
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,825
- [Photographer] That is so cute!

209
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,230
Awe, so cute.

210
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,286
- [Assistant] Oops, the thing dropped.

211
00:08:24,286 --> 00:08:25,819
(photographers laugh)

212
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,810
- [Photographer] 'Kay, all right.

213
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,910
- [Jeremy] That was such a fun trip.

214
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,741
- [Laura] I wanna go there again soon.

215
00:08:33,741 --> 00:08:35,289
- [Jeremy] Yeah, that would be fun.

216
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,376
- I just got back from the gym.

217
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:37,329
- [Jeremy] How was it?

218
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:39,049
- It was a short workout, but
it was good. (Janae gurgles)

219
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,269
- [Jeremy] Someone missed ya.

220
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,750
- It was better than nothing.

221
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,490
Some days I really don't
wanna go to the gym.

222
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,760
Hi, baby. (kissing)

223
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,200
When I'm feeling (sighs) really anxious,

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
and depressed, and overwhelmed,

225
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
the last thing I wanna do is go work out,

226
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,990
but if I can just get myself to get there,

227
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,200
I always feel better afterwards.

228
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,570
So it was a short workout, I
didn't work out super hard.

229
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,800
It was just twenty, thirty minutes

230
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,410
of just on the elliptical,
but I feel better.

231
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,340
So looking at this
photo book from our trip

232
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,440
makes me really wanna work

233
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,940
on getting baby books for our kids.

234
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,010
We have all the pictures,

235
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,067
but I've never made them
into actual baby books.

236
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,631
(Janae whines)
So I wanna do that.

237
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,850
(upbeat, bouncy music)

238
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,290
So now we're mixing up the
fondant with some water.

239
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,430
We were concerned because it looked blue,

240
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,330
but with the water, it's
starting to look green.

241
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,163
- [Elise] Yeah.

242
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:20,700
- [Kendra] I don't see how
four teaspoons of water

243
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,270
is gonna be enough.
- Me neither.

244
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,380
- [Kendra] I think it
needs a little more water.

245
00:09:30,705 --> 00:09:31,538
- [Jeremy] Is that the fondant?

246
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:32,371
- [Elise] Mm-hmm.

247
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,204
- [Jeremy] It smells good.

248
00:09:33,204 --> 00:09:34,037
- Mm-hmm!

249
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:38,124
- So we're just cutting
off the very tops, okay?

250
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:38,957
- Okay.

251
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,826
- [Isaac] He is watching my computer.

252
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:42,994
- [Caleb] Play it.

253
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:44,597
- Smells good.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:45,583
- You wanna try to pop 'em out?

255
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:46,416
- Mm-hmm.
You wanna do it?

256
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:49,666
(upbeat, bouncy music)

257
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,725
(Kendra laughs)

258
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:54,680
- [Jeremy] Let's put fondant on it,

259
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,090
maybe that'll make it look better.

260
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,730
- We are gettin' creative.
- Yay!

261
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,740
- [Jeremy] Ya did it!

262
00:10:00,707 --> 00:10:01,540
(Kendra groans)

263
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,416
Once you cover it up with
fondant it'll just look perfect.

264
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,249
(oven timer beeping)

265
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,420
- [Kendra] Hopefully. (laughs)

266
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,850
- It looks easy, but it's
actually really hard.

267
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,483
- [Jeremy] We just
stick 'er in (chuckles).

268
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:18,436
- Is that the frosting?
(Kendra laughs)

269
00:10:18,436 --> 00:10:19,269
- [Jeremy] There we go.

270
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:20,769
- Oh there we go!

271
00:10:22,407 --> 00:10:23,602
- [Jeremy] It's like a tankini.

272
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:26,480
There's a top half the
person, and a bottom half.

273
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,192
- So what we can do, 'Lisey--

274
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,760
- Is put it in between.

275
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,860
- Yeah, like decorate it.

276
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,130
You can either roll it like a worm maybe?

277
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,920
'Lisey, that actually looks really cute!

278
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,910
I know it didn't turn out

279
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,620
just like we wanted it to, but look!

280
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,190
- Well at least it's gonna be yummy.

281
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,023
- Yeah.

282
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,290
- You guys we have
gymnastics in five minutes.

283
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:46,493
Get your clothes on for
gymnastics, come on!

284
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:49,743
(upbeat, bouncy music)

285
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,380
So because Kendra's gone,
we get done with gymnastics,

286
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,770
I'm tryin' to have the
kids eat real quick,

287
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,130
and then we gotta go to
violin and drop off Isaac.

288
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,694
Come on you guys, we gotta get in the car!

289
00:11:13,694 --> 00:11:14,527
(bread crunching)

290
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:15,538
All right, come on, hop back in the car.

291
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:16,371
(Caleb groans)

292
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:17,760
In the car everybody!

293
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,760
All right, let's go.
(van door sliding)

294
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,510
- So tonight I'm meeting
with my good friends

295
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,310
to plan our summer camp for this year,

296
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,760
and this is our sixth year
in a row doing summer camp!

297
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,460
We do it on just fun different topics

298
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,300
like Legos, or the five
senses, or the ocean.

299
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,870
And so we're meeting
to have dinner together

300
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,823
and chat about what the
plans for this year will be.

301
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:38,540
(clock ticking)

302
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,590
Success, we picked a theme for this year,

303
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,730
and I am really excited!

304
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,650
The activities, and the projects,

305
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,220
and the field trips,
it's gonna be awesome!

306
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,060
And now I just can't decide

307
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,580
if I should tell you
guys the theme or not.

308
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,450
Should I tell you?

309
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,640
Hmm, I'll just say it,

310
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,490
and then if Jeremy wants
to edit it out, he can.

311
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,600
Our theme for 2018 Summer Camp is space.

312
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,380
We're gonna do a space camp.

313
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,400
It is gonna be awesome!

314
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,990
Think galactic slime,
glow-in-the dark awesomeness,

315
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,480
going to an observatory, anti-gravity!

316
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,313
It's gonna be good!

317
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:07,190
We're finishing the night at
an awesome frozen yogurt spot.

318
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,400
They're having a great
sale, so we have to come.

319
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,170
'Kay, so these are my summer camp friends.

320
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,110
You guys remember them.

321
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,930
Anyway, we just saw a sign,
there's a cookie dough bar here!

322
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,650
I am so excited!

323
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,610
This is so yummy.

324
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm having so much fun
tasting all the things!

325
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
So I used this divider

326
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
and I got the cookie
dough and some yogurt.

327
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,600
(gentle, melodic music)

328
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
So here's my consensus
on the cookie dough,

329
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,620
I did like it with the yogurt,

330
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,500
but it's too rich all by itself,

331
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,340
and I really like rich stuff, so.

332
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,400
I did like it, but I think
it's better as maybe a topping.

333
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,070
- [Laura] Goodnight, J House out.

334
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,480
- I'm so glad that we vlog

335
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,948
to document important life
moments like this one right here.

336
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:48,691
(lively, rhythmic music)

337
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:49,524
- [Jeremy] More.

338
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:50,357
- [Kendra] More? (laughs)

339
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:51,690
- [Jeremy] More.

340
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,960
- [Kendra] Hi!

341
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,480
- [Jeremy] Did you move
all of these yourself?

342
00:12:56,480 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Isaac] Yep!
