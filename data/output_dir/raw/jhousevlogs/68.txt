1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,229
- [Kendra] That was quite the face.

2
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:03,413
- (giggles) Let's take down the tree.

3
00:00:03,413 --> 00:00:04,246
- [Kendra] What are you making?

4
00:00:04,246 --> 00:00:05,079
- Ice.

5
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:06,255
- [Kendra] You guys playing laser tag?

6
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:07,088
- Yes.

7
00:00:07,088 --> 00:00:08,630
(upbeat drum music)

8
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:11,101
- [Jeremy] Will it stay on
there if I just keep going?

9
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:11,934
(Kendra gasps)

10
00:00:11,934 --> 00:00:12,767
- [Kendra] Oh!

11
00:00:12,767 --> 00:00:14,769
(children shouting)

12
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:15,727
- I can see.

13
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:16,971
- [Jeremy] Look what came in the mail.

14
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:21,221
(peppy instrumental music)

15
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,054
(baby coos)

16
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:22,887
- [Kendra] You just walking around?

17
00:00:22,887 --> 00:00:24,063
These are the Christmas bins.

18
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:26,056
They're all full.

19
00:00:26,056 --> 00:00:29,327
(baby squealing)

20
00:00:29,327 --> 00:00:32,937
- [Kendra] Janae found
the Tupperware shelves.

21
00:00:32,937 --> 00:00:35,243
(giggling) I see you.

22
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,492
(baby babbling)

23
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:38,251
- [Kendra] Hi, are you saying hi?

24
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,467
(baby squealing)

25
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:41,717
(thudding)

26
00:00:45,608 --> 00:00:46,441
(whooshing)

27
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:48,586
- Well, so far our day has
been a little bit of a bummer.

28
00:00:48,586 --> 00:00:51,126
We had some fun plans,
but we've had to cancel

29
00:00:51,126 --> 00:00:53,114
because Jeremy has run
into a bunch of problems

30
00:00:53,114 --> 00:00:54,012
with work this morning.

31
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,185
It's just been lots of
technical difficulties

32
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,118
and issues coming up, and
our plans were to go out

33
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,568
and do something fun with him today.

34
00:00:59,568 --> 00:01:01,320
So, we're going to save
that for another day

35
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,538
and instead I called some
friends and they're coming over

36
00:01:03,538 --> 00:01:06,405
to play with our kids, and
I'm cleaning up Christmas.

37
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:07,585
I think by the end of today,

38
00:01:07,585 --> 00:01:09,418
Christmas is gonna be all boxed up

39
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:12,428
and we're going to try to take
the tree down, which is sad.

40
00:01:12,428 --> 00:01:16,136
And also exciting to get
the house cleaned and ready

41
00:01:16,136 --> 00:01:17,083
for the new year.

42
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:19,179
Who's coming over to play?

43
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:20,491
- (whispering) Brittany.

44
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:22,483
- [Kendra] Your friend
Brittany's coming over to play?

45
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:23,316
Well, that's going to be fun.

46
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,398
You better go watch the
door, see if she's coming.

47
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:28,565
(upbeat guitar music)

48
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:33,417
- So, the kids have some friends over

49
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:35,778
and they're having so
much fun playing together.

50
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:39,445
(upbeat instrumental music)

51
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:41,516
- [Kendra] What are you guys doing?

52
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:42,742
- We are eating.

53
00:01:42,742 --> 00:01:44,382
- [Kendra] Is this your baby?

54
00:01:44,382 --> 00:01:46,529
- [Girl With Teal Shirt] Yes,
do you got the new baby now?

55
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:48,471
- [Kendra] So, are you guys
gonna have some birthday cake?

56
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:51,053
- Yeah, yes it's my birthday.

57
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,195
- [Kendra] Ooh, very fun.

58
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,458
- Mom, where's my food?

59
00:01:54,458 --> 00:01:55,389
- [Kendra] What are you making?

60
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:56,808
- Ice.

61
00:01:56,808 --> 00:01:57,900
- [Kendra] Where does it go?

62
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,733
- In here.

63
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,478
I want to bake you something.

64
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:02,561
I want to have breakfast.

65
00:02:04,807 --> 00:02:07,557
(knobs clicking)

66
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:11,756
(slurping)

67
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,673
- [Kendra] Hey Nae Nae.

68
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:17,312
(baby squealing)

69
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:18,389
(synthesizer music)

70
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:19,576
- [Kendra] You guys playing laser tag?

71
00:02:19,576 --> 00:02:20,409
- Yes.

72
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,680
(synthesizer music)

73
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,347
(guns clicking)

74
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:34,479
- [Kendra] Lunch today
is a ginormous salad,

75
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,605
gettin' ready for the new
year and eating healthy.

76
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,855
(clicking)

77
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:46,333
(boys laughing)

78
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,353
- [Kendra] This game is super fun.

79
00:02:48,353 --> 00:02:50,460
(clicking)

80
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,293
- Hi.

81
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:53,277
(girls laughing)

82
00:02:53,277 --> 00:02:54,254
- [Kendra] What are you guys playing?

83
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:55,625
- Exploding kittens.

84
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,222
- [Kendra] Awesome.

85
00:02:57,222 --> 00:02:58,467
Everybody look.

86
00:02:58,467 --> 00:03:00,070
(children laughing)

87
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,483
- All of these are so funny.

88
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,316
- I don't--

89
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,066
(Kendra gasping)
(children chattering)

90
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:07,887
- [Kendra] Aubrey put down a
note, you gotta put it back.

91
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,224
They're teaming up now.

92
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:11,294
It's gettin' real.

93
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:14,448
Uh oh, Elise is attacking Caleb!

94
00:03:14,448 --> 00:03:16,320
[Boy In White Shirt] Caleb,
you have to draw some cards.

95
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,439
(boy yells)

96
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,122
[Laura] You have two notes.

97
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:24,289
♪ I cry the day that
I take the tree down ♪

98
00:03:26,451 --> 00:03:30,618
♪ I want the season to
last all year round ♪

99
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,172
Do you guys know that song?

100
00:03:35,172 --> 00:03:36,971
I think of that song every year

101
00:03:36,971 --> 00:03:39,146
when we take down the Christmas tree.

102
00:03:39,146 --> 00:03:41,029
Sorry, I'm definitely not a singer,

103
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:42,981
but it's in my head,
so it had to come out.

104
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:45,656
Jeremy has a minute to step away from work

105
00:03:45,656 --> 00:03:48,361
and so he's going to
help me get this beast

106
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:51,459
out of our house, and then
I'm going to vacuum for days.

107
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:54,641
Do you guys see all
those things everywhere?

108
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:57,182
This is the one moment when I usually wish

109
00:03:57,182 --> 00:03:58,630
that we had an artificial tree.

110
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,679
Like, it would be a lot easier
to take down and put away,

111
00:04:01,679 --> 00:04:03,532
but I do still love having a real tree.

112
00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:04,944
Jeremy and I were chatting
and I think next year

113
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,287
we'd actually love to get a real tree

114
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,420
that actually is like in root,
so it's an alive real tree.

115
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,263
And then we could just
plant it in our backyard,

116
00:04:11,263 --> 00:04:12,426
which would be awesome.

117
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:13,758
That was quite the face.

118
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,489
- (giggles) Let's take down the tree.

119
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:17,851
So, I will be doing this in my pajamas

120
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,690
even though it's three
o'clock in the afternoon.

121
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,989
(Kendra laughing)

122
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,812
I had some like work problems,

123
00:04:24,812 --> 00:04:26,532
technical problems with my computer.

124
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,683
- [Kendra] You guys stabilizing the tree?

125
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:31,143
I've gotta unscrew it down here.

126
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:34,985
(happy guitar music)

127
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:38,286
(upbeat drumming)

128
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:40,768
- So, there's a park nearby
that recycles the trees

129
00:04:40,768 --> 00:04:42,768
and so we're going to take
it there to drop it off.

130
00:04:42,768 --> 00:04:44,684
- [Kendra] There he goes.

131
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,372
The man and the tree.

132
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:47,663
Bye.
- I'm on it.

133
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,149
- [Kendra] Are you gonna tie
it to the top of the roof?

134
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:50,750
- Yeah.

135
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,092
- That is a really big tree.

136
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,088
(upbeat instrumental music)

137
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,921
(vacuum whirring)

138
00:05:05,604 --> 00:05:06,905
- The Christmas tree!

139
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:08,345
- [Jeremy] It started falling off.

140
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:10,635
Okay, I better try to fix it.

141
00:05:10,635 --> 00:05:12,339
(Jeremy laughing)

142
00:05:12,339 --> 00:05:15,746
Oh, will it stay on there
if I just keep going.

143
00:05:15,746 --> 00:05:18,913
(jaunty guitar music)

144
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:35,328
- So, Jeremy and I finally
just put on clothes.

145
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,637
- 'Cause I'm about to go to the store.

146
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,530
- We're matching.

147
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,583
We didn't know that, we didn't mean to,

148
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,108
but we're both wearing
our Studio C attire.

149
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,691
- Which as a side note, Kendra has become

150
00:05:45,691 --> 00:05:48,265
a little bit of a Studio
C binge-watcher lately.

151
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:49,098
It's her current--

152
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,380
- I have it too!
- That's hilarious.

153
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,361
Are you wearing a Studio C shirt too?

154
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:53,341
- Yeah!
(Jeremy laughing)

155
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:55,134
- [Kendra] Our cousins are here.

156
00:05:55,134 --> 00:05:57,129
Luke and Allie.
(children talking)

157
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,630
- Well, Jeremy is heading
out to get some dinner for us

158
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,897
and I'm going to stay
here with this crazy crew.

159
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:05,064
(upbeat guitar music)

160
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:13,105
- We're going shopping.

161
00:06:13,105 --> 00:06:14,861
- [Jeremy] We're going shopping.

162
00:06:14,861 --> 00:06:16,476
(singing)

163
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,555
- Yes!

164
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:18,978
- [Jeremy] You've been singing so much.

165
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,656
Do you want to help me
get some flowers for mom?

166
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:21,739
- Yeah, yeah.

167
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,092
- [Jeremy] Okay, put 'em in the cart.

168
00:06:28,424 --> 00:06:30,370
(jaunty organ music)

169
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,328
How did you enjoy being my little helper?

170
00:06:32,328 --> 00:06:33,161
- Great.

171
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,615
- [Jeremy] I just love
being with you, big girl.

172
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,112
Look what came in the mail.

173
00:06:36,112 --> 00:06:38,205
- I'm guessing my new glasses.

174
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:39,876
- [Jeremy] Well, put them on, let's see.

175
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:43,930
I'm so glad that you don't
have broken glasses anymore.

176
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,365
- Just for safety.

177
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:47,214
- [Jeremy] Alright.

178
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:48,707
- [Isaac] Does it look normal?

179
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:49,985
