1
00:00:00,235 --> 00:00:02,270
- [Kendra] You guys want to see what came?

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,660
It's all your Halloween costumes.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,743
- [All] Yeah!

4
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:07,163
(lively electronic music)

5
00:00:07,163 --> 00:00:08,354
(Jeremy laughs)

6
00:00:08,354 --> 00:00:10,354
(yells)

7
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:15,464
(funky electronic music)

8
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:17,194
- [Jeremy] Thanks for being a hard-worker.

9
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:18,286
- Can you help me?

10
00:00:18,286 --> 00:00:21,703
- [Jeremy] Yeah, of course I'll help you.

11
00:00:23,465 --> 00:00:24,632
- That's mine.

12
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,172
This one's mine.

13
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:30,339
(gentle guitar music)

14
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:35,954
(cascading toys)

15
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:37,871
- She loves those toys.

16
00:00:42,705 --> 00:00:45,258
- This morning, we're doing a
fun family project together.

17
00:00:45,258 --> 00:00:48,698
Jeremy and the kids are
going to build a website.

18
00:00:48,698 --> 00:00:50,412
- We're going to make our own website?

19
00:00:50,412 --> 00:00:55,001
- What do you guys think about
us having our own website?

20
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,809
- Could people go to it?

21
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:57,642
- Yeah for sure.

22
00:00:57,642 --> 00:00:59,287
People who watch our
videos could go there.

23
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:02,557
It's gonna be at Jhousevlogs.com.

24
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:04,375
- So with Jeremy and his
brother Brent having recently

25
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,319
started a law firm together,

26
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,296
they needed a website,

27
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:08,112
and so they looked around at
all these different options

28
00:01:08,112 --> 00:01:09,786
and they decide to use Wix.

29
00:01:09,786 --> 00:01:11,698
Then Wix shouted out to
us to sponsor this video

30
00:01:11,698 --> 00:01:14,274
so that we could build our
own J House Vlogs website.

31
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,430
And we were so excited about it,

32
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,813
because we had already used this process.

33
00:01:17,813 --> 00:01:19,781
And it was super user friendly and easy.

34
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:21,453
- I'm literally so excited.

35
00:01:21,453 --> 00:01:23,133
- Welcome to Wix.

36
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,093
- Alright so this is the editor.

37
00:01:25,093 --> 00:01:27,672
Okay, so we found the
template that we want to use.

38
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:29,271
Now Isaac, do you want to
help me with the next part?

39
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,104
- Yeah.

40
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:34,440
- [Jeremy] You can make
it say J House Vlogs.

41
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,700
And you hit apply.

42
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,175
- Apply, hey this is easy.

43
00:01:39,175 --> 00:01:42,448
- so we want to have Janae, replace image.

44
00:01:42,448 --> 00:01:43,281
- Yep.

45
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:45,161
So we just changed the image they had

46
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,736
with one from our Instagram feed.

47
00:01:46,736 --> 00:01:48,799
- Now let's go back.

48
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:49,842
- There it is.

49
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:52,414
Alright, should we do
that to the next one?

50
00:01:52,414 --> 00:01:53,247
- I'm gonna get this one.

51
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,934
- Oh the sassy pants one of Mom?

52
00:01:54,934 --> 00:01:55,767
- Uh-huh.

53
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:57,478
- [Kendra] Uh-oh, there's a
sassy pants one of me on there?

54
00:01:57,478 --> 00:01:59,074
- [Jeremy] You have like
food all over your shirt.

55
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:00,126
- [Elise] No poop.

56
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:01,268
- Oh is that poop?
- No I have poop.

57
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:02,101
(Jeremy laughs)

58
00:02:02,101 --> 00:02:04,094
- [Jeremy] Let's do the one
with poop on Mom's shirt, okay?

59
00:02:04,094 --> 00:02:05,026
Hit apply.
- Family friendly.

60
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:05,859
- It's on there.

61
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:06,985
(laughing)

62
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:07,954
Alright number eight.

63
00:02:07,954 --> 00:02:09,173
- So we're showing this
to the kids right now

64
00:02:09,173 --> 00:02:10,161
and letting them help,

65
00:02:10,161 --> 00:02:12,169
but I honestly can't wait
to get my hands on it

66
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:13,633
and have some fun.

67
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,481
I think I could play on
this thing for hours.

68
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:16,537
- Yeah.

69
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:17,948
Get in here buddy.

70
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,613
- [Kendra] Yeah, click right there Cubby.

71
00:02:19,613 --> 00:02:20,460
- [Jeremy] Now we can see
what it would look like

72
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,377
on a phone.

73
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:24,368
Oh right here?

74
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:27,193
- Yeah, show that.
- Okay watch this.

75
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:28,046
- [Isaac] What?

76
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,604
- Now if you click on that link

77
00:02:30,604 --> 00:02:34,779
it goes to J House Vlogs.
- And now we're in.

78
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:35,612
- What?

79
00:02:35,612 --> 00:02:36,854
- Now there's an easier way

80
00:02:36,854 --> 00:02:38,950
to get to J House Vlogs.

81
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,891
- [Kendra] So now I think
you can drag it Elise,

82
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,117
to where you want to put it.

83
00:02:42,117 --> 00:02:43,790
- Let's try putting it up over here.

84
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,428
There you go, you're shrinking it.

85
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:46,427
- Who added that on?

86
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,972
- The J House?

87
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:49,413
That was Elise.

88
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:51,395
- Great job, I like it.

89
00:02:51,395 --> 00:02:52,228
(gasps)

90
00:02:52,228 --> 00:02:53,520
- [Jeremy] It did it.

91
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,964
It just pulled up all
of our YouTube videos.

92
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,446
All I had to do was enter in our username.

93
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,446
- So Laura was gone at a
play date this morning,

94
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,108
and now Elise is gonna
show her what we made

95
00:03:03,108 --> 00:03:04,092
while she was gone.

96
00:03:04,092 --> 00:03:05,377
- We made a website.

97
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:06,259
(gasps)

98
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:08,601
- Janae just took a long nap.

99
00:03:08,601 --> 00:03:11,839
- [Jeremy] Do you want to see our website.

100
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,766
(laughing)

101
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:15,543
(blowing raspberries)

102
00:03:15,543 --> 00:03:16,766
That's what she things of that.

103
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:19,686
(Jeremy laughs)

104
00:03:19,686 --> 00:03:21,160
- [Jeremy] Which one do you want to watch?

105
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,326
- It has everything single one?

106
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:24,968
- It has everything.
- What?

107
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,733
- [Jeremy] Let's do this one.

108
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:27,650
Watch this.

109
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,725
(laughs)

110
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:35,490
(accelerating music)

111
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,794
- We'd like to thank Wix
for reaching out to us

112
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:37,747
and sponsoring this video today.

113
00:03:37,747 --> 00:03:40,067
It was really fun to create
this website as a family.

114
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,859
We're excited to continue working on it

115
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:42,692
and show it to all of you.

116
00:03:42,692 --> 00:03:43,916
- So we put the link
in the description box

117
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,867
to Wix.com, so you can
build your own website.

118
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:49,427
You can also go to jhousevlogs.com,

119
00:03:49,427 --> 00:03:51,318
to see what we made.

120
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:54,485
(lively guitar music)

121
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,097
- Ow ma ma ma.

122
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:01,752
- Hi hi.

123
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,833
(baby babbling)

124
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,903
- Good job, oh.
(blowing raspberries)

125
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:13,153
(laughing)

126
00:04:14,292 --> 00:04:16,397
- [Kendra] Lunch today is leftovers.

127
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:18,165
- [Caleb] But it's still good.

128
00:04:18,165 --> 00:04:18,998
- This is my life.

129
00:04:18,998 --> 00:04:20,014
I'm nursing Janae.

130
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:21,661
I was reading a book to Laura.

131
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm correcting Caleb's reading work.

132
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,248
Isaac comes in to tell me
about a new sport he invented.

133
00:04:26,248 --> 00:04:29,423
And Elise came in to
tell me all about a show.

134
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:33,022
- Welcome to motherhood
with five children.

135
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,469
- [Kendra] So Elise just
sat down with her notebook

136
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:37,206
and the little sequins are making

137
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:39,797
this pretty pattern everywhere.

138
00:04:39,797 --> 00:04:40,630
- Whoa.

139
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:42,591
- Dude.

140
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:44,116
- [Kendra] Isaac look.

141
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,446
(laughing)

142
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:48,602
- From the sun, it's making it bright.

143
00:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,144
- Get it.

144
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:50,977
Get it.

145
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:52,806
(yelling)

146
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:53,639
Get it.

147
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,058
(yelling)

148
00:04:58,058 --> 00:04:59,017
(laughing)

149
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,842
- So now that the kids have
discovered this lighting effect,

150
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,657
they want to put on a show.

151
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:03,897
Laura is being Elsa

152
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,615
and Elise, are you Cinderella?

153
00:05:05,615 --> 00:05:06,448
- [Elise] Yes.

154
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:09,247
- I have to do my make-up, just pretend.

155
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,096
- [Jeremy] She's got to do her make-up.

156
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:12,214
- Yeah, but then I'll come back,

157
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:14,295
but don't start it, okay?

158
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:17,878
(elegant orchestral music)

159
00:05:22,308 --> 00:05:24,108
- [Jeremy] She's ready (laughs).

160
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,608
- Presenting Elsa!

161
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:28,682
- [Jeremy] Yay!

162
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:31,273
(cheering)

163
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:32,272
- Dun dun dun,

164
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,694
♫ It's funny how some distance

165
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:38,105
♫ Make everything seem small

166
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,259
♫ And the fears that

167
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:41,579
- What is this?

168
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,603
- A ring.

169
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:45,918
- Do you want me to get married to you?

170
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:47,496
Yes.

171
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:48,743
- You love me.

172
00:05:48,743 --> 00:05:52,326
- And we're so happy
to be with each other.

173
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:56,256
(laughing)

174
00:05:57,115 --> 00:05:58,528
- Uh-ma.

175
00:05:58,528 --> 00:06:00,396
(Jeremy laughs)

176
00:06:00,396 --> 00:06:01,442
- Uh-ma.

177
00:06:01,442 --> 00:06:04,239
(laughing)

178
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,406
- She's so cute with that.

179
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:08,708
- Ah-Ya.

180
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:10,958
(laughing)

181
00:06:11,828 --> 00:06:13,208
- Ma.

182
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,458
(laughing)

183
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:20,027
- So I just checked the
mail and we got a box.

184
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:21,091
And I'm excited about it,

185
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:22,994
because what's inside the
box, here I'll show you,

186
00:06:22,994 --> 00:06:24,601
is our Halloween costumes.

187
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:25,712
I let the kids each choose

188
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:26,978
what they wanted to be.

189
00:06:26,978 --> 00:06:28,773
Alright, do you guys
want to see what came?

190
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:30,243
It's all your Halloween costumes.

191
00:06:30,243 --> 00:06:31,326
- [All] Yeah!

192
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:34,224
- Here you go Isaac.

193
00:06:34,224 --> 00:06:35,801
(laughing)

194
00:06:35,801 --> 00:06:37,269
- Yeah!

195
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:38,102
(roars)

196
00:06:38,102 --> 00:06:38,935
- Caleb.

197
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:41,639
- Oh my tie.

198
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,414
- [Kendra] Laura.

199
00:06:43,414 --> 00:06:44,751
(squeals)

200
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:46,013
- [Kendra] Lise.

201
00:06:46,013 --> 00:06:47,367
- Yes!

202
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,609
- How does it work?

203
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,228
- I don't know we're gonna
have to figure it out.

204
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:51,857
What's the necklace's name?

205
00:06:51,857 --> 00:06:53,013
- The Heart of Te Fiti.

206
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,386
- Is it the Heart of Te Fiti?

207
00:06:54,386 --> 00:06:55,849
(bright music)

208
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,505
- Whoa.

209
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:59,036
- [Kendra] Is that fun?

210
00:06:59,036 --> 00:06:59,869
- Yeah.

211
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:04,668
- Woo.

212
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:05,899
(laughing)

213
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:06,732
- Woo.

214
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:08,996
It's so pretty.

215
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,123
Moana.

216
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:16,972
- Who are you gonna be?

217
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:17,853
- Harry Potter.

218
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,305
- Okay, ready?

219
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,457
Let's see if we got the right robe.

220
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:22,290
- I like it.

221
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,123
- On real Halloween,

222
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:24,891
you're gonna have your
white shirt underneath.

223
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,923
(enchanting music)

224
00:07:27,923 --> 00:07:28,756
- I like it.

225
00:07:28,756 --> 00:07:29,589
- Wait, I know what we need

226
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:30,422
to complete the outfit.

227
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:32,016
Stand in front of the mirror.

228
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:33,052
- So this will go on

229
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,016
and then we just pull it up.

230
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:37,099
Looking good.

231
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:40,922
(funky beat music)

232
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:45,685
So Elise had been a
princess every year before,

233
00:07:45,685 --> 00:07:47,812
but this year she wanted
to do something different.

234
00:07:47,812 --> 00:07:50,810
- Yeah, I kind of felt
not princess-y anymore.

235
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:53,059
- Elise told me she wanted
to be something strong

236
00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:55,058
for Halloween, because it
represents her personality

237
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,266
better, because she's strong.

238
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,515
What do you think, go look in the mirror.

239
00:07:58,515 --> 00:08:00,626
- [Jeremy] You look so good.

240
00:08:00,626 --> 00:08:01,912
- I think when my hair's down,

241
00:08:01,912 --> 00:08:04,220
it'll look better.

242
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,053
- [Kendra] Okay Elise,
we got to take it off.

243
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:06,951
- Ah I don't want to take it off.

244
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,648
- [Jeremy] It's fun, huh.

245
00:08:08,648 --> 00:08:09,481
- Yeah.

246
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:10,314
- Halloween will come soon enough.

247
00:08:10,314 --> 00:08:12,097
So I think I'm the most
nervous about Isaac's costume.

248
00:08:12,097 --> 00:08:13,001
I really hope it fits.

249
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,705
The reviews were all over the place,

250
00:08:14,705 --> 00:08:15,538
so we'll try it on him.

251
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:16,371
- I'm excited for this.

252
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,112
- [Jeremy] You should be,
your costume is hilarious.

253
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:20,406
- It was a great choice.

254
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:22,628
If your costume comes with a battery pack,

255
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:25,142
you're doing something right.

256
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:26,584
- [Jeremy] I'm excited.

257
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:27,725
- [Kendra] Load it up.

258
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:31,058
- [Jeremy] Someone found something cool.

259
00:08:33,205 --> 00:08:35,476
(boing)

260
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:36,546
That was a good one.

261
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,030
- [Kendra] That was a good one.

262
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,765
(boing)

263
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,003
(Jeremy laughs)

264
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,206
- [Jeremy] Nice.

265
00:08:42,206 --> 00:08:43,039
Good job.

266
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,981
So before we can blow this up,

267
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:50,148
Isaac has to climb inside.

268
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,736
Let's see if this one's the right size.

269
00:08:54,736 --> 00:08:57,403
(playful music)

270
00:08:58,493 --> 00:08:59,326
It works.

271
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:05,069
(laughing)

272
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:06,652
- Where did you go?

273
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:11,996
Your head's supposed to
come through here somehow.

274
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,226
- [Jeremy] There we go.

275
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:14,226
There he is.

276
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:19,741
There we go.

277
00:09:21,225 --> 00:09:24,558
- This is like maybe Laura could fit in.

278
00:09:27,741 --> 00:09:30,523
- [Jeremy] (laughs) It
does just barely peek out.

279
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:31,848
Let's just make sure
his nose and his mouth

280
00:09:31,848 --> 00:09:33,897
can come through, so he can breathe.

281
00:09:33,897 --> 00:09:36,422
- [Isaac] Oh there, that's good.

282
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,005
- Think you can get

283
00:09:40,254 --> 00:09:41,087
Okay, just a second,

284
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:44,217
we gotta figure out the head spot.

285
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,401
Okay just a second Isaac.

286
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,151
Hold your head still.

287
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:53,836
(laughing)

288
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:57,370
- [Jeremy] Yay, we figured it out.

289
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,159
- We figured it out.

290
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:01,409
(laughing)

291
00:10:14,236 --> 00:10:15,454
The dancing dinosaur.

292
00:10:15,454 --> 00:10:16,465
- [Jeremy] Alright, I
think we have the Halloween

293
00:10:16,465 --> 00:10:18,175
costumes figured out.

294
00:10:18,175 --> 00:10:19,281
- Yeah!

295
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:20,880
- I made the Halloween
decisions early this year,

296
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,296
so that I wouldn't have to
stress for the whole month.

297
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:24,572
But what I didn't realize is that now

298
00:10:24,572 --> 00:10:25,514
that the decisions are made

299
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:26,347
and we've tried them on

300
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:27,345
and the kids are all excited about them,

301
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,562
now I get to look forward
to Halloween for a month.

302
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,369
So instead of dreading it for a month

303
00:10:31,369 --> 00:10:32,202
and being stressed about it,

304
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:33,418
I get to look forward to it.

305
00:10:33,418 --> 00:10:36,265
Like I need to be more decisive like this.

306
00:10:36,265 --> 00:10:38,402
(beat boxing)

307
00:10:38,402 --> 00:10:40,731
♫ The moon is up, it's getting late,

308
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,965
♫ Let's get ready to celebrate

309
00:10:42,965 --> 00:10:45,189

(sped up rapping)

315
00:10:54,115 --> 00:10:55,054
♫ It might be stripey or polka dotty

316
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,093
♫ We can all pajama in whatever we gotty

317
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,178
♫ Pajama to the left, pajama to the right

318
00:10:58,178 --> 00:10:59,748

00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,514
♫ Everybody's wearing

320
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,196
♫ J-j-j Jama jama PJ

321
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,770
♫ Now all around the room

322
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,522
♫ And we'll be glad, wearing
our pajamas and looking so fine

323
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:07,997
♫ It's pajama time

324
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:09,746
♫ Hush hush, it's pajama time

325
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,887
♫ Hush hush, it's pajama time

326
00:11:11,887 --> 00:11:15,555
♫ Shhh, goodnight, sleep tight

327
00:11:15,555 --> 00:11:17,351
(laughing)

328
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,159
- You didn't read it so well.

329
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:21,350
- So this was the favorite book

330
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,602
Did she say I didn't read it so well?

331
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:24,030
- [Kendra] Yeah.

332
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,149
- (laughs) I screwed it up.

333
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:28,525
This was Isaac's favorite book.

334
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,451
And so I read it with him,

335
00:11:30,451 --> 00:11:33,004
and I then I did it with
Elise and Caleb and Laura.

336
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,763
And now, that was my first time

337
00:11:34,763 --> 00:11:36,627
to ever read it to Janae Nae.

338
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:38,793
- Read it again.

339
00:11:38,793 --> 00:11:40,344
(beat boxing)

340
00:11:40,344 --> 00:11:42,021
- [Kendra] And you said it
was Isaac's favorite book?

341
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:43,351
Or was it our favorite book?

342
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:45,062
♫ It's gettin' late

343
00:11:45,062 --> 00:11:46,394
♫ Let's get ready to celebrate

344
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:47,756
♫ It's pajama t-t-time

345
00:11:47,756 --> 00:11:49,028
- Good night, J House out.

346
00:11:49,028 --> 00:11:50,841
- You're going to Hogwarts.

347
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,579
Gryffindor!

348
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:53,412
(sewing machine whirring)

349
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,352
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

350
00:11:55,352 --> 00:11:57,169
- [Kendra] Hi.

351
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,985
- This is so weird.

352
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:00,049
- I didn't make it to Hogwarts.

353
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:00,882
- [Kendra] You didn't make it?

354
00:12:00,882 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yeah.
