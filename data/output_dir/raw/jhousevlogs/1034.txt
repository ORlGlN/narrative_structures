1
00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:01,323
(children singing)

2
00:00:01,323 --> 00:00:03,220
♫ Laura, you

3
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,819
♫ Are so stinky and cute

4
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:09,912
♫ I love you so, Laura

5
00:00:09,912 --> 00:00:12,110
♫ You're so beautiful

6
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:13,605
♫ Whooo

7
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:16,272
(Caleb singing)

8
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:20,662
(light playful music)

9
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:46,091
- [Kendra] 'Cause you put
those in the washing machine.

10
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,924
- Oh.

11
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:48,775
- And then Daddy made the fatal error of

12
00:00:48,775 --> 00:00:50,579
putting stuff in the washing
machine and starting it

13
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,771
without checking it first.

14
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,712
- And, what is in here?

15
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:59,316
- It's a bunch of pieces
of paper that got washed.

16
00:00:59,316 --> 00:01:03,361
Anyway, moral of the story:
if you have a toddler and

17
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:07,528
a front-loading machine, always
check the washing machine

18
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:11,486
before running a load of something.

19
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,444
(children shouting)
- Good job, good job.

20
00:01:13,444 --> 00:01:14,277
- Kick, kick, kick.

21
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:15,110
Go, Elise.

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,222
Go, Joshua.

23
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:18,309
Go, Kaylee.

24
00:01:18,309 --> 00:01:21,032
Good job, yay!

25
00:01:21,032 --> 00:01:24,782
(boy screaming and clapping)

26
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:29,184
- [Jeremy] On three,
we're gonna do 'Thunder'.

27
00:01:29,184 --> 00:01:31,934
- [All] One, two, three, Thunder.

28
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:34,777
- Alright, good job, you guys.

29
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:38,944
(overlapping chatter,
children screaming, clapping)

30
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,034
Good job, big girl.

31
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:45,573
Can I get a hug?

32
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,490
I love you.

33
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:48,925
- Wait, I need a picture.

34
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:50,931
- Picture.

35
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:52,534
Thought that this would
be good for our kids

36
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:55,567
to look back on the vlog and
hear more about our story

37
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:59,133
of how we met, how we fell in love--

38
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:00,813
- Awwww.
- And all of that stuff.

39
00:02:00,813 --> 00:02:02,096
(Jeremy laughs)

40
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:05,141
- So, we wanted to give
another story from our past.

41
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:07,836
- Our apartment complex held
a dance the last weekend

42
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:11,121
of May, on a Saturday night,
and we were both there.

43
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:14,175
And Jeremy is a mighty fine dancer.

44
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,868
- Well I mean, they've seen
these moves already on the vlog.

45
00:02:18,868 --> 00:02:22,201
(classical opera music)

46
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:27,534
- Anyway, so he definitely
caught my eye at the dance.

47
00:02:27,534 --> 00:02:30,284
- Kendra, she had these pants on,

48
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:32,987
she looked really good.

49
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:33,870
It was really, she was really--

50
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,550
- Guys, I was wearing pants
and that's what it takes.

51
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,525
I looked incredible.

52
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,659
- She looked really good.

53
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,173
Like, I remember the
outfit she was wearing

54
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,635
so she just looked really cute.

55
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:46,931
- Oh, so he asked me to
dance, but only one dance

56
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:49,278
and I remember kind of
feeling jibbed about that.

57
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,711
- Like, come on.
- It was very intentional.

58
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:53,750
- You should dance with me more.

59
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,585
He was, not in like a player
way at all, but just in a

60
00:02:56,585 --> 00:03:00,546
super-friendly way, he was
dancing with everybody and

61
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:02,849
so I kind of was bummed.

62
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,517
I kind of wanted some special treatment.

63
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,000
I mean, come on.

64
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,848
Like, notice me.

65
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,999
- If I would have noticed
her and given her the special

66
00:03:09,999 --> 00:03:12,635
treatment, she would not have
paid attention to me, so.

67
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:14,172
- You know how it goes.
- Anyway.

68
00:03:14,172 --> 00:03:16,702
- The dance had ended at
midnight and we were about ready

69
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:17,869
to part to go our separate ways.

70
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:18,799
Jeremy lived on the third floor

71
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,600
and I lived on the first floor
of the apartment complex.

72
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,576
So we were about ready to part
our ways and I was asking him

73
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:26,051
if there was any chance he
was headed down to Arizona

74
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:27,320
anytime soon, and--

75
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,153
- But I wasn't.

76
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:30,716
- And that's kind of how, I
was looking for a ride to go

77
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:33,252
visit my family over a long
weekend that was coming up and--

78
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,886
- At least that was what she was claiming.

79
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,336
- That was legitimately
what I was looking--

80
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:39,811
Anyway, so we started talking
and he just super-easy

81
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:43,476
to talk to and conversation
flowed really easily and

82
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:46,265
we ended up standing outside
of the door of my apartment

83
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:47,655
and just chatting for a few minutes.

84
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:50,117
And I looked around
after a few minutes and

85
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,108
it looked like everybody
else had kind of gone inside

86
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,766
and I was like, "It must be getting later.

87
00:03:55,766 --> 00:03:59,500
So it was good to say
hi. Well, see ya later."

88
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,274
So I went inside and my jaw dropped.

89
00:04:03,274 --> 00:04:05,444
It was 4:00 AM.

90
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:09,248
We had stood on my doorstep
and talked for four hours

91
00:04:09,248 --> 00:04:13,658
and it literally had felt
like maybe 15, 20 minutes.

92
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,543
And I walk into my bedroom
and my roommate kind of

93
00:04:16,543 --> 00:04:18,982
rolled over and she's like, "What?

94
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:20,289
Where were you?"

95
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:23,428
And I told her I was
outside talking to Jeremy.

96
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:26,611
And then, the next words, which
I would always remember is,

97
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:29,427
what I said to my roommate was,

98
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:33,594
"Man, forever with that guy
would go really quickly."

99
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,305
- So now, we get to be
up at 3:00 and 4:00 AM--

100
00:04:37,305 --> 00:04:38,811
- [Both] Every night.

101
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:40,827
- With our babies.

102
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:45,377
- But, it feels like 12:30 PM.

103
00:04:45,377 --> 00:04:46,518
- Yeah.

104
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:48,104
- So what were your thought after that

105
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:50,191
stay up 'til 4:00 AM talking?

106
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:51,858
- I was happy that things had progressed.

107
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:53,979
I thought you were beautiful
and it was good to get to

108
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:55,983
know you and it was fun to talk
to you and I could see that

109
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,156
we had a lot of the same
interests of what we wanted.

110
00:04:58,156 --> 00:05:00,499
'Cause we were already talking about

111
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:02,194
what we wanted out of life.

112
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,575
We were having some deep, connecting,

113
00:05:04,575 --> 00:05:06,821
philosophical-type conversations.

114
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,461
- If you know this guy, it
doesn't take long to get to--

115
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:10,860
- Deep conversations.
- It wasn't--

116
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,034
- It wasn't just surface-level discussion.

117
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:17,067
Like, we were getting into
some meaty stuff and so

118
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:20,192
I was impressed with who she
was and I was excited to build

119
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:22,057
that friendship and...

120
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:24,548
- It was good.
- So that was our first dance.

121
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:26,048
- Our first dance.

122
00:05:27,918 --> 00:00:00,000
(light piano music)
