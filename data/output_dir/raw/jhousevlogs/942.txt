1
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:03,020
- If you watch family vlogs
then I'm sure that you've heard

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,575
of the candy "Hi Chew."

3
00:00:04,575 --> 00:00:06,598
I was giving my kids some
today out of the cupboard

4
00:00:06,598 --> 00:00:09,093
and there was this lone
chocolate chip that was

5
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:10,668
laying around in the cupboard.

6
00:00:10,668 --> 00:00:13,244
And so as I was eating
my Hi Chew, I grabbed the

7
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:16,528
chocolate chip and was eating
it at the same time and,

8
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:17,630
it was really good.

9
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:19,176
And then I had the idea
like, well why don't I try to

10
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:22,310
melt some chocolate and do
chocolate-covered Hi Chews?

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,248
So I just stirred some chocolate
chips in a cup, melted it,

12
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:27,782
and threw the Hi Chews in
there and stirred them around

13
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:29,032
and, uh, voila.

14
00:00:30,222 --> 00:00:32,943
Chocolate-covered Hi Chews.

15
00:00:32,943 --> 00:00:34,594
And it's really good.

16
00:00:34,594 --> 00:00:35,533
Kids, you want to try some?

17
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:36,843
- Yeah!

18
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:38,641
- They're pretty excited about this.

19
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:41,724
(fast playful music)

20
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:57,268
- And so I am heading to
a board meeting for our

21
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:58,617
local chamber of commerce.

22
00:00:58,617 --> 00:01:01,114
Our chamber of commerce
here is really cool.

23
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:02,987
They do big activities through the year

24
00:01:02,987 --> 00:01:05,194
for the whole community,
like a huge parade and a

25
00:01:05,194 --> 00:01:07,913
fall festival and a July 4th event.

26
00:01:07,913 --> 00:01:09,685
They give out scholarships.

27
00:01:09,685 --> 00:01:11,938
I, uh, I'm not sure if I'm
gonna show you any footage

28
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,686
in the actual meeting, we'll see.

29
00:01:14,686 --> 00:01:17,436
(woman mumbling)

30
00:01:22,237 --> 00:01:25,070
(meeting chatter)

31
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:30,201
We had a really great meeting.

32
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:31,416
It was exciting to rub shoulders

33
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:33,042
with some great people, you know,

34
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:34,643
there was a representative
there from our local

35
00:01:34,643 --> 00:01:37,359
school district and from
the hospital and just a lot

36
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,734
of really neat business
owners there and as you bring

37
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:42,195
all those minds together and
their experience, it's neat

38
00:01:42,195 --> 00:01:43,830
to hear the discussions that happen.

39
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,088
It's just fun to be a part of it.

40
00:01:45,088 --> 00:01:47,221
- So we're continuing
our study of Texas today.

41
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:49,728
We're actually going to
be studying all the states

42
00:01:49,728 --> 00:01:51,770
that we're driving through on
our trip to Arizona and then

43
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,750
we're gonna be studying
Arizona when we're in Arizona.

44
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,286
So I'm really excited about that.

45
00:01:56,286 --> 00:01:58,031
But we're just starting
with Texas, so tonight

46
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,402
we're having a Texas dinner.

47
00:01:59,402 --> 00:02:02,463
We read that their state food
is chili, so we're having

48
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,590
some chili, their state
tree is the pecan tree,

49
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,598
so we're having some pecans,
and their state fruit

50
00:02:06,598 --> 00:02:09,276
is grapefruit, so we're
having some grapefruit.

51
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:10,284
What do you guys think of pecans?

52
00:02:10,285 --> 00:02:11,483
- Yummy!

53
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:12,728
- Yummy.

54
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:14,559
- [Mom] Yeah Caleb wasn't sure
at first, he wouldn't try 'em

55
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,366
but now, what do you think?

56
00:02:16,366 --> 00:02:17,199
- Good.

57
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,316
- They're good?

58
00:02:18,316 --> 00:02:19,977
And you?

59
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:24,371
- I, I love them so much
that I ate too much that now

60
00:02:24,371 --> 00:02:26,036
my tummy's kind of hurting.

61
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:29,294
- Uh oh, you ready for some grapefruit?

62
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:32,377
Let's see Leesie take her first bite.

63
00:02:35,972 --> 00:02:37,972
- Wow, it's really good.

64
00:02:38,836 --> 00:02:41,722
- What does it taste like?

65
00:02:41,722 --> 00:02:45,305
- It's a little sour,
it tastes like lemon.

66
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:47,435
- Ah...

67
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:57,158
It kind of tastes like lemon
but a little bit more spicy,

68
00:02:58,337 --> 00:03:00,087
and kinda more juicy.

69
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:02,748
- [Mom] Hmmm.

70
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,831
- And a kinda more like..

71
00:03:06,122 --> 00:03:08,190
Strawberry-flavored.

72
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,341
- [Mom] Strawberry-flavored
lemons, awesome.

73
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:12,836
Okay Caleb, you ready?

74
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,169
Let's see what Caleb thinks.

75
00:03:20,547 --> 00:03:21,380
- Good.

76
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,832
- [Mom] (laughs)

77
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,082
Do you like it?

78
00:03:35,092 --> 00:03:36,675
Oh no, don't choke.

79
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:41,141
- [Brother] Do you like it?

80
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,587
- We're braiding.

81
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,266
- [Dad] Braiding, braiding what?

82
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,796
- It's my first time doing it.

83
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:47,331
- We're making a friendship bracelet.

84
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:48,164
- Yep.

85
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,448
- [Dad] Oh, cool.

86
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:54,795
- [Mom] So, she's been wanting
to have some time to do this,

87
00:03:54,795 --> 00:03:56,795
and we're working on it.

88
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,054
- And it's (mumbles)
- So we're getting some

89
00:04:00,054 --> 00:04:00,887
special time together.

90
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:02,992
- And we're, and it's making a braid.

91
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,051
- It is making a braid.

92
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,806
- [Mom] (mumbles).

93
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:09,389
- We are stirring up the chili.

94
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,264
- Hopefully it doesn't fly off.

95
00:04:20,264 --> 00:04:22,982
Our city has a cool Christmas
tree drop-off place.

96
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:26,634
They recycle the Christmas
trees and then use the mulch

97
00:04:26,634 --> 00:04:29,161
for the city walkways and parks.

98
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:30,078
Kinda cool.

99
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:37,686
Christmas is officially over.

100
00:04:37,686 --> 00:04:39,877
- (Kids screaming)

101
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:41,851
(Kids screaming)

102
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:43,375
(Kids screaming)

103
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:44,507
- (Mumbles)...last time.

104
00:04:44,507 --> 00:04:46,271
- Gee that means I have
to kill all of you.

105
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,548
- (Mumbles)

106
00:04:47,548 --> 00:00:00,000
- (Mom makes shooting sounds)
