1
00:00:00,417 --> 00:00:01,745
(funky upbeat music)

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:02,739
- What?

3
00:00:02,739 --> 00:00:03,851
Was that awesome?

4
00:00:03,851 --> 00:00:04,693
That is so much candy.

5
00:00:04,693 --> 00:00:05,842
And then I hear Jeremy say,

6
00:00:05,842 --> 00:00:07,481
I fell asleep on the toilet.

7
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:08,897
Who wants some more baby peas,

8
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:10,514
raise your hand?

9
00:00:10,514 --> 00:00:12,457
- Look at these dresses.

10
00:00:12,457 --> 00:00:14,131
- [Jeremy] First hot
chocolate of the season.

11
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:16,381
- Yep, it's a real pumpkin.

12
00:00:19,794 --> 00:00:22,127
- Today is a crazy busy day.

13
00:00:23,402 --> 00:00:25,364
It's not unusual for
me to start off the day

14
00:00:25,364 --> 00:00:27,531
early in the morning editing,

15
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:28,483
trying to get something done

16
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,532
before the kids get up.

17
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:31,931
But I think I hear that
they're just getting up,

18
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:34,203
so I'm gonna head upstairs.

19
00:00:34,203 --> 00:00:36,187
It looks like almost everybody's awake.

20
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:37,351
- Good morning.

21
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,054
- Everybody but Isaac.

22
00:00:39,054 --> 00:00:41,971
- Janae said her first word, onion.

23
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:45,832
- [Jared] Onion was her first word?

24
00:00:45,832 --> 00:00:46,845
- Yeah, she was making sounds

25
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,278
and apparently it sounded like onion.

26
00:00:49,278 --> 00:00:51,738
- And today is Michael's birthday.

27
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:52,636
- [Jeremy] Oh you have a birthday party

28
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,691
that you're going to later today?

29
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:55,524
- Yeah.

30
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:57,415
- I just couldn't sleep, I was so excited.

31
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:58,987
- [Jeremy] Alright, who
wants to go eat breakfast?

32
00:00:58,987 --> 00:00:59,878
- Me.
- Me.

33
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:01,215
- [Jeremy] Let's go.

34
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:02,683
- And Nae Nae.

35
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:05,183
(sweet music)

36
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:12,358
(uptempo funky music)

37
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:23,603
- Isaac was trying to play

38
00:01:23,603 --> 00:01:26,835
trying not to touch the lava.

39
00:01:26,835 --> 00:01:30,034
- [Jeremy] You're on the lava.

40
00:01:30,034 --> 00:01:30,867
There we go.

41
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,492
- If you get past this obstacle,

42
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,828
you have to kiss Mom four times

43
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,088
and kiss Janae two.

44
00:01:37,088 --> 00:01:39,411
- [Isaac] Are you allowed
to stay on one obstacle?

45
00:01:39,411 --> 00:01:40,956
- Nope nope, you have to move.

46
00:01:40,956 --> 00:01:42,572
- Unless you're mom or Janae

47
00:01:42,572 --> 00:01:44,564
and then you are an obstacle.

48
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,390
- [Jeremy] Alright the floor is lava.

49
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,223
Ready go.

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,860
(chill music)

51
00:01:54,464 --> 00:01:55,714
Good job Laura.

52
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:00,262
Whoa.

53
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:01,511
- I'm still on.

54
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,178
(piano playing)

55
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:16,684
♫ But now they're laughing
at our face, saying,

56
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:19,040
♫ Wake up you need to make money

57
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,873
♫ Yeah

58
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,290
(rock music)

59
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,608
- Every year, our county gets

60
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:29,248
25 to 30 different churches together

61
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,250
to go out into the local community

62
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,667
and help rebuild and repair houses

63
00:02:33,667 --> 00:02:36,379
for people who need it who
can't do it themselves.

64
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:37,451
It's one of the coolest things

65
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:39,784
that we do in our community.

66
00:02:45,547 --> 00:02:47,235
I remember the last time
I participated in this,

67
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:49,036
there was a widow that we were helping,

68
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,966
and her husband had just
died a year earlier.

69
00:02:51,966 --> 00:02:53,663
And there were a lot of
things around the house

70
00:02:53,663 --> 00:02:55,302
that she wasn't able to
do on her own anymore,

71
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:56,998
so we came and help with those things.

72
00:02:56,998 --> 00:02:58,977
It was really great to meet the person

73
00:02:58,977 --> 00:02:59,986
and to help them out.

74
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:01,055
- Caleb and Laura have
been really excited.

75
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,806
It's their cousin Michael's birthday today

76
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:04,994
and he's having a birthday
party, he's turning five.

77
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,905
You guys ready?

78
00:03:06,905 --> 00:03:08,809
You've got a present all ready to go.

79
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:10,642
Are you gonna hold it?

80
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:16,385
(knocking on door)

81
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:17,635
Here he is, hi.

82
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:20,894
They're so excited.

83
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,861
Are we going shopping?

84
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,164
These are so pretty.

85
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,179
Well we've finished up our shopping

86
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:28,888
and we got more than I planned.

87
00:03:28,888 --> 00:03:30,856
Isaac, what was the thing that you bought?

88
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:32,234
- Sport cards.

89
00:03:32,234 --> 00:03:33,067
- [Kendra] Yeah.

90
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,076
- Like always.

91
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:36,409
- Yeah, with your own money.

92
00:03:38,258 --> 00:03:40,562
It's amazing how helpful
Isaac and Elise are becoming,

93
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:42,577
like nine year olds and seven year olds,

94
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:44,551
they can seriously help out.

95
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,947
Okay, can you guys help
me load it into the van?

96
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:46,933
- [Elise] Yep.

97
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:47,809
- They're awesome.

98
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,345
So we're trying a new flavor of gum.

99
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,544
It was right there at the
checkout and it sounded good.

100
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,206
So it's a pineapple one.

101
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:54,433
What do you guys think?

102
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:55,759
- Very good.
- Amazing!

103
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,142
- You like it?

104
00:03:57,142 --> 00:03:57,975
We like gum.

105
00:03:57,975 --> 00:04:00,349
Two hours go by fast, it's
time to pick up the kids.

106
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,182
What?

107
00:04:01,182 --> 00:04:02,015
Is that awesome?

108
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:02,987
That is so much candy.

109
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:03,820
What'd they have buddy?

110
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:05,019
- I have a ton of these.

111
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:05,924
- [Jeremy] It's so powerful though,

112
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:07,296
with serving other people,

113
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,991
that something that's really simple for us

114
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,409
brought this woman to tears.

115
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,229
She came out and she was
just crying and grateful

116
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:17,403
as she was able to walk
down to get her mail.

117
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:19,262
Rebuilding Together is the organization

118
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,149
that put this together.

119
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,346
They do it in all different counties.

120
00:04:21,346 --> 00:04:23,313
So you can look up in your county,

121
00:04:23,313 --> 00:04:25,747
in your local area and
see if Rebuilding Together

122
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,725
is doing a type of project

123
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,374
that you could get involved in.

124
00:04:28,374 --> 00:04:32,035
- Okay so we figured out a
little secret with Janae.

125
00:04:32,035 --> 00:04:35,195
She still fusses and
cries in the car a lot,

126
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:37,548
but when you roll down
the window, she stops.

127
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:39,827
She we are going to be driving
with our window rolled down.

128
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:41,841
- We're hoping for good
weather, for a long time.

129
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:42,705
- We're hoping for a good winter.

130
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:44,677
- We might be moving to California.

131
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:46,966
- My hair's going crazy.

132
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:49,299
- My hair's going crazy too.

133
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,366
- So we just dropped Caleb and Elise off

134
00:04:52,366 --> 00:04:53,885
at an art class today,

135
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:55,461
and there's a new store that's giving away

136
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,197
free smoothies and we want that.

137
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,780
(bright music)

138
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:10,765
- So all three of our flavors are amazing.

139
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:12,436
- [Jeremy] They're really good.

140
00:05:12,436 --> 00:05:14,863
So Isaac, what flavor did you go with?

141
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:16,502
- Angel food.

142
00:05:16,502 --> 00:05:18,561
- I have strawberry extreme.

143
00:05:18,561 --> 00:05:21,426
- Mine is like Caribbean goodness.

144
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:22,546
It's really good.

145
00:05:22,546 --> 00:05:25,376
- Poor Janae, she's like, what's going on?

146
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:28,293
(enchanting music)

147
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,723
- So friends of ours built this house.

148
00:05:35,723 --> 00:05:37,306
- And decorated it.

149
00:05:42,815 --> 00:05:43,847
That's a cool door.

150
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:46,347
- [Jeremy] I love those doors.

151
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,174
- What do you think?

152
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:52,341
(elegant jazzy music)

153
00:05:56,638 --> 00:05:58,246
I love these light fixtures.

154
00:05:58,246 --> 00:05:59,754
They're just cool.

155
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,076
So I love Parade of Homes so much

156
00:06:01,076 --> 00:06:02,741
I wanted to bring Jeremy
out to see a few of them

157
00:06:02,741 --> 00:06:03,760
before the event ends,

158
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,701
and we have Isaac and Laura with us

159
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:06,534
so they can see some houses too.

160
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:07,934
- Can I check upstairs?

161
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:11,351
- [Kendra] Sure, let's go check upstairs.

162
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,507
- This crocheted blanket is so pretty.

163
00:06:25,989 --> 00:06:27,805
This is awesome,

164
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:28,722
I love this

165
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:31,266
I love this shower.

166
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:34,485
- [Jeremy] You just had to climb up?

167
00:06:34,485 --> 00:06:35,767
- Yeah.

168
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,934
This is the sister's room.

169
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,408
Look at these dresses.

170
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:42,825
Look at this one.

171
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:47,525
(lively music)

172
00:06:52,951 --> 00:06:54,375
- So we get home from Parade of Homes,

173
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,631
and Jeremy has to go to the bathroom,

174
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,959
not a big deal, right?

175
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,639
So I'm helping Isaac with something,

176
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,472
then I'm doing something
with the little girls

177
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,743
and I'm like, he's been in
there for like a long time,

178
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:04,087
so finally I walk outside the bathroom

179
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:06,573
and I'm like Jeremy,
are you okay in there?

180
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:07,941
And there's some silence,

181
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:09,044
and then I hear Jeremy say,

182
00:07:09,044 --> 00:07:11,279
uh, I fell asleep on the toilet.

183
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,368
I'm like are you serious?

184
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:15,226
He honest to goodness,
fell asleep on the toilet.

185
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,430
So he comes out,

186
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,426
and we're talking for a
minute, he disappears again,

187
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,262
look where I found him.

188
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,589
- I did put him to bed.

189
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,942
- [Kendra] Did you put your daddy to bed?

190
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:24,775
- Yeah.

191
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,457
- You put him to bed in your room?

192
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,057
(sweet music)

193
00:07:30,057 --> 00:07:31,690
I feel really bad that
I have to wake him up,

194
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,587
he's obviously super tired.

195
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:34,860
But I have to go run some errands

196
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,771
that I can't take the little kids on.

197
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:40,604
So he has to wake up,
so he can watch them.

198
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:42,018
So what you need to do

199
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,768
is you need to give Daddy kisses.

200
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:47,850
Climb up here right next to him

201
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,267
and give him a nice big kiss.

202
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:53,717
- Hey.

203
00:07:53,717 --> 00:07:56,114
(laughing)

204
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:57,540
Did you kiss me?

205
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,869
- [Laura] Yeah.

206
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:59,702
- I liked it.

207
00:07:59,702 --> 00:08:01,123
- So Isaac is headed to a birthday party

208
00:08:01,123 --> 00:08:02,679
for a friend that he's known for years,

209
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,842
probably since he was about two years old,

210
00:08:03,842 --> 00:08:04,798
and his friend is getting ready to move.

211
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:06,156
So that's the bummer part,

212
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:07,246
but the exciting part,

213
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,024
is that it is a Nerf blaster party.

214
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:09,991
That sounds fun.

215
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:11,644
Have fun dude.

216
00:08:11,644 --> 00:08:13,564
(knocking on door)

217
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,131
Elise, can we see what you made?

218
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:16,841
- A pumpkin.

219
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:17,674
- [Kendra] Very pretty.

220
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:18,965
- [Laura] Is that a real one?

221
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,215
- Yep, it's a real pumpkin.

222
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:22,198
- [Kendra] Janae's so into it.

223
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:23,740
Caleb, can I see yours?

224
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,073
- Very artistic.

225
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:27,255
- [Caleb] It's like a cloak.

226
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,806
- [Kendra] Ooh, is this the cloak?

227
00:08:28,806 --> 00:08:29,639
- [Elise] Yeah.

228
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,620
- [Kendra] Too bad it's
not an invisibility cloak.

229
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,453
That would be awesome.

230
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:33,423
- That would just be all black,

231
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:36,023
so I thought that would kinda be boring.

232
00:08:36,023 --> 00:08:38,280
- [Elise] So he put some red.

233
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,925
- [Kendra] Yeah, there it is.

234
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:42,767
Do you like their projects?

235
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,018
So fun, huh?

236
00:08:44,018 --> 00:08:45,649
- [Elise] Yeah, I just want to eat 'em.

237
00:08:45,649 --> 00:08:47,428
- [Kendra] Is this fun?

238
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:48,942
Who wants some more baby peas,

239
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:50,275
raise your hand?

240
00:08:51,668 --> 00:08:54,154
(screaming)

241
00:08:54,154 --> 00:08:57,089
If you want more food, raise your hand.

242
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,535
(screaming)

243
00:08:58,535 --> 00:08:59,368
Or scream.

244
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:03,135
Check out that bib, born to be loved.

245
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:04,855
That's right, baby girl.

246
00:09:04,855 --> 00:09:06,000
Today's one of those days as a mom

247
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,826
I feel like I've been in the car all day.

248
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,818
Birthday party drop off,
then art class drop off,

249
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:11,546
and then birthday party drop off,

250
00:09:11,546 --> 00:09:13,572
and then art class pick
up and bla bla bla,

251
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:15,268
there's just days when as a mom,

252
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:16,990
you like live in the car.

253
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,559
- Well we have a babysitter here

254
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,392
for the kids tonight,

255
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,344
because Kendra and I are going on a date.

256
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:22,690
So as I'm getting ready to go,

257
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,485
Laura stopped me and said
Dad, I want a big hug.

258
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:26,318
I love you,

259
00:09:26,318 --> 00:09:27,813
I hope you don't die.

260
00:09:27,813 --> 00:09:28,757
It was pretty cute.

261
00:09:28,757 --> 00:09:31,590
(ambulance siren)

262
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:34,397
- It's been awhile since Jeremy and I

263
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:36,381
have been out on a date,
just the two of us.

264
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:37,214
And so we're excited.

265
00:09:37,214 --> 00:09:38,983
We're hitting a restaurant
where we can hopefully

266
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:41,205
eat outside because it's so gorgeous out.

267
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,935
So today is obviously
homecoming in the town we're in,

268
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,014
there's all these little cute couples

269
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:47,555
with their dresses taking pictures,

270
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:50,018
and it reminds me homecoming and dances,

271
00:09:50,018 --> 00:09:52,956
and you took me out to
homecoming when we were dating.

272
00:09:52,956 --> 00:09:53,789
- At BYU.

273
00:09:53,789 --> 00:09:54,622
- At college, yeah.
- At college.

274
00:09:54,622 --> 00:09:56,126
- Have you been to homecoming this season?

275
00:09:56,126 --> 00:09:59,039
Let us know up here in the poll.

276
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,122
(bright piano music)

277
00:10:05,134 --> 00:10:05,967
So it's gorgeous out,

278
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,077
but I'm almost a little bit cold,

279
00:10:07,077 --> 00:10:09,410
and it's funny, because
it's the first time of year,

280
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:11,047
where it's like, oh wait,
I need to start bringing

281
00:10:11,047 --> 00:10:12,920
a jacket when I go places.

282
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,583
- [Jeremy] So I had a jacket in the car.

283
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:17,831
- Jeremy ran to the car
and got the jacket for me.

284
00:10:17,831 --> 00:10:20,461
(bright music)

285
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,414
- So we decided to half
and half their cheeseburger

286
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,675
and salad, and we're really hungry.

287
00:10:23,675 --> 00:10:24,816
This looks good.

288
00:10:24,816 --> 00:10:26,095
- That way we can feel healthy

289
00:10:26,095 --> 00:10:27,681
and keep the burger and fries.

290
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,100
- [Jeremy] Even though this isn't healthy.

291
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,098
- Oh come on, there's lettuce in there.

292
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:34,546
- So after dinner we were
walking around the square,

293
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,583
and it was feeling a little bit chilly.

294
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:38,099
And there's this amazing place

295
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,607
that does hot chocolate right here.

296
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:42,286
The first hot chocolate of the season.

297
00:10:42,286 --> 00:10:44,119
- It's like so pretty.

298
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:46,326
- [Jeremy] Isn't that yummy?

299
00:10:46,326 --> 00:10:47,159
- That is really good.

300
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,478
- [Jeremy] And it has a
dark chocolate taste to it

301
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:52,695
that's different than your
normal just milk chocolate,

302
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,744
I feel like, it was good.

303
00:10:54,744 --> 00:10:55,716
- That is good.

304
00:10:55,716 --> 00:10:56,893
- [Caleb] Good night, J House out.

305
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:57,945
- Shake it out.

306
00:10:57,945 --> 00:11:01,057
(bright music)

307
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:03,307
(laughing)

308
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:05,858
- There it is.

309
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:08,326
- [Kendra] Can you guess
who didn't take a nap today?

310
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:10,016
- This is the winner.

311
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,327
- Go!
(screaming)

312
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:12,160
- Yum.

313
00:11:12,160 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Elise] Three two one.
