1
00:00:00,314 --> 00:00:03,046
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:05,796
(kids screaming)

3
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:10,836
(gentle acoustic music)

4
00:00:12,352 --> 00:00:13,304
- [Jeremy] She likes that makeup.

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,282
She wants to eat it.

6
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,623
- I know.

7
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:20,790
- I'm putting on makeup on
her and this is the lip part.

8
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:31,808
- [Jeremy] I love your
makeup choices for her.

9
00:00:31,808 --> 00:00:33,381
- Thank you.

10
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:35,469
And I know how to drive.

11
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,068
- [Jeremy] Wait, you know how to drive?

12
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:39,435
When did you start driving?

13
00:00:39,435 --> 00:00:41,352
- Um, 12,000 years ago.

14
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:46,835
I used to drive back when I was a grandma.

15
00:00:46,835 --> 00:00:48,471
- [Jeremy] Obviously.

16
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:50,804
- So, when I drive, I relax,

17
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,688
and then when I'm done relaxing,

18
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:59,671
and I see a stop sign, I stop,

19
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:04,188
and hold onto the wheel, and then I rest,

20
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,689
and rest, and rest, until I see something.

21
00:01:08,752 --> 00:01:11,335
(upbeat music)

22
00:01:27,405 --> 00:01:29,799
- We're training to go all the way around

23
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:32,153
our, like, whole cul-de-sac.

24
00:01:32,153 --> 00:01:36,837
- Because dad's training
for going on a big run.

25
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:39,015
- Are you actually gonna
be running with us?

26
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,590
- [Jeremy] I have no idea
what you're talking about.

27
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,489
- We're gonna ride around the neighborhood

28
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,703
while you're running right by us.

29
00:01:46,703 --> 00:01:47,901
- [Jeremy] Who decided this?

30
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:48,910
- All of us.

31
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,315
(laughs)

32
00:01:50,315 --> 00:01:51,659
- [Jeremy] Wait, but
that means I have to run?

33
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:52,534
- Yeah.

34
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:53,372
- [Jeremy] Did you find a worm?

35
00:01:53,372 --> 00:01:55,539
- We're trying to save it.

36
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:57,408
I'm putting my shadow on it.

37
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,491
- [Elise] Get it in the tree's shade.

38
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:05,633
Now, Caleb, get it down there.

39
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:13,611
- Think that's enough shade?

40
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,870
- [Jeremy] You wanna
make sure it stays alive?

41
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,777
- I'm gonna put my shadow over it.

42
00:02:22,777 --> 00:02:25,610
I don't know how to keep it alive.

43
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,455
- So, I have the kids helping
me with the classic project

44
00:02:32,455 --> 00:02:36,016
that a dad gives to his kids: moving dirt.

45
00:02:36,016 --> 00:02:38,433
(rock music)

46
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:43,196
So, we're having a
problem that when we get

47
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,949
a lot of rain, we're getting big puddles,

48
00:02:45,949 --> 00:02:47,075
and some of those puddles are coming

49
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,142
up against the foundation of the house.

50
00:02:49,142 --> 00:02:50,427
- Are there any wasp's nests?

51
00:02:50,427 --> 00:02:52,837
- [Jeremy] If there are, they're
typically right under here.

52
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:55,660
Come check and see if there are any.

53
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,493
- Whoa.

54
00:02:57,425 --> 00:02:58,633
- [Jeremy] Is there any wasp's nests?

55
00:02:58,633 --> 00:02:59,466
- A ton.

56
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,258
- I can't see anything.

57
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:04,941
Whoa.

58
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:07,453
- [Jeremy] Is there a wasp nest?

59
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:08,803
(whimpers)

60
00:03:08,803 --> 00:03:10,254
Do you see it?

61
00:03:10,254 --> 00:03:12,671
(rock music)

62
00:03:21,253 --> 00:03:22,289
Isaac, what do you think
of this kind of work?

63
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:23,937
- I like it.

64
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,998
Well, it is hard.

65
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:27,281
- [Jeremy] It is hard work.

66
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,939
Thanks so much for helping us out.

67
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:29,915
- Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:29,915 --> 00:03:30,832
- [Jeremy] You having fun?

69
00:03:30,832 --> 00:03:31,665
- Yep.

70
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,535
- [Caleb] Yep.

71
00:03:36,535 --> 00:03:38,067
- [Jeremy] Is it tilting towards the slope

72
00:03:38,067 --> 00:03:39,535
and away from the house?

73
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:40,644
- Mm-hmm.

74
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:41,545
- [Jeremy] Okay, that's what we want.

75
00:03:41,545 --> 00:03:43,520
Do you wanna test it with some water?

76
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,353
- Yeah!

77
00:03:44,353 --> 00:03:45,186
- [Jeremy] You can see if it flows down

78
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:46,200
the way we want it to.

79
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,783
Okay, Caleb, turn on the water.

80
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,041
Will it flow down the hill?

81
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,118
- It's coming down, literally.

82
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:57,201
I'm gonna climb up so I don't get it.

83
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:00,328
- [Elise] It's going
where we want it to be.

84
00:04:00,328 --> 00:04:02,657
It's like a mini-waterfall.

85
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:03,657
I love this.

86
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:08,092
We're gonna make a pool!

87
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:10,194
- [Jeremy] Nope, we just
want it to flow down the hill

88
00:04:10,194 --> 00:04:12,361
and not towards the house.

89
00:04:13,478 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm sure glad you like to work, buddy.

90
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,083
(upbeat music)

91
00:04:29,378 --> 00:04:30,277
- It feels good to mow the lawn.

92
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:32,236
I haven't mowed it for a while.

93
00:04:32,236 --> 00:04:33,766
Bit out of practice, I think.

94
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:36,349
(gentle music)

95
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:51,844
So, we've had our van for a while,

96
00:04:51,844 --> 00:04:53,512
and we bought it used initially,

97
00:04:53,512 --> 00:04:55,800
and we definitely can
tell that it's about time

98
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,675
for us to be thinking about a new vehicle,

99
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:58,997
and so we're headed to dealerships tonight

100
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:00,997
to see which van to get.

101
00:05:01,977 --> 00:05:04,394
(rock music)

102
00:05:07,334 --> 00:05:08,682
Our current van is a Toyota Sienna,

103
00:05:08,682 --> 00:05:10,720
so we want to check out
the new Toyota Sienna,

104
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,609
see what the new features are.

105
00:05:13,609 --> 00:05:15,282
So, I'm trying to see,
like, little details.

106
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,752
Like, how the seats move and stow, like,

107
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,874
what kind of of a, what's
that thing called in the back?

108
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,978
Trunk space?

109
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,804
Like, what kind of baggage
space, what is that called?

110
00:05:22,804 --> 00:05:23,801
- [Jeremy] Trunk space.

111
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,810
The trunk, what kind of--

112
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,643
- How much storage.

113
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:27,707
How much storage there is in the vehicle.

114
00:05:27,707 --> 00:05:29,203
This one has a sunroof.

115
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,397
The kids loved that before.

116
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,704
- [Jeremy] Automatic seats.

117
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:35,195
- [Kendra] So, we have
a 2006 Toyota Sienna.

118
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,112
- [Dealer] Oh, do you?

119
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:37,771
Okay.

120
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,670
- And it doesn't do that.

121
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,559
(laughs)

122
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:42,206
So, Jeremy's super happy
right now in the show room,

123
00:05:42,206 --> 00:05:44,640
because they're showing a football game.

124
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,148
And it's not just any football game--

125
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:47,539
- It's a BYU football game.

126
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,316
- Yeah, that's true.

127
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,214
- And we're winning.

128
00:05:50,214 --> 00:05:51,427
And that's almost over.

129
00:05:51,427 --> 00:05:52,634
Which is a good thing,
because I don't want to go

130
00:05:52,634 --> 00:05:55,297
look at cars when there's a game on.

131
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:56,312
- [Kendra] You have something in your eye.

132
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:57,233
- Thank you.

133
00:05:57,233 --> 00:05:58,163
- [Kendra] I got it.

134
00:05:58,163 --> 00:05:58,996
- Go BYU!

135
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:00,865
Yeah!

136
00:06:04,136 --> 00:06:06,618
It's not much of an eight seat.

137
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:08,775
- [Kendra] Oh, that is totally lame.

138
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:10,746
You couldn't anchor a car seat there.

139
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,726
- I couldn't put my butt there.

140
00:06:12,726 --> 00:06:13,559
- TMI.

141
00:06:16,578 --> 00:06:17,915
So now, we're gonna check out the Honda.

142
00:06:17,915 --> 00:06:19,384
When we were buying our Sienna years ago,

143
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:21,301
we looked at a Honda and a Toyota,

144
00:06:21,301 --> 00:06:24,288
so we'll see which one
we think is better now.

145
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:25,661
- [Dealer] And these
here, you can move them.

146
00:06:25,661 --> 00:06:26,932
And this one here.

147
00:06:26,932 --> 00:06:28,463
- So, another option for our family

148
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,630
would be this Honda Pilot.

149
00:06:31,628 --> 00:06:34,300
- [Jeremy] We would look
way too cool in this thing.

150
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,219
- So, what I don't like about these

151
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:37,317
is it has a real door,
and I feel like my kids

152
00:06:37,317 --> 00:06:38,956
would always be opening it into things,

153
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:41,812
and also, then, you can't
have an automatic door.

154
00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,217
Well, unfortunately, my takeaway from this

155
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:45,545
is that I think I just
wanna keep our old van.

156
00:06:45,545 --> 00:06:47,126
I really like it, and, like,

157
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:49,155
there's some cool bells and
whistles on these newer ones,

158
00:06:49,155 --> 00:06:51,256
but there's also things that
I prefer about our old van,

159
00:06:51,256 --> 00:06:53,606
so why go through that
hassle and pay more money?

160
00:06:53,606 --> 00:06:55,074
I think we should just keep our old one.

161
00:06:55,074 --> 00:06:56,380
What do you think?

162
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,656
- I don't know.

163
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:59,230
- [Kendra] That was profound.

164
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,367
- I would love to know, on the whole,

165
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,770
which car company is your favorite,

166
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,937
between Toyota, Honda,
Nissan, Ford, and Chevrolet?

167
00:07:07,198 --> 00:07:09,642
She's so tired right now.

168
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,929
- [Kendra] She's been a trooper.

169
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,126
- "Get me out of here."

170
00:07:13,126 --> 00:07:14,732
- [Kendra] Wanna go take a nap?

171
00:07:14,732 --> 00:07:16,498
And go out to dinner with Mom and Dad?

172
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:17,418
- Let's go.

173
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:19,865
- We currently own two Toyotas,

174
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:21,790
but it's actually not because we're, like,

175
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,763
only Toyota people, that's
just the way it happened

176
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:25,384
when we bought the newest years ago.

177
00:07:25,384 --> 00:07:27,141
I don't know if I have
a favorite car company.

178
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:29,196
Do you have a favorite car company?

179
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,048
- I don't.

180
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,530
- We are not big car people.

181
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,969
we like them to go, and, ooh,

182
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:35,745
I'm a big fan of air conditioning.

183
00:07:35,745 --> 00:07:38,426
For dinner tonight, we're
gonna eat at Abuelo's.

184
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:39,975
I think we both love that they'll bring us

185
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,536
chips and salsa the minute we sit down.

186
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:43,941
That's, like, the best
part of Mexican food.

187
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,608
(festive music)

188
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,521
That is her first time in a high-chair.

189
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:53,083
- [Jeremy] At a restaurant, yeah.

190
00:07:53,083 --> 00:07:55,040
- So, Janae is having a super strong

191
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,538
reaction to the parachute.

192
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:57,440
I can't tell if she likes it

193
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,750
or if she hates it or
if she's scared of it,

194
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,666
or if she wants to join in on the fun.

195
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,063
Here, see what happens.

196
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:04,285
- Let's put Janae in here.

197
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,436
- No, we're not gonna put Janae in here.

198
00:08:05,436 --> 00:08:06,353
Ready?

199
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,506
Go.

200
00:08:07,506 --> 00:08:10,173
(kids laughing)

201
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:19,104
Oh, there's the baby.

202
00:08:19,104 --> 00:08:19,937
Say hi.

203
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,245
Hi.

204
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,933
♫ Let's put the oil in a pot

205
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:28,888
♫ And make it real hot

206
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,180
♫ Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle, sizzle

207
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,347
♫ Sizzle, sizzle, pop

208
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:40,275
(squealing)

209
00:08:45,885 --> 00:08:47,550
Do you like it?

210
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,323
Do you like it?

211
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,438
I think she likes it.

212
00:08:50,438 --> 00:08:53,493
I think she wants to play so bad.

213
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:55,309
Or she's scared.

214
00:08:55,309 --> 00:08:56,290
- [Jeremy] Or constipated.

215
00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:00,123
(kids laughing and squealing)

216
00:09:04,526 --> 00:09:06,693
(screams)

217
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,389
- J House out.

218
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:11,300
- Good night.

219
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,532
J House out.

220
00:09:12,532 --> 00:09:14,465
Oh, is that a kiss?

221
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:15,632
Yes, big girl.

222
00:09:18,362 --> 00:09:20,180
Nice one, Lise!

223
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,700
- Alexa, make a fart noise.

224
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,057
- [Alexa] I've never, ever broken wind.

225
00:09:25,057 --> 00:00:00,000
(all laugh)
