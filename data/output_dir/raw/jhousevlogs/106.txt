1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,716
So my sister in law
Michelle just came up with

2
00:00:01,716 --> 00:00:04,226
the most genius thing for bike riding.

3
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:06,027
Dad sometimes I call you Jeremy

4
00:00:06,027 --> 00:00:08,267
and sometimes I call mom Kendra.

5
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,470
Snuggle season.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,303
- [Jeremy] Crunchy.

7
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,386
I saw you in the first place.

8
00:00:13,386 --> 00:00:15,906
So Nae Nae is doing the cutest thing.

9
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:16,750
There's a new deli.

10
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,583
And I got a big nasty.

11
00:00:30,642 --> 00:00:31,891
Nae Nae.

12
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,105
(piano plays)

13
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,438
(baby coos)

14
00:00:37,363 --> 00:00:39,863
(piano plays)

15
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:45,581
Here it goes.

16
00:00:45,581 --> 00:00:49,414
Wee.
- [Jeremy] Woo (laughs)

17
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:53,323
So, Nae Nae is doing the cutest thing.

18
00:00:53,323 --> 00:00:57,250
When she crawls right now,
she keeps this hand as a fist

19
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:01,154
and that hand open and
she does that every time.

20
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,684
What are you doing?

21
00:01:02,684 --> 00:01:03,767
Look at that.

22
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,907
Ken and I were saying,
that's one of those things

23
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:08,714
that she's doing that
we don't wanna forget

24
00:01:08,714 --> 00:01:13,573
'cause she's gonna grow
out of that any time soon.

25
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,345
Who woke up from her nap?

26
00:01:16,345 --> 00:01:17,904
Hey, hi.

27
00:01:17,904 --> 00:01:19,626
She's saying hello.

28
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:22,226
Okay, so where are the rocky mountains?

29
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,158
There's the rocky mountains.

30
00:01:23,158 --> 00:01:25,317
The continental divide.

31
00:01:25,317 --> 00:01:27,884
Yup, the continental
divide means that the water

32
00:01:27,884 --> 00:01:31,132
on this side goes to the, which ocean?

33
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,384
Pacific.
Pacific.

34
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,742
And the water on this side goes to, where?

35
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:36,141
Goes to the Atlantic.

36
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:38,741
Yep, so that's why it's
called the continental divide.

37
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:41,512
It divides our continent
with where the water goes.

38
00:01:41,512 --> 00:01:45,851
I love how she crawls with
the one fist and the one hand.

39
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:48,461
- [Jeremy] She wants you.

40
00:01:48,461 --> 00:01:51,952
But then on the wood,
she opens up that hand.

41
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:52,818
How interesting.

42
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:56,955
So it's only on carpet that she does it.

43
00:01:56,955 --> 00:01:58,665
Little tongue sticking out.

44
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:00,415
Yeah watch, woo, woo.

45
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:04,575
(baby coos)

46
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:06,992
(soft music)

47
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:24,525
(crunch)

48
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:26,108
Crunchy.
Mm hmm.

49
00:02:31,122 --> 00:02:33,835
So this afternoon, I am
going on a bike ride.

50
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:35,941
Like a legit real bike
ride with some friends.

51
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:38,911
We're loading up the bikes on
the back of my friend's truck

52
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:41,098
and we're gonna ride out to this fun place

53
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:42,987
and Jeremy is getting me all set up

54
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,013
so that you guys can see what's going on.

55
00:02:45,013 --> 00:02:48,052
I don't know if that's perfectly
straight but it'll work.

56
00:02:48,052 --> 00:02:49,644
That looks legit.

57
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:50,844
There it is.

58
00:02:50,844 --> 00:02:51,958
Is that angle right?

59
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,108
I think it'll work but it
might be a little bit down.

60
00:02:54,108 --> 00:02:57,097
It might be a little bit bouncy.

61
00:02:57,097 --> 00:02:58,634
So, the kids have some friends over

62
00:02:58,634 --> 00:03:01,109
and although it's freezing
outside, they're out here

63
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:02,667
playing in the woods with tools

64
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:05,983
and Isaac is gonna go up
and spy on Caleb and Gary.

65
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:08,030
Lot of leaves fell today.

66
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,906
Okay, so I'm out with my friends.

67
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,038
We're gonna be biking.

68
00:03:10,038 --> 00:03:12,784
Here's all the bikes loaded up.

69
00:03:12,784 --> 00:03:15,096
And there's the trail.

70
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:16,555
I am layering up.

71
00:03:16,555 --> 00:03:18,730
I'm not one of those people
that has cool winter clothes.

72
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,633
I just never have, so
instead I'm just layering.

73
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,591
So I'm starting with these leggings

74
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,390
and I'm gonna put on
an extra layer of pants

75
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,779
and I've got my uh, what's
this thing called, headband?

76
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,245
So, hopefully I stay warm enough.

77
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:30,706
This is smart, get warmed up.

78
00:03:30,706 --> 00:03:33,539
(energetic music)

79
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,735
- [Jeremy] What are you guys working on?

80
00:03:49,735 --> 00:03:51,474
I didn't want the table anymore,

81
00:03:51,474 --> 00:03:53,499
so we chose to take it apart.

82
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:54,906
They're back there.

83
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:56,293
They're trying to spy on us.

84
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,522
You know I can see you.

85
00:03:57,522 --> 00:04:00,530
Yeah, I saw you in the first place.

86
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,599
- [Jeremy] Sneaky.

87
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:03,432
They caught you.

88
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:04,682
It was a good hiding spot.

89
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:07,583
It's hard to sneak up on
someone with the crunchy leaves.

90
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,452
So apparently we went four miles so far

91
00:04:09,452 --> 00:04:11,187
and now were taking a little break.

92
00:04:11,187 --> 00:04:13,624
It is gorgeous out here
and loving this trail.

93
00:04:13,624 --> 00:04:15,587
My knees and my bum are a little bit sore

94
00:04:15,587 --> 00:04:17,375
but I think that just
comes with riding a bike.

95
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,358
But the weather, I thought
it was gonna be too cold,

96
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,901
but it feels awesome.

97
00:04:21,902 --> 00:04:23,383
So my sister in law,
Michelle, just came up with

98
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:26,910
the most genius thing for bike riding.

99
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,743
You like that?

100
00:04:27,743 --> 00:04:30,092
Basically it's a diaper,
you're looking at.

101
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,126
So extra padding.

102
00:04:32,126 --> 00:04:34,573
(laughs)

103
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,656
Michelle this is awesome.

104
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,094
The funny thing is, I'm kinda jealous.

105
00:04:40,094 --> 00:04:41,947
I wish I had one of those
so I could do that too.

106
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,866
That looks way more comfortable.

107
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,602
Killing two birds with one stone there.

108
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,602
(adventurous music)

109
00:04:53,061 --> 00:04:57,126
So one of our neighbors
is using a wood fire.

110
00:04:57,126 --> 00:05:00,151
I love the smell of the fire place.

111
00:05:00,151 --> 00:05:01,598
It's kinda cool.

112
00:05:01,598 --> 00:05:04,561
It's starting to feel
like Christmas in here.

113
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,561
(adventurous music)

114
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:13,640
(mischievous music)

115
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,714
(adventurous music)

116
00:05:16,714 --> 00:05:17,843
Well, we survived.

117
00:05:17,843 --> 00:05:21,829
It started raining so I'm like pretty wet.

118
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,602
But we did it and it felt
great and it was beautiful.

119
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:27,471
The leaves falling from the
trees and crunching on the path

120
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:28,623
and just being able to visit.

121
00:05:28,623 --> 00:05:30,215
And anyway, I think I'm
gonna be sore tomorrow

122
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,015
but it felt good today.

123
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:34,098
Have a good time Isaac.

124
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:38,775
We're getting hot chocolate at QT.

125
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:40,529
- [Woman] If you can run the
machine it's quite tricky.

126
00:05:40,529 --> 00:05:42,131
If I can run the machine, let's see.

127
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:46,298
Stop before it gets to the
top 'cause it keeps coming.

128
00:05:54,946 --> 00:05:57,222
Oh, yum, hot chocolate.

129
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,927
So my friend Kate had a genius tip.

130
00:05:58,927 --> 00:06:00,616
You put some frozen hot
chocolate in the bottom

131
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,412
and then fill it up with
regular hot chocolate

132
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:03,387
so it's not too hot.

133
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:04,523
Because I'm always such a wimp.

134
00:06:04,523 --> 00:06:06,080
Like it's always too
hot, it burns my mouth.

135
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,422
This is perfect.

136
00:06:07,422 --> 00:06:11,169
I call you dad, but
normally I call you dada.

137
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,855
But Janae calls you dad
and I call you daddy.

138
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:16,205
- [Jeremy] What other
names do you call me?

139
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:17,987
Sometimes I call you Jeremy

140
00:06:17,987 --> 00:06:20,740
and sometimes I call mom Kendra.

141
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:23,348
Because mom's name is Kendra.

142
00:06:23,348 --> 00:06:24,590
Yeah.

143
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,173
(upbeat music)

144
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:33,364
How was the birthday party?

145
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:34,254
Good.

146
00:06:34,254 --> 00:06:35,245
What'd you guys do?

147
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:38,664
So we went down a zip
line, it was really fun.

148
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,497
And it was pretty far.

149
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:47,677
Then we played capture the flag
but it was in their version

150
00:06:47,677 --> 00:06:51,309
so literally, they had it
so, to get our present,

151
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:53,142
you have to do a duel.

152
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,875
(samba music)

153
00:06:57,912 --> 00:07:00,513
It has been so long since
we've been on a date night.

154
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,346
It has.

155
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:02,179
At least, it feels that way to me.

156
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,685
We don't have Janae, that's crazy.

157
00:07:03,685 --> 00:07:04,899
It feels weird.

158
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,051
There's a new deli that we're gonna go to.

159
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,968
Because I like delis.

160
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,745
So it's kinda hard because
we've never been here before

161
00:07:12,745 --> 00:07:15,152
so to pick items, we're
just kind of guessing.

162
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:16,993
So I went with one of their classics.

163
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:18,343
Like, apparently, they're
known for their clubs,

164
00:07:18,343 --> 00:07:19,783
so I'm gonna try their club.

165
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:23,533
And I got a half of a
spud and a big nasty.

166
00:07:25,218 --> 00:07:27,363
We'll see how that turns out.

167
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,286
This looks so good, my only problem is,

168
00:07:30,286 --> 00:07:32,869
I think I'm hungrier than this.

169
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,247
Well, we might have to go eat
more later, somewhere else.

170
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:44,353
We're buying clothes for Jeremy.

171
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:45,874
It's fun.

172
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:47,104
It feels like we just did that,

173
00:07:47,104 --> 00:07:49,029
but it was actually like a decade ago.

174
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:51,091
So my biggest thing, is
I wanna get some jeans

175
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:53,314
that are a little bit more fitted

176
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:57,469
but I can move in, so that
they're comfortable to wear.

177
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:01,469
All right, now I'm gonna
try on all the clothes.

178
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:06,845
Definitely trying to lose weight right now

179
00:08:06,845 --> 00:08:09,120
and so it's hard to go
shopping when you feel

180
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,120
a little bigger than you want to be.

181
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:22,541
Kendra wants a mug.

182
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:25,843
We own two mugs and I think
we might need another one.

183
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,379
Time for another mug.

184
00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:29,413
But which one?

185
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:33,246
Don't quit your day
dream, wifey, like boss.

186
00:08:36,405 --> 00:08:37,754
Snuggle season.

187
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:39,023
Kendra likes to snuggle.

188
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:40,760
I do, I'm a snuggler.

189
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,972
Cup of happy.

190
00:08:41,972 --> 00:08:43,024
Oh what fun.

191
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,476
When in doubt, buy toilet paper.

192
00:08:44,476 --> 00:08:45,531
I can't remember if we're out or not,

193
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,599
but if you think it, buy it.

194
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:48,936
We've been out of cereal.

195
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:49,935
It's been tragic.

196
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:51,859
Nothing ends a good date night like -

197
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:52,692
Cereal.

198
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:59,886
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

199
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,610
So Janae just said her very first word.

200
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,429
That one looks pretty cute.

201
00:09:03,429 --> 00:09:04,842
Thank you.

202
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,596
So I have my hair down today.

203
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:09,566
My whole family's a little confused.

204
00:09:09,566 --> 00:00:00,000
(cheerful music)
