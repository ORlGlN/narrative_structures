00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:20,581
We have been challenged
by the Ballinger family

00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:27,246

This next instruction, you asked for me

51
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:12,698
to use a knife.

52
00:02:15,192 --> 00:02:17,442
(laughing)

And give it to me, so I can eat it.

60
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:49,638
- Have at it.

61
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,372
Does it taste like a peanut butter

62
00:02:53,372 --> 00:02:54,955
and honey sandwich?

63
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,795
- No, okay.

64
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,868
Fail!

65
00:02:58,868 --> 00:02:59,701
- [Kendra] What do you think now,

66
00:02:59,701 --> 00:03:01,457
is it an easy or hard challenge.

67
00:03:01,457 --> 00:03:04,749
- Hard, and especially
because it's my dad.

68
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:06,450
- [Kendra] So how are you
feeling about your instructions?

69
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,238
- Really good, I did it very specifically.

70
00:03:10,238 --> 00:03:11,109
- [Kendra] Very nice.

71
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,317
- I will now follow
Elise's exact instructions.

72
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,317
- You get out the bread.

73
00:03:19,042 --> 00:03:20,754
You take two pieces of bread

74
00:03:20,754 --> 00:03:24,587
and then you spread them
out on a paper plate.

75
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:30,449
And then, you get out the
honey and the peanut butter.

76
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,460
You get out a butter knife.

77
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:44,885
- Get out peanut butter and spread

78
00:03:44,885 --> 00:03:46,958
on a slice of bread.

79
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,588
(lively music)

80
00:03:49,588 --> 00:03:51,838
(laughing)

81
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,993
Put honey on same side
as the peanut butter

82
00:03:58,993 --> 00:04:00,826
and put them together.

83
00:04:02,298 --> 00:04:04,548
(laughing)

84
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:08,501
That's the end.

85
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:10,633
- [Kendra] So Caleb, do
you think your instructions

86
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:12,372
are gonna work?

87
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:15,228
- You get out some bread.

88
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:18,561
- And then he told me to get the pieces.

89
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:28,277
(laughing)

90
00:04:36,653 --> 00:04:40,653
- And then put some peanut
butter on both sides.

91
00:04:46,176 --> 00:04:49,441
And then put on a little bit of honey

92
00:04:49,441 --> 00:04:50,941
and then close it.

93
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:58,084
(laughing)

94
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,943
My turn.

95
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:04,117
- And then you're done.

96
00:05:04,117 --> 00:05:06,313
- I'm so excited.

97
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:07,571
- [Kendra] So do you
think you're instructions

98
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,406
are gonna work?

99
00:05:09,406 --> 00:05:11,118
- I don't think so.

100
00:05:11,118 --> 00:05:13,443
- Then why are you excited?

101
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:15,004
- Because I like it.

102
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:15,837
- I like it.

103
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,989
Laura's instructions were
pretty basic and simple.

104
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:23,468
- You have to put on the
butter and then honey

105
00:05:23,468 --> 00:05:25,060
and then you eat it.

106
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,393
And then you wash your hands

107
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,149
and then play.

108
00:05:30,149 --> 00:05:32,565
- Laura's instructions
were to put on butter

109
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,315
and honey and eat it,

110
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:37,678
then wash hands and play.

111
00:05:37,678 --> 00:05:40,345
(playful music)

112
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,928
(laughing)

113
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:56,778
Now I'm washing hands and I'm playing.

114
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,974
(laughing)

115
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:07,895
(water running)

116
00:06:07,895 --> 00:06:10,302
Laura's instructions exactly.

117
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:11,135
- Alright, now we're gonna see

118
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:13,462
who wants another chance
to try to beat Dad.

119
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,791
- So for round two, we're
letting the kids team up

120
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,661
and they're gonna write
down their instructions

121
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:19,430
and try to get it right this time.

122
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,445
Lisa and Caleb against Isaac and Laura.

123
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,195
(dramatic music)

124
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:30,181
- Get the plate and put
it on the table smoothly.

125
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,469
- I think we're gonna win,

126
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,341
because you're a better cooker

127
00:06:33,341 --> 00:06:36,013
and I'm better at explaining stuff.

128
00:06:36,013 --> 00:06:37,300
- And you get the pieces.

129
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,825
- You've got to say get the bread out.

130
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:42,312
- And then the dot, good.

131
00:06:42,312 --> 00:06:45,329
Should we get a butter knife,

132
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:49,127
because we didn't say get a butter knife.

133
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:51,024
- I think we're gonna win.

134
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:54,524
- Let's have our first one be get a plate.

135
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:58,187
What do you think we should do.

136
00:06:58,187 --> 00:07:02,354
- I think we should do wash
our hands and then eat,

137
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:05,889
and then you come home.

138
00:07:08,937 --> 00:07:10,576
- [Jeremy] You getting all this Isaac?

139
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:13,601
- And then brush our teeth and
then watch what we all want,

140
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,468
and then go to bed.

141
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:16,562
- What did you say?

142
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,395
(Jeremy laughs)

143
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,228
- That.

144
00:07:18,228 --> 00:07:19,061
- Alright, this is round two,

145
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:21,874
I'm gonna follow the
instructions of Elise and Caleb

146
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:22,707
and let's see if we can make

147
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,883
a peanut butter and honey sandwich.

148
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:28,633
Get a plate and put it
on the table smoothly.

149
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:33,483
I'm gonna see if this is
smooth enough for you guys.

150
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:36,650
(elegant jazzy music)

151
00:07:38,438 --> 00:07:40,157
Was that smooth enough?

152
00:07:40,157 --> 00:07:41,360
(laughing)

153
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,610
And get two piece of bread.

154
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,142
Put down the pieces of bread.

155
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:52,939
You want to bring 'em back.

156
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:55,412
Open the peanut butter,
get a butter knife,

157
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:57,379
scoop up the peanut butter

158
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:59,379
and put it on the bread.

159
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:06,934
- But we said get a
butter knife, excuse me.

160
00:08:08,417 --> 00:08:11,374
- Alright this was my favorite
instruction of theirs.

161
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,869
Squiggle a tiny bit of honey on the bread.

162
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,518
I don't know how to squiggle,

163
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:17,751
but I'm gonna try this.

164
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:19,375
(uptempo dance music)

165
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,042
Squiggle a tiny bit.

166
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:25,391
Spread the peanut butter
and honey together

167
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:28,224
on a piece of bread very smoothly.

168
00:08:30,175 --> 00:08:33,373
(elegant jazzy music)

169
00:08:33,373 --> 00:08:35,181
(laughing)

170
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:38,264
Put the two pieces of bread together.

171
00:08:42,543 --> 00:08:43,985
Alright.
- So bad.

172
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:45,312
- And that's the end.

173
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,587
Did we get a peanut
butter and honey sandwich.

174
00:08:47,587 --> 00:08:49,667
- Hey it actually tastes pretty good.

175
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:53,250
- Get a plate and put
it on the table flat.

176
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:58,264
Get peanut butter and honey.

177
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,226
Put two pieces of bread
on the plate flatly,

178
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,971
but don't push on it,

179
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:06,581
just lay the bread on the plate

180
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:08,748
and put the plate face up.

181
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:11,690
Get the butter knife

182
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,440
and put it into the peanut butter

183
00:09:15,337 --> 00:09:18,559
and move it so it gets
peanut butter on it,

184
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,436
but don't use your hands.

185
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:25,293
(uptempo rock music)

186
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:27,543
(laughing)

187
00:09:28,412 --> 00:09:29,890
With the side of the knife that has

188
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,973
the peanut butter on it, put it down.

189
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,071
(laughing)

190
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:38,782
Move it

191
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:39,615
Hey (laughs).

192
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:41,360
Move it gently across the bread,

193
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,382
on the side of the
bread, but not the crust.

194
00:09:44,382 --> 00:09:46,037
Move it gently.

195
00:09:46,037 --> 00:09:47,037
- Yeah like

196
00:09:48,678 --> 00:09:50,761
No but on top of it yeah.

197
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:54,566
- Open the honey and turn it upside down

198
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,816
over the bread.

199
00:09:59,676 --> 00:10:01,011
Let's read a little further.

200
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:03,088
And just put a little bit of honey.

201
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:07,255
Squeeze the jar just once
for a little bit of time.

202
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,352
(laughing)

203
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,234
Get a piece of bread,

204
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:19,817
like a pan of pizza if
you were a waitress.

205
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,041
Like this?

206
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,880
And put the piece of bread gently

207
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,713
on the bread with the
peanut butter and honey.

208
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:35,584
Alright, is it a peanut
butter and honey sandwich?

209
00:10:35,584 --> 00:10:36,659
Not quite.

210
00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:37,819
Round two was also a fail.

211
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:40,666
This time I'm gonna let
all the kids work together

212
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:42,836
and see if they can give
me exact instructions

213
00:10:42,836 --> 00:10:45,372
to make a peanut butter
and honey sandwich.

214
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:46,508
- Okay we're ready.

215
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:47,795
- Okay you guys ready?

216
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,712
Instruction number one.

217
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,482
Are you feeling nervous?

218
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:56,649
Get the place and put it
smoothly on the table face up.

219
00:11:01,842 --> 00:11:04,493
I guess I could lay down on
the table with my face up,

220
00:11:04,493 --> 00:11:06,427
but that's getting crazy.

221
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:09,344
I'm gonna do this smoothly face up.

222
00:11:10,914 --> 00:11:13,034
(laughing)

223
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:15,129
Number two, get two pieces of bread

224
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:19,416
and put them flat and
gently on top of the plate

225
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,744
but not on top of each other.

226
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:24,577
- We're figuring out your secrets.

227
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:28,521
- Yeah!

228
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,653
(cheering)

229
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:31,035
- Yes Yes!

230
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:33,868
- Alright, open the peanut butter.

231
00:11:35,953 --> 00:11:39,265
Grab the handle of the butter knife

232
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:43,432
and put the butter knife in
with the sharp side down,

233
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,622
then scoop some peanut butter,

234
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,293
and spread it all over
one side of the bread,

235
00:11:49,293 --> 00:11:53,210
not on the crust or the
back side of the bread.

236
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,293
- Ahhhhh.

237
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,627
- Pretty good instructions, honestly.

238
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:06,766
Oh I got a little bit on the crust.

239
00:12:06,766 --> 00:12:10,502
Open the cap of honey and put some honey

240
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:12,835
on top of the peanut butter.

241
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:16,717
- No!

242
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:18,967
(laughing)

243
00:12:19,828 --> 00:12:21,215
- You did it.

244
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:22,313
- You're the one who did it,

245
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:24,602
I just followed the instructions.

246
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:27,435
You guys were so close last round.

247
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:30,395
Do you think you got it this time?

248
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:33,228
(melodious music)

249
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,226
Now you've made some changes.

250
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:38,817
Open the cap of the honey,

251
00:12:38,817 --> 00:12:41,419
and put some honey on top of the bread

252
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,602
that has the peanut butter on it,

253
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:47,050
and only spread it on the peanut butter

254
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,133
on the bread.

255
00:12:52,626 --> 00:12:55,122
(dramatic music)

256
00:12:55,122 --> 00:12:55,955
- Yes!

257
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:06,237
- Let's see if this final
instruction is there.

258
00:13:06,237 --> 00:13:07,896
I don't know if you're gonna get this one.

259
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:10,958
Get the two pieces of bread on the plate

260
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,289
and put them together with
the peanut butter and honey

261
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:18,039
exactly in the middle
of the pieces of bread.

262
00:13:21,405 --> 00:13:22,238
- Yeah!

263
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:25,077
- A peanut butter and honey sandwich!

264
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:27,160
- Thanks, now I'm hungry.

265
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:30,194
- How do you guys feel that
you were able to conquer me

266
00:13:30,194 --> 00:13:31,107
in the Exact Instructions Challenge?

267
00:13:31,107 --> 00:13:32,090
- Good.

268
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,989
- Hive fives.

269
00:13:32,989 --> 00:13:33,822
Boom.

270
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:34,655
- Boom

271
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:35,488
- Boom.

272
00:13:35,488 --> 00:13:36,321
Boom.

273
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,154
And one more time, we'd like to thank

274
00:13:37,154 --> 00:13:39,013
the Ballinger family for
challenging us to do it.

275
00:13:39,013 --> 00:13:39,900
It was a lot of fun.

276
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,888
- [All] J House out.

277
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,632
- [Kendra] You guys want to see what came?

278
00:13:43,632 --> 00:13:45,208
It's all of your Halloween costumes.

279
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:46,291
- [All] Yeah!

280
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:52,415
(Jeremy laughing)

281
00:13:52,415 --> 00:00:00,000
(funky electronic music)
