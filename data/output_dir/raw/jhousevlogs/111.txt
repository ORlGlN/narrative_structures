1
00:00:00,393 --> 00:00:01,468
(crowd cheering)

2
00:00:01,468 --> 00:00:02,337
- Hi guys!

3
00:00:02,337 --> 00:00:03,903
Guys, there's a line outside.

4
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:04,886
- [Jeremy] Look at this.

5
00:00:04,886 --> 00:00:05,902
What!?

6
00:00:05,902 --> 00:00:07,817
Look they made J-House shirts.

7
00:00:07,817 --> 00:00:09,497
How cool is that.

8
00:00:09,497 --> 00:00:12,080
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:18,825 --> 00:00:20,090
- Good morning.

10
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:22,071
Today is the big day for
our service celebration.

11
00:00:22,071 --> 00:00:24,007
And we're excited and a
little bit overwhelmed because

12
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:25,232
we've never done something

13
00:00:25,232 --> 00:00:26,065
like this before.

14
00:00:26,065 --> 00:00:27,884
Hopefully things go smoothly.

15
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,467
(upbeat music)

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,272
- Well we just showed up at
the church where the event

17
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:36,105
is being held.

18
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:37,704
We're like running behind
on a bunch of stuff that

19
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,602
we're trying to get ready and we're super

20
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:41,480
excited about meeting everyone
and getting this going.

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,600
- There are so many people
here helping us today.

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,136
We're getting set up for
the hygiene kits right now.

23
00:00:46,136 --> 00:00:47,616
We're so blessed to be
working with Heart to Heart

24
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,632
International today.

25
00:00:48,632 --> 00:00:49,832
They're like a well oiled machine.

26
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:50,936
They know exactly what
they're doing and they

27
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:53,177
are getting it all set up.

28
00:00:53,177 --> 00:00:56,440
(upbeat music)

29
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,664
I just saw Jeremy for the first time.

30
00:00:57,664 --> 00:00:59,103
He's been busy running around.

31
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:00,560
- Trying to get everything ready.

32
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,393
- [Man] So you start right here,

33
00:01:01,393 --> 00:01:02,226
okay ?

34
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:03,622
Can you grab a bag?

35
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:04,455
Okay.

36
00:01:04,455 --> 00:01:07,865
- [Girl] Wash cloth.
Let's pick up a wash cloth.

37
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:09,368
- [Kendra] Elise is being our tester.

38
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:10,746
[Man] Hand towels.

39
00:01:10,746 --> 00:01:12,321
- [Girl] Hand towels.

40
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:14,090
- [Man] These are instructions
on when you should

41
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,694
wash your hands.

42
00:01:15,694 --> 00:01:16,777
- [Girl] Toothpaste.

43
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,530
[Man] Toothpaste. Let's put
it in flat, okay, sideways.

44
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,363
- [Girl] Shampoo.

45
00:01:19,363 --> 00:01:20,642
- (man) Shampoo.

46
00:01:20,642 --> 00:01:21,475
- [Girl] Toothbrush.

47
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:22,308
- (man) Toothbrush.

48
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:23,141
- [Girl] Comb.

49
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:23,974
Soap.

50
00:01:23,974 --> 00:01:26,249
- (man) Yep, and this is a hard one.

51
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:27,215
- Nail clippers!

52
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,464
- (man) Yes!

53
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:29,547
There you go.

54
00:01:31,416 --> 00:01:32,416
Now seal it.

55
00:01:33,443 --> 00:01:35,634
- [Kendra] Good job 'lise.

56
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:37,466
[Lady] Hi, now what I'm
gonna do is I'm gonna take

57
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:39,826
it and I'm gonna place it in this one.

58
00:01:39,826 --> 00:01:42,112
- [Kendra] And look
'lise, on the bags it says

59
00:01:42,112 --> 00:01:43,470
J House Vlogs.

60
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,361
- [Elise] Oh!

61
00:01:44,361 --> 00:01:46,448
- And then I'm gonna put it over here and

62
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:47,494
it's gonna go in a box.

63
00:01:47,494 --> 00:01:48,556
- Your first.

64
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:50,053
- [Kendra] First one's done.

65
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:50,886
[Man] Yeah!

66
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:51,869
[Kendra] Good job!

67
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:52,852
One down!

68
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,647
Only one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-nine to go.

69
00:01:56,647 --> 00:01:59,322
[Kendra] Extra supplies.

70
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:02,572
(upbeat music playing)

71
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:10,635
- We're sending these to Pico de gallo.

72
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:17,332
- [Kendra] Isaac can't stop dancing today.

73
00:02:17,332 --> 00:02:18,556
(music)

74
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,621
- [Kendra] Nice!

75
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:22,809
- We have a playlist going for this event.

76
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,326
Aunt Julie made it for us and
the kids can't stop dancing.

77
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:25,956
Except for her.

78
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:29,110
She doesn't know what's going on.

79
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,610
(crowd noise)

80
00:02:34,477 --> 00:02:35,977
- [Lady] The balloon!

81
00:02:35,977 --> 00:02:37,485
Look up there.

82
00:02:37,485 --> 00:02:38,402
Nope.

83
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:42,235
(people talking and laughing)

84
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,808
- (lady) We're not very safe but.

85
00:02:46,808 --> 00:02:47,641
OH!

86
00:02:49,048 --> 00:02:49,881
Yeah! Woo!

87
00:02:53,805 --> 00:02:57,029
- So we ordered the cake
half chocolate, half vanilla.

88
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:57,862
But I'm curious.

89
00:02:57,862 --> 00:03:00,205
Poll question, which kind
would you eat if you were here?

90
00:03:00,205 --> 00:03:02,788
(upbeat music)

91
00:03:09,781 --> 00:03:12,092
Laura just got a balloon.

92
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:13,779
- Well she got back her balloon.

93
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:14,892
_(Kendra) Uh-oh, was that the one

94
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:15,725
that lost?
- Yes

95
00:03:15,725 --> 00:03:17,090
- (Kendra) Oh, I didn't
know that was hers!

96
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,432
- We are now tying it to her wrist.

97
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,364
- [Kendra] Very smart.

98
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:22,477
We have the best volunteers! Yeah!

99
00:03:22,477 --> 00:03:23,549
These are my friends.

100
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:24,597
Friends make the best volunteers.

101
00:03:24,597 --> 00:03:25,852
I can't believe they're
helping us with this

102
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,168
ginormous thing.

103
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,918
We have no idea what we're doing.

104
00:03:30,974 --> 00:03:33,548
Jeremy's on audiovisual.

105
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:34,725
Look at him go.

106
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:36,050
(upbeat music)

107
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,177
Jeremy.

108
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:39,601
- Trying to figure this
out the audio won't

109
00:03:39,601 --> 00:03:42,134
play through the TV. The
TV doesn't look good.

110
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:43,142
- (Kendra) You're amazing.

111
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:46,309
(soft tinkling music)

112
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,159
(crowd screaming and cheering)

113
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,992
Hi guys!

114
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:56,268
Guys, there's a line outside.

115
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,652
I am equally nervous that no-one's going

116
00:03:58,652 --> 00:03:59,485
to show up and I'm also
nervous that so many

117
00:03:59,485 --> 00:04:02,193
people come that they don't
fit into the building.

118
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:04,220
Which that's not gonna happen.

119
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,100
I just passed Jeremy running that way and

120
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,476
I'm running this way.

121
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:08,333
We're to the countdown.

122
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,837
I think we've got 10 minutes
to go and a few things

123
00:04:09,837 --> 00:04:11,532
to work out before then.

124
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:13,188
Did you just try to photo bomb me?

125
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:14,021
- Yeah!

126
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:14,854
(Kendra) Ah!

127
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,507
In case your curious the last
thing you do before a meet up

128
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,443
is brush your teeth.

129
00:04:18,444 --> 00:04:19,652
Nobody wants to meet you with bad breath.

130
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:23,068
(music playing)

131
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,237
(people screaming)

132
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:26,298
- [Jeremy] I wanted to Vlog you guys.

133
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,315
Is that okay?

134
00:04:27,315 --> 00:04:28,287
(people cheering)

135
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,357
(Jeremy) Ready to Vlog the line.

136
00:04:30,357 --> 00:04:31,196
Look at this!

137
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,129
(people cheering)

138
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:32,962
What!?

139
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:35,189
What!?

140
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,078
(music)

141
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,477
- [Jeremy] come on in.

142
00:04:39,477 --> 00:04:41,766
Jillian's explaining what
Heart to Heart does and

143
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,405
how we're making the
kits for the people in

144
00:04:43,405 --> 00:04:44,461
Puerto Rico.

145
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:48,769
So we have the first set of
friends coming to meet us.

146
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:49,909
- I'm excited and I'm nervous.

147
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,542
I always get nervous to meet you guys.

148
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:52,375
I don't know why.

149
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,121
So you can tell Jeremy's
been running around.

150
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,027
He's all sweaty.

151
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:56,409
- I get really nervous.

152
00:04:56,409 --> 00:04:57,682
- [Kendra] It happens.

153
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:59,009
He has literally been running up and down

154
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:00,752
these hallways trying to get
all the audio visual stuff

155
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:01,585
to work.

156
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:02,501
It didn't all end up working.

157
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,842
We were supposed to a really cool J-house

158
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,009
trivia game and it didn't happen.

159
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,113
So we'll have to find a
different way to share that

160
00:05:07,113 --> 00:05:08,187
game with you guys because

161
00:05:08,187 --> 00:05:09,595
there were some good questions.

162
00:05:09,595 --> 00:05:10,902
I think we would have stumped you.

163
00:05:10,902 --> 00:05:13,518
- Like what's the name
of the tree in my office?

164
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,166
- Nobody's gonna know that.

165
00:05:15,166 --> 00:05:16,687
People are coming.

166
00:05:16,687 --> 00:05:18,526
(music)

167
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,598
- [Jeremy] These guys
were here I think like

168
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:22,350
an hour before it started.

169
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,238
- Yeah.

170
00:05:23,238 --> 00:05:24,342
- That's dedication.

171
00:05:24,342 --> 00:05:25,438
They made J-House shirts.

172
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:26,798
How cool is that?

173
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:27,974
I love it!

174
00:05:27,974 --> 00:05:29,319
Number one fan. Is that what it says?

175
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,152
- Yeah.

176
00:05:30,152 --> 00:05:32,652
- [Jeremy] Yes! You proved it.

177
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,672
Kendra saw, what's your name?

178
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:37,505
- Noni.

179
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,112
- [Jeremy] Noni has this purse.

180
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,054
- The phone works!

181
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:40,887
- [Jeremy] The phone works.

182
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,003
- [Kendra] This is the coolest thing ever!

183
00:05:42,003 --> 00:05:45,678
- [Jeremy] Stop it. That is so cool.

184
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,566
Now I know what I'm getting

Here's the rock, paper,

00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:15,365
(crowd playing rock, paper, scissors)

197
00:06:15,365 --> 00:06:17,683
- [Jeremy] You guys ready?

198
00:06:17,683 --> 00:06:19,347
Are you a little nervous?

199
00:06:19,347 --> 00:06:20,715
A little bit?

200
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:21,716
What's your strategy?

201
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,187
Do you know what you're
going to do or do you like

202
00:06:23,187 --> 00:06:24,054
wing it?

203
00:06:24,054 --> 00:06:25,715
You've already decided?

204
00:06:25,715 --> 00:06:27,523
I always like wait to the very end.

205
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:29,179
One, two, three.

206
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:31,580

00:06:37,184 --> 00:06:39,934
(crowd laughing)

210
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,670
- Where are you from?

211
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,869
- Spring Valley.

212
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,717
- We really appreciate
you coming and winning.

213
00:06:46,717 --> 00:06:48,541
- The United States of (mumbling)

214
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,541
(music)

215
00:06:51,493 --> 00:06:54,221
- Okay, so there's a twelve
generation set and it says if

216
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:56,013
you want to change the
world go home and love

217
00:06:56,013 --> 00:06:57,325
your family.

218
00:06:57,325 --> 00:06:58,518
And that is something that ... Oh!

219
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,229
(laughing)

220
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,613
- [Jeremy] Or waive randomly.

221
00:07:02,613 --> 00:07:06,117
- That is something that
we're a very imperfect family

222
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:08,701
but we're trying and Jeremy
and I like to try and

223
00:07:08,701 --> 00:07:11,297
remember that some of the
greatest service that we

224
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,001
can do is at home.

225
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:15,540
So let's just all go home
and love on our family.

226
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,123
(upbeat music)

227
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,589
(crowd noise)

228
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:39,024
- What was your name? Ryan?

229
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,116
So cool!

230
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:42,940
- Triplets! They're triplets!

231
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,156
- How old are you?

232
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,011
- [Boy] Eleven.

233
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:46,028
- Eight.

234
00:07:46,028 --> 00:07:46,861
Royals fan?

235
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:47,919
- Yeah.

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,752
- Right.

237
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:51,915
- Hi Kendra! It's good to meet you.

238
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:53,072
I just want to thank
you guys for everything

239
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:54,187
you've done.

240
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:55,515
It's made such a difference in our life.

241
00:07:55,515 --> 00:07:59,736
You're so loved and the
boys love your kids.

242
00:07:59,736 --> 00:08:02,095
- [Jeremy] Landry was
the winner of our rock,

243
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,653
paper, scissors tournament.

244
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:04,486
- Woohoo!

245
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:05,527
- [Kendra] What's your advice?

246
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:06,360
Which is best?

247
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,052
Rock, paper, or scissors?

248
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:08,885
- Rock.

249
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:09,718
- [Jeremy] Rock?

250
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:12,221
- Callie was showing us this doll.

251
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:14,870
Check it out. They're reversible.

252
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:17,022
So one of the things we had up was just a

253
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,438
board that people could write
what they're grateful for.

254
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:19,517
And I love seeing it at the end.

255
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:20,533
It's so beautiful.

256
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,437
Let's see what we can find.

257
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,589
My family.

258
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,151
My loving family.

259
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,711
Can you see that white balloon up there?

260
00:08:28,711 --> 00:08:31,717
That is the second balloon
that Laura has lost.

261
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:32,549
- Third.

262
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:33,676
- [Kendra] Third?

263
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:36,077
Good luck getting that one Thomas.

264
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:38,030
We could not have done this
without all of your help.

265
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,349
Thank you so much.

266
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,850
This is what 1800 hygiene kits

267
00:08:42,797 --> 00:08:43,821
look like.

268
00:08:43,821 --> 00:08:46,309
Headed to Puerto Rico.

269
00:08:46,309 --> 00:08:47,245
- It's amazing.

270
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,909
So we couldn't have done
this event without all of

271
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:50,541
our volunteers. They've been amazing.

272
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,374
[Photographer] Alright, ready?

273
00:08:51,374 --> 00:08:53,957
(upbeat music)

274
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,883
- So I remember when we
had one day without power

275
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,082
and how traumatic that was.

276
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,762
And there's still people in Puerto Rico

277
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,442
who don't have power.

278
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:17,538
It's been weeks and so I'm
grateful that were able to

279
00:09:17,538 --> 00:09:19,209
do something meaningful that is gonna make

280
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:20,042
a difference.

281
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:22,567
These are going to people
in Puerto Rico to help

282
00:09:22,567 --> 00:09:23,774
them out.

283
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:26,191
(Soft music)

284
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:30,096
[Jeremy] Thanks so much for coming!

285
00:09:30,096 --> 00:09:32,096
Look at all the parents.

286
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,173
This is awesome.

287
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,385
(crowd noise)

288
00:09:37,385 --> 00:09:38,785
- So my sister has to leave.

289
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:39,909
- [Jeremy] We're so sad.

290
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,476
You were very helpful.

291
00:09:41,476 --> 00:09:42,584
She was watching Laura
the whole time and Laura

292
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:45,084
was tired through a lot of it.

293
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:48,609
(soft music)

294
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:07,485
- J.

295
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,318
- J.

296
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:09,173
- J.

297
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:10,006
- J.

298
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:10,839
- House.

299
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:11,672
- House.

300
00:10:11,672 --> 00:10:12,505
- House.

301
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:13,338
- House.

302
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:14,171
- House.

303
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:15,004
- House.

304
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:15,837
- House.

305
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:16,670
- House.

306
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,920
- J-House Vlog!

307
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,486
[Kendra] We got my sister Tiffany from the

308
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:21,445
airport!

309
00:10:21,445 --> 00:10:22,621
- Laura's pants.

310
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,438
- Do you want to go swimming?

311
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:28,021
(upbeat music)

312
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,416
Holy splash.

313
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:36,315
So our swim time ended
with a scary moment.

314
00:10:36,315 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
