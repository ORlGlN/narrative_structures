1
00:00:02,671 --> 00:00:05,447
- I got a text from my
sister this afternoon

2
00:00:05,447 --> 00:00:08,455
that my dad was in the ambulance
on the way to the hospital

3
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,381
and that he was having a heart attack.

4
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:14,128
And that is a text that
you never want to get.

5
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:19,053
Anyway, I cried and I called
my sister for more updates

6
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:22,301
and I prayed and I called Jeremy.

7
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:23,259
My dad got to the hospital

8
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:25,360
and they took him right into surgery

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,277
and so he's already out of surgery.

10
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:31,307
I really want to be with
my family right now,

11
00:00:31,307 --> 00:00:33,689
and so Jeremy and I decided that I'm going

12
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:34,740
to head down there for a few days.

13
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,198
So I'm at the airport.

14
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:37,884
Not exactly where I
expected to be this evening,

15
00:00:37,884 --> 00:00:40,077
but I'm grateful that
hopefully tonight I'll get

16
00:00:40,077 --> 00:00:41,110
to see my did in the hospital.

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,748
If not, tomorrow morning.

18
00:00:42,748 --> 00:00:46,915
Jennae and I are headed,
she's my little travel buddy.

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,221
We're going to go see Papa.

20
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:53,638
(soft music)

21
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:08,628
- [Jeremy] So what did mom leave for you?

22
00:01:08,628 --> 00:01:11,461
- A note and it says 'I love you'.

23
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,019
Oh, it actually has that!

24
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,638
- [Jeremy] A little drawing on the back.

25
00:01:16,638 --> 00:01:19,121
So yesterday, when Kendra heard
about her dad's heart attack

26
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,357
we got a plane ticket immediately

27
00:01:21,357 --> 00:01:23,373
and she flew to Arizona in a rush.

28
00:01:23,373 --> 00:01:26,036
But, before she left, show
wrote love notes to all of us.

29
00:01:26,036 --> 00:01:26,933
That was really sweet.

30
00:01:26,933 --> 00:01:28,069
So how did you guys feel when you

31
00:01:28,069 --> 00:01:30,158
heard that Papa had a heart attack?

32
00:01:30,158 --> 00:01:30,991
- I was sad.

33
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:31,856
- Yeah.

34
00:01:31,856 --> 00:01:36,017
- I felt bad for him and wanted
to do something to help him.

35
00:01:36,017 --> 00:01:37,399
- [Jeremy] How did you
feel about it, Elise?

36
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,314
- I cried when I figured it out.

37
00:01:40,314 --> 00:01:41,495
I love Papa.

38
00:01:41,495 --> 00:01:43,512
- [Jeremy] It's sad to think
anything would happen to him.

39
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:46,633
- He taught me to build when I was three.

40
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:50,435
- He was also going to help
me with my Pinewood Derby car.

41
00:01:50,435 --> 00:01:52,288
Because it's coming up soon.

42
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,066
- Papa and Mugga were
planning to come visit us

43
00:01:54,066 --> 00:01:58,226
for about a week right leading
up to our service celebration

44
00:01:58,226 --> 00:02:00,233
and so, we had a bunch of plans with them

45
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:01,973
and they're not going
to be able to come now

46
00:02:01,973 --> 00:02:03,548
so that's also another sad thing now

47
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:06,997
because we love being with them so much.

48
00:02:06,997 --> 00:02:09,239
(soft music)

49
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,190
- [Kendra] Right now, I'm
at grandma and papa's house.

50
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,897
I lived here last night.

51
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,278
- Alone?

52
00:02:15,278 --> 00:02:17,335
- [Kendra] No, grandma's with me.

53
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:18,398
Papa's in the hospital.

54
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:21,310
- Can I say hi to grandma?

55
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,850
- [Kendra] She's still
sleeping because it's

56
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,231
so really early here in Arizona.

57
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,941
- What time is it?

58
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,484
- [Kendra] It is 6:43 and I'm already

59
00:02:28,484 --> 00:02:30,345
showered and dressed for the day.

60
00:02:30,345 --> 00:02:32,165
That's how you know
something is wrong with life.

61
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:33,355
- [Jeremy] Like a time change.

62
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:34,772
- It's 8:43 here.

63
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:37,557
- [Jeremy] There's Nae-nae.

64
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:38,672
Say 'Hi'.

65
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:39,505
- Hi!

66
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:43,823
- What have you been doing so far?

67
00:02:43,823 --> 00:02:45,884
- [Kendra] Well, last night when I flew in

68
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:47,711
I went to the hospital to see Papa

69
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:51,610
and then I came home and I
slept because it was late.

70
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
- Hi, Janae.

71
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:54,979
Hi!

72
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:57,923
Hi, Janae-nae.

73
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:59,433
- [Jeremy] She loves you girls.

74
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,611
- I want to talk to Papa, Mama.

75
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:02,583
- [Kendra] Well, I want
to talk to Papa too.

76
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,777
He's at the hospital and
I'm at his house right now.

77
00:03:04,777 --> 00:03:08,048
I just took a shower so I can go see him.

78
00:03:08,048 --> 00:03:10,631
(upbeat music)

79
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:25,019
I just ran to the store.

80
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:26,710
I'm grabbing some magazine for my dad

81
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,155
because let's face it, sitting in the

82
00:03:28,155 --> 00:03:29,612
hospital can get really boring.

83
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:30,749
Hopefully he likes it.

84
00:03:30,749 --> 00:03:31,977
I figure anything has to be better

85
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,178
than just like the medication pamphlets

86
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,728
that are just sitting
around and other boring

87
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:37,435
stuff there is to read
and do at the hospital.

88
00:03:37,435 --> 00:03:39,626
I'm also getting lunch for everybody.

89
00:03:39,626 --> 00:03:40,574
Which I'm getting from?

90
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:41,407
Can you guess?

91
00:03:41,407 --> 00:03:42,240
Can you guess?

92
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,083
Here's a hint, I'm in Arizona.

93
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:44,916
Zupas!

94
00:03:46,704 --> 00:03:49,287
(upbeat music)

95
00:03:51,054 --> 00:03:52,540
- It's interesting with Kendra being gone

96
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,757
you appreciate more the stuff
that she does all the time

97
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,122
that I often don't thing about.

98
00:03:57,122 --> 00:04:00,402
Little things like she
makes our bed every day.

99
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,324
Have you ever noticed that?

100
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,381
If your mom is sick or
gone or your dad is gone

101
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:06,385
you then can see and appreciate the

102
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:08,866
things that you miss about them.

103
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,467
We are missing Kendra.

104
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:14,134
(piano playing)

105
00:04:25,596 --> 00:04:28,040
(upbeat music)

106
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,582
- [Jeremy] Whoa!

107
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:31,089
(laughing)

108
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,339
That's a little bit better.

109
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:36,106
Nice!

110
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:40,432
I love and respect papa so much.

111
00:04:40,432 --> 00:04:43,727
It so scary and sad to think
that anything can happen to him

112
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,789
and we just are praying for his

113
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:49,510
recovery and for high spirits and we want

114
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,266
to continue to think and do anything

115
00:04:51,266 --> 00:04:54,599
we can to show him our love and support.

116
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:58,505
(adventurous music)

117
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,959
(leaves shuffling)

118
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:10,965
(upbeat music)

119
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:33,846
- Well I know you guys all
have been really worried about

120
00:05:33,846 --> 00:05:36,443
Papa just like I was and I
have to say it makes my heart

121
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:38,846
feel so much better to be
able to be here and to see him

122
00:05:38,846 --> 00:05:41,364
because he is feeling
well and he's doing well.

123
00:05:41,364 --> 00:05:44,042
He still has things hooked
up all over his body

124
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,589
assessing his heart and trying to

125
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:48,915
see what the future
holds for him with like

126
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,398
what other treatments he'll need and stuff

127
00:05:50,398 --> 00:05:52,154
but he's doing such much better.

128
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:53,799
We're really happy to see you.

129
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:54,728
- Doing good.

130
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,264
It's good to feel alive and good.

131
00:05:57,264 --> 00:05:58,931
- Yes, it is good.

132
00:05:58,931 --> 00:05:59,764
I'm always so impressed.

133
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:02,213
My dad has a great sense
of humor and no matter

134
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:05,579
what's going on, I feel he
sees some fun and joy in it.

135
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:07,223
And it's really fun to
just be here and visit

136
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:08,564
and now unfortunately we have to

137
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:09,699
go put Janae down for a nap so we're

138
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,204
going to leave for a little bit.

139
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,951
But we got him some good reading material.

140
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,784
- I've got plenty to do.

141
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:14,788
Kendra took good care of me.

142
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:15,621
- [Kendra] There we go.

143
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:17,188
Before I jumped on the
plane, the kids had a chance

144
00:06:17,188 --> 00:06:19,909
to make Papa some cards to
say that they loved him.

145
00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:21,233
So I gave him...

146
00:06:21,233 --> 00:06:22,160
- All kinds of cards.

147
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,673
I've got more cards than
kids so they must of...

148
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:26,506
- [Kendra] They had fun with it.

149
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:27,621
- Yeah, they got in to it.

150
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,510
Issac, yeah.

151
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,647
- [Kendra] We got this one
from Issac, the cabins.

152
00:06:31,647 --> 00:06:32,480
Elise.

153
00:06:33,468 --> 00:06:36,989
- And I think Laura
was practicing her L's.

154
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:37,822
- [Kendra] She was.

155
00:06:37,822 --> 00:06:40,122
Do you want to read them one
of the funny ones that she did?

156
00:06:40,122 --> 00:06:43,385
- I hope you have a great
time at the hospital.

157
00:06:43,385 --> 00:06:44,218
(giggling)

158
00:06:44,218 --> 00:06:45,076
You're good at it.

159
00:06:45,076 --> 00:06:47,543
Now, don't get sick anymore.

160
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,376
L.

161
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:49,214
- [Kendra] Awesome!

162
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,359
So that was exactly what Laura said.

163
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,537
And then she signed it.

164
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,002
Well you're great at the hospital, dad.

165
00:06:54,002 --> 00:06:54,835
- Yeah, thanks.

166
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:55,879
- [Kendra] Now don't get sick anymore!

167
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,712
- No!

168
00:06:56,712 --> 00:06:58,436
- So the house is quiet this afternoon.

169
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,269
Janae is napping and we just came home

170
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,524
from the hospital a little bit

171
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:04,086
to give her a little bit of a rest.

172
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:06,818
I'm just having a chance
to sit here and think

173
00:07:06,818 --> 00:07:08,881
and what I'm thinking
of and what I'm feeling

174
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:11,330
is just an immense amount
of love for my dad.

175
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,303
I'm so grateful for the man he is.

176
00:07:14,303 --> 00:07:17,778
I'm so grateful for
modern medicine and the

177
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:21,252
treatment he's received and
the technology that their

178
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,278
using now to try to do further testing

179
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:26,301

180
00:07:26,301 --> 00:07:29,448
I'm just so grateful that
he's still here with us today.

181
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:33,196

phone call yesterday

182
00:07:33,196 --> 00:07:36,497
I Just love my dad a lot

183
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,414

184
00:07:40,514 --> 00:07:42,203
Trying to put my trust in God and

185
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:44,821
have optimism of all that is ahead.

186
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:48,677
Well, Janae is loving having
a new place to explore.

187
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,549
You having fun at grandma's house?

188

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,536
That's a lot of talking.

190
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:03,277

- [Elise] Good.

221
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:08,691

222
00:09:08,691 --> 00:09:10,178
Do you remember doing them?

223
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,255
- [Elise] Yeah!

224
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:12,398
- [Kendra] Do you guys know that Papa

225
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:14,993
has lot's of cords hooked
up to him right now?

226
00:09:14,993 --> 00:09:15,953
- No.

227
00:09:15,953 --> 00:09:17,851
- [Kendra] They're hacking,
do you want to see?

228
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:19,215
All those things are monitoring his

229
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,376
heart on this monitor up here.

230
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:24,209
- How did your heart attack start?

231
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:26,524
- [Papa] They call it plaque but it's like

232
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,592
a little piece of skin and it makes

233
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:31,549
so like a traffic jam
nothing can get past it.

234
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:32,417
- [Jeremy] Can you guys say goodnight?

235
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,340
We have to go pick up Isaac.

236
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,173
- Goodnight.

237
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:38,006
- Can you show Papa my silly face?

238
00:09:39,468 --> 00:09:42,540
- [Papa] Whoa, that is (?)

239
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,934
- Goodnight!

240
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:44,767

241
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,345
- We got to go pick up Isaac from violin.

242
00:09:46,345 --> 00:09:47,811
I'm sad he missed that call but

243
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:49,949
we'll call back Papa again soon for Isaac.

244
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,387
Thanks so much for supporting
our family during this time.

245
00:09:53,387 --> 00:09:54,370
We're all scared for Papa.

246
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,042

- I'm making a house.

251
00:10:04,282 --> 00:10:06,865
(upbeat music)

252
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:10,710
- [Kendra] What is going on?

253
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,359
- I'm going to make a pumpkin patch.

00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:14,220
I got my first side done.
