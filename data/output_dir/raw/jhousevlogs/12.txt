1
00:00:02,075 --> 00:00:04,908
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,908 --> 00:00:05,750
- [Kendra] So Janae is shall we call

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,153
it helping fold laundry.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,983
- Destroying.

5
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:12,855
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:19,903
- [Kendra] Did you find some bowls?

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,943
Good find.

8
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:25,649
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,414
Good job.

10
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:39,247
Well I'm really bummed.

11
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,930
All winter long we've been wanting

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,105
to take the kids ice skating

13
00:00:43,105 --> 00:00:44,410
and we just haven't made the time for it.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,080
Anyway, with it being March we were like,

15
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,560
we've got to schedule this soon.

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,340
So we scheduled it and today's the day

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,820
we're gonna go ice skating.

18
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,300
I just called and the
rink is not open today

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,040
because we're having one
of those crazy warm days.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,520
We're in the type of
springtime when some days

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,670
are cold still and some days are warm.

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,709
So today the ice rink is closed.

23
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:06,500
Lesson learned though, if
something's important to you,

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,205
just do it, don't wait.

25
00:01:08,205 --> 00:01:10,313
Janae are you helping with the laundry?

26
00:01:12,548 --> 00:01:13,383
Are you gonna fold that one?

27
00:01:14,777 --> 00:01:19,090
So Janae is shall we call
it helping fold laundry.

28
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,490
- No, destroying.

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,970
- So I don't really have a laundry day

30
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,780
but today I'm doing like
four loads of laundry.

31
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,980
So I guess today is laundry day.

32
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,733
The kids are helping fold and Janae

33
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:30,270
is wanting to be involved.

34
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,230
Go for it girl, fold it.

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,713
You folding sister's pants?

36
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,410
Good job.

37
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,920
Bring me another one, I'll fold it.

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,003
There we go.

39
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,853
Nope.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,080
So we decided to take advantage
of the pretty weather today

41
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,915
and hit up the park.

42
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:48,498
(upbeat music)

43
00:01:54,785 --> 00:01:55,750
Apparently the kids have made some sort

44
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,163
of an obstacle course.

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,843
You watching everybody?

46
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,622
Yay, you're cheering for them?

47
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:08,020
She's like, how do I do that?

48
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,603
(upbeat music)

49
00:02:17,146 --> 00:02:19,793
Janae does not know what
to make of the wood chips.

50
00:02:19,793 --> 00:02:20,626
What is this?

51
00:02:20,626 --> 00:02:22,765
Climb on up here.

52
00:02:22,765 --> 00:02:23,972
Going up.

53
00:02:23,972 --> 00:02:24,805
Whoa!

54
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:26,550
So we're playing with friends at the park

55
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,560
but the main attraction
isn't the playground.

56
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,054
It's the tree with the sticks
and the dirt and the wood.

57
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:34,810
- Good job, how about this one?

58
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,060
You know these two notes.

59
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:39,403
- One, two, three, four, five.

60
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,968
- It's a fifth.

61
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:43,198
- It's a fifth, exactly.

62
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:45,698
(piano music)

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,900
- [Kendra] This girl is such a big girl.

64
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,240
She eats real food these days.

65
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,040
She's having some leftover
pasta, grapes, veggies.

66
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,730
- Exactly what we had.

67
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,860
- [Kendra] Exactly
'cause she's a big girl.

68
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,130
So at lunch today we had
an interesting discussion

69
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,600
as a family about
expectations and happiness.

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,420
And how our expectations of something

71
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,100
can affect our happiness.

72
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,040
Like if we have these
really high expectations

73
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,480
then we might be easily disappointed.

74
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,031
But if we have really low
expectation, we're easily happy

75
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,370
or do we go into it with a bad attitude

76
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,290
'cause we're just expecting
it to be miserable.

77
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,900
We've just been talking
a lot about expectations

78
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,650
and healthy expectations and hope.

79
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,918
And kind of how all of these
affect our happiness in life.

80
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:31,335
(rock music)

81
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,101
Blow kisses.

82
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:50,190
So Laura just walked by
getting a drink of water

83
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,390
and blew a kiss to Janae
and Janae blew a kiss back.

84
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,683
It just melted my heart.

85
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,850
- So I did my own ponytail
for my first time.

86
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,340
- [Kendra] Oh, let's see it.

87
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,628
That looks really nice Laura.

88
00:04:06,628 --> 00:04:07,461
- Thank you.

89
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:08,764
- [Kendra] Where are you going?

90
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:09,878
You're dressed up so nice.

91
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:12,630
- I'm going to the gym with Mom

92
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,823
to play with Brittany.

93
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:16,264
- [Kendra] To play with
your friend at the gym.

94
00:04:16,264 --> 00:04:18,656
Well you definitely look nice for the gym.

95
00:04:18,656 --> 00:04:21,156
(jazzy music)

96
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,521
- I thought I'd bring the kids with me off

97
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,913
to work today while
Kendra went to workout.

98
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:34,701
- I am doing stuff.

99
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,396
- [Jeremy] Are you lawyering?

100
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,229
- There's a secret drawer under here.

101
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:38,860
- [Jeremy] You found the secret drawer?

102
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,410
What did you find Isaac?

103
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,920
- I found an 1994 road atlas.

104
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,447
- [Jeremy] That's probably the
most exciting thing we have.

105
00:04:48,447 --> 00:04:51,030
(upbeat music)

106
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:54,923
So are you lawyering?

107
00:04:54,923 --> 00:04:56,843
- Yep, okay let's read this.

108
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,360
- [Jeremy] So after spending
some time at the office,

109
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,981
I wanted to bring the kids on
a little business field trip.

110
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:05,940
(upbeat music)

111
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,980
- What's Facebook advertising?

112
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,690
- [Jeremy] We are gonna go
learn all about it okay?

113
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,880
Alright, so this is Tom.

114
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,920
He's a friend of mine
from church actually.

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,790
He does some Facebook advertising

116
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,448
and he's gonna teach us about it.

117
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:21,033
- So it looks like you
already have a business page?

118
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,461
(upbeat music)

119
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:25,453
You comfy over there Elise?

120
00:05:26,504 --> 00:05:28,320
- Are there any sports websites stuff?

121
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,200
- Absolutely.

122
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,102
- [Jeremy] There's all kinds of

123
00:05:31,102 --> 00:05:31,935
advertisements in social media.

124
00:05:31,935 --> 00:05:32,970
So we're talking to the kids about how you

125
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,570
can start a business over
anything you're interested in.

126
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,310
You can make a product and
then you can create that thing

127
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,413
and get it out through marketing.

128
00:05:40,413 --> 00:05:42,480
Well there's legal sides of it

129
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,500
but really the most important thing is

130
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,630
that you have something
of value that you can sell

131
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,565
to people who wanna buy it.

132
00:05:47,565 --> 00:05:48,540
That's a company.

133
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,538
- I wanna make a company.

134
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:51,690
- [Jeremy] You wanna make
a business or a product?

135
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,210
I was grabbing something out of the fridge

136
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,620
and a whole thing of
potatoes fell on the floor.

137
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,060
So I gotta try to clean
it up before Nae-nae

138
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,187
tries to eat it all.

139
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,480
So I'm doing more days of this cleanse.

140
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,780
What I really like about it is that

141
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,800
it's not a starvation plan.

142
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,040
There's still a lot of
calories, there's salads

143
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,230
and a protein ball.

144
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:16,497
It's just really, really healthy eating.

145
00:06:16,497 --> 00:06:19,247
(baby screaming)

146
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:27,875
We're at the point where it's hard for

147
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,080
any of us to communicate with each other

148
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,080
'cause Nae-nae has something to say.

149
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,025
(rock music)

150
00:06:38,602 --> 00:06:39,554
- Oh boy.

151
00:06:39,554 --> 00:06:40,460
- [Jeremy] What are you kiddos doing?

152
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,820
- We're doing gymnastics.

153
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,803
- [Jeremy] Just working on your skills.

154
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,723
- My gymnastics is belly flops.

155
00:06:47,147 --> 00:06:49,564
(rock music)

156
00:06:54,043 --> 00:06:55,490
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

157
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,223
- The treasure hunt is ready.

158
00:06:58,223 --> 00:00:00,000
(orchestral music)
