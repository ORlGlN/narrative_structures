1
00:00:00,822 --> 00:00:02,317
- So these shirts are dyed in chocolate.

2
00:00:02,317 --> 00:00:04,385
(kids laughing)

3
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:05,524
- Donuts!

4
00:00:05,524 --> 00:00:07,187
- [Paul] Should we go get some donuts too?

5
00:00:07,187 --> 00:00:08,020
- Yeah!

6
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,603
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:15,277
- Pop-Tart donuts, this is half of it.

8
00:00:15,277 --> 00:00:18,027
(family yelling)

9
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:22,551
- So we're getting ready
to head out this morning

10
00:00:22,551 --> 00:00:25,449
to do a little shopping
and I asked the kids

11
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:27,593
if they know what a souvenir is.

12
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:29,364
- [Paul] Well first you
asked us how to spell it.

13
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,366
- I did.

14
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:31,765
- [Paul] And we all tried
and all got it wrong.

15
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,182
- I knew how to spell it but nobody else.

16
00:00:34,182 --> 00:00:35,822
So we're learning how to
spell the word souvenir.

17
00:00:35,822 --> 00:00:38,356
- Paul question, how do you think

18
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:39,573
is the correct spelling of souvenir?

19
00:00:39,573 --> 00:00:41,873
I'll put some answers up here.

20
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:43,612
Don't google it first, that's cheating.

21
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,865
And the word of the day is -

22
00:00:45,865 --> 00:00:46,782
- Souvenir!

23
00:00:47,786 --> 00:00:48,788
- Like Sesame Street.

24
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:50,271
- So let's ask Laura first.

25
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:52,062
Laura, what is a souvenir?

26
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:54,222
- It is a pretty elephant.

27
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:57,345
- A pretty elephant,
Caleb what's a souvenir?

28
00:00:57,345 --> 00:00:58,343
- I don't know.

29
00:00:58,343 --> 00:00:59,382
- Lisey's raising her hand.

30
00:00:59,382 --> 00:01:01,847
- It's something that goes
under water that people

31
00:01:01,847 --> 00:01:03,685
discovered new animals.

32
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:05,093
(Paul laughs)

33
00:01:05,093 --> 00:01:07,475
- That's a very specific answer.

34
00:01:07,475 --> 00:01:11,103
- A souvenir is something that you, like,

35
00:01:11,103 --> 00:01:15,422
can get in places like
a picture from San Diego

36
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,058
or something like that.

37
00:01:17,058 --> 00:01:19,147
- [Paul] It's like a memento
to remember the place by?

38
00:01:19,147 --> 00:01:20,146
- Mmhmm.

39
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,924
- [Paul] Like our San Diego Zoo
picture with the Bellingers.

40
00:01:22,924 --> 00:01:24,756
There's a souvenir.

41
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:27,054
- So that's a Legoland souvenir.

42
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:29,538
What would you guys think of
learning how to spell the word

43
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:31,701
souvenir and going to
get a souvenir today?

44
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,997
- [Paul] The I, R at the
end totally threw me off.

45
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:36,222
- Donuts!

46
00:01:36,222 --> 00:01:37,486
- [Paul] Should we go get some donuts too?

47
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:38,486
- Yeah!

48
00:01:38,486 --> 00:01:39,697
- [Paul] So Mom had
everyone write souvenir,

49
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:43,532
and even Laura is writing
her version of souvenir.

50
00:01:43,532 --> 00:01:47,796
♪ Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, ♪

51
00:01:47,796 --> 00:01:50,792
♪ Connecitcut, doo doo
doo, Delaware, Florida, ♪

52
00:01:50,792 --> 00:01:52,057
♪ Hawaii and Idaho ♪

53
00:01:52,057 --> 00:01:55,139
(singing sped up)

54
00:01:55,139 --> 00:01:57,722
(holding note)

55
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:12,483
- [Woman] Well this is getting.

56
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:15,233
- (holding note)

57
00:02:19,017 --> 00:02:20,016
- [Woman] He's gonna pass out,

58
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:21,785
good thing we weren't driving.

59
00:02:21,785 --> 00:02:23,427
Well I can't escape, but I'll put you guys

60
00:02:23,427 --> 00:02:24,604
out of this misery.

61
00:02:24,604 --> 00:02:26,131
So we heard about a legendary donut shop

62
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,102
here in San Diego so we had
to come down and try it.

63
00:02:28,102 --> 00:02:29,865
Apparently they have bacon donuts.

64
00:02:29,865 --> 00:02:32,448
(upbeat music)

65
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:43,299
- These are serious donuts.

66
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:58,852
- I want a pink one.

67
00:02:58,852 --> 00:02:59,852
Like these ones.

68
00:02:59,852 --> 00:03:01,769
- She got the pink one.

69
00:03:02,695 --> 00:03:04,096
- I'm gonna do the strawberry split.

70
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,679
That looks amazing.

71
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,419
- I want coconut green.

72
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,252
- Mud pie.

73
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,904
So now we just have to pay.

74
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:13,737
- I want creme brulee.

75
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:18,121
- You guys made some great choices.

76
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:30,207
- We all want to try all the flavors,

77
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,519
so we're gonna cut them up.

78
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,507
- [Paul] Who's excited?

79
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:33,340
- Me!

80
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:39,022
- Hard caramelized
topping on creme brulee.

81
00:03:42,644 --> 00:03:43,477
- Mhm.

82
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:52,190
- I thought it would be like soft caramel.

83
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,430
- So they're known for
these huge Pop-Tart donuts.

84
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,013
This is half of it.

85
00:04:00,218 --> 00:04:02,272
Somebody knows what the good stuff is.

86
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,979
I'm a little embarrassed
between the six of us,

87
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:04,958
well seven of us,

88
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,937
we completely finished off this donuts.

89
00:04:06,937 --> 00:04:08,705
Jeremy's actually ordering
a few to take home

90
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:10,186
because donuts, if you didn't know,

91
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:11,597
are one of Jeremy's love languages,

92
00:04:11,597 --> 00:04:14,047
and these are good donuts.

93
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:16,654
They're like little ducklings
following behind Jeremy,

94
00:04:16,654 --> 00:04:17,658
it's really cute.

95
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:19,248
Yesterday I was honestly really grumpy.

96
00:04:19,248 --> 00:04:22,448
I just, grr, everything was irritating me.

97
00:04:22,448 --> 00:04:25,904
And this morning I woke up still
feeling a little bit grumpy

98
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:26,987
and I prayed.

99
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:29,796
And I said, God, take these
feelings from my heart.

100
00:04:29,796 --> 00:04:32,349
Like I don't wanna be
irritated with my kids.

101
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:34,154
I want to be able to enjoy this.

102
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:35,412
Like life is good.

103
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,337
I just feel irritated.

104
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:38,974
I just felt immediately this calm,

105
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,187
that just said Kendra,

106
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:41,499
remember to be positive.

107
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:42,653
Look for the good. It's there.

108
00:04:42,653 --> 00:04:44,232
And I've been really focusing
today on being positive

109
00:04:44,232 --> 00:04:46,232
and it's helped so much.

110
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,423
- You're a cute one.

111
00:04:58,604 --> 00:05:00,371
- So we came down to Seaport
Village where there's just

112
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,573
a bunch of fun shops.

113
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:02,933
We're walking around.

114
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:04,197
- So here's one from the zoo.

115
00:05:04,197 --> 00:05:06,329
This one says La Jolla.

116
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,500
- Is there any that says Pacifica?

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,068
- Look, there's sand castles.

118
00:05:10,068 --> 00:05:11,067
- Whoa.

119
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,234
- Three, four.

120
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:15,143
So the kids are picking
out post cards to send

121
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:17,188
to their friends.

122
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:18,506
- [Paul] Seeing snow globes.

123
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,506
- I love it.

124
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,338
So this place is Cupcake Wars champion.

125
00:05:33,338 --> 00:05:36,421
We had to come admire their cupcakes.

126
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,502
- [Paul] Smellable shirts.

127
00:05:48,502 --> 00:05:50,425
- So these shirts are dyed in chocolate.

128
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:51,642
- Are they kids shirts?

129
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,007
- Yeah there are kids shirts.

130
00:05:54,007 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh so when they get wet designs show up.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,282
Whatcha playing?

132
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:00,895
- Solitaire.

133
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:03,562
- [Woman] It's a good game, huh?

134
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:09,328
- Left. Left. Right.

135
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:13,210
Those are opposites.

136
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:19,609
- Well the kids and I are headed to a park

137
00:06:19,609 --> 00:06:21,157
to play with some friends this afternoon.

138
00:06:21,157 --> 00:06:23,682
And Siri was taken me to two wrong places.

139
00:06:23,682 --> 00:06:25,028
First we ended up in a neighborhood,

140
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:26,877
and I tried Googling a different location,

141
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:28,650
and now I'm in the
middle of a parking lot.

142
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,131
And its says, you've arrived, I'm like,

143
00:06:30,131 --> 00:06:31,344
this is not a park.

144
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:32,374
This is a parking lot. So.

145
00:06:32,374 --> 00:06:33,723
Hopefully my friend
can give me directions.

146
00:06:33,723 --> 00:06:36,392
- One of the amazing things
about owning your own businesses

147
00:06:36,392 --> 00:06:39,240
is that you can work from wherever.

148
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,401
And so we're not really on
vacation here in San Diego,

149
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,722
we're just doing the work that
I normally do at home, here.

150
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:45,539
Because I'm mobile.

151
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,488
But for example, today, while
the kids are at the park,

152
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,146
I earlier had a phone call
with a nonprofit board

153
00:06:50,146 --> 00:06:52,554
of directors and I'm
advising them about terms

154
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:53,991
of service and some fair use things,

155
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:56,061
and so I'm preparing a response to that.

156
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,166
- we successfully found the park.

157
00:06:58,166 --> 00:07:00,936
It was hidden behind the grocery store.

158
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:02,775
It was like you had to drive
through the parking lot

159
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:03,958
and it wound around.

160
00:07:03,958 --> 00:07:05,125
It was unique.

161
00:07:12,738 --> 00:07:13,797
- So the best part about
coming to the park today

162
00:07:13,797 --> 00:07:15,435
is that we're meeting up with friends.

163
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,509
My friends name is Heidi.

164
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,284
Her YouTube channel is
While They Were Napping.

165
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:19,552
And she had four little kids

166
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:20,570
and they home school.

167
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,826
So I'm just excited that the
kids get to play with friends

168
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:25,319
and we get to chat, makes for good days.

169
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,048
- I actually got a really
sad email this morning

170
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,071
from a family who watches our vlogs.

171
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:31,438
And they were in a very
serious car accident.

172
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:32,972
How to be life flighted.

173
00:07:32,972 --> 00:07:34,966
Her boy was thrown from the vehicle,

174
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:36,778
she was pregnant at the time.

175
00:07:36,778 --> 00:07:38,442
They had other children in the car

176
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:39,597
that were taken by ambulance.

177
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:41,881
The mom was reaching out
about some legal advice.

178
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,175
And so I'm gonna be contacting her today.

179
00:07:44,175 --> 00:07:46,244
One of the things I love
about being a lawyer

180
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:48,358
is being able to be a friend

181
00:07:48,358 --> 00:07:50,411
and to listen to people and to help them

182
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:51,738
when they're going through
a really hard time.

183
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:53,549
I honestly don't think I would be happier

184
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:55,582
if I didn't have any work to do.

185
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:57,709
Because I love working. I love my job.

186
00:07:57,709 --> 00:08:00,209
- Just relaxing. This is cool.

187
00:08:01,498 --> 00:08:02,668
She loves dogs.

188
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:03,501
Woo!

189
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:09,484
I realize that they're fountain is a lion.

190
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:11,773
It's a drinking fountain.

191
00:08:11,773 --> 00:08:13,959
- I love these kinds of climbing things,

192
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,292
they are so fun.

193
00:08:17,239 --> 00:08:19,115
Dude, you're a monkey up there.

194
00:08:19,115 --> 00:08:20,555
So Isaac is all the way at the top.

195
00:08:20,555 --> 00:08:21,805
Good job Caleb.

196
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:25,901
You saying hi?

197
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,734
So this thing is cool.

198
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:34,006
Wow, that balance, you're
doing awesome, Caleb.

199
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,510
So Jenae just let go,

200
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,731
and I thought for a second she was gonna

201
00:08:36,731 --> 00:08:37,730
take her first step,

202
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,729
and then she held back on.

203
00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:39,889
But it was so close.

204
00:08:39,889 --> 00:08:43,222
She's gonna start walking any day, guys.

205
00:08:46,122 --> 00:08:48,351
You are so stinking grown up.

206
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:51,434
- So I'm doing this color mix sample.

207
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,898
And I'm making black things.

208
00:08:54,898 --> 00:08:57,515
It's ready to get it
all black for tomorrow.

209
00:08:57,515 --> 00:09:00,388
So then it can dry, dry, dry.

210
00:09:00,388 --> 00:09:03,119
- So when we decided to
come stay in a rental house

211
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:04,937
for a month, at first I
was a little bit nervous

212
00:09:04,937 --> 00:09:06,017
that the kids would get bored

213
00:09:06,017 --> 00:09:07,574
because we wouldn't have
any of their toys with them.

214
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:10,636
But I've been surprised at how
well it's been going so far.

215
00:09:10,636 --> 00:09:12,792
We purchased a few small things.

216
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:15,691
Things like paint and
colored pencils and Play-Doh.

217
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,694
Stuff that you can like
really get creative and do

218
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:18,934
a lot of different things with.

219
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,811
We also had to get a
football and a basketball.

220
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:22,494
And with just those few things,

221
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:24,120
the kids have actually done really well.

222
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,261
It also helped that the
house that we're staying at

223
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,351
had a few games,

224
00:09:27,351 --> 00:09:28,908
so we had like chess and checkers.

225
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:30,335
It kind of makes me wanna go home

226
00:09:30,335 --> 00:09:32,145
and clean through our stuff because

227
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,938
we really don't need as much as we have.

228
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,971
Anyway, it's actually
gone surprisingly well.

229
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:37,645
The thing that we miss the most from home

230
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,395
is our library books.

231
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,092
Woo! So close.

232
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:47,590
Did you find your way outside to play?

233
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,423
You just think you can just dance.

234
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,549
Here's dinner tonight.

235
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:56,347
We're having pulled pork, corn on the cob,

236
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:58,760
salad, and french fries.

237
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,759
You guys hungry?

238
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,089
- Yeah.

239
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,896
- [Woman] Lets eat.

240
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,146
You're praying?

241
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:07,891
Okay, you don't wanna
wait for everybody else?

242
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:10,224
- [Paul] She's so spiritual.

243
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,285
- This is Janae's trick.

244
00:10:15,285 --> 00:10:16,629
And we find it hilarious.

245
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,641
- But that's what Caleb did.

246
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:20,681
- [Woman] Caleb did
this when he was a baby.

247
00:10:20,681 --> 00:10:22,235
- So we recorded some of the NFL games

248
00:10:22,235 --> 00:10:24,165
that happened this
Sunday and we're finally

249
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,404
getting the chance to watch some of them.

250
00:10:26,404 --> 00:10:28,339
So who's going to the Super Bowl you guys?

251
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:29,338
- Eagles.

252
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:30,337
- Patriots.

253
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:31,339
- [Paul] Patriots and Eagles.

254
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,891
- Elise and I have been playing
some card games together

255
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:35,194
in the evening, and she is getting good.

256
00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:37,390
- And good at shuffling.

257
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,366
- Yeah, she's been
practicing shuffling. Ready?

258
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,366
Jacks. Twos.

259
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:43,376
- Threes.

260
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:44,761
- Good job.

261
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:45,760
- Ten.

262
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,760
- Oops.

263
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,046
- Queens.

264
00:10:48,046 --> 00:10:49,527
- Goodnight, J house out.

265
00:10:49,527 --> 00:10:51,288
- Wanna make something amazing?

266
00:10:51,288 --> 00:10:52,713
- Isn't it crazy soft?

267
00:10:52,713 --> 00:10:53,730
Did you make a hammock?

268
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,563
- Yeah.

269
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:00,577
- It's really fun.

270
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:02,600
It's this amazing fort.

271
00:11:02,600 --> 00:00:00,000
- So mango tart for dessert.
