1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,784
- [Jeremy] We're gonna go see Granny Jo.

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:03,583
We're gonna go see Papa Keith.

3
00:00:03,583 --> 00:00:07,590
It's gonna be so much fun,
you just can't believe it.

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,600
We're gonna go see Granny Jo.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,352
We're gonna go see Papa Keith.

6
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:15,895
It's gonna be so much fun,
I just can't believe it.

7
00:00:15,895 --> 00:00:18,478
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,237
- We are on our way to
the airport to pick up...

9
00:00:25,237 --> 00:00:28,598
- [All Kids] Granny Joe and Papa Keith!

10
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:30,330
- [Kendra] And whose Mom is that?

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,163
- Dads!

12
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:33,849
- So we are on our way to the airport,

13
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:35,266
in case you didn't catch that,

14
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:38,032
to pick up Granny Jo, and Papa Keith.

15
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:40,265
Which is Jeremy's Mom and Step Dad.

16
00:00:40,265 --> 00:00:41,098
And we're so excited.

17
00:00:41,098 --> 00:00:42,926
They're gonna be here for
a few days visiting us.

18
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:45,195
We're gonna have lots of epic fun.

19
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:46,362
Here they are!

20
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:50,397
We're pulling over, yay!

21
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:52,525
- Hello!

22
00:00:52,525 --> 00:00:54,474
- [ Kendra] Thank you for
coming, we're so excited!

23
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:55,307
Where's Mom?

24
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,676
Guys who's here?

25
00:00:56,676 --> 00:00:57,663
- Granny Joe!

26
00:00:57,663 --> 00:00:59,700
- [Kendra] Granny Jo, yay!

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,832
We're excited to see you!

28
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:02,006
- [Granny Jo] Look at Papa Keith,

29
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,973
look at Elise has cowgirl boots.

30
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:05,906
- Those are cool.

31
00:01:05,906 --> 00:01:07,260
- [Kendra] And she curled
her hair with curlers

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,622
to be just like Granny Jo today.

33
00:01:09,622 --> 00:01:10,942
For some reason.

34
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:12,127
She was so excited.

35
00:01:12,127 --> 00:01:13,328
- Did you remember that
I had my little curlers

36
00:01:13,328 --> 00:01:16,119
that I always put my hair in?

37
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:20,227
Hi Caleb, this is the first
time I've got to hold you.

38
00:01:20,227 --> 00:01:21,285
- [Jeremy] Hi, mom.

39
00:01:21,285 --> 00:01:22,118
- Hi.

40
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:22,951
- [Jeremy] It's good to see ya.

41
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:23,784
- I like your beard.

42
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:24,661
- [Jeremy] Thanks.

43
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,919
- It looks good on you.
- [Jeremy] Thanks.

44
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,285
- I mean, all your, all of your brothers,

45
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,118
"I wonder if we could do that?"

46
00:01:28,118 --> 00:01:30,101
- [Kendra] I know.

47
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:31,561
- It's gonna be the trend now.

48
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,811
- Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.

49
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:34,365
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.

50
00:01:34,365 --> 00:01:36,735
You pat it, roll it, mark it with a "L".

51
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:39,169
And throw it in the oven
for Laura and Belle.

52
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:40,909
Whoever that is.

53
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:44,100
- And we're playing a bunch
of different games here.

54
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,517
(rock music)

55
00:01:52,907 --> 00:01:54,856
We're gonna get Brent this time.

56
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:55,689
Go!

57
00:01:58,542 --> 00:02:01,959
(screaming and laughing)

58
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:10,154
(sped up high squeaky voices)

59
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:20,881
(slowed down low tone)

60
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,298
(rock music)

61
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,877
- That was close.

62
00:02:27,417 --> 00:02:28,913
- [Jeremy] You're on it, you're doin' it!

63
00:02:28,913 --> 00:02:30,080
You're flying!

64
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:33,189
Kay, I wanna try it, here.

65
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:35,606
(rock music)

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,353
- [Jeremy] You're gettin' a drink?

67
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:48,946
- [Little Boy] My turn.

68
00:02:48,946 --> 00:02:49,779
- Not yet.

69
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,081
- [Jeremy] When you
get some good exercise,

70
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:55,349
you gotta get a good drink huh?

71
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,868
So, Granny Jo was the one
who sent us this fun toy

72
00:02:57,868 --> 00:02:59,656
that the kids are playing with again.

73
00:02:59,656 --> 00:03:01,490
- [Kendra] Whatcha eatin'?

74
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,794
- [Little Boy] Lucky charms.

75
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:04,013
- Lucky charms.

76
00:03:04,013 --> 00:03:06,865
- [Kendra] Mmmm, what
do you like about it?

77
00:03:06,865 --> 00:03:09,220
- [Little Girl] They
have yummy marshmallows.

78
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,689
- [Little Boy] They have these, see?

79
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,576
- [Kendra] I see them.

80
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:14,841
- Look, a rainbow!

81
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:15,901
- [Kendra] A rainbow?

82
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:17,618
- These are marshmallows.

83
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:18,946
- [Kendra] Whoa.

84
00:03:18,946 --> 00:03:20,197
- Oh, now I find it.

85
00:03:20,197 --> 00:03:21,735
This is the present.

86
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,106
- [Kendra] I can see how
it looks like a present.

87
00:03:23,106 --> 00:03:24,984
It also, I think it
might be a shooting star.

88
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,585
What about you dude?

89
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:28,223
- I like this one.

90
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:29,056
- [Kendra] What is it?

91
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:29,889
- A moon.

92
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,187
- My mom never bought
sugary cereal growing up,

93
00:03:32,187 --> 00:03:33,336
which is great.

94
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,568
I think that's awesome.

95
00:03:34,568 --> 00:03:36,980
But um, I loved Lucky Charms.

96
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,015
It was like a highly coveted treat so,

97
00:03:40,015 --> 00:03:44,182
these are some pretty lucky
kids havin' this snack.

98
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:49,684
- Must not have been that good of a book.

99
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:51,143
Keith has the ability to fall asleep

100
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:53,589
in the most interesting positions right?

101
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:55,022
Okay, Isaac is the judge.

102
00:03:55,022 --> 00:03:56,177
What's the word?

103
00:03:56,177 --> 00:03:57,142
- Cozy.

104
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:00,478
- [Jeremy] Cozy. We gotta look for cozy.

105
00:04:00,478 --> 00:04:03,386
- Okay, I think the most coziest

106
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:06,413
would probably be Panda Bear.

107
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,280
(yelling and screaming)

108
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,387
- [Jeremy] You got it, you got it!

109
00:04:10,387 --> 00:04:12,227
She wants to play.

110
00:04:12,227 --> 00:04:13,797
She just wants to play.

111
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,694
- [Papa Keith] Pick another red one Luke.

112
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:16,933
- [Jeremy] Just let me play.

113
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:17,899
(baby crying)

114
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,316
Just let me play.

115
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,126
Here she comes!

116
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:24,794
- [Little Boy] What in the heck?

117
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,992
- [Kendra] Stand up tall, Cubby.

118
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:28,409
Balance, balance.

119
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,560
Whooo!

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,569
So Caleb was just begging for a pet.

121
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:34,231
Guess what pet he's begging for?

122
00:04:34,231 --> 00:04:36,082
He wants a pet Alligator.

123
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:37,290
Is that what you want?

124
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,701
- Did you know it's name it had to be?

125
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:43,868
- [Kendra] Oh what would
you name your pet Alligator?

126
00:04:46,028 --> 00:04:47,458
- Carson.

127
00:04:47,458 --> 00:04:49,939
- [Kendra] Carson, good one.

128
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,355
Carson, the pet Alligator.

129
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:54,596
So, we're playing a crazy
game where you're trying

130
00:04:54,596 --> 00:04:57,853
to not let the ping pong
ball get blown off the table.

131
00:04:57,853 --> 00:04:59,686
- It's all about form.

132
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,707
(blowing)

133
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,235
(laughing)

134
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:07,402
(blowing)

135
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:11,881
(laughing)

136
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,404
- [ Jeremy] Did you hit the
camera, it was right on.

137
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,826
- [Granny Jo] You're gonna start gloatin'.

138
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:24,993
(blowing)

139
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,059
(laughing)

140
00:05:34,114 --> 00:05:35,357
- [Guest Woman] It's all about placement,

141
00:05:35,357 --> 00:05:36,751
you gotta go bottom of the ball.

142
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:39,084
- [Granny Jo] Bottom. Yeah.

143
00:05:41,356 --> 00:05:45,189
(sped up high squeaky voices)

144
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:49,129
- I think I'm gonna pass out.

145
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,737
(blowing)

146
00:05:55,395 --> 00:05:57,478
It can enhance the game.

147
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,502
(laughing)

148
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:04,908
Kay, so this one time, Jeremy
and I were playing Clue

149
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:05,958
with a bunch of friends.

150
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:08,762
On the first round, he guessed
everything and it was right.

151
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:10,262
It was the boringest game ever.

152
00:06:10,262 --> 00:06:11,095
- [Granny Jo] Really?

153
00:06:11,095 --> 00:06:14,447
- They didn't invite us over again.

154
00:06:14,447 --> 00:06:16,412
I missed the vital rule.

155
00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:19,015
Which means that I'm likely going to be...

156
00:06:19,015 --> 00:06:19,881
- [Kendra] Pooh head.

157
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,213
- Pooh head.

158
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,555
- Hopefully, I got really bad luck,

159
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:25,000
and had to pick up the whole deck,

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,982
and so now, it's lookin'
not so great for me either.

161
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:31,364
- [Guest Man] Oh, oh, oh,
yeah this means Im gonna get..

162
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:32,849
- [Kendra] Ooh Jeremy, do you
get to play your first one?

163
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,497
- [Guest Man] I'm gonna get a free play.

164
00:06:34,497 --> 00:06:36,393
- [Guest Woman] A two, a ten, or an ace.

165
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:38,226
This was me last time.

166
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,190
Maverick.

167
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:43,992
(laughing)

168
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,065
- Not quite what I was hoping for.

169
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:48,184
- [Kendra] Bummer.

170
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,536
(laughing)

171
00:06:49,536 --> 00:06:50,929
- [Jeremy] Wait, so
there's nothing out there.

172
00:06:50,929 --> 00:06:52,648
So no matter what you do...

173
00:06:52,648 --> 00:06:56,666
- I don't know which
one has the right aura.

174
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,712
- [Jeremy] Kendra gets a
little freaky with cards.

175
00:06:58,712 --> 00:06:59,545
- [ Kendra] Two!

176
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:01,552
- [Granny Jo] Two, yeah!

177
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:03,074
- [Jeremy] That was a bad
one. That was the worst.

178
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,766
- I know, dang it. But it fake-ied me,

179
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,255
'cause it's a little card. Leave me alone.

180
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,505
(laughing)

181
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:12,608
- This is awesome.

182
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,258
- [Jeremy] Backfire.

183
00:07:16,258 --> 00:07:18,508
(laughing)

184
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:24,026
- It kills me to not
know what's under them.

185
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,314
- [Granny Jo] I know.

186
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:26,609
- [Kendra] Yes!

187
00:07:26,609 --> 00:07:28,240
(cheering)

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,163
- [Jeremy] Wow, she got
the three last time.

189
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:36,051
I almost won the game, but then I lost.

190
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,461
- Second to last!

191
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:39,427
(laughing)

192
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:41,460
Two games in a row.

193
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,627
- [Kendra] But babe, you got
Pooed two games in a row.

194
00:07:47,563 --> 00:00:00,000
