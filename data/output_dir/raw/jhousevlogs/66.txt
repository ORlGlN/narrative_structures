1
00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:02,755
- Some of our pipes are frozen.

2
00:00:02,755 --> 00:00:05,760
- [Jeremy] Get him! (laughs)

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,596
- [Kendra] Laura's
getting ready for the day.

4
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:10,179
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:20,783
- I'm making muffins.

6
00:00:20,783 --> 00:00:21,961
- [Kendra] What kinda muffins?

7
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:23,488
- Cinnamon.

8
00:00:23,488 --> 00:00:25,712
- [Kendra] That's a great
way to start a new year, huh?

9
00:00:25,712 --> 00:00:27,687
What month is it today?

10
00:00:27,687 --> 00:00:29,012
- January.

11
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:31,657
- [Kendra] January,
what happens in January.

12
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:32,762
- I'm four.

13
00:00:32,762 --> 00:00:34,186
- [Kendra] (gasps) Not yet
though, you have to wait

14
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:35,117
until your birthday.

15
00:00:35,117 --> 00:00:35,950
- Yeah.

16
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,783
- Good morning.

17
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:40,621
It is officially 2018 and
we are starting the day off

18
00:00:40,621 --> 00:00:43,700
in a very, very cold Kansas City.

19
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,948
It is negative nine degrees out right now.

20
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:46,787
That's not even wind chill.

21
00:00:46,787 --> 00:00:48,333
That's just the actual temperature.

22
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:49,669
So we were hoping to go out

23
00:00:49,669 --> 00:00:50,934
and have a fun breakfast out.

24
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:52,313
But honestly we don't
wanna leave our house.

25
00:00:52,313 --> 00:00:55,358
So, we are making cinnamon muffins.

26
00:00:55,358 --> 00:00:57,543
Caleb is making cinnamon muffins.

27
00:00:57,543 --> 00:00:58,376
Here they are.

28
00:00:58,376 --> 00:01:01,036
(upbeat music)

29
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:01,869
Nice.

30
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,937
Bless you Miss Nae Nae.

31
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:04,770
Bless you.

32
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:13,071
(Jeremy taps rhythmically)

33
00:01:20,238 --> 00:01:22,374
- [Jeremy] Kendra's making a smoothie.

34
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,894
- So we're having cinnamon muffins,

35
00:01:23,894 --> 00:01:25,530
a smoothie and eggs.

36
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,088
- [Laura] I'm helping with the yogurt.

37
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,421
- [Kendra] Sure.

38
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,740
There it is.

39
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:43,265
Yum.

40
00:01:43,265 --> 00:01:46,128
- So Travis and Ashley brought
this game over, Pentago.

41
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:48,490
And we are loving it.

42
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,362
- No, it is not sponsored,
but it should be.

43
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,352
(laughing)

44
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:54,852
(happy music)

45
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,318
No Dad, I got five in a row.

46
00:01:59,318 --> 00:02:00,655
- What?

47
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:01,731
He did it!

48
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:03,104
Five in a row.

49
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,888
Isaac wins it.

50
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:06,055
Five in a row.

51
00:02:07,035 --> 00:02:09,398
This is like an epic tic tac toe game.

52
00:02:09,398 --> 00:02:10,808
Isaac hasn't lost yet.

53
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:13,077
- [Kendra] This game
messes with your mind.

54
00:02:13,077 --> 00:02:14,827
Like it's just crazy.

55
00:02:16,432 --> 00:02:17,661
- [Isaac] Five in a row.

56
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:18,494
- Dang it.

57
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,077
- [Kendra] Yay, he beat you.

58
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:23,776
- That's twice that he's
beat me with a diagonal.

59
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,162
- I know, but it's hard because he puts it

60
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,374
on three different squares.

61
00:02:27,374 --> 00:02:28,207
I'm trying to make chores

62
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:29,710
a little bit more exciting this morning,

63
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,192
so I have papers with
chores written on them.

64
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,117
And the kids get to choose them.

65
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:34,120
Maybe that'll be more fun
than having them assigned,

66
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,953
I don't know.

67
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:36,946
But the chores have to get
done, so we're doing 'em.

68
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:38,978
Dun dun dun, dun dun dun, dun!

69
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:39,870
What'd you get?

70
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,114
- Bathroom!

71
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:42,416
- Whoo!

72
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:43,847
She gets to clean the bathroom.

73
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:44,680
- Yay!

74
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:47,668
- I want this one.

75
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,501
(laughs)

76
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,334
- What'd you get?

77
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:50,167
Laundry!

78
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:53,543
Thank you.

79
00:02:53,543 --> 00:02:55,047
- You're welcome.

80
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,348
I got like the hardest chore.

81
00:02:57,348 --> 00:02:58,181
- [Kendra] You can do it.

82
00:02:58,181 --> 00:02:59,527
Hey, let's go do the laundry.

83
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:00,777
Ready, set, go!

84
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:04,389
I'm gonna race you to the washing machine.

85
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:05,623
On your mark.

86
00:03:05,623 --> 00:03:06,456
Yes!

87
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:11,210
- Mine?
- Yeah.

88
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,081
- Just mine?

89
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,311
- [Kendra] Yeah, your laundry hamper.

90
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:15,430
- Can we just do something?

91
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:17,740
- [Kendra] Laura's
getting ready for the day.

92
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,091
- Perfect.

93
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:21,166
This is what I call perfect.

94
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,833
(playful music)

95
00:03:25,851 --> 00:03:28,128
- Somebody's not feeling the new year.

96
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,461
We've got a fussy Gus today.

97
00:03:32,887 --> 00:03:35,470
(upbeat music)

98
00:03:36,838 --> 00:03:37,898
So we're starting off the new year

99
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,180
with some serious fun today.

100
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,441
There's a new trampoline park in the area

101
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,700
and so we're trying it out.

102
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,952
The kids are excited because
they get to jump on trampolines

103
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,622
and I'm excited because it's warm in here

104
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:49,789
and they can be active and having fun.

105
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,438
We're here with friends,
which makes everything better.

106
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,720
And seriously, how did
people live in cold climates

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,254
like 200 years ago?

108
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:07,860
I do not think I would survive.

109
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,938
I would be whining a lot.

110
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:13,105
(thumping rock music)

111
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:26,653
(Jeremy laughs)

112
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,357
- [Jeremy] Oh!

113
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,821
- [Kendra] Jeremy's up on the jousting.

114
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,315
He's gonna go against, Caleb.

115
00:04:43,315 --> 00:04:45,732
- [Announcer] Ready, set, go!

116
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,157
(Kendra laughs)

117
00:04:56,157 --> 00:04:58,657
(tense music)

118
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:00,765
- [Kendra] Good job Lise!

119
00:05:00,765 --> 00:05:02,246
Oh!

120
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:04,496
- [Jeremy] Oh, oh, get him.

121
00:05:06,799 --> 00:05:09,094
(laughs)

122
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:10,427
Go for his legs.

123
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:13,448
Oh!

124
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:15,546
Good job.

125
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:17,417
(imitates tense music)

126
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:18,395
She's getting me.

127
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,316
No!

128
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:20,301
No!

129
00:05:20,301 --> 00:05:22,513
Caleb with the helmet on.

130
00:05:22,513 --> 00:05:24,071
Nice!

131
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,654
(upbeat music)

132
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,746
- [Kendra] Jeremy and Elise
are racing some sort of race.

133
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:34,913
They're going.

134
00:05:39,696 --> 00:05:40,863
- Oh, you won!

135
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:49,137
- [Kendra] Uh oh.

136
00:05:49,137 --> 00:05:49,970
Oh no!

137
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:53,762
- [Isaac] Yeah!

138
00:05:54,893 --> 00:05:58,272
- [Kendra] Isaac is
getting Jeremy so good!

139
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,105
These two are so cute.

140
00:06:04,661 --> 00:06:05,972
(Jeremy babbles)

141
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,055
She likes it.

142
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,638
She likes the trampoline.

143
00:06:12,203 --> 00:06:13,286
- Whoo!

144
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:15,622
- [Kendra] There's too many
kids here to put her down.

145
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:16,716
But she loves it.

146
00:06:16,716 --> 00:06:17,549
- Yeah!

147
00:06:18,972 --> 00:06:19,805
One, one.

148
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:23,706
- [Kendra] Hey you.

149
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:24,539
- So we're gonna go.

150
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,262
We're heading to a movie
with all of our cousins.

151
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,503
- [Kendra] And Granny Jo.

152
00:06:28,503 --> 00:06:29,900
- And Granny Jo, my mom's in town.

153
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,733
- So this is a big deal

154
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:33,153
because our kids have actually
not gone to a movie theater.

155
00:06:33,153 --> 00:06:34,387
Except for Isaac.
- Like Isaac's first one

156
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:35,445
was Wonder.

157
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,099
- Yeah, and our other
kids have never gone.

158
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:38,001
So this is a big deal.

159
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,086
I'm gonna stay home with her though,

160
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:41,003
she's not ready for it.

161
00:06:42,418 --> 00:06:44,874
- [Jeremy] So how do you guys
feel about going to a movie?

162
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:45,707
- [Isaac] Excited.

163
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:46,540
- [Caleb] Excited.

164
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,743
- Hopefully we get the middle, middle.

165
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:50,576
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

166
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,349
Find theater 10 you guys.

167
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:53,266
Theater 10.

168
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,695
(bright music)

169
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,723
Alright, what'd you guys
think about the movie?

170
00:07:06,723 --> 00:07:08,385
- I really liked it.
- It was good.

171
00:07:08,385 --> 00:07:09,818
- It kind of made me cry.

172
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:10,813
- [Jeremy] Did you cry?

173
00:07:10,813 --> 00:07:12,757
No spoiler alerts.

174
00:07:12,757 --> 00:07:14,542
We won't say why.

175
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:15,809
- I didn't cry.

176
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:16,715
- [Jeremy] You didn't cry?

177
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:17,828
What'd you think about it?

178
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,945
- I didn't cry at all.

179
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,041
- [Jeremy] Did you like the movie?

180
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,002
- Yeah, I liked the movie.

181
00:07:22,002 --> 00:07:23,436
- I loved the movie.

182
00:07:23,436 --> 00:07:24,509
It was really good.

183
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,914
I think Wonder's a little bit better, but,

184
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:28,957
it's really good.

185
00:07:28,957 --> 00:07:31,895
- What I loved about Coco was that idea

186
00:07:31,895 --> 00:07:34,618
of chasing your dream and
the importance of family.

187
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:38,255
And the way that they put
those together in a unique way.

188
00:07:38,255 --> 00:07:40,597
And so it was really good,
it was touching, good show.

- [Kendra] Wow, what song is this?

198
00:08:01,486 --> 00:08:02,596
- It's Demons.

199
00:08:02,596 --> 00:08:03,587
- [Kendra] By who?

200
00:08:03,587 --> 00:08:05,065
- Imagine Dragons.

201
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,465
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae found Ivy.

202
00:08:06,465 --> 00:08:07,715
She's so happy.

203
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:11,596
- [Kendra] Oh be soft.

204
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:14,107
Oh be so soft to Ivy.

205
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:15,274
She loves her.

206
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:18,950
Well, time to go.

207
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:20,887
- Go get her.

208
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:23,843
So my mom came out to visit from Arizona.

209
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:24,676
- Yay.

210
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:27,407
Hi Janae.

211
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:32,546
- Well unfortunately it is cold enough

212
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,221
that when we came home this evening,

213
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:37,005
some of our pipes are frozen.

214
00:08:37,005 --> 00:08:39,186
At least this bathtub is.

215
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,269
The water will not drain.

216
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:45,410
So we poured a whole
buncha salt down there.

217
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,217
And we're hoping it will thaw out.

218
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:49,797
- Why is it not coming out?

219
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:53,568
- It's because the water
in that pipe right there,

220
00:08:53,568 --> 00:08:54,401
is frozen.

221
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,688
So it's like a big ice cube so
the water can't get past it.

222
00:08:58,688 --> 00:08:59,916
And if it does that too much,

223
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,692
then sometimes the pipes break.

224
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,763
- Ooo.

225
00:09:03,763 --> 00:09:06,544
- Luckily our showers and
all of our other sinks

226
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:07,572
are all functioning.

227
00:09:07,572 --> 00:09:09,017
It's just this one bathtub.

228
00:09:09,017 --> 00:09:10,524
And this has happened
before a few years ago.

229
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:13,952
But last time, I sprinkled a
little bit of salt and wallah,

230
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:17,040
so this one's making me a
little bit more nervous.

231
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,195
Can you feel it?

232
00:09:18,195 --> 00:09:20,703
(playfully pensive music)

233
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:22,002
What do you feel?

234
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:23,746
- I feel ice.

235
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:25,475
It can go all the way down there

236
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:28,719
and then everywhere else is ice.

237
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:30,912
- I know, it's solid ice down there.

238
00:09:30,912 --> 00:09:34,957
I know some friends that
today are without water, so.

239
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,204
Poor Janae keeps crawling up
to the side of the bathtub

240
00:09:37,204 --> 00:09:39,695
and crying and whining,
'cause she loves baths

241
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:41,031
and she wants to take a bath right now.

242
00:09:41,031 --> 00:09:43,872
But I can't give her a bath right now.

243
00:09:43,872 --> 00:09:44,992
Say good night.

244
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:47,232
Goodnight, J House out.

245
00:09:47,232 --> 00:09:50,329
- [Jeremy] You might win the whole league.

246
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,793
- It's is cold princess?

247
00:09:51,793 --> 00:09:54,275
Like how could we ever use this much salt?

248
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,938
Are you guys excited for our trip?

249
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:57,203
- [Kids] Yeah!

250
00:09:57,203 --> 00:09:58,481
- We're gonna be there for a long time.

251
00:09:58,481 --> 00:09:59,314
(kids yelling)

252
00:09:59,314 --> 00:10:01,701
- [Jeremy] Happy New Year!

253
00:10:01,701 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
