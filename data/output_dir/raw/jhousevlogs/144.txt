1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,003
- You're going to Hogwarts!

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:02,920
Gryffindor.

3
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,056
(sewing machine whirring)

4
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:06,471
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

5
00:00:06,471 --> 00:00:08,372
- [Kendra] Hi.

6
00:00:08,372 --> 00:00:10,271
- This is so weird.

7
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,421
- I didn't make it to Hogwarts.

8
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:12,254
- [Kendra] You didn't make it?

9
00:00:12,254 --> 00:00:13,235
- Yeah.

10
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:15,173
(adventurous music)

11
00:00:15,173 --> 00:00:17,831
- So little Miss Janae is
definitely getting sick.

12
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,464
She's all boogery and snotty,

13
00:00:20,464 --> 00:00:22,972
and she's having a hard time.

14
00:00:22,972 --> 00:00:24,876
Anyway, she's had a little
bit of a rough night

15
00:00:24,876 --> 00:00:26,629
and a little bit of a rough morning,

16
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:28,717
so hopefully she'll take some good naps.

17
00:00:28,717 --> 00:00:30,028
Hi.

18
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,164
Can you say hi?

19
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,497
There's a smile.

20
00:00:34,172 --> 00:00:35,932
I got something new that I'm excited

21
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,868
and a little bit nervous
to try with the kids today.

22
00:00:37,868 --> 00:00:40,035
So this is what I got.

23
00:00:40,035 --> 00:00:41,348
Laura, what is it?

24
00:00:41,348 --> 00:00:43,188
- It's a sewing machine.

25
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:44,759
- Have you used a sewing machine before?

26
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:45,592
- No.

27
00:00:45,592 --> 00:00:47,107
Maybe you can help me.

28
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:48,579
- [Kendra] Yeah, maybe
we can do it together.

29
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:49,508
- Can I try it out?

30
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:51,296
- [Kendra] Maybe, let's open it up.

31
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:52,236
Good job team.

32
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,771
- Avocados.

33
00:00:53,771 --> 00:00:55,104
Avocado avocado.

34
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:58,841
Tomato tomato tomato.

35
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:01,133
- I've said it before,
and I'll say it again,

36
00:01:01,133 --> 00:01:03,746
it is so nice having kids
that are big enough to help.

37
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:05,259
Ready set go.

38
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:07,170
(sewing machine whirring)

39
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,249
Did you guys see?

40
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:09,551
It's taking the thread from here

41
00:01:09,551 --> 00:01:11,029
and putting it over here.

42
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,075
- Dude.

43
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:14,371
- [Kendra] So we're supposed to clip this

44
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,648
and then rewind this until it's full.

45
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:20,016
(melodious music)

46
00:01:20,016 --> 00:01:20,849
(sewing machine whirring)

47
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,016
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

48
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:24,773
- Well the first thing Isaac learned

49
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:26,264
when he learned the violin

50
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:28,136
is all the parts of the violin.

51
00:01:28,136 --> 00:01:29,938
So that's the same thing
we're gonna do with this.

52
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:32,345
This is the upper thread guide.

53
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:33,936
See how the thread is going through there?

54
00:01:33,936 --> 00:01:35,537
I brought it down here

55
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,599
and then up through here

56
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,046
and then back down here.

57
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:39,518
It's called the presser foot.

58
00:01:39,518 --> 00:01:42,253
Do you guys see this
white lever right here?

59
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,141
This is the presser foot lifter.

60
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,516
Watch it lift.
- A long name.

61
00:01:45,516 --> 00:01:46,772
- Well I forgot the camera.

62
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:49,069
I'm at Janae's well child check

63
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:49,977
and I don't know why I always forget

64
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,226
the camera when I come to these things,

65
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:52,693
so I'm videoing on my phone real quick.

66
00:01:52,693 --> 00:01:53,696
Hey you.

67
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:54,687
(atmospheric music)

68
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:58,590
So Janae, it looks like she
weighs almost 16 pounds.

69
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,195
Well she had to get her
shots which was so sad.

70
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:03,139
But you did great, didn't ya.

71
00:02:03,139 --> 00:02:04,462
(coughing)

72
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:05,558
Yep.

73
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:06,614
Should we go home now?

74
00:02:06,614 --> 00:02:08,805
(coughing)

75
00:02:08,805 --> 00:02:09,638
Oh.

76
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:13,863
(cough)

77
00:02:13,863 --> 00:02:16,196
Are you fake coughing at me?

78
00:02:20,247 --> 00:02:21,599
(cooing)

79
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,682
Hi, hi Janae.

80
00:02:24,702 --> 00:02:26,263
So the doctor's office is really close

81
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:27,930
to the fabric store.

82
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,655
I don't even like to sew

83
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:33,230
and I think I could be a fabric hoarder.

84
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,996
This is beautiful.

85
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:37,356
I just love it, it's
so bright and colorful.

86
00:02:37,356 --> 00:02:38,746
I love this fabric right here.

87
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:41,259
It's a flannel and it's so soft.

88
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,384
I think that would make
a great gender neutral

89
00:02:43,384 --> 00:02:44,580
little baby blanket.

90
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,580
(upbeat jazz music)

91
00:02:49,734 --> 00:02:52,104
So Caleb had a little bit
of a rough afternoon today.

92
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:54,982
His finger got jammed
pretty good in the door.

93
00:02:54,982 --> 00:02:56,129
And it swelled up right away.

94
00:02:56,129 --> 00:02:57,708
I was really nervous there for minute,

95
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,773
that it was broken.

96
00:02:58,773 --> 00:02:59,636
But he can move it.

97
00:02:59,636 --> 00:03:02,069
We iced it and some of the
swelling has gone down.

98
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:03,290
He's been telling me that he's nervous

99
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,023
about eating and writing.

100
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:07,808
Since we're busting out
the sewing machine today,

101
00:03:07,808 --> 00:03:09,348
we're doing a little unit on quilts.

102
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,573
I got some fun quilt book read alouds.

103
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,635
I'm letting the kids look
through quilt patterns

104
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:16,078
and choose some of the
ones that they most like.

105
00:03:16,078 --> 00:03:16,911
Not 'cause we're gonna make them,

106
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:20,995
but just to open their eyes
to what a quilt can be.

107
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:21,828
Hi.

108
00:03:23,443 --> 00:03:26,467
Did you find some toys down here?

109
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,555
That's quite the maneuver there.

110
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,963
Are you just gonna stand up?

111
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:30,315
Jeremy's working hard today.

112
00:03:30,315 --> 00:03:31,376
When he's working hard,

113
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,418
he's often is in his sweats.

114
00:03:33,418 --> 00:03:34,593
- Stays in his pajamas.

115
00:03:34,593 --> 00:03:35,634
- [Kendra] Yeah (laughs).

116
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:38,538
She loves the play food stuff.

117
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:39,371
- Uh-oh,

118
00:03:41,835 --> 00:03:42,668
Oh.

119
00:03:45,323 --> 00:03:46,906
She is so precious.

120
00:03:48,723 --> 00:03:51,257
And makes me so happy.

121
00:03:51,257 --> 00:03:53,449
(bright music)

122
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:56,018
- [Kendra] So I want
everyone to try three designs

123
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,518
before you glue it down, okay?

124
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:13,826
Mama read us Papa's letters from places

125
00:04:13,826 --> 00:04:16,723
like Antietam Creek and Gettysburg.

126
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,806
At last the war was over.

127
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,442
- Hello.

128
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,275
- How are you doing?

129
00:04:24,275 --> 00:04:27,110
- We have a special movie
that we saw just came in

130
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,871
that we're gonna watch
tonight with out kids.

131
00:04:29,871 --> 00:04:30,704
- Cool.

132
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:34,335
- [Laura] Dad, tell them
that it's Harry Potter.

133
00:04:34,335 --> 00:04:35,404
- Should I tell her?

134
00:04:35,404 --> 00:04:36,237
Okay.

135
00:04:36,237 --> 00:04:37,317
- [Laura] That it's Harry Potter.

136
00:04:37,317 --> 00:04:38,566
- Harry Potter.

137
00:04:38,566 --> 00:04:39,399
- Harry Potter?

138
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,665
- We just finished reading the first book

139
00:04:40,665 --> 00:04:42,056
with our kids.

140
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:43,247
Are you guys excited to watch it tonight?

141
00:04:43,247 --> 00:04:44,080
- Yeah.
- Yep.

142
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,044
- [Kendra] So this is
an Origami sorting hat

143
00:04:47,044 --> 00:04:49,514
printable that I found
from Harry Potter online.

144
00:04:49,514 --> 00:04:51,481
What do you think you will be?

145
00:04:51,481 --> 00:04:53,398
- Hopefully Gryffindor.

146
00:04:54,322 --> 00:04:55,155
- [Kendra] Yeah, how about you Lise,

147
00:04:55,155 --> 00:04:56,348
what do you think you'll be?

148
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:57,865
- Gryffindor.

149
00:04:57,865 --> 00:04:59,732
- [Kendra] How about you Laura?

150
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:00,685
- Moana.

151
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:02,296
- [Kendra] You think
you're gonna be Moana?

152
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:05,266
- I'm old enough that now I don't have

153
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,955
to be buckled in one of these.

154
00:05:07,955 --> 00:05:10,152
- [Jeremy] I don't know, you
better buckle to be safe.

155
00:05:10,152 --> 00:05:11,357
- That's true.

156
00:05:11,357 --> 00:05:14,357
(lively rock music)

157
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,884
- Well I think Jeremy got enough fries.

158
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:28,972
- [Jeremy] It's the family one.

159
00:05:28,972 --> 00:05:31,352
There's nothing worse than
not having enough fries.

160
00:05:31,352 --> 00:05:32,185
- That's true.

161
00:05:32,185 --> 00:05:34,726
Okay fish sandwich, you right?

162
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,302
I got a cheeseburger here.

163
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:38,398
Chicken.

164
00:05:38,398 --> 00:05:39,389
(yells)

165
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:40,730
- Okay so poll question,

166
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,506
what would you choose if you had

167
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:43,930
to eat our dinner.

168
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,425
Would you get a cheeseburger,

169
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:51,207
a fish sandwich, chicken or
the mushroom Swiss burger.

170
00:05:51,207 --> 00:05:52,183
Let us know in the poll.

171
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,503
That's one of the best.

172
00:05:54,503 --> 00:05:56,902
♫ Oh the Lord's been good to me

173
00:05:56,902 --> 00:05:59,462
♫ And so I thank the Lord

174
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:02,294
♫ For giving me the things I need

175
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,790
♫ The sun and the rain and the appleseed

176
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,454
♫ The Lord's been good to me

177
00:06:08,454 --> 00:06:10,638
♫ Do do do do do

178
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:12,005
That's such a good song.

179
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:13,924
- [Kendra] Okay Laura,
show us how you like it.

180
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,708
- I like it like this.

181
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,708
Dum dum dum.

182
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,936
- You are a dipping master.

183
00:06:21,936 --> 00:06:23,768
So I love reading family read a loud books

184
00:06:23,768 --> 00:06:24,824
that also have a movie,

185
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,235
because it makes for a perfect celebration

186
00:06:26,235 --> 00:06:27,547
at the end of reading the book together.

187
00:06:27,547 --> 00:06:29,212
And we've really enjoyed
reading Harry Potter

188
00:06:29,212 --> 00:06:31,952
and I wanted to pull off a
super awesome celebration today,

189
00:06:31,952 --> 00:06:33,248
but it's just not happening.

190
00:06:33,248 --> 00:06:34,834
But we're still gonna have a lot of fun.

191
00:06:34,834 --> 00:06:37,191
So just this morning an owl came

192
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:38,851
and left a note on our front door.

193
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:40,479
And it said that you guys are
supposed to get your stuff

194
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,144
and go to platform nine
and three-quarters.

195
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:44,646
You're going to Hogwarts!

196
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:45,707
Go.

197
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:49,115
(enchanting music)

198
00:06:49,115 --> 00:06:51,365
(laughing)

199
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:02,645
- I didn't make it to Hogwarts.

200
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:03,478
- [Kendra] You didn't make it?

201
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:04,362
- Yeah.

202
00:07:04,362 --> 00:07:06,378
(enchanting music)

203
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:08,513
- He's waiting for the cat.

204
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,096
The cat is someone.

205
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,026
- [Jeremy] What are you guys eating?

206
00:07:14,026 --> 00:07:15,786
- Every flavor of beans.

207
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:16,789
- [Jeremy] Yummy.

208
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,415
Hopefully you don't get a booger one.

209
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:20,390
- Are you ready to be sorted?

210
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,736
Alright, first you have to choose

211
00:07:21,736 --> 00:07:23,569
one of these pictures.

212
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,247
The potion?

213
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,815
One two three.

214
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,239
Now choose one of these words,

215
00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,406
Seeker broom hat or lumos.

216
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:36,321
- Broom.

217
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,502
- Broom.

218
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:39,835
B-R-O-O-M.

219
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,402
Choose one more.

220
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:46,162
Lumos.

221
00:07:48,086 --> 00:07:49,003
Gryffindor!

222
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:51,437
Brave at heart.

223
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,585
- [Jeremy] Congratulations.

224
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:55,512
- Alright, you may go
to the Gryffindor table.

225
00:07:55,512 --> 00:07:57,034
Oh thank you.

226
00:07:57,034 --> 00:07:58,284
Pick a picture.

227
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,251
- This one.

228
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:01,183
- The snitch.

229
00:08:01,183 --> 00:08:03,904
One two three four five.

230
00:08:03,904 --> 00:08:06,241
Alright, are you ready?

231
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,479
Hufflepuff!

232
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,543
Patient and true.

233
00:08:09,543 --> 00:08:11,890
- I was wanting to be in Gryffindor.

234
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,323
- You'll be an amazing Hufflepuff
though, patient and true.

235
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:16,156
That one.

236
00:08:16,156 --> 00:08:17,888
One two three four.

237
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:20,180
You want this one?

238
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,763
Ah you're a muggle.

239
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,371
- Muggle!

240
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,461
- That means you can be Moana.

241
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,294
- Azkaban.

242
00:08:27,294 --> 00:08:31,461
- Alright, seven, one two
three four five six seven.

243
00:08:32,765 --> 00:08:33,804
- Padfoot.

244
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,488
- Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

245
00:08:36,488 --> 00:08:37,572
Gryffindor,

246
00:08:37,572 --> 00:08:38,918
- Yeah!

247
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,335
- brave at heart!

248
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:42,717
- [Jeremy] Okay back to the movie.

249
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:44,107
- We're gonna make butter bear.

250
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:45,617
It's supposed to be just like the stuff

251
00:08:45,617 --> 00:08:47,384
at Harry Potter world.

252
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:49,573
Alright, these are supposed
to be frozen ice cubes,

253
00:08:49,573 --> 00:08:50,841
but we didn't have enough time for them

254
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,186
to all the way freeze.

255
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:53,486
- [Jeremy] They're slushee ice cubes.

256
00:08:53,486 --> 00:08:55,175
- They're slushee ice cubes.

257
00:08:55,175 --> 00:08:57,571
Alright, so now we need
two cups of ice cream.

258
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,539
- [Caleb] That's so much ice cream.

259
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,373
- [Jeremy] So that's slushee
cream soda on the bottom.

260
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:04,620
Vanilla ice cream.

261
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,325
- Now comes the flavoring.

262
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,486
- It seems like caramel.

263
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:08,494
- It is a lot like caramel,

264
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:09,897
it's called butterscotch.

265
00:09:09,897 --> 00:09:11,698
- [Jeremy] And this is
some more cream soda?

266
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:14,690
- This is one more cup of cream soda.

267
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,326
(blender whirring)

268
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:17,909
- That is so weird.

269
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:23,931
(jazzy playful music)

270
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:27,348
(whipped cream spraying)

271
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,993
- Alright.

272
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:43,744
- [Jeremy] Give it a try.

273
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:47,397
- Yuck.

274
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:48,230
(record scratches)

275
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,285
- Whoa.

276
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:50,118
- That's strong.

277
00:09:50,118 --> 00:09:53,195
- It's a very strong flavor.

278
00:09:53,195 --> 00:09:55,102
- [Laura] That is strong.

279
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:55,935
- [Jeremy] No one likes it.

280
00:09:55,935 --> 00:09:58,081
- That is very strong.

281
00:09:58,081 --> 00:10:00,942
- So it reminds me of eggnog.

282
00:10:00,942 --> 00:10:02,421
Like it's such a distinct flavor

283
00:10:02,421 --> 00:10:04,550
that you'd either like it or you don't.

284
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,626
And if you like butterscotch Jeremy,

285
00:10:05,626 --> 00:10:06,835
I bet you're gonna love this.

286
00:10:06,835 --> 00:10:08,504
- [Jeremy] Yeah, of course.

287
00:10:08,504 --> 00:10:09,624
Hopefully none of you like it,

288
00:10:09,624 --> 00:10:12,915
so that I can drink all of yours.

289
00:10:12,915 --> 00:10:14,308
It does taste like eggnog.

290
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:15,141
- [Kendra] What do you think?

291
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:17,655
- Wizards don't drink eggnog,

292
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:20,238
so this is like eggnog to them.

293
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:23,733
- I don't really like it,

294
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:27,120
but I would rather have
it, than not have it.

295
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,308
(Kendra laughs)

296
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,699
- [Kendra] What do you think buddy?

297
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:31,584
- Tastes kinda weird.

298
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:32,979
I think you might have
put a little bit too much

299
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,646
of the butter stuff.

300
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:37,286
- Well the butter beer turned out

301
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,475
to be not anybody's favorite flavor,

302
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:41,124
I think Jeremy liked it the best,

303
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,077
but it was also super sweet,

304
00:10:43,077 --> 00:10:44,404
so we're not finishing most of it.

305
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:45,436
But it was fun to try.

306
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,045
Even when something isn't our favorite,

307
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:48,125
I love to try new things.

308
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,716
Like it's just cool to experience it

309
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,924
and now we know.

310
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:52,076
Anyway, we're gonna finish up the movie

311
00:10:52,076 --> 00:10:53,444
and go to bed.

312
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,277
Good night.

313
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:55,110
J House out.

314
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,943
Have you been using this,

315
00:10:55,943 --> 00:10:57,731
and he's like yeah, Caleb
and I use it as hair gel.

316
00:10:57,731 --> 00:10:58,564
What?

317
00:10:58,564 --> 00:11:00,767
- [Jeremy] Go go go go go Isaac.

318
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,665
- The parade is almost starting Dad,

319
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:04,544
we've got to go quick.

320
00:11:04,544 --> 00:11:06,520
(laughing)

321
00:11:06,520 --> 00:00:00,000
(lively music)
