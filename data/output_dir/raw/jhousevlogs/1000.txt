1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
(happy music)

2
00:00:06,582 --> 00:00:08,507
- Thanksgiving is my
absolute favorite holiday.

3
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,187
And it was really hard to narrow down

4
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:11,343
my favorite Thanksgiving books.

5
00:00:11,343 --> 00:00:12,901
But I did it, so here they are.

6
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:15,745
My five favorite children's
Thanksgiving books.

7
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:16,862
First up we have

8
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:19,455
"Thank you, Sarah. The Woman
Who Saved Thanksgiving".

9
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,166
And this is the story of Sarah Hale,

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,159
a woman you lived in the 1800s,

11
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,107
and petitioned and campaigned for

12
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:27,030
Thanksgiving to become a national holiday.

13
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,412
- Zachary Taylor, he said no.

14
00:00:29,412 --> 00:00:32,506
And Pierce said no and
then James Buchanan.

15
00:00:32,506 --> 00:00:35,189
But then Lincoln said yes.

16
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,472
- [Mother] What do you
like about this story?

17
00:00:36,472 --> 00:00:39,157
- Her secret weapon, a pen.

18
00:00:39,157 --> 00:00:40,937
- [Mother] Her secret weapon is a pen?

19
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:43,209
I had never heard of
Sarah Hale's story before,

20
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,595
but when I read it in this book

21
00:00:44,595 --> 00:00:48,872
I found it so compelling and
empowering and inspiring.

22
00:00:48,872 --> 00:00:51,284
This woman single-handedly
did amazing things

23
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:52,846
for the women's movement in America

24
00:00:52,846 --> 00:00:54,652
and for Thanksgiving as a holiday.

25
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:55,559
But as soon as I finished it

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,118
I had to find a biography
about her and just read more.

27
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,789
And I may or may not have sat Jeremy down

28
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:02,672
that night, the very first
night I read this book,

29
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:04,031
and read him the picture book.

30
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,358
Next up we have "Thanks for Thanksgiving".

31
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:08,518
This is a simple, short book

32
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:11,008
that just talks about things
that we are thankful for.

33
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:13,357
The illustrations are gorgeous

34
00:01:13,357 --> 00:01:14,750
and for the age of my children

35
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,909
I just always have found
it a little bit magical.

36
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,013
It's definitely up there in my
favorite books for children.

37
00:01:21,013 --> 00:01:23,767
The next up is called
"Balloons over Broadway.

38
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:27,202
The True Story of the
Puppeteer of Macy's Parade".

39
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:28,986
This is the story of Tony Sarg

40
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,268
who is the man who invented
and came up with the idea

41
00:01:32,268 --> 00:01:34,451
of the balloons in the Macy's Day Parade.

42
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:35,582
And I don't know about you guys,

43
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:37,403
but the Macy's Day Parade is definitely

44
00:01:37,403 --> 00:01:39,604
one of my family's
Thanksgiving traditions.

45
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:42,215
And one of my life-long dreams
is to go to that parade.

46
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:44,850
- This is the parade part.

47
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,477
- [Mother] This is the parade part?

48
00:01:46,477 --> 00:01:47,310
- [Boy] Yeah.

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,384
- [Mother] Oh my goodness.

50
00:01:48,384 --> 00:01:50,944
What do you like about it?

51
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,818
- I'll show ya.

52
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:53,933
This part.

53
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:54,766
- [Mother] This part?

54
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,183
What do you like?

55
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,563
- That man.

56
00:02:00,563 --> 00:02:02,761
- So I loved hearing the story

57
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,746
about how that parade came to be

58
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,531
and how the puppets and
the balloons came to be,

59
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,895
and kinda the different problems
that they had with them.

60
00:02:09,895 --> 00:02:13,040
Just a really fun biography.

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,934
Next up are two silly ones

62
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,352
that my kids just laugh and giggle about.

63
00:02:17,352 --> 00:02:20,255
The first one is called
"One is a Feast for Mouse".

64
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:22,167
And it's about this little
mouse that, you know,

65
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:24,673
scurries up on the table
after Thanksgiving dinner

66
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:26,393
and he finds all these little crumbs.

67
00:02:26,393 --> 00:02:28,316
And at first he's content
with one little pea

68
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,945
but then he wants like a little olive,

69
00:02:29,945 --> 00:02:31,027
and a thing of mashed potatoes,

70
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:32,739
and some gravy, and a pumpkin pie.

71
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,255
And it's all a leaning
tower above his head

72
00:02:35,255 --> 00:02:36,753
that comes crashing down

73
00:02:36,753 --> 00:02:39,151
and eventually he runs back into his hole

74
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,531
and barely escapes capture by the cat.

75
00:02:41,531 --> 00:02:43,350
He ends up with just one little pea again.

76
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,749
And he just says, one
is enough for a mouse.

77
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,582
Anyways, so there's like

78
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:48,785
a little subliminal theme there

79
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:51,203
about not trying to be too
greedy and ask for too much.

80
00:02:51,203 --> 00:02:54,341
The next silly Thanksgiving
book that my kids enjoy is

81
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,495
"I Know an Old Woman Who Swallowed a Pie".

82
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,472
She swallowed it whole the entire roll.

83
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:00,264
She swallowed the roll
to go with the cider

84
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,181
that rumbled and mumbled
and grumbled inside her.

85
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,963
She swallowed the cider
that moistened the pie,

86
00:03:03,963 --> 00:03:06,858
the Thanksgiving pie
which was really too dry.

87
00:03:06,858 --> 00:03:08,320
Perhaps she'll die.

88
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,820
- [Woman] Alright, Lis, what
did you like about this book?

89
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,319
- I like it because whenever she comes,

90
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,236
she eats a whole thing.

91
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,929
See?

92
00:03:16,929 --> 00:03:17,762
- [Mother] What happened?

93
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,966
- She swallowed the pan.

94
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,094
- [Mother] She swallowed a whole pan?

95
00:03:21,094 --> 00:03:21,927
- Aha.

96
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,622
- Anyway, it's just a silly book

97
00:03:23,622 --> 00:03:25,783
about all these things
that this woman eats.

98
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:27,946
But you can actually
kind of resonate with it

99
00:03:27,946 --> 00:03:30,871
because on Thanksgiving we eat so much.

100
00:03:30,871 --> 00:03:32,754
Anyway, there are loads of amazing

101
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:33,867
Thanksgiving books out there.

102
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:35,581
But I highly recommend these ones.

103
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,951
They're definitely worth your time.

104
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:39,732
And I hope you guys have
a happy Thanksgiving.

105
00:03:39,732 --> 00:03:40,581
Happy reading.

106
00:03:40,581 --> 00:00:00,000
(happy music)
