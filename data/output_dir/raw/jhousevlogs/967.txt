1
00:00:00,061 --> 00:00:02,978
("Deck The Halls")

2
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:22,515
- So I've never worn lipstick in my life,

3
00:00:22,515 --> 00:00:23,392
like never.

4
00:00:23,392 --> 00:00:24,786
I don't own any lipstick.

5
00:00:24,786 --> 00:00:27,769
And recently, Jeremy very kindly was like,

6
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,362
"So, I wonder what you would
look like with lipstick on."

7
00:00:30,362 --> 00:00:34,249
And I was like, "Hmm, maybe
I should try some lipstick."

8
00:00:34,249 --> 00:00:37,800
So I was at this store, and I
bought two different colors.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,209
This is one of 'em.

10
00:00:39,209 --> 00:00:40,912
I went with like a super cheap brand,

11
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:41,910
'cause I just had no idea

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,802
if I was even gonna like it or not.

13
00:00:43,802 --> 00:00:46,442
This is, what's it called, red carpet.

14
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:48,749
But guys, I feel like a clown.

15
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,001
Like I feel like this looks ridiculous,

16
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,705
and I don't even know if
I'm staying in the lines,

17
00:00:53,705 --> 00:00:56,246
and I have no idea how to get it off,

18
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,508
like I tried it on last night

19
00:00:58,508 --> 00:01:00,399
and I couldn't get it
off for the life of me.

20
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,697
It like smudged all over my face,

21
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:06,859
so I guess I'm asking
for some help, all you

22
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:09,422
fashion conscious ladies out there.

23
00:01:09,422 --> 00:01:12,198
First of all, honestly,
can I pull off this color?

24
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,959
'Cause I feel like I look like a clown,

25
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,268
but maybe that's 'cause
I've never worn it before.

26
00:01:16,268 --> 00:01:18,987
Number two, how do you stay in the lines?

27
00:01:18,987 --> 00:01:21,042
Do I need to be using lip liner?

28
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:24,757
Or is there like a technique I'm missing?

29
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:28,193
(chuckles) And, oh yeah,
the third question is

30
00:01:28,193 --> 00:01:29,135
how do you get it off?

31
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:32,419
Like effectively in the evening or,

32
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:33,252
I don't know.

33
00:01:33,252 --> 00:01:34,234
I know nothing about lipstick,

34
00:01:34,234 --> 00:01:37,538
but anyway, I'm kind of excited to try

35
00:01:37,538 --> 00:01:40,486
even if I do feel like a clown.

36
00:01:40,486 --> 00:01:43,163
Alright, we are headed out
to one of our favorite places

37
00:01:43,163 --> 00:01:47,423
to eat breakfast, lunch, brunch,
as a family this morning.

38
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:49,022
Anyway, we don't take the kids

39
00:01:49,022 --> 00:01:52,238
to sit-down restaurants
very often because honestly

40
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,112
two on four doesn't work very well,

41
00:01:54,112 --> 00:01:55,669
so when Grandma and Papa come into town,

42
00:01:55,669 --> 00:01:57,776
that's a great reason to
take 'em somewhere fun,

43
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:00,456
'cause four on four is
much more easily managed.

44
00:02:00,456 --> 00:02:02,269
- [Papa] She's just happy to be here.

45
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,605
- [Kendra] She is just happy to be here.

46
00:02:04,605 --> 00:02:06,593
- It's a great day

47
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:08,593
for this fun restaurant.

48
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:10,965
- [Grandma] Is it a fun restaurant?

49
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:11,798
- Yeah.

50
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,221
- A super fun restaurant.

51
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:17,123
- This is a farmer's
scramble, so it's eggs,

52
00:02:17,123 --> 00:02:19,914
seasoned potatoes, lots of
veggies, and goat cheese on top,

53
00:02:19,914 --> 00:02:22,411
which I never eat goat
cheese, but in this,

54
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,339
it's amazing.

55
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,716
- [Jeremy] How's your pancake, man?

56
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:25,570
- Good.

57
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,176
- [Jeremy] What flavor did you get again?

58
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:28,409
- Apple cinnamon.

59
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:30,226
- [Jeremy] And what flavor did you get?

60
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:32,066
- Chocolate chip.

61
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,323
- [Jeremy] You guys makin' stuff?

62
00:02:33,323 --> 00:02:34,156
- Uh huh.

63
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:35,235
- [Jeremy] Can I see what you made, Cub?

64
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:37,035
- [Grandma] Show Daddy what you had too.

65
00:02:37,035 --> 00:02:38,512
- [Jeremy] So pretty.

66
00:02:38,512 --> 00:02:39,345
- [Grandma] Yeah.

67
00:02:39,345 --> 00:02:40,178
- [Jeremy] And you guys painted

68
00:02:40,178 --> 00:02:41,476
your fingernails and toenails?

69
00:02:41,476 --> 00:02:43,409
- [Grandma] Yeah.

70
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,992
("O Come All Ye Faithful")

71
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,982
- We're trying to get a Christmas picture

72
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:58,003
with the family.

73
00:02:58,003 --> 00:02:59,755
- It may be too much to ask for.

74
00:02:59,755 --> 00:03:01,255
- [All] Ice cream!

75
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:04,011
- [Grandma] OK, see if Mom likes these.

76
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:04,844
- Pickles!

77
00:03:06,032 --> 00:03:07,707
- So we'd be taking the picture,

78
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:10,971
and one of the kids would
be lifting their dress up,

79
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,107
and the other one would
be picking his nose.

80
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:16,074
- We are finishing up
these brown sugar cookies,

81
00:03:16,074 --> 00:03:18,091
and I'm just so glad
that we got to make them,

82
00:03:18,091 --> 00:03:19,394
especially with my mom.

83
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:21,187
This is definitely a great memory for me

84
00:03:21,187 --> 00:03:23,753
for like every Christmas ever growing up.

85
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:25,691
And I love that we made
brown sugar cookies

86
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,875
instead of regular white sugar cookies.

87
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,856
The flavor is so much more

88
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:31,689
rich.

89
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:33,738
I don't know, they're just amazing.

90
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:34,571
You have to try 'em.

91
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,681
I'll put the recipe in the description box

92
00:03:36,681 --> 00:03:38,218
so that you can try them.

93
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,226
Isaac, you excited to
make cookies with Grandma?

94
00:03:40,226 --> 00:03:41,059
- Yeah.

95
00:03:42,148 --> 00:03:45,181
- K, then we're gonna
flip, just a second here.

96
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:46,210
OK?

97
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
This is the fat part.

98
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:48,201
You gotta roll that fat part.

99
00:03:48,201 --> 00:03:49,034
There we go.

100
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,899
This side is the cutting part,

101
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,373
so we stick it on the edge, OK?

102
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:54,499
You'll leave it sitting right there.

103
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,467
OK, now get the next
one that you wanna do,

104
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:57,300
and we'll put it on the edge--

105
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,769
- A snowman!
- Gotta turn it over.

106
00:03:58,769 --> 00:03:59,710
This is the cutting edge,

107
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,636
so we've gotta turn it over this way.

108
00:04:02,636 --> 00:04:04,228
OK, now leave it sitting there.

109
00:04:04,228 --> 00:04:05,895
OK, get another one.

110
00:04:08,924 --> 00:04:09,757
OK.

111
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:12,731
OK, just gonna have to go right there.

112
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,865
Push down really good.

113
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,369
Now squish 'em.

114
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,115
- [Kendra] Caleb, what are you doing?

115
00:04:17,115 --> 00:04:18,050
- I did it.

116
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,988
- You did it?
- Yay!

117
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:20,821
Look at that!

118
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:23,059
Isn't that cute?
- What did you make?

119
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:24,475
- [Grandma] And now
you wanted the snowman.

120
00:04:24,475 --> 00:04:26,275
There you go.

121
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,354
- And a socking.

122
00:04:28,354 --> 00:04:29,420
- [Kendra] A what?

123
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,746
- And a socking.

124
00:04:30,746 --> 00:04:32,271
- [Kendra] A socking?

125
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,858
- And a socking.

126
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,144
- Aw, he calls 'em sockings.

127
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,676
- Like your sister used to
call 'em wait 'til laters

128
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,749
instead of elevators.

129
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,235
- [Kendra] It's just so cute.

130
00:04:41,235 --> 00:04:42,371
- They're puffy, aren't they?

131
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,865
You see 'em get kind of puffier?

132
00:04:43,865 --> 00:04:45,204
- Are they mine?

133
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,698
- Yeah, which one do you want to frost?

134
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:47,531
Pick one.

135
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:48,944
("Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer")

136
00:04:48,944 --> 00:04:49,777
Good job.

137
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,435
- [Jeremy] Are you frosting?

138
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,268
- Uh huh.

139
00:04:53,268 --> 00:04:54,875
- [Jeremy] See when you frost a cookie,

140
00:04:54,875 --> 00:04:58,208
you rub the frosting on the cookie, see?

141
00:04:59,138 --> 00:05:01,994
(giggles)

142
00:05:01,994 --> 00:05:04,513
(laughs)

143
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,013
Yeah, that's how you put on that frosting.

144
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,416
You're doin' good, Cubby.

145
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:12,722
- I farted.

146
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,889
(giggles)

147
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:17,998
- So back in the day, we would
like have all these different

148
00:05:17,998 --> 00:05:20,220
toppings and colors and piping bags

149
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,695
and we'd decorate these
super ornate cookies

150
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,912
and at this phase in my life,

151
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:26,576
we just put on the frosting
and put on the sprinkles

152
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,222
and call it good.

153
00:05:28,222 --> 00:05:30,983
- [Jeremy] That was a snowman, I think.

154
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:32,552
- [Kendra] Lisey, it's great!

155
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:35,081
(microwave beeps)

156
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:36,319
- [Elise] Ready to eat it?

157
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,872
- [Kendra] No, you're
gonna decorate another one.

158
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,537
- And then eat one?

159
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:41,370
- [Kendra] Yeah.

160
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,203
- Oh.

161
00:05:42,203 --> 00:05:44,264
(festive piano music)

162
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:45,597
- [Kendra] Woah.

163
00:05:46,431 --> 00:05:48,353
Woah, OK, OK, that's enough.

164
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:49,502
- [Isaac] OK.

165
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:52,793
- That's enough, and there is
the finished gingerbread man.

166
00:05:52,793 --> 00:05:55,032
- [Kendra] So it's a Christmas J House.

167
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,769
- [Grandma] Woo hoo! Merry Christmas!

168
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:57,602
- [Kendra] Merry Christmas

169
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:59,200
- This is actually
inspired by Sam Mendias.

170
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,697
Sam made us a logo one time
with a house cookie cutter.

171
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:03,530
It was pretty cool.

172
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,473
I'll show you a picture of it.

173
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:06,969
So that inspired the J House cookie.

174
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:07,802
- Thanks, Sam.

175
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:09,331
So my brother and sister and their spouses

176
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,853
are together in Utah right now,

177
00:06:10,853 --> 00:06:14,310
and so we're Skyping with
them, so come join us.

178
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,970
- We're so far past tired.

179
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,295
- [Kendra] Hey guys, you're on J House.
