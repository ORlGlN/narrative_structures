1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:03,863
- [Jeremy] You might win the whole league.

2
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:05,326
- [Kendra] Is it cold Princess?

3
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:07,788
How could we ever use this much salt?

4
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:09,413
Are you guys excited for our trip?

5
00:00:09,413 --> 00:00:10,690
- Yeah.

6
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,153
- We're gonna be there for a long time.

7
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:14,320
- [Jeremy] Happy New Year!

8
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,498
(techno music)

9
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:23,508
- [Kendra] I love you Mom.

10
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:24,692
- X,X.

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:25,899
- [Kendra] Is that for kisses?

12
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:27,083
- Yeah.

13
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:28,105
- Awesome.

14
00:00:28,105 --> 00:00:29,475
So this morning the kids are playing

15
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,100
with this toy Zoob that we got.

16
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,910
It has been a big hit, I love
that Janae can't choke on

17
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:36,557
the pieces so that kids can
just have it out and playing.

18
00:00:36,557 --> 00:00:37,834
I love how creative it is.

19
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,133
All the kids are doing different
things with it right now.

20
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,155
I'll show you.

21
00:00:41,155 --> 00:00:42,107
What did you make Isaac?

22
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:43,128
- A person.

23
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:44,406
- [Kendra] I love it,
can he actually move?

24
00:00:44,406 --> 00:00:45,239
Cool.

25
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:49,003
- But then his head that just-

26
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:49,920
The splits.

27
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,416
- [Kendra] Nice.

28
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,994
- Look at mine, it's almost done.

29
00:00:54,994 --> 00:00:56,433
- [Kendra] What is it?

30
00:00:56,433 --> 00:00:58,350
- I just need one more.

31
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:04,263
- [Kendra] Nice.

32
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:07,398
Well Laura, this is really cool.

33
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:08,861
And what did you build Caleb?

34
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,393
- A fire.

35
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:13,644
So I basically just made a circle

36
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:17,986
and I put all these up and then
I put yellow and some green.

37
00:01:17,986 --> 00:01:19,960
- [Kendra] I love it.

38
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,884
So here's the toy, it's
called Zoob Builders.

39
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:26,183
We got the 250 piece set.

40
00:01:26,183 --> 00:01:27,460
This is totally not sponsored,

41
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,992
we just really like this toy.

42
00:01:28,992 --> 00:01:30,711
It was a big Christmas hit.

43
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:33,358
So Isaac's made two robot little people.

44
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:34,983
- And I've named them.

45
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:38,559
This one's Rover and this
one's either Gary or Gandalf.

46
00:01:38,559 --> 00:01:41,717
- [Kendra] You guys came
up with the coolest idea.

47
00:01:41,717 --> 00:01:43,435
- It was a big success.

48
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:48,381
- [Kendra] I can't wait to
see the finished product.

49
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,842
- Now we will present the

50
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:52,723
America flag.

51
00:01:52,723 --> 00:01:55,390
- [Kendra] You guys did awesome.

52
00:01:56,554 --> 00:01:58,180
- [Caleb] And we're gonna
have a band after this.

53
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,316
- [Kendra] So they
combined the Zoob pieces

54
00:02:00,316 --> 00:02:02,870
with the Dublo blocks with paper.

55
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,985
Very creative.

56
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:05,517
I love your new glasses.

57
00:02:05,517 --> 00:02:06,539
- Thanks.

58
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:07,654
They show rainbows.

59
00:02:07,654 --> 00:02:10,044
- [Kendra] Yeah, when you
look through the frame?

60
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:12,948
I love that there's flowers on the side.

61
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,480
I love 'em.

62
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,147
- In his first ever.

63
00:02:17,034 --> 00:02:19,867
Pass it to Allen Robinson, tackle.

64
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:25,417
- So I love how deliberate
Kendra was with a lot

65
00:02:25,417 --> 00:02:28,389
of the presents that she
got the kids for Christmas.

66
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:31,036
They aren't the kind of
presents that almost take away

67
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:34,542
imagination because
they're overly processed.

68
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:36,168
These are just building blocks

69
00:02:36,168 --> 00:02:38,118
and then the kids get to make
of them whatever they want.

70
00:02:38,118 --> 00:02:40,672
She was very deliberate in those decisions

71
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:42,228
and it's paying off.

72
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,457
- [Isaac] It is third and five.

73
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:45,966
Down, set, hike.

74
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,049
He passes it.

75
00:02:48,451 --> 00:02:50,076
- [Jeremy] They lose their heads.

76
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,659
(upbeat music)

77
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,691
Here's another one of the presents

78
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:01,501
Kendra got me that I love.

79
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:03,033
Mmmm.

80
00:03:03,033 --> 00:03:04,241
So good.

81
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:07,561
These are little Danish waffle
cookies filled with caramel.

82
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:09,279
Apparently a breakfast item.

83
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,974
So on the picture of these Stroop Waffles,

84
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:13,273
they show it over a cup so I took some

85
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:17,440
hot apple cider and I'm gonna
put the Stroop Waffle on top.

86
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:21,171
It warms up the caramel.

87
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,351
I'm excited.

88
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:27,019
So our entire marriage we've
used this little salt shaker

89
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,922
and this one now feels like a giant.

90
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:32,406
- [Jeremy] Again, we got this
one at a white elephant party

91
00:03:32,406 --> 00:03:34,868
otherwise we wouldn't have
a salt shaker probably.

92
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:37,933
- How could we ever use this much salt?

93
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,488
- [Jeremy] You don't realize how often

94
00:03:39,488 --> 00:03:41,857
I add salt to that little thing.

95
00:03:41,857 --> 00:03:43,668
- I feel like it's like
when you have a new baby

96
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:45,201
and you bring your new baby home

97
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,546
and all of a sudden your
toddler looks like a giant.

98
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:49,546
I'm a giant salt shaker.

99
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:55,603
- [Jeremy] Laura, you
getting ready for church?

100
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,577
- So it's so cold outside today.

101
00:03:57,577 --> 00:04:00,410
- [Jeremy] Is it like negative 12?

102
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,412
- With the wind chill
it's like negative 12.

103
00:04:02,412 --> 00:04:04,200
I think it's really like maybe

104
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,477
seven degrees is the high today.

105
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:07,102
So I didn't want the girls to have

106
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:08,472
to go out with their wet hair.

107
00:04:08,472 --> 00:04:09,587
What is that?

108
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,026
What is that?

109
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:13,163
Do you wanna see what it does?

110
00:04:13,163 --> 00:04:15,413
(laughter)

111
00:04:16,576 --> 00:04:17,690
- [Jeremy] Yay!

112
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,337
- She's like, what was that?

113
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:22,543
If you go outside in
this kind of cold weather

114
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,935
with wet hair, your hair turns to ice.

115
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:26,561
It's so crazy.

116
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,000
- [Jeremy] Lunch for today.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,626
Black olives.

118
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,924
Poll question, do you like black olives?

119
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:34,757
I'm a big fan, Kendra not so much.

120
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:37,219
- [Kendra] How are you
guys feeling back there?

121
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:38,302
- [All] Cold.

122
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,839
- It's colder in here than out there.

123
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,790
- The kids are talking about
how they have goosebumps

124
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,160
all over their body.

125
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,437
Laura, where's your goosebumps?

126
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:47,644
- My nose.

127
00:04:47,644 --> 00:04:50,268
- On her nose and her lips.

128
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:53,426
It is so cold here and we
love living in Kansas City,

129
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,889
we really, really do.

130
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:56,839
But because we home school
and Jeremy works from home,

131
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,302
we have complete flexibility

132
00:04:58,302 --> 00:05:00,601
and so we've decided to escape.

133
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:02,830
During this winter we are
going away for a whole month.

134
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,873
We found a great deal on a rental house

135
00:05:04,873 --> 00:05:07,335
because it's off season
and we are going to be

136
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:10,144
staying somewhere and I
am just giddy about it.

137
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,048
Every morning when I wake up I look at the

138
00:05:12,048 --> 00:05:14,092
weather app for here and
then I swipe to the side

139
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:15,624
and look at the weather app for there

140
00:05:15,624 --> 00:05:18,364
and I'm like, okay, I can do this.

141
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:19,711
Five more days people, five more days.

142
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:21,847
- So I'd love to see in
the comments your guesses,

143
00:05:21,847 --> 00:05:23,821
where are we going?

144
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,400
- And we're gonna be
there for a long time.

145
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,793
Are you guys excited for our trip?

146
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,093
- [All] Yeah.

147
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:29,951
- It's gonna nice and warm

148
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,295
and we'll need to bring our swimsuits.

149
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:36,267
- My favorite part is
that it's gonna be warm.

150
00:05:36,267 --> 00:05:38,844
A lot warmer than here.

151
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,864
- [Kendra] It is cold.

152
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:43,697
Short walk to the church doors.

153
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:45,067
Is it cold Princess?

154
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,414
- Yeah.

155
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,132
- [Kendra] Yeah, okay let's go.

156
00:05:48,132 --> 00:05:49,549
What a gentleman.

157
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:53,519
Well we just go home from
an inspiring church service

158
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,214
and what I loved is
that they focused today

159
00:05:55,214 --> 00:05:57,954
on the fundamentals and how
as we move into the new year

160
00:05:57,954 --> 00:05:59,998
focusing on those simple habits

161
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,227
like prayer and studying from
the scriptures and serving

162
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:04,433
that those are the things that will

163
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,221
bring the real change into our lives.

164
00:06:06,221 --> 00:06:07,846
I just really like that.

165
00:06:07,846 --> 00:06:11,097
Now we're getting ready to
party for New Year's Eve.

166
00:06:11,097 --> 00:06:12,745
We are hosting Jeremy's brother

167
00:06:12,745 --> 00:06:14,510
and sister-in-law and
their family for dinner.

168
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,413
We're cooking dinner and
getting some fun treats ready.

169
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:18,434
Elise, what are you making?

170
00:06:18,434 --> 00:06:19,549
- The apple dip.

171
00:06:19,549 --> 00:06:21,197
- [Kendra] It's berry cream cheese.

172
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:22,614
- Berry cream cheese.

173
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:23,543
- [Kendra] Then what do you mix it with?

174
00:06:23,543 --> 00:06:25,075
- Marshmallow creme.

175
00:06:25,075 --> 00:06:28,163
- [Kendra] Yeah, that's why it's so yummy.

176
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,603
And Caleb, what are
you gonna help me make?

177
00:06:29,603 --> 00:06:31,577
- Chex Mix and golden grahams.

178
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:34,804
- [Kendra] It's a chewy,
gooey Chex mix for dessert.

179
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:36,198
- I'm doing mashed potatoes.

180
00:06:36,198 --> 00:06:39,425
Kendra made a chicken
cordon bleu casserole

181
00:06:39,425 --> 00:06:40,795
which is really good.

182
00:06:40,795 --> 00:06:42,746
- [Kendra] Let's see, it's bubbly.

183
00:06:42,746 --> 00:06:46,252
Caleb's adding butter to the saucepan.

184
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,317
So here's the ingredients of the Chex mix

185
00:06:49,317 --> 00:06:50,942
and now we're just getting the sauce

186
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,078
ingredients ready before we boil them.

187
00:06:53,078 --> 00:06:54,356
- The sauce is the best part.

188
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,236
- [Kendra] Yeah, that's
where all the sugar is.

189
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:57,653
Are you watching?

190
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,801
What's that dance?

191
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:03,690
Oh okay.

192
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,801
Now we need one and a
third cup of Karo syrup

193
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,031
and one and a third cup of sugar.

194
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,074
Where's one cup?

195
00:07:11,074 --> 00:07:12,351
- [Caleb] To there.

196
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:14,069
- [Kendra] There's one cup,
so one and a third cup.

197
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:15,254
- [Caleb] There.

198
00:07:15,254 --> 00:07:17,831
- [Kendra] Yeah, that's it.

199
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:18,748
Who's here?

200
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:20,777
- Cousins!

201
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,216
Cousins!

202
00:07:24,216 --> 00:07:25,726
Cousins!

203
00:07:25,726 --> 00:07:26,809
- Come on in.

204
00:07:28,326 --> 00:07:30,243
- [Kendra] Come inside.

205
00:07:33,342 --> 00:07:36,593
- This stuff is so good and addicting.

206
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:38,056
You don't wanna stop.

207
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,517
- [Kendra] There's coconut,
almonds, Golden Grahams

208
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:42,305
and then Rice Chex in here.

209
00:07:42,305 --> 00:07:43,930
- [Jeremy] And then sugar goo.

210
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,066
- [Kendra] Yeah, sugar
goo, that's where it's at.

211
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,854
Dinner is done.

212
00:07:47,854 --> 00:07:50,083
We've got chicken cordon bleu casserole,

213
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,752
mashed potatoes, rolls, chopped salad

214
00:07:53,752 --> 00:07:55,285
and apples with dip.

215
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:56,910
- I'm so hungry.

216
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,932
- [Kendra] Are you really hungry?

217
00:07:57,932 --> 00:07:58,861
- Yeah, I'm really hungry.

218
00:07:58,861 --> 00:08:00,834
- So we are unfortunately
out of paper plates

219
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:02,622
but we're gonna pretend that it's because

220
00:08:02,622 --> 00:08:04,573
we're super fancy and
since it's New Year's Eve

221
00:08:04,573 --> 00:08:06,221
we wanna have a festive occasion

222
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,568
so we're actually using real plates

223
00:08:07,568 --> 00:08:09,286
which is kind of a big deal
when we have guests over.

224
00:08:09,286 --> 00:08:12,536
- [Jeremy] Getting ready for the party.

225
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,276
- We are going to do a balloon drop.

226
00:08:16,276 --> 00:08:17,808
- [Jeremy] It's gonna be epic.

227
00:08:17,808 --> 00:08:20,391
(techno music)

228
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:25,099
I got ya, she's playing
with them balloons.

229
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,630
Nae-nae hasn't really
engaged with balloons much

230
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,766
so this is a first.

231
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:31,016
Good job Elise.

232
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:33,760
- I tied my first balloon!

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,782
- [Jeremy] All by yourself?

234
00:08:34,782 --> 00:08:35,827
- Yeah!

235
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:37,010
- [Jeremy] I still need Mom's help to do

236
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,891
that most of that time, that's hard.

237
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:39,725
Balloony.

238
00:08:41,491 --> 00:08:44,952
It's not allowed to hit the ground.

239
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:47,251
- So this is Janae's first new years.

240
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,876
She's trying to walk away with it.

241
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:50,153
Here you go big girl.

242
00:08:50,153 --> 00:08:51,849
- [Jeremy] Bang the pot and pan.

243
00:08:51,849 --> 00:08:52,682
Or eat it.

244
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:57,275
- [Kendra] Eat the spoon.

245
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,687
(cheers)

246
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:03,807
I think Janae's too tired to stay up

247
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:05,432
and celebrate with the rest of us

248
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:07,731
so this is her Happy New Year.

249
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:10,471
- [Jeremy] Happy New Year!

250
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,554
(cheers)

251
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:15,765
- She's like, I don't
know what's going on.

252
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:17,298
We're about to get out some family games.

253
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,830
First is Zingo.

254
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,852
- [Jeremy] Train.

255
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:20,781
- [Laura] Train.

256
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:21,802
- [Jeremy] Do you have a train Laura?

257
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,079
- Yes look.

258
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,996
Does anyone have clock?

259
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:30,161
- [Isaac] Now we -

260
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:32,298
- Uh oh, for the cup.

261
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:33,575
- Whoever gets panda first.

262
00:09:33,575 --> 00:09:36,992
- What was your favorite thing from 2017?

263
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:39,078
- Disneyland.

264
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,911
- You like Disneyland?

265
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:45,320
Did you like getting potty trained?

266
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,342
- Yeah.

267
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:47,781
- 'Cause that was a highlight for me.

268
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:49,864
Janae, what did you like?

269
00:09:51,032 --> 00:09:54,980
- I did two math curriculums,
well I'm going to.

270
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,141
- [Kendra] Yeah, you made a ton

271
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:57,511
of progress in math this year.

272
00:09:57,511 --> 00:09:59,229
Well I graded it.

273
00:09:59,229 --> 00:10:00,158
Do you wanna hear the results?

274
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:01,203
- Yeah.

275
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:03,620
- [Kendra] You got 100%!

276
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:07,913
- I really like school.

277
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:09,413
- [Kendra] School?

278
00:10:10,746 --> 00:10:12,371
- [Jeremy] Caleb found his seat.

279
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:14,954
(upbeat music)

280
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,328
- [Kendra] You learned
how to read this year.

281
00:10:25,328 --> 00:10:27,975
- [Jeremy] You read,
you are reading books.

282
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:30,529
- I really like going
on the trip to Seattle,

283
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,666
I've never been to Seattle.

284
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,083
- Goodbye my son.

285
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,194
- [Kendra] There he is, oh my goodness.

286
00:10:37,194 --> 00:10:38,819
- [Jeremy] There he is.

287
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:39,841
Michael.

288
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:40,862
- [Kendra] Alright Michael,

289
00:10:40,862 --> 00:10:41,884
what was your favorite from 2017?

290
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:42,906
- Caleb.

291
00:10:42,906 --> 00:10:44,276
- [Jeremy] Caleb.

292
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,297
(laughter)

293
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:48,037
- My favorite from 2017

294
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:49,732
is an easy one.

295
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,649
It's Janae.

296
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:53,707
Guys, I had a baby.

297
00:10:56,002 --> 00:10:58,092
- [Jeremy] You did amazing, good job.

298
00:10:58,092 --> 00:11:00,675
(upbeat music)

299
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:09,609
The top highlight of the year
for me was Janae being born.

300
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:11,582
But other huge things was
we paid off our house,

301
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:14,392
we have no debt, and I started a law firm.

302
00:11:14,392 --> 00:11:16,389
- [Kendra] Today's the last check.

303
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:18,409
- The last check to the bank.

304
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:21,219
We have a huge announcement.

305
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:22,219
Brent and I,

306
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,818
we're starting a law firm.

307
00:11:24,818 --> 00:11:26,675
So those are really big things.

308
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,301
How about you Uncle Travis?

309
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,367
- In 2017, I published a book.

310
00:11:30,367 --> 00:11:31,714
- [Jeremy] That's awesome.
- My own book.

311
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:32,736
- [Jeremy] I read it.

312
00:11:32,736 --> 00:11:33,850
It was good.

313
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,872
Yeah, Isaac read it.

314
00:11:34,872 --> 00:11:37,705
- Orion is the best book
ever, I recommend it.

315
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,237
- [Jeremy] There you go.

316
00:11:39,237 --> 00:11:40,514
Nine, eight,

317
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:41,431
seven, six,

318
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,219
five, four,

319
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:45,109
three, two

320
00:11:46,064 --> 00:11:47,596
one,

321
00:11:47,596 --> 00:11:49,500
happy new year!

322
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,083
(techno music)

323
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:15,825
- Sparkling white grape
juice, I love this one.

324
00:12:18,479 --> 00:12:20,964
- [Jeremy] The fantasy football results,

325
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,611
he's in the finals right now.

326
00:12:23,611 --> 00:12:25,491
- Can I check the...

327
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:26,676
- [Jeremy] Who's winning?

328
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:27,509
- I am!

329
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,948
- Let me see it.

330
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:31,781
169.

331
00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:34,687
- Everybody's doing-

332
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,187
- [Jeremy] You might win the whole league.

333
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:42,117
- Look at the bar.

334
00:12:42,117 --> 00:12:43,742
- So what's so fun with fantasy football

335
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:45,530
was we did the league because of Isaac

336
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:48,177
and he ended up winning the
whole thing out of 12 of us.

337
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,803
- I won fantasy football.

338
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:50,732
- [Jeremy] You won it.

339
00:12:50,732 --> 00:12:53,482
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

340
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:56,978
- [Kendra] That was kind the face.

341
00:12:56,978 --> 00:12:58,580
- Let's take down the tree.

342
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,625
- [Kendra] What are you making?

343
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,646
- Ice.

344
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,874
- [Kendra] You guys playing laser tag?

345
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:08,041
- [Jeremy] Will it stay on
there if I just keep going?

346
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,857
Look what came in the mail.

347
00:13:12,857 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
