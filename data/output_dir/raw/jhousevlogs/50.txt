1
00:00:00,247 --> 00:00:01,981
- You wanna make something amazing?

2
00:00:01,981 --> 00:00:03,760
- [Jeremy] Isn't it crazy soft?

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,774
Did you make a hammock?

4
00:00:04,774 --> 00:00:05,607
- Yeah.

5
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:08,690
(lighthearted music)

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,410
- [Jeremy] It's really fun.

7
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,650
It's this amazing fort.

8
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,317
- [Kendra] Mango tart for dessert.

9
00:00:16,317 --> 00:00:19,400
(lighthearted music)

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,600
- So in the mornings we've
been having our kids do

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,400
a gratitude journal
before they eat breakfast

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,440
and I've decided recently
to do the same thing.

13
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,340
And I'm sure you've noticed
every morning that I'm like

14
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,560
showing the sunrise out here, but

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,030
I'm just so grateful for that.

16
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,356
Like, it's amazing how much peace and joy

17
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:39,520
it's bringing me and being here right now,

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,810
I'm just taking the time
every morning to watch it.

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,610
And same thing with the sunset.

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,290
It's just a really
beautiful and amazing thing

21
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,410
that I'm grateful for.

22
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,560
I would love to hear in the
comments some of the things

23
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,046
that you are grateful for.

24
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:52,412
- Bag, clothes,

25
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:53,672
planes,

26
00:00:53,672 --> 00:00:55,381
curtains, baby.

27
00:00:55,381 --> 00:00:56,756
That's what I'm grateful for.

28
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,770
I wanna test out my workout clothes,

29
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,570
so we are going on a run.

30
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,830
- [Jeremy] We're gonna do a whole workout.

31
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:02,663
- Yeah.

32
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:05,432
(energetic music)

33
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:11,679
(laughing)

34
00:01:13,053 --> 00:01:15,886
(energetic music)

35
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,455
- [Jeremy] Work it!

36
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,288
Push it!

37
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,339
Running uphill is such a good workout.

38
00:01:35,339 --> 00:01:36,827
So what did you think of running hills?

39
00:01:36,827 --> 00:01:37,761
- It's fun,

40
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:38,740
and

41
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,751
tiring.

42
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:40,964
- [Jeremy] It's hard work, huh?

43
00:01:40,964 --> 00:01:43,115
- Yeah! You can get up!

44
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,091
You can get up!

45
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:45,280
- [Jeremy] This is Elise's
first time climbing up

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,272
all by herself.

47
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,021
Good job big girl.

48
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:49,182
- So you can learn all the skills.

49
00:01:49,182 --> 00:01:51,220
Like if you don't wanna
get poked in all the

50
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,275
prickly stuff, you can go over them.

51
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:55,055
- [Jeremy] All right, who
wants to go somewhere awesome?

52
00:01:55,055 --> 00:01:56,210
- Me!
- Me!

53
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,173
- [Jeremy] Okay, let's go!

54
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:58,650
(lighthearted music)

55
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,640
- So today we're headed
to the Children's Museum

56
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,660
in San Diego.

57
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,440
We love visiting new Children's Museums.

58
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,080
They're always so interactive,
and just really great

59
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,486
for all the ages of our kids.

60
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,423
(lighthearted music)

61
00:02:10,423 --> 00:02:11,980
Whoa!

62
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,929
- [Jeremy] Do you see that?

63
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:17,470
- [Caleb] That thing is floating!

64
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,390
- [Isaac] Is it helium?

65
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,929
- [Kendra] It's a balloon sculpture.

66
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:21,130
I don't think it's helium.

67
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:24,213
(lighthearted music)

68
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,942
- [Caleb] Let's see how fast you can go.

69
00:02:28,942 --> 00:02:31,692
(chimes playing)

70
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:34,592
- [Kendra] Laura's teaching Jenae.

71
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:37,740
There she is, she's following you!

72
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:40,597
There she is!

73
00:02:40,597 --> 00:02:41,857
You did it!

74
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,557
I'm so proud of you!

75
00:02:43,557 --> 00:02:46,390
(energetic music)

76
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:54,170
(lighthearted music)

77
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,900
- [Jeremy] Just ropes
everywhere, climbing,

78
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,730
and it's really fun.

79
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,596
It's this amazing fort.

80
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,679
(lighthearted music)

81
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,410
- [Jeremy] Okay, what's going on in here?

82
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,950
Sensory madness?

83
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:22,779
(laughing)

84
00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:29,403
- [Kendra] He's gone.

85
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,690
And he's back,

86
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,003
and he's gone.

87
00:03:33,003 --> 00:03:34,010
(laughing)

88
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,743
- [Jeremy] Come here, I
wanna show you something.

89
00:03:35,743 --> 00:03:37,130
It's a magic trick.

90
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,750
- [Kendra] Where'd he go?

91
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,819
- It's a whole circle!

92
00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:53,357
- I know.

93
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:54,690
- And here I am.

94
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:58,439
(fun music)

95
00:04:02,504 --> 00:04:05,337
(excited yelling)

96
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,036
- [Jeremy] Ah!

97
00:04:08,036 --> 00:04:08,953
Two of 'em!

98
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,570
Oh, it's Elise is in there!

99
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,716
Well apparently we could have
fun all day with just that.

100
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,760
(energetic music)

101
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,643
- [Kendra] Hi Elise.

102
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:23,476
- Hi.

103
00:04:23,476 --> 00:04:24,309
- Did you find a house?

104
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:28,351
(energetic music)

105
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:37,881
- [Jeremy] Did you make a hammock?

106
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:39,090
- Yeah.

107
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,694
- [Jeremy] I hope it holds you.

108
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:43,527
(energetic music)

109
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,604
Can I see what you drew?

110
00:04:52,604 --> 00:04:53,600
Awesome.

111
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,550
- I think these are the best things

112
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,410
that I've drawn in a long time.

113
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:58,882
- [Jeremy] It's fun that
you can trace it, huh?

114
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:01,715
(classical music)

115
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,055
- Queen

116
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,187
Laura

117
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:07,599
of Kansas City.

118
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,432
(classical music)

119
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:31,900
- We got paint on our shoes.

120
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,110
- [Jeremy] Yeah, luckily
it's washable paint.

121
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,943
(energetic music)

122
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,194
- What are you making?
- Stuff.

123
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:42,520
- [Caleb] What is the Raiders?

124
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,080
- Stuff?

125
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,278
- Pretty stuff.

126
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:48,111
(energetic music)

127
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:58,964
- Hi!

128
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,056
- You wanna make something amazing?

129
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:05,889
(energetic music)

130
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,684
- [Jeremy] Have you found yours?

131
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:34,517
- No.

132
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,080
- [Jeremy] All right now, look for it!

133
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:49,340
- [Laura] Is that mine?

134
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,360
- [Jeremy] Nope, that's Lisie's.

135
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,193
Do you see it?

136
00:06:53,488 --> 00:06:56,310
Oooh, no one's in here except one person.

137
00:06:58,207 --> 00:06:59,040
- Wow!

138
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,540
- So they have this sand box here that is

139
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,010
super fine sand that the kids can play in.

140
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,917
Isn't is crazy soft?

141
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:08,075
- Yeah.

142
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,825
(relaxing music)

143
00:07:14,304 --> 00:07:18,721
- It's not real sand, but
it's softer than real sand.

144
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:20,950
- [Laura] I did it!

145
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,900
- [Jeremy] Nay-nay!

146
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,356
She loves it.

147
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:25,330
- [Caleb] Yeah!

148
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,620
The colors change.

149
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,890
- Do you like my elevations?

150
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:32,240
- This is really cool sand.

151
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,640
I'm not a fan of sand,
but this is so soft.

152
00:07:36,084 --> 00:07:37,697
- Whoa, that's a volcano.

153
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:38,530
- Uh-huh.

154
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,299
(lighthearted music)

155
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:41,999
- Thank you Miss Laura.

156
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:45,082
(lighthearted music)

157
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,830
- So after leaving the Children's Museum

158
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,012
we found a park across
the street that looks fun.

159
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:56,095
(lighthearted music)

160
00:08:04,774 --> 00:08:07,607
(energetic music)

161
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,187
- Quack!

162
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:15,020
(energetic music)

163
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,340
- So our side of the freeway
is flowing great right now.

164
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,460
We're driving quickly.

165
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,610
The other side of the
freeway was all stopped up

166
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,760
and I always feel bad.

167
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,540
Like I feel guilty when that happens.

168
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,230
So we're headed to a fun place to eat.

169
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,430
It's called Urban Place.

170
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,590
I've actually been there before,

171
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,440
but the kids haven't,

172
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,263
so we're gonna let them try it.

173
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,346
(lighthearted music)

174
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,891
So we are sharing this
mango tart for dessert.

175
00:08:56,891 --> 00:08:58,260
- What's a tart?

176
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,144
- A tart is this yummy,
thin pie crust right here.

177
00:09:02,144 --> 00:09:03,020
- Mmm!

178
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,592
- And then it's got
mangoes and this cream.

179
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:06,452
- [Caleb] Goodnight.

180
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:07,980
J House out.

181
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,980
- [Jeremy] All right, we're
jumping into the presents.

182
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,578
Is this the present you got for her?

183
00:09:11,578 --> 00:09:12,578
- Thank you!

184
00:09:13,642 --> 00:09:15,809
(giggles)

185
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:17,840
