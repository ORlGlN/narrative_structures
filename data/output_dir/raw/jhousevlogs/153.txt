00:00:00,328 --> 00:00:02,734
(kids laughing)

2
00:00:02,734 --> 00:00:05,467
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,467 --> 00:00:07,271
- [Kendra] One, two, three.

4
00:00:07,271 --> 00:00:09,854
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:14,293 --> 00:00:15,855
Hello.

6
00:00:15,855 --> 00:00:17,123
Why are you doing that?

7
00:00:17,123 --> 00:00:18,329
- I don't know.

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:19,162
Excuse me.

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,406
- [Kendra] That looks
like a little mouth now.

10
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:23,818
(kids laughing)

11
00:00:23,818 --> 00:00:25,122
You look like you're a vacuum.

12
00:00:25,122 --> 00:00:27,789
(kids laughing)

13
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:35,477
You guys sure make life interesting.

14
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,068
- Can I have my nose back?

15
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:38,660
- [Kendra] Caleb, are you sure
that doesn't hurt your nose?

16
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,525
- No.

17
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:42,321
- [Kendra] That really
looks like it would hurt.

18
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:44,733
- I didn't know noses could move.

19
00:00:44,733 --> 00:00:46,450
- [Kendra] It's 'cuz your nose
doesn't have a bone in it.

20
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,253
It's made out of wiggly cartilage.

21
00:00:49,253 --> 00:00:52,437
(kids laughing)

22
00:00:52,437 --> 00:00:53,600
Your nose can move.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,183
Can your nose move?

24
00:00:57,716 --> 00:01:00,299
(upbeat music)

25
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:09,962
(singing without words)

26
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:16,730
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:25,017 --> 00:01:26,663
- You guys wanna help unload it up now?

28
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:27,861
- Yeah!

29
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,444
(upbeat music)

30
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:39,272
(paper crinkling)

31
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:42,440
- [Jeremy] What are you making?

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,456
- A old sheet of paper

33
00:01:44,456 --> 00:01:46,289
for a little notebook.

34
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:50,391
I'm making a story of the Oregon Trail.

35
00:01:51,781 --> 00:01:52,986
- [Jeremy] Is that like a pioneer journal?

36
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:55,918
- Uh huh and this is the outside,

37
00:01:55,918 --> 00:01:57,398
so I can make it old.

38
00:01:57,398 --> 00:01:58,730
- [Jeremy] So, it's gonna look really old?

39
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,166
- Mmm hmm.

40
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,749
(upbeat music)

41
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:12,487
- [Caleb] Whoops-a-daisies.

42
00:02:12,487 --> 00:02:14,316
(baby squealing)

43
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:16,104
- [Kendra] Wanna try it?

44
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:18,253
Put it in your mouth.

45
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:19,476
What do you think?

46
00:02:19,476 --> 00:02:21,851
So, today Jenae's trying
out this mesh feeder

47
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:22,971
for the first time.

48
00:02:22,971 --> 00:02:24,616
I put some carrot sticks in there,

49
00:02:24,616 --> 00:02:27,366
which I know are not super juicy,

50
00:02:28,914 --> 00:02:30,806
but they're really cold and I thought

51
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,765
that might feel good on her teething gums

52
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:35,313
and you can still get
the flavor through it.

53
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,852
She's unimpressed.

54
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,502
Aw, man.

55
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:39,575
Teether down.

56
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:41,279
(kids laughing)

57
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:43,862
(upbeat music)

58
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,016
- So, we're here at the
library for Elise's tutoring

59
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:53,098
and the boys are checking out books.

60
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,681
(upbeat music)

61
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:03,013
- So, today is my once a month

62
00:03:03,013 --> 00:03:04,570
freezer cooking club that I go to.

63
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,640
I go for two hours and
I make tons of meals.

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,894
I think this time I'm making 18

65
00:03:07,894 --> 00:03:08,777
different meals to take home.

66
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:09,813
That should feed us for a month,

67
00:03:09,813 --> 00:03:11,115
which I'm really grateful for.

68
00:03:11,115 --> 00:03:12,533
Laura is my helper for today.

69
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:13,461
We'll see how that goes.

70
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,143
Miss Laura, where are we going?

71
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:16,005
- To bake.

72
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:17,025
- [Kendra] To cook?

73
00:03:17,025 --> 00:03:18,353
We're gonna go make dinner, huh?

74
00:03:18,353 --> 00:03:20,190
What did we bring with us?

75
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,815
- Our aprons.

76
00:03:21,815 --> 00:03:23,699
- [Kendra] Our aprons.

77
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:27,407
- Yep, so that we can
keep our shirts all clean.

78
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,240
- [Kendra] Yep.

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,364
All right, missy, count out 12 bags.

80
00:03:30,364 --> 00:03:31,197
- One.

81
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:34,029
- [Kendra] Make a pile.

82
00:03:35,135 --> 00:03:35,968
- Two.

83
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:38,208
Three.

84
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:42,562
- [Kendra] Laura's putting
smiley faces on all the bags.

85
00:03:42,562 --> 00:03:43,569
There you go.

86
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:46,152
(upbeat music)

87
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:50,276
All right, we're gonna grab the cheese.

88
00:03:50,276 --> 00:03:52,786
Look for some big bags of white cheese.

89
00:03:52,786 --> 00:03:55,369
(upbeat music)

90
00:03:57,864 --> 00:03:58,977
Good job.

91
00:03:58,977 --> 00:03:59,810
Way to go.

92
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,390
Okay, carry it to our table.

93
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,973
I'll shut the door.

94
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,927
- She's so tired,

95
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:13,235
but Elise is gonna be
done in about five minutes

96
00:04:13,235 --> 00:04:15,344
and I want her to fall asleep in the car

97
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:19,237
on the ride home, not
in my arms right now,

98
00:04:19,237 --> 00:04:22,438
but I don't know if I can keep her awake.

99
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:23,355
Jenae, hey.

100
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,463
Hey.

101
00:04:27,527 --> 00:04:29,868
Yeah, you're sleepy.

102
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,285
Whoops-a-daisies.

103
00:04:32,343 --> 00:04:33,176
Oh.

104
00:04:34,468 --> 00:04:35,301
Oh.

105
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,888
Oh.

106
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:38,783
- Okay, we're finishing up.

107
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,854
We made 12 batches of this
pest chicken casserole.

108
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,185
It's one of our favorites.

109
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:44,756
So, how did you like cooking club?

110
00:04:44,756 --> 00:04:45,647
- Good.

111
00:04:45,647 --> 00:04:46,597
- Laura's been a great helper.

112
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:47,430
Well, we did it.

113
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,453
I've got now 18 homemade
meals that are delicious

114
00:04:51,453 --> 00:04:52,865
and wonderful and will feed our family

115
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,511
for the next month.

116
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:55,485
- [Kendra] How did it go?

117
00:04:55,485 --> 00:04:56,986
- Good.

118
00:04:56,986 --> 00:04:58,750
- Are you ready to go
take a nap, big girl?

119
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,333
(upbeat music)

120
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,921
- So, this morning I had a little bit

121
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,498
of a rough start to the day.

122
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:07,375
Here's what happened.

123
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,716
Last night, when I was going to bed,

124
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:09,776
I set a goal.

125
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,770
I was like, I'm gonna
get up 15 minutes earlier

126
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,586
and I'm gonna get going and
it's gonna be this great day

127
00:05:14,586 --> 00:05:16,323
and I had this vision in my mind

128
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:18,495
of all this awesomeness
I was gonna accomplish

129
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:21,094
early in the morning and it didn't happen.

130
00:05:21,094 --> 00:05:23,379
And it's easy for me
to feel like a failure.

131
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:25,899
Like, ugh, Kendra, you should
have pushed yourself harder.

132
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,336
Kendra, why are you so lame

133
00:05:27,336 --> 00:05:28,318
and you can't get up in the morning?

134
00:05:28,318 --> 00:05:29,765
Like, it's easy for me to let that

135
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,327
kind of self-talk creep in

136
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:34,155
and just feel like a failure
and feel like giving up,

137
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:37,290
but I'm aware that if I let myself

138
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,014
sit in those feelings,

139
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:41,185
it's just gonna drag
the rest of my day down

140
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:42,184
and the day is still young.

141
00:05:42,184 --> 00:05:43,559
We're still just getting going.

142
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:45,566
So, I'm trying really hard to choose

143
00:05:45,566 --> 00:05:47,492
to have grace with myself and say,

144
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:48,984
you know what, Kendra, you're trying,

145
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:50,798
you're moving in a good
direction, you know,

146
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:52,937
you can keep trying tomorrow, you know,

147
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:55,691
a bad morning doesn't make a bad day.

148
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,640
Keep going, you can do this.

149
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,691
So, Laura is deeply asleep.

150
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,137
I can't seem to wake her up.

151
00:06:01,137 --> 00:06:03,566
So, we come home after our cooking group

152
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:04,983
and she wanted to take a little nap

153
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:06,005
and I was doing school with the kids,

154
00:06:06,005 --> 00:06:07,281
so I was like, that's fine,

155
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,560
but I can't let her sleep long

156
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,971
or else she's never
gonna go to bed tonight.

157
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,605
So, after she was asleep for a little bit,

158
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,588
I came in and I opened the blinds,

159
00:06:13,588 --> 00:06:15,818
then we vacuumed her room,

160
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:18,086
then I sent each of the
kids individually in

161
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,433
to try to wake her up.

162
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,336
Now, I'm sitting on the
bed with Jenae and her

163
00:06:21,336 --> 00:06:23,577
and I'm like rubbing her back,

164
00:06:23,577 --> 00:06:25,189
I'm like taking off her blankets,

165
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,939
and she is so asleep.

166
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:30,419
Hey, Laura.

167
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:35,908
Do you wanna come play?

168
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:36,741
No?

169
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:38,776
Do you wanna come have a snack?

170
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:41,943
Do you wanna come help me cook dinner?

171
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,320
So, poll question for the day,

172
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,075
are you a heavy sleeper, a light sleeper,

173
00:06:47,075 --> 00:06:48,162
or somewhere in between?

174
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:49,627
I am a really heavy sleeper.

175
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:52,340
I could probably sleep through
people vacuuming my room

176
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,706
and people trying to wake me up.

177
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:54,925
In fact, I have.

178
00:06:54,925 --> 00:06:56,876
Jeremy, on the other hand, he's not.

179
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:57,794
- So, for dinner tonight,

180
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:00,516
Kendra made some meatloaf and potatoes.

181
00:07:00,516 --> 00:07:01,546
It smells really good.

182
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,379
- [Kendra] I couldn't wait.

183
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,897
I took a bite of the roll.

184
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:05,480
- What is meatloaf?

185
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,936
- Meatloaf is like ground beef

186
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:11,277
mixed with other stuff and then cooked.

187
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:12,341
- [Caleb] Like this.

188
00:07:12,341 --> 00:07:13,174
- Mmm.

189
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,876
- I want more bacon.

190
00:07:15,876 --> 00:07:17,177
- [Jeremy] You mean meatloaf?

191
00:07:17,177 --> 00:07:18,429
- [Kendra] It's called meatloaf.

192
00:07:18,429 --> 00:07:19,785
- Meatloaf is one of
those foods that's hard

193
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:22,621
to cook just right and
this is cooked just right.

194
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:23,454
You nailed it.

195
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,904
It's perfectly cooked

196
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,435
'cuz it's not too dry.

197
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:27,268
It's good.

198
00:07:27,268 --> 00:07:29,082
- I love it.

199
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,580
- You love it?
- Look at my plate.

200
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,701
Right here.

201
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,099
- [Kendra] Already gone.

202
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,766
- I guess it's time to
go bye-bye, meatloaf.

203
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:39,165
- [Kendra] Hi.

204
00:07:40,175 --> 00:07:42,592
You playing with your sister?

205
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:48,016
(kids laughing)

206
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,060
What are you guys playing, Laura?

207
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,647
- Tickle monster.

208
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:55,230
(upbeat music)

209
00:07:58,223 --> 00:07:59,523
(Jenae squealing)

210
00:07:59,523 --> 00:08:01,430
- Is Laura making you laugh?

211
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,990
(Jenae and Laura squealing)

212
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:06,346
I just wanted to tell you guys,

213
00:08:06,346 --> 00:08:08,306
in our vlogs right now,

214
00:08:08,306 --> 00:08:11,551
Jenae is exactly the same age as Laura was

215
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:13,387
when we very first started vlogging.

216
00:08:13,387 --> 00:08:15,822
So, if you want to see
how much they look alike,

217
00:08:15,822 --> 00:08:17,142
which is absolutely incredible,

218
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,304
you need to go back and watch

219
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:19,797
one of our first couple of vlogs.

220
00:08:19,797 --> 00:08:21,780
I think the first one's called first vlog.

221
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,243
There's a few of them in there
right at the very beginning

222
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,789
and they just look so
much alike, it's crazy.

223
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:28,321
- Today, I heard a touching news report

224
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:30,217
where they were talking about how

225
00:08:30,217 --> 00:08:32,352
before the hurricanes that hit,

226
00:08:32,352 --> 00:08:34,525
we've been so divided in our country

227
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:38,358
over things like race,
or income, or politics,

228
00:08:39,245 --> 00:08:40,320
but with the natural disasters,

229
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,758
with this focus on
surviving and the emergency,

230
00:08:42,758 --> 00:08:44,992
a lot of those differences seem to go away

231
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:47,577
and the focus becomes on loving each other

232
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,761
and helping and giving for support

233
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:52,305
and how, if you were stuck
on the top of you roof

234
00:08:52,305 --> 00:08:53,494
with water all around you,

235
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:55,851
you wouldn't care what
race or how much money

236
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:58,329
the person had that came to save you.

237
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,190
I just hope that that's
something we can carry with us.

238
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,936
That's such a beautiful
message and a reminder

239
00:09:01,936 --> 00:09:04,336
that we can love more than fight

240
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,333
and that we can focus on our similarities

241
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,480
rather than so much of our differences

242
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,878
and come to understand each other better

243
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,338
and love each other more.

244
00:09:12,338 --> 00:09:14,443
- This is my book.

245
00:09:14,443 --> 00:09:15,866
- It looks old.

246
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,664
- Yep, it is old.

247
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:19,247
Hi, my name is Mary

248
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:23,116
and my brother is 17 years old.

249
00:09:24,465 --> 00:09:25,754
Then, here's her.

250
00:09:25,754 --> 00:09:26,885
- Does she have boots on?

251
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:27,718
- Yep.

252
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,283
- Looks really old.

253
00:09:29,283 --> 00:09:30,578
Super old.

254
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,161
(upbeat music)

255
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,263
- [Jeremy] You coming
to play some soccer too?

256
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,216
Good thing.

257
00:09:40,216 --> 00:09:42,549
Those are your soccer socks?

258
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:45,161
Ooh, good try.

259
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:46,488
It's Jenae, she's walking.

260
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:48,311
- Hi, Nay-Nay!

261
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:49,512
Hi!

262
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:50,486
Nay-Nay!

263
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,399
- So, I don't know if Jeremy
already told you guys,

264
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,459
but he was driving Isaac to
Isaac's first soccer practice

265
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:58,144
for the season tonight
and on the way there

266
00:09:58,144 --> 00:10:00,254
I checked my email and I called Jeremy

267
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:01,946
and I was like, hey, it
actually got canceled

268
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:03,456
and Isaac was obviously disappointed

269
00:10:03,456 --> 00:10:05,897
and so, Jeremy came home and instead of us

270
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,286
just being, like, hey, bud, it's canceled

271
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,302
and not doing anything,

272
00:10:09,302 --> 00:10:12,023
Jeremy got all the kids
outside and geared up

273
00:10:12,023 --> 00:10:13,545
and they're all playing soccer.

274
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,599
These are some of the moments
when I love Jeremy the most.

275
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,793
Like, I absolutely love
watching him out there

276
00:10:17,793 --> 00:10:19,665
playing with all of our kids

277
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,264
and he has tons of work to do right now

278
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:22,922
and I know he's stressed about it,

279
00:10:22,922 --> 00:10:24,622
but he saw that Isaac was discouraged

280
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:25,912
and the weather's gorgeous

281
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,627
and this is so great for all of our kids

282
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,032
to get out there and be playing with him.

283
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,981
Anyway, it means a later work
night for Jeremy tonight,

284
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:36,357
but I'm so grateful he's
managing that supportive spirit.

285
00:10:36,357 --> 00:10:37,947
(kids laughing)

286
00:10:37,947 --> 00:10:39,224
One, two three.

287
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:40,916
There they are!

288
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,499
(upbeat music)

289
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:45,732
- Oh, I almost made it!

290
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:46,829
I almost made it.

291
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,295
- [Jeremy] Good job.

292
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:49,128
Good job, Laura.

293
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:50,128
You made it.

294
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,415
(cheering)

295
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:56,508
- So, Jenae was absolutely screeching

296
00:10:56,508 --> 00:10:57,582
inside from the window.

297
00:10:57,582 --> 00:10:59,508
Like, she wanted to be outside so badly,

298
00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,931
so I brought her little high
chair out here onto the deck

299
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:04,053
and she's happy as can be.

300
00:11:04,053 --> 00:11:06,215
You watching everybody?

301
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:08,798
(upbeat music)

302
00:11:09,677 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, so close!

303
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:16,981
(cheering)

304
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:17,991
(Kendra laughing)

305
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:19,135
- Yay!

306
00:11:19,135 --> 00:11:20,802
We won three points!

307
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:25,132
- [Jeremy] What you doing?

308
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:26,743
- Squirting.

309
00:11:26,743 --> 00:11:29,293
- [Jeremy] You getting clean?

310
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:33,039
- Nope, I need to clean
my Barbie with soap.

311
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,724
(babbling and laughing)

312
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:39,122
- There's just a lot of
silliness around here tonight.

313
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:42,101
- [Jeremy] Apparently, it's bedtime.

314
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,927
- They're gonna go right
to sleep, no problem.

315
00:11:43,927 --> 00:11:46,255
- [Jeremy] So, Kendra
just read Harry Potter.

316
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:47,880
- Yeah, the chapters are kinda long,

317
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,120
but we made some progress and it's good.

318
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,905
So, we're getting there.

319
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,316
- [Jeremy] They're ganging
up on their brother.

320
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:59,149
(kids laughing and screaming)

321
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,772
- Come give Jenae-nay hugs.

322
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:08,010
- [Jeremy] Kendra was
just saying to the kids,

323
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,414
can they remember what life was like

324
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:12,315
before we had Jenae in our family?

325
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,473
It's hard to even imagine it now.

326
00:12:13,473 --> 00:12:14,306
- I know.

327
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:17,543
And it was wonderful, but
it wasn't quite as wonderful

328
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:19,043
as it is with her.

329
00:12:19,964 --> 00:12:22,168
- And point them.

330
00:12:22,168 --> 00:12:24,467
And flex your toes.

331
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:29,132
Now, lift them again just
six inches off the ground

332
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,643
and drop them.

333
00:12:30,643 --> 00:12:33,456
Now, take in a deep breath

334
00:12:33,456 --> 00:12:34,706
and let it out.

335
00:12:37,128 --> 00:12:38,878
Take in a deep breath

336
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:42,257
and let it out.

337
00:12:42,257 --> 00:12:46,424
Now, turn your fingers into
a tight fist and release.

338
00:12:49,239 --> 00:12:51,522
- We are attempting some yoga before bed

339
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,229
to help calm these kids down

340
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:56,374
'cuz they are a little wild.

341
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,207
Goodnight.

342
00:12:57,207 --> 00:12:58,064
J-house out.

343
00:12:58,064 --> 00:12:59,802
So, today's a big day for this girl.

344
00:12:59,802 --> 00:13:01,843
Who wants to help feed Jenae?
- Me!

345
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:03,128
- [Kendra] Do you know
what's happening here?

346
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:04,363
She likes it.

347
00:13:04,363 --> 00:13:05,929
- [Jeremy] Elise is gonna try some

348
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:07,809
of what Jenae's been eating.

349
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:08,953
- Everybody get in the wagon.

350
00:13:08,953 --> 00:13:11,515
(kids screaming and laughing)

351
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:13,064
- [Kendra] I got you a surprise.

352
00:13:13,064 --> 00:00:00,000
(Jeremy gasping)
