1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
- I think this next one is gonna get 'em.

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:02,903
(funky music)

3
00:00:02,903 --> 00:00:04,380
(running water)

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:05,530
- [Kendra] April Fools!

5
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,730
- Okay for this next prank,

6
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:12,030
I'm gonna have Isaac and
Elise to help me out.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,059
Nae Nae, you wanna help me with the prank?

8
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm trying to put this upside down

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,913
on the table with the water inside.

10
00:00:24,388 --> 00:00:26,280
Okay, here we go.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,947
(playful music)

12
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:47,570
(babbling)

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,240
So we've pulled a lot of
fun pranks on the kids

14
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,340
over the years.

15
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,118
We have a special breakfast
treat for you this morning.

16
00:00:54,118 --> 00:00:56,955
(children gasp)

17
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:57,968
- What?

18
00:00:57,968 --> 00:00:59,470
- What?

19
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,401
- It's April Fools.

20
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:03,484
It's a onion.

21
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:06,415
(Kendra laughs)

22
00:01:06,415 --> 00:01:09,165
- I'm glad I didn't eat an onion.

23
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:12,123
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

24
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:13,251
- [Jeremy] So what happened?

25
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:14,084
- I don't know.

26
00:01:14,084 --> 00:01:15,559
- We got mustached.

27
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:17,946
- You got mustached?

28
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,613
(Kendra yells)

29
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:23,310
Today, we are celebrating April Fools,

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:25,670
but it's not actually April Fools.

31
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,420
This year, Easter falls on
the same day as April Fools

32
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,590
and we didn't want to do both of them

33
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,423
at the same time

34
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,910
and we didn't want the kids to know

35
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,520
that all these pranks were coming,

36
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,580
so it should be a fun day.

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,790
Hey Elise, your chore this morning

38
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,718
is to clean up the table.

39
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:41,160
- Okay.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,539
How will I do that?

41
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,240
- [Jeremy] Just make sure
to clear off all the cups

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,090
and wipe it down.

43
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:51,710
(playful music)

44
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,543
- Whoa.

45
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,472
- [Jeremy] Just clear off the table, okay?

46
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:56,305
- Okay.

47
00:01:56,305 --> 00:01:58,630
(cascading water)

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,540
- [Jeremy] What happened?

49
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,708
You made a mess.

50
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:02,320
- It came all the way around.

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,560
- [Jeremy] Okay, well get
the other cups off the table.

52
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,317
- How did that happen?

53
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,965
I'm kinda afraid to do this one.

54
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,100
- [Jeremy] Well why don't
you see if the other kids

55
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,103
can help you with it.

56
00:02:14,103 --> 00:02:14,936
- Okay.

57
00:02:16,705 --> 00:02:17,657
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

58
00:02:17,657 --> 00:02:19,061
- I'm trying to clear off the table

59
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,164
and get the cups off.

60
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:23,530
- [Jeremy] What do you think Caleb?

61
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,110
How can we get the cup cleaned up?

62
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,440
- I though about turning it around.

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
- I don't know.

64
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,133
Try turning it around.

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,930
- But then it will make a spilled mess.

66
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,823
- Maybe not.

67
00:02:38,277 --> 00:02:39,110
- See?

68
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:40,650
- It's dripping everywhere.

69
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,040
What should we do?

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,433
- How did this happen?

71
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,460
- This is so cool.

72
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,234
And hard to clean up.

73
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:49,067
- [Jeremy] Well, clean it up,

74
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,945
get the cups all cleaned up.

75
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:52,604
- Okay.

76
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:53,975
(splashing)

77
00:02:53,975 --> 00:02:55,640
- [Jeremy] That was pretty good.

78
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,587
Thanks for cleaning up the table Elise.

79
00:02:57,587 --> 00:02:58,630
- Mmm-hmm.

80
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,301
How did that even happen?

81
00:03:00,301 --> 00:03:01,134
- [Jeremy] I don't
know, what do you think,

82
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:02,239
how does that happen?

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,336
- Surface tension?

84
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,565
- [Jeremy] Surface tension?

85
00:03:04,565 --> 00:03:06,810
- Did you turn it over?

86
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,770
- How did you get it on there upside down?

87
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,603
- [Jeremy] I don't know,
if you want to try it,

88
00:03:10,603 --> 00:03:11,600
you can try to figure it out.

89
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,710
Who wants to try it?

90
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,703
- Me!
- Me!

91
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,803
- I got a little.

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,900
(Jeremy laughs)

93
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,463
- [Jeremy] Very little.

94
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,757
Cubby, you want to try it?

95
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,499
(splashing)

96
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:27,832
- What the heck?

97
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,630
- [Jeremy] Taking your socks off?

98
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,463
- [Isaac] Yeah.

99
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,643
- [Jeremy] Nope.

100
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,383
Here comes Laura.

101
00:03:43,244 --> 00:03:45,900
We are making a big mess peeps.

102
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,913
There's water everywhere.

103
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,140
Nae Nae, what's going on?

104
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,037
Alright, you guys want
to see how I did it?

105
00:03:53,037 --> 00:03:53,870
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

106
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,819
♪ Ring around the rosie ♪

107
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,497
♪ (Sped up) Pocket full of posies ♪

108
00:03:58,497 --> 00:04:02,497

109
00:04:06,259 --> 00:04:08,926
(playful music)

110
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,884
- [Jeremy] Alright everybody.

111
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:26,822
Whoa, I almost dropped it.

112
00:04:26,822 --> 00:04:28,400
- Do we have to stir it up more?

113
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,693
- [Jeremy] No I think it's good.

114
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,107
It's just a little frothy on top.

115
00:04:31,107 --> 00:04:33,517
(Janae babbling)

116
00:04:33,517 --> 00:04:35,203
- [Caleb] It smells like cheese.

117
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,010
- [Jeremy] Do you like it?

118
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:43,010
- It takes like water with powder in it.

119
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,060
- Did you use the cheese
stuff inside of this?

120
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,037
- [Jeremy] What do you think Laura?

121
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:48,870
- I hate it.

122
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,864
- [Jeremy] Give it one more big drink.

123
00:04:50,864 --> 00:04:51,697
- Gross.

124
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:52,750
- Is today April Fools?

125
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,667
- [Jeremy] April Fools.

126
00:04:55,516 --> 00:04:57,140
- Yay, I go it.

127
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,080
I knew it, I knew it.

128
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,740
- [Jeremy] Yeah, Caleb caught us,

129
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,240
there's no question about it.

130
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,271
- When I first tasted it,

131
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,860
I was like Mom fail.

132
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,180
- [Jeremy] This is gross.

133
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:10,020
Lise's first drink, she
was like, it's pretty good.

134
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,163
Get some water.

135
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,240
- [Caleb] Can I pour it out?

136
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,110
- [Jeremy] Sure.

137
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,908
- They did something to the water.

138
00:05:15,908 --> 00:05:17,006
(running water)

139
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:19,067
(funky music)

140
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,562
- What happened?
- What?

141
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:21,459
- What?

142
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,126
How did you do that?

143
00:05:24,302 --> 00:05:26,300
(running water)

144
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,840
- What happened?

145
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,673
- Caleb's is regular.

146
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,460
- [Jeremy] How does it taste, is it gross?

147
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,473
- No, it's just water.
- It tastes like water.

148
00:05:33,473 --> 00:05:35,205
- [Jeremy] April Fools!

149
00:05:35,205 --> 00:05:37,417
(Jeremy laughs)

150
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,375
Do you guys want me to show you again?

151
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,208
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

152
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,750
- [Jeremy] We just took food coloring gel

153
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,823
and put it up there.

154
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,058
(laughing)

155
00:05:46,058 --> 00:05:48,308
(babbling)

156
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:51,340
- Toothpaste!

157
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,700
- Toothpaste.
- Right here.

158
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,921
- Toothpaste.

159
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,341
(spitting)

160
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:58,244
- [Jeremy] Mom, they're super good.

161
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:00,077
- [All] One two three.

162
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,459
(laughing)

163
00:06:09,025 --> 00:06:10,819
- You guys got me!

164
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,034
You got me.

165
00:06:12,034 --> 00:06:12,867
- It's a--

166
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:13,776
(splash)

167
00:06:13,776 --> 00:06:15,668
(screaming)

168
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:18,618
(laughing)

169
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:20,510
- You got a little wet buddy.

170
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,640
So with the kids getting older and wiser,

171
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,090
it's getting harder and
harder to prank them.

172
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,130
But I think this next one

173
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,200
is gonna get 'em.

174
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,650
Check out what Kendra bought.

175
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,368
We're gonna have fun with these.

176
00:06:33,368 --> 00:06:34,420
- Alright, so I know we've been having

177
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,400
a lot of discussions about
iPads and technology use,

178
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,830
and your dad and I have been
really thinking about it.

179
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,340
And we decided that for today

180
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,010
we're going to give you unlimited use

181
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,939
of the eye pad.

182
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:49,832
(cheering)

183
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:51,500
Oh shhh, Janae's sleeping.

184
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,170
So we actually got a new
eye pad for each of you

185
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:59,180
and you guys can use it as
much as you want all day.

186
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,100
So what do you guys think of that plan?

187
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,860
- It's so awesome.
- I'm really excited.

188
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,660
- But would it be only for today?

189
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,100
- [Kendra] Well, I mean
you can use it tomorrow too

190
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,933
if you want to.

191
00:07:08,544 --> 00:07:10,310
- Forever let's use it!

192
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,143
- [Kendra] Forever?

193
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:14,010
- I'm gonna do lots of
iPad time, can I Daddy?

194
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,910
- You can sleep with it at night.

195
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:19,621
This eye pad, as much as you
want to, it's yours to have.

196
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:24,621
- Here are your new eye
pads for each of you.

197
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:27,195
- Oh it's a pad for the eye.

198
00:07:27,195 --> 00:07:32,195
- [Jeremy] An eye pad for
you, an eye pad for you,

199
00:07:32,798 --> 00:07:33,673
an eye pad for you.

200
00:07:33,673 --> 00:07:34,506
(Kendra laughs)

201
00:07:34,506 --> 00:07:38,850
You can use them as much as
you want all day, every day.

202
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,693
- It's an eye pad.

203
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,581
- [Kendra] It's an eye pad.

204
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:44,624
- I can use this.

205
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,457
- I can't open it.

206
00:07:45,457 --> 00:07:47,783
- [Jeremy] Have fun with your eye pad.

207
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:49,540
- [Kendra] April Fools!

208
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,190
You can use it as much as you want today.

209
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,240
Alright, do you guys want
some real iPad time now?

210
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,330
- [All] Yeah.

211
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,170
- [Kendra] Let's do it.

212
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,886
- Oh my gosh, there's even pickles in it.

213
00:07:59,886 --> 00:08:01,372
- Yeah.

214
00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:02,872
- Is this a prank?

215
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,150
- [Jeremy] Those are chicken nuggets

216
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,393
from McDonald's look.

217
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,440
McDonald's put a pickle
in your chicken nugget?

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,360
So there's a restaurant you guys

219
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,420
that makes fried pickles.

220
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,650
And we thought we would
prank you for April Fools.

221
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:22,607
- April Fools!
- April Fools!

222
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:25,240
- Okay so it's a new recipe,

223
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,584
so I'm gonna want you guys
to all try it together.

224
00:08:27,584 --> 00:08:29,804
- I can't eat it.

225
00:08:29,804 --> 00:08:32,340
(playful music)

226
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,909
- It's foam.

227
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,299
- It's a bread!

228
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,789
- [Jeremy] Kendra cut up these sponges

229
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,900
and then put chocolate frosting on them.

230
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,349
- [Caleb] Thank you
Mom for giving us foam.

231
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,184
- [Kendra] It's real chocolate frosting.

- Good trick, this is Jell-O.

245
00:09:24,427 --> 00:09:25,260
- What?

246
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,570
Alright, so I made this
special cake for tonight

247
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:28,950
I'm really excited about it.

248
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,650
It's a new recipe.

249
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,808
- Alright, here we go.

250
00:09:32,808 --> 00:09:34,450
(pop)

251
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,011
(slow mo pop)

252
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,450
- It's a--

253
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,414
- [Kendra] What do you think it is?

254
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,620
- Like a balloon.

255
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,453
- [Kendra] What?

256
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,770
Oh they're still going at it.

257
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,450
- [Jeremy] Everyone get some smoothie.

258
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,953
Okay on three, one two three.

259
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,743
- Tastes normal.

260
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,974
- [Jeremy] Guess what we did to it?

261
00:09:55,974 --> 00:09:57,060
- What?
- Nothing.

262
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,893
- Try to guess,

263
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:59,840
guess what we actually did to it.

264
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,750
- [Isaac] You added ice?

265
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,971
- [Jeremy] We put a little
bit of dog poo in it.

266
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:06,412
- In real life?
- Dog poo?

267
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:07,650
- [Jeremy] Just a little bit (laughs).

268
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,763
- In real life?

269
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,010
- [Jeremy] No, not at
all, I'm just kidding.

270
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,828
It's a normal smoothie.

271
00:10:14,828 --> 00:10:16,144
- Good.

272
00:10:16,144 --> 00:10:17,700
- I think they're trying to prank me.

273
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,210
It's not obvious at all.

274
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,540
- [Kendra] They asked Jeremy
to carry this large bowl

275
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:25,130
of water outside to the swing,

276
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,760
so they could feed the worms.

277
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,679
- Very thirsty worms out there.

278
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,669
(playful music)

279
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:31,508
- Right here.

280
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:34,232
- Yeah, we're gonna push you.

281
00:10:34,232 --> 00:10:35,107
Hold on.

282
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:37,446
(Kendra laughing)

283
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:38,279
- Ah!

284
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,986
It's so cold!

285
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:42,800
(laughing)

286
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,450
Okay for this next prank,

287
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,230
I'm gonna have Isaac
and Elise help me out.

288
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:48,804
We picked up some pizza for dinner.

289
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:50,880
Do you remember what we did to you guys

290
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,713
a couple of years ago,

291
00:10:51,713 --> 00:10:52,546
where, we--

292
00:10:52,546 --> 00:10:53,379
was it donuts?
- With the donuts?

293
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:54,212
- [Jeremy] Yeah, with the donuts.

294
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:55,390
Do you remember what it was?
- Broccoli in it.

295
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,020
- [Jeremy] Yeah, we're gonna
do that to Laura and Caleb.

296
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,690
I'm gonna take out one of these pizzas

297
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,030
and put in just a bunch
of carrots and vegetables

298
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,010
and we'll put the camera in there

299
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,900
and then we open it, it's like what?

300
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,050
Okay, help me out.

301
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:08,258
(lively playful music)

302
00:11:08,258 --> 00:11:11,341
- [Elise] Well we put it in the oven.

303
00:11:14,112 --> 00:11:16,817
- [Jeremy] Any carrots and
vegetables, grab 'em up.

304
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:17,650
And carrots.
- And this.

305
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,085
- [Jeremy] Yeah here, this one.

306
00:11:20,085 --> 00:11:21,335
- Use this one.

307
00:11:25,707 --> 00:11:28,374
- [Jeremy] Do a couple of these.

308
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,190
Okay, so we'll just set these up.

309
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,575
Go get 'em, go get 'em.

310
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,140
- Time for dinner.

311
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,609
- [Jeremy] Dinner's ready.

312
00:11:40,609 --> 00:11:41,859
Dinner's ready.

313
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:43,640
- Dinner!

314
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,473
- [Jeremy] Go ahead and grab your pizza

315
00:11:44,473 --> 00:11:45,780
and then we'll say a prayer.

316
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:53,525
- [All] April Fools!

317
00:11:55,087 --> 00:11:56,170
- April Fool.

318
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,123
- They don't even care,

319
00:11:58,123 --> 00:11:59,820
they're like, we just want pizza.

320
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,970
Not every prank went
exactly as we had planned,

321
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,727
but we had fun today.

322
00:12:03,727 --> 00:12:04,560
- [Kendra] What?

323
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,960
What did you think Laura?

324
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,817
- I liked it, I liked it.
- You like celery and carrots.

325
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:10,170
- Did the store do it or you?

326
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,003
- [Jeremy] We did it.

327
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:12,500
- Tricky tricky, does that mean

328
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,410
here's another pizza somewhere?

329
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,243
- [Elise] Yeah.

330
00:12:14,243 --> 00:12:16,166
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it's in the oven.

331
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,818
- Awesome.

332
00:12:17,818 --> 00:12:19,608
Goodnight, J House out.

333
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,526
(Jeremy gasps)

334
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:21,868
- [Jeremy] Oh no.

335
00:12:21,868 --> 00:12:23,036
- Uh-oh

336
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:24,824
(playful music)

337
00:12:24,824 --> 00:12:25,657
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

338
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,413
Brown, gray and yellow.

339
00:12:32,453 --> 00:00:00,000
- I got pink, my favorite color.
