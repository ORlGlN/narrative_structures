1
00:00:00,637 --> 00:00:02,637
- [Kendra] What did you find Janae?

2
00:00:02,637 --> 00:00:04,853
- Ha ha ha ha.
(clapping)

3
00:00:04,853 --> 00:00:07,436
(bright music)

4
00:00:12,378 --> 00:00:14,628
(cheering)

5
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:20,043
- [Kendra] Cubby, what's ya makin'?

6
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:23,243
- I'm trying to make
like a secret passageway.

7
00:00:23,243 --> 00:00:24,899
- [Kendra] That's pretty cool.

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,643
Oh did you make a train track?

9
00:00:26,643 --> 00:00:28,459
- I made this one.

10
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:31,959
I made seven eight nine 10, 11, 12 14, 15.

11
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,372
(clattering)

12
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:36,205
- Stop!

13
00:00:36,205 --> 00:00:37,474
- [Kendra] Oh no.

14
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:39,340
Nae Nae did you get it?

15
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,708
She just wants to play you guys.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,716
- Yeah, we can put it back.

17
00:00:43,716 --> 00:00:45,376
- I guess that's a baby play.

18
00:00:45,376 --> 00:00:46,488
- [Kendra] It is.

19
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,055
- Destroy.

20
00:00:48,055 --> 00:00:49,394
- [Kendra] So the kids are
ready to build a new one,

21
00:00:49,394 --> 00:00:52,197
so letting Janae knock it over.

22
00:00:52,197 --> 00:00:54,996
And of course, now she's not interested.

23
00:00:54,996 --> 00:00:57,538
(clattering)

24
00:00:57,538 --> 00:00:58,374
(laughing)

25
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,541
She's like, what was that?

26
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:04,304
(squealing)

27
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:10,729
- Got you.

28
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:12,969
I got you.

29
00:01:22,493 --> 00:01:24,918
- [Jeremy] Good job Elise.

30
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,510
Elise, you're doing awesome.

31
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,633
What game are you playing?

32
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:28,466
- Infection.

33
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:29,360
- [Jeremy] Infection?

34
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,535
- [Elise] And I just got tagged.

35
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:31,400
- [Jeremy] Alright.

36
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,689
- Now Elise is it.

37
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:35,057
Count to five with your eyes closed.

38
00:01:35,057 --> 00:01:37,224
- One two three four five.

39
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:39,736
- [Jeremy] Laura, you're it with Elise.

40
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:41,168
Go get the boys.

41
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,951
- I'm gonna go this way.

42
00:01:42,951 --> 00:01:44,511
- [Jeremy] Get 'em.

43
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,178
(uptempo suspenseful music)

44
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:54,454
(yelling)

45
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,922
Oh got him in the face (laughs).

46
00:01:56,922 --> 00:01:59,243
Okay, now all of you guys
have to go get Isaac.

47
00:01:59,243 --> 00:02:00,522
Laura get him!

48
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:01,355
Get Isaac!

49
00:02:04,212 --> 00:02:05,462
Oh, he got you.

50
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:08,907
Okay, Isaac's it.

51
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,408
(sweet music)

52
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:15,012
- [Kendra] What do you think of that, huh?

53
00:02:15,012 --> 00:02:17,413
What did you find Janae?

54
00:02:17,413 --> 00:02:18,913
What did you find?

55
00:02:20,676 --> 00:02:21,620
We just read this book.

56
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,868
It's called If It Rains Pancakes.

57
00:02:23,868 --> 00:02:24,708
It was so good.

58
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,125
So it was about haiku and lantern poems

59
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,844
and so the kids are now

60
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:31,516
going to compose their own haiku poems.

61
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:34,004
Okay, how many syllables do you need?

62
00:02:34,004 --> 00:02:36,468
- Five on the top, seven in the middle,

63
00:02:36,468 --> 00:02:38,020
five on the top.

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,613
- [Kendra] You mean five on the bottom.

65
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:42,140
Alright, what are you gonna
write your haiku poem about?

66
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,604
- Sports probably.

67
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:44,893
- [Kendra] What are you
gonna write yours about?

68
00:02:44,893 --> 00:02:46,701
- I have no idea.

69
00:02:46,701 --> 00:02:48,034
- Football time.

70
00:02:49,357 --> 00:02:51,787
Football time
(clapping)

71
00:02:51,787 --> 00:02:52,620
is fun.

72
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:55,040
That's five.

73
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,925
- [Kendra] That is five.

74
00:02:56,925 --> 00:02:58,638
- Now I need seven.

75
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,931
- [Kendra] Okay Isaac, let's hear it.

76
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:04,546
- Inflatable dinos for Isaac on Halloween.

77
00:03:04,546 --> 00:03:06,657
They seriously are.

78
00:03:06,657 --> 00:03:08,740
- So Especially Fana see.

79
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,677
- [Kendra] That's amazing, good job.

80
00:03:12,677 --> 00:03:14,927
- Football, ha ha ha ha ha.

81
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,629
(Kendra laughing)

82
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:21,870
- So I almost didn't ask Caleb

83
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,750
to write a haiku,

84
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,519
because I'm like, he's in kindergarten.

85
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,886
He totally nailed this, I am so impressed.

86
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:28,502
Let's hear it dude.

87
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:30,766
- Football time is fun,

88
00:03:30,766 --> 00:03:32,899
especially Fana,

89
00:03:32,899 --> 00:03:34,982
see football ha ha ha ha.

90
00:03:37,972 --> 00:03:40,896
(Kendra laughing)

91
00:03:40,896 --> 00:03:43,834
- [Kendra] I love it, that is so clever.

92
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,545
- When I have fun, it makes me scream.

93
00:03:46,545 --> 00:03:47,946
- [Kendra] That's a great intro.

94
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,039
- Isaac is awesome.

95
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,527
No, he's super awesome.

96
00:03:50,527 --> 00:03:53,025
Oops, need to add words.

97
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,096
(Kendra laughs)

98
00:03:54,096 --> 00:03:54,929
- I love you Mom.

99
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:55,767
You're so silly.

100
00:03:55,767 --> 00:03:58,192
And I love you so much,

101
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:00,760
I love my whole family.

102
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,896
Even I love Janae.

103
00:04:02,896 --> 00:04:05,057
- [Kendra] Yay, that's a great poem.

104
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,365
So since I was asking the kids

105
00:04:06,365 --> 00:04:07,597
to try writing haiku poems today,

106
00:04:07,597 --> 00:04:08,855
I figured I better try it,

107
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,071
and it's actually harder than it looks.

108
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,494
So here's my challenge for you today.

109
00:04:11,494 --> 00:04:14,822
I would love for you to
write us a haiku poem

110
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:16,262
in the comments below.

111
00:04:16,262 --> 00:04:18,616
Go for it, give it a
try, it'll be awesome.

112
00:04:18,617 --> 00:04:21,017
Alright, here is my haiku poem.

113
00:04:21,017 --> 00:04:22,273
Autumn.

114
00:04:22,273 --> 00:04:24,241
Sunshine rays outside.

115
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:26,041
Warms up my heart inside,

116
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,843
like hot apple cider.

117
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,089
We've always been big fans of the library.

118
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:30,961
Elise is having tutoring sessions

119
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,433
for her dyslexia twice
a week at the library,

120
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,109
so now I feel like we kind
of live at the library,

121
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,221
which is not a bad thing.

122
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:40,304
(chill guitar music)

123
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,432
- Almost at chapter two.

124
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,487
- You have to tap 'em.

125
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,404
- [Kendra] Oh is it a touch screen?

126
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:53,698
- The dinosaur

127
00:04:57,594 --> 00:04:59,261
- [Kendra] Hey girl.

128
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:05,555
So I just dropped the camera

129
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,411
as we were loading
everything into the van.

130
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,244
I hope it still works.

131
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:10,090
I can't really tell,
because it's so bright out.

132
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,771
We've had this camera for a long time,

133
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,549
especially for how much we use it.

134
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,122
I think it's almost time for a new camera.

135
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:16,883
It's been dropped so many times.

136
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,258
So when we were at the
parade the other day,

137
00:05:18,258 --> 00:05:20,010
we got a bunch of flyers and coupons

138
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,050
for different businesses,

139
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,763
and one of them was this coupon

140
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:25,610
and it is a coupon for a free cookie

141
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,850
from this cookie store,

142
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,114
and I am not one to let a coupon

143
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,330
for a free cookie go to waste.

144
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,163
I will use it.

145
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:33,129
Do you guys want to go get a cookie?

146
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:34,233
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

147
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:35,650
- [Kendra] Oh oh,

148
00:05:38,377 --> 00:05:40,566
can you help me out buddy?

149
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:41,755
Let me see.

150
00:05:41,755 --> 00:05:44,601
Oh my goodness, these
all look so delicious.

151
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:47,243
(bright clapping music)

152
00:05:47,243 --> 00:05:48,509
- A lemon, same as Isaac.

153
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:49,620
- [Kendra] Are you gonna do a lemon?

154
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,453
- Uh-huh.

155
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:51,681
- [Kendra] Okay.

156
00:05:51,681 --> 00:05:53,045
Laura, what do you think?

157
00:05:53,045 --> 00:05:55,388
- It's good, I love it.

158
00:05:55,388 --> 00:05:56,221
- [Kendra] It's good?

159
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,054
Yum.

160
00:05:57,054 --> 00:05:58,475
how do you like lemon?

161
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,586
- It's really good.

162
00:05:59,586 --> 00:06:00,919
- [Kendra] Yeah?

163
00:06:02,742 --> 00:06:06,296
So we're sitting here admiring
all of these cookie designs

164
00:06:06,296 --> 00:06:07,607
and talking about which ones we would want

165
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,215
for our birthdays.

166
00:06:09,215 --> 00:06:10,965
Elise wants this one.

167
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:14,647
The boys both like the soccer ball.

168
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,839
I'm a big fan of this one.

169
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,805
- [Caleb] What do you
think Dad would like?

170
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:20,093
- [Kendra] What do you
think Dad would choose?

171
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:23,150
- I think he'll like, happy birthday Dego.

172
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,538
- [Kendra] Diego?

173
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:27,418
Well we could change it so
it said happy birthday Dad.

174
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:28,850
- Yeah.

175
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,433
(bright music)

176
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:35,986
- Alright poll question,
which one of these cookies

177
00:06:35,986 --> 00:06:38,231
would you choose as
decorated for your birthday.

178
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,848
So this is Janae's current favorite toy.

179
00:06:40,848 --> 00:06:44,360
She likes to shut all of the little doors

180
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,073
and then we take turns going
around and opening them.

181
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,503
(laughing)

182
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:52,735
I started filming and Caleb leans over

183
00:06:52,735 --> 00:06:55,227
and he whispers to me,
Mommy, you're not recording.

184
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:56,265
And he was totally right.

185
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,212
The camera was on, but I
had not pressed record.

186
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:00,715
So anyway, Cubby came up to me

187
00:07:00,715 --> 00:07:02,777
and asked me to play
some card games with him,

188
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:04,684
so we played our favorite math game,

189
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,055
which is addition to 10.

190
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:08,568
And then we played speed, which

191
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:10,052
- She crushed me.

192
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:12,556
- I did, unfortunately it's
my absolute favorite game.

193
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:15,124
Now what do you want us to play?

194
00:07:15,124 --> 00:07:15,963
- War.

195
00:07:15,963 --> 00:07:17,477
- War.

196
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:19,077
So we'll see.
- And now we can play chess.

197
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:19,984
- And checkers.

198
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:20,817
- You want to play chess and checkers?

199
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:22,562
Is this a game day?

200
00:07:22,562 --> 00:07:23,395
- Yeah!

201
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,930
- I guess so.

202
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,178
- So Chiefs' stadium has the world record

203
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,210
as the loudest stadium in the world.

204
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:31,364
And it gets loud there.

205
00:07:31,364 --> 00:07:34,314
(crowd roaring)

206
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:36,481
(beating)

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,749
In the news, we hear
about so many tragedies

208
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:44,043
and terrible things going on,

209
00:07:44,043 --> 00:07:47,985
with earthquakes, natural
disasters, shootings.

210
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:49,311
What I love about sports is that

211
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,015
it can bring a whole community
together to be united,

212
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:54,383
chant together, to sing together,

213
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:55,702
to have fun together.

214
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:57,535
We were clapping hands and celebrating

215
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,074
with complete strangers.

216
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:01,114
It's a really beautiful thing.

217
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:03,151
- They're on the half yard line.

218
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,236
- [Jeremy] We're about to score.

219
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,069
- Yep.

220
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,703
(funky beat music)

221
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,612
(cheering)

222
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,553
If we make this field goal,

223
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:23,886
we win the game.

224
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,450
(cheering)

225
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,352
(dramatic music)

226
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:32,185
yeah!

227
00:08:34,057 --> 00:08:34,890
Woo!

228
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:36,645
Yeah!

229
00:08:36,645 --> 00:08:37,615
- [Isaac] Good night, J House out.

230
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,346
- [Jeremy] How should
we take the fire sticks?

231
00:08:40,346 --> 00:08:42,674
- Maybe I should hold them on the drive?

232
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:44,568
- [Kendra] Are you cheering
for the other team?

233
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:45,401
Uh-oh.

234
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,940
- [Jeremy] Hey.

235
00:08:49,983 --> 00:08:53,053
(laughing)

236
00:08:53,053 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh, they scored!
