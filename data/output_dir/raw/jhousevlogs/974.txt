1
00:00:00,316 --> 00:00:02,517
- We are starting to feel better.

2
00:00:02,517 --> 00:00:03,432
Yay!

3
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:07,667
We are returning to the world of humanity.

4
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:11,834
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)

5
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:17,216
- [Mom] Here's the kids.

6
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:19,151
They are playing.

7
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:22,180
They're not just like
zombies in front of a TV

8
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,122
that are sick.

9
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:26,122
(slow violin music)

10
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:56,027
- So it's a sad story, but
we're returning the MacBook.

11
00:00:56,027 --> 00:00:57,730
We had a problem with our van

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,951
that cost about as much as a MacBook did

13
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:02,328
that we just had to get fixed yesterday.

14
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:04,558
So Kendra and I decided
we would just return this,

15
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:06,602
keep working with what we had working

16
00:01:06,602 --> 00:01:08,738
and maybe later, get this

17
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:11,767
when it makes a little
more sense, financially.

18
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,926
- For the past two days, I
haven't let these two touch

19
00:01:13,926 --> 00:01:15,436
and that's a big change for them.

20
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:16,850
They usually play a lot together,

21
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,376
so I think she's happy
to see her sister again.

22
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:23,308
- Our city that we live in
helps out different families

23
00:01:23,308 --> 00:01:24,886
during Christmas, with giving food

24
00:01:24,886 --> 00:01:27,908
and our work adopted a
couple of these families

25
00:01:27,908 --> 00:01:29,562
to buy gifts for.

26
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:32,014
Isaac is helping me out with delivering.

27
00:01:32,014 --> 00:01:33,578
Alright, here you go.

28
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:37,688
So it's warm enough to just
be hanging out outside.

29
00:01:37,688 --> 00:01:39,887
We're looking up at the trees.

30
00:01:39,887 --> 00:01:42,085
You can hear tons of birds out here.

31
00:01:42,085 --> 00:01:44,085
We have squirrels all
over out in our backyard.

32
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:44,918
- And bunnies.

33
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:46,074
- And bunnies?

34
00:01:46,074 --> 00:01:50,129
- And sometimes we have
white-tailed deer and coyotes.

35
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:51,296
- That's true.

36
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,676
So, we're just enjoying being out here.

37
00:01:55,676 --> 00:01:57,086
You know, I feel like
we've been cooped up,

38
00:01:57,086 --> 00:02:00,162
with everybody else being sick inside.

39
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:03,301
It feels so nice to be outside
and smell the air out here.

40
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,331
I spend so much of my day
just going from the house

41
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:10,451
into the garage, into my
office at work, back home

42
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:12,657
and never have any time outside.

43
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,544
That's a really hard
thing about the winter.

44
00:02:14,544 --> 00:02:15,629
- Yeah.

45
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:17,796
(giggles)

46
00:02:21,985 --> 00:02:23,318
- Love you, bud.

47
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:25,249
You wanna go play some more?

48
00:02:25,249 --> 00:02:26,314
- Yeah!

49
00:02:26,314 --> 00:02:27,894
- We're gonna go play some wallball.

50
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,598
- Okay, someone is
definitely feeling better.

51
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,171
I can tell because her
sense of style is back.

52
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,797
Come show us your outfit, sweet girl.

53
00:02:35,797 --> 00:02:37,219
Alright.

54
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:39,663
- And I'm gonna do
exercise and wash my hands

55
00:02:39,663 --> 00:02:41,895
and eat fruits and vegetables.

56
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,293
- [Kendra] Why are you gonna do all that?

57
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:46,043
- So I can feel much much better.

58
00:02:50,206 --> 00:02:51,232
- Good catch.

59
00:02:51,232 --> 00:02:53,567
That's another point.

60
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:57,859
If he gets three points, he
has to stand up here, like this

61
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,805
and I get to throw it right at him.

62
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,368
- [Kendra] This looks like
a game you would've played

63
00:03:01,368 --> 00:03:03,356
evily with your brothers growing up.

64
00:03:03,356 --> 00:03:06,147
- Oh, I got a lot of welts
playing with my brothers

65
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:07,224
growing up.

66
00:03:07,224 --> 00:03:08,069
- [Kendra] Uh oh.

67
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:09,501
- So I got three points, so he gets

68
00:03:09,501 --> 00:03:10,334
(ball thuds)

69
00:03:10,334 --> 00:03:11,856
Hey, wait, wait!

70
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:12,836
I wasn't ready.

71
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,586
I gotta brace myself.

72
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,013
- [Isaac] Is it time?

73
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,430
- Yeah, go ahead.

74
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,196
(grunts)

75
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:24,718
- [Kendra] What do you find out there?

76
00:03:24,718 --> 00:03:26,285
What do you see, huh?

77
00:03:26,285 --> 00:03:28,035
She's watching da-da.

78
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,650
(ball thuds)

79
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:39,870
No wonder she likes this spot, huh?

80
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,627
We are making a Christmas treat.

81
00:03:41,627 --> 00:03:43,034
I bought these ingredients a few days ago

82
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:44,954
and I've been dying to make it.

83
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:47,942
It is called Ooey Gooey Chex
Mix or Christmas Happiness

84
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:49,282
or Christmas Crack.

85
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,696
Those are all the names for it.

86
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,016
My sister, Tiffany, has been making it

87
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,151
forever with her family

88
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:55,096
and we're not gonna see them
this year for Christmas,

89
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:58,681
so I wanted to learn
how to make it myself.

90
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:00,938
In this bowl, we have six cups of,

91
00:04:00,938 --> 00:04:02,772
the Rice Chex is at the bottom,

92
00:04:02,772 --> 00:04:05,253
and then six cups of Golden Grahams.

93
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:09,157
Now we're adding two cups of coconut.

94
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:12,695
And two cups of slivered almonds.

95
00:04:12,695 --> 00:04:16,862
In this container, we are
going to put one cup of sugar.

96
00:04:18,464 --> 00:04:20,631
This is called corn syrup.

97
00:04:22,106 --> 00:04:24,439
- [All Kids] Oo, corn syrup.

98
00:04:25,414 --> 00:04:27,747
- I love that kind of syrup.

99
00:04:30,883 --> 00:04:31,716
- So it's boiling.

100
00:04:31,716 --> 00:04:36,108
We're going to set the
timer for two minutes.

101
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:39,691
[All Children] Five,
four, three, two, one!

102
00:04:40,769 --> 00:04:41,805
- [Dad] Alright, it's cooled down.

103
00:04:41,805 --> 00:04:42,901
- Happy New Year.

104
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,386
- [Son] Yay!

105
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:45,998
- Gooey, gooey.

106
00:04:45,998 --> 00:04:46,994
- [Daughter] So gooey.

107
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,994
- Gooey, gooey. Gooey, gooey. Gooey!

108
00:04:52,477 --> 00:04:54,753
- [Daughter] It's like, I
wanna eat it. I wanna eat it.

109
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,836
- [Isaac] No!

110
00:04:56,961 --> 00:04:57,803
- How long is it?

111
00:04:57,803 --> 00:04:59,271
- Ah ha.

112
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:00,726
- Okay, so the ooey gooey Chex Mix

113
00:05:00,726 --> 00:05:02,404
has to cool down for a second.

114
00:05:02,404 --> 00:05:05,213
And while it's cooling, we
heard about something fun

115
00:05:05,213 --> 00:05:08,356
from our friends, the
Canadian family vlog.

116
00:05:08,356 --> 00:05:10,292
- I think it's called the Cupboard Vortex.

117
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:12,729
- Oh, yes. The mysterious Cupboard Vortex.

118
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,017
So apparently, we take our camera

119
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:17,900
and we put it in a cupboard
and you guys are like magically

120
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,010
- [Husband] Transported.

121
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,684
- Transported to somewhere else.

122
00:05:20,684 --> 00:05:22,071
So we're gonna give it a try.

123
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:22,904
Safe travels.

124
00:05:22,904 --> 00:05:23,737
Bye.

125
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:26,889
- Hey, it totally worked!

126
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:27,938
Guys, check it out.

127
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:28,788
- Hi.

128
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:30,255
- [Man] We're on the J house vlogs.

129
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:31,538
I'm Nick.

130
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:32,859
- I'm Vicky.

131
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:33,692
- Aboni.

132
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:35,894
- Malachi.

133
00:05:35,894 --> 00:05:37,615
- [Nick] And this is Levi.

134
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:39,206
Hi.

135
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,790
And we're the Canadian Family Vlog,

136
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,418
so basically we do daily videos
just like the J House Vlogs,

137
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:45,865
except we're in Canada.

138
00:05:45,865 --> 00:05:48,422
Right now it's snowing so
much, we have a snow day.

139
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,467
So we're having lots of fun.

140
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:50,625
- Yay!

141
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,532
- And I get a day off of

142
00:05:51,532 --> 00:05:52,865
- Yeah, that's true.

143
00:05:52,865 --> 00:05:54,476
Yay!

144
00:05:54,476 --> 00:05:56,456

with our family every single day.

148

- [Vicky] Our three crazy kids!

149
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,838
- And we're good friends

So, we're gonna put you back,
so we'll see you guys later.

156
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:18,849
- [All] Bye!

157
00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:21,689
- Bye. See you later.

158
00:06:22,665 --> 00:06:24,415
Tell them we said hi.

159
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:27,804
- Hi guys.

160
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,664
Are you back?

161
00:06:28,664 --> 00:06:29,658
- [Husband] We love the
Canadian Family Vlog.

162
00:06:29,658 --> 00:06:31,201
- How was Canada?

163
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,366
- Well, our food here has cooled down,

164
00:06:32,366 --> 00:06:34,754
so the kids are anxious to try our treat.

165
00:06:34,754 --> 00:06:36,407
- [Kendra] Here they are.

166
00:06:36,407 --> 00:06:39,906
- [Younger Brother]
What song is it called?

167
00:06:39,906 --> 00:06:41,989
- [Isaac] "Silent Night".

168
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,277
(singing) Silent night, holy night.

169
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:51,771
All!

170
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,357
- Joy to

171
00:06:55,357 --> 00:06:57,134
- I'm not ready.

172
00:06:57,134 --> 00:06:58,325
There it is.

173
00:06:58,325 --> 00:06:59,825
- Joy to the world

174
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,355
(babbles)

175
00:07:08,330 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
