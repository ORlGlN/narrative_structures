1
00:00:00,395 --> 00:00:02,036
- Well, we love our rental
house but we are having

2
00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:03,408
one issue with it.

3
00:00:03,408 --> 00:00:07,075
- So, we're at a museum
with the Ballingers.

4
00:00:08,536 --> 00:00:10,147
(child babbling)

5
00:00:10,147 --> 00:00:12,730
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:20,026 --> 00:00:21,779
- [Mom] Good morning.

7
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,783
- [Children] Good morning.

8
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:25,022
- [Mom] What's the weather
like today, Ms. Laura?

9
00:00:25,022 --> 00:00:26,201
- Cold.

10
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:27,542
It's raining outside right now.

11
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:29,130
- [Mom] Where were we going to go today?

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,091
- The zoo.

13
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,741
It's world famous.

14
00:00:31,741 --> 00:00:32,643
- [Mom] It is world famous.

15
00:00:32,643 --> 00:00:34,627
We'll have to go another
day, maybe tomorrow.

16
00:00:34,627 --> 00:00:36,341
School time.

17
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:38,592
Macy's working on a math test.

18
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:39,981
- It's hard.

19
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:42,545
- Isaac is working on spelling dictation.

20
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:45,285
We are having quite the
rain and windstorm today.

21
00:00:45,285 --> 00:00:47,098
It's calm at the moment but
this morning, early morning,

22
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:49,348
it was crazy out there.

23
00:00:49,348 --> 00:00:51,980
It woke all us up, like
the sound of the wind.

24
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,686
Anyway, on a positive
note, that means it's only

25
00:00:54,686 --> 00:00:57,030
like 7:30 and we're all
dressed and ready for the day

26
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,328
and doing our school work and
already have eaten breakfast.

27
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:02,495
- I am making a person that is edible.

28
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,415
- Oh, that can make me pretty!

29
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,101
- [Mom] What are you making?

30
00:01:10,101 --> 00:01:11,934
- Some relish bakeoff?

31
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,974
- Time's up.

32
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:16,891
- So I made this thing.

33
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:19,912
- [Mom] What is it?

34
00:01:19,912 --> 00:01:21,231
- It's the ocean.

35
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,884
- Well we love our rental
house, but we are having

36
00:01:22,884 --> 00:01:25,084
one issue with it and that is the stove.

37
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:28,822
It is really not working very well.

38
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,239
It's not heating things up.

39
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,009
It kind of warms things but
it doesn't get really hot,

40
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,491
which is kinda the purpose of a stove.

41
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,569
So we ended up contacting
the people that we're

42
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,284
renting from and they were amazing.

43
00:01:38,284 --> 00:01:40,587
They got right back to
us and they apologized

44
00:01:40,587 --> 00:01:41,610
for the inconvenience.

45
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:42,810
We're like, "It's not a big deal,"

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,167
but they're sending a technician out

47
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:45,552
to look at it this morning.

48
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:47,333
So, hopefully that'll get
fixed because we do plan on

49
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,286
cooking a lot while we stay here.

50
00:01:49,286 --> 00:01:50,780
Cleaning up the Playdoh mess?

51
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,613
- Yep.

52
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,425
- [Mom] Good job.

53
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,008
(upbeat music)

54
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:06,355
- [Dad] Looks like there
might be sun coming out.

55
00:02:06,355 --> 00:02:09,264
- The sun'll come out this afternoon.

56
00:02:09,264 --> 00:02:13,042
Bet your bottom dollar
that there'll be sun.

57
00:02:13,042 --> 00:02:15,204
- So with Kendra's beautiful song,

58
00:02:15,204 --> 00:02:18,556
our kids just signed
up for the play, Annie.

59
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,430
They're gonna be doing it this summer with

60
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,628
one of the local theaters.

61
00:02:21,628 --> 00:02:23,612
They haven't even seen it yet
but they're excited about it.

62
00:02:23,612 --> 00:02:25,533
- But you have to be six and up.

63
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:27,766
- [Dad] Yeah so, unfortunately,
Laura is just gonna

64
00:02:27,766 --> 00:02:29,263
get to watch with me!

65
00:02:29,263 --> 00:02:31,680
(soft music)

66
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:58,279
- The traffic is a little bad,

67
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,954
but not that much.

68
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:08,810
Always remembering my mom
and dad are nice, nice, nice.

69
00:03:12,186 --> 00:03:16,353
Sometimes they're angry
and sometimes they're not.

70
00:03:18,926 --> 00:03:20,843
So, I love mom and dad.

71
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:26,093
And this is my end of the song.

72
00:03:29,373 --> 00:03:31,873
(light music)

73
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,492
- No truer words were ever spoken.

74
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:40,012
Did you hear in Laura's song
that Mom and Dad are nice

75
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,272
but sometimes they are angry?

76
00:03:41,272 --> 00:03:43,017
Yeah, that's real life.

77
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,608
Real life parenting right there.

78
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,009
We are driving right now to meet up with

79
00:03:46,009 --> 00:03:46,985
the Ballinger family.

80
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:48,432
We're really excited
they came to play with us

81
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:49,932
for a couple days here in San Diego

82
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:51,394
and we love their family.

83
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:52,858
They're a home schooling family like us.

84
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,118
They've got four kids,
we've got five kids.

85
00:03:54,118 --> 00:03:56,230
Play really well together.

86
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:57,321
The parents are awesome.

87
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,393
Basically it's just really
fun to be able to see friends

88
00:03:59,393 --> 00:04:00,779
who you don't get to see very often.

89
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,164
We live in different parts of the country.

90
00:04:02,164 --> 00:04:03,663
So this is a real treat for our family.

91
00:04:03,663 --> 00:04:05,533
- I'm gonna put an iCard right here

92
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,568
to the Ballinger family
so you can check them out.

93
00:04:07,568 --> 00:04:12,154
- We're sure that you're gonna
love them just like we do.

94
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:13,821
- [Dad] The reunion.

95
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,457
(kids screaming)
(parents laughing)

96
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:19,374
- Hey Mark, how are ya?

97
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,059
Let's do it.

98
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,155
Release the minions.

99
00:04:24,155 --> 00:04:26,906
- So, we're at a museum
with the Ballingers.

100
00:04:26,906 --> 00:04:29,489
(upbeat music)

101
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:35,026
- How are they on the exact same metal?

102
00:04:41,112 --> 00:04:42,779
How does this do it?

103
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:46,042
- [Child] There's
lightning in the thunder.

104
00:04:46,042 --> 00:04:48,875
- [Dad] Thunder, feel the thunder.

105
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,409
- [Woman] Well, we have two blocks here.

106
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:53,139
- [Dad] Which one's warmer?

107
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,251
- This one's cold.

108
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,258
- This one's warm.

109
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,316
- This one's warmer.

110
00:04:57,316 --> 00:04:59,691
- [Woman] If I put ice
cubes on each of the blocks,

111
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:03,485
where do you think it's gonna melt faster?

112
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:04,318
- On here.

113
00:05:05,644 --> 00:05:07,561
- [Woman] The warm one?

114
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:13,640
- How does that one do that?

115
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,826
- [Dad] Isn't that crazy?

116
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:17,705
Why would it be melting on the cold one

117
00:05:17,705 --> 00:05:19,109
rather than the warm one?

118
00:05:19,109 --> 00:05:20,288
What do you guys think?

119
00:05:20,288 --> 00:05:21,121
- That one's metal.

120
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,107
- [Dad] What did you say?

121
00:05:22,107 --> 00:05:22,940
- Metal.

122
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,871
- [Dad] Metal?

123
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:26,331
Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!

124
00:05:26,331 --> 00:05:27,573
You are right!

125
00:05:27,573 --> 00:05:28,406
- [Woman] You are right.

126
00:05:28,406 --> 00:05:29,333
This is metal.

127
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:33,885
What affects heat transfer is
the material of the object.

128
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,468
(upbeat music)

129
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:41,069
- [Dad] It's standing all on it's own.

130
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:45,285
Duncan and Jenae.

131
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,974
The babies meet.

132
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:56,339
- We're making a Golden Gate Bridge.

133
00:05:56,339 --> 00:05:57,488
- [Dad] A bridge?

134
00:05:57,488 --> 00:06:00,071
(upbeat music)

135
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,031
The bridge is completed.

136
00:06:09,392 --> 00:06:10,225
Almost!

137
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:12,665
Rebuild.

138
00:06:24,256 --> 00:06:25,089
I love it.

139
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,887
- Kid City, five and under.

140
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:36,853
Caleb is so happy that he
is still five years old

141
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:38,537
'cause this place looks fun.

142
00:06:38,537 --> 00:06:39,620
- [Dad] Whoa.

143
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,104
- Basket, basket.

144
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:51,963
- [Dad] Look, you're bringin' em down.

145
00:06:57,882 --> 00:06:58,882
You drivin'?

146
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,417
On your mark, get set, go.

147
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,504
Best part of my day, that was amazing.

148
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,166
There you go, Elise!

149
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:28,547
- [Girl] Look at that!

150
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:32,593
- [Dad] Try it again,
try to get the spring.

151
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:34,262
- [Girl] I can't get it.

152
00:07:34,262 --> 00:07:36,120
Is there anything wrong with me?

153
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,888
Wait, is it just light reflected?

154
00:07:38,888 --> 00:07:40,686
- [Dad] Let's read what's going on here.

155
00:07:40,686 --> 00:07:41,739
- There's the spring!

156
00:07:41,739 --> 00:07:42,572
- [Dad] You found it?

157
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:43,405
- Yeah!

158
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:44,304
- [Dad] Where is it?

159
00:07:44,304 --> 00:07:45,137
- It's right here!

160
00:07:45,137 --> 00:07:45,970
- [Dad] Is it underneath?

161
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:46,803
- [Girl] Yeah, right here!

162
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:48,376
- [Dad] You're grabbing
it, you actually got it.

163
00:07:48,376 --> 00:07:52,126
- [Girl] There's the
camera that's making it.

164
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,732
- [Dad] Have you figured it out yet?

165
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:56,974
- [Boy] No.

166
00:07:56,974 --> 00:08:00,107
- [Dad] So you can
actually grab the spring.

167
00:08:00,107 --> 00:08:02,026
You can actually find it.

168
00:08:02,026 --> 00:08:04,326
- I found it, it's down here.

169
00:08:04,326 --> 00:08:05,576
I'm shaking it.

170
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:08,815
- I know there's something
to this, but this really

171
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:11,429
just looks like a spring.

172
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:12,517
- [Dad] Grab it.

173
00:08:12,517 --> 00:08:13,759
- I can't!

174
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,816
How is that?

175
00:08:14,816 --> 00:08:16,356
I mean, there's a mirror.

176
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:20,523
Look and then it makes
your hand look upside down.

177
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,287
- [Dad] Get set, go.

178
00:08:24,675 --> 00:08:25,508
Whoa!

179
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,091
- Mine is still going!

180
00:08:30,249 --> 00:08:32,655
- [Child] The blue one's coming!

181
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:35,238
(upbeat music)

182
00:08:45,123 --> 00:08:48,540
- [Dad] Alright, now push the red button.

183
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:20,887
Showing how solar power works.

184
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:26,985
Nice.

185
00:09:29,206 --> 00:09:30,039
Oh!

186
00:09:31,918 --> 00:09:33,492
He's trying to do
one-handed cartwheels 'cause

187
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:37,001
Parker can do one-handed cartwheels.

188
00:09:37,001 --> 00:09:39,501
(light music)

189
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,525
- [Kendra] Okay everybody,
look up here and smile!

190
00:09:48,525 --> 00:09:50,732
And Duncan, big smile!

191
00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:51,565
Big smile!

192
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:56,805
(kids humming song)

193
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,470
- We just made it home and
we have a brand new stove.

194
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,553
Look at this!

195
00:10:13,015 --> 00:10:16,602
It's all shiny, better keep that clean.

196
00:10:16,602 --> 00:10:17,602
- I like it!

197
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:20,132
- [Kendra] It's new.

198
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:21,549
Who's coming over?

199
00:10:21,549 --> 00:10:22,617
- The Ballingers.

200
00:10:22,617 --> 00:10:24,050
- [Kendra] What are we gonna eat?

201
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,751
- Pizza party.

202
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:26,788
- Yes!

203
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:28,050
So we're not using the stove tonight.

204
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,398
We are ordering pizza and
the Ballingers are coming

205
00:10:30,398 --> 00:10:31,451
and we're gonna hang out.

206
00:10:31,451 --> 00:10:32,949
When you have a lot of kids,
sometimes the easiest place

207
00:10:32,949 --> 00:10:34,556
to hang out is just at home.

208
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:36,112
So we considered going
to a restaurant together,

209
00:10:36,112 --> 00:10:38,030
but here, the kids can just run and play.

210
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,720
- [Dad] Laura, you playing with Duncan?

211
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,553
- Yeah.

212
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:45,402
(baby babbling)

213
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:47,152
- [Dad] Hey, what are you guys playing?

214
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:50,069
- Pass him this, it's Caleb's turn.

215
00:10:51,753 --> 00:10:54,420
(kids laughing)

216
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:56,960
- [Kendra] You guys playing Old Fellow?

217
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,131
What is this game?

218
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:00,048
- Checkers.

219
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:01,761
- Checkers.

220
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:02,628
- I'm losing.

221
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:03,573
- [Kendra] That's okay.

222
00:11:03,573 --> 00:11:04,422
Are you having fun?

223
00:11:04,422 --> 00:11:05,386
- Yep!
- Yeah.

224
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:06,567
- So we came back to our place.

225
00:11:06,567 --> 00:11:08,643
We had pizza and we have just been talking

226
00:11:08,643 --> 00:11:10,343
and hanging out and the kids
have been playing games.

227
00:11:10,343 --> 00:11:11,981
We're just chillin'.

228
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:14,991
Anyway, we have had a long
day and we've had so much fun

229
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:16,282
with the Ballingers.

230
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:17,492
- We're gonna do it again tomorrow.

231
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:20,358
- Oh yeah, we're going to
the zoo tomorrow hopefully.

232
00:11:20,358 --> 00:11:22,486
- To the zoo, zoo, zoo.

233
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:24,376
How 'bout you, you, you?

234
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:26,168
We're goin' to the zoo, zoo, zoo.

235
00:11:26,168 --> 00:11:27,585
You can come too.

236
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,013
- Once she starts singing, I'm just like,

237
00:11:30,013 --> 00:11:32,626
put it on her and see what happens.

238
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,185
And it's normally magical.

239
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:36,469
- Goodnight, Jacob's out.

240
00:11:36,469 --> 00:11:38,052
- Don't tell Mommy.

241
00:11:39,963 --> 00:11:41,831
- So I thought I'd give
you guys a quick tour.

242
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,875
Check out this view
while we're doing dishes.

243
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,686
(upbeat music)

244
00:11:46,686 --> 00:11:49,726
- [Dad] He's gonna make it.

245
00:11:49,726 --> 00:00:00,000
You lost it!
