1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:01,825
- [Jeremy] Basketball on skates.

2
00:00:01,825 --> 00:00:04,408
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,039
- We have food and we are somewhere fun

4
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,122
and it's gonna be bedtime any minute.

5
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:24,850
(soft music)

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:27,349
So today is the big day.

7
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:30,815
We are suppose to be flying to San Diego.

8
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:35,045
We've got our bags pack and
now Jenae is throwing up.

9
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:37,621
It's so sad when a little baby throws up

10
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,342
'cause they don't know what's going on.

11
00:00:39,342 --> 00:00:41,761
She just like cries.

12
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:43,302
Ugh, it's so sad.

13
00:00:43,302 --> 00:00:47,331
Anyway, we don't know what we're
going to do about our trip.

14
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:49,097
Our flight is later this afternoon

15
00:00:49,097 --> 00:00:52,595
so we still have time that if
she doesn't throw up again,

16
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,801
we might be okay because stomach bugs

17
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,803
can pass pretty quickly

18
00:00:56,803 --> 00:00:58,829
and she was throwing up in the nighttime.

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,134
Or the other option is
that Jeremy will go ahead

20
00:01:01,134 --> 00:01:03,621
with all the other kids and
Jenae and I will stay here

21
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,265
until she's healthy and then fly out.

22
00:01:06,265 --> 00:01:07,356
It's hard because we keep hoping

23
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:08,909
that she's gonna be getting better

24
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:10,563
but then she throws up again,.

25
00:01:10,563 --> 00:01:15,154
It's so hard to see your
baby in pain like that

26
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:16,041
and not feeling good.

27
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,246
The timing is terrible.

28
00:01:18,246 --> 00:01:20,249
- We're ice skating.

29
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:23,082
(orchestra music)

30
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:28,023
- [Jeremy] How's it goin'?

31
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:28,889
- Good.

32
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,273
- [Jeremy] Did you guys
build somethin' awesome?

33
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:33,190
Let's see it, stick the marbles in.

34
00:01:38,126 --> 00:01:39,746
- See, it jumps into there.

35
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,663
- [Jeremy] That's cool.

36
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,741
- Just weird with the shadows.

37
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:46,316
- [Jeremy] Shadows are kind of cool, huh.

38
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,441
- Yeah.

39
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,950
I'm in a sunny spot 'cause I'm cold.

40
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,402
- [Jeremy] Do you know what
the most important thing is

41
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,709
for some of the best
scientists in the world?

42
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,127
Observation.

43
00:01:56,127 --> 00:01:58,748
Just looking at the
world, looking at shadows,

44
00:01:58,748 --> 00:02:00,053
looking at nature.

45
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:00,886
- Really?

46
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,360
- [Jeremy] Yeah, really.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,039
I think it's so cool that
you're observing your shadow.

48
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:09,560
- I normally just look out the window.

49
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,911
- So I saw the greatest thing ever.

50
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:14,657
Naenae is acting happy.

51
00:02:14,657 --> 00:02:15,995
- She took a little nap.

52
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,458
- [Jeremy] And she ate a little bit.

53
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:19,866
- She ate a tiny bit so we're waiting

54
00:02:19,866 --> 00:02:21,182
to see if she'll keep that down

55
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,465
and then I can feed her some more.

56
00:02:22,465 --> 00:02:24,332
(baby grunting and cooing)

57
00:02:24,332 --> 00:02:25,919
She just wants to go out
and play with the kids,

58
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,280
but I'm nervous about that.

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,113
(playful piano music)

60
00:02:29,113 --> 00:02:31,150
- [Jeremy] I'm gonna get you.

61
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:34,154
I'm gonna get you, hey stinky.

62
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,071
- I think, I think this might work.

63
00:02:38,373 --> 00:02:40,071
- Hi. (kissing)

64
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:41,715
- With the long travel day
we're trying to get the kids

65
00:02:41,715 --> 00:02:44,302
get their wiggles out and use
up some energy being active

66
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,709
as much as possible.

67
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,754
So we pulled the cars out
of the garage one last time.

68
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:52,036
- We're playing basketball.

69
00:02:52,036 --> 00:02:53,634
- [Jeremy] Basketball on skates?

70
00:02:53,634 --> 00:02:54,511
- Yep.

71
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,479
- [Jeremy] Okay, let's see it.

72
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:58,146
(hip hop music)

73
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,314
Good job, Kaleb.

74
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,337
Whoa, that was (mumbling).

75
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:10,420
You guys, think of how much
better you are at skating now

76
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,254
from the first day.

77
00:03:12,254 --> 00:03:13,187
- Hey Reesey.

78
00:03:13,187 --> 00:03:14,414
- Hey what?

79
00:03:14,414 --> 00:03:15,944
- Show us how to get down.

80
00:03:15,944 --> 00:03:16,777
- No way.

81
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:18,240
- Show us how to get down.

82
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,128
- Okay.

83
00:03:19,128 --> 00:03:23,740
- D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.

84
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,907
D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.

85
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:31,335
- [Jeremy] What do you
think Nae-na-na-nae?

86
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:32,202
- Laura.

87
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:33,225
- Hey what?

88
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,106
- Show us how to get down.

89
00:03:35,106 --> 00:03:36,230
- No way.

90
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,939
- Show us how to get down.

91
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:38,772
- Okay.

92
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:43,602
- D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.

93
00:03:43,602 --> 00:03:47,927
D-O-W-N, that's the way to get down.

94
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,436
- So Elise is looking at this.

95
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,505
Is it a puzzle?

96
00:03:51,505 --> 00:03:52,338
- [Elise] Uh huh.

97
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:53,575
- [Jeremy] She's looking at this puzzle

98
00:03:53,575 --> 00:03:55,487
and she started singing this song.

99
00:03:55,487 --> 00:03:56,702

to sing this reminded me

106
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,812
of this video we have.

107
00:04:20,812 --> 00:04:24,784
We posted it, it was filmed
before we ever started Vlogging.

108
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:26,720

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,793
- [Kendra] Three years old.

117
00:04:51,793 --> 00:04:52,761
- [Jeremy] I think it was three.

118
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:53,594
- [Kendra] It was three years old.

119
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:54,427

and now we get to unload everything.

127

♪ Let's begin now ♪

128
00:05:19,223 --> 00:05:22,170
Okay, I know that looked
like a ton of luggage

129
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,314
and it was we have five ginormous bags

130
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:26,002
and we're taking three car seats

131
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,641
and it's just a lot to pack.

132
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:30,654
I'm actually feeling pretty
proud of myself about it

133
00:05:30,654 --> 00:05:32,129
because there are seven
of us in our family.

134
00:05:32,129 --> 00:05:34,164
We're gonna be gone for a full month.

135
00:05:34,164 --> 00:05:35,751
We needed all of our homeschool stuff.

136
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,001
I've got their math stuff
and their spelling stuff.

137
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:39,936
Two of the girls are having
birthdays while we're gone,

138
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:41,299
so I've got their birthday stuff.

139
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,716
There's just a lot to fit in.

140
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
We did it.

141
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:56,256
- [Jeremy] (laughing) You're last.

142
00:05:58,088 --> 00:05:58,921
Kaleb.

143
00:06:02,892 --> 00:06:05,018
I beat you guys.

144
00:06:05,018 --> 00:06:07,601
(upbeat music)

145
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:12,286
Jenae found a dog.

146
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,119
Hey.

147
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:16,078
You guys ready to get on the airplane?

148
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,828
- Yeah, we're goin' to San Diego.

149
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,257
- So I got this teething necklace.

150
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,528
She is loving it.

151
00:06:25,528 --> 00:06:26,361
- [Jeremy] It's a good idea

152
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,880
'cause we didn't want
to drop a teething toy.

153
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,589
- Yes, I like that it's attached to me

154
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:33,006
so it's not always falling on the ground.

155
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:35,811
- I declare a thumb war.

156
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,585
Five, six, seven, eight

157
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:40,502
Have to keep your fingers straight.

158
00:06:43,829 --> 00:06:46,412
(upbeat music)

159
00:07:45,448 --> 00:07:48,781
- [Kendra] You guys playing tic-tac-toe?

160
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:51,377
Are you Xs or Os?

161
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:53,110
- She's normally both.

162
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,110
- [Kendra] Really she's?

163
00:07:57,227 --> 00:08:01,394
(laughing) That was quite the yawn.

164
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:07,488
- [Jeremy] She want's
to see out the window.

165
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:19,762
(salsa music)

166
00:08:19,762 --> 00:08:22,929
This is a very busy airport right now.

167
00:08:29,865 --> 00:08:31,879
- So this is always the
hardest part of our trip.

168
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,804
It's getting the baggage and
making it to the rental car.

169
00:08:34,804 --> 00:08:37,527
Poor Jeremy is the pack mule.

170
00:08:37,527 --> 00:08:40,317
- [Jeremy] Naenae is exploring
our new rental house.

171
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,410
- I think this place is perfect.

172
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,851
- It is really adorable.

173
00:08:44,851 --> 00:08:47,360
Kendra just asked if I'm trying the wifi.

174
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,184
Anytime we go stay
somewhere for a long time

175
00:08:50,184 --> 00:08:52,242
whether or not it has good
wifi makes a big difference

176
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,065
for uploading videos.

177
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:55,381
- Well the weather here's amazing.

178
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,778
I'm in a short-sleeved
shirt and flip flops.

179
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,703
The last hour or so we spent
settling into our rental house

180
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:02,413
and I really like it.

181
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,067
It's got character.

182
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:07,284
It's layout is fun and
unique and the outdoor space.

183
00:09:07,284 --> 00:09:09,118
Oh, it's just beautiful.

184
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:11,035
Alright, let's do this.

185
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,010
(upbeat music)

186
00:09:20,133 --> 00:09:21,381
- Where's the trash?

187
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:24,521
- [Kendra] Underneath the sink, I believe.

188
00:09:24,521 --> 00:09:28,687
- So it's passed 10 pm, Kansas City time.

189
00:09:28,687 --> 00:09:30,577
Our kids are starting to melt down

190
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:32,456
but we haven't really had dinner.

191
00:09:32,456 --> 00:09:33,738
It's a crazy night.

192
00:09:33,738 --> 00:09:36,551
- But we have food and
we are somewhere fun.

193
00:09:36,551 --> 00:09:38,767
It's gonna be bedtime any minute.

194
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,398
Well the kids are finally asleep

195
00:09:40,398 --> 00:09:42,165
and I am completely exhausted,

196
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,616
but I'm so grateful to be here.

197
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:45,011
The rental house is beautiful.

198
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:46,991
I can't wait to show you guys all of it

199
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,950
when the light is out in the daytime.

200
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,929
We're just excited.

201
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,527
We're looking forward to our month

202
00:09:52,527 --> 00:09:55,339
that we get to spend here in San Diego.

203
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,614
I'm also just feeling
really, really grateful.

204
00:09:59,614 --> 00:10:02,832
This morning started out pretty rough.

205
00:10:02,832 --> 00:10:04,711
Jenae had thrown up in the night time

206
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:08,795
and then this morning she
threw up twice all over me.

207
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,888
She was just really, really miserable.

208
00:10:10,888 --> 00:10:12,710
I spent most the morning just holding her,

209
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,163
trying to comfort her
any way that I could.

210
00:10:15,163 --> 00:10:17,874
Jeremy gathered the kids
together and they prayed.

211
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:19,721
They prayed that Jenae could get better

212
00:10:19,721 --> 00:10:21,026
so we could all travel together

213
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:24,390
because the thought of
traveling with throwing up baby

214
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,874
wouldn't be fun for her or me

215
00:10:25,874 --> 00:10:27,956
or everyone else on the airplane.

216
00:10:27,956 --> 00:10:31,938
We were seriously discussing
delaying our flight.

217
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:34,600
Jeremy and I prayed for her

218
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,214
and I know my parents
were praying for her.

219
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:41,108
Sometimes it amazes me that God cares

220
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,706
about the little things.

221
00:10:43,706 --> 00:10:46,046
I'm just feeling really grateful.

222
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:48,465
- [Laura] Good night to yourself.

223
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:51,368
- The house looked like it has blown up.

224
00:10:51,368 --> 00:10:53,252
- [Jeremy] Say goodbye to Granny Joe.

225
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,322
- Move your body.

226
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,786
- I'm going to show you somethin'.

227
00:10:57,786 --> 00:11:00,723
- [Kendra] She's dancing, she's dancing.

228
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,580
- Can we tell them where we're going?

229
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,913
We're going to--

230
00:11:05,808 --> 00:00:00,000
(piano music)
