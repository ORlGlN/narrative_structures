1
00:00:00,477 --> 00:00:04,392
- [Dad] Mary, where's your baby Jesus?

2
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,059
- I need baby Laura.

3
00:00:07,288 --> 00:00:10,456
- (Laughing) Baby Laura's gonna fill in?

4
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:13,610
Apparently baby Laura
is gonna be baby Jesus.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,443
- Hey!

6
00:00:14,443 --> 00:00:16,790
- Who decided you guys were
going to do the Nativity?

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,258
- Us.

8
00:00:18,258 --> 00:00:20,185
- Who came up with the idea?

9
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,307
- Me.

10
00:00:21,307 --> 00:00:25,474
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)

11
00:00:28,386 --> 00:00:30,386
- I'm actually Joseph.

12
00:00:30,386 --> 00:00:31,377
- [Dad] Oh, you're Joseph?

13
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:32,261
- Uh huh.

14
00:00:32,261 --> 00:00:33,333
- [Dad] And you're Mary?

15
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:34,166
- Umhum.

16
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,278
- [Dad] Okay. You guys are married then.

17
00:00:36,278 --> 00:00:37,812
Go get your wife.

18
00:00:37,812 --> 00:00:38,774
Tell her you love her.

19
00:00:38,774 --> 00:00:42,941
(Christmas piano music with sleigh bells)

20
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,010
- No, we need to do the rest of it.

21
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,937
So we need to knock on
one of the stable's doors.

22
00:00:52,937 --> 00:00:54,104
With the baby!

23
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:57,164
- I'll hold the baby.

24
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:58,414
- You put it --

25
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,689
And they said no.

26
00:01:22,902 --> 00:01:24,367
- I'm the wise man.

27
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,661
- [Dad] And what are you on?

28
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:26,960
- My camel.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,835
- [Dad] And what gift are you gonna give?

30
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,085
- Frankincense.

31
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:34,529
- [Dad] Why did you choose
that to be your frankincense?

32
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:38,213
- Because it's a kind of oil just like it.

33
00:01:38,213 --> 00:01:39,296
Okay! Coming!

34
00:01:40,431 --> 00:01:44,598
(silly, high pitched voices
with Christmas music)

35
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,301
- [Dad] What are you guys doing?

36
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:07,801
- We're cleaning up Jesus' poop down here.

37
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,827
Because he pooped in here.

38
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:15,598
- Um, Baby Jesus need a diaper change.

39
00:02:19,157 --> 00:02:22,990
- I'll do it real quick
when I get this ready.

40
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,786
- I'm gonna do it.

41
00:02:31,822 --> 00:02:34,504
- [Sister] We're ready.

42
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:35,337
- Diaper.

43
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,799
Baby Jesus is back.

44
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:50,989
Done.

45
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:54,399
- [Dad] You're gonna be
such a gentle father.

46
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:55,334
You Joseph?

47
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,251
- Um, yeah.

48
00:02:58,196 --> 00:03:00,878
- It's time for Caleb to take a nap.

49
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,716
Oh, do you want him to come
sleep with you during nap time?

50
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,549
- Yeah.

51
00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:06,860
- Because I think Baby Jesus
wants to sleep with Joseph

52
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,943
for nap time.

53
00:03:08,943 --> 00:03:09,860
- And Mary.

54
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:15,032
- [Dad] I think Mary already took a nap.

55
00:03:15,032 --> 00:03:19,266
So Joseph is just going to
sleep with Jesus so that,

56
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:21,339
I think we're gonna have
Joseph just sleep with Jesus

57
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:24,001
so that Mary can go get some --

58
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,320
- Groceries.

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,379
- [Dad] What are you gonna get?

60
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,437
- Groceries.

61
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:30,266
- [Dad] Oh, she's gonna
go get some groceries.

62
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,366
You're just gonna put
Jesus down and lay with him

63
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:34,256
so that he'll fall asleep, okay?

64
00:03:34,256 --> 00:00:00,000
