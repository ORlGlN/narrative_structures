1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,317
- [Jeremy] What are alpacas?

2
00:00:01,317 --> 00:00:02,585
- I don't know.

3
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:03,920
We haven't seen 'em.

4
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,203
- [Jeremy] This is an alpaca right here.

5
00:00:06,203 --> 00:00:09,036
(bluegrass music)

6
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:13,210
(babbling)

7
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,377
- [Kendra] Do you think
you'd like alpaca clothes?

8
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:23,077
(pop music)

9
00:00:24,196 --> 00:00:26,693
♪ Don't want a complication ♪

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,797
♪ Complication, compli- compli- ♪

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,547
♪ Don't want a-- ♪

12
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:37,750
- So I was up this morning early

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:38,718
playing basketball with friends

14
00:00:38,718 --> 00:00:41,432
and now we're gonna be
cleaning our church.

15
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:44,265
(Classical music)

16
00:01:02,127 --> 00:01:03,743
- [Caleb] Man, I like cleanin' bathrooms!

17
00:01:03,743 --> 00:01:06,118
- [Jeremy] Why do you
like cleaning bathrooms?

18
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:08,201
- Just--
- You like having

19
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,531
that on your side?

20
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:14,114
(electronic hip-hop music)

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,280
Good job cleaning, peeps.

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,670
So as you know, I'm a lawyer

23
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,390
and one of the things that I've loved

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,889
over these years as we've been vlogging is

25
00:01:27,889 --> 00:01:29,950
when viewers have reached out

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,221
to get legal help from me

27
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,720
and I've been able to provide advice

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,500
and provide support and love.

29
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,190
It's really been one of
the most meaningful parts

30
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,930
of being a lawyer over
these last several years.

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,562
And Kendra and I talked

32
00:01:41,562 --> 00:01:42,395
about how we could do more of that,

33
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,749
how we can make it easier for viewers

34
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,470
if they need legal help,

35
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,480
to be able to reach out

36
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,366
and for us to provide that.

37
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,130
So what we've decided to do is

38
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,050
to put a link in the description box

39
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,140
of all of our vlogs.

40
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,281
So if you are needing legal help,

41
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,830
you can go there

42
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,528
and even if you're not
in the Kansas City area,

43
00:01:56,528 --> 00:01:57,922
we can provide legal help.

44
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:00,900
Or we can help connect you with someone

45
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,360
who would be the right fit for your case.

46
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,530
What I've loved about vlogging is

47
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,410
the relationships and the connections

48
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,400
that we're able to make with you,

49
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,889
and what I've loved
about being a lawyer is

50
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:10,837
helping people I care about.

51
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:14,078
And so these two things just
really go together well.

52
00:02:14,078 --> 00:02:15,865
I know that not all of you
are gonna need legal help

53
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:17,990
right now, but if that is something

54
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:19,059
that comes up, or someone you know

55
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:21,324
who is looking for help, send 'em my way.

56
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,350
- Well, I'm really proud of Jeremy.

57
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,840
He has been so disciplined this week.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,305
He lost ten pounds this week.

59
00:02:26,305 --> 00:02:27,440
- In six days.

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,882
This is my first thing to eat

61
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,913
after the cleanse.

62
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,293
- [Kendra] It's a healthy choice.

63
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:34,575
- [Laura] Can I have some?

64
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:36,803
- [Kendra] She wants a bite.

65
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,440
- Mmm, that was yummy.

66
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,432
- So Kendra found that there's a local

67
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:41,916
alpaca show going on.

68
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,428
What do you think an alpaca show is?

69
00:02:44,428 --> 00:02:48,790
- Like there's alpacans there?

70
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,700
That dances with us?

71
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,605
- [Jeremy] Dance with us?

72
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:53,093
What are alpacas?

73
00:02:53,093 --> 00:02:54,807
- I don't know.

74
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:55,873
We haven't seen 'em.

75
00:02:55,873 --> 00:02:57,410
- [Jeremy] What do you
think an alpaca show is?

76
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,790
- Is it like where you sit outside

77
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,683
and there's like a screen?

78
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,860
- [Jeremy] What's on the screen?

79
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,750
- A movie.

80
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,851
- Is it like a bird show?

81
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,250
- [Jeremy] What do you think, Isaac?

82
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,211
- Isn't it where those
like native people dance?

83
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:12,749
And they're dancing and
sometimes we might get

84
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:15,090
to join in?

85
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,583
- [Jeremy] Where do you guys
think an alpaca show is?

86
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:17,743
- Outside.

87
00:03:17,743 --> 00:03:19,803
- By a camp fire or something.

88
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,640
- Inside.
- [Jeremy] What do you think

89
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,912
kids are supposed to do at alpaca shows?

90
00:03:25,912 --> 00:03:26,890
- Play?

91
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,960
- So honestly I've never been
to an alpaca show either,

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,170
so let's go find out what it's all about.

93
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,330
- You don't know?

94
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,520
- [Jeremy] I have no idea
what is gonna happen here.

95
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,523
But I've seen pictures online.

96
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,640
Let's hope in the car, peeps.

97
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,733
- So usually I teach the kids about things

98
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:42,445
before we go see things,

99
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:45,051
but this time I kinda just
wanna let them discover it

100
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:46,909
on their own, see how that goes.

101
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,409
(upbeat electronic music)

102
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,405
So here's the poll question for today:

103
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,810
Before watching our video today,

104
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,710
did you know what an alpaca was?

105
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,710
Let us know up here.

106
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,503
So Laura, what's an alpaca?

107
00:04:14,503 --> 00:04:16,086
- Uh, I don't know.

108
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,172
- [Kendra] Don't know yet?

109
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,300
- This is an alpaca.

110
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,536
- [Jeremy] This is an alpaca right here.

111
00:04:21,536 --> 00:04:23,210
- Is it kind of like a sheep?

112
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,043
- [Jeremy] Kind of.

113
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:24,913
- [Kendra] It reminds me of a llama.

114
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:27,460
- [Jeremy] It's like a llama sheep.

115
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,293
- It is!

116
00:04:28,293 --> 00:04:32,449
- Alpaca, so the alpaca
that does the best gets the

117
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,916
first place ribbon?

118
00:04:37,916 --> 00:04:38,914
- [Jeremy] I guess so.

119
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:39,800
- [Kendra] It's like a competition.

120
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,587
- So it's like an animal show.

121
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:42,780
- [Jeremy] That's right.

122
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,735
She likes alpacas.

123
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:47,059
(barks like Janae when she sees a dog)

124
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,953
Do you see how they get down?

125
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,330
She's trying to bark.

126
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,481
She was trying to bark.

127
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:53,620
- That's the sound she makes for dogs.

128
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,151
These are alpacas!

129
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:58,901
(instrumental country music)

130
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:12,768
- [Jeremy] Okay everyone,
try to chew like an alpaca.

131
00:05:16,192 --> 00:05:17,790
- So Janae has signed horse

132
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:19,100
and she signed dog.

133
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,960
She's confused.

134
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,793
It's an alpaca.

135
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,317
- [Jeremy] What's that, oh.

136
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:26,180
- They're so cute.

137
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,900
- So apparently alpacas'
hair or wool or fur,

138
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,750
when used to make
clothes, creates something

139
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,970
that's really breathable and nice.

140
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,920
Look at their hair.

141
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,760
- So Caleb, do you hear that?

142
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,380
They shear them, which means cut off

143
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,580
all this fiber, which is their hair.

144
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,830
Once a year.

145
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,270
- [Jeremy] And then they use the hair

146
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,840
for blankets and clothes

147
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,761
and all kinds of stuff.

148
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,731
- [Kendra] And we'll
go see that over there.

149
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:10,148
(rock music)

150
00:06:19,224 --> 00:06:20,276
Feel that.

151
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:22,140
- [Jeremy] That's the fiber.

152
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,677
- So apparently they
call it fiber, not hair

153
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,810
or wool or fur or something like that.

154
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,110
So initially I was wondering

155
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:29,210
about all the fans in here,

156
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,101
because it's a cold day,

157
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,239
but then I realized
these alpacas have a lot

158
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:33,503
of fiber on them.

159
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:37,300
- What's the limit that alpacas can grow?

160
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,133
Like, how much feet?

161
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,781
- [Jeremy And Kendra] How tall?

162
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:43,548
- At the top of their head,
they're about five feet.

163
00:06:43,548 --> 00:06:46,381
(bluegrass music)

164
00:06:49,545 --> 00:06:51,153
- [Jeremy] She wants to walk.

165
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,628
- [Woman] Alpaca-vicuna,
which is like an alpaca.

166
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,500
- [Jeremy] Wow, can we
hold it, is that okay?

167
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,413
- [Woman] Yeah, you can.

168
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:06,450
- [Jeremy] So then the end
thing is it becomes yarn.

169
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,708
- [Kendra] And then they
make things out of the yarn.

170
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,303
- [Woman] This is a combo
of alpaca and acrylic.

171
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,603
You shear it, you give it a
big, short, butch haircut.

172
00:07:16,845 --> 00:07:19,678
(bluegrass music)

173
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:33,854
- [Kendra] Oh my
goodness, what do you say?

174
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,173
- [Elise] It's dyed.
- [Woman] You say thank you,

175
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:37,690
they already said it.

176
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,523
Pick it up and feel it.

177
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:42,917
- Thank you.

178
00:07:42,917 --> 00:07:44,250
- [Laura] Thank you.

179
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,900
- [Kendra] So you guys have little balls

180
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,340
of alpaca fiber.

181
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,528
- Literally turning into string.

182
00:07:49,528 --> 00:07:50,997
- [Kendra] It is.

183
00:07:50,997 --> 00:07:53,450
Wow, do you guys see?

184
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,838
She's pressing it with her foot.

185
00:07:54,838 --> 00:07:56,900
- This looks like a cinnamon roll.

186
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,934
- [Jeremy] Is that some
alpaca hair for you?

187
00:07:58,934 --> 00:07:59,767
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:07:59,767 --> 00:08:01,230
- So apparently when
they're judging alpacas,

189
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,593
they're looking at the body 50%,

190
00:08:02,593 --> 00:08:05,620
the hair 50% or the fiber

191
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,912
to see how tightly woven it is,

192
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,290
something like that.

193
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,123
- All right, this is it,

194
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,206
can you guys feel the intensity?

195
00:08:11,206 --> 00:08:12,200
- [Kids] No, yes.

196
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,980
- [Jeremy] Real alpaca judging.

197
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,120
We're at the Alpaca Super Bowl.

198
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,870
(dramatic music)

199
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:20,230
- Go, That Guy!
Go, That Guy!

200
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,000
- [Jeremy] Cheering for him?
- Yes.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,436
- Number 110 is his number.

202
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,834
- [Jeremy] Oh, did we have a favorite?

203
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:27,013
- Go, Alpaca 110.

204
00:08:27,013 --> 00:08:27,846
- That's a thing.

205
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:29,560
- [Jeremy] Yeah, we
should've brought signs.

206
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:33,030
(babbling)

207
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,104
She's cheering!

208
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:37,604
(upbeat electronic music)

209
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,861
Isn't that crazy soft?

210
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:50,361
(upbeat electronic music)

211
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:56,578
- This is so soft.

212
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,554
- It's really interesting
to see this whole process

213
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,836
from beginning to end, from the alpaca

214
00:09:00,836 --> 00:09:02,860
with the fiber on its body

215
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,040
to it being sheared and
then what they can do

216
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,180
with those fibers and making clothes

217
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,450
and other products.

218
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,900
It's so soft.

219
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
- So soft.

220
00:09:11,714 --> 00:09:13,040
- [Kendra] Do you think
you'd like alpaca clothes?

221
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,050
- It would make me warmer.

222
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,437
It would be cool to have pajamas.

223
00:09:16,437 --> 00:09:19,207
- Yeah, look, it's alpaca stuffed animals.

224
00:09:19,207 --> 00:09:21,120
Aren't they so cute?

225
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,797
I'm almost tempted to
buy some alpaca fiber

226
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:24,960
and try spinning it just 'cause I've never

227
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,793
done it before and I wonder

228
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:27,403
how it would feel to actually do that.

229
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:29,093
- [Jeremy] So, what'd you
think of the alpaca show?

230
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:32,665
- It was a lot different than I expected.

231
00:09:32,665 --> 00:09:33,980
- [Jeremy] What did you expect?

232
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,767
- I expected that the alpacas
would do tricks like--

233
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,320
- [Jeremy] More like a circus?

234
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,805
- Yeah.
- [Jeremy] That would be fun.

235
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:45,388
(upbeat music)

236
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,336
Laura, where are you headin'?

237
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:53,470
- To a birthday party.
- [Jeremy] Fun.

238
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,043
(upbeat music)

239
00:09:56,043 --> 00:09:57,407
- I think I would love this.

240
00:09:57,407 --> 00:09:58,920
I should get into this.

241
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,000
- [Jeremy] Definitely let out a lot

242
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,200
of that aggressive
energy that you (laughs).

243
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,759
- So we came to look for these things.

244
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,080
They're called dumbbells?

245
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,027
We're going to do some
weightlifting at home

246
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:14,321
and we need weights for that.

247
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:16,738
(funk music)

248
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,130
Jeremy and I are out on
our date night tonight

249
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,050
and we decided to stop
at this sports store

250
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,398
to get some dumbbells, but
now we're just having fun

251
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:31,261
checking out all the things.

252
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,810
So here's pickleball stuff.

253
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:34,240
There's supposed to be a pickleball place

254
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
close to us.

255
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,953
- I'll have to try it.

256
00:10:35,953 --> 00:10:36,786
I've never played.

257
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,933
- I bet I'd beat you.

258
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,830
Jeremy knew about this, but I did not.

259
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,930
A speed chute.

260
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,734
So you run with a parachute behind you

261
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:49,024
and then it makes you faster.

262
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,400
- [Jeremy] Well, when you're doing things

263
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,060
with resistance and then you
remove the resistance you--

264
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,530
- But still, don't you think it'd look

265
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,010
a little funny to run
around the neighborhood

266
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:57,843
with a parachute behind you?

267
00:10:57,843 --> 00:10:59,628
- [Jeremy] Definitely around
the neighborhood, yes.

268
00:10:59,628 --> 00:11:01,788
Why don't I just run
around with one of these?

269
00:11:01,788 --> 00:11:02,621
(Kendra laughs)

270
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,454
Dragging behind.

271
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,818
- [Kendra] Jeremy loves whiffle balls.

272
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:05,925
- Good memories.

273
00:11:05,925 --> 00:11:06,758
- [Kendra] And whiffle bats.

274
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:08,040
We had a whiffle bat for so long,

275
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,324
it got broken and then we duct taped it

276
00:11:09,324 --> 00:11:10,980
and kept using it.

277
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,880
- It's still good.

278
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,963
- [Kendra] Good memories.

279
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,363
End-of-the-day snuggles with dad.

280
00:11:18,433 --> 00:11:20,480
(Kendra laughing)

281
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,730
It's her favorite.

282
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,173
She climbs over and begs him to do that.

283
00:11:26,008 --> 00:11:29,597
- Dad.
- Dad, it's Dad.

284
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:32,430
(pretend-snoring)

285
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,769
(babbling)

286
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:44,680
(Kendra laughing)

287
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,890
- [Kendra] You can see
her, she kinda leans

288
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,723
her head back.

289
00:11:46,723 --> 00:11:48,003
She's ready for it.

290
00:11:52,938 --> 00:11:55,400
- [Laura] Good night, J House out.

291
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,997
- [Jeremy] We've been
having babies for ten years,

292
00:11:56,997 --> 00:11:58,540
by the way.

293
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,426
We've had someone in diapers.

294
00:11:59,426 --> 00:12:00,860
- We were talking about that.

295
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,693
- [Jeremy] For ten years.

296
00:12:01,693 --> 00:12:02,833
- It's been a decade.

297
00:12:04,962 --> 00:12:06,791
- Here, get in the air.

298
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,583
Come on, go.

299
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:10,767
(laughs)

300
00:12:10,767 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] What are you guys doing?
