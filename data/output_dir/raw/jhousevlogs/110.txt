1
00:00:00,404 --> 00:00:01,930
(energetic music)

2
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:04,763
- I think I have a heart attack.

3
00:00:04,763 --> 00:00:06,045
(kids screaming)

4
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:08,878
(energetic music)

5
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:17,531
(peaceful music)

6
00:00:28,569 --> 00:00:29,722
- So I'm out at the gym this morning

7
00:00:29,722 --> 00:00:33,962
and it was cold outside,
like below freezing.

8
00:00:33,962 --> 00:00:38,129
(energetic music)
(balls hitting wall)

9
00:00:48,063 --> 00:00:49,675
Good morning, Nae Nae.

10
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:51,644
How'd you sleep, buddy?

11
00:00:51,644 --> 00:00:52,782
- Good.

12
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:54,747
- [Jeremy] You're just waking up?

13
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,942
(kids clapping)
(peaceful music)

14
00:00:57,942 --> 00:00:59,473
- Mwah!

15
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:01,412
(kids clapping)

16
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:03,102
- [Jeremy] She's clapping.

17
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:04,385
She's clapping!

18
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:06,732
One, two, ready go!

19
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:10,990
♫ Twinkle twinkle little star

20
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,434
♫ How I wonder what you are

21
00:01:13,434 --> 00:01:15,676
♫ Up above the world so high

22
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,304
♫ What you are

23
00:01:18,304 --> 00:01:19,732
(girl giggling)

24
00:01:19,732 --> 00:01:21,920
Family band coming out on iTunes soon.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,753
(whooshing)

26
00:01:22,753 --> 00:01:25,111
- [Kendra] Where's your body hurt?

27
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:26,325
- Throat.

28
00:01:26,325 --> 00:01:27,950
- [Kendra] We've got
some sympathy sickness

29
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,037
over here, I think.

30
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:31,015
- And my heart is feeling--
- I'm sick.

31
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:32,695
- [Kendra] And your heart's feeling weird?

32
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:33,528
- Mm hm.

33
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:35,260
- My heart is sick too.

34
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,663
- [Kendra] Your heart is sick?

35
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,496
- Yeah.

36
00:01:37,496 --> 00:01:38,778
- [Kendra] How did your heart get sick?

37
00:01:38,778 --> 00:01:41,251
- I think I have a heart attack.

38
00:01:41,251 --> 00:01:42,084
- [Kendra] Yeah?

39
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,838
Are you worried about that
'cause Papa had a heart attack?

40
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,080
- Mm hm.

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,913
(yelling)

42
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:46,746
- You know what?

43
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:48,575
Caleb, you're not gonna
have a heart attack.

44
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,352
- It's common for kids.

45
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:52,101
- It's not common for kids.

46
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:53,987
I can still tell that the
kids are pretty affected

47
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:55,512
by Papa's heart attack.

48
00:01:55,512 --> 00:01:56,687
Just that they're concerned about it,

49
00:01:56,687 --> 00:01:58,937
worried about it, they've
still been talking about it,

50
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:00,314
asking if Papa's better.

51
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:02,207
And then today when Caleb
said his throat was hurting,

52
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:03,778
he also said his heart was hurting

53
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:05,659
and he's worried he's
having a heart attack too.

54
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:06,644
These things that we go through

55
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:09,356
affect each child so differently.

56
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:11,591
Well we'll keep a close eye on you, okay?

57
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,424
(whooshing)

58
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,704
So when my sister Tiffany came
for our big special event,

59
00:02:13,704 --> 00:02:16,670
she brought stuff to do a
fun activity with the kids

60
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,122
and we ended up not having time for it.

61
00:02:18,122 --> 00:02:19,502
So we're gonna do that activity today.

62
00:02:19,502 --> 00:02:21,957
So this morning, we're going
to make homemade lava lamps.

63
00:02:21,957 --> 00:02:23,818
Step one, empty the bottle.

64
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:25,523
- [Jeremy] Keep going that
direction and you'll get it.

65
00:02:25,523 --> 00:02:27,044
(soft music)

66
00:02:27,044 --> 00:02:29,943
- Do you really expect
us to drink all this?

67
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,193
- [Kendra] Yup.

68
00:02:32,032 --> 00:02:33,072
I'm just joking.

69
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:34,359
You're almost done, you're almost there.

70
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:35,899
Keep going, keep going!

71
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:37,557
- Pour a little out.

72
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,044
(water pouring)

73
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,995
- Step two, fill the bottle three quarters

74
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,715
of the way full with vegetable oil.

75
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,281
- Is this three quarters?

76
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,114
- [Kendra] I think so.

77
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:48,533
Alright Isaac, where do you
think three quarters is?

78
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:50,518
- Well, that's about half.

79
00:02:50,518 --> 00:02:51,991
I think it'd be about right here.

80
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:52,824
- [Kendra] Perfect.

81
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:54,767
(soft music)

82
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:55,835
- Stop!

83
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,216
Whoa.

84
00:02:57,216 --> 00:03:00,014
(soft music)

85
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,044
- Stop!

86
00:03:01,044 --> 00:03:02,853
- Step three, add water.

87
00:03:02,853 --> 00:03:05,209
You want to leave one
inch open at the top.

88
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:07,398
- Watch what happens with water and oil.

89
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:09,599
What's gonna be on top,
the water or the oil?

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,564
- [Kids] Oil.

91
00:03:10,564 --> 00:03:11,980
- Let's see.

92
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,886
- Oil.

93
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:15,084
(fun music)

94
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:16,543
And then the water's down here.

95
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:19,713
(fun music)
- Ooh!

96
00:03:19,713 --> 00:03:21,083
- There it is.
- Look!

97
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,679
It's like a, water.

98
00:03:22,679 --> 00:03:23,929
It's beautiful.

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,333
(fun music)

100
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:34,451
- I'm getting nervous the kids are gonna

101
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:36,152
knock these over while they're open.

102
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:38,200
I don't want to clean up oil all over.

103
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,322
- [Kendra] That would be a big mess.

104
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:40,155
- Yep.

105
00:03:40,155 --> 00:03:41,092
- So everybody be careful!

106
00:03:41,092 --> 00:03:45,119
This morning, I'm wearing my
very first pair of Lu-La-Roo?

107
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:46,044
Is that how you say it?

108
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:46,877
Leggings.

109
00:03:46,877 --> 00:03:47,779
LuLaRoe?

110
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:48,612
I don't know how to say it.

111
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:50,496
But I'm wearing my very
first pair of those leggings

112
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,712
and I've been like, what is the big deal?

113
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:55,265
And now I'm like, oh.

114
00:03:55,265 --> 00:03:56,335
Oh, this is the big deal.

115
00:03:56,335 --> 00:03:58,217
They are so comfortable.

116
00:03:58,217 --> 00:04:00,481
I never want to take them off.

117
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,640
So if you notice in the
vlogs that I'm wearing them

118
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,608
all the time, that's why!

119
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:05,984
It's because they're so comfortable.

120
00:04:05,984 --> 00:04:06,992
Jeremy, I think you would honestly

121
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,011
really enjoy wearing the leggings.

122
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,480
- I've already worn 'em a couple times.

123
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,313
(Kendra laughs)

124
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:12,146
I'm just kidding.

125
00:04:12,146 --> 00:04:13,331
And this isn't sponsored, by the way.

126
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,112
- Step four, add 10
drops of food coloring.

127
00:04:16,112 --> 00:04:18,358
(clapping)
Food coloring.

128
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,190
Right, Laura.

129
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,023
What color did you choose?

130
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:20,857
- Red.

131
00:04:20,857 --> 00:04:21,690
- Red?

132
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,617
What color do you think it's gonna turn?

133
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:23,450
- Pink.

134
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,283
- Yup.

135
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:25,116
That's what we're hoping for.

136
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:27,212
- [Both] One, two.

137
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:31,379
- Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten!

138
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:34,943
- Good job!

139
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,279
Look at 'em floating!

140
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,693
- [Jeremy] Look, it's
all just sitting there.

141
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:40,737
- That's awesome.
- That is so cool.

142
00:04:40,737 --> 00:04:43,458
- [Jeremy] There it is!

143
00:04:43,458 --> 00:04:44,528
- [Kendra] It broke through!

144
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:45,562
- [Kid] It's beautiful.

145
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:46,395
- [Kid] One broke through.

146
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:47,841
- [Kendra] It looks like a tornado.

147
00:04:47,841 --> 00:04:48,674
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it does.

148
00:04:48,674 --> 00:04:51,091
- No, that looks like a neck.

149
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,703
I think--

150
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:56,286
(techno music)

151
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,447
- I'm gonna do green.

152
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,280
Nine, ten.

153
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:07,806
(techno music)

154
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:14,976
- Step five, add glitter.

155
00:05:14,976 --> 00:05:18,121
So Aunt Tiffany got us a
fun variety of glitters.

156
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:19,782
What color glitter?

157
00:05:19,782 --> 00:05:21,152
- Pink.

158
00:05:21,152 --> 00:05:23,019
- It's about to go!

159
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:25,602
(techno music)

160
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:33,341
(Elise laughing)

161
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:35,786
- 'Cause I love glitter.

162
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:39,953
(techno music)
(family cheering)

163
00:05:44,743 --> 00:05:45,844
- Whoa!

164
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:48,533
- The last step is to
add Alka-Seltzer tablets

165
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,629
broken up into pieces.

166
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,803
Who can say the word Alka-Seltzer?

167
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:52,970
- Alka sester.

168
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:55,216
(Jeremy laughs)

169
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:57,199
- [Kids] Alka sester.

170
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,925
- Alka sester!

171
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,066
- Alka-Seltzer.

172
00:06:00,066 --> 00:06:03,394
(violin music)

173
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,236
- [Kendra] Guys, look what it's doing!

174
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:06,069
Oh my goodness.

175
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,986
They're like bubbling up from the bottom!

176
00:06:07,986 --> 00:06:10,344
- [Kid] They're like glitter balls.

177
00:06:10,344 --> 00:06:11,177
- [Kendra] They are.

178
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,033
It's like glitter balls.

179
00:06:12,033 --> 00:06:13,763
- What are we gonna do with the lava?

180
00:06:13,763 --> 00:06:15,618
- [Kendra] When you shake
it up, it does it again.

181
00:06:15,618 --> 00:06:17,355
(violin music)

182
00:06:17,355 --> 00:06:18,188
- Oh.

183
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:19,021
- [Kendra] Oh.

184
00:06:19,021 --> 00:06:19,887
She's processing.

185
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,864
- For Caleb's, we're gonna put
in two instead of just one.

186
00:06:22,864 --> 00:06:27,031
(violin music)
(tablets dropping)

187
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:30,307
- Look at it bubblin' up!
- Whoa.

188
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,612
Going into big chunks and then coming up.

189
00:06:32,612 --> 00:06:33,482
- Oh.

190
00:06:33,482 --> 00:06:34,315
My.

191
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:35,148
Goodness.

192
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,043
This is awesome!

193
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:37,585
(kids giggling)
- Can I have the lid?

194
00:06:37,585 --> 00:06:38,937
- [Kendra] Are you nervous about the lid?

195
00:06:38,937 --> 00:06:39,770
- Yeah.

196
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:45,028
(soft music)
(truck running)

197
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:53,775
(bin rolling)

198
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:55,536
- I'm gonna put in four!

199
00:06:55,536 --> 00:06:56,505
- [Jeremy] Four tablets.

200
00:06:56,505 --> 00:06:57,776
- What do you think's gonna happen?

201
00:06:57,776 --> 00:06:59,620
- It's gonna explode!

202
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,405
(fun music)
(tablets dropping)

203
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:05,624
Oh my!
- Look at that!

204
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:07,140
Look at it go!
- Whoa.

205
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,032
- [Kid] Whoa!

206
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:12,199
(kids screaming)
(energetic music)

207
00:07:15,922 --> 00:07:17,922
- [Kid] This is awesome.

208
00:07:19,508 --> 00:07:22,478
- [Kendra] Well that's what
happens if you put a bunch in.

209
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:24,145
- No, don't get two!

210
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:26,675
- [Jeremy] Does it make
you a little nervous?

211
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:27,508
(Laura crying)

212
00:07:27,508 --> 00:07:28,341
- Sweetheart, sweetheart.

213
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:29,174
Look.

214
00:07:29,174 --> 00:07:30,007
Look, it's just fine.

215
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:33,838
It just made a little tiny bit of a mess.

216
00:07:33,838 --> 00:07:34,854
- [Jeremy] It's gonna be fine.

217
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:35,781
- [Kid] That is a lot.

218
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:37,069
- We can clean it up?

219
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:38,523
- Of course we'll clean it up.

220
00:07:38,523 --> 00:07:41,106
(techno music)

221
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:45,610
- [Kendra] So pretty.

222
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,193
(techno music)

223
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:57,734
- Thank you, Aunt Tiffany!

224
00:07:57,734 --> 00:07:59,014
- Thank you, Aunt Tiffany!

225
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:01,527
- Thank you, Aunt Tiffany.

226
00:08:01,527 --> 00:08:03,095
- [Kendra] Hi, Janae.

227
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:04,674
Hello!

228
00:08:04,674 --> 00:08:06,700
Oh, we missed you!

229
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,667
(Jeremy kisses Janae)

230
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,636
We're glad you got a good nap, though.

231
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:10,830
She's like, I want you to hold me.

232
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,663
- Gimme milk.

233
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:12,946
- [Kendra] How do I get to Mum?

234
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:13,779
- Hi.

235
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:14,612
Mwah.

236
00:08:18,308 --> 00:08:20,010
There's Daddy.

237
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,735
(Jeremy making baby sounds)

238
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,883
The kids are gettin' going
on some more serious school.

239
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:25,630
Isaac is studying volcanoes today

240
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,669
and he's gonna give a little report

241
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:28,055
to our family about them.

242
00:08:28,055 --> 00:08:30,423
Caleb is back laying down on the couch,

243
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:31,555
which lets me know that he really

244
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,308
is not feeling 100 percent.

245
00:08:33,308 --> 00:08:36,790
But he's reading a book
about the Statue of Liberty.

246
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:38,248
(soft music)

247
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:39,243
- Root beer is very cheap.

248
00:08:39,243 --> 00:08:40,076
It's one dollar.

249
00:08:40,076 --> 00:08:41,924
- For math today, Elise is
doing the coolest thing.

250
00:08:41,924 --> 00:08:44,751
It's called Menu Math and
she literally has a menu

251
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:46,348
and then she's doing orders.

252
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:49,390
So here's the menu, and
then she takes the prices

253
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,491
and fills in the orders for people.

254
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,416
By the way, I love the way
you did your hair today.

255
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,741
- Thank you.

256
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,328
- [Kendra] So apparently
Jeremy grew a tail.

257
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,995
(kids laughing)

258
00:09:03,496 --> 00:09:05,743
I don't know why anyone
would want to put their heads

259
00:09:05,743 --> 00:09:08,112
that close to Jeremy's bum!

260
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,304
(kids squealing)

261
00:09:10,304 --> 00:09:12,054
Aren't they so funny?

262
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,159
She's gonna be so confused about

263
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,755
what people are supposed to do.

264
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,067
- What are normal people like?

265
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:19,650
(kids yelling)

266
00:09:21,467 --> 00:09:23,562
- So we're having soup,
chicken noodle soup

267
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,759
for dinner and rolls.

268
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,908
Smells really good.

269
00:09:26,908 --> 00:09:29,658
(peaceful music)

270
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:40,051
The soup is way too hot for the kids.

271
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:41,263
So poll question for today.

272
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,724
To cracker or not to cracker?

273
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:46,680
Do you like putting crackers
in your soup, yes or no?

274
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,513
- Yes!

275
00:09:47,513 --> 00:09:48,346
- [Jeremy] You like it?

276
00:09:48,346 --> 00:09:49,179
- I'm with Elise.

277
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,012
- [Jeremy] Is everyone yes?

278
00:09:50,012 --> 00:09:50,845
Maybe it's a bad question.

279
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:52,207
Does everyone like crackers in their soup?

280
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,505
- I don't prefer crackers in my soup.

281
00:09:54,505 --> 00:09:55,995
- [Jeremy] There we go.

282
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:56,828
I do.

283
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,313
When I was younger, I
didn't like it as much

284
00:09:58,313 --> 00:10:00,345
'cause they got all soggy and
I thought that was kinda gross

285
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:01,930
but now, I like it.

286
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,164
- Mm hm.

287
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:05,483
Now you put corn bread in it.

288
00:10:05,483 --> 00:10:06,729
- [Jeremy] Yeah, I do all
kinds of weird things.

289
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:07,915
- You put everything in your soup.

290
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:08,748
- [Jeremy] It's true.

291
00:10:08,748 --> 00:10:11,915
(dance music playing)

292
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,843
He's just standing here.

293
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:20,010
(dance music playing)

294
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,322
You feelin' a little bit better, Caleb?

295
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:30,685
- Yep!

296
00:10:30,685 --> 00:10:31,887
- Hi, you!

297
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:32,720
Ah!

298
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:36,268
This girl's just happy all the time.

299
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,663
- [Jeremy] Well, not all the time.

300
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,773
- Well, most of the time!
- But a lot of the time!

301
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,773
- Just most of the time!

302
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:43,978
- [Jeremy] She's so tired right now.

303
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,723
- She's tired.

304
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:46,606
- [Jeremy] I love you, girl.

305
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:47,890
- [Kendra] Boo!

306
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:48,723
Hi.

307
00:10:48,723 --> 00:10:50,555
Please say, ma ma ma ma ma.

308
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:51,569
- [Jeremy] You got a tongue.

309
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:52,709
- You're so fun!

310
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,542
Oh!

311
00:10:53,542 --> 00:10:55,327
(Kendra kisses Janae)

312
00:10:55,327 --> 00:10:56,691
Oh, we love you!

313
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,740
(kissing)

314
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,573
- [Kid Voiceover] Good night.

315
00:10:58,573 --> 00:10:59,464
J House out.

316
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:00,463
(dance music)

317
00:11:00,463 --> 00:11:01,480
- Hi guys!

318
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,787
Guys, there's a line outside!

319
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,731
(kids yelling)

320
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,508
- [Jeremy] Look, they made J House shirts.

321
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:07,557
How cool is that?

322
00:11:07,557 --> 00:00:00,000
(dance music)
