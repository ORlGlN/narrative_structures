1
00:00:01,299 --> 00:00:04,296
- [Caleb] It moved on me! It moved!

2
00:00:04,296 --> 00:00:05,250
(Jeremy laughs)

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,083
It moved!

4
00:00:06,978 --> 00:00:08,680
- [Kendra] Is the tide coming in?

5
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:12,964
(orchestral music)

6
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,649
So our kids are so
exhausted from all the fun

7
00:00:20,649 --> 00:00:22,530
that we've been having lately.

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,995
I'm actually having to
wake them up this morning,

9
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:27,030
which is crazy, that never happens.

10
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,798
Well, not these two, they're still awake.

11
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:30,464
Good morning, Caleb.

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,140
Oh man, they're like sound asleep.

13
00:00:36,408 --> 00:00:38,336
Good morning, Leesie.

14
00:00:38,336 --> 00:00:39,729
Hi sweetheart.

15
00:00:39,729 --> 00:00:40,872
- Good morning.

16
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:43,470
- [Kendra] Ready for a day of life?

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,303
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:45,851
- I walked a lot.

19
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,194
- [Kendra] Yeah, we have.

20
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:48,690
Well then you're in
trouble, 'cause we're going

21
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:49,967
on a hike today.

22
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,484
- Uh oh...

23
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,567
Puh-zyeti-oh.

24
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,820
(Kendra chuckles)

25
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,470
- [Kendra] Dude, that kid is out.

26
00:00:57,532 --> 00:01:01,132
There he is, good morning.

27
00:01:01,132 --> 00:01:03,558
- What time is it?

28
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:08,320
- It is so late, you slept so awesome!

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,600
High five for sleeping!

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,456
So this is a huge deal in our family,

31
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:15,790
because usually Caleb is
one of the first kids awake,

32
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,456
and so he is learning to sleep!

33
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:19,450
Good job, big guy!

34
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,782
I'm so proud of you!

35
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:21,615
(Caleb chuckles)

36
00:01:21,615 --> 00:01:24,615
(light piano music)

37
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,075
Well, it's so sad because we're coming up

38
00:01:29,075 --> 00:01:30,556
to our last week here in San Diego,

39
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:32,163
and my list of things
that I want to do here,

40
00:01:32,163 --> 00:01:33,690
we haven't done it all.

41
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,265
And so I'm trying to
start, like, packing it in.

42
00:01:35,265 --> 00:01:36,409
So the kids are getting up early

43
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:37,843
so they can get their schoolwork done,

44
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:40,601
and their chores done, and
we can get out and play.

45
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,434
(classical music)

46
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,320
We made breakfast cake.

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,386
- [Jeremy] Who wants some breakfast cake?

48
00:01:47,386 --> 00:01:48,251
- [Kids] Me.

49
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:51,918
- [Kendra] They're,
like, already eating it.

50
00:01:56,287 --> 00:01:57,120
- Birdie!

51
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,003
Birdie!

52
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:02,052
Birdie, I'm down here.

53
00:02:02,052 --> 00:02:04,215
I want the bird to land on my finger.

54
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:06,105
- [Jeremy] You want it to swoop
down and land right there?

55
00:02:06,105 --> 00:02:07,340
- Yeah.

56
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,249
- [Jeremy] Did it fly away?

57
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:09,082
- Yeah.

58
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,455
- [Jeremy] I'm so sorry.

59
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:11,976
- Maybe the parents can yell out loud,

60
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:13,694
and it will go to you.

61
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,720
- [Jeremy] Maybe if I yell
at the bird it might come?

62
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,553
- Yeah.

63
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,193
- [Jeremy] You know, birds out in the wild

64
00:02:18,193 --> 00:02:20,790
rarely come and land on your finger.

65
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,640
Unless it's a seagull and
you have a granola bar.

66
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,181
And a seagull flew by and took the whole

67
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:28,500
granola bar out of her
hands, and flew away.

68
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,991
- [Kendra] And flew off with it.

69
00:02:29,991 --> 00:02:31,577
- [Jeremy] You remember that?

70
00:02:31,577 --> 00:02:32,410
- Yeah.

71
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,618
- [Jeremy] Yeah. (chuckles)

72
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:36,035
(jazz music)

73
00:02:36,985 --> 00:02:40,110
- [Kendra] Caleb is working
so hard on his math today.

74
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,832
He is writing the
numbers from zero to 100.

75
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:44,753
And it's the best
handwriting I've ever seen

76
00:02:44,753 --> 00:02:46,460
him do with numbers.

77
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,293
How far are you?

78
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:48,280
- 39.

79
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,780
- [Kendra] Do you think you
can make it all the way to 100?

80
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,960
- Mm-hmm, I've done it before, wanna see?

81
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,793
- [Kendra] So here's--

82
00:02:52,793 --> 00:02:54,072
- [Caleb] That's a lot sloppier.

83
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:56,190
- [Kendra] Yeah, it is.
Now show us today's.

84
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,952
Boom. Way to go, mister
kindergarten pants.

85
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:02,619
(Caleb giggles)

86
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,542
(Janae pants)

87
00:03:06,542 --> 00:03:09,350
You are getting so close!

88
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,339
Oh, look at her go!

89
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:16,006
(Janae giggles)

90
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,540
(keyboard tones)

91
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,023
So while we're here in San
Diego, we do not have a piano,

92
00:03:25,023 --> 00:03:26,513
and so the kids have been doing this app

93
00:03:26,513 --> 00:03:28,408
to be able to do some piano practice.

94
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,375
It's not the same at all,
but at least they're like,

95
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,830
thinking about notes and
rhythm and music and beats

96
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:35,430
and then we'll get back
into piano when we get home.

97
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:43,743
Whatcha readin'?

98
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:44,823
- Percy Jackson.

99
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:45,806
- [Kendra] Nice.

100
00:03:45,806 --> 00:03:48,810
Laura's in her happy
place, playing with water.

101
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,368
Do you know how to use that one?

102
00:03:53,368 --> 00:03:55,259
- [Laura] Mm-hmm.

103
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,250
(laughs)

104
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,087
- [Kendra] What'd you find?

105
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:01,670
(Janae grunts)

106
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:05,070
- No shells!

107
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,761
- I'm trying to finish
a thumbnail for a video

108
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:09,404
that we're posting,
and I'm just struggling

109
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:10,934
to make it all work.

110
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:13,222
- [Kendra] YouTube life, back at it.

111
00:04:13,222 --> 00:04:16,997
And I'm on dish duty, I've
unloaded, I've reloaded,

112
00:04:16,997 --> 00:04:18,827
now I'm washing the bigger stuff.

120
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:30,940
- Both Elise and I were
in here, just hoping

121
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,102
that you were vlogging the
goodness that was being sung.

00:04:44,269 --> 00:04:46,181
So the kitchen's finally
all the way clean,

130
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:48,077
and I turn around, and
I look at the clock,

131
00:04:48,077 --> 00:04:50,552
it's almost lunchtime.

132
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:52,053
It's life, the circle of life.

133
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,040
Dishes, food, dishes, food.

134
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,150
I'm grateful to have food
to eat and dishes to eat on,

135
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,580
and hands to clean with.

136
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,347
- Dad, I'm gonna get in my office.

137
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:06,680
- [Jeremy] 'Kay.

138
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,253
(bouncy music)

139
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,720
- First stop on our itinerary
today is the post office.

140
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,969
We are paying our taxes and sending off

141
00:05:24,969 --> 00:05:26,430
those postcards to friends.

142
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,593
- [Jeremy] Are you my helper?

143
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,426
- Yep.

144
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,604
We're next in line.

145
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:33,290
- [Jeremy] Yes.

146
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,060
And then I was wanting these also shipped.

147
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,893
Thanks for helping.

148
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:39,287
(Caleb giggles)

149
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,420
- We happened upon a fun
pizza place for lunch today.

150
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:46,959
(bright music)

151
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,352
Is it bright and sunny out?

152
00:05:54,352 --> 00:05:56,182
This restaurant has a really cool setup.

153
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:57,935
We're eating right here, and our kids

154
00:05:57,935 --> 00:06:00,070
are eating right there!

155
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,863
Cool kids.

156
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,430
- [Laura] Wuh-wuh!

157
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:11,037
- So we bought pizza by
the slice and chose a bunch

158
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,054
of their fun gourmet pizzas.

159
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:14,886
- [Kendra] So we get to try them all.

160
00:06:14,886 --> 00:06:18,190
And they have amazing breadsticks.

161
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,737
- [Jeremy] How's the pizza?

162
00:06:19,737 --> 00:06:21,008
- Really good.

163
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:24,112
- So this place has stuffed garlic knots.

164
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,000
This has ricotta, spinach, and mozzarella.

165
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,968
It's really good.

166
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:30,906
- [Jeremy] And their
marinara sauce is very good.

167
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:31,840
- Mm-hmm.

168
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,460
Can you say more? More?

169
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,361
How do I say more?

170
00:06:37,361 --> 00:06:40,578
She likes the crust.

171
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:44,160
So we just discovered that
Laura was sneaky today.

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,680
Ah! (laughs) Did you decide
to wear your swimsuit?

173
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,001
(Laura giggles)

174
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:49,680
I am not going home.

175
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,520
I am staying here in the sunshine forever!

176
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:56,720
(harmonica plays)

177
00:07:02,508 --> 00:07:04,174
- [Kendra] This is awesome!

178
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,777
- [Jeremy] Do you guys know
what instrument that is?

179
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:07,222
- It's a harmonica.

180
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,414
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

181
00:07:08,414 --> 00:07:11,105
So this nice guy just stopped
and started playing for us

182
00:07:11,105 --> 00:07:12,598
as we were walking to our car.

183
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,830
- Hey, do you guys wanna clap for him?

184
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,663
Awesome!

185
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:20,445
(energetic music)

186
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,785
Tide pools provide a
home for many animals.

187
00:07:52,785 --> 00:07:56,567
Tide pools are created by the
changing water level or tides.

188
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,009
The high energy waves
make this a harsh habitat,

189
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:01,620
but the animals living here
have adapted over time.

190
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:08,740
(relaxed music)

191
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:18,910
- [Jeremy] Hey, Laura.

192
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:21,500
Good thing you got your swimming suit on.

193
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,470
So one of the things
Kendra most wanted to do

194
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,503
in San Diego was go tide pooling.

195
00:08:25,503 --> 00:08:26,823
It's when the tide is way out,

196
00:08:26,823 --> 00:08:28,690
and you come to the pools of water

197
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,320
that are left to look for creatures.

198
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,620
It's like a treasure hunt.

199
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,839
And we brought our galoshes
from Kansas City for this day.

200
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,256
- Oh yeah we did.

201
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,195
- [Jeremy] Isn't that cool, you guys?

202
00:08:39,196 --> 00:08:41,320
Like, it's its own little
pool of water here.

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,176
- [Kendra] Do you see it grows
all the way along the inside.

204
00:08:44,176 --> 00:08:45,360
- [Isaac] What's this?

205
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,782
- Coralline red algae.

206
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:48,473
Oh, is that a snail?

207
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:51,270
'Kay, so feel that right there, so softly.

208
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:54,110
That is called coralline red algae.

209
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,393
So do you guys see all of these?

210
00:08:55,393 --> 00:08:59,005
These are called gooseneck barnacles.

211
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:01,755
(pleasant music)

212
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,050
Yeah, there's seaweed and seagrass.

213
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,910
I had no idea there was seagrass.

214
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,810
- [Jeremy] It's green, it
must get a lot of water here.

215
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:15,936
- [Kendra] Let's go over there.

216
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,340
Here's some more red algae.

217
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:25,050
- [Jeremy] What is that?

218
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,054
- [Isaac] It's a starfish.

219
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:28,226
- [Jeremy] A starfish.

220
00:09:28,226 --> 00:09:30,213
- [Kendra] It's so cool.

221
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:31,777
- [Jeremy] Do you see how
it's wrapped around the rock?

222
00:09:31,777 --> 00:09:32,699
- [Isaac] Mm-hmm.

223
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,243
- It's like a rock.

224
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:37,420
- [Jeremy] Yeah. Laura's comin'.

225
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,643
(Laura laughs)

226
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:49,922
- [Kendra] Do you see right there?

227
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:55,989
That one is called sponge
weed or dead man's fingers.

228
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:58,644
- Laura got some water in her boots.

229
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:01,450
- [Elise] Some of them are actually stuck.

230
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:03,560
- [Kendra] So we're finding
bunches of little snails.

231
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,354
Ah, I can feel it!

232
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,970
Put it back in its home.

233
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:12,771
- A huge shell! We got to show Mom!

234
00:10:12,771 --> 00:10:14,170
- [Jeremy] Look at it.

235
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,880
So a big wave could come and knock us.

236
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,611
I have a bad habit of trying
to get too close to the waves.

237
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,428
(laughs)

238
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:25,941
Are we gonna get all wet?

239
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:27,842
It definitely could happen.

240
00:10:27,842 --> 00:10:30,426
(laughs) That was close.

241
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,650
What I love about this kind of an activity

242
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,950
is the adventure of it.

243
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,335
It's like a treasure hunt,
trying to find what's out here,

244
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,224
trying not to get hit by the waves,

245
00:10:38,224 --> 00:10:41,640
trying not to fall in the
water, climbing down the rocks.

246
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,990
I love that our kids
are getting adventurous,

247
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,160
and it's educational.

248
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,003
You guys see that?

249
00:10:48,003 --> 00:10:49,353
- [Caleb] Yeah, I see it.

250
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,182
- [Jeremy] What is it?

251
00:10:51,182 --> 00:10:52,856
- [Caleb] It's soft!

252
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,537
- [Jeremy] And it moved!
- [Caleb] It moved!

253
00:10:54,537 --> 00:10:56,192
It moved on me!

254
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:58,416
It moved! It moved!

255
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:01,465
(Jeremy laughs)

256
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:03,430
There's so much!

257
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:06,940
- So these circular shaped
creatures are sea urchins.

258
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:10,120
(Elise yelps)

259
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,290
- So tide pooling was on my must-do list,

260
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,180
but honestly, I was a
little bit nervous about it.

261
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,450
I didn't know what to
expect, I've never done

262
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,184
anything like it before, and so I kind of

263
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,830
subconsciously was procrastinating it.

264
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,800
Like, I'm like, oh
we'll do it another day,

265
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,288
and now our time is starting to run out,

266
00:11:22,288 --> 00:11:23,920
and so we decided to come out here today,

267
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,334
but I still was like, I
don't know what to expect.

268
00:11:26,334 --> 00:11:29,416
And it is so fun, and it
just makes me really grateful

269
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:32,520
to come out and, you know, be brave,

270
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,353
even when you don't know exactly

271
00:11:33,353 --> 00:11:35,470
what you're getting into, give it a try.

272
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,160
Here's the tide, coming in.

273
00:11:41,081 --> 00:11:42,733
Janae just wants to get
down and I obviously

274
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,682
can't let her down, and so
she's getting a little fidgety.

275
00:11:45,682 --> 00:11:47,155
(Janae cries)

276
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,378
Naenae's not too happy, so
Jeremy's taking the girls back.

277
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:52,356
- We traded. Come on.

278
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:54,586
- Laura needs to go potty
and Janae's just done

279
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:57,030
with this experience for now.

280
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,860
So I'm gonna bring the
big kids in a minute.

281
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,347
Is the tide coming in?

282
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:05,180
- [Caleb] Yeah!

283
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,251
- [Kendra] Is it time to go?

284
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:07,730
- [Kids] No!

285
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,476
- [Kendra] Check out this seashell!

286
00:12:09,476 --> 00:12:11,784
Oh my goodness, it's beautiful!

287
00:12:11,784 --> 00:12:13,896
What'd you find, Isaac?

288
00:12:13,896 --> 00:12:15,241
- A squid.

289
00:12:15,241 --> 00:12:16,550
- A squid?

290
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,022
So we learned that the
sea anemones are open

291
00:12:18,022 --> 00:12:22,190
so that they can eat and
defecate, which is poop,

292
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,119
and that they eat phytoplankton,

293
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:26,180
which is microscopic plants.

294
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:29,690
Do you guys wanna go see the
lighthouse before we go home?

295
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,523
- [Isaac] Sure.

296
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:36,190
- I love how, when we
first arrive somewhere,

297
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:38,189
the kids are all timid and cautious,

298
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:40,226
and then by the end, they're
like scampering about,

299
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,268
so excited and I just
love seeing that progress.

300
00:12:43,268 --> 00:12:45,239
So we're done tide pooling,
and now we're gonna

301
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:47,005
drive up to the lighthouse.

302
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:48,502
- What is that?

303
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,440
- [Kendra] It's a house
that has a big light on top.

304
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,716
So we were at the tide
pools near Point Loma,

305
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:59,900
and so we had to come over to the Cabrillo

306
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,990
National Monument, which has
a beautiful view of San Diego.

307
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,823
Check this out.

308
00:13:03,823 --> 00:13:05,606
You can see everything.

309
00:13:05,606 --> 00:13:08,450
So this is a monument of
Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo,

310
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,928
and he was the first European to discover

311
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:13,410
the California western coast back in 1542.

312
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,217
The first three sailing vessels to enter

313
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:23,090
San Diego Bay came from the
direction you are facing.

314
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,900
Wow.

315
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,019
San Diego's first lighthouse
guided ships along the coast

316
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,810
and marked the entrance to
the harbor for over 30 years.

317
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,059
I'm not taking a picture,
sweetheart, I'm taking a video.

318
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:38,142
(laughs)

319
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,210
This is a real lighthouse, guys.

320
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,145
- [Jeremy] So at the
lighthouse, they've blocked off

321
00:13:58,145 --> 00:14:01,120
getting up into the top
room, but we can see it.

322
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:15,440
- Beautiful.

323
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,289
- [Jeremy] So this is what
the light looks like up there.

324
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,139
They had to magnify the light so it could

325
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,936
shine out super far.

326
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:23,890
I'm guessing, I don't know it
all, I have to read about it.

327
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,081
- Like a fire, they had to
have lenses and mirrors.

328
00:14:29,081 --> 00:14:30,200
- [Jeremy] So we're learning about

329
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,190
the history of lighthouses.

330
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,167
They used to be very complex.

331
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:36,150
Now, this is like a modern lighthouse.

332
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,014
Very simple.

333
00:14:37,014 --> 00:14:39,025
Most lighthouses aren't
even staffed nowadays,

334
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:41,140
and they said that
sailors still rely on them

335
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:43,488
as they navigate, even
though they have GPS

336
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:46,940
and all the other technology
that we have today.

337
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,167
- Does anyone have a penny?

338
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,590
- [Jeremy] Mexico over there.

339
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:03,397
You can see all along.

340
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,340
Well the ranger just came
and told us they've closed,

341
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,550
so we're gonna head to dinner.

342
00:15:17,609 --> 00:15:20,359
(pleasant music)

343
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,345
(Laura laughs)

344
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:33,948
- Keeping it real.

345
00:15:33,948 --> 00:15:37,640
We have some tired and maybe
grumpy children. (chuckles)

346
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,638
And so we had planned
to go to a restaurant

347
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,880
and try out something
new tonight for dinner,

348
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,318
but it's time to come
home, so we're eating

349
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,829
deluxe gourmet peanut
butter and honey sandwiches

350
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:49,211
for dinner, and then we're
going to put the kids to bed.

351
00:15:49,211 --> 00:15:51,300
- Goodnight, J House out.

352
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,450
- [Kendra] Who puts
ice cream on a burger?!

353
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,934
