1
00:00:00,579 --> 00:00:04,729
- Since I'm a genius, I
know how to do everything.

2
00:00:04,729 --> 00:00:06,839
(upbeat swing instrumental)

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,490
(upbeat swing instrumental)

4
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,345
- We're at the drive
through of Jack in the Box.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,817
(cheering and screaming)

6
00:00:13,817 --> 00:00:17,484
(upbeat swing instrumental)

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,870
I am so lucky I am married
to a man who is crazy enough

8
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,760
to go along with all the
crazy stuff that I wanna do.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,380
This morning, I woke up and I said Jeremy,

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,690
let's go running on the beach

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,160
with all of our children.

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,850
So, we loaded up in the car,

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,980
cause he was like, okay.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,850
Yeah, we're gonna take
turns running on the beach

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:34,650
with the big kids and walking

16
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,720
on the boardwalk with the little kids.

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,608
I'm excited.

18
00:00:37,608 --> 00:00:41,440
(playful calm guitar)

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,020
Have fun!

20
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,010
It's my turn to walk first.

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,320
Do you see a doggy?

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,183
Hey Laura, do you wanna walk by the beach?

23
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,016
- Yeah.

24
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:50,849
- [Kendra] Let's do it.

25
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:52,743
Look how cute they look!

26
00:00:52,743 --> 00:00:54,690
(light guitar instrumental)

27
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,700
And they're off.

28
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,860
Jeremy's in the lead,
oh Elise take the lead.

29
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,540
Isaac and Caleb, oh everyone's
ahead of Jeremy now!

30
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,373
(chuckles)

31
00:01:02,373 --> 00:01:03,206
- I can see em!

32
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:04,730
- There's so many people
walking their dogs

33
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,180
out along the beach that
Janae is in Heaven right now.

34
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,640
Janae doesn't say the word dog yet,

35
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,120
but she makes a specific sound

36
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,631
every time she sees a
dog, it's hard to mimic.

37
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:14,620
(low woof)

38
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,623
Maybe that?

39
00:01:15,623 --> 00:01:16,641
(chuckles)

40
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:17,700
- I see em, they're so far!

41
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,873
- [Kendra] Are they so far out there?

42
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:23,290
(light whimiscal guitar)

43
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:30,106
(upbeat funky electronic)

44
00:01:36,302 --> 00:01:37,135
- Congrats!

45
00:01:37,135 --> 00:01:40,635
(upbeat funky electronic)

46
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,453
Let's see it.

47
00:01:45,453 --> 00:01:48,864
(upbeat funky electronic)

48
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:50,380
Ooo!

49
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,420
What is that?

50
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,477
- [Jeremy] It's something.

51
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:57,768
(chill guitar instrumental)

52
00:01:57,768 --> 00:02:01,435
(chill guitar instrumental)

53
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,480
Well that was an amazing
way to start the day,

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,037
we shoulda done that more while
we were here in San Diego.

55
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:18,045
(chill guitar instrumental)

56
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:22,370
(chill guitar instrumental)

57
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,260
- [Kendra] Trying to get
the sand off, phase one.

58
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,630
So we're stopping at this
place called Kaboose,

59
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,650
I think it's called Juice Kaboose,

60
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,950
and we're gonna try acai bowls.

61
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,280
I've never had one before,

62
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,780
and I keep hearing about em everywhere.

63
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,191
So I figure we better try one.

64
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:39,420
(light playful guitar)

65
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,730
So since we've never
tried acai bowls before,

66
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,290
I decided to just go with the classic

67
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,721
and we're getting mega one
so we can all split it.

68
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:50,054
(light playful guitar instrumental)

69
00:02:56,331 --> 00:02:57,667
- Thank you.

70
00:02:57,667 --> 00:03:00,644
(mom chuckles)

71
00:03:00,644 --> 00:03:01,840
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness, thank you.

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,460
- [Elise] We get to make it?

73
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,840
- [Kendra] Yep, we're going
to assemble it at home.

74
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,620
This looks delicious, and we
are loaded up with everything,

75
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,326
we're gonna head home and eat it.

76
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:11,986
- [Jeremy] So what do you think?

77
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:12,980
- I like it.

78
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,690
- [Jeremy] You gotta mix it all up.

79
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,360
- Well we're home and doing
all of our normal daily stuff,

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,920
we're doing chores, we're
unloading the dishwasher,

81
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,420
we're folding laundry,

82
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,230
we're trying to keep
Janae occupied and safe,

83
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,890
and anyway, the kids are doing
their math and their grammar

84
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,140
and their spelling and their reading

85
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,370
and their handwriting, and blah,
blah, blah, all that stuff.

86
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,610
Jeremy is actually outside right now,

87
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,830
he's on a conference call,

88
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,020
and it's interesting cause he does these

89
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,320
conference calls outside so that the noise

90
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,400
of the kids and the chaos all stays inside

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,540
and he's outside, but I think he likes it,

92
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,750
I mean who wouldn't like
to do conference calls

93
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,583
outside, right?

94
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,000
How are you?

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,376
Did you find a fun place to walk?

96
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,209
(baby squeal)

97
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,900
- I learned how to find
the area of a triangle.

98
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,090
- [Kendra] Nice, how do you do it?

99
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,760
- Base times height divided by two.

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,593
- That makes sense.

101
00:03:58,593 --> 00:04:00,240
So I left the kids answer keys

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
for their math cirriculum at home,

103
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,720
and that hasn't been a big problem, like,

104
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,480
I just know how to do, you
know addition and subtration,

105
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,460
so I just check it,

106
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,830
but Isaac's getting up
into a higher level math,

107
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,780
and so it's taking me a long time,

108
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,810
and it just dawned on me,
I can use a calculator.

109
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,390
He can't use the
calculator to do the work,

110
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,140
but I can use the calculator
to check the work.

111
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,731
Now I don't have to do my
own math work every day.

112
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:21,564
(chime)

113
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:23,580
- Little babies went behind.

114
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,110
- Little babies went behind.

115
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,100
- [Kendra] Have fun.

116
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,933
- Thank you.

117
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:33,530
- So the kids and I are
having a friendly competition.

118
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,920
They're reading a chapter of this book

119
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,630
about tide pool creatures

120
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,120
and then I try to quiz
them and stump them,

121
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,370
and it's them versus me in
like a, little competition.

122
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,710
We're having fun with it.

123
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,660
- And other animals with shells.

124
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,200
To drill holes into the
shells of their pray.

125
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,315
- [Kendra] Did you guys win?

126
00:04:51,315 --> 00:04:53,780
(loud cheering)

127
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,990
What is that?

128
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,920
- It's a corn man.

129
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,810
- [Kendra] A giant corn on the cob man?

130
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,000
And which one did you get Lise?

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,320
- I'm a pirate, but I'm glad I can trade.

132
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,150
- I got, oh that guy.

133
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,570
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness.

134
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,400
- So last time we came to Lego Land,

135
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,630
they were doing a promotion

136
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,860
where they were giving away free tickets

137
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,560
for the month of February for one day,

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,020
so we signed up and got those

139
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,090
and this time we came prepared.

140
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,390
The kids all have their little
tradeable lego figurines.

141
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,750
And the headless wonder.

142
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,210
- We didn't know about
this last time we came,

143
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,890
but you can trade the little mini figures

144
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:25,200
all around the park.

145
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,869
(upbeat playful electronic)

146
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:31,131
- [Jeremy] They have a girl face for you.

147
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,277
- [Isaac] Oh I want to do the farmer.

148
00:05:33,277 --> 00:05:36,944
(upbeat playful electronic)

149
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,620
- So this rollercoaster is
a perfect size for Caleb,

150
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,980
and it was closed last time,

151
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,690
so he's gonna get to try it this time.

152
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,242
Laura's tall enough!

153
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:47,654
- [Elise] Yay!

154
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,821
(exciting rock metal)

155
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,899
- [Jeremy] Here we go!

156
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:58,649
(loud screaming)

157
00:06:00,448 --> 00:06:01,519
Here we go!

158
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,877
(loud screaming)

159
00:06:02,877 --> 00:06:03,710
Whoo hoo!

160
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,981
There's mom!

161
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:07,814
(screaming)

162
00:06:07,814 --> 00:06:09,116
Laura what'd you think?

163
00:06:09,116 --> 00:06:10,423
- I liked it!

164
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:11,800
My face was afraid.

165
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,980
- [Jeremy] Your face was afraid.

166
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,750
- Yeah, but I liked it, but
I was a little bit afraid.

167
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,691
- [Jeremy] A little bit
afraid, just a tincy-weency?

168
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:20,524
- Yeah.

169
00:06:20,524 --> 00:06:21,610
- [Jeremy] I was so proud of you.

170
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:22,443
- Yeah.

171
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:23,729
- [Jeremy] Laura, should
we go do it again.

172
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:24,792
- No.

173
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:25,625
- [Kendra] Bye guys!

174
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,458
- Bye!

175
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,160
- [Kendra] Drive safe,
have fun on the safari!

176
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,710
- [Jeremy] There's the giraffe.

177
00:06:32,817 --> 00:06:33,658
(loud scream)

178
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:34,716
- Go, go, go!

179
00:06:34,716 --> 00:06:35,710
- Is that a, what was it?

180
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,030
- A alligator.

181
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,475
We're going, I think there's a bear.

182
00:06:39,475 --> 00:06:41,045
- [Jeremy] Tunnel!

183
00:06:41,045 --> 00:06:42,700
(birds chirping)
(monkeys howling)

184
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,160
- [Kendra] So are you gonna drive?

185
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,993
- Yep.

186
00:06:44,993 --> 00:06:46,239
- [Kendra] You're gonna drive me?

187
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,072
- Yep.

188
00:06:48,847 --> 00:06:51,530
- [Kendra] Whoa, you're going fast!

189
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,750
Oh no, I do not like crocodiles.

190
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:56,967
- They're just made out of legos,

191
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,634
but they make noise.

192
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,669
Since I'm a genius,

193
00:07:02,575 --> 00:07:04,200
I know how to do everything.

194
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,033
- You do?

195
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,284
Does that include driving?

196
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:09,117
- Yeah.

197
00:07:09,117 --> 00:07:09,950
- [Kendra] How old are you?

198
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,783
- Four.

199
00:07:10,783 --> 00:07:11,807
- [Kendra] And you can drive?

200
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:12,640
- Mhmm.

201
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,473
- [Kendra] Wow.

202
00:07:13,473 --> 00:07:14,970
- [Jeremy] There it does Laura!

203
00:07:16,225 --> 00:07:18,175
(giggling)

204
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:21,620
(horse hooves clapping)

205
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,770
- She likes the horses.

206
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,022
What's going on?

207
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,733
(indistinct yelling)

208
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,227
- [Jeremy] You ready to drive?

209
00:07:36,227 --> 00:07:37,060
- Yeah!

210
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,314
(playful rhythmic instrumental)

211
00:07:40,314 --> 00:07:44,314
(playful rhythmic instrumental)

212
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,320
(excited squealing)

213
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,895
- [Jeremy] What are you so excited about?

214
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:57,877
- I get to do the

215
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,780
(indistinct)

216
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,670
- So Caleb turns six
in just a couple days,

217
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,445
and they said he could
drive on the senior driver.

218
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:05,278
- [Employee] Alright.

219
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,616
- [Jeremy] You excited?

220
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,076
- Yeah.

221
00:08:08,076 --> 00:08:09,325
- [Employee] Give me a nice smile.

222
00:08:09,325 --> 00:08:12,135
Give me thumbs up.

223
00:08:12,135 --> 00:08:14,078
Give me a thumbs up gorgeous.

224
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:15,904
(Jeremy chuckles)

225
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:17,817
(upbeat rhythmic instrumental)

226
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,748
- [Jeremy] He's goin'!

227
00:08:19,748 --> 00:08:21,193
- [Employee] Stay in your lane!

228
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:22,840
(upbeat rhythmic instrumental)

229
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,381
(upbeat rhythmic instrumental)

230
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,214
- Hello.

231
00:08:28,214 --> 00:08:29,108
- [Jeremy] Hello.

232
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:31,272
(upbeat rhythmic instrumental)

233
00:08:31,272 --> 00:08:35,189
(upbeat rhythmic instrumental)

234
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,265
(electronic computer techno)

235
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:49,015
(electronic computer techno)

236
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,280
(giggling)

237
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:01,244
- I'm glad I didn't bring flip flops!

238
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:07,425
(scream)

239
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,293
(scream)

240
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:10,710
(scream)

241
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,121
- [Jeremy] Did you have any fun?

242
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:13,062
- Yeah!

243
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:15,839
(rhythmic drum instrumental)

244
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
(rhythmic drum instrumental)

245
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,850
- So this next ride is just a robotic arm

246
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,800
that flips around.

247
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,092
You can pick which level it's gonna be on

248
00:09:23,092 --> 00:09:24,591
and Isaac and Elise wanna try it.

249
00:09:24,591 --> 00:09:26,580
- I only wanna do level three.

250
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,240
- I wanna do level five.

251
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,480
- Isaac, take care of mom and the kids.

252
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,378
Uh oh, whoa!

253
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:34,378
Uh oh, whoa!

254
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:37,751
(hip electronic beat)

255
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:40,918
(hip electronic beat)

256
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:46,829
(hip electronic beat)

257
00:09:52,644 --> 00:09:54,820
(squeal)

258
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,300
Come have apple or fries!

259
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:58,785
Come on!

260
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:00,522
You did it, come on!

261
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,840
(upbeat hip electronic)

262
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,800
- So this ride is like a race

263
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,180
with fire trucks and police cars,

264
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,996
and they're going up and
trying to put out fires

265
00:10:07,996 --> 00:10:08,940
so it looks fun.

266
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,215
(alarm bell)

267
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:12,482
(upbeat hip electronic)

268
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:15,815
(upbeat hip electronic)

269
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,200
- Well I'm amazed how much we got in.

270
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,360
In just two and a half
hours that we were here.

271
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,240
It was a lot of fun.

272
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,750
Normally when we go to amusement parks,

273
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,010
we have a grandparent, or
somebody else to help us out.

274
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,610
But we were able to do it
with just Kendra and I,

275
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,624
which was also a big success.

276
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:41,957
(calming guitar melody)

277
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,600
We're at the drive thru of Jack in Box.

278
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,970
My mom used to take me
here when I was little

279
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,390
to get their tacos, and so
it's a nostalgic place for me,

280
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:52,570
and there's none that are
really close to where we live

281
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,812
in Kansas City, so.

282
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:56,080
- [Kendra] This is a
must hit spot for Jeremy.

283
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,330
- [Laura] Goodnight, J House out.

284
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,825
- [Jeremy] It's gonna be little loud.

285
00:11:00,825 --> 00:11:02,040
(rumbling and rattling)

286
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,873
- [Kendra] Whoa!

287
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,610
(playful clapping beat)

288
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,443
- Oh wow!

289
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,389
- [Kendra] Yeah, show
us your best fish face.

290
00:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,460
(playful clapping beat)

291
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,986
- It looks like a castle
and you can go in it!

292
00:11:15,986 --> 00:00:00,000
(playful clapping beat)
