1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:02,076
- [Kendra] All right,
what are you thinking?

2
00:00:02,076 --> 00:00:04,041
- It was such a big surprise.

3
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:07,359
Like I thought it was some
kind of toy or something.

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:09,674
And now I'm so surprised.

5
00:00:09,674 --> 00:00:11,366
(Kendra laughs)

6
00:00:11,366 --> 00:00:14,616
(fun, energetic music)

7
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:40,102
- [Kendra] So Isaac and
Elise are making cards

8
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:41,802
for the families that we deliver

9
00:00:41,802 --> 00:00:43,754
Meals on Wheels meals for.

10
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:46,142
- Kendra, there's a toy in the toaster.

11
00:00:46,142 --> 00:00:47,861
Look at that.
- It's my toy.

12
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,812
- No, it's mine.
- It's melted, it's like--

13
00:00:49,812 --> 00:00:51,680
- [Kendra] I wonder who did that.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,236
- Probably Caleb.
- I wonder who did that.

15
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:57,153
- Oh, it was me, maybe.

16
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:00,133
It was me maybe.

17
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:02,883
- We have a little over two hours

18
00:01:04,034 --> 00:01:05,996
to deliver Meals on Wheels,

19
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:07,967
have Jeremy and I both
shower and get ready,

20
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,634
and get this entire house ready.

21
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:15,605
- Check it out.

22
00:01:19,755 --> 00:01:23,922
(Elmo talking and laughing in background)

23
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:29,003
They don't know about this.
- Done.

24
00:01:32,638 --> 00:01:35,013
- [Kendra] Laura is a climber.

25
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:35,988
(Laura squeals)

26
00:01:35,988 --> 00:01:39,085
We got another climber, yay!

27
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:41,210
Trying and trying and trying to get up

28
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,293
onto this fireplace nook.

29
00:01:44,975 --> 00:01:46,130
Did you do it?

30
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:48,292
- [Elise] Her try to get down.

31
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:51,709
(gentle music box music)

32
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:55,117
- [Jeremy] Come on, come on.

33
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,161
(Caleb grunts)

34
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,435
All right, can I take a turn?

35
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,567
- [Caleb] No, not yet,
because I want to do this.

36
00:02:04,567 --> 00:02:05,400
- Okay.

37
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,639
So, today I was talking to Kendra,

38
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,819
and we're trying to
get the house all clean

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,487
for our exciting surprise today.

40
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,112
And I was like, "Maybe we shoulda just

41
00:02:15,112 --> 00:02:16,893
"got a substitute today
for Meals on Wheels."

42
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:18,033
But I'm really we didn't.

43
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:20,438
It was fun for the kids to get to

44
00:02:20,438 --> 00:02:21,792
see the people that we see every week,

45
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:23,275
give them Christmas cards,

46
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:26,058
and now shovel the walkway.

47
00:02:26,058 --> 00:02:27,815
So our house might be
a little bit messier,

48
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,456
but I'd rather have a messier house.

49
00:02:30,456 --> 00:02:31,706
- I felt happy.

50
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:35,535
- [Jeremy] What, you felt happy?

51
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:36,439
- Mm-Hmm.

52
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:38,939
- [Jeremy] Why were you happy?

53
00:02:46,411 --> 00:02:49,448
- Yep, yeah we visit every week,

54
00:02:49,448 --> 00:02:52,005
this wonderful woman
who's older and alone,

55
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,211
and her health is continuing to decline.

56
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:56,527
And I think you guys really made her day.

57
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:58,417
- So we're cleaning up,
and we're down to the wire.

58
00:02:58,417 --> 00:03:01,273
We only have about 15, 20 minutes left.

59
00:03:01,273 --> 00:03:03,995
So I go to check on him,
he's supposed to be napping.

60
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:05,892
But I hear a funny sound.

61
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:07,531
- [Jeremy] I'm nervous.

62
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:10,281
(Caleb laughing)

63
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,870
- [Kendra] Triple
antibiotic ointment tube,

64
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,203
completely squeezed all over the window,

65
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:20,544
and everywhere else.

66
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:24,740
- [Caleb] Mm-Hmm, and
now I'm putting a book.

67
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,008
- Is it on the carpet?

68
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:29,433
- [Kendra] Oh, now he's
trying to put a book on it.

69
00:03:29,433 --> 00:03:31,839
Anyway, and this is why--

70
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,867
- [Jeremy] Don't touch it anymore, Buddy.

71
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:34,553
- Nothing can be in his
room, except for his bed.

72
00:03:34,553 --> 00:03:35,386
We forgot.

73
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:38,605
Laura and I are on our way to the airport

74
00:03:38,605 --> 00:03:40,445
to pick up my Mom and Dad.

75
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:41,928
And I'm super excited.

76
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:43,756
The kids don't know that they're coming,

77
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:47,008
and it's gonna be just really exciting.

78
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:49,271
We don't get to see them very much,

79
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,714
'cause they live so far away,

80
00:03:50,714 --> 00:03:52,493
so this is gonna be quite the treat.

81
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:55,609
And it's actually super nostalgic for me,

82
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:57,317
because when I was young,

83
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:00,607
I think somewhere between
the age of four and six,

84
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:02,278
my grandparents, my Dad's parents,

85
00:04:02,278 --> 00:04:05,192
surprised us the same way.

86
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,442
(Kendra laughs)

87
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:09,754
- Hey, hi Dad.
(Dad laughing)

88
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:10,587
Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,519
All right, close your eyes.

90
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,835
Here comes the surprise.

91
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:16,668
Ready?

92
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:19,668
And you can open in three, two, one.

93
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:25,046
- Merry Christmas
- Guys, Merry Christmas!

94
00:04:25,046 --> 00:04:26,406
- Hello.

95
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:28,635
- [Kendra] They don't know what to do.

96
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,226
- Elise!
- Grandpa!

97
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,226
- Yay!
- Hi guys, hi, hi!

98
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:35,730
- We came to see you.

99
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,782
- [Grandma] Did you know we were coming?

100
00:04:37,782 --> 00:04:39,549
Did you think we were coming?

101
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:43,507
Elise, our glasses are matching. (laughs)

102
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:44,739
Are you surprised?

103
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:45,653
- [Elise] Yeah.

104
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,649
- Did you know we were coming?

105
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:47,624
- [Papa] You are so big.

106
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:48,464
- No, you didn't know that?

107
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,236
We get to have our matching
glasses, look at that.

108
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:52,050
- [Papa] Caleb.

109
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,548
- [Caleb] You can play tickle monster.

110
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:55,945
- [Papa] Yes, we're gonna
play tickle monster.

111
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,612
- What do you think?

112
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:01,548
- (laughs) I thought it was gonna be

113
00:05:01,548 --> 00:05:03,782
some like toy or something.

114
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:05,592
- Aw, it's way better than a toy.

115
00:05:05,592 --> 00:05:08,091
(Papa laughs)

116
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:10,805
- Clean the floor, whee.

117
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:12,723
- Can we play tickle monster?

118
00:05:12,723 --> 00:05:15,811
(Papa growls)
(everyone laughing)

119
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:18,144
- A little bit harder, oh...

120
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:22,065
- I don't know why the kids
like it when Papa comes.

121
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:23,056
(Papa laughing)

122
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,988
He's like a human gymnasium.

123
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:26,909
So I made dinner, and I'm cleaning it up.

124
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,787
Jeremy is putting Laura down for a nap.

125
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,513
My Dad is doing math with Isaac.

126
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,415
My Mom is reading with Elise,

127
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:34,101
and Caleb's just running around.

128
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:36,900
Apparently all I need is four adults.

129
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,093
All day.

130
00:05:38,093 --> 00:05:39,477
And then I could be like sane,

131
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:41,194
and get stuff done. (sings)

132
00:05:41,194 --> 00:05:43,784
- How would you count by threes?

133
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,909
- Well, three, six, nine.
- A boy party.

134
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,875
- Perfect.
- 12, 15,

135
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,042
- What was that?
- 18, 21,

136
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,276
24, 27.

137
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,761
- [Papa] And so every time you have two--

138
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:59,020
- [Grandma] And I love you, and.

139
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,936
There you go.

140
00:05:59,936 --> 00:06:01,212
- So my Dad is Mr. Fixit,

141
00:06:01,212 --> 00:06:02,503
and every time he comes to visit,

142
00:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,321
I conveniently have a few things

143
00:06:04,321 --> 00:06:06,654
that maybe he could look at.

144
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,010
So he's fixing a towel rack.

145
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,042
- Yes, that's right.

146
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:12,956
- Apparently there's some sort of

147
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,568
an indoor snowball fight going on.

148
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:17,269
(Papa laughs)
(kids scream and laugh)

149
00:06:17,269 --> 00:06:18,102
These are bean bags.

150
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:19,102
- [Papa] No!

151
00:06:20,427 --> 00:06:22,008
(screaming and laughing)

152
00:06:22,008 --> 00:06:24,334
- [Jeremy] Caleb, no, oh.

153
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:26,984
- [Kendra] Incoming, incoming. (screams)

154
00:06:26,984 --> 00:06:30,583
(everyone laughs)

155
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,500
- Holy cow.

156
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,804
There's four.

157
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,186
There's five.

158
00:06:37,186 --> 00:06:38,514
There's six.

159
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:39,978
There's seven.

160
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:41,624
There's eight.

161
00:06:41,624 --> 00:06:46,062
Yay (claps) a new world record!

162
00:06:46,062 --> 00:06:48,988
Isaac has just done
eight bean bags in a row.

163
00:06:48,988 --> 00:06:50,178
How do you feel Buddy?

164
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:51,011
- Happy.

165
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:54,583
- Wow, we're excited as well.

166
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,837
Back to our regular scheduled programming.

167
00:06:56,837 --> 00:06:58,742
- [Caleb] How about you blow up a bed?

168
00:06:58,742 --> 00:06:59,950
- That's a great idea.

169
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,846
Why don't we do the blowup bed?

170
00:07:01,846 --> 00:07:03,270
- Okay say, "Goodnight Papa."

171
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,582
- Goodnight Papa.
- Thank you.

172
00:07:04,582 --> 00:07:06,337
That's a great idea.

173
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:07,804
- Say goodnight.
- Love you Cubby.

174
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:08,637
- Goodnight.

175
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:09,470
- Say J House out.

176
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,820
- J House out, bye.

177
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,737
(fun active music)

178
00:07:14,954 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] Ooh, nice snow angel Lisey.
