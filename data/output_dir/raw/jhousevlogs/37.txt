1
00:00:00,287 --> 00:00:01,315
(crowd talking)

2
00:00:01,315 --> 00:00:03,519
(Elise shrieks)

3
00:00:03,519 --> 00:00:06,186
(lively techno)

4
00:00:13,309 --> 00:00:18,309
(Janae yells happily)
(Elise shouts happily)

00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:24,885
("Cosmic Messages (UFO
Remix)" by DJoNemesis & Lilly)

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,566
- So after the bike ride we
picked up some Mexican food,

7
00:00:53,566 --> 00:00:57,058
and we're heading home to devour it.

8
00:00:57,058 --> 00:00:58,324
- [Kendra] Hey Caleb, come here, buddy!

9
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,438
I just checked the mail,
and look what you got.

10
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:03,047
- Yay!
- [Jeremy] Who's it from?

11
00:01:03,047 --> 00:01:05,428
- Luke.
- [Jeremy] Cousin Luke.

12
00:01:05,428 --> 00:01:06,890
- The kids had some of there cousins

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,435
write them letters while they're here.

14
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,906
They have a really good breakfast burrito.

15
00:01:09,906 --> 00:01:12,081
- This is so good, the California burrito.

16
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:15,140
- [Jeremy] Here's the
carne asada soft taco.

17
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,680
- So when I was researching
fun stuff to do in San Diego

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,063
before our trip, I knew
that San Diego had a zoo.

19
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:22,097
I mean, I think everybody
knows that San Diego had a zoo,

20
00:01:22,097 --> 00:01:24,486
but I had no idea that they
also have a safari park.

21
00:01:24,486 --> 00:01:26,335
And our family has never
been to a safari park,

22
00:01:26,335 --> 00:01:27,836
so that's where we're headed today.

23
00:01:27,836 --> 00:01:31,253
(playful bongo drumming)

24
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:37,955
- So when we went to the San Diego Zoo,

25
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:40,132
there was one animal that
Isaac really wanted to see

26
00:01:40,132 --> 00:01:42,622
that we didn't see.
- A giraffe.

27
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:44,682
- [Jeremy] So we're hoping
today to make that right.

28
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:48,849
(lighthearted instrumental music)

29
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:56,404
- [Jeremy] There's the giraffe.

30
00:01:56,404 --> 00:02:00,571
(lighthearted instrumental music)

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,549
- I kind of feel like we're
entering Jurassic Park.

32
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,716
(lighthearted instrumental music)

33
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,112
- [Kendra] We found a log.

34
00:02:17,112 --> 00:02:19,844
- [Caleb] Is this a real log?
- [Kendra] What do you think?

35
00:02:19,844 --> 00:02:22,642
- [Caleb] Yeah.
- [Kendra] You think so?

36
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,954
Feels awful smooth and shiny to be real.

37
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:26,601
This place is beautiful.

38
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:28,318
(acoustic guitar music)

39
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,534
- [Kendra] We're exploring
in the Tiger Trail.

40
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:33,867
(acoustic guitar music)

41
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,251
- [Kendra] Do you guys see the tiger?

42
00:02:36,251 --> 00:02:37,346
- I thought it was something in the water,

43
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:40,152
and why do they have
water? Can tigers swim?

44
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:41,665
- [Kendra] Probably.

45
00:02:41,665 --> 00:02:43,383
I'm sure he can jump high. There he is!

46
00:02:43,383 --> 00:02:47,162
There's the tiger!
- [Caleb] Hey! Hey!

47
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:49,002
- Back in the Tiger Trail
there's a really nice

48
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,516
shaded play area, and we're
crashing here for a few minutes.

49
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:54,111
- [Kendra] Looking in there, Laura?

50
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:56,316
Climb up!
- There's people under!

51
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:59,741
- [Kendra] There's people under?

52
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,538
That one's kinda slippery, buddy.

53
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:06,038
Hey (chuckles) do you like that area?

54
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:08,132
Teaching her how to climb?

55
00:03:08,132 --> 00:03:09,035
- Yeah.

56
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:11,157
- [Kendra] She's trying. She wants to.

57
00:03:11,157 --> 00:03:13,658
This park is so well-shaded,
at least the tiger area was,

58
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:16,015
and I love that because I
hate being all hot and sweaty

59
00:03:16,015 --> 00:03:17,133
at a park, I mean, a zoo.

60
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:18,827
So while we're here at the safari park,

61
00:03:18,827 --> 00:03:20,918
the little kids and I are
doing a wildlife workshop

62
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,456
where we get to meet some of the animals.

63
00:03:22,456 --> 00:03:25,930
- Geronimo is an armadillo.
So let me show you his back.

64
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,515
So see here, he's got
one, two, three bands.

65
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:30,815
And these bands back here,

66
00:03:30,815 --> 00:03:32,229
they help him to roll into his ball.

67
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:33,610
And you know when he likes
to roll into his ball?

68
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,935
When he's scared of an
animal coming after him

69
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:37,714
that's gonna eat him, called a predator.

70
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:39,064
Geronimo, you're gonna be surprised

71
00:03:39,064 --> 00:03:40,579
when I tell you how old he is.

72
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:43,383
He is 18 years old.
- Whoa.

73
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,435
- [Armadillo Instructor] He's
kind of an older armadillo.

74
00:03:45,435 --> 00:03:46,654
- A little small.

75
00:03:46,654 --> 00:03:49,072
Like a cat with a shell.
(armadillo instructor laughs)

76
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:51,098
- [Kendra] He looks like
an armored rat, to me.

77
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,424
What do you think of that?

78
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,555
- So we, of course, wanna be
really soft and nice to him.

79
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:56,081
Good job!

80
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,147
- [Kendra] What is that, Laura?

81
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:58,041
- Bug soup

82
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,942
- [Kendra] This is bug soup.

83
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:01,648
- We're going on the safari.

84
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:03,398
- [Jeremy] Yep, the caravan safari.

85
00:04:03,398 --> 00:04:04,827
Are you gonna take some pictures, too?

86
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,752
- [Elise] Yeah.

87
00:04:05,752 --> 00:04:07,175
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna feed a giraffe?

88
00:04:07,175 --> 00:04:10,008
(tribal drumming)

89
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,103
- I took a picture of a giraffe.

90
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:27,936
(tribal drumming)

91
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:33,132
- Can I feed it?

92
00:04:33,132 --> 00:04:35,175
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you can feed it.

93
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,850
- Okay, so I'm not touching her,

94
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,270
but notice that the leaves,

95
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,112
she wants to come into the leaves,

96
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:43,668
but we don't feed her in here,
we feed her right here, okay?

97
00:04:43,668 --> 00:04:45,699
I'm reinforcing positive behavior.

98
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:48,023
- [Giraffe Instructor] Hide
it from her, and then one leaf

99
00:04:48,023 --> 00:04:49,792
at a time, as high as you can, reach up

100
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:53,916
like you're asking the teacher a question.

101
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,170
(Jeremy laughs)

102
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,052
- [Jeremy] Can you feel her tongue?

103
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,587
- Yeah.

104
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:02,838
(Jeremy laughs)

105
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,082
- [Giraffe Instructor] Perfect!
And see how well he did?

106
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:07,622
He did not feed her when
her head was inside.

107
00:05:07,622 --> 00:05:11,107
(Jeremy and Isaac laugh)

108
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:12,326
- Okay, I don't have any more.

109
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:13,911
(crowd laughs)

110
00:05:13,911 --> 00:05:15,402
- [Jeremy] Good job, buddy!

111
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:17,740
- It felt kind of sticky
but I really liked it.

112
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,426
- [Jeremy] Yeah, they said
their slime is like hair gel.

113
00:05:19,426 --> 00:05:20,259
- Yeah.

114
00:05:25,005 --> 00:05:26,497
- [Jeremy] So lift it up high.

115
00:05:26,497 --> 00:05:27,817
Pick one out and lift it up high.

116
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:30,468
(Elise shrieks)
(crowd laughs)

117
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:33,193
- [Jeremy] So lift it up
high, just one at a time.

118
00:05:33,193 --> 00:05:34,860
Hide the other ones.

119
00:05:35,753 --> 00:05:40,753
(Elise shrieks)
(Jeremy laughs)

120
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,241
- [Jeremy] Oh, and then
hold the other one up high.

121
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:49,171
So hold it up high, high above your head.

122
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,838
You were very brave.

123
00:05:53,601 --> 00:05:55,382
- He looks like a porcupine, huh?

124
00:05:55,382 --> 00:05:58,154
What other guesses do you
guys think he might be?

125
00:05:58,154 --> 00:06:00,125
- [Kendra] So it's not a porcupine.

126
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,593
- [Echidna Instructor] Not a
porcupine. He's kinda tricky.

127
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:06,789
He has a really funny name.
He's called an echidna.

128
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:07,898
- [Kendra] Whoa!

129
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,887
- Can you guys say that?
- Echidna

130
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:11,433
- [Kendra] Echidna, can you say it?

131
00:06:11,433 --> 00:06:12,467
- "N-kih-nuh"

132
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:13,554
- [Kendra] Echidna, how 'bout you?

133
00:06:13,554 --> 00:06:16,185
Can you say "echidna"? No.

134
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,628
- [Echidna Instructor] His name is Chinby,

135
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,985
and he likes bugs just like Geronimo.

136
00:06:19,985 --> 00:06:21,417
- [Kendra] Do you see
how long his tongue is?

137
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:22,911
- [Caleb] How does he eat it?

138
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:25,555
- [Echidna Instructor] He slips
it all up with his tongue.

139
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:28,143
Good job, guys! Not too bad, huh?

140
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:29,728
- [Kendra] So gentle!

141
00:06:29,728 --> 00:06:31,821
- [Echidna Instructor] So he's
not related to porcupines.

142
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:34,878
We take really good care of
our animals at the safari park.

143
00:06:34,878 --> 00:06:36,391
- He's a sleepy one right now.

144
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,892
- [Kendra] Oh! Oh my goodness!

145
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:41,126
- [Caleb] You're holding him like a baby!

146
00:06:41,126 --> 00:06:42,690
- [Kendra] Janae's so excited.

147
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,836
- [Anteater Instructor] So
this is an anteater, you guys.

148
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:48,026
His name is Fernando,
Fernando the anteater.

149
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:50,188
This one's humongous.
He stays on the ground.

150
00:06:50,188 --> 00:06:52,078
He's quite a big anteater.

151
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:52,911
Look what he's doing to my arm!

152
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,437
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness.
It's wrapping around.

153
00:06:54,437 --> 00:06:57,310
- Look what happens when
I hang him like this.

154
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,638
His tail holds onto my arm

155
00:06:59,638 --> 00:07:01,800
the way it would hold onto branches.

156
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,665
'Cause he climbs around up in
the trees in the rainforest.

157
00:07:04,665 --> 00:07:06,413
(laughing)

158
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:08,923
So he's still really young, you guys,

159
00:07:08,923 --> 00:07:10,731
'cause he's kinda like
a teenager anteater.

160
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:12,316
He's a year and a half old.

161
00:07:12,316 --> 00:07:13,381
- [Kendra] He's a messy eater.

162
00:07:13,381 --> 00:07:15,242
- [Anteater Instructor]
Look at this picture.

163
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:16,380
- [Kendra] Whoa, look at this!

164
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,883
- [Anteater Instructor]
That's how long the tongue is!

165
00:07:17,883 --> 00:07:19,781
- [Kendra] So soft, good job, Miss Laura.

166
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:21,540
Does he feel like a dog or a cat?

167
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,836
Does he feel similar to that or different?

168
00:07:23,836 --> 00:07:27,656
- I would say he feels
a lot the same as a dog.

169
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:28,875
- [Anteater Instructor] The
other great thing he does

170
00:07:28,875 --> 00:07:32,471
is dig up the ants. He'll eat
other bugs too, like termites.

171
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:33,902
- Laura just asked the cutest question.

172
00:07:33,902 --> 00:07:36,088
She said, "Does he have
a mommy or a daddy?"

173
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,802
He does, huh? All animals have mommies

174
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:39,783
and daddies, Miss Laura.

175
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:40,616
Hi.

176
00:07:41,623 --> 00:07:43,686
So Janae didn't really know
what to do with the armadillo

177
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:46,113
or the echidna. She kinda
like just looked at 'em,

178
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:48,612
but then the anteater came
out and she said "dog"

179
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:52,137
and she's lookin' and waving
and she's very excited.

180
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:55,304
(uplifting soft rock)

181
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:22,908
- [Jeremy] That's gonna be a good picture.

182
00:08:22,908 --> 00:08:24,523
Did you hear the name of that rhino?

183
00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:26,902
It's Rhinoceros Unicornis.

184
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:28,893
- Yeah, that's its scientific name

185
00:08:28,893 --> 00:08:31,310
because it only has one horn.

186
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:34,255
- [Rhino Instructor] Wanna try?

187
00:08:34,256 --> 00:08:36,360
- [Jeremy Laughs] Elise just tossed it in.

188
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,107
- [Elise] Dad, it's horn is like wood.

189
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:39,216
- [Jeremy] So they said
that most of the time

190
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,480
when they do this tour
that they aren't able

191
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,857
to feed the rhinos so we got really lucky.

192
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,026
So as they were driving us around

193
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,181
they were talking and educating us about

194
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,739
so many aspects of the animal's life.

195
00:08:49,739 --> 00:08:53,600
Their habitat, them going
back into the wild and mating.

196
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,604
It was just super
interesting and informative.

197
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,890
- I'm so excited.

198
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,042
- [Kendra] What are you excited about?

199
00:09:00,042 --> 00:09:01,502
- The cheetah run.

200
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,484
- [Kendra] The cheetah run.
How fast is it gonna go?

201
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:05,712
- 70 miles an hour

202
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:09,390
- [Announcer] So let's
give it up for Rillo!

203
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,720
- So before they have the cheetah run,

204
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,176
they have a dog run to
help the cheetah out.

205
00:09:14,176 --> 00:09:17,759
- [Announcer] Everyone,
enjoy Bayati's run.

206
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,666
(crowd cheers)

207
00:09:22,953 --> 00:09:25,870
Bayati just ran our 100 meter track

208
00:09:27,203 --> 00:09:28,536
in 5.02 seconds.

209
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,469
Yeah!

210
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:52,639
(whistle blows)

211
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,639
Fantastic! 5.13 seconds.

(acoustic guitar music)

213
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:07,256
- [Kendra] Look at that
baby on its mommy's back.

214
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:09,848
- [Jeremy] It's just like
you're being held by your mama.

(acoustic guitar music)

216
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:31,698
- Whole question trivia. What do you call

217
00:10:31,698 --> 00:10:36,698
a, for a better word, flock
of flamingos? It's not flock.

218
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,564
- Herd?

219
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:39,672
- [Jeremy] Is it a herd?

220
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:40,505
- (boy) No.

221
00:10:40,505 --> 00:10:41,764
- Is it a "flih-fuh-negger"?

222
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:42,994
- [Jeremy] A "Flih-fuh-negger?

223
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:43,827
- (boy) Nope.

224
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:44,660
- [Kendra] Do you know the answer?

225
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,753
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

226
00:10:46,753 --> 00:10:50,207
And the answer is, a flamboyant.

227
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:52,923
- [Kendra] Look at how
skinny their little legs are.

228
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,413
No offense, flamingos.

229
00:10:54,413 --> 00:10:55,246
Here's what's funny to me.

230
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:57,266
Why do they not just
sit down in the water?

231
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,630
Look at that one right
there closest to us.

232
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,939
He's on one leg in the water.

233
00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:02,145
Why doesn't he just, like, sit down.

("Landra's Dream" by Anders Baldwin)

235
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:10,475
- [Jeremy] Tell me if you
can find the animal in here.

236
00:11:10,475 --> 00:11:11,979
- [Kendra] Is that real?

237
00:11:11,979 --> 00:11:13,359
- [Child] What is it?

238
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,192
- Found it.

239
00:11:14,192 --> 00:11:15,299
- [Jeremy] What is it?

240
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,466
- It's a frog.

241
00:11:17,749 --> 00:11:20,236
- [Kendra] It's ginormous!
It looks like a painted rock

242
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:21,630
that we would put in our front yard.

243
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,442
Are you sure that thing's real?

244
00:11:24,442 --> 00:11:25,275
- [Jeremy] Yeah. African bullfrog.

245
00:11:25,275 --> 00:11:27,196
- (gasps) I just saw it move.

246
00:11:27,196 --> 00:11:29,594
Okay, African bullfrogs are huge.

247
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:30,427
- [Child] What's in there?

248
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:32,152

peace. He's meditating.

255
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:54,440
- (laughs) That might be a
little advanced for the parrot.

256
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,914
We're really grateful that the safari park

257
00:11:55,914 --> 00:11:57,447
invited us out to come do some of these

that their head is 20%
