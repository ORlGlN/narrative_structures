1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:01,409
- [Jeremy] So how do you
feel about the dentist

2
00:00:01,409 --> 00:00:03,031
lookin' at your teeth?

3
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:04,830
- Scared.
- Gets a little bit

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,057
nervous making it looks
under construction.

5
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:09,224
- Can you open your mouth?

6
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:16,212
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:24,524
(tranquil music)

8
00:00:25,586 --> 00:00:26,786
- The leaves are falling.

9
00:00:26,786 --> 00:00:28,303
- [Jeremy] You see the
leaves falling out there?

10
00:00:28,303 --> 00:00:29,568
- Yeah.

11
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:30,625
- [Jeremy] Crazy huh?

12
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,125
- Yeah 'cause it's

13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,543
winter!

14
00:00:34,543 --> 00:00:36,118
- [Jeremy] Almost, it's fall.

15
00:00:36,118 --> 00:00:36,959
- Fall!

16
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:39,334
- We're excited to have Osmo
sponsoring our video today.

17
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:41,341
And we're even more excited to share Osmo

18
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,330
with our kids,

19
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,201
Here it is.

20
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:45,597
So this guy is called Mo the Monster.

21
00:00:45,597 --> 00:00:47,079
He's a fuzzy, orange creature.

22
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,135
- Is he gonna eat me?

23
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,949
- He's not gonna eat you.

24
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,342
This is a game.

25
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:53,411
Let's see what's inside.

26
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:55,460
- That's the eraser?
- Yep.

27
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,501
It's also a bag.
- Cool.

28
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:58,536
- You guys wanna go check it out?

29
00:00:58,536 --> 00:00:59,369
- [Together] Yeah!

30
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:00,202
- Should we set it up at the table?

31
00:01:00,202 --> 00:01:01,057
- [Kids] Yeah!

32
00:01:01,057 --> 00:01:02,412
- And you set it up

33
00:01:02,412 --> 00:01:03,829
and it works with

34
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,903
iPads, or iPhones.

35
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:09,486
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:13,648 --> 00:01:15,554
Click on the Osmo Monster App.

37
00:01:15,554 --> 00:01:17,971
Caleb, you wanna play for us?

38
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:23,216
- Hello new friend, I'm Mo.

39
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,846
What's your name?

40
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:25,945
- Caleb.
- Isaac.

41
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:26,782
- Elise.

42
00:01:26,782 --> 00:01:27,971
- [Mo] Pleased to meet you.

43
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:29,008
- Laura.

44
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:30,826
(laughing)

45
00:01:30,826 --> 00:01:32,778
- To land of imagination.

46
00:01:32,778 --> 00:01:33,690
(triumphant music)

47
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,029
To create something here,

48
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:37,273
you need to draw something down there.

49
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:38,897
Let's give it a try.

50
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,739
Draw a balloon.

51
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:43,938
Draw it down there, then
tap here when it's ready.

52
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:44,855
Okay.

53
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:46,365
Now to pull it in.

54
00:01:46,365 --> 00:01:49,198
Stand back and cross your fingers.

55
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:53,520
- Look!
- That's my

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,394
actual balloon.
- Ah, it worked.

57
00:01:56,394 --> 00:01:57,416
(laughing)

58
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:58,320
- It was red!

59
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,153
Oh my!

60
00:02:00,295 --> 00:02:02,415
- We can put on a magic show.

61
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,819
- The magic!
- Magic.

62
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,167
- Do you guys wanna do the magic show?

63
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:09,250
So Caleb is drawing our
stage for the magic show.

64
00:02:11,384 --> 00:02:13,398
- A magnificent stage.

65
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:16,198
(gasping)

66
00:02:16,198 --> 00:02:19,522
On with the show!
- That's your stage!

67
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:21,840
- I think I should've drawed it bigger.

68
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,120
- [Jeremy] Oh no, that's perfect.

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,172
And I love that you got
some marker on your cheek.

70
00:02:26,172 --> 00:02:27,482
- Let's do the show together.

71
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:31,315
- [Jeremy] So erase the
stage and draw a wand.

72
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:36,140
(screaming)

73
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,469
- Ha!

74
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,386
- Lets make the burger.

75
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:43,852
Perfect.

76
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:46,538
- Mm, I can't wait for later.

77
00:02:46,538 --> 00:02:48,788
(slurping)

78
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,319
This is so cool.

79
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,569
Watch this mom.

80
00:02:55,726 --> 00:02:58,478
- I'm never sure what's on the other side.

81
00:02:58,478 --> 00:02:59,869
- A cauldron!
- Let's see what's

82
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:01,286
inside this time.

83
00:03:02,806 --> 00:03:05,852
- [Jeremy] Those are your drawings buddy.

84
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,282
You drew all those things.

85
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,115
- Ta-da!

86
00:03:10,552 --> 00:03:11,385
Good show!

87
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,609
- So guys that was the magic show.

88
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:14,050
But there's actually 10 different games

89
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,580
we can play with this.

90
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,847
- Wow.
- That's cool.

91
00:03:16,847 --> 00:03:17,680
- You guys wanna try more of 'em?

92
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,513
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

93
00:03:18,513 --> 00:03:20,065
- So the Masterpiece
App has a cool feature

94
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,204
where you can take
pictures of toys or items

95
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:24,994
and then it puts it into drawing form

96
00:03:24,994 --> 00:03:25,861
so you can color it in.

97
00:03:25,861 --> 00:03:27,377
There you go.
- Wow.

98
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:30,790
(tranquil music)

99
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,676
- [Jeremy] You did amazing.

100
00:03:32,676 --> 00:03:34,205
- I love that Osmo has different games

101
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:35,196
at different levels.

102
00:03:35,196 --> 00:03:37,781
So that all my kids can enjoy it.

103
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:39,887
(upbeat music)

104
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,567
- So I wanted Isaac to
try the Newton games

105
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,053
because it combines physics
with problem solving.

106
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:45,801
So Isaac has to draw the lines

107
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,753
that will make these darts hit the balls.

108
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:49,836
There you go!

109
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:53,013
He got it!
- I love this.

110
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,838
- What does this thing do?
- It's awesome.

111
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:59,233
- [Jeremy] It's physics.

112
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,733
- It's so amazing.

113
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,729
- Thank you to Osmo for
sponsoring our video today.

114
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:07,287
If you'd like to buy Monster,

115
00:04:07,287 --> 00:04:09,367
you can get it at playosmo.com, Target,

116
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:10,900
Amazon and Best Buy.

117
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,173
And there's information at the link

118
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:13,852
in the description box below.

119
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,602
(tranquil music)

120
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,096
Well this morning, the kids are claiming

121
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,444
that they're hearing Janae saying dada.

122
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:26,505
So, she might be saying dada and mama.

123
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:27,367
I just can't believe it.

124
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,708
She's growing up so quick

125
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:30,480
and I know that's like cliche to say that

126
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,341
but I really feel like
she's growing up faster

127
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:33,218
than our other kids.

128
00:04:33,218 --> 00:04:35,598
- She's learning from our example.

129
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:36,431
- [Kendra] You think so?

130
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:38,325
You think that's why Janae
is learning so quick?

131
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:39,251
- Yeah.

132
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,106
- I think Naenae's gonna
actually be walking

133
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:44,445
about at the time when she turns one.

134
00:04:44,445 --> 00:04:45,278
- [Kendra] You think so?

135
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:48,019
- Maybe even at like 11 months.

136
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:50,853
- Maybe just one more
month, she could do it.

137
00:04:50,853 --> 00:04:51,686
- Poll question.

138
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:54,059
When will Janae start walking?

139
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:55,545
- [Elise] Right now she's--
- So we'll do like--

140
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,080
at eight months.
- You know.

141
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,453
Nine months, 10 months,
11 months, 12 months.

142
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:01,589
- Now important data for this question.

143
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:03,475
All of our kids have been late walkers.

144
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:05,095
Laura was our earliest walker

145
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,973
and I think she was 14 months old.

146
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,985
Correct me if I'm wrong.

147
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,348
We do have videos of that.

148
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,496
But Caleb was 15 months
and Isaac and Elise

149
00:05:12,496 --> 00:05:14,143
were both 16 or 17 months.

150
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,316
So this is way early for our family.

151
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,010
Well now we're on our way to the dentist

152
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,010
for the kids' checkup.

153
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,727
Hopefully there's no cavities.

154
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,477
(tranquil music)

155
00:05:28,948 --> 00:05:29,781
- Whoa!

156
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:31,920
It's a little bit nervous making it looks

157
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,390
under construction.

158
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,529
- [Jeremy] Come on buddy.

159
00:05:34,529 --> 00:05:35,548
You're gonna take the stairs?

160
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:36,586
- Caleb and I are gonna take the stairs.

161
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,897
- [Jeremy] They're a
little nervous about this.

162
00:05:37,897 --> 00:05:39,266
- Two?
- Yeah.

163
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:41,199
- Oh maybe they were just
moving something really big

164
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,165
and they wanted to protect the sides.

165
00:05:43,165 --> 00:05:45,915
(tranquil music)

166
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:57,144
- I lost my front tooth.
- I see that,

167
00:05:57,144 --> 00:05:58,882
that's pretty cool, huh.

168
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:01,049
- And another loose tooth.

169
00:06:03,608 --> 00:06:05,663
- [Jeremy] What flavor
did you go with Caleb?

170
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:08,198
- Bubblegum.
- Bubblegum.

171
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:09,880
How 'bout you Laura, what flavor?

172
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,281
- Bubblegum.

173
00:06:11,281 --> 00:06:12,632
- I chose grape.

174
00:06:12,632 --> 00:06:13,619
- [Jeremy] Grape?

175
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:15,464
Let's see what you think of it.

176
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:16,426
- [Dental Assistant]
Have you tried it before?

177
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:17,259
- Yeah.

178
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,892
I always do cookie dough,
grape or birthday cake.

179
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:21,725
- [Dental Assistant] Birthday cake.

180
00:06:21,725 --> 00:06:24,003
The grape's the best though I think too.

181
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:26,664
(upbeat music)

182
00:06:26,664 --> 00:06:27,870
- [Dental Assistant] So birthday cake,

183
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:31,706
strawberry, watermelon,
grape, bubblegum and mint.

184
00:06:31,706 --> 00:06:32,539
- Grape.

185
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:34,629
- [Jeremy] That's the
kind Isaac went with.

186
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:35,462
- Really?

187
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,712
- [Jeremy] Yep.

188
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,873
- [Dental Assistant] Somebody
dressed your socks today.

189
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,989
- [Jeremy] Yeah your
socks aren't matching.

190
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:45,749
What does it taste like Laura?

191
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:47,174
(mumbles)

192
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,740
(laughing)

193
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,631
- I'm filling out paperwork for every kid.

194
00:06:50,631 --> 00:06:51,464
It takes a while.

195
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:52,388
- [Jeremy] Yeah it'd be nice if they had

196
00:06:52,388 --> 00:06:53,472
a copy and paste button.

197
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,305
- Yes.

198
00:06:54,305 --> 00:06:55,381
I'm just really grateful
the kids are healthy,

199
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,343
Makes it easier.

200
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:57,922
And this little girl has no teeth.

201
00:06:57,922 --> 00:07:00,118
- [Jeremy] We think she's teething though.

202
00:07:00,118 --> 00:07:01,581
- Somethin's goin' on.

203
00:07:01,581 --> 00:07:04,164
(upbeat music)

204
00:07:07,294 --> 00:07:08,377
- Okay close.

205
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:14,848
- Our kids like going to the dentist

206
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,621
and I think it's 'cause
they get to watch cartoons.

207
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:19,204
(upbeat music)

208
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:22,209
- [Dentist] You did great.

209
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,193
- [Jeremy] So how do you
feel about the dentist

210
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,120
looking at your teeth?

211
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,953
- Scared.

212
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,087
- [Jeremy] What are you scared of?

213
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:30,693
- I don't want them to
pull out this tooth.

214
00:07:30,693 --> 00:07:32,425
- [Jeremy] You don't want
'em to pull your teeth out?

215
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,690
- [Kendra] He's not gonna
pull any of your teeth out.

216
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,647
He just pulled out Elise's tooth last time

217
00:07:35,647 --> 00:07:37,300
'cause it was wiggly.

218
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,627
But your teeth aren't wiggly yet.

219
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:43,161
So he's not gonna pull
out any of your teeth.

220
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,521
(machine beeping)

221
00:07:45,521 --> 00:07:47,537
- Can you bite down on
this yellow right here?

222
00:07:47,537 --> 00:07:49,552
There's a little indention,
can you put your teeth

223
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,460
right in that indention in the yellow?

224
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,043
(upbeat music)

225
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:58,320
- That's your skeleton.
- Are these just

226
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,347
all of the gums?
- Yeah.

227
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,899
These are teeth that you're
gonna get when you're 12.

228
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,630
These teeth right here
are gonna get loose,

229
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:05,719
and those teeth--
- And those are my

230
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,552
permanent.
- Yep those are

231
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,151
your permanent.
- So which one's

232
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,773
closest to being a loose tooth?

233
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,597
- Probably these top ones right here.

234
00:08:12,597 --> 00:08:13,534
You see that?

235
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,863
It looks like they're about
to fall out on the X-Ray.

236
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,126
- So these ones?
- Mhm.

237
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:18,645
(laughing)

238
00:08:18,645 --> 00:08:19,848
- It's so cool that--
- It's pretty cool

239
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:20,753
isn't it?

240
00:08:20,753 --> 00:08:22,905
- [Kendra] Tell her what to do.

241
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,488
- Lay down and open your mouth.

242
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:30,740
- [Dentist] Have you ever
smelt gross breath before?

243
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,573
No?

244
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:32,462
Well that's good.

245
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:33,738
I am so glad.

246
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:35,472
- I do my dads all the time.

247
00:08:35,472 --> 00:08:36,407
- You do your dads--
- That dude has

248
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,311
gross breath.
- Does your dad

249
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:38,144
have gross breath sometimes?

250
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:38,977
(laughing)

251
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:39,809
Oh man.

252
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,722
What a bummer.
- In the morning.

253
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:43,061
- In the morning?
- It's called morning breath.

254
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,056
- [Dentist] Morning breath.

255
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:45,189
Lots of people have morning breath,

256
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:46,952
especially kids.

257
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:47,785
All right, let's check out these

258
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:48,906
awesome teeth.
- And dads.

259
00:08:48,906 --> 00:08:49,860
- [Dentist] And dads.

260
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,693
Moms don't though.

261
00:08:50,693 --> 00:08:52,111
Open really big.

262
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,042
Moms breath always smells like roses.

263
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,541
You don't have any sugar bugs,

264
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,183
(mumbles) yeah!

265
00:08:58,183 --> 00:08:59,464
Can you open really big buddy?

266
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:01,145
I'm gonna check and see
what we've got here.

267
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:03,584
And you'll kinda feel it
click when it goes through.

268
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,852
- The day when it came out,

269
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:06,924
it was like bleeding.
- Oh whoa.

270
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:08,203
- But it wasn't coming out.

271
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,753
But then when dad wiggled it,

272
00:09:10,753 --> 00:09:12,016
and then it came out.

273
00:09:12,016 --> 00:09:13,428
I didn't want it to come out,

274
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,809
but I wanted it to come out.

275
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:15,843
- [Dentist] Oh I understand.

276
00:09:15,843 --> 00:09:18,608
It's like, ugh, this would
be so cool if it comes out

277
00:09:18,608 --> 00:09:19,893
'cause the tooth fairy can come.

278
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,789
But will it hurt?

279
00:09:21,789 --> 00:09:22,726
And you don't know.

280
00:09:22,726 --> 00:09:24,738
- But it didn't hurt.
- It didn't hurt?

281
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:25,578
Oh, good.

282
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:27,623
And you're six, your
molars are poppin' through

283
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:28,873
down there too.

284
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:32,216
Are you excited for Thanks Giving?

285
00:09:32,216 --> 00:09:34,856
Are you guys gonna travel
anywhere for Thanks Giving?

286
00:09:34,856 --> 00:09:35,862
- Yes.
- Oh where are you

287
00:09:35,862 --> 00:09:36,695
gonna go?

288
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,053
- Spoiler alert.

289
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:41,267
(upbeat music)

290
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:43,046
- [Dentist] Sometimes you
get a whole bunch of plaque

291
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:44,367
and sometimes you don't have any.

292
00:09:44,367 --> 00:09:46,299
- Laura's gonna show Janae how it's done.

293
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,370
- [Jeremy] You're gonna teach her?

294
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,022
- Here you go Naenae.

295
00:09:50,022 --> 00:09:51,630
- You're gonna tell 'em
what you were for Halloween

296
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,792
and then you're gonna open your mouth

297
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,052
and then you get a token.

298
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:55,502
- I was Moana for Halloween.

299
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,843
- [Dentist] Oh boy, I bet that was great!

300
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,062
Moana's so nice!

301
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:00,494
- Even I got makeup on.
- Yeah you had makeup

302
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,476
and everything?

303
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,460
- Even I got my hair curled.

304
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,601
- [Dentist] Oh little miss,

305
00:10:05,601 --> 00:10:08,460
you know that song?
- Even I got shampoo on.

306
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,530
- [Dentist] Wow!

307
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,586
Do you know that song that Moana sings?

308
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:12,419
- Yeah.

309
00:10:12,419 --> 00:10:13,660
- [Dentist] Can you sing it for us?

310
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,937
Do you know it?

311
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:16,154
- I'm still practicing it.

312
00:10:16,154 --> 00:10:17,343
- [Dentist] Oh you're
still practicing that,

313
00:10:17,343 --> 00:10:18,411
it's okay.
(laughing)

314
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,030
- Good job brave girl.
- Just like Moana.

315
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,927
Yeah, wow!
- Good job.

316
00:10:21,927 --> 00:10:23,136
You can watch the show.
- I wonder if you

317
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:24,630
have the same number as Moana.

318
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,734
- [Dentist] Yeah, let's see.

319
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:27,105
I wonder how many Moana has.

320
00:10:27,105 --> 00:10:28,145
Do you wonder?

321
00:10:28,145 --> 00:10:29,269
Let's see how many you have.

322
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:31,235
All right, open really big.

323
00:10:31,235 --> 00:10:32,220
Good job.

324
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,278
Miss Laura, you have 20
teeth and they are beautiful.

325
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,264
High five.
- Good job Laura.

326
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:39,265
- [Dentist] Way to overcome
your fears little miss.

327
00:10:39,265 --> 00:10:40,969
That was awesome.

328
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:43,802
Five for five today!
- No cavities!

329
00:10:45,567 --> 00:10:46,650
Extra tokens.

330
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:50,628
(upbeat music)

331
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:54,445
- [Isaac] I got these two.

332
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,266
(gasping)

333
00:10:57,266 --> 00:11:00,016
- A ring!
- Did you get a ring?

334
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:01,266
- I got a ring!

335
00:11:02,513 --> 00:11:04,382
- [Jeremy] You got a ring.

336
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:05,659
- Go in the elevator.

337
00:11:05,659 --> 00:11:07,094
- We're gonna see which one's faster,

338
00:11:07,094 --> 00:11:10,172
the stairs or the elevator.

339
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:12,339
On your mark, get set, go!

340
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:15,706
- [Jeremy] Let's go fast Laura.

341
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:18,456
(dramatic music)

342
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,314
- Surprise!

343
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:26,205
(cheering)

344
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:27,375
- [Jeremy] It was faster.

345
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:28,445
- We got you.

346
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:29,928
- [Jeremy] The stairs were faster.

347
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:31,470
- [Kendra] The boys are
working on the pinewood derby.

348
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,956
- But we initially had some sandpaper

349
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:34,500
that was like 400 grit.

350
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,067
It was pretty rough.

351
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,496
And Isaac thought we were done.

352
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,348
But what did we do since then?

353
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,795
- We went to a thousand then two thousand.

354
00:11:40,795 --> 00:11:43,750
- So it's super, dee-duper smooth.

355
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,820
- It's like metal or, a car.

356
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,724
It feels amazing.
- A new car.

357
00:11:47,724 --> 00:11:48,920
- [Jeremy] All right, good job.

358
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,190
- I have literally never
felt wood so smooth.

359
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,436
This thing is like, so soft.

360
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,222
I didn't know wood could even do this.

361
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:56,927
So I'm pretty impressed
and excited to see how

362
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:57,804
this turns out.

363
00:11:57,804 --> 00:12:00,971
- That is so soft.
- Isn't it amazing?

364
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,863
- Can I?

365
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:06,946
- [Kendra] Didn't your
brother do an awesome job?

366
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,539
She's so proud of you.

367
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:11,832
All right, dinner tonight
was a crock pot meal.

368
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,674
It's called a HuliHuli chicken.

369
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:15,133
And there's rice and veggies.

370
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,200
- Can I say it, HuliHuli chicken.

371
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,572
HuliHuli chicken.

372
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:21,260
- I like Janae's new bib!

373
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,018
- [Kendra] You think
her new bib is so cute?

374
00:12:23,018 --> 00:12:24,719
- HuliHuli chicken.

375
00:12:24,719 --> 00:12:25,838
- [Kendra] Isn't it fun to say?

376
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,304
- HuliHuli chicken.

377
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:28,236
- HuliHuli chicken.

378
00:12:28,236 --> 00:12:30,614
- HuliHuli chicken, yay!

379
00:12:30,614 --> 00:12:32,482
- [Kendra] Somebody's got some energy.

380
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:33,674
(baby babble)

381
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:34,507
- [Kendra] Yeah.

382
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:35,595
There's your water.

383
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:37,069
And Jeremy doesn't get to be
with us for dinner tonight.

384
00:12:37,069 --> 00:12:38,152
He's working.

385
00:12:39,772 --> 00:12:40,619
- Well I feel bad.

386
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:42,213
I was working late tonight.

387
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,609
I had some unexpected things come up

388
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:46,127
and I wasn't here to help
Kendra at all with dinner.

389
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:48,331
And with five little
kids, dinner by yourself,

390
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:50,158
is hard and it leaves a mess.

391
00:12:50,158 --> 00:12:51,890
All of them are gymnastics now.

392
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,859
So I'm wanting to have them come home

393
00:12:53,859 --> 00:12:55,306
to a clean house.

394
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:57,889
(upbeat music)

395
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:11,627
Sometimes mid-cleaning, I
need an ice cream break.

396
00:13:11,627 --> 00:13:14,210
(upbeat music)

397
00:13:17,908 --> 00:13:19,622
- [Laura] Goodnight, J House out.

398
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:21,384
- [Jeremy] Yeah!

399
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,878
- This is what I'm talking about.

400
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,275
Baby.

401
00:13:24,275 --> 00:13:25,587
- [Kendra] So much pumpkin spice here.

402
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,386
- Could we buy some?

403
00:13:27,386 --> 00:13:28,248
- Never shop hungry.

404
00:13:28,248 --> 00:13:29,914
Or you'll buy really yummy stuff.

405
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:32,022
Whoa, that is a huge nest.

406
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,563
Do you guys see this?

407
00:13:33,563 --> 00:00:00,000
- You spent all my money.
(laughing)
