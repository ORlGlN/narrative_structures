1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,088
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:04,694
- [Kendra] Peak-a-boo.

3
00:00:04,694 --> 00:00:05,838
(Janae making noises)

4
00:00:05,838 --> 00:00:07,240
(Jeremy laughing)

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,160
- [Jeremy] You guys want to go exploring

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,568
in the fort in the ice?

7
00:00:09,568 --> 00:00:11,298
- [Children] Yeah.

8
00:00:11,298 --> 00:00:14,128
(family cheering)

9
00:00:14,128 --> 00:00:16,711
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:25,668 --> 00:00:28,736
(baby laughing)

11
00:00:28,736 --> 00:00:31,657
- [Kendra] Peak-a-boo, where's your mommy?

12
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,360
Peak-a-boo, ahh you found me.

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,160
(baby's laughter)

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
She makes me feel like I'm like hilarious

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,738
cause she laughs so hard.

16
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:40,688
(baby's laughter)

17
00:00:40,688 --> 00:00:42,188
I'm gonna get you.

18
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,860
So we have another ice storm today.

19
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,700
The ice is thick and
beautiful but also dangerous

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,130
on the roads so we are
stuck at home today.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,590
Thankfully, we have something fun to do

22
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,370
and hopefully with the weather forecast,

23
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:54,450
it will clear up later today.

24
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,670
- So Kendra found a book at
the library about Rube Goldberg

25
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,660
and he was an American
inventor, cartoonist.

26
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,060
When he was 11 years old he drew this.

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,090
- What?

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:08,100
- So he knew he loved to draw.

29
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,440
- He's a really good artist.

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,040
- I bet his teacher was impressed.

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,330
- They like said that they posted it up

32
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,340
and it shows what he was most famous for,

33
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:19,100
it was making these
cartoon chain reactions.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,250
This cartoon is supposed to show

35
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,330
how someone can get orange
juice in the morning.

36
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,680
- Alright so this one
is how to get a haircut.

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,520
Okay, so Rube Goldberg
invented these on paper.

38
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,300
Would you guys like to actually build one?

39
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,133
- Yeah.

40
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,290
- A Rube Goldberg machine.

41
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:34,123
- [Children] Uh-huh.

42
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:36,290
- Thank you to Spin Master for
sponsoring our video today.

43
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:37,840
I was really excited when they reached out

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,220
because I've seen these
Rube Goldberg toys around

45
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,600
and I've wanted to try them with the kids

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,190
and today's the perfect
opportunity for that.

47
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,960
Hey Caleb, we've got the
speeding car challenge,

48
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,960
the acrobat challenge and the
rocket challenge, the big one.

49
00:01:51,056 --> 00:01:53,639
(upbeat music)

50
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,378
- [Kendra] Which piece do you need first?

51
00:02:00,378 --> 00:02:01,529
- [Caleb] Looks like this one.

52
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:04,112
(upbeat music)

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,590
- [Kendra] This might
belong to somebody else.

54
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,980
Then that's the last step.

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,220
Okay, now all you do is
roll this ball into that.

56
00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:28,419
- Yay!

57
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,630
- [Jeremy] I think we skipped some steps.

58
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,600
- I just have five more steps.

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,840
- Let's try again.

60
00:02:37,321 --> 00:02:40,000
- Yes, it worked!
- Yay!

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,050
- [Kendra] I'm interested to see

62
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,478
how this chain reaction comes together.

63
00:02:43,478 --> 00:02:44,590
Issac's almost got it.

64
00:02:47,016 --> 00:02:49,704
(suspenseful music)

65
00:02:49,704 --> 00:02:51,037
- [Jeremy] Ohhh.

66
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:54,876
- [Kendra and Jeremy] Ohhh.
- Hiccup.

67
00:02:54,876 --> 00:02:56,496
- It's a hiccup.

68
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:58,260
- [Kendra] Woooo!

69
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,730
- [Jeremy] Let's keep working on it.

70
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,520
I love that these toys require
the kids to problem solve

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,580
and they get to see STEM
principles in action.

72
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,740
They get to see the gravity and the cause

73
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,130
and effect that each action has

74
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:10,730
on the next action and I just love that.

75
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,200
Educational toys that the
kids enjoy, thumbs up for me.

76
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,695
- Ahh, that was the last one.
- Ohh.

77
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:23,950
- Yay!
- We were one step away.

78
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,430
- I know.

79
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,530
- [Kendra] Almost there.

80
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,360
Caleb just wants to keep doing it.

81
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,950
Janae woke up from her nap

82
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,900
and is loving what the kids created.

83
00:03:34,868 --> 00:03:35,893
- Uh-oh.

84
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,083
- [Kendra] Uh-oh.

85
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:37,980
(Kendra laughing)

86
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,570
We keep accidentally
setting these things off,

87
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,900
it's hilarious.

88
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:47,946
Wooooo, the egg even
came out, good job buddy.

89
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,320
- Yay!

90
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
- [Kendra] The acrobat challenge is set.

91
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,104
- [Jeremy] It worked.

92
00:03:54,104 --> 00:03:56,290
(family cheering)

93
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,123
- [Jeremy] We did it.

94
00:03:57,123 --> 00:03:59,240
Thanks again to Spin Master
for sponsoring our video.

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,370
Click the link the
description box to learn more

96
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,946
about these Rube Goldberg activity sets.

97
00:04:03,946 --> 00:04:06,863
(electronic music)

98
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,340
- This is ice.
- [Jeremy] You're eating it?

99
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,353
- [Elise] Uh-huh, it's delicious.

100
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:15,853
- Look what I got.

101
00:04:17,394 --> 00:04:19,977
(upbeat music)

102
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,800
- [Jeremy] It's like you're
walking on ice chips.

103
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,717
- Uh-huh, ohh these things are ahh.

104
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,053
- [Jeremy] Do you guys
want to go exploring

105
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:32,340
in the fort in the ice?

106
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,970
- So in this crazy, cold weather,

107
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,770
I am so grateful to have a garage

108
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,490
because our car is not
freezing or frozen shut.

109
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,460
(instrumental music)

110
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,020
So I absolutely love my local library.

111
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,010
It has a drive up window
so I can pick up holds

112
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:49,150
without even getting out of my car.

113
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,140
Here's my stash today, have I mentioned

114
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,890
that we're trying to learn Spanish?

115
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,710
Wow, our driveway is like solid ice.

116
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,990
- So the kids really wanted to come out

117
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,160
and see what the creek was like out here

118
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,150
with this ice freeze that we've had.

119
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,120
Surprisingly, the water is running here.

120
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,835
The little creek isn't frozen.

121
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:12,335
(funky music)

122
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,560
So when I was a kid
going over barbed wire,

123
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I slipped and was dangling
hooked on to the fence by my leg.

124
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,260
- [Issac] Like, was it in your leg?

125
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,890
- [Jeremy] Yeah, I was stuck
to the barbed wire fence.

126
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:40,190
- [Elise] Who got you?

127
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,430
- [Jeremy] I think my brother came out

128
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,940
and helped pull me off and then we had

129
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,720
to clean it out really good.
- Oh.

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,960
- [Jeremy] But I bled quite a bit.

131
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,932
So you gotta be careful
when you're on fences, okay?

132
00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:49,073
- Okay.

133
00:05:49,073 --> 00:05:51,420
(upbeat music)

134
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,860
- So it is cold out but the little girls

135
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,348
and I are headed to the gym.

136
00:05:55,348 --> 00:05:56,770
I'm going to work out with a friend

137
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,700
and they're gonna hang
out in the daycare center.

138
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,100
- Hi.

139
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,730
- I think this might be
Janae's first time here

140
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,220
so I'm not exactly sure
how Janae is going to do,

141
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,540
I don't usually bring her
so hopefully she'll stay

142
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,943
with the babysitter and let me workout.

143
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,860
(electronic music)

144
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,366
- [Jeremy] Thanks for coming
out adventuring with us.

145
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:21,283
(electronic music)

146
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,361
(Jeremy laughing)

147
00:06:33,361 --> 00:06:34,944
There it is, there.

148
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:41,360
(Jeremy laughing)

149
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,370
So Issac and Elise's
roller skates can convert

150
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,917
into roller blades and they're
wanting to try that today.

151
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:50,500
(upbeat music)

152
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,630
- [Kendra] Are you
playing with the big kids?

153
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,150
Yeah, there's lots of toys.

154
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,447
Will you help take care of Naenae?

155
00:06:56,447 --> 00:06:57,280
- Yeah.

156
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,570
- [Kendra] Are you going
to help too, Britney?

157
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay, you guys have fun.

158
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,730
So my favorite thing to do at the gym

159
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,510
is just to get on the elliptical.

160
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,340
I like it cause it's gentle on my knees

161
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,980
and it's not too hard cause I
don't really like working out

162
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,890
too hard but I love that I have a friend

163
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,600
that I come with and so we
just talk the whole time

164
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,536
and I don't even notice
that I'm working out.

165
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:17,119
(upbeat music)

166
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,540
Well Janae did awesome.

167
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,970
I came in and she was just smiling away.

168
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,670
Did you have fun playing?
- Yeah.

169
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,633
- Well that felt great.

170
00:07:26,633 --> 00:07:27,710
It's so much easier for me to work out

171
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,770
when I have a workout buddy,
makes me be consistent

172
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:31,680
with like getting in and doing
it and not just being like,

173
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,640
oh it's cold out, I don't want

174
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,060
to go today and so, felt good.

175
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,980
(Janae making noises)

176
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,250
- [Kendra] Janae loves this,

177
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,722
Caleb you're such a nice brother.

178
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:41,555
- I'm glad it's not like.

179
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:43,653
(Janae laughing)

180
00:07:43,653 --> 00:07:46,400
I'm glad it's not like 10 pounds.

181
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,830
- [Kendra] She probably weighs
more than 10 pounds, Caleb.

182
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:53,145
- [Jeremy] Issac, you
picked it up pretty quick.

183
00:07:53,145 --> 00:07:56,140
(funky music)

184
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,260
- [Kendra] She's like crazy hair.

185
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,550
So how was roller blading?
- It was really fun.

186
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,430
- [Kendra] Yeah, so which one do you think

187
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,580
you like better roller
skating or roller blading?

188
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,700
- Roller blading because
it just feels more hard

189
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,430
and looks awesome.

190
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,680
- [Kendra] It does look pretty awesome.

191
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,190
So the reason we wanted
to switch them over

192
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,010
to the roller blades was
so you guys could get ready

193
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,490
to learn how to ice skate.

194
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,150
- Yeah, so I'm glad when I
get on the ice rink, zoom.

195
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,630
- [Kendra] Yeah, you're gonna go crazy.

196
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,100
We're hoping to go ice skating soon.

197
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,430
- That's gonna be fun.

198
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,008
- Poll question, do you like
roller skates or roller blades?

199
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,779
Womp, womp.
- Womp, womp.

200
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,362
(upbeat music)

201
00:08:36,256 --> 00:08:39,423
- (speaks in Spanish)

202
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,150
- So in college, Kendra
actually did a study abroad

203
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,790
in Mexico and we want to make sure

204
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:47,620
our kids are familiar with Spanish.

205
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,880
- Well it's bedtime, we're in our pajamas

206
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,300
and we should be getting into bed

207
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,960
but Caleb wants to try his
chain reaction one more time

208
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,480
and Jeremy has a crazy idea up his sleeve.

209
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,450
- I just want to see if we can get his car

210
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,680
to hit this one and make
bigger chain reaction.

211
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,440
- [Kendra] Caleb's got
his speedy car challenge

212
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,720
all the way hooked up,
all loaded, ready to go.

213
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,520
That ball's gonna be getting it all.

214
00:09:11,971 --> 00:09:13,120
Laura, do you think it's gonna work?

215
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,000
- Yeah.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,730
- I feel like the mark of a good toy is

217
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,563
when the adults enjoy playing with it.

218
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:19,486
- Alright, we're gonna
see if it will work.

219
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:22,069
(upbeat music)

220
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,688
(family cheers)

221
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,761
- Now it didn't do everything just right.

222
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:38,760
- [Caleb] But it worked.

223
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,520
- But it shot the acrobat.
- [Kendra] The acrobat flew.

224
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,353
- Yep, so that was fun.

225
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:44,310
- It just like everything
went down and bam.

226
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,990
Goodnight J House.

227
00:09:52,035 --> 00:09:54,100
(Laura humming)

228
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,560
- So the boys are just
looking out the window

229
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,033
and they think they see bobcat on a tree.

230
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:02,139
(upbeat music)

231
00:10:02,139 --> 00:00:00,000
- What is that noise,
stop making that noise.
