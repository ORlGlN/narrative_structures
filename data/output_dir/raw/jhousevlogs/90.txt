1
00:00:00,864 --> 00:00:01,697
- Gingerbread houses?

2
00:00:01,697 --> 00:00:02,584
- Butter cookies!

3
00:00:02,584 --> 00:00:03,918
- [Mom] Butter cookies?

4
00:00:03,918 --> 00:00:05,845
(gasps)

5
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:07,099
Caught ya!

6
00:00:07,099 --> 00:00:08,000
(laughs)

7
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,805
So you guys get to build a device

8
00:00:09,805 --> 00:00:10,638
that can safely carry your cookie.

9
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:11,471
One, two, three, drop!

10
00:00:14,743 --> 00:00:17,993
- [Dad] These pajamas make me so happy.

11
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:22,068
- ♪ Come on in! ♪

12
00:00:22,068 --> 00:00:25,503
- So, this morning I
feel really productive

13
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:28,070
and simultaneously like I'm never

14
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:30,034
getting anything done.

15
00:00:30,034 --> 00:00:31,147
It's such a funny feeling.

16
00:00:31,147 --> 00:00:33,076
Anyway, my kitchen is clean

17
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,574
and it's beautiful.

18
00:00:34,574 --> 00:00:36,094
The dishes are done, the
dishwasher's unloaded,

19
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:37,358
the floor is swept.

20
00:00:37,358 --> 00:00:38,802
It's lovely; the bathrooms are clean.

21
00:00:38,802 --> 00:00:40,915
And then I turn around the corner

22
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,939
and look what I see.

23
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:42,772
Front room

24
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,368
is a disaster.

25
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,794
And with having just gotten home

26
00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:53,457
from a trip and prepping for Christmas,

27
00:00:53,457 --> 00:00:58,043
and just normal life, my
room is the worst of all.

28
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:01,293
(suspense movie music)

29
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,245
Seriously?

30
00:01:05,245 --> 00:01:08,163
Seriously, this is so embarrassing.

31
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:11,673
So here's the moral of the story.

32
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,987
What I want to do is deep clean

33
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:16,405
for my entire day, but I what I know

34
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,927
I need to do is pause right here

35
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:21,801
and do some fun stuff with the kids.

36
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:24,185
Anyway, now it's time
for our first activity.

37
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,470
Who wants to make...

38
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,470
- Drum roll.

39
00:01:28,349 --> 00:01:30,291
- What do you think we're gonna make?

40
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,141
- Cookies.

41
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:31,974
- Cookies.

42
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:32,807
- Gingerbread houses?

43
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:33,767
- Butter cookies!

44
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:34,761
- [Mom] Not gingerbread.

45
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,011
Butter cookies?

46
00:01:37,634 --> 00:01:41,652
We are going to use what's
called a cookie press.

47
00:01:41,652 --> 00:01:42,485
- What?

48
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:44,061
- The heck?

49
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:45,646
- It's like a little gun that you pull

50
00:01:45,646 --> 00:01:47,698
the trigger and it shoots out cookies.

51
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:49,640
(child laughs)

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,517
Who wants to try it?

53
00:01:50,517 --> 00:01:54,750
- I can just shoot it into Isaac's mouth.

54
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,618
(imitates cookie dough spraying)

55
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:56,537
- You guys are goofy.

56
00:01:56,537 --> 00:01:59,053
So I used a cookie press
once when I was a kid

57
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,218
with my mom and I thought it was so cool.

58
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:03,275
And so I saw one on sale

59
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:05,485
and I had a coupon, so
I got one to try it.

60
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:09,154
- Well, how will it come
out of the little jar thing?

61
00:02:09,154 --> 00:02:10,913
- [Mom] So there's different shapes.

62
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:13,929
These are the different
disks and you can choose

63
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,602
which shape you want the cookie to be.

64
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:17,285
Kind of like you choose cookie cutters.

65
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:20,035
We put this piece down here. See?

66
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:25,615
- How do you get the cookies out?

67
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:27,291
- [Mom] We squeeze 'em.

68
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:29,204
So we're going to learn how to do it.

69
00:02:29,204 --> 00:02:30,069
Who wants to try it with me?

70
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,197
- [All the Kids] Me!

71
00:02:31,197 --> 00:02:32,399
- I wish I got that kind of a reaction

72
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,469
when I asked the kids
to do chores with me.

73
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:35,182
We're just gonna try this recipe

74
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,849
that comes with the cookie press.

75
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,567
All right, so here's the different disks.

76
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,785
Let's make the batter.

77
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,134
I meant the dough.

78
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:42,028
- Eggs.

79
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:42,974
- Check!

80
00:02:42,974 --> 00:02:44,543
- Vanilla extract.

81
00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:45,376
- Check!

82
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,696
- Almond extract.

83
00:02:47,696 --> 00:02:49,179
- Check!

84
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:50,685
- I let the kids gather
all the ingredients.

85
00:02:50,685 --> 00:02:52,279
They did a really good job.

86
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:54,862
(upbeat music)

87
00:02:59,271 --> 00:03:00,505
- [Mom] It's the beginning
of a good recipe, isn't it?

88
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:01,338
- Uh-huh.

89
00:03:01,338 --> 00:03:04,446
- We must've done three
things of butter crumbs.

90
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:05,770
- [Mom] Think it's gonna be gross?

91
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:08,117
- No, I think it's gonna be yummy,

92
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:10,234
because so much butter.

93
00:03:10,234 --> 00:03:11,103
- [Mom] It is a lot of butter.

94
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:12,505
These are definitely not healthy cookies.

95
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:13,725
Dump it in.

96
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:14,633
Now we're supposed to beat

97
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,059
it til it's light and fluffy.

98
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,601
(mixer whirring)

99
00:03:17,601 --> 00:03:19,756
There you go; let's let
it do that for a minute.

100
00:03:19,756 --> 00:03:21,115
- [Child] Could we go a little faster?

101
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,097
- [Child] Pour it in!

102
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,680
(bright music)

103
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,229
- [Mom] All right, dump it in.

104
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:35,815
- [Child] That looks like boogies!

105
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:37,542
- It looks like boogies.

106
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:41,375
- [Mom] We're ready to
start adding the flour.

107
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,530
Go for it, Lis!

108
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:47,861
Last one!

109
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,645
Is the almond extract in it?

110
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,562
You're gonna love this.

111
00:03:56,577 --> 00:03:57,876
- And start.

112
00:03:57,876 --> 00:03:59,486
- No!

113
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:02,754
- [Dad] What is this
thing called? Cookie gun?

114
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:04,077
- Cookie press.

115
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,910
- [Dad] Cookie press?

116
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,206
- So I'm supposed to fill
the barrel with dough.

117
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:10,039
- Oh no, she's taking her revenge!

118
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,867
- Now we need a disk!

119
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:15,328
- [Child] Okay, let's
do the Christmas tree.

120
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:18,421
- All right, I think that goes like that.

121
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:20,918
And then this goes like this.

122
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,577
Now it says that my
arrows need to line up.

123
00:04:22,577 --> 00:04:26,025
This feels so technical
for making a cookie.

124
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:28,838
Hold press upright with the ring

125
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:31,505
firmly against the cookie sheet.

126
00:04:33,025 --> 00:04:35,489
Squeeze the trigger to form a cookie.

127
00:04:35,489 --> 00:04:37,537
One click is one cookie.

128
00:04:37,537 --> 00:04:39,695
(Classical music)

129
00:04:39,695 --> 00:04:41,516
- [Dad] A cookie was born.

130
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:43,599
(laughs)

131
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:47,164
- [Child] Push that thing, Mom.

132
00:04:48,385 --> 00:04:49,639
- There's a cookie!

133
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:50,606
- [Dad] Uh-oh, there's two cookies!

134
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:51,572
- So it says it doesn't work on

135
00:04:51,572 --> 00:04:52,476
non-stick pans, but I
think all of our pans

136
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:56,408
are non-stick, so I'm
gonna try an older pan.

137
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:58,265
(gasps)

138
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:00,007
It's a cookie!

139
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,332
(all clapping and cheering)

140
00:05:01,332 --> 00:05:02,874
(Dad laughs)

141
00:05:02,874 --> 00:05:03,774
You don't have to squeeze hard.

142
00:05:03,774 --> 00:05:04,607
There we go.

143
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,245
Now try lifting it up. Let's see.

144
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:07,718
(clapping)

145
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:08,551
- Another one!

146
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:09,384
- [Mom] You did!

147
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,134
- It's kinda smushed.

148
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,710
- [Mom] It's kinda smushed.

149
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,553
There you go. Now lift it up.

150
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:18,163
You did it!

151
00:05:18,163 --> 00:05:18,996
- I smushed it.

152
00:05:18,996 --> 00:05:20,948
- [Mom] Got it.

153
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:21,781
(children laughing)

154
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:22,614
That one...

155
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:23,625
- [Dad] A snowman.

156
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,037
- [Mom] Hi, Janay!

157
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:25,870
- Hi!

158
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,752
- I woke up from my nap.

159
00:05:26,752 --> 00:05:28,502
- [Mom] I caught you.

160
00:05:29,588 --> 00:05:30,707
Are you eating?

161
00:05:30,707 --> 00:05:32,740
Are you sneaking?

162
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,957
- Isaac did it, too.

163
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:35,634
- [Mom] How's the dough? Is it good?

164
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:36,778
- Mm hmm.

165
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:40,124
- [Mom] We decided to add
some sprinkles, some green.

166
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:41,584
Let's see how these turn out.

167
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:42,631
Second batch going in.

168
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:46,718
All right, Leesie. Give
it a try. Let it out.

169
00:05:46,718 --> 00:05:49,473
Now we're becoming a factory.

170
00:05:49,473 --> 00:05:50,306
Got it!

171
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,056
(cheerful music)

172
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:58,047
We decided that this one looks

173
00:05:58,047 --> 00:06:00,380
a little bit like spaghetti.

174
00:06:01,927 --> 00:06:02,946
I don't think it turned out to be

175
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,778
the snowflake we were hoping for.

176
00:06:04,778 --> 00:06:06,379
- That is awesome.

177
00:06:06,379 --> 00:06:08,712
Whoa, I know they're for me.

178
00:06:10,515 --> 00:06:12,956
(children laughing)

179
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,706
- [Dad] What? What are you doing?

180
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,719
(laughter)

181
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:23,926
- [Dad] Perfect.

182
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,077
- Oh, that looks good!

183
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:27,361
- [Mom] Even Jeremy wanted
to get in on the fun.

184
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,861
- [Dad] It is fun.

185
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:33,010
- [Child] Wow, you're making at it, Dad.

186
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,843
- So the problem with
these cookies is that I

187
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,813
think I will eat one and I'm like,

188
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,323
"That's only like a quarter of a cookie"

189
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:39,247
so I'll eat like three
more, and out of nowhere

190
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:40,080
you've eaten 50

191
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,875
cookies and didn't realize it.

192
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:43,533
- [Mom] So what do you think
of using a cookie press?

193
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:46,968
- I like it more than
making bigger cookies,

194
00:06:46,968 --> 00:06:50,309
but there's so much so
I could just go like

195
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:52,048
(munching sounds)

196
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:52,991
(child singing in the background)

197
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:56,741
- Those look so yummy
I wanna eat all of 'em.

198
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,714
Can I eat all of them today?

199
00:07:00,714 --> 00:07:01,710
- [Mom] You know what?
I'm not gonna let you eat

200
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,244
all of them but we will
let you eat some of 'em.

201
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,077
- Aww.

202
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,470
- [Mom] Caught ya.

203
00:07:13,756 --> 00:07:15,823
- It's so warm.

204
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:18,073
- [Dad] It is warm out here.

205
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,705
- By the way, what'd you
guys think of our curtains?

206
00:07:21,705 --> 00:07:24,891
So here's the curtains,
here's what they look like.

207
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:28,757
- I like how we have blue
with the white walls.

208
00:07:28,757 --> 00:07:31,430
- [Mom] I think our walls
are technically greige,

209
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,754
which means half gray, half beige.

210
00:07:33,754 --> 00:07:35,337
But here's what the curtains look like.

211
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:38,665
I love the texture and
I love that we can pull

212
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:42,332
these, and I love this
boy, and this is what

213
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:48,311
Isaac looks like, just
in case you were curious.

214
00:07:48,311 --> 00:07:50,301
This is what he looks like.

215
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,912
(laughs)

216
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:52,973
Whatcha reading?

217
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:54,013
- The Nutcracker.

218
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:55,163
- [Mom] Let's see. Let's see the front.

219
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,653
- The Nutcracker.

220
00:07:56,653 --> 00:07:59,124
I've always wanted to see the real ballet.

221
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,642
- [Mom] Ooh, maybe someday you will.

222
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:03,862
- Leesie, when you're
that age you'll be able

223
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,465
to do that.

224
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,524
- [Mom] Oh, you think she's
gonna be in The Nutcracker?

225
00:08:07,524 --> 00:08:09,705
- When you're 15 years old.

226
00:08:09,705 --> 00:08:10,978
- [Mom] Whoa.

227
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:12,034
All right, Caleb, what are you reading?

228
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:15,333
Mortimer's Christmas Manger. Good pick.

229
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,015
I have a fun project for
the kids this afternoon.

230
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,262
What do you guys think's gonna happen

231
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:20,580
if I drop this on the table?

232
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,413
- It will crack.

233
00:08:21,413 --> 00:08:22,412
- Do we all agree?

234
00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,579
- Depends on how it lands.

235
00:08:27,421 --> 00:08:29,197
- What happened?

236
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,477
- It broke in half.

237
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,582
- Now, come over here
to the kitchen floor.

238
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:34,168
So what do you guys think's gonna happen

239
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:35,888
if I drop it from up here?

240
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:37,683
- It'll break totally.

241
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,515
- You think so?

242
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:39,726
- No, I don't think it's gonna break.

243
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,144
- So you don't think this is gonna break?

244
00:08:44,245 --> 00:08:45,516
(crack)

245
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:46,917
- Oh!

246
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,310
- I knew it!

247
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,730
- It did, it went to more pieces.

248
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,070
Why did it go into more pieces?

249
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,541
- Because it was higher,
and then when it's higher

250
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,405
it gets more damaged.

251
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,464
- Okay, what do you think will happen

252
00:08:57,464 --> 00:08:58,528
if I drop it from right here?

253
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:00,611
- It's gonna land safely.

254
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:03,344
(all cheering)

255
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:06,606
- All right, so here is the challenge.

256
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:09,024
This time of year, people
send lots of packages

257
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:10,827
in the mail and do you
think they're very gentle

258
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,662
with the packages all the time?

259
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:14,797
- No.

260
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:15,962
- No, they get kind of rocked around.

261
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,692
So we are going to see if
you guys can build a way

262
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,119
to ship these cookies
so that even though they

263
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,691
get dropped they don't break.

264
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,156
So what happens if your
cookie doesn't break?

265
00:09:26,156 --> 00:09:28,239
- Then you get to eat it.

266
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:30,953
- So basically we're doing
a cookie drop assignment.

267
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:31,993
Kinda like the egg drop.

268
00:09:31,993 --> 00:09:33,492
The kids have to package their cookie

269
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:34,780
in such a way that we can drop it from

270
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,888
the top of the stairs and it will land

271
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:37,857
without breaking.

272
00:09:37,857 --> 00:09:39,274
They also get a point for how cute

273
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:40,369
their package looks.

274
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,192
So I got out some supplies:
There's bubble wrap,

275
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:45,775
tissue paper, and this
is our creation bin.

276
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:50,613
It's full of all sorts of everything.

277
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:51,883
So you guys get to build a device

278
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,646
that can safely carry your cookie.

279
00:09:53,646 --> 00:09:57,439
- Gotta make sure it
can't fall out and somehow

280
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,939
tape that on here.

281
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,040
- [Mom] So Laurie, you
have to pack a cookie

282
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,011
so that it won't break
when you drop it, okay?

283
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:10,028
- I'm popping my bubbles
so that it can land safely.

284
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,183
- [Mom] Oh, so you're
gonna pop the bubbles

285
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:13,016
so it can land safely?

286
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:17,122
- I don't think that's such a good idea.

287
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,914
- That sounds very Laura-like.

288
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:23,140
- [Mom] So bubble wrap seems
to be the device of choice.

289
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,806
What do you guys think is
better, the larger containers

290
00:10:24,806 --> 00:10:26,346
or the smaller containers?

291
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:27,179
- Larger.

292
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,012
- Smaller.

293
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,517
- [Mom] Whoa, there's a division.

294
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:33,600
- I'm trying to make
as much layers as I can

295
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,459
on the bubble wrap so
then when it goes around,

296
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:39,042
it's like, boop! Nice and soft.

297
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,975
- I'm going to put this over last.

298
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,211
- [Mom] So you decided
to put some bubble wrap

299
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,044
on the inside?

300
00:10:46,044 --> 00:10:46,877
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:48,408
- [Mom] Why'd you decide
to put some on the inside?

302
00:10:48,408 --> 00:10:50,957
- So that it won't like bounce around.

303
00:10:50,957 --> 00:10:52,304
- I have to make it a little bit better.

304
00:10:52,304 --> 00:10:53,471
Pull that out.

305
00:10:54,408 --> 00:10:57,817
- I'm actually sending a package, folks.

306
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,925
- [Mom] Who are you gonna send it to?

307
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,675
- I'm gonna send it to you.

308
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,413
Look what's inside of it: Bubble wrap.

309
00:11:05,413 --> 00:11:06,414
- [Mom] Nice.

310
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:08,416
Did you put a bunch of paper in that?

311
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,783
- I just put two in there.

312
00:11:10,783 --> 00:11:12,360
- [Mom] Did it break?

313
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,989
(gasps)

314
00:11:13,989 --> 00:11:15,701
It didn't break?

315
00:11:15,701 --> 00:11:16,534
- Can I eat it?

316
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,643
- No, not yet. We've got to drop it

317
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:18,811
from the top of the stairs.

318
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,508
Laurie, you're doing a great job.

319
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,708
- I'm still taping it.

320
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:23,916
- So Janay just woke up from her nap

321
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,231
and there's so much going on down here

322
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,350
that I won't let her out of my lap,

323
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,353
and she's like going crazy.

324
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:30,190
She's like "I wanna play with everything!"

325
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,440
Hi, are you stuck right here with Mama?

326
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,464
- [Child] Janay-nay!

327
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:36,682
- [Mom] Are you gonna use a bag?

328
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:37,726
- Yep.

329
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:38,660
- [Mom] Nice.

330
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,124
- And tape it in.

331
00:11:40,124 --> 00:11:42,874
(relaxing music)

332
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:49,635
- Watching Laura participate
in these kinds of things

333
00:11:49,635 --> 00:11:51,901
always just makes me really happy.

334
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:53,190
Like, it's fun to see her creativity

335
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,017
and her problem-solving skills coming out

336
00:11:56,017 --> 00:11:59,168
even though I thought of it
as an older-kid activity.

337
00:11:59,168 --> 00:12:00,109
Caleb, what do you think?

338
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,714
- I think it'll do good.

339
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,749
- [Mom] It looks awesome.

340
00:12:02,749 --> 00:12:04,157
All right, Caleb, are you ready?

341
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,076
- Mm-hmm.

342
00:12:05,076 --> 00:12:06,042
- [Mom] Set?

343
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:06,875
Drop!

344
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,234
- [Caleb] I think it's safe.

345
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:12,156
- [Mom] You think it's safe?

346
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,989
Run, run, run. Go see.

347
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:16,587
Bust it open!

348
00:12:16,587 --> 00:12:19,149
(tearing)

349
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:22,649
If the cookie survives, he gets to eat it.

350
00:12:24,728 --> 00:12:26,395
- [Dad] It survived!

351
00:12:27,755 --> 00:12:28,588
(cheering)

352
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:29,421
Good job!

353
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:30,254
- [Mom] Did it work?

354
00:12:30,254 --> 00:12:31,087
Show me the cookie.

355
00:12:31,087 --> 00:12:31,920
Yes!

356
00:12:33,105 --> 00:12:36,024
Here's Isaac's Christmas cookie package.

357
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:37,057
What do you think your odds are?

358
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:37,890
- Right there.

359
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,740
I think it's gonna make it, for sure.

360
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,573
- [Mom] On your mark,

361
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:41,406
get set,

362
00:12:42,323 --> 00:12:43,156
drop!

363
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,037
- It landed not good.

364
00:12:47,037 --> 00:12:48,056
- [Mom] I think it's safe.

365
00:12:48,056 --> 00:12:49,544
- [Dad] Open it up.

366
00:12:49,544 --> 00:12:50,544
There it is!

367
00:12:52,969 --> 00:12:54,994
It's broken now.

368
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:56,386
- [Mom] Merry Christmas!

369
00:12:56,386 --> 00:12:58,377
- I don't really know
how to spell Christmas

370
00:12:58,377 --> 00:13:00,189
so I just sounded it out.

371
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:02,689
- [Mom] One, two, three, drop!

372
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:06,470
- [Child] Go down.

373
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:07,898
- [Dad] And it survived!

374
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:09,554
Good job. You get to eat it!

375
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,637
- Sorry, Dad.

376
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,746
- [Dad] You can have it.

377
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:15,225
- Sorry that you don't get any.

378
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:16,194
- [Dad] Yeah, that's okay.

379
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,648
- [Mom] All right, here's
Laura's final project.

380
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:20,795
All right, Laura, you ready?

381
00:13:20,795 --> 00:13:21,943
One, two, three, drop!

382
00:13:21,943 --> 00:13:24,517
(children laughing)

383
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:26,497
- [Dad] That's something.

384
00:13:26,497 --> 00:13:30,179
- [Mom] All right, go for it, Laura!

385
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,412
Let's see!

386
00:13:31,412 --> 00:13:32,245
- [Dad] How'd it do?

387
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,162
Let's see, how'd it do?

388
00:13:36,064 --> 00:13:37,299
(gasps)

389
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:38,299
It survived!

390
00:13:41,534 --> 00:13:43,704
The oatmeal box was super heavy,

391
00:13:43,704 --> 00:13:45,608
but it was inside of there.

392
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:47,257
She had it all safe.

393
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:48,838
- [Mom] She did it all by herself.

394
00:13:48,838 --> 00:13:50,898
I did not help her with one single thing.

395
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:53,481
(upbeat music)

396
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:57,827
So we got two different kinds of burgers

397
00:13:57,827 --> 00:13:59,363
and then we're sharing 'em.

398
00:13:59,363 --> 00:14:00,800
We're definitely food-sharers.

399
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,633
- [Dad] Yep.

400
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:03,210
- Or at least I am, so
Jeremy puts up with it.

401
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,710
- [Dad] We got the Bonsai Burger and...

402
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,354
- This one's called the Mad Love.

403
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,274
We haven't tried it before.

404
00:14:07,274 --> 00:14:10,804
- Well, I ate way more food
than a person should ever eat.

405
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:13,554
It hurts to move. I'm struggling.

406
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,063
So we're picking up a couple
potential Christmas gifts.

407
00:14:19,063 --> 00:14:22,247
I don't know why, but these
pajamas make me so happy.

408
00:14:22,247 --> 00:14:23,080
- [Mom] Those aren't pajamas!

409
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,914
That's like a coat with pajama bottoms.

410
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:25,809
- You would wear that out?

411
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:27,534
Like somewhere not just
laying in your bed?

412
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,321
- I wouldn't wear that.

413
00:14:29,321 --> 00:14:31,145
This is for a baby.

414
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:33,207
This is like their warmness.

415
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:34,556
- The polar bear outfit.

416
00:14:34,556 --> 00:14:35,753
- Yeah, it's their little coat.

417
00:14:35,753 --> 00:14:36,586
We had one of these for
Elise when she was born.

418
00:14:36,586 --> 00:14:39,046
- [Dad] They crack me up.

419
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:41,405
- [Mom] When Elise was born it
was in the middle of January

420
00:14:41,405 --> 00:14:43,358
in Utah and it was really cold.

421
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:44,796
Oh, look at these shoes!

422
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:45,789
- [Dad] They're sparkly.

423
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:49,231
- Do you know who would
like sparkly shoes?

424
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,064
- [Dad] Isaac?

425
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:50,897
(Mom laughs)

426
00:14:50,897 --> 00:14:52,649
- [Mom] That was a funny laugh.

427
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:54,101
(Dad laughs)

428
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,180
It says "Little Sister."

429
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,608
- So when we were coming in here,

430
00:14:57,608 --> 00:15:01,628
Kendra said my job is
to try to make us leave

431
00:15:01,628 --> 00:15:02,540
before an hour of time passed while Kendra

432
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,350
wanders around looking
at every single thing.

433
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,468
- There's just so many cute
things and they're little!

434
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,265
- Okay, let's go. Good night.

435
00:15:10,265 --> 00:15:11,098
J-House.

436
00:15:13,015 --> 00:15:14,383
Uh-oh.

437
00:15:14,383 --> 00:15:16,106
- Mom plus Dad equals Me.

438
00:15:16,106 --> 00:15:18,000
- That is really cute.

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,902
Okay, J-House out.

440
00:15:18,902 --> 00:15:20,883
So we were invited out by one
of the local news stations

441
00:15:20,883 --> 00:15:22,453
to come and show the kids around

442
00:15:22,453 --> 00:15:25,620
to see what happens at a news station.

443
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,368
(laughs)

444
00:15:28,368 --> 00:15:30,235
- Jacob farted!

445
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,365
- That'd be a good anniversary gift.

446
00:15:32,365 --> 00:00:00,000
- He got the curtains hung up.
