1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,960
- This is not a good place for me to come

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,420
and learn about what's lying in the ocean.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:06,696
- [Jeremy] Right where we were at.

4
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:09,279
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:12,107 --> 00:00:15,079
- [Kendra] This is a shark
egg, this thing right here.

6
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,610
♪ Happy Birthday ♪

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,193
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:26,898 --> 00:00:28,815
- Happy birthday to me.

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,796
I feel like this was eating me.

10
00:00:32,796 --> 00:00:35,379
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,970
- [Jeremy] You're doing
a tour of the ship?

12
00:00:47,819 --> 00:00:50,402
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,500
- This is the size of a penny.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,610
These are the size of these organisms

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,290
that are so tiny and
they're called plankton.

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,470
So now what we wanna do is try to match

17
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,810
some of these to some of these.

18
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,720
See if you can figure out which
kind of plankton they are.

19
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,137
These are little tiny organisms
that live in the ocean.

20
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:08,990
- Found a match.

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,370
- You did, you found a match.

22
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,450
- [Woman] Those are supposed to be krill

23
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,963
and we're looking at little tiny plankton.

24
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:16,880
- Are they alive?

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,236
- [Woman] Yeah, they're still alive.

26
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,940
And this is what they'll look like.

27
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,910
- [Jeremy] Just looks
like saltwater kind of .

28
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,120
- [Woman] So every little dot that you see

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,700
is one of those animals on the screen.

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,080
So they're really, really tiny.

31
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,770
The microscope just makes them look large.

32
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,240
- [Woman] Do you see it Laura?

33
00:01:33,609 --> 00:01:36,192
(guitar music)

34
00:01:38,694 --> 00:01:40,670
- [Jeremy] There he is.

35
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,503
You're in Laura.

36
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,364
(guitar music)

37
00:01:50,536 --> 00:01:51,510
It's kind of like a cow.

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,990
That's pretty good.

39
00:02:09,484 --> 00:02:12,984
(upbeat orchestral music)

40
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,399
- It's so weird, it's not like real sand.

41
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,421
- [Jeremy] What is this?

42
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,254
- [Kendra] This is kinetic sand

43
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,430
and we get to shape our own seafloor.

44
00:02:26,643 --> 00:02:28,524
Are you digging a ditch?

45
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:29,894
- [Isaac] Yeah and now it's purple.

46
00:02:29,894 --> 00:02:32,477
(upbeat music)

47
00:02:45,336 --> 00:02:47,086
- Whoa, it's so fast.

48
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,260
- I'm setting it in a trap.

49
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,346
- [Kendra] Uh oh, did you trap it?

50
00:02:53,346 --> 00:02:54,554
- [Laura] Yeah.

51
00:02:54,554 --> 00:02:55,630
- [Kendra] Oh there it is Caleb,

52
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,740
you're turning on the light.

53
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,050
So he is making waves
to power a lighthouse.

54
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:06,837
(upbeat music)

55
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,950
So this aquarium overlooks the beach

56
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,130
that we played at yesterday.

57
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,160
That's just really fun.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,340
Caleb just looked out on it

59
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,710
and he said, do you think
my tunnel's still there Mom?

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,543
Who knows?

61
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:20,610
Leesy's turn, can you
light the lighthouse?

62
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:22,790
- Oh, I'm lighting it.

63
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,940
- [Kendra] Good job.

64
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,300
Laura, you wanna try?

65
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,400
Gotta push hard.

66
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,140
They are still going at it.

67
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,270
Whoa!

68
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,430
That thing is fast.

69
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:36,344
You guys made a super fast track.

70
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:38,927
(upbeat music)

71
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,400
As a family, we're doing an experiment.

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,240
We're trying to figure out
if a straight path is faster,

73
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,330
or the curved path goes faster.

74
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,230
So what's your guess?

75
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:55,010
Who thinks the straight
path will go fastest?

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,950
Who thinks the curved one will go fastest?

77
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,040
Okay, you guys ready?

78
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:05,556
(epic music)

79
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,720
So the straight path was clearly faster.

80
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,120
- Sting ray with the long nose.

81
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,640
- So I have a question, these
are called leopard sharks

82
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,480
and when a mommy leopard
shark is pregnant,

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,330
how many babies do you think she has?

84
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:22,287
- Five.

85
00:04:22,287 --> 00:04:23,309
- You think five?

86
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:24,261
How many do you guess Isaac?

87
00:04:24,261 --> 00:04:25,306
- Two.

88
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,304
- Two.

89
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,326
- 35.

90
00:04:27,326 --> 00:04:28,730
- Caleb how many babies do you think?

91
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,563
- Three.

92
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:30,554
- Three?

93
00:04:30,554 --> 00:04:31,506
- [Jeremy] I think one.

94
00:04:31,506 --> 00:04:32,876
- They can have up to 38.

95
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:33,967
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

96
00:04:33,967 --> 00:04:35,244
- 35.

97
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:37,827
(upbeat music)

98
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,330
- [Kendra] Okay, the leopard shark is one

99
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,740
of the most common sharks
along the California coast.

100
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,720
Leopard sharks typically
stay on or near the bottom

101
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,200
and they favor warm, shallow
water near the shore.

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,750
- [Jeremy] Right where we were.

103
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,250
- This is not a good place for me to come

104
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,900
and learn about what's lying in the ocean.

105
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,220
- [Jeremy] Right where we were at.

106
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,295
- [Kendra] So this one's called a bat ray.

107
00:05:02,295 --> 00:05:03,340
- [Elise] It has lips.

108
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,440
- [Kendra] It looks like
the cutest little face.

109
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,920
- [Jeremy] Well hello.

110
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,510
I like your lipstick.

111
00:05:08,611 --> 00:05:11,210
(upbeat music)

112
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,360
- This is so creepy, we're
never going to the beach again,

113
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,020
ever.

114
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,297
- [Jeremy] There's so
many fish that are like

115
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:17,130
right under the sand.

116
00:05:19,408 --> 00:05:22,240
- Okay, now everybody find
a gray, smooth hound shark.

117
00:05:23,379 --> 00:05:24,401
- Up there.

118
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:25,515
- [Jeremy] Yep, you found it Elise.

119
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,870
- [Kendra] So guys look,

120
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,740
this is where we were yesterday.

121
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,570
You see there's the playground
and the parking lot.

122
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,337
We were like right there.

123
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,359
- [Isaac] Oh, we're right there.

124
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:38,310
- [Kendra] Yep, now we're
here and there's the pier.

125
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,331
- [Isaac] We ran there and back.

126
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,353
- [Kendra] We did.

127
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,419
And where were the seals
and sea lions we saw?

128
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:43,441
Do you guys remember?

129
00:05:43,441 --> 00:05:44,811
- They're on here.

130
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:46,158
- Yep, right there.

131
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:47,458
Well Isaac luckily read the fine print

132
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:48,898
and it says that leopard
sharks come in the summer.

133
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:49,731
So looks like we came to San Diego

134
00:05:49,731 --> 00:05:51,130
at the right time of year.

135
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,170
Thanks for holding the door.

136
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,051
(upbeat music)

137
00:05:55,051 --> 00:05:56,653
- [Jeremy] This is the Infinity Cube.

138
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:59,236
(upbeat music)

139
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,194
- [Kendra] So now pull it up.

140
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:39,680
There you go, now you can see it up close.

141
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,050
- [Jeremy] Look at this.

142
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,350
You guys, that's not a rock.

143
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,115
Do you guys see this?

144
00:06:44,115 --> 00:06:45,800
- [Caleb] There's just rocks.

145
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,109
- [Jeremy] No, that's a crab.

146
00:06:48,109 --> 00:06:49,409
- [Caleb] At the bottom.

147
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,326
- I see it.

148
00:06:51,267 --> 00:06:53,410
- It's just like finding Dori.

149
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,243
And look at that.

150
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,190
- [Kendra] Do you guys see it?

151
00:06:56,143 --> 00:06:57,164
- [Jeremy] All the tentacles.

152
00:06:57,164 --> 00:06:58,186
- [Kendra] Look at those tentacles

153
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,340
with all those suction cups.

154
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,510
Seahorses are masters of disguise

155
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,130
that can change color to
blend with their surroundings.

156
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,010
- The dads have the babies
instead of the moms.

157
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,002
- [Jeremy] The dads carry it.

158
00:07:12,002 --> 00:07:15,169
(upbeat guitar music)

159
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,490
Let me touch the water.

160
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,660
- So some sharks lay eggs
and this is a shark egg.

161
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,930
This thing right here.

162
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,179
- [Jeremy] Wow, it looks like a shell.

163
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:37,070
(upbeat guitar music)

164
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,190
So Janae got a little wet out there

165
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,200
and we're trying to dry her off.

166
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,882
(upbeat music)

167
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:02,529
Good job.

168
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:03,950
Okay, try to make it.

169
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,360
This is the advanced level monkey bars.

170
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,193
Whoa!

171
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,863
(guitar music)

172
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,280
(laughter)

173
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,690
- So it's really chilly here at the park

174
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,919
and Elise comes running up to me.

175
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,949
She says Mom, I know it's
gonna make you smile.

176
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,309
And it sure did.

177
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,759
Do you guys see that rainbow?

178
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,144
- It's a rainbow.

179
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,930
- [Kendra] It's a birthday
rainbow for you big girl.

180
00:08:47,668 --> 00:08:48,870
- There's more of the rainbow, look!

181
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,848
- [Kendra] There's more of
the rainbow, you're right.

182
00:08:51,848 --> 00:08:54,431
(upbeat music)

183
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,730
They make cute little
shaped loves of bread.

184
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,060
These are sea turtles.

185
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,543
- Can I eat it?

186
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,880
- [Kendra] Yeah, it's a bread fish.

187
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,241
- [Jeremy] How cool.

188
00:09:08,241 --> 00:09:10,741
(jazzy music)

189
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,500
- So Laura requested
a strawberry ice cream

190
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,140
and white cake, ice cream
cake for her birthday.

191
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,754
So I'm here at Baskin Robbins
picking one up for her.

192
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:25,254
(jazzy music)

193
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,520
It's really convenient for me that my kids

194
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,470
like ice cream cakes
more than regular cakes

195
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,688
'cause we just pick them up and buy them.

196
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:37,779
And it's easier for me.

197
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:40,682
It's a strawberry and
vanilla ice cream cake.

198
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:41,515
- Are these stickers?

199
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:43,400
- [Kendra] They're not, they're rings.

200
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,231
- Can we take off?

201
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,460
- [Kendra] Yeah and
then you can wear them.

202
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,107
(piano music)

203
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,640
Oh can you look pretty like a princess?

204
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,890
(laughter)

205
00:09:55,798 --> 00:09:57,180
That is fantastic.

206
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,013
Oh yes.

207
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:02,950
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

208
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,033
(cheers)

209
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,664
(guitar music)

210
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,030
- [Jeremy] So how are you feeling

211
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,460
about going to bed tonight Laura?

212
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,484
- I'm sleeping in my tent.

213
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,170
- [Jeremy] You're gonna sleep in this?

214
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,670
Here, let's turn the light on.

215
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,180
And what are you gonna use for a blanket?

216
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,095
- This.

217
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,220
Goodnight J House out, it's my birthday.

218
00:10:31,557 --> 00:10:33,010
She's our teenager.

219
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
- [Kendra] Are you ready
for your next present?

220
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,383
Why do you look like you're 18?

221
00:10:38,383 --> 00:10:39,216
- Baking?

222
00:10:40,148 --> 00:10:41,410
Yay!

223
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,243
Sprite?

224
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:43,610
- [Jeremy] That's right.

225
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,990
- [Kendra] We found one more present.

226
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,080
We forgot about it.

227
00:10:48,089 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
