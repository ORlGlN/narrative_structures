00:00:00,353 --> 00:00:01,727
- I like coconut creme, it was good.

2
00:00:01,727 --> 00:00:02,935
- You like it?

3
00:00:02,935 --> 00:00:06,538
(yelling)
No, no, no!

4
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:08,823
- Hi, we're doing the
pie eating challenge.

5
00:00:08,823 --> 00:00:11,236
- And there's gummy worms in here.

6
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:12,092
- Pie.

7
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:13,938
- [Woman] Caleb, are you excited?

8
00:00:13,938 --> 00:00:15,963
What flavor is your pie?

9
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:17,230
- Chocolate.

10
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,472
- Chocolate.

11
00:00:18,472 --> 00:00:20,451
- Laura's is chocolate too.

12
00:00:20,451 --> 00:00:22,118
- [Man] Get set, go!

13
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:26,195
- Go Elise!

14
00:00:26,195 --> 00:00:27,112
- Go Isaac!

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,910
(laughter)

16
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:37,195
(squeaky fast forwarded voices)

17
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,151
- [Woman] She got it!

18
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,527
- Laura, stick your whole
face in there and lick it.

19
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:53,360
- No.

20
00:00:54,624 --> 00:00:55,457
Yummy.

21
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:59,961
(slow paced playful music)

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,691
- Laura, get your hand in there.

23
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:12,631
- No!

24
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,964
- Don't do this.

25
00:01:17,574 --> 00:01:21,574
(squeaky fast forwarded voices)

26
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,125
- In each of these big pies,
there are three gummy worms

27
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,505
and the first person to
find all three first wins.

28
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,977
So our question for you guys is,

29
00:01:30,977 --> 00:01:32,544
what is your favorite pie?

30
00:01:32,544 --> 00:01:34,188
Let us know in the comments below.

31
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:37,005
My favorite would have to be
apple or chocolate mousse.

32
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,580
- I'm gonna go with coconut creme pie.

33
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,580
Get set, go.

34
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:43,786
That's coconut.

35
00:01:43,786 --> 00:01:45,153
- Got one!

36
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:46,903
Mine's coconut creme.

37
00:01:47,853 --> 00:01:51,502
(squeaky fast forwarded voices)

38
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,752
(laughter)

39
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,465
- I got it!

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,708
You made it coconut creme for me.

41
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:07,541
- I did.

42
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,531
- I like coconut creme, it was good.

43
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:09,589
- You like it?

44
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,163
(yelling)
No, no, no!

45
00:02:12,163 --> 00:02:12,996
No, no!

46
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,926
(slow motion yelling)

47
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,737
- J House out.

48
00:02:22,998 --> 00:00:00,000
(children laughing)
