1
00:00:00,264 --> 00:00:01,349
(screaming)

2
00:00:01,349 --> 00:00:03,071
- [Kendra] Caleb's helping me paddle.

3
00:00:03,071 --> 00:00:05,212
(laughing)

4
00:00:05,212 --> 00:00:06,889
I'm a little bit nervous.

5
00:00:06,889 --> 00:00:09,280
The graceful dismount. (laughing)

6
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,917
- I got all dirty.

7
00:00:10,917 --> 00:00:12,799
- [Michael] Whoa, that's a pretty big one.

8
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,716
(bouncy pop music)

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,441
- [Jeremy] It's kinda cool out here, huh?

10
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:33,274
- Yeah.

11
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:35,396
- It's amazing how being
in a different landscape

12
00:00:35,396 --> 00:00:38,351
than what you're used
to is so awe inspiring.

13
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:39,631
Like to everyone who lives here,

14
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,811
it's like, yeah, it's
the lake, no big deal.

15
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:45,877
But to us, it's like, look at this lake.

16
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:47,377
This is beautiful.

17
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,532
Whoa, whoa, hey.

18
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,466
Try again.

19
00:00:55,466 --> 00:00:56,589
When you fall--

20
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:57,736
- [Kendra] This floor's slippery.

21
00:00:57,736 --> 00:00:59,486
- [Jeremy] Try again.

22
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:06,107
- I don't know how to play.

23
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:09,593
- So, the kids still haven't
adjusted to the time change.

24
00:01:09,593 --> 00:01:12,654
So, at 5 a.m., we were all up.

25
00:01:12,654 --> 00:01:15,189
We were like just snuggling
on the bed together.

26
00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:16,525
And we have a couple of hours where we're

27
00:01:16,525 --> 00:01:19,275
just like playing until
everybody else is awake

28
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:20,980
so we can go hang out with family.

29
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,397
It's kinda funny.

30
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:26,401
So, I'm not a coffee drinker.

31
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:28,763
I have never used one of these.

32
00:01:28,763 --> 00:01:29,810
I'm tryin' to figure it out because

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,933
they have some hot chocolate here

34
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,207
and that sounds kinda nice this morning.

35
00:01:33,207 --> 00:01:35,513
Who's the beautiful princess?

36
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:36,430
That's you.

37
00:01:37,405 --> 00:01:40,131
All right, mug I'm guessing goes here.

38
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:44,017
Looks like this, would it come
out the bottom or the top?

39
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:45,064
Does it go in this way?

40
00:01:45,064 --> 00:01:46,147
No, this way.

41
00:01:47,862 --> 00:01:49,859
All right, let's turn it on.

42
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,557
- Big kids think that I'm little.

43
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:55,068
- [Jeremy] Why would they
think something like that?

44
00:01:55,068 --> 00:01:57,808
- Because they think
that I'm gonna get hurt

45
00:01:57,808 --> 00:02:01,975
with the things, with the
toys that are in the garage.

46
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,081
So, they think I'm little.

47
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:09,693
- Do you wanna play with me out there?

48
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:11,646
Let's go play some games, okay?

49
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,168
- But first, I need my hair done.

50
00:02:13,168 --> 00:02:14,934
- Yeah, let's keep workin' on that.

51
00:02:14,934 --> 00:02:17,742
All right, Nae Nae, it
says it's ready to brew.

52
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:20,059
I'm tryin' to hit one of these buttons.

53
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:21,397
That's not really workin'.

54
00:02:21,397 --> 00:02:23,463
Let's do this one.

55
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:24,296
Go.

56
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:26,977
Nothing.

57
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:29,477
Hot chocolate, it's happening.

58
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:32,358
That's nice.

59
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:33,775
Should we try it?

60
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,950
That is super hot.

61
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,227
The sun is finally coming up.

62
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:47,132
We've only been up for
three or four hours already.

63
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:48,181
- We woke up at five.

64
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:51,155
- What do you see out there, Laura?

65
00:02:51,155 --> 00:02:52,572
- There's a lake.

66
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,773
- So, it's not raining right now,

67
00:02:57,773 --> 00:03:00,115
what'd you say we go kayaking on the lake?

68
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:04,216
- But, Dad, I know how
to go kayaking myself.

70
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:06,152
- [Jeremy] We're gonna go together.

71
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,668
- [Caleb] This is the coolest thing ever.

72
00:03:09,668 --> 00:03:13,001
(gentle acoustic music)

73
00:03:21,608 --> 00:03:23,433
Can it hold all of your legs?

74
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,604
- I don't know.

75
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:28,354
I don't know if this is
gonna work very well.

76
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:30,330
- [Caleb] Go.

77
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:35,026
(laughing)

78
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:36,109
- Okay, whoa.

79
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,829
This is just really, I mean,
I can't believe the water.

80
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,329
It's just perfect.

81
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,282
- [Kendra] And you didn't fall in, yet.

82
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,440
- We have to get out, too, right?

83
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,620
- [Kendra] Oh, that looks so fun.

84
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,634
Who wants a turn kayaking?

85
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:00,467
- Me.
- Me.

86
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,744
- Can I do it by myself?

87
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:02,920
- [Kendra] We have to get life jackets.

88
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,360
Can he get out?

89
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,928
- I'm gonna come to the side
just in case we lose it,

90
00:04:06,928 --> 00:04:09,081
it'll be a little bit easier.

91
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,549
- [Kendra] I'm a little bit nervous.

92
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:12,903
Good job, Isaac, good job.

93
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:14,668
(laughing)

94
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:15,647
- I'm all about grace.

95
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,346
- [Kendra] The graceful dismount.

96
00:04:17,346 --> 00:04:18,490
(laughing)

97
00:04:18,491 --> 00:04:19,880
- I mean, I could've stood up slowly

98
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,559
and done it, but I was just like, go safe

99
00:04:22,559 --> 00:04:26,042
and roll over to the side awkwardly.

100
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:29,542
(bouncy orchestral music)

101
00:04:35,485 --> 00:04:36,617
- [Caleb] Where do you wanna go?

102
00:04:36,617 --> 00:04:38,972
- [Kendra] That way, into the fog.

103
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:42,472
(bouncy orchestral music)

104
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,177
- [Jeremy] There they are.

105
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:49,495
- Good job, Caleb, I think
you're the kayaking man.

106
00:04:49,495 --> 00:04:52,834
- [Jeremy] He's doin' good, huh?

107
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,888
How was it, Caleb?

108
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:56,638
- It was fun, now I'm gonna go with Elise.

109
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:57,568
- Our entire trip

110
00:04:57,568 --> 00:04:59,651
(crying)

111
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:01,787
is worth it.

112
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:02,875
This is amazing.

113
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,139
We need to move here and live on a lake.

114
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,532
I would do this every single morning.

115
00:05:06,532 --> 00:05:07,549
This is amazing.

116
00:05:07,549 --> 00:05:09,304
- [Jeremy] Hopefully, it
doesn't rain every morning.

117
00:05:09,304 --> 00:05:10,950
- [Kendra] Look, there's some sun.

118
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:12,848
I see sunlight.

119
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:14,488
- [Caleb] There's the blue sky.

120
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,077
- [Jeremy] I'll hold the boat.

121
00:05:16,077 --> 00:05:18,881
All right, Elise, pull this out

122
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,881
without whackin' anyone.

123
00:05:22,266 --> 00:05:23,658
All right, Elise, you goin' in?

124
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,275
Wait, you gotta get a life jacket on.

125
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,649
She's in.

126
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,056
- Woo.

127
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,331
(laughing)

128
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,831
(bouncy orchestral music)

129
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:37,067
- Okay.

130
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,876
- One, two, three, four.

131
00:05:38,876 --> 00:05:40,876
bouncy orchestral music)

132
00:05:44,014 --> 00:05:44,866
- [Kendra] We're putting the kayaks up

133
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,489
but we're hoping there'll be another day

134
00:05:46,489 --> 00:05:48,754
when we can use them.

135
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:52,421
I'm gonna watch Jeremy
gracefully hang this.

136
00:05:55,114 --> 00:05:57,364
(laughing)

137
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:04,463
Nice.

138
00:06:04,463 --> 00:06:05,747
You made that look so easy.

139
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:08,927
- So, they had it the other
way, so water was getting in it.

140
00:06:08,927 --> 00:06:10,375
- Well, I've seen my family,

141
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,271
and I've kayaked on this amazing lake.

142
00:06:13,271 --> 00:06:14,300
My trip is made.

143
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,523
Everything after this is just bonus.

144
00:06:16,523 --> 00:06:17,990
And there's a lot of bonus coming.

145
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,403
Look at this view.

146
00:06:19,403 --> 00:06:21,172
This is amazing.

147
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,651
Did you wanna go out on the lake with me?

148
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:23,547
- No.

149
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:25,610
- [Kendra] Not today?

150
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,821
Maybe another day?

151
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,400
- Yeah, a short one.

152
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,299
- A short one.

153
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,936
So, we realized we never
actually introduced where we are.

154
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:36,037
So, in case you were
curious, we flew to Seattle,

155
00:06:36,037 --> 00:06:39,948
and we are north of the Seattle
area in a cabin on a lake.

156
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,818
And we're staying here,
it's a little rental house,

157
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,221
not too far from my
brother and his family.

158
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:45,917
And my whole family is coming into town

159
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:47,989
to have Thanksgiving
at my brother's house.

160
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:50,461
Today is a day that we get to
play here at the cabin a bit,

161
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:53,065
and then we're gonna go help
with some Thanksgiving prep.

162
00:06:53,065 --> 00:06:54,451
And then we're actually gonna host

163
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,855
a little get together
at this cabin tonight.

164
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:59,392
- [Jeremy] You guys, look at that.

165
00:06:59,392 --> 00:07:02,136
- [Kendra] This is the driveway

166
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:04,440
to the rental house we're staying in.

167
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,940
(bouncy orchestral music)

168
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,706
- Wave, oh, no, let's just wave.

169
00:07:14,706 --> 00:07:16,704
- [Caleb And Isaac] Hi.

170
00:07:16,704 --> 00:07:18,789
Hip, hip, hooray.

171
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:19,622
(laughing)

172
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:20,968
- We're on our way to my brother's house,

173
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:23,482
but first we're making a
stop to pick up some pies.

174
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:26,106
Snohomish Pie Company.

175
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:27,106
Let's do it.

176
00:07:30,846 --> 00:07:32,077
- Are we gonna have two pies?

177
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,719
- [Kendra] We're gonna have three pies.

178
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,416
- Three pies like me.

179
00:07:35,416 --> 00:07:36,871
- [Kendra] Okay, thank you.

180
00:07:36,871 --> 00:07:39,954
Now, home to make Thanksgiving rolls.

181
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:44,812
So, my awesome sister-in-law,
Melanie, is super organized.

182
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,824
She has everything planned out.

183
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,308
What people can eat at different times.

184
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:50,765
And this is the most
important, snack options.

185
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:53,208
- I'm probably like overly organized.

186
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:54,503
- No, it's a good thing.

187
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,000
We have like what, 20 people?

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,366
How many people are here?
- 21.

189
00:07:57,366 --> 00:07:58,950
- [Kendra] 21, so she's organized.

190
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,997
She's ready for us.

191
00:07:59,997 --> 00:08:01,380
A fully-stocked pantry.

192
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,428
(laughing)

193
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:04,464
Good job, what did you find?

194
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:05,645
- A Brookie.

195
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:07,452
- [Kendra] Those are available?

196
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,152
Where's the hiding spot?

197
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:11,325
- [Papa] They're not readily
visible to the munchkins.

198
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,827
- Brookies are the best dessert ever.

199
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,765
I'm definitely gonna be
checking some of those out.

200
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:19,348
It's so organized and
look, there's a menu.

201
00:08:26,324 --> 00:08:27,553
- [Grandma] Cut 'em across like this,

202
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:29,969
it's like a finger between
them 'cause they raise.

203
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,558
- When we decided to come
and spend Thanksgiving

204
00:08:31,558 --> 00:08:34,095
with my family, I was so
excited about these rolls.

205
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:35,510
These are my grandmom's recipe,

206
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,993
and my mom's made 'em every Thanksgiving

207
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:38,227
that I've ever had with her.

208
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,245
And I don't make them myself.

209
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:40,707
They're so much work and I'm scared

210
00:08:40,707 --> 00:08:41,984
that I'm not gonna get 'em right.

211
00:08:41,985 --> 00:08:43,345
I'm gonna have to learn someday,

212
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:45,071
but I'm glad my girls get to help Grandma.

213
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,454
- We're making these today, not tomorrow.

214
00:08:47,454 --> 00:08:49,220
- [Kendra] 'Cause they take so much time

215
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,380
that we're gettin' it done today

216
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,169
so we'll have more time to
do other stuff tomorrow.

217
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:53,762
- The other reason is,
is because the turkey

218
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:55,383
takes up the oven all day tomorrow.

219
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,040
- My mom was having all
the little girls help her,

220
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,491
and I'm like, I wanna do it.

221
00:08:58,491 --> 00:08:59,929
And my sister's like, me, too.

222
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:00,762
- I wanna do it.

223
00:09:00,762 --> 00:09:03,262
- So, we're in, we're helping.

224
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:07,015
- [Jeremy] Laura, what are you doin'?

225
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:08,449
- Making rolls.

226
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:09,766
- [Jeremy] You making rolls?

227
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,691
- You fold it down, and
then you fold it again,

228
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:13,987
and then you cut it.

229
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,518
You did it.

230
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:16,351
You made a roll.

231
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:17,562
- [Sister] Oh, that's gonna be so yummy.

232
00:09:17,562 --> 00:09:20,141
- Now, we cut it and and
then you hand it to Grandma.

233
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:22,308
You can work on that side.

234
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:25,390
In the comments below, I want to hear

235
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,719
about a family recipe
that's in your family.

236
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:30,243
Something that's amazing and just it feels

237
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:32,188
like family to you, let us know.

238
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,850
- I got all dirty.

239
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,983
- [Kendra] Dirty, did you
get flour all over you?

240
00:09:35,983 --> 00:09:37,315
Thanks for helpin', big girl.

241
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:39,249
You gonna go wash your hands?

242
00:09:39,249 --> 00:09:42,166
Now, we have to let the rolls rise.

243
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:43,917
Yum.

244
00:09:47,577 --> 00:09:48,650
- So, we're just going on a little tour

245
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:50,355
around Michael's house.

246
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,272
They live in such a beautiful area.

247
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:56,630
- Do you wanna see, look,
here's our back yard, Laura.

248
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,352
We're gonna go down there in a minute.

249
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:59,185
- We are?

250
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:00,018
- [Michael] Uh huh.

251
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:00,994
- [Elise] Are we allowed to go catch it?

252
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,008
- [Michael] I don't know
exactly where it is,

253
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:06,086
but we hear frogs out here all the time.

254
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:08,204
- This is a trail, too?

255
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,529
- It's a trail right by his house.

256
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,696
(bouncy guitar music)

257
00:10:15,726 --> 00:10:17,706
So, that's Michael's house right there.

258
00:10:17,706 --> 00:10:20,100
And they have this path back in the woods.

259
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,081
He said that there's blackberry bushes

260
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,066
right along here where they
can come and pick blackberries.

261
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,586
- You see all these little
pine cones all over the ground?

262
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,324
Which trees do you think these come from?

263
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:31,748
Is it a little tree or a big tree?

264
00:10:31,748 --> 00:10:32,718
- A big tree.

265
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,377
- Yeah, it's from this
big one right above us.

266
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:36,960
They make these little tiny pine cones.

267
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,073
- [Jeremy] These are big maple leaves.

268
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,835
Let's see who can get the biggest one.

269
00:10:40,835 --> 00:10:43,221
- [Caleb] I think I got it.

270
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:44,533
- [Jeremy] That's pretty big.

271
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:45,813
- [Elise] Look at mine.

272
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,517
- [Jeremy] Oh, that one's big.

273
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:48,350
- [Elise] Look at mine.

274
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,970
- [Michael] Whoa, that's a pretty big one.

275
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,517
- [Jeremy] Did you get
some mud on your bum?

276
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,981
What happened?

277
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,926
- Well, I fell.
- You slipped?

278
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,511
- Well, I wanna see it.

279
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,562
Oh wow.

280
00:10:58,562 --> 00:10:59,645
- It's pretty dirty.

281
00:10:59,645 --> 00:11:01,636
- They had a greasy tree.

282
00:11:01,636 --> 00:11:03,075
- [Kendra] Did they have greasy trees?

283
00:11:03,075 --> 00:11:05,124
- Yes, it was all green.

284
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:07,713
- [Kendra] Yeah, is it green
stuff growing on the tree?

285
00:11:07,713 --> 00:11:08,546
- Yeah.

286
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,065
- [Kendra] That's called moss.

287
00:11:10,065 --> 00:11:11,898
- Oh, moss, it's moss.

288
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:15,353
- Check out the moss on that tree.

289
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:17,043
We had an awesome time
at my brother's house.

290
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,427
We're now bringing the whole gang back

291
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,409
to the lake cabin for some fun there.

292
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:23,909
(bouncy orchestral music)

293
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,462
The sounds from the game room tell me

294
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:31,619
there's something awesome
going on in there.

295
00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:34,058
What in the world is going on out here?

296
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:35,679
- We're playing rock.

297
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,365
- [Kendra] Rock? I don't know this game.

298
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,834
- It stopped.

299
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:41,187
- Yeah, we're just figuring out right now.

300
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:42,589
We've adapted it to
make it a little easier,

301
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:43,846
'cause it's slick in here.

302
00:11:43,846 --> 00:11:45,403
- Yeah, so we're modifying it.

303
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:46,494
- [Kendra] Keeping it safe?

304
00:11:46,494 --> 00:11:47,894
Who all knew this game?

305
00:11:47,894 --> 00:11:50,006
- My brother is, I
called Jeff, my brother,

306
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:53,455
and I'm like, hey, how do you play rock?

307
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,455
- Hi, the rest of the party arrives.

308
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:01,340
(bouncy guitar music)

309
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,936
So, the forecast for while
we're here shows rain

310
00:12:03,936 --> 00:12:05,219
pretty much all day every day.

311
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,039
So, even though it's kind of drizzling,

312
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,627
we decided to venture
out and try the boats

313
00:12:08,627 --> 00:12:11,161
because I absolutely love kayaking.

314
00:12:11,161 --> 00:12:13,441
And kayaking right here on the lake,

315
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,287
oh, it's just gorgeous.

316
00:12:15,287 --> 00:12:17,611
Jeremy's trying to get the
water out of this other kayak.

317
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,462
- There's just a little bit left.

318
00:12:20,462 --> 00:12:23,545
- [Kendra] Isaac's going out with me.

319
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,351
- [Jeremy] Do you want
me to give you a push?

320
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:28,047
- Yeah.
- Goodbye, my son.

321
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:30,297
(laughing)

322
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:33,608
- [Kendra] There he is, oh my goodness.

323
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,416
- [Jeremy] There he is.

324
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,749
- So, we have to vlog my graceful entry.

325
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,532
- [Jeremy] Goodbye.

326
00:12:41,532 --> 00:12:43,627
(laughing)

327
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:44,707
- Okay.

328
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,188
Oh, thanks, I do want my oar.

329
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,300
Are you comin' with me, buddy?

330
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,659
- [Jeremy] You wanna hop in the front?

331
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:50,492
- [Caleb] Sure.

332
00:12:50,492 --> 00:12:53,826
- You gotta go right into the very center

333
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:55,179
so we don't tip over.

334
00:12:55,179 --> 00:12:56,012
Ready?

335
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:58,107
I'm loving seeing all these pretty houses

336
00:12:58,107 --> 00:12:59,842
right along the water.

337
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:00,799
How's it goin'?

338
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,916
- Good.

339
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:03,756
- Stay close, okay, dude?

340
00:13:03,756 --> 00:13:05,311
Caleb's helping me paddle.

341
00:13:05,311 --> 00:13:07,443
(laughing)

342
00:13:07,443 --> 00:13:10,501
Luckily, kayaks are
kind of hard to capsize.

343
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:12,584
I'm gettin' a little wet.

344
00:13:15,894 --> 00:13:17,146
This is so beautiful.

345
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:20,137
I've never really been outdoors
up here in the Northwest.

346
00:13:20,137 --> 00:13:21,548
And it is breathtaking.

347
00:13:21,548 --> 00:13:22,905
I can't wait to come back.

348
00:13:22,905 --> 00:13:24,659
We need to come in the summer time.

349
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:25,660
That would be amazing.

350
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,451
All right, Isaac, time to turn
around, it's Lisie's turn.

351
00:13:28,451 --> 00:13:29,973
All right, Caleb, can you paddle us home?

352
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:31,618
- Yep.

353
00:13:31,618 --> 00:13:32,904
- Good job, is it hard?

354
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:33,898
- Yep.

355
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:35,578
- [Kendra] We're goin' in
a little bit of a circle.

356
00:13:35,578 --> 00:13:36,752
- Okay.

357
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,459
- You're fixin' it, good job, buddy.

358
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,892
Lisie joined us, she's back
there learning how to kayak.

359
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:43,112
Come this way, Lisie.

360
00:13:43,112 --> 00:13:44,148
She's gettin' the hang of it.

361
00:13:44,148 --> 00:13:45,313
She pulled ahead of us.

362
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:47,949
Oh, I think we're gonna bump into you.

363
00:13:47,949 --> 00:13:50,155
Ah, bumper boats.

364
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,607
(laughing)

365
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:52,892
Good save.

366
00:13:52,892 --> 00:13:56,179
Poll question, have you been
to the Pacific Northwest?

367
00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:58,030
My family is here and it's not raining,

368
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,568
so we're taking another
moment to get out on the lake.

369
00:14:00,568 --> 00:14:02,129
We dried off the paddle boat.

370
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,799
So, some of the boys
are headin' out on that.

371
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:05,027
Look at that grin.

372
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:07,244
- This thing's pretty efficient, actually.

373
00:14:07,244 --> 00:14:08,204
- [Kendra] All right.

374
00:14:08,204 --> 00:14:09,787
- My legs are tired, honestly.

375
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:10,656
- Yeah.
- Already.

376
00:14:10,656 --> 00:14:15,244
- I think the kayak's might
have a slight edge on us.

377
00:14:15,244 --> 00:14:18,008
(laughing)

378
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:19,766
- This is really tiring.

379
00:14:19,766 --> 00:14:21,472
And you don't go very fast.

380
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:23,605
Like in the kayak, you can really move.

381
00:14:23,605 --> 00:14:27,312
- The water sure is nice, but it's cold.

382
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:28,259
- [Jeremy] It is cold.

383
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:29,448
- [Kendra] Are you sinking?

384
00:14:29,448 --> 00:14:31,811
- I know I weigh a
little bit more than Sam,

385
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,957
so the water's coming in on my side.

386
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:34,938
- [Kendra] We're thinking
maybe there's a plug

387
00:14:34,938 --> 00:14:35,899
that we don't know about.

388
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:36,857
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

389
00:14:36,857 --> 00:14:38,136
- Let's see what we can do.

390
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:39,865
Papa fixed the paddle boat.

391
00:14:39,865 --> 00:14:41,279
He found the problem and we fixed it

392
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,846
as soon as we got it out of the water.

393
00:14:42,846 --> 00:14:46,383
- There was a rubber gasket
problem that needed tightening.

394
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:48,277
- [Kendra] And Papa saved the day.

395
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:49,668
- It had an interface issue.

396
00:14:49,668 --> 00:14:50,639
(laughing)

397
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,220
- [Kendra] Papa's the
next one headin' out.

398
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,053
Whoa, don't fall over.

399
00:14:59,055 --> 00:14:59,888
- Whoa.
(screams)

400
00:14:59,888 --> 00:15:01,300
(laughing)

401
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,453
- Whoa.
(screams)

402
00:15:02,453 --> 00:15:05,334
(laughing)

403
00:15:05,334 --> 00:15:07,151
- [Jeremy] Do you like
hanging out with Uncle Jimmy?

404
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:07,984
- Yeah.

405
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:11,957
(laughing)

406
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:15,531
- [Jeremy] Whoops-a-daisies.

407
00:15:15,531 --> 00:15:16,781
Ooh, good shot.

408
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,650
They did a puzzle.

409
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:26,275
- When you land on that one.

410
00:15:28,125 --> 00:15:30,611
- [Laura] Goodnight to yourself.

411
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:32,778
(singing)

412
00:15:34,118 --> 00:15:35,416
- We're pulling up to the airport.

413
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,024
(crying)

414
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,941
(bouncy pop music)

415
00:15:42,576 --> 00:00:00,000
(laughing)
