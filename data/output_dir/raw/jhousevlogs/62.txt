1
00:00:00,238 --> 00:00:01,071
- Hi!

2
00:00:01,071 --> 00:00:02,059
- [Mom] Hi! (laughs)

3
00:00:02,059 --> 00:00:02,897
Did you have fun with the stickers?

4
00:00:02,897 --> 00:00:03,946
- Yep.

5
00:00:03,946 --> 00:00:06,446
(banjo music)

6
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,321
- [Dad] You guys tryin'
to eat the bubbles?

7
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,200
- [Mom] This is low and high
and off, but then there's also

8
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,294
numbers on here, so I have no idea.

9
00:00:16,294 --> 00:00:19,377
So this is our new family read aloud.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,038
- [Dad] So even though we
went to bed really late

11
00:00:24,038 --> 00:00:27,354
last night, the kids are still
in their Kansas City time.

12
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:30,521
And so they were up long before the sun,

13
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:32,787
I think it was like 5
AM, so we've unpacked,

14
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:36,010
we're getting ready for
the day bright and early.

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:38,760
(soothing music)

16
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:42,412
- [Dad] Alright, so what do
you notice about the roses?

17
00:00:42,412 --> 00:00:44,177
Take a close look.

18
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,099
- They're prickly?

19
00:00:45,099 --> 00:00:47,798
- [Dad] They are prickly, do
you guys see all the thorns?

20
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:48,846
- Why?

21
00:00:48,846 --> 00:00:51,025
- [Dad] But, can you smell one Laura?

22
00:00:51,025 --> 00:00:52,510
Smell what the rose smells like.

23
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,455
- [Isaac] Don't prick your nose.

24
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:56,898
- [Dad] Smells good, huh?

25
00:00:56,898 --> 00:01:00,148
(relaxing piano music)

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,136
- So this courtyard is
awesome, all the kids are in

27
00:01:24,136 --> 00:01:26,940
the courtyard and I look up
and I'm like, where's Janae?

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,481
Are you wishing you were outside, too?

29
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:31,095
There they are!

30
00:01:31,095 --> 00:01:32,369
Hi!

31
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:33,202
- Hi!

32
00:01:33,202 --> 00:01:35,148
- [Mom] Hi! (laughs)

33
00:01:35,148 --> 00:01:37,072
- [Janae] (baby gibberish)

34
00:01:37,072 --> 00:01:40,611
- [Mom] I know, they're
all out there being crazy.

35
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:43,279
- So the boys were playing
football out here and they lost

36
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:45,388
the ball down the hill.

37
00:01:45,388 --> 00:01:46,763
Oh, it's way down there.

38
00:01:46,763 --> 00:01:48,243
So there's a little path
down there, I'm gonna see

39
00:01:48,243 --> 00:01:50,243
if there's a way down to the path.

40
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:53,260
(uplifting music)

41
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,093
I'm trying to do this.

42
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:00,666
Got it!

43
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:03,478
I remember as a kid playing
with my brothers, we were always

44
00:02:03,478 --> 00:02:05,412
losing the ball over the fence.

45
00:02:05,412 --> 00:02:06,644
We didn't have to climb
down a big hill though

46
00:02:06,644 --> 00:02:07,556
to get it most of the time,

47
00:02:07,556 --> 00:02:09,394
we just had to like ask
our neighbor for it.

48
00:02:09,394 --> 00:02:11,793
- This house we're staying
at is full of these cute

49
00:02:11,793 --> 00:02:13,294
little things I keep discovering.

50
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:17,401
The door knocker on this
door is a couple kissing.

51
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:19,701
(knocking)

52
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:20,618
- [Dad] Go!

53
00:02:26,066 --> 00:02:27,149
Over the top.

54
00:02:28,692 --> 00:02:30,942
(laughter)

55
00:02:33,157 --> 00:02:35,624
- Rebounds-and-sist so he did do it all.

56
00:02:35,624 --> 00:02:37,041
- [Dad] Were you recording?

57
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,708
- Yeah, I didn't drop it at all.

58
00:02:44,554 --> 00:02:47,804
(relaxing piano music)

59
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,799
I keep on catching the bubbles.

60
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,882
- [Dad] Nae-nae, look at the bubbles!

61
00:02:58,927 --> 00:03:00,260
Good job, Laura.

62
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:05,293
- Ahhhh!

63
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,876
- [Dad] You guys tryin'
to eat the bubbles?

64
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:15,460
- [Isaac] Oh, look at that one!

65
00:03:17,272 --> 00:03:19,210
- [Dad] We're really happy,
they had a little booster

66
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,407
seat here for Nae-nae
so she can sit up with

67
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:25,080
all the rest, which
makes her the most happy.

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,077
- Well you guys are gonna think I'm crazy,

69
00:03:26,077 --> 00:03:28,246
because I think I'm a little
crazy, but I literally packed

70
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:30,645
my blender and brought
it with us on our trip.

71
00:03:30,645 --> 00:03:32,805
Because I love my morning
smoothies so much, and I didn't

72
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:36,412
know if the rental place
would have a smoothie blender.

73
00:03:36,412 --> 00:03:37,569
That's what those things are called.

74
00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:39,794
Anyway, and I like to be
able to put lots of veggies

75
00:03:39,794 --> 00:03:44,084
in it, so I'm excited to
use it while I'm here.

76
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:45,597
- [Dad] So I know long term
we're gonna have to teach

77
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:47,965
Janae that she can't rest
her foot on the table,

78
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:51,325
but it's pretty adorable right now.

79
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,210
- [Mom] This girl makes us so happy.

80
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:56,439
(upbeat music)

81
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,189
How are you, are you
inspired by Dad's moves?

82
00:04:02,652 --> 00:04:05,985
Yeah it is, this kitchen is for dancing.

83
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:11,415
Show 'em how it's done, Nae-nae!

84
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:14,548
- [Janae] (baby talk)

85
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:17,715
- [Mom] What do you have in your hand?

86
00:04:18,898 --> 00:04:19,789
What is it?

87
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:20,711
- Swimsuit.

88
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,901
- [Mom] Why'd you bring your swimsuit?

89
00:04:21,901 --> 00:04:23,824
- Because, just in case I need it since

90
00:04:23,824 --> 00:04:25,817
we're going to the beach.

91
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:28,279
- [Mom] Well, we're
actually going to Walmart.

92
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:31,305
- We are actually go to Walmart.

93
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:33,193
- [Mom] Maybe, baby.

94
00:04:33,193 --> 00:04:34,455
Kay, go get in the car.

95
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:37,013
Laura has been so cute
here, she is so excited.

96
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:38,713
The very first thing she
did this morning was put

97
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:41,324
on her swimsuit, it was
like 5:30 AM and she put her

98
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:42,803
jacket on on top of it because
she's like, "It's cold,

99
00:04:42,803 --> 00:04:45,132
but I need to be ready for the beach".

100
00:04:45,132 --> 00:04:47,027
And then, we're getting ready
to go to Walmart, and I look

101
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:50,268
down and she's got her bathing
suit stuck under her arm.

102
00:04:50,268 --> 00:04:52,122
I'm like, what are you
doing, and she says,

103
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,541
"I'm bringing my swimsuit", I'm like why?

104
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,846
She's like, "Just in case
I need it, just in case

105
00:04:55,846 --> 00:04:58,227
we end up at the beach, you
always want to be prepared Mom."

106
00:04:58,227 --> 00:04:59,714
I afraid she's really going
to be disappointed when

107
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:02,889
we actually go to the beach
and she realizes it's freezing.

108
00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:05,137
We brought our swimsuits so
we could go to some pools

109
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,304
that are in the area, I
don't expect the kids to swim

110
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:10,527
in the ocean, so she
might have a different

111
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,083
idea about that than I do.

112
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:14,841
(upbeat music)

113
00:05:14,841 --> 00:05:17,478
So we're driving to Walmart
and all yesterday evening

114
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:19,996
and all this morning, I worked
on the list of what we need.

115
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:22,014
Because I didn't pay attention
to like what's already

116
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:25,315
at the rental house, what we're
gonna need, and guess what?

117
00:05:25,315 --> 00:05:28,209
We're on the way to Walmart,
we're almost there, and I

118
00:05:28,209 --> 00:05:32,009
don't have the list, and I
was really bummed about that,

119
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:33,548
and then I said it out loud, and then...

120
00:05:33,548 --> 00:05:34,595
- I have the list!

121
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:35,738
- Isn't it amazing?

122
00:05:35,738 --> 00:05:37,282
He's like, "Oh, I saw it
on the counter and I just

123
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,392
grabbed it", and I'm like, I'm so glad.

124
00:05:39,392 --> 00:05:41,839
- [Dad] Do you know what exit I'm taking?

125
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:43,326
- No, but it might be...

126
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:44,159
- [Dad] We just missed it.

127
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,985
- Yeah, don't go out
when you don't know where

128
00:05:45,985 --> 00:05:47,578
you're driving guys, you
might miss your exit.

129
00:05:47,578 --> 00:05:50,279
It's working out just fine,
we just had to make a U-turn.

130
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,834
- It's hard when you're in a
new place, like yesterday we

131
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:57,001
missed a turn, and it was 25
to 30 minutes to get back.

132
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,424
- When you're in a new place,
like their roads are laid out

133
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,135
differently, like where we
would expect things to be

134
00:06:03,135 --> 00:06:06,266
on the left, sometimes
they're on the right.

135
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:08,668
- We were driving up and
there was covered parking for

136
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,975
the Walmart, we thought that
was pretty cool, and as we got

137
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:14,585
underneath it we saw that
they're solar panels.

138
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:15,911
- Whaaaaaaat?

139
00:06:15,911 --> 00:06:16,744
- [Dad] That's pretty cool.

140
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:17,635
- That is really cool.

141
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:20,218
(upbeat music)

142
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:25,451
- Let's just say that shopping
with five over tired kids

143
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,534
is not, not a great play.

144
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:31,769
Does that pen look like
a microphone to you?

145
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,936
- Guess what, he has hair!

146
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,147
- [Mom] Kids are so excited,

147
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,997
there's an airplane dragging a banner.

148
00:06:40,997 --> 00:06:42,407
- [Dad] Was it really close to us before?

149
00:06:42,407 --> 00:06:44,768
- Yeah, he was like right there.

150
00:06:44,768 --> 00:06:46,770
- It's a plane dragging a banner.

151
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,603
- [Dad] Isn't that cool?

152
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:48,436
- Yeah.

153
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:52,123
(relaxing music)

154
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,351
- So the kids are out back
eating, and Kendra and I are

155
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:01,459
enjoying some alone time here
in the courtyard eating lunch.

156
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:04,238
Soup and salad, and Pringles.

157
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:05,612
Only the finest.

158
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:08,026
- Hopefully this is the last
store that we have to go to for

159
00:07:08,026 --> 00:07:10,250
a couple of days, but we're
trying to get kind of everything

160
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,192
set up and organized for our time here.

161
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:14,220
So the girls and I are
headed to Trader Joe's.

162
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,061
The boys are watching Janae
and watching football.

163
00:07:18,061 --> 00:07:18,894
- Hike!

164
00:07:21,654 --> 00:07:24,071
- [Dad] Nice, good play.

165
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,854
- I'm a quarterback.

166
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:27,124
- [Dad] Quarterback Caleb.

167
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:29,624
(funky music)

168
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,352
- [Dad] Nice, perfect throw!

169
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:55,412
There he is, woo-hoo!

170
00:07:57,782 --> 00:08:00,370
- So we don't have Trader
Joe's in our county,

171
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,517
so this is a real treat.

172
00:08:01,517 --> 00:08:03,620
I've heard of Trader Joe's, I
don't think I've been in it,

173
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,844
except maybe once like a decade ago,

174
00:08:05,844 --> 00:08:07,688
so I'm excited to see what they have.

175
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,271
(upbeat music)

176
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,378
Well we got some yummy food
now, it's home to try out

177
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:17,528
the grill for the first time.

178
00:08:17,528 --> 00:08:18,839
What do you think of Trader Joe's?

179
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,539
- I like it.

180
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:21,372
- [Mom] Did you have
fun with the stickers?

181
00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:22,205
- Yep!

182
00:08:22,205 --> 00:08:23,421
- We're using the grill
for the first time.

183
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:25,843
Jeremy's cookin' dinner,
we are having sliders.

184
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:27,342
- [Dad] I'm excited.

185
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:28,950
- [Mom] Me too, they're gonna be yummy!

186
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:29,783
What are you doing, Isaac?

187
00:08:29,783 --> 00:08:32,702
- We're watching the game and
going out and playing what

188
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,352
they did in the game, and then we're

189
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:35,948
just doing the normal play.

190
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,038
- [Mom] Got it, so you're doing the plays

191
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,871
they're doing in the game.

192
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:38,704
- Yeah.

193
00:08:38,705 --> 00:08:39,538
- [Mom] That's awesome.

194
00:08:39,538 --> 00:08:41,371
- Yes, I didn't go up!

195
00:08:42,717 --> 00:08:43,550
Your turn

196
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:46,575
- Two yellows.

197
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,361
- So this is my first time
cooking dinner in here,

198
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:55,215
so I'm just trying to find
like the right utensils to use

199
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,683
with everything, and
I'm trying to figure out

200
00:08:57,683 --> 00:08:59,682
how the oven works.

201
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,357
So the stove really has
me baffled right now,

202
00:09:01,357 --> 00:09:03,959
I'm sauteing some mushrooms
for our sliders and I can't

203
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,686
figure out if I have the heat
on high, or not super high.

204
00:09:08,686 --> 00:09:11,423
There's markers for low to high.

205
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,644
See, it says low and high and
off, but then there's also

206
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:16,451
numbers on here, so I have no idea.

207
00:09:16,451 --> 00:09:20,618
I think I have it on pretty
high, but I'm so confused.

208
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:27,252
Dinner is served, sliders with fixin's,

209
00:09:27,252 --> 00:09:28,840
and these are garlic fries.

210
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,673
- [Dad] Looks good.

211
00:09:29,673 --> 00:09:32,372
- [Mom] First dinner
in the new dining room.

212
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,332
- Hi!

213
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:37,670
- My favorite part of the day
was trying to go shopping.

214
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,070
- Alright, let's pray.

215
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,378
- [Mom] Alright guys, what time is it?

216
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:43,176
No, not actually what time is
it, like what are we doing?

217
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:45,645
- We're reading our read aloud book.

218
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:47,446
- [Mom] We're starting a new read aloud.

219
00:09:47,446 --> 00:09:51,062
And because of the time
change, we are all very tired.

220
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,558
Take care of me, be a doll.

221
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:57,218
- It's been a long day, let's go to bed.

222
00:09:57,218 --> 00:09:59,599
- [Mom] So this is our
new family read aloud,

223
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,482
it's a gold rush adventure.

224
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:04,232
- [Both] J House Out!

225
00:10:05,196 --> 00:10:06,712
- [Dad] Basketball on skates?

226
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:09,295
(upbeat music)

227
00:10:17,058 --> 00:10:19,660
- We've got food, and we
are somewhere fun, and it's

228
00:10:19,660 --> 00:00:00,000
gonna be bedtime any minute!
