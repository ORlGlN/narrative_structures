1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:00,833 --> 00:00:01,666
- Behhh!

3
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:02,802
- [Kendra] Is this your magic wands?

4
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:03,635
- Yep.

5
00:00:03,635 --> 00:00:05,018
Good sticks chose us.

6
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:05,851
It's not very bad.

7
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:07,298
- [Kendra] What in the world!

8
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,338
I've never seen this before!

9
00:00:09,338 --> 00:00:11,588
Oh, they're goin' that way.

10
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:17,688
Girls are coloring this morning.

11
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:19,392
What are you drawing Laura?

12
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:20,225
- My Mom book.

13
00:00:20,225 --> 00:00:21,478
- [Kendra] Are you drawing Moana?

14
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:22,311
- Yep.

15
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:23,144
- [Kendra] Elise, what are you workin' on?

16
00:00:23,144 --> 00:00:24,760
- I don't know, I might just do a ton

17
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,677
of squares that might fill.

18
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:26,510
- [Kendra] Mmhm.

19
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,825
- Like a different shapes
that would filled up

20
00:00:28,825 --> 00:00:30,683
in the squares, with colors.

21
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:32,008
- [Kendra] It's kind of different

22
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:33,340
to draw on graph paper, huh?

23
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,350
- [Elise] Uh huh.

24
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,410
- Well, enjoy seeing
what you come up with.

25
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,743
So Laura designed this
little necklace today.

26
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:40,655
It's cute.

27
00:00:40,655 --> 00:00:43,113
So obviously, I haven't
gotten ready yet this morning

28
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:44,315
but Laura came up to me this morning

29
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:47,120
and she said Mom, I
wanna look fabulous today

30
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,398
and she like did her little necklace,

31
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,493
and she picked out her outfit.

32
00:00:50,493 --> 00:00:51,490
It's just so cute.

33
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,295
So miss Laura wanted this little tie

34
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,775
on her outfit today.

35
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:57,162
- 'Cause I wanted to look pretty!

36
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,700
- [Kendra] Well you do look very nice.

37
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,935
Can I see the one in the back?

38
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,528
Turn around, there it is.

39
00:01:02,528 --> 00:01:03,827
She's got one in the back.

40
00:01:03,827 --> 00:01:05,065
What in the world!

41
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,555
I've never seen this before!

42
00:01:06,555 --> 00:01:07,396
(babbling)

43
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:09,645
- [Kendra] She is totally standing up!

44
00:01:09,645 --> 00:01:13,082
- [Laura] Yeah, we watchin' standing up!

45
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:15,767
- [Kendra] Is she standing up?

46
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,635
Janae, you did it.

47
00:01:17,635 --> 00:01:18,468
You did it!

48
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:19,378
You're standing up.

49
00:01:19,378 --> 00:01:21,007
- She's standing up.
- She's standing up in

50
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:21,840
no time.

51
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,340
- [Jeremy] She's standin'.

52
00:01:26,196 --> 00:01:27,472
She's standin'.

53
00:01:27,472 --> 00:01:29,638
(laughs)

54
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:30,888
Oooh, you okay?

55
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,920
You are a stander upper.

56
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,675
She's like, I just wanna
stand back up again.

57
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:39,095
Such a big girl.

58
00:01:39,095 --> 00:01:41,678
(upbeat music)

59
00:01:48,135 --> 00:01:48,968
Nice!

60
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,063
- Made it!

61
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:54,313
(laughing)

62
00:02:01,492 --> 00:02:03,242
- Go Isaac, go Isaac!

63
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:09,517
- [Kendra] Jeremy doesn't know
I'm filming him right now.

64
00:02:09,517 --> 00:02:11,867
He's trying to just put the tree limb

65
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:14,207
in the woods, which is not a bad idea

66
00:02:14,207 --> 00:02:15,820
as long as he doesn't get poison ivy.

67
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,261
What we really need is a ladder

68
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:21,752
and a chain saw, so that
we can just cut it down.

69
00:02:21,752 --> 00:02:23,585
He's so cute in there.

70
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,155
You're so cute!

71
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,207
- Go team.

72
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:30,622
- [Kendra] Watch out for poison ivy.

73
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:31,978
- A wand a cadabra,

74
00:02:31,978 --> 00:02:32,811
a wand a cadabra
- Push (mumbles).

75
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,423
- [Kendra] Is this your magic wands?

76
00:02:34,423 --> 00:02:35,256
- Yep.

77
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,895
Good sticks chose us.

78
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:38,645
- [Kendra] Oooh, very interesting.

79
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:41,958
Hey Caleb, you need a wand
for your Halloween costume.

80
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,098
Can that be your wand?

81
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:45,975
- We need to carve it and paint it.

82
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,390
- [Kendra] How 'bout we
just nave it be a stick?

83
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,223
- No.

84
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:50,640
- [Kendra] That would be so much easier!

85
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,650
- No, lets carve it and paint it.

86
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,462
- I think, even Harry's
would just look like a stick.

87
00:02:55,462 --> 00:02:59,292
- [Kendra] You can use a
real stick that chose you!

88
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,415
- No.

89
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:01,248
- Dang it.
- (laughing)

90
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,081
Dang it.

91
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,914
(laughing)

92
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:03,747
- [Kendra] The kids are playing one

93
00:03:03,747 --> 00:03:04,682
of their favorite games.

94
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:06,015
Catching leaves.

95
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,725
When the wind blows, they get a big gust

96
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:09,808
of the leaves

97
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:12,885
and they try to catch them in air

98
00:03:12,885 --> 00:03:13,995
before they hit the ground.

99
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:15,335
Get it Elise, get it!

100
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,643
Oh, so close.

101
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:18,243
It's like catching a snowflake

102
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,712
on your tongue, except for much harder.

103
00:03:20,712 --> 00:03:22,375
Oh, they're goin' that way!

104
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,505
(laughing)

105
00:03:23,505 --> 00:03:25,492
Oh, Oh, Isaac, that was so close!

106
00:03:25,492 --> 00:03:26,325
- Ah!

107
00:03:26,325 --> 00:03:27,158
- [Kendra] Oh!

108
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:27,991
(laughing and screaming)

109
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:28,824
So close.

110
00:03:30,884 --> 00:03:32,823
Here comes, here comes.

111
00:03:32,823 --> 00:03:34,280
- [Elise] Oh, there's two!

112
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,456
- [Kendra] Here comes, oh,
get it, get it, get it!

113
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:40,523
The kids are cleaning up the big sticks

114
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:44,273
that have fallen down
so that Jeremy can mow.

115
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:52,029
(tapping)

116
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:54,163
(laughing)

117
00:03:54,163 --> 00:03:56,641
Did you find Daddy out there?

118
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:59,556
(laughing)

119
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:00,745
(baby laughing)

120
00:04:00,745 --> 00:04:03,995
(tapping and knocking)

121
00:04:07,733 --> 00:04:09,983
(laughing)

122
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,424
- [Laura] Boo!

123
00:04:15,424 --> 00:04:17,745
(laughing)

124
00:04:17,745 --> 00:04:20,161
- Janae is so beautiful.

125
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:21,481
I love her so much.

126
00:04:21,481 --> 00:04:23,481
- [Kendra] Who was that?

127
00:04:24,468 --> 00:04:25,870
(squeals)
- Daddy.

128
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,933
(laughing)

129
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,218
- [Kendra] She's like, where'd it go?

130
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:30,053
- [Laura] Where'd he go?

131
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:32,666
- [Kendra] Oh, do you hear that?

132
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,548
That's the mower!

133
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,798
Oh my goodness!

134
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:38,728
You are standing up!

135
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:39,561
- Yeah!

136
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:41,208
- [Kendra] Are you so proud of her?

137
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,041
- Yeah!

138
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:45,518
(upbeat music)

139
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:59,238
- So we have a severe
thunderstorm warning going

140
00:04:59,238 --> 00:05:00,071
on right now.

141
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,860
It's still sunny but the
clouds are comin' in.

142
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,948
Hopefully it's not too bad.

143
00:05:04,948 --> 00:05:06,236
What're you guys doin'?

144
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,528
- Playing Harry Potter.

145
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:08,405
- Yeah!

146
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:09,885
I'm the big sister now.

147
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:11,088
- She's her (mumbles).

148
00:05:11,088 --> 00:05:12,038
- Yeah!

149
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:13,760
I'm (mumbles).
- I'm (mumbles).

150
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,691
- [Jeremy] Cool.

151
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:15,546
- She's Ginny.

152
00:05:15,546 --> 00:05:18,668
- And my sister died for a few weeks.

153
00:05:18,668 --> 00:05:20,618
It's just hertend.

154
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:21,546
- [Jeremy] Oh, just pretend?

155
00:05:21,546 --> 00:05:23,068
Will she come back to life?

156
00:05:23,068 --> 00:05:24,108
- No.

157
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,025
- Oh, okay.

158
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:27,446
Lunchtime!

159
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:31,126
So every four to six months Kendra's like,

160
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:32,434
we need to clean the garage

161
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:33,499
and I feel that too,

162
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,936
so I did a little cleaning

163
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:36,816
and we have bulk trash coming up,

164
00:05:36,816 --> 00:05:39,587
so I'm wondering if we
should get rid of this toy.

165
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:40,610
- (mumbles)

166
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,080
- Oh, my turn. My turn.

167
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,660
- It's an old gross toy that
we got from a garage sale.

168
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,628
The kids really love it
every once in a while

169
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,538
but it's big and bulky

170
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,340
and so I think we might get rid of it.

171
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,923
(upbeat music)

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,607
Maybe we shouldn't get rid of that toy,

173
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:04,440
the kids love it.

174
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,015
So this is our donate pile.

175
00:06:06,015 --> 00:06:07,333
It will feel really good when we get rid

176
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,568
of all this stuff.

177
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,230
Alright, so this is the
shoe you were talkin' about?

178
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,063
- [Kendra] Yep.

179
00:06:11,063 --> 00:06:13,507
- [Jeremy] I see a green like a mint green

180
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:14,862
and a gray shoe.

181
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:15,695
That's what I see.

182
00:06:15,695 --> 00:06:16,528
- [Kendra] Me too.

183
00:06:16,528 --> 00:06:18,605
- [Jeremy] What else is there to see?

184
00:06:18,605 --> 00:06:20,845
- What do you girls see?

185
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:22,397
- Why do we have to see?

186
00:06:22,397 --> 00:06:23,867
- What color do you think that shoe is?

187
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,525
- [Laura] Mint color!

188
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,122
- Gray and mint.

189
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:29,972
- Okay, our family only
sees gray and mint.

190
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,962
That's what I see too, is a teal gray,

191
00:06:31,962 --> 00:06:33,120
but apparently some people see a pink

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,980
and white shoe when they
look at that picture.

193
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,813
- Alright.
- Ahh, I see

194
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:36,646
some pink!

195
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,295
- I mean, I can see that
there might be a haze of pink.

196
00:06:39,295 --> 00:06:40,750
Like I do see that, I see.

197
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,082
- No like they see it's
like a pink shoe with white.

198
00:06:45,082 --> 00:06:45,915
- What?

199
00:06:45,915 --> 00:06:46,748
- What?

200
00:06:46,748 --> 00:06:47,581
- That's insane, okay

201
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,800
and the poll when you look at the shoe,

202
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
do you see the green and gray

203
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,368
or do you see pink and white?

204
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:55,753
I wouldn't call green, I
mean it's like teal or mint.

205
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:56,807
- It's like a mint.

206
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:57,640
- Yeah.
- Let us know in the poll.

207
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,473
- I wish we could ask Janae what she saw.

208
00:06:58,473 --> 00:06:59,876
- [Jeremy] What do you see?

209
00:06:59,876 --> 00:07:01,781
- [Laura] I see (mumbles)!

210
00:07:01,781 --> 00:07:03,007
(squeels)

211
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:03,840
(gives raspberry)

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,090
(laughing)

213
00:07:07,298 --> 00:07:08,913
- What color is that shoe?

214
00:07:08,913 --> 00:07:10,283
- Turquiosed?

215
00:07:10,283 --> 00:07:11,496
- What do you see Caleb?

216
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,079
- I see, light blue

217
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,858
and light gray and.

218
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,553
- [Jeremy] No one sees pink.

219
00:07:18,553 --> 00:07:20,446
- No, so apparently some
people when they see

220
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:21,694
the shoe picture, they see a pink

221
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:22,944
and white shoe.

222
00:07:24,016 --> 00:07:25,714
- [Jeremy] Isn't that crazy?

223
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:27,579
So we are only seeing it like this

224
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:30,549
but apparently some
people the pink and white.

225
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:31,973
- You'll hear it from a long ways away

226
00:07:31,973 --> 00:07:33,186
as those storms approach.

227
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,816
This is all part of a huge line

228
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:36,609
of thunderstorms that
will eventually catch up

229
00:07:36,609 --> 00:07:38,162
with the Kansas City metro.

230
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,716
Looks like the metro area will

231
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:42,186
be impacted just after sunset.

232
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:44,769
(upbeat music)

233
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:50,731
- [Kendra] Barbequed
chicken, potatoes, salad.

234
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:51,977
- [Jeremy] Looks good.

235
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,364
- What's for dinner?

236
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:56,127
So I'm making some really
quick pumpkin cookies

237
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,776
and I just wasn't sure if
we had any pumpkin spice.

238
00:07:58,776 --> 00:07:59,792
- We have a little lifetime
- Just kidding, we have.

239
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:00,625
- Supply.

240
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:03,509
- Yeah, more than a lifetime supply.

241
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:06,807
- (laughing) I have a (mumbles).

242
00:08:06,807 --> 00:08:09,057
- The drivers are very bad.

243
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:13,127
- So we're ending the night with popcorn

244
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:14,379
and a movie.

245
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,879
(piano music)

246
00:08:21,576 --> 00:08:22,409
- [Laura] Thank you.

247
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,714
- [Kendra] You're welcome.

248
00:08:23,714 --> 00:08:24,547
- [Caleb] Night Mom.

249
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,542
- [Laura] Good night JSL.

250
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:27,617
I'm going on a date with daddy.

251
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,400
- [Kendra] Okay, you guys
headed out on a bike ride?

252
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
- [All] Yep!

253
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:32,957
(sneeze)

254
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:33,789
- [Kendra] Oh, bless you.

255
00:08:33,789 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Caleb] Finally.
