1
00:00:00,189 --> 00:00:01,549
- Thank you.

2
00:00:01,549 --> 00:00:04,549
(lively rock music)

3
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:06,705
(ripping paper)

4
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:07,880
Yeah!

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,047
No one's here.

6
00:00:13,336 --> 00:00:14,875
(bright jazzy music)

7
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:17,542
- [Jeremy] Happy birthday buddy.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,245
Birthday boy wanted to crack
his own eggs for breakfast.

9
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:32,878
- This is fun doing this.

10
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,430
- [Jeremy] I'm glad that this

11
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,420
on your birthday was

12
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:38,198
- Yeah, I learned a funny trick

13
00:00:38,198 --> 00:00:40,240
from you for scrambled eggs.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,770
- [Jeremy] Scrambling them up.

15
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:43,920
- [Caleb] Cooking well.

16
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,741
- [Kendra] Are you making

17
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:47,574
- Mmm-hmm.

18
00:00:47,574 --> 00:00:49,540
Looks pretty good to me.

19
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,980
- [Kendra] Yeah, I think it might be done.

20
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,670
- She took a picture of me.

21
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:53,952
Can I keep it?

22
00:00:53,952 --> 00:00:54,785
- Yep.

23
00:00:55,849 --> 00:00:59,182
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

24
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,198
- [Laura] Cha cha cha,
with a cherry on the top.

25
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:03,031
- Make a wish.

26
00:01:05,867 --> 00:01:06,700
Yay!
(clapping)

27
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:07,700
- [All] Yay!

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,620
(gentle jazzy music)

29
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,220
- [Jeremy] How's your banana milk?

30
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,809
- It's good.

31
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,070
- It's really good.

32
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,410
- So Caleb chose cinnamon
rolls and orange rolls

33
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,243
for breakfast today.

34
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,200
It looks good.

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,270
Caleb's gonna eat from a birthday plate.

36
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,190
- So while we eat breakfast,

37
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,590
we say the things we love about Caleb

38
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,465
and we'd love to hear in the comments

39
00:01:24,465 --> 00:01:26,070
what you love about Caleb.

40
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,070
- I love how much love Caleb has.

41
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:32,360
He loves with such passion and intensity,

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,560
he's a great snuggler and he's so kind

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,860
and he just really loves everyone

44
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,860
in our family.

45
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,660
- I love that he always
wants to play with us,

46
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:43,040
like hear about what we did.

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,040
- I love how fiercely
independent Caleb is.

48
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,390
Sometimes as a parent that means

49
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,520
he's getting into stuff or doing things,

50
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,690
but I know that as he
continues to grow up,

51
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,210
that independence is gonna lead to him

52
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,573
creating and doing some

53
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,430
amazing incredible stuff.
(Janae shouting)

54
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,240
- I love how Caleb brings so much joy.

55
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,220
Like if we're playing outside

56
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,220
and then he just figures out
something fun to do with us.

57
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,770
- [Jeremy] What do you love about Cubby?

58
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:12,520
(Janae babbling)

59
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,963
Yeah I love that too.

60
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,230
- What I love about Caleb?

61
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:22,230
He puts me to sleep when I was two.

62
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,483
- [Caleb] And three.

63
00:02:23,483 --> 00:02:24,316
- Yeah.

64
00:02:24,316 --> 00:02:25,149
(gasps)

65
00:02:25,149 --> 00:02:25,982
- [Kendra] Are you gonna help him?

66
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:27,040
- Are you gonna help me?

67
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,518
- Here, I'm gonna let her stand right here

68
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:32,304
and this is the present that she gave you.

69
00:02:32,304 --> 00:02:33,968
- More Legos?

70
00:02:33,968 --> 00:02:35,698
And candy?

71
00:02:35,698 --> 00:02:37,232
Thank you.

72
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:39,032
Look Isaac, look.

73
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:40,500
- That's gonna be fun to build.

74
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,410
- I know.

75
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,165
- I wrapped this present all by myself.

76
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,354
- Let's see what it is.

77
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:46,666
(uptempo music)

78
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:47,499
- Legos.

79
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:49,182
- What is this?

80
00:02:49,182 --> 00:02:50,130
- They light up.

81
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,770
You put 'em on your fingers.

82
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,377
And gum.

83
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:54,981
You could share the gum with me.

84
00:02:54,981 --> 00:02:56,415
- Thank you.

85
00:02:56,415 --> 00:02:59,541
(uptempo music)

86
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:00,430
- It's called Plus-Plus.

87
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,930
- You can build stuff by
putting stuff together

88
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,710
with the different colors.

89
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,230
- That's really cool.

90
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,310
That is awesome.

91
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,230
Thank you.

92
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,020
- You can have your own pair of glasses.

93
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,509
- Yeah, now I can.

94
00:03:12,509 --> 00:03:15,092
(bright music)

95
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,750
My own coding make and jam music.

96
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,360
- [Kendra] This is a coding
one where you code music,

97
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,920
so you code different drum beats

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,770
and you make the music.

99
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,720
- That's so cool and then what's this?

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,600
- [Kendra] That's another came called Duo,

101
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,170
it's another coding game.

102
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,003
- Cool.

103
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,743
Thank you.

104
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,259
My own NFL football?

105
00:03:39,991 --> 00:03:41,910
It's the perfect size.

106
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:48,444
- Not too hard, like if
it hits you in the face,

107
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:50,580
it doesn't hurt, but--

108
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,641
- It's the perfect size,

109
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,474
- [Jeremy] Good catch.

110
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:55,610
- Like I can catch it with one hand.

111
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,774
- There it is.

112
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,816
(ripping paper)

113
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:01,461
- Yeah, Hot Wheels!

114
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:05,495
Whoa, that's awesome.

115
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,850
Cool.

116
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,138
Thank you.

117
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:08,971
Thank you.

118
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:09,804
(Jeremy laughs)

119
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:11,721
- You're welcome buddy.

120
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:14,863
Thanks for sharing buddy, that's nice.

121
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:17,173
- [Isaac] Thank you.

122
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,756
(bright music)

123
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,957
- The birthday boy is
trying out Osmo Coding Jam.

124
00:04:29,957 --> 00:04:33,040
(echoing notes)

125
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,960
Did you make that?

126
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:38,303
(echoing notes)

127
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,639
I like my toy.

128
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,000
- [Kendra] You like it?

129
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,070
- [Jeremy] Hey can I help
you put this thing up?

130
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,665
- Yeah, let's do it.

131
00:04:43,665 --> 00:04:47,400
(uptempo rock music)

132
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,690
These things make it go really fast.

133
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,712
(Hot Wheels racing)

134
00:04:58,712 --> 00:05:00,748
I'm still going!

135
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,396
I turned it perfectly.

136
00:05:02,396 --> 00:05:04,396
- The battle begins now.

137
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:09,120
He's going.

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,120
(Hot Wheels racing)

139
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:14,979
- Yeah, got it!

140
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:20,360
- [Jeremy] I shut you
down, oh you hit me out!

141
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,995
- [Kendra] Did you win that round?

142
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:23,745
- Yeah I think I did.

143
00:05:25,642 --> 00:05:28,200
- Nae Nae's like what is this?

144
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,560
So for lunch, Caleb requested

145
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,460
club sandwiches on croissants.

146
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,293
Yum.

147
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:35,590
So there's a club sandwich
with all the fixin's,

148
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,900
it's even got bacon and avocado.

149
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,350
- Woo hoo!

150
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:40,680
- [Kendra] Happy birthday.

151
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,067
And apparently Nae Nae
learned a new trick.

152
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,439
(Janae squealing)

153
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:46,020
Putting a necklace on.

154
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,688
She's like where'd it go?

155
00:05:47,688 --> 00:05:49,204
Where'd it go, what's going on?

156
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:53,384
- [Jeremy] Caleb, I love
your choice for lunch.

157
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,217
- Thank you.

158
00:05:54,217 --> 00:05:56,480
- [Jeremy] Look you have
a root beer mustache.

159
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:00,939
(electronic music)

160
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,690
Okay Cub, what did you want to do?

161
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:08,391
- I wanted to go to a
movie at the theaters.

162
00:06:08,391 --> 00:06:09,472
No one's here.

163
00:06:09,472 --> 00:06:10,305
- We have the whole theater to ourselves.

164
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,710
(lively music)

165
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,310
It is always really fun when you have

166
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,950
the theater all to yourself,

167
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,720
so we got here just as
the previews are starting

168
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,850
and we're deciding where
to sit in an empty theater.

169
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,340
Poll question, what do you
prefer, the front, middle, back?

170
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,153
You can sit wherever you want.

171
00:06:29,153 --> 00:06:29,986
Should we do the middle?

172
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:34,157
- No, I want to go by myself with Isaac.

173
00:06:34,157 --> 00:06:37,298
(epic rousing music)

174
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,110
(stopwatch ticking)

175
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,141
- [Jeremy] Did you like the movie bud?

176
00:06:40,141 --> 00:06:41,352
- Yeah.

177
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:43,165
- We're the only people in here.

178
00:06:43,165 --> 00:06:44,975
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

179
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:47,950
(bright music)

180
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,210
Where are we going now Cub?

181
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,840
- To get my birthday cake.

182
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,160
Ice cream cake.

183
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,213
That looks good.

184
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,860
- [Jeremy] So the initial one,

185
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,910
they spelled his name Balb.

186
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:01,824
Happy birthday Balb.

187
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:03,400
(laughing)

188
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,300
But they're gonna make us another one.

189
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,876
You got skills.

190
00:07:12,876 --> 00:07:13,709
- Thank you.

191
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,714
Is that better Caleb?

192
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:15,547
- Yeah.

193
00:07:15,547 --> 00:07:16,680
- [Jeremy] Is that your name?

194
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,014
- Yep, that one's yours?
- Cool, we'll take it.

195
00:07:18,014 --> 00:07:20,290
- So Caleb chose all of our meals today

196
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,950
and for dinner, he chose spaghetti

197
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,070
with corn and cheesy toast.

198
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,080
So it's been really fun
to celebrate Caleb today

199
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,210
and to think back on his fifth year.

200
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,430
It was a big year for him.

201
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,500
He learned how to ride a bike,

202
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,440
he learned how to read,

203
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,610
he learned how to tie his shoes,

204
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,780
he started kindergarten.

205
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,750
Oh, and rollerskating.

206
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,940
He learned to rollerskate.

207
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,280
Anyway, I'm just really proud of all

208
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,230
that he's learned this year

209
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,150
and especially the ways
that I've seen him progress

210
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,300
in his patience and his hard work

211
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,800
and his good attitude.
- And going to bed at night.

212
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
- And doing chores, and
going to bed at night.

213
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm excited to see what year six brings

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,850
for this boy.

215
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,550
Gymnastics time.
(upbeat music)

216
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,800
Say gymnastics.

217
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:53,677
- [Laura] Gymnastics.

218
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:54,940
- Me and Nae Nae are gonna stay home,

219
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,442
everybody else is going to gymnastics.

220
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,275
- [Kendra] Bye.

221
00:07:57,275 --> 00:07:58,254

238
00:08:38,350 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness,
look at this temperature.
