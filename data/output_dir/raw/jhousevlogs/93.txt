1
00:00:00,183 --> 00:00:01,332
- Alright the big question.

2
00:00:01,332 --> 00:00:03,915
Will we be having another baby?

3
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:06,804
- Today we're gonna do a Q&A.

4
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:09,289
- [Dad] What do you guys
want to do when you're older?

5
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:12,304
- I think I'm gonna finish
J House Vlogs for you.

6
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:15,229
And then once I'm finished J House Vlogs,

7
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:17,106
I'm gonna pass it over to Elise and

8
00:00:17,106 --> 00:00:18,998
then she can keep on going.

9
00:00:18,998 --> 00:00:21,976
- A singer, a dancer, an actor.

10
00:00:21,976 --> 00:00:23,248
- Pass it to Laura.

11
00:00:23,248 --> 00:00:26,081
- A dress upper and makeup person.

12
00:00:26,974 --> 00:00:30,416
- And then while that's
happening I'll be getting fat.

13
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,741
(laughing)

14
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,350
(baby talk)

15
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:37,488
- I wanna play the NFL
and I know it has a small

16
00:00:37,488 --> 00:00:39,616
chance of happening and if it doesn't,

17
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:43,970
I could be a lawyer, or
maybe even a Youtuber,

18
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:46,310
And just like do J House
Vlogs and then it could

19
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,095
go down the generations.

20
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,450
- [Dad] What is your dream job?

21
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,250
- I think being a singer, singer.

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,965
- [Dad] What would you like
to do dance or gymnastics?

23
00:00:55,965 --> 00:00:58,632
- I like dancing and gymnastics.

24
00:01:00,169 --> 00:01:03,822
- [Dad] Would you like to be
a builder or an architect?

25
00:01:03,822 --> 00:01:05,409
- I want to builder.

26
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:06,579
- [Dad] You wanna be a builder?

27
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,019
What don't you talk about
being a little grandma?

28
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,787
- When I be grandma,

29
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,441
it's just the longest time ago.

30
00:01:13,441 --> 00:01:16,211
- [Dad] Back when you
were a little grandma.

31
00:01:16,211 --> 00:01:17,044
- Yeah.

32
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,095
- [Dad] Can you tell us
the story about back when

33
00:01:18,095 --> 00:01:19,470
you were a little grandma?

34
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,530
- You know one time when
I was cooking macaroni

35
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:24,697
and cheese I burnt myself.

36
00:01:26,963 --> 00:01:29,113
- [Dad] Back when you
were a little grandma?

37
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:29,946
- Yeah.

38
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:31,180
- [Dad] How has Janae impacted your lives

39
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,846
since she was born?

40
00:01:32,846 --> 00:01:35,795
- Well, she's cute, I
think she broke the record

41
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:38,202
of most cutest person ever.

42
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:40,799
- I think life is more
happier with a baby.

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,141
- She just makes us happy
and she makes fun sounds

44
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:45,852
and I like watching her learn.

45
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,461
- [Dad] What's it like being a big sister?

46
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,609
- I like it but I used to be two.

47
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,083
- [Dad] And now what are you?

48
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,063
Three, awesome.

49
00:01:54,063 --> 00:01:57,735
She brings us so much happiness
she's so fun and adorable

50
00:01:57,735 --> 00:01:59,652
and reactive and smart.

51
00:02:00,861 --> 00:02:03,751
If you could repaint your room,
what color would you choose?

52
00:02:03,751 --> 00:02:05,046
- Red for chiefs.

53
00:02:05,046 --> 00:02:06,126
- Rainbow.

54
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,377
- Light blue because
it's my favorite color.

55
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,745
Or with like little swirls on it

56
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:13,370
or hearts or flowers or something.

57
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,900
(baby talk)

58
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,095
- [Dad] If you could
repaint your room any color

59
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,769
what color would you choose?

60
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:19,602
- Pink.

61
00:02:19,602 --> 00:02:20,876
- [Dad] That was tough.

62
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,337
- What is my favorite chore.

63
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,022
I actually think I kinda like chores,

64
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,386
that's probably weird.

65
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:27,918
I hate wiping off the
counters and sweeping.

66
00:02:27,918 --> 00:02:29,078
I really hate that one.

67
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:30,019
But you didn't ask what I hated,

68
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:30,852
you asked what I loved.

69
00:02:30,852 --> 00:02:32,428
I like doing the dishes, mostly because

70
00:02:32,428 --> 00:02:34,499
I like how I feel when
the kitchen's clean.

71
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:38,123
I also really like
vacuuming and making my bed.

72
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:39,427
Definitely that's my favorite.

73
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:42,384
- I would say, folding laundry.

74
00:02:42,384 --> 00:02:44,624
- We basically don't like chores,

75
00:02:44,624 --> 00:02:47,519
I think my favorite one is cleaning

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,855
the bathroom cause for some reason

77
00:02:49,855 --> 00:02:52,769
I like cleaning the toilet and the sink.

78
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:53,819
It's weird.

79
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,357
- I don't like chores.

80
00:02:55,357 --> 00:02:57,111
- [Dad] Are there any of them you like?

81
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,014
- I like putting on clothes.

82
00:02:59,014 --> 00:03:00,913
Clothes chores.

83
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:01,961
- [Dad] That's a good chore.

84
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,472
- I don't like any of them
I would choose an easy one

85
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:07,182
so that would be starting a
load of laundry or practice

86
00:03:07,182 --> 00:03:09,543
basketball for 20 minutes.

87
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:11,681
- [Dad] Is that a chore,
practice basketball?

88
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,514
- Yeah.

89
00:03:12,514 --> 00:03:13,966
- I've actually really
started liking washing

90
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:15,844
the dishes, but only if I'm blaring some

91
00:03:15,844 --> 00:03:18,651
of my favorite music at the same time.

92
00:03:18,651 --> 00:03:19,605
That's fun.

93
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:23,737
Janae, Janae, who do you
like better Mom or Dad?

94
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,665
(baby talk)

95
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,324
- [Dad] If we could have a pet
what would you want as a pet?

96
00:03:28,324 --> 00:03:30,135
- What's the fastest animal?

97
00:03:30,135 --> 00:03:31,610
- [Dad] American Falcon.

98
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,006
- Yeah I would have him.

99
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:36,292
So I can and it's big so I be on it's back

100
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:37,709
and it would fly.

101
00:03:39,154 --> 00:03:41,270
Or I would have a cheetah.

102
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,769
- [Dad] Why do you want a cheetah?

103
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,278
- So then it can teach me how to run fast.

104
00:03:45,278 --> 00:03:46,195
- A puppy.

105
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:49,173
You can teach him tricks
and you can train 'em.

106
00:03:49,173 --> 00:03:52,256
But I would also like a
bigger dog that's trained.

107
00:03:52,256 --> 00:03:55,058
Our dog would basically protect us.

108
00:03:55,058 --> 00:03:56,633
(baby talk)

109
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,332
(laughing)

110
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,209
- I wanna a dog.

111
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:00,481
- [Dad] What kind of dog?

112
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:02,054
- German Shepherd.

113
00:04:02,054 --> 00:04:03,802
- [Dad] What do you wanna name the dog?

114
00:04:03,802 --> 00:04:04,857
- Sherman.

115
00:04:04,857 --> 00:04:06,713
(laughing)

116
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,142
- I grew up having cats and dogs.

117
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:10,785
And I like both of them a lot.

118
00:04:10,785 --> 00:04:11,776
- A dog.

119
00:04:11,776 --> 00:04:13,745
That is named Sally.

120
00:04:13,745 --> 00:04:15,476
- What is my favorite color?

121
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,309
Green.

122
00:04:16,309 --> 00:04:17,142
- Pink.

123
00:04:17,142 --> 00:04:17,975
- Red and blue.

124
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:18,808
- Blue.

125
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:19,641
- Light blue.

126
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,786
(baby talk)

127
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:21,854
- I like teal.

128
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:23,440
- [Dad] What's your favorite holiday?

129
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,363
- Christmas.

130
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:26,052
- I like Halloween.

131
00:04:26,052 --> 00:04:28,426
But Christmas is good too.

132
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:31,172
- To be honest I really like
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

133
00:04:31,172 --> 00:04:32,049
- Christmas.

134
00:04:32,049 --> 00:04:33,074
- Christmas.

135
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:34,951
- My favorite holiday is Thanksgiving.

136
00:04:34,951 --> 00:04:37,169
I really love the pretty
Fall weather, I love

137
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,036
the good food, the
family time, it's kind of

138
00:04:39,036 --> 00:04:41,151
a low key holiday with
not a lot of expectations

139
00:04:41,151 --> 00:04:43,414
which means it's lower stress for me.

140
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:46,114
I also though really love
the Christmas season.

141
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:48,622
I feel like the magic is
in all the weeks ahead

142
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,578
of time when you're baking the cookies,

143
00:04:50,578 --> 00:04:52,471
and reading the stories, and snuggling

144
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:54,337
up to Christmas music, so I love Christmas

145
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,946
season but Thanksgiving
is probably my favorite

146
00:04:56,946 --> 00:04:58,454
actual holiday.

147
00:04:58,454 --> 00:05:00,052
- [Dad] Madeline asked
how long do you think

148
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:01,614
you'll continue to vlog?

149
00:05:01,614 --> 00:05:03,620
- Until we feel done.

150
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,497
- [Dad] When do you think we'll feel done.

151
00:05:05,497 --> 00:05:08,510
- Maybe in like 20 years, I don't know.

152
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,606
- I think maybe two years.

153
00:05:10,606 --> 00:05:13,744
- I think when I'm like married.

154
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:15,940
I want if I'm like a grandma,

155
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,336
I want to remember what job I had.

156
00:05:19,336 --> 00:05:20,404
- You know there's time when I think about

157
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:22,656
how fun it would be if
the Vlog could continue on

158
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,266
for generations like
after we're done vlogging

159
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:29,540
with our family it goes
on and we did like a day

160
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,264
each day with one of
the kids, and so through

161
00:05:32,264 --> 00:05:34,322
a week you saw what was
going on in their lives

162
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:36,705
and our grandkids were
able to be a part of it.

163
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:40,298
But who knows, I mean, I think
it's to the point where it's

164
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,774
something that we aren't enjoying anymore,

165
00:05:41,774 --> 00:05:43,000
or it's something that we
feel like we should stop

166
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,475
because that's what's best for our family,

167
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:47,278
we could stop tomorrow, so it's really an

168
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:48,805
unpredictable thing.

169
00:05:48,805 --> 00:05:50,532
- [Dad] What do you like about Isaac?

170
00:05:50,532 --> 00:05:52,317
- He's really encouraging and I really

171
00:05:52,317 --> 00:05:54,783
like having a big brother.

172
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:56,804
- [Dad] What's your
favorite thing about Caleb?

173
00:05:56,804 --> 00:05:59,665
- I like how he likes
playing pretend a lot.

174
00:05:59,665 --> 00:06:00,936
- [Dad] How about little Laura?

175
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:03,141
- I really like playing with Laura.

176
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,762
- [Dad] What do you like most about Janae?

177
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:05,895
- She's cute.

178
00:06:05,895 --> 00:06:07,538
- [Dad] What do you like most about Laura?

179
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:09,288
- She's fun, playful.

180
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:11,740
- [Dad] What do you like most about Elise?

181
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,657
- She is understanding.

182
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:17,307
- [Dad] Understanding.

183
00:06:17,307 --> 00:06:18,532
What do you like most about Isaac?

184
00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:21,400
- He's playful and teaches me.

185
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,227
- [Dad] What do you like most about Isaac?

186
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:24,134
- He's pretty nice.

187
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,378
Caleb is actually a little bit mean to me.

188
00:06:27,378 --> 00:06:28,947
- [Dad] What do you like most about Elise?

189
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:31,367
- Elise is a little bit nice.

190
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:33,382
- [Dad] What do you like most about Janae?

191
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:35,239
- Like Janae is a lot more nice.

192
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,679
- [Dad] She's the nicest.

193
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,651
It helps when they can't talk.

194
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,864
What do you like the most about Elise?

195
00:06:40,864 --> 00:06:42,902
- She's fun to play with and she is older

196
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,152
so she understands me more.

197
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:48,280
- [Dad] What do you like most about Caleb?

198
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,844
- He's my only brother.

199
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:52,815
And we can play sports together.

200
00:06:52,815 --> 00:06:54,243
- [Dad] What do you like most about Laura?

201
00:06:54,243 --> 00:06:55,388
- She's cute.

202
00:06:55,388 --> 00:06:56,796
- [Dad] What do you like most about Janae?

203
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:57,801
- She's cute.

204
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,877
(laughing)

205
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,240
(baby talk)

206
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,536
- Andrew McVie asked an
important question he said,

207
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:07,305
do you guys do stuff so you
can film it for the vlogs?

208
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:08,699
- The short answer is no.

209
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,007
We try really hard to
think about what is best

210
00:07:12,007 --> 00:07:13,784
for our family, what is
it that we're wanting to

211
00:07:13,784 --> 00:07:15,450
teach our children this
week, what experiences

212
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,540
do we want to have with
them, to try to raise

213
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,578
them to be good human beings.

214
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:22,346
- And the vlog is a secondary
consideration instead

215
00:07:22,346 --> 00:07:24,640
of the primary motive
for what we're doing.

216
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,746
- And so that's how we
choose what we're gonna film.

217
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,514
We obviously film challenges
and things like this Q&A.

218
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,347
Just for the vlog.

219
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:31,325
Cause they're fun.

220
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,822
- LeeAnn Marie asked do you
ever feel silly or awkward

221
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,480
while vlogging yourself in public?

222
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,673
I am an extrovert so this
isn't super hard for me.

223
00:07:39,673 --> 00:07:41,910
When you know that there's a lot of people

224
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,541
watching you in the camera.

225
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:46,107
I get that there's maybe 30 or 40 people

226
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:47,829
here at the restaurant but I'm talking to

227
00:07:47,829 --> 00:07:50,395
a lot more people here on the camera.

228
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:52,968
- Yes, yes, I feel silly
and awkward vlogging

229
00:07:52,968 --> 00:07:54,556
in public all the time.

230
00:07:54,556 --> 00:07:55,871
I feel silly and awkward vlogging in my

231
00:07:55,871 --> 00:07:58,145
own house it's worse when I'm around like

232
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,091
my family or friends like people who know

233
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:02,140
what I'm doing then I feeling the most

234
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,984
awkwardest which I don't know why that is.

235
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,459
Sometimes people look at you pretty funny

236
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,192
when you're done, some people know what

237
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:09,878
YouTube is and they're like is that for

238
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:11,961
YouTube like they get all excited.

239
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:14,133
And but I think the most common reaction

240
00:08:14,133 --> 00:08:16,159
is did you want me to take your picture,

241
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:17,877
like they think we're
trying to take a selfie.

242
00:08:17,877 --> 00:08:20,500
But we're not, I'm like,
so that's kind of awkward.

243
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,595
Cause I'm like oh thanks,
but no I'm just gonna

244
00:08:22,595 --> 00:08:25,766
keep talking to my camera
cause that's what I do.

245
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:27,856
I feel awkward even
right now, I don't know

246
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:29,667
what it is about me and
camera's I'm just not super

247
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,349
comfortable with them I guess.

248
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:33,450
Which is funny because we've been flogging

249
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,285
for three years now so I can say this,

250
00:08:35,285 --> 00:08:38,377
it has gotten a lot a
lot easier, and it's much

251
00:08:38,378 --> 00:08:40,515
easier to film the kids in public doing

252
00:08:40,515 --> 00:08:41,703
something than to film myself.

253
00:08:41,703 --> 00:08:43,164
Cause that's kind of
normal, everybody films

254
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:44,750
their kids, so I think
people are just like

255
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,890
ah wow that mom's really excited about all

256
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,296
the stuff her kids do.

257
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,725
It's when I turn it around and talk to it

258
00:08:49,725 --> 00:08:51,975
myself that that's awkward.

259
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:54,823
- [Dad] This question
is from Jane Hubbard,

260
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:57,154
will you be having another baby?

261
00:08:57,154 --> 00:08:58,834
- I don't know.

262
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,825
- Honestly after our last two babies I was

263
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:04,158
feeling done but then over time and with

264
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,644
prayer I opened my heart and we made the

265
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:10,310
decision to have another
baby and I've been

266
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,795
really happy with that and so

267
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,763
when we had Janae I
thought I was done, but

268
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,914
who knows what's gonna happen.

269
00:09:16,914 --> 00:09:19,987
- Alright the big
question, will we be having

270
00:09:19,987 --> 00:09:20,840
another baby?

271
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,638
I wish that I knew the
answer, I really do.

272
00:09:23,638 --> 00:09:25,531
I wish that I knew
whether our family ends up

273
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,917
having any more kids or
not but I don't honestly

274
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:29,640
know right now, Jeremy
and I felt really lead

275
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,555
to have Janae and we
were both really nervous

276
00:09:32,555 --> 00:09:33,986
about having a fifth
kid, five kids is a lot

277
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:35,955
to take care of and so
we were overwhelmed,

278
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:39,362
but it has worked out to
be nothing but a blessing.

279
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:43,008
That Janae is an absolute
joy and privilege

280
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:45,417
to have in our home, we
are so blessed to have her.

281
00:09:45,417 --> 00:09:48,795
We just love her so much
and so while we thought

282
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:51,000
she was going to be our
last there's definitely

283
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,608
been some moments where
Jeremy and I are looking

284
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:56,237
at each other going, should
we have another baby.

285
00:09:56,237 --> 00:09:59,639
So I think we're both
open to it but we're both

286
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,082
very aware and want to
be careful and do what's

287
00:10:02,082 --> 00:10:04,332
right for our whole family.

288
00:10:05,668 --> 00:10:07,327
So whatever decision
we make will be a very

289
00:10:07,327 --> 00:10:09,590
prayerful decision we
definitely felt inspired

290
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,658
and lead to have Janae
and I feel like that's

291
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:13,989
been a huge blessing in our lives, and

292
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,315
so we'll see.

293
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,510
It's sad to me to think about being done

294
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,872
having babies I really really love being

295
00:10:19,872 --> 00:10:22,394
a mom and I love having babies and so

296
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:25,613
to think that chapter
of my life is closing,

297
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:27,113
is very sad to me.

298
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:30,892
So if I had the privilege
of having another

299
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,265
child I would welcome that with open arms.

300
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,157
But I also feel a lot of peace with where

301
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:39,070
we're at with our five, so I don't know.

302
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,262
- J House Out.

303
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:42,012
- Good night J House.

304
00:10:45,539 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat jazz band music)
