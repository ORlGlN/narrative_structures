1
00:00:00,462 --> 00:00:03,962
(playful Christmas music)

2
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:11,158
- There he is, manly man.

3
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:12,957
Cutting down the Christmas
tree for his fam.

4
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:16,040
("O Christmas Tree")

5
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:28,097
Took us a while, but we
found a good Christmas tree.

6
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:29,427
What should we name it guys?

7
00:00:29,427 --> 00:00:30,356
- Leaf.

8
00:00:30,356 --> 00:00:31,189
- [Kendra] Leaf?

9
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:33,948
- Yeah, so our Christmas
tree's name is leaf.

10
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:35,401
That was Elise's idea.

11
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:37,484
We were taking a picture.

12
00:00:38,985 --> 00:00:40,673
(laughing)
(bright music)

13
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:42,184
And they're just like,

14
00:00:42,184 --> 00:00:43,949
they're slamming me.

15
00:00:43,949 --> 00:00:45,500
No!

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,468
No!

17
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:48,039
In the face.

18
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,875
(laughing)

19
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,644
(groaning)

20
00:00:52,644 --> 00:00:54,661
I think this is a good spot.

21
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:56,911
On three, let's roll it up.

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,514
Alright, here's our snowman.

23
00:01:01,514 --> 00:01:05,784
- [Caleb] But I'm gonna
get his snow belly button.

24
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:08,284
(happy music)

25
00:01:18,449 --> 00:01:19,316
- [Jeremy] Are you Joseph?

26
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:20,740
- Yeah.

27
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,657
Baby Jesus in the crib.

28
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,101
Done.

29
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:31,931
- [Jeremy] You're gonna
be such a gentle father.

30
00:01:31,931 --> 00:01:33,348
- It's Christmas!

31
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:38,878
♪ Jesus is born then Mary and Joseph ♪

32
00:01:40,318 --> 00:01:44,485
♪ Take care of them and
then Jesus goes to sleep ♪

33
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:49,512
- Aw.
- That was such

34
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:50,635
a pretty song bud.

35
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:51,845
- That's a sweet Christmas song.

36
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:54,679
(bright music)
- Whoa.

37
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,096
A new toothbrush?

38
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:59,653
Car!

39
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,903
- Whoa, makeup!

40
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:03,565
Real makeup?

41
00:02:03,565 --> 00:02:04,648
- Some Legos.

42
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:07,869
- A race car!

43
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,462
A purple race car.

44
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:12,379
Whoa!
- Wow!

45
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:17,945
Both of us.

46
00:02:17,945 --> 00:02:21,873
- [Caleb] Laura, Laura
got a new toothbrush.

47
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:22,706
- She loves to chew

48
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,808
on toothbrushes.
- Did you get a toothbrush?

49
00:02:24,808 --> 00:02:26,037
- [Jeremy] Oh, there she goes.

50
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:27,452
(laughing)

51
00:02:27,452 --> 00:02:30,297
♪ Oh monkey bread oh monkey bread ♪

52
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,824
♪ Oh monkey bread at 10 ♪

53
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:37,707
- [Jeremy] This is her first Christmas.

54
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:39,446
What's in there?

55
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,869
- (gasps) Yay!
- Yay.

56
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:45,118
She's like um, great, a dress.

57
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:46,920
Where's the paper again?
- What is it?

58
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,943
What is it Lise?

59
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:50,260
- Is it my turn now?
- It's a dress for you.

60
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,538
It's a merry Christmas dress.

61
00:02:52,538 --> 00:02:55,725
(Laura laughs)

62
00:02:55,725 --> 00:02:57,283
- Wow!

63
00:02:57,283 --> 00:02:58,116
Yeah, what.

64
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:01,922
- [Kendra] It's a firetruck
that shoots Play-Doh!

65
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:02,755
- What?

66
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:05,378
Shoots Play-Doh?

67
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,273
- Wowzers!

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,576
Wow!

69
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:13,158
Wow!

70
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,186
Let It Go Singers.

71
00:03:14,186 --> 00:03:17,446
I always wanted Let It Go Singers.

72
00:03:17,446 --> 00:03:18,598
Wow!

73
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,399
Oh and this?

74
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:23,230
Elsa and Anna underwear!

75
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,401
Who was it from?

76
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,651
- [Kendra] Mom and Dad!

77
00:03:25,651 --> 00:03:28,513
- I always wanted Elsa and Anna stuff.

78
00:03:28,513 --> 00:03:31,009
Thank you, thank you, thank
you, thank you so much.

79
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,223
- (gasps) I love it!

80
00:03:34,223 --> 00:03:35,594
- But these are like football cards,

81
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:37,039
but they're stickers.

82
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:38,912
And so you collect all the people

83
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:42,057
and you put 'em where
they belong on the teams.

84
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:44,640
- (gasps) Wow!

85
00:03:45,906 --> 00:03:46,906
I love this!

86
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:50,789
I thought it was just gonna
be some kind of chapter book

87
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,493
or something but it's not.

88
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:53,826
It's way better.

89
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,266
- Wow!
- Wow!

90
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:00,259
- Whoa!

91
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:02,638
- It is a plate set.

92
00:04:02,638 --> 00:04:03,804
It's plates!

93
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:05,530
Jeremy it's plates.

94
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,885
- We've currently had three adult plates,

95
00:04:07,885 --> 00:04:08,911
which has been a problem.

96
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:10,334
- For a long time.

97
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:12,084
Hey, this is awesome.

98
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:16,561
(Laura babbles)

99
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:19,677
(Jeremy laughs)

100
00:04:19,677 --> 00:04:20,596
Eh?

101
00:04:20,596 --> 00:04:23,039
- [Jeremy] Maybe help her on a corner.

102
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,429
Ooo.
- Good work!

103
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:25,269
- [Jeremy] What is it Isaac?

104
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,959
- Toilet paper.

105
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,792
- It's Kleenex.

106
00:04:27,792 --> 00:04:30,109
- [Jeremy] Kleenex.

107
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:34,551
It's a whole thing of Kleenex
just for her to pull out.

108
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:38,155
(scrambling chipmunk voices)

109
00:04:38,155 --> 00:04:42,322
- Alright, Caleb, your last
present is under that blanket.

110
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,993
(Caleb laughs)

111
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:48,493
(jazzy music)

112
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:52,753
- What is it?

113
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,586
- [Kendra] What is it?

114
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:05,601
- [Jeremy] I think he likes it.

115
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:07,255
I think he likes it.

116
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,088
- Whoa!

117
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,279
Whoa.

118
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,131
How does it come out of there?

119
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:15,964
- I don't know.

120
00:05:15,964 --> 00:05:17,098
We're pushing it.

121
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,688
- I really learned how to do makeup.

122
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:21,341
See?

123
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,702
- [Jeremy] So pretty.

124
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:25,119
- So I mix blue and dark pink

125
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,765
to do it into this color.

126
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,301
- [Jeremy] It's really working.

127
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:33,597
You look beautiful.

128
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:36,838
- Alright, in my family
we always did cheers.

129
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:37,671
We ready?

130
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,277
- I don't see this going well.

131
00:05:39,277 --> 00:05:40,376
- So how you do cheers

132
00:05:40,376 --> 00:05:42,615
is you touch your cups gently together.

133
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:43,448
Let me show you, watch.

134
00:05:43,448 --> 00:05:45,016
- Elise, do you wanna
touch yours against mine,

135
00:05:45,016 --> 00:05:45,996
really gently?

136
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,870
- To family and Christmas.

137
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,113
- [Jeremy] Cheers.

138
00:05:49,113 --> 00:05:49,946
- Cheers.

139
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:52,989
Cheers.

140
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:54,726
(kids giggling)

141
00:05:54,726 --> 00:05:57,365
you have to be so soft
when you do it Caleb.

142
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:58,330
Why?

143
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,519
- So that yours things doesn't spill.

144
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:01,385
- [Isaac] Dad, cheers.

145
00:06:01,385 --> 00:06:02,594
- Cheers.

146
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,750
This'll be a lot easier in 10 years.

147
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,831
Thanks man.

148
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:06,664
- Lise.

149
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:09,656
Mommy.

150
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:11,956
(Jeremy laughing)

151
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:12,932
- It's a ball.

152
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:14,747
- [Jeremy] No no, you don't
wanna tell her the present.

153
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:16,930
- But probably it's just--
- Shh.

154
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,987
- (gasps) Aw!

155
00:06:19,987 --> 00:06:20,987
It's a ball.

156
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,308
Say thank you.

157
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,374
- Okay I, it's your turn.

158
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,256
- Wow!

159
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,759
I love this.

160
00:06:34,557 --> 00:06:36,716
What does this do with it?

161
00:06:36,716 --> 00:06:37,713
They're already in there.

162
00:06:37,713 --> 00:06:39,446
- That's a motorcycle.

163
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:40,279
- I know!

164
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:43,170
- [Kendra] What do you say Isaac?

165
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,170
- Thank you.

166
00:06:48,684 --> 00:06:49,517
- Wow!

167
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:53,187
- [Jeremy] What is it?

168
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:54,278
- Cars.

169
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,778

170
00:06:55,778 --> 00:06:57,353
- [Kendra] (gasps) Awesome.

171
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:58,186
- Say thank you to Lise.

172
00:06:58,186 --> 00:06:59,030
- I bought a purple one

173
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,081
so both of us could
play with them together.

174
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:03,061
- And the orange one could be for me.

175
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:03,894
- Yeah.

176
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:04,752
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

177
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:05,865
Say thank you.
- And the green one

178
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:07,132
can be for me.

179
00:07:07,132 --> 00:07:07,965
- Yeah.

180
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,598
- That's why he got three.

181
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:10,598
- Thank you.

182
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,903
- Squeeze!

183
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:16,653
(Jeremy and Kendra laughing)

184
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:18,849
(Jeremy gasps)

185
00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:20,132
(playful music)

186
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:20,965
(Isaac laughing)

187
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:21,798
- Two cars.

188
00:07:21,798 --> 00:07:23,632
- You have so many cars!

189
00:07:23,632 --> 00:07:25,145
(kids laughing)

190
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,868
Look man, you have yellow and red,

191
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:28,535
your favorite color!

192
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,487
Say thank you to Isaac.

193
00:07:31,487 --> 00:07:33,059
- I, thank you.

194
00:07:33,059 --> 00:07:35,874
(Kendra laughing)

195
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,101
- Wait a second.

196
00:07:37,101 --> 00:07:39,235
(all laughing)

197
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:40,756
You got me the same thing.

198
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:41,589
I love it!

199
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,063
Go.
- What?

200
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:46,929
- Go, go, go, go, go.

201
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,675
Oh no, I missed it.

202
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:52,113
Awesome!

203
00:07:52,113 --> 00:07:53,469
- Jeremy's so happy.

204
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,636
He's always wanted a permanent
football playing buddy.

205
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:02,242
- It's been 20 minutes,
nonstop whistle blowing.

206
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:04,962
(whistles tooting)

207
00:08:04,962 --> 00:08:06,271
Merry Christmas!

208
00:08:06,271 --> 00:08:07,227
- [Caleb and Kendra] Merry Christmas.

209
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:09,134
- [Elise And Isaac] Merry Christmas.

210
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:12,634
(playful Christmas music)

211
00:08:16,267 --> 00:08:18,365
(Elise giggling)

212
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:20,501
- Growing up my family
lived in Cincinnati, Ohio

213
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,757
and downtown there was on
outdoor ice skating rink.

214
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:24,160
And we went every year as a family.

215
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,967
So this is like a really
magical family memory for me.

216
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,383
I'm glad to be able to take Elise today

217
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,796
and we're gonna have to bring
the other kids another time.

218
00:08:30,796 --> 00:08:33,405
Alright, we are slowly
getting the hang of it.

219
00:08:33,405 --> 00:08:34,238
- Whoa!

220
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:37,097
- [Kendra] You got it?

221
00:08:37,097 --> 00:08:38,219
- [Elise] Uh huh.

222
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:39,812
- Elise has fallen a few times

223
00:08:39,812 --> 00:08:44,061
but she's not hurt herself
yet, so that's good.

224
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:45,783
- Best day of my life.

225
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:46,616
- [Kendra] You think so?

226
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:47,986
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

227
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,446
- Now let's go skate!

228
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,279
- [Kendra] Some more?

229
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,112
- Yeah!

230
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:54,529
(bright Christmas music)

231
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:01,765
- [Elise And Isaac] Thank you!

232
00:09:01,765 --> 00:09:03,459
- Thank you.

233
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,460
- So my favorite part of this

234
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,332
is seeing everyone's faces.

235
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:08,042
Like people driving by
and just walking by,

236
00:09:08,042 --> 00:09:09,426
they just love seeing the kids out here

237
00:09:09,426 --> 00:09:10,795
ringing the bells.

238
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:13,094
♪ In a one horse open sleigh, hey ♪

239
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,445
♪ Jingle bells, jingle ♪

240
00:09:16,445 --> 00:09:17,278
- Whoa!

241
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,505
- [Jeremy] Is it getting full?

242
00:09:19,505 --> 00:09:20,664
- [Caleb] Yeah!

243
00:09:20,664 --> 00:09:22,101
- Merry Christmas.

244
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:23,323
- That's mine.

245
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:24,212
- Is that yours?

246
00:09:24,212 --> 00:09:25,045
Go see.

247
00:09:25,976 --> 00:09:27,465
- Oh, toothbrush.

248
00:09:27,465 --> 00:09:28,856
- [Kendra] Toothbrush.

249
00:09:28,856 --> 00:09:30,439
- It my toothbrush.

250
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,699
(Elise gasps)

251
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:34,532
- Yay!

252
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,721
Okay Isaac, you can come buddy.

253
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:41,186
Right over here dude, step right up.

254
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:42,936
- (gasps) I like 'em.

255
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:43,984
Hunter thing?

256
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,095
- Sham, washing things?

257
00:09:46,095 --> 00:09:47,515
- Yes!

258
00:09:47,515 --> 00:09:48,765
- Mickey Mouse.

259
00:09:49,946 --> 00:09:51,695
- [Kendra] Is it Minnie Mouse?

260
00:09:51,695 --> 00:09:52,528
- Yeah.

261
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:56,663
(Kendra laughs)

262
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,163
- My own lunchbox!

263
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,391
- [Kendra] Go.

264
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
- Gumball machine!

265
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,504
Yeah!

266
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:11,958
- [Kendra] Turn it over.

267
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,086
What is it?

268
00:10:13,086 --> 00:10:14,169
- Butt pants.

269
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,431
- [Jeremy] Butt pants?

270
00:10:16,431 --> 00:10:18,005
(kids laughing)

271
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,730
- Are those diapers?

272
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,888
What's this?

273
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,283
- My diaper.

274
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:23,616
Oh I, sparkling.

275
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,715
- Is that a bottle?

276
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,697
These are bottles of milk for your babies.

277
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:31,163
- It mine.

278
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,702
- Oh those are you yours?

279
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,095
- Yeah.
- That's for your baby.

280
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:35,858
- What do you say?

281
00:10:35,858 --> 00:10:37,858
- Um guys, I'm gonna go.

282
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:43,228
- [Jeremy] Hey guys, I'm
a mother, I gotta go.

283
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:45,831
(Kendra laughing)

284
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:46,748
She's gone.

285
00:10:48,288 --> 00:10:49,832
- Yeah!

286
00:10:49,832 --> 00:10:51,375
Thank you!

287
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:52,208
- Oh!

288
00:10:58,098 --> 00:11:01,265
- (gasps) High heels!

289
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:03,128
High heels.

290
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:09,886
- [Kendra] Do they fit?

291
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,989
- No, I buy my shirt.

292
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:14,046
- [Kendra] They fit?

293
00:11:14,046 --> 00:11:14,879
Whoo!

294
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:17,240
- Thank you!

295
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,202
- Oh you're welcome.

296
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:19,035
What do you?

297
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:20,974
- Hey guys, I think there's
another present over here.

298
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,317
- [Isaac] Candy canes.

299
00:11:22,317 --> 00:11:23,661
I saw it earlier.

300
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:24,937
- No it's not candy canes.

301
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:29,104
I think there's actually
one more present over here.

302
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,447
- [Kendra] That's curious.

303
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:32,626
- Sit down.

304
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:33,459
- [Kendra] That's weird.

305
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:34,292
I wonder how that got stuck.

306
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,657
- This is our last present.

307
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:37,574
You guys wanna open it?

308
00:11:39,161 --> 00:11:40,015
(kids gasping)

309
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:40,848
- An iPad!

310
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:43,509
Dude, it's an iPad.

311
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:45,467
- It's a tablet.

312
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,300
- Yes!

313
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:49,301
- Here it comes.

314
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:51,853
(screams)

315
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:53,486
(Kendra laughs)
Do it again!

316
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:54,319
Ready, go!

317
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:56,574
- [Kendra] Whoo!

318
00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:57,426
- Do it again.

319
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,259
Ready, go.

320
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:00,644
Ready?

321
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:02,779
(Kendra screams)

322
00:12:02,779 --> 00:12:05,529
- Go! (laughing)

323
00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:09,620
I think I'm gonna spend a lotta
time up here in the cabinets

324
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,689
grabbing these for the next day.

325
00:12:12,689 --> 00:12:15,761
(Laura screams)

326
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:16,761
- I crayons.

327
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,502
- [Jeremy] Are those your crayons?

328
00:12:19,502 --> 00:12:20,335
- Yes.

329
00:12:20,335 --> 00:12:21,559
- [Jeremy] How cool.

330
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:22,479
- Mickey Mouse.

331
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:24,302
- [Jeremy] Is it a Mickey Mouse crayon?

332
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,469
For your baby.

333
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,074
- [Kendra] I love Christmas afternoon.

334
00:12:32,074 --> 00:12:32,959
- Got it.

335
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,806
- No, I'm--

336
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:34,830
- You only needed one more.

337
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,663
- Yeah.

338
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,238
- [Kendra] Caleb's working
on his new Play-Doh

339
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:39,348
and Elise is painting her fingernails.

340
00:12:39,348 --> 00:12:42,071
- So we got them the Amazon Fire.

341
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,305
It was like 50 bucks.

342
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,846
- [Kendra] Dude, we
got it on Black Friday.

343
00:12:45,846 --> 00:12:47,155
It was like 35 bucks.

344
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,140
- It was like 35 bucks.

345
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,445
- [Kendra] We couldn't turn that down.

346
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:50,278
- That's right.

347
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,721
It was super cheap, we were like, hey.

348
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,742
- We'll just try this and
see what we think of it.

349
00:12:54,742 --> 00:12:56,575
This one is for Isaac.

350
00:12:58,436 --> 00:13:01,269
Alright and this one is for Daddy.

351
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,224
Go give it to Daddy.

352
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:06,493
- [Jeremy] Thank you.

353
00:13:06,493 --> 00:13:07,929
- [Caleb] I know what it is.

354
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,071
- And this one is for Mommy.

355
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:12,269
- She's like what is that?
(kids laughing)

356
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:13,290
Thank you.

357
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,457
Oh wait, give it to Mommy.

358
00:13:16,553 --> 00:13:18,034
She's like, well you gave it to me.

359
00:13:18,034 --> 00:13:19,793
- Do you wanna help me open it Laura?

360
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:23,336
- (gasps) Necklaces.

361
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,645
This is actually.
- I try.

362
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:26,943
- This actually a great pick.

363
00:13:26,943 --> 00:13:28,276
Thank you Laura!

364
00:13:29,565 --> 00:13:30,565
- Thank you.

365
00:13:31,926 --> 00:13:33,558
- [Jeremy] And look, look
what else you got her.

366
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:34,868
- Cubby bought you a skirt.

367
00:13:34,868 --> 00:13:36,399
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna put it on?

368
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:37,232
- Yeah.

369
00:13:37,232 --> 00:13:38,438
- [Jeremy] Let's put it on.

370
00:13:38,438 --> 00:13:40,461
Good pick Caleb.

371
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:42,084
- Yeah, I go with you.
- What do you say?

372
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:42,917
- [Jeremy] Yep.

373
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,584
- Oh she's twirling.

374
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,763
- [Jeremy] Are you a dancer?

375
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,011
A dangerous flashlight ballerina.

376
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:52,896
(all laughing)

377
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,396
- Thank you Caleb.

378
00:13:55,654 --> 00:13:56,830
- [Kendra] As she like braces herself.

379
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,472
- So slowly Laura is
gathering everybody's presents

380
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,397
while they're not paying attention

381
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:01,879
and putting 'em on herself.

382
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,546
(playful music)

383
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,916
(Jeremy laughs)

384
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,983
There you go, that's
how it's supposed to be.

385
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:13,566
A little bit lower.

386
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,303
There we go.

387
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:17,636
- Uh oh.
- Uh oh.

388
00:14:19,216 --> 00:14:21,543
- [Kendra] You look awesome.

389
00:14:21,543 --> 00:14:23,579
Show Daddy, smile.

390
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:24,996
- [Jeremy] Smile.

391
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:28,628
- I have no idea what this is.

392
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:32,147
- Don't be (mutters)
- I have no idea.

393
00:14:32,147 --> 00:14:34,230
(laughs)

394
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,730
It's a Twix bar.

395
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,731
That you wrapped so, you are so clever.

396
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,188
- So one of my family's
traditions growing up

397
00:14:43,188 --> 00:14:45,406
was to have a nice
dinner on Christmas night

398
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:47,685
and so this is our dinner tonight.

399
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:49,970
I kept it really simple
just because we're traveling

400
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,102
and so I just needed something easy today.

401
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:53,995
But we're having roast and potatoes.

402
00:14:53,995 --> 00:14:57,870
This is fruit: kiwi, pineapple,
strawberries, grapes.

403
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,727
Some veggies and some rolls.

404
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:03,553
Daddy for all the hard work
he does for our family.

405
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:07,035
To Isaac for being a wonderful brother.

406
00:15:07,035 --> 00:15:08,615
And so loving and kind.

407
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:12,245
To Elise for being a
wonderful friend and helper

408
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,165
and having a tender heart forever.

409
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:17,808
To Caleb for keeping us all busy.

410
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:20,704
And for Laura for being as cute as can be.

411
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:21,754
Merry Christmas.

412
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:22,587
- Cheers!

413
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,524
(playful Christmas music)

414
00:15:26,524 --> 00:15:28,032
- [Kendra] All right here are the before

415
00:15:28,032 --> 00:15:30,199
of the gingerbread houses.

416
00:15:31,217 --> 00:15:32,594
They're all still standing

417
00:15:32,594 --> 00:15:34,107
so I consider that a personal
victory at the moment.

418
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:35,711
You guys ready to start decorating?

419
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:36,787
- [Kids] Yeah.

420
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,287
(jazzy music)

421
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:45,615
- [Kendra] She puts one
on and one in her mouth.

422
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:55,468
- [Isaac] I really like this one.

423
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:56,858
- [Kendra] That is so sweet.

424
00:15:56,858 --> 00:16:01,175
Okay turn it around,
let's see all the sides.

425
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,842
(Elise squeals)

426
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,867
(Caleb and Jeremy laughing)

427
00:16:11,857 --> 00:16:12,940
- [Isaac] Go!

428
00:16:20,378 --> 00:16:21,211
- What?

429
00:16:22,254 --> 00:16:23,087
Wow.

430
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,663
(Caleb screams)

431
00:16:27,663 --> 00:16:29,122
- What are you excited about?

432
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,209
- This is.

433
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:31,188
- What is it?

434
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:32,515
- [Isaac] It's a table.

435
00:16:32,515 --> 00:16:34,283
- It is, it's a kid's table and chairs.

436
00:16:34,283 --> 00:16:36,945
But we, are gonna have to put it together.

437
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,088
We need a builder.

438
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:38,921
- Me!

439
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,082
- What?

440
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:43,999
It's a box?

441
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,377
(Kendra laughs)
- Yes!

442
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:49,606
- Oh, it's a box.

443
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,596
(all laughing)

444
00:16:51,596 --> 00:16:53,300
- You have to open it up.

445
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,873
- [Kendra] What is it?

446
00:16:54,873 --> 00:16:58,564
- Some of these toys are beautiful.

447
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,408
- [Kendra] Are they beautiful?

448
00:17:00,408 --> 00:17:02,575
They're pots and pans.

449
00:17:02,575 --> 00:17:05,505
- Oh could I, I could make food.

450
00:17:05,505 --> 00:17:09,172
- You could.
(Jeremy laughs)

451
00:17:13,647 --> 00:17:14,480
- What?

452
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:17,354
- [Kendra] It's a drill.

453
00:17:17,355 --> 00:17:19,584
- Thank you!
- Your own drill.

454
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:20,584
- Thank you!

455
00:17:21,728 --> 00:17:23,145
- You're welcome.

456
00:17:24,042 --> 00:17:26,027
- More Hot Wheels?

457
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:28,901
- [Jeremy] Okay you guys,
for the last family present,

458
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:30,425
you gotta go into the boys room

459
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:31,853
while we pull it out.

460
00:17:31,853 --> 00:17:33,853
Go ahead, go back there.

461
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:39,340
Okay, you can come.

462
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:42,471
- What?

463
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:45,995
- Yes!
- Yes!

464
00:17:45,995 --> 00:17:47,245
- This is mine!

465
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,851
- This like, a real mini kitchen.

466
00:17:51,767 --> 00:17:53,576
- Thank you!
- I love it.

467
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:55,743
- You're welcome.
- Mommy!

468
00:17:57,291 --> 00:18:00,708
♪ A kingdom of isolation ♪

469
00:18:02,396 --> 00:18:04,865
(laughing)

470
00:18:04,865 --> 00:18:05,823
- Gotcha!

471
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:08,073
Oh I think you're injected.

472
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:10,416
Holy cow.

473
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:11,416
Do it again.

474
00:18:19,193 --> 00:18:20,884
- Well three of the
kids were sick yesterday

475
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:22,456
and then Elise was sick this morning

476
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:24,773
and was finally feeling
better this afternoon

477
00:18:24,773 --> 00:18:26,130
and I'm so glad that we
waited to open presents

478
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:27,460
until everybody was feeling better,

479
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,568
because now everyone is loving
getting out their presents

480
00:18:30,568 --> 00:18:32,034
and just enjoying them.

481
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,998
- I'm talking to ya.

482
00:18:33,998 --> 00:18:35,915
Just don't let me down.

483
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:40,705
I'm talking to ya.

484
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,456
I'm talking to ya.

485
00:18:42,456 --> 00:18:44,373
Just don't let me down!

486
00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,461
- [Jeremy] I love your music buddy.

487
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,530
- Thanks.

488
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,383
- [Jeremy] Kinda reminds me of 21 Pilots.

489
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:51,216
- [Kendra] Are you excited?

490
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:52,049
- Yeah.

491
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,633
- [Kendra] Are you gonna
give everybody your presents?

492
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,466
- Yes.

493
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,545
- Alright, come give 'em out.

494
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:57,722
This one says to Daddy.

495
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,080
- [Jeremy] Thank you.

496
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,163
- This one says to Isaac.

497
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:03,273
- [Laura] It's a baby.

498
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:05,666
- Oh, don't tell, don't tell.

499
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,166
Go sit by Caleb and watch him.

500
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,936
(laughing)

501
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:13,328
Yay.

502
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:16,230
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

503
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,516
- This will end up being
a very funny memory.

504
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:21,176
- [Kendra] Yes, it will be.

505
00:19:21,176 --> 00:19:24,346
- (gasps) Oh my goodness.

506
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,122
It's an ice cream come.

507
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:27,613
It's got blue on it.

508
00:19:27,613 --> 00:19:28,673
- Yeah.
- And sprinkles.

509
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:31,590
(toy squeaks)
Whoa!

510
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:35,412
This is definitely a dog toy.

511
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,723
- Yes it is.

512
00:19:37,723 --> 00:19:40,473
(all laughing)

513
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:41,755
(Jeremy gasps)

514
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:42,884
- [Kendra] Whoa.

515
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:45,275
- I like that.
- Mickey!

516
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:46,668
- That's yours.

517
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:47,501
- It's mine.

518
00:19:47,501 --> 00:19:49,910
I use a lot of Kleenex.

519
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,248
- You could blow nose on it.

520
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,665
- I could blow my nose on it.

521
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:58,958
(all giggling)

522
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:02,789
- You did a good job wrapping it.

523
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:06,872
- Um hmm, I'm really good
at wrapping flat stuff.

524
00:20:07,868 --> 00:20:09,809
- The sticker collection.

525
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:10,642
Thanks.

526
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:15,358
- (gasps) Dark chocolate bar, yes!

527
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,675
I love dark chocolate.

528
00:20:16,675 --> 00:20:17,526
- Can you share?

529
00:20:17,526 --> 00:20:21,282
- Every second you go to
the counter and take a--

530
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:23,340
- Wait, don't reveal mom's secrets.

531
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,708
- I may have a hiding spot
for chocolate in our house.

532
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:28,174
And I like my chocolate, don't I?

533
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,257
- I always see you do it.

534
00:20:31,358 --> 00:20:33,684
- (gasps) A vase.

535
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:34,981
Buddy that's awesome.

536
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:35,952
Thank you.

537
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:37,531
- I've been wondering if it was a vase

538
00:20:37,531 --> 00:20:39,219
or something you drink out of.

539
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:41,849
(Jeremy and Kendra laughing)

540
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,750
- [Jeremy] He got you a big cup.

541
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,456
- You didn't know if
it was a cup or a vase?

542
00:20:45,456 --> 00:20:48,873
- I kind of more thought on the cup side.

543
00:20:50,511 --> 00:20:52,219
- [Jeremy] So you have to drink out of it.

544
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:53,150
- Wouldn't that be kind of a painful cup

545
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,634
to drink out of?

546
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:57,854
- [Jeremy] Nope, you not
have to drink out of it.

547
00:20:57,854 --> 00:20:59,835
- Thanks for the cup Isaac.

548
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,899
(laughing)

549
00:21:01,899 --> 00:21:02,884
- [Jeremy] Multi-purpose.

550
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:06,042
(Laura yells)

551
00:21:06,042 --> 00:21:07,802
(kids laughing)

552
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:08,885
- A football!

553
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:11,997
I think every year I get
a football from Isaac.

554
00:21:11,997 --> 00:21:13,396
- [Kendra] It's tradition.

555
00:21:13,396 --> 00:21:14,321
- Last year I got it.

556
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,352
- Go deep, go deep.

557
00:21:15,352 --> 00:21:17,420
- Last year I got you a Snickers.

558
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,693
- Well that's true.

559
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:21,566
- So growing up, us kids
gave my dad black socks

560
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:22,932
every year for Christmas.

561
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:24,856
And every year he acted surprised.

562
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:27,860
And now, our kids have
given Jeremy a football,

563
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,335
like every year for Christmas
for the last several years.

564
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:31,364
But he loves it.

565
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,754
So I just, I love that.

566
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:34,428
Do you guys have a gift
like that in your family

567
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,257
where somebody gets it every single year?

568
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:37,597
- [Kids] J House out.

569
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:41,141
- Since Jesus is Mary
and Joseph's daughter.

570
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,369
(all laughing)

571
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,952
(bright music)

572
00:21:47,354 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Woman] God loves you.
