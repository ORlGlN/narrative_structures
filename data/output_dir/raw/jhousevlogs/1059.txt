1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,893
- [Female Narrator] Caleb did
you offer to feed baby Laura?

2
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:06,468
- Yeah, she see my nipples?

3
00:00:06,468 --> 00:00:08,754
- [Female Narrator]
Yeah, do you have milk.

4
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:10,841
- Yeah, see them?

5
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,824
- [Female Narrator] Where's your milk?

6
00:00:12,824 --> 00:00:13,957
- In my nipples.

7
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:14,971
- [Female Narrator] In your what?

8
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,353
- In my nipples?

9
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:17,485
- [Female Narrator] In your mipples?

10
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,461
- Yeah.

11
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:21,044
(upbeat music)

12
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,646
- So far three out of three of our kids

13
00:00:46,646 --> 00:00:48,919
have been scared of the vacuum as babies.

14
00:00:48,919 --> 00:00:52,225
This little girls just crawled from all

15
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:55,043
the way down the hall
and she is booking it.

16
00:00:55,043 --> 00:00:59,210
(vacuum running) Now she can play.

17
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:07,692
Is it fun to drive with the windows down?

18
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,719
- [Children] Yeah.

19
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,962
- [Kendra] We don't get to
do that very often do we?

20
00:01:09,962 --> 00:01:12,333
- And we're even playing.

21
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,510
- Cause I'm.

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,331
- We're even get to putting our hands out.

23
00:01:16,331 --> 00:01:18,365
- I got some in my mouth.

24
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:22,241
- [Kendra] You got some air in your mouth?

25
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:25,284
So Elise are you catching any more air?

26
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:26,166
- Uh-Huh.

27
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:28,123
- Look how much air I got.

28
00:01:28,123 --> 00:01:33,096
- Just a regular drive home
with these two crazies.

29
00:01:33,096 --> 00:01:34,834
I have to be honest though, I absolutely

30
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:36,762
love it when the weather is nice enough

31
00:01:36,762 --> 00:01:38,773
to have the windows
down when we're driving.

32
00:01:38,773 --> 00:01:43,773
- [Jeremy] Mom just realized
that I forgot the floaties.

33
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:45,473
That would've been a disaster.

34
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:46,404
- Well you know, they would've

35
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:48,877
just drowned, not a big deal.

36
00:01:48,877 --> 00:01:51,769
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you're looking hot.

37
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:55,071
- [Elise] I can swim just
a little bit, like about.

38
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:56,674
- [Jeremy] So we're at the party.

39
00:01:56,674 --> 00:01:58,253
Cubbie's feeling a little bit nervous,

40
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,228
what are you nervous about bud?

41
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:03,145
- (Whining), I don't wanna go.

42
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:08,110
- [Jeremy] He's traumatized by the

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,460
big Jake and Neverland Pirates balloon.

44
00:02:10,461 --> 00:02:11,960
He had a recent experience though right?

45
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,178
- He's nervous it's gonna pop.

46
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:16,395
He's not actually scared of balloons so.

47
00:02:16,395 --> 00:02:18,855
He had a recent experience
where a balloon popped.

48
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:19,688
- [Jeremy] It scared him?

49
00:02:19,688 --> 00:02:21,458
- It was traumatizing, ever since

50
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,917
then every time he's seen a balloon

51
00:02:22,917 --> 00:02:27,168
he's like this, he's like
gripping me, he's got a good grip.

52
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:30,085
(children yelling)

53
00:02:32,716 --> 00:02:33,794
- Dad's are so much more fun in the

54
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:36,637
water than moms, at least in my family.

55
00:02:36,637 --> 00:02:39,220
(guitar music)

56
00:02:40,284 --> 00:02:43,201
(children yelling)

57
00:02:46,963 --> 00:02:49,546
(upbeat music)

58
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,589
- [Kendra] That's so cute.

59
00:02:58,589 --> 00:03:01,172
(upbeat music)

60
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,982
(yelling)

61
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,021
- [Jeremy] Cubbie did you get some treats?

62
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:13,854
- Yeah.

63
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,170
- It's date night, yay, do you hear

64
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:23,130
that, it's the sound of silence.

65
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,624
- [Jeremy] There are no kids back there.

66
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,484
- [Kendra] Just empty car seats.

67
00:03:27,484 --> 00:03:29,130
- Well and for the last five months

68
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,513
or so, we've had to
take Laura on our dates.

69
00:03:31,513 --> 00:03:33,813
- It's true and even now when we do leave

70
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,954
her, we leave her for like an

71
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:36,052
hour and a half, so it's a.

72
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:38,848
- And we try to stay pretty close.

73
00:03:38,848 --> 00:03:40,682
- But still, it's the beginning.

74
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:43,265
It's a little taste of freedom.

75
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,977
- So one of the things that Kendra

76
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:53,986
loves to do on a date and I enjoy

77
00:03:53,986 --> 00:03:56,903
as well is going on walks and so we

78
00:03:58,118 --> 00:03:59,967
found a beautiful neighborhood up by

79
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,519
one of the golf courses here.

80
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,764
And we're just walking and talking

81
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,633
about what's going on in our life.

82
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:09,264
And what we're wanting to do, what do yo

83
00:04:09,264 --> 00:04:11,817
love about walking on a date?

84
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:15,150
- It's really relaxing and I like to see

85
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:18,601
different places and see different things.

86
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,886
I have always really enjoyed
different architecture

87
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,594
so walking through old neighborhoods

88
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:24,916
and new neighborhoods and
different things I really enjoy.

89
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:26,067
- We've never walked in this neighborhood

90
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,022
and it's been really fun to
see the different houses.

91
00:04:28,022 --> 00:04:31,073
- And especially if the weather's nice,

92
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:33,711
I think there's something
about moving and holding

93
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:37,878
his hand and just it's
just really relaxing to me.

94
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:42,521
- So, this is what
we're doing for our date

95
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:43,990
and I'm enjoying it, this is way better

96
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,948
than just going to dinner
or getting a movie.

97
00:04:46,948 --> 00:04:50,031
And especially if we're not fighting.

98
00:04:54,072 --> 00:04:57,870
Kendra is doing an ancient
folk dance from Austria.

99
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,585
- (Laughing) This is the don't get eaten

100
00:04:59,585 --> 00:05:03,181
by a bug dance, bugs,
I've been eaten alive.

101
00:05:03,181 --> 00:05:04,643
Like I love these lush beautiful places

102
00:05:04,643 --> 00:05:07,197
but we go there and I come home

103
00:05:07,197 --> 00:05:09,683
with 72,000 bug bites, it's true.

104
00:05:09,683 --> 00:05:10,843
- [Jeremy] It's true.

105
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,713
- And Jeremy has none.

106
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:15,013
- I can't figure that part out.

107
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:18,845
Maybe we use like the same soap
and stuff, do you use like a

108
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:20,080
special lotion or cream or something.

109
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,913
- No, even if we both use bug spray.

110
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:22,958
I just get eaten alive, what I've decided

111
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,541
is that the bugs know that I'm.

112
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:28,841
- Sweeter.
- Sweet.

113
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,034
- Look, it's pretty.

114
00:05:32,034 --> 00:05:33,066
- [Kendra] Nah, the camera's just really

115
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:37,434
not capturing it, ah there
we go, isn't that gorgeous.

116
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,470
- [Jeremy] And I love the little

117
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,158
flowers here in this roundabout.

118
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:44,420
- Ah, it's so pretty,
this is why I love walks.

119
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,886
Because I love being outside,
truly I'm a nature girl.

120
00:05:47,886 --> 00:05:49,089
I am, I'm a nature girl in my heart.

121
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:53,006
I'm just not a camping
girl and not a bug girl.

122
00:05:53,926 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
