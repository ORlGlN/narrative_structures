1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,880
- We've been having babies for 10 years

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,404
- That's true.

3
00:00:03,404 --> 00:00:04,237
- By the way.

4
00:00:04,237 --> 00:00:05,070
- Like we've had someone in diapers

5
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,903
- We were talking about that.

6
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:07,190
- For 10 years.

7
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,023
- It's been a decade.

8
00:00:08,023 --> 00:00:10,438
(Upbeat music)

9
00:00:13,486 --> 00:00:15,620
(Buzzing)

10
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,535
- What are you guys doing?

11
00:00:17,535 --> 00:00:19,618
(Guitar)

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,730
- So I'm having some spinach
and eggs for breakfast.

13
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,520
- And I am on day five
of my juice cleanse.

14
00:00:35,526 --> 00:00:36,380
- It's the last egg.

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,380
- And I want eggs but I'm going to hold

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,820
out strong and finish
off and then tomorrow

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,790
I will eat more normal food.

18
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:44,750
As a side note though, I'm about to lose

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,172
10 pounds, we'll see, I have one

20
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,140
and a half more pounds to go.

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,790
- I just did three days of the cleanse

22
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,270
and so yesterday was my first day back

23
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,988
to kind of normal food
and I've been really

24
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:55,130
appreciating how my body feels.

25
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:56,390
I did this cleanse because I wanted

26
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,810
to kind of reset my taste buds

27
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,440
so I didn't crave junk all the time.

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,230
And I am craving healthier foods

29
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,550
and healthier foods are tasting

30
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,650
sweeter and better to
me, which is awesome.

31
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,320
I have a terrible sweet tooth,

32
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,280
I always want sweets, and I've gone

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,060
four days now without any sugar,

34
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,560
and so, that's a big triumph for me.

35
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,345
So, it's been a good experience.

36
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:14,800
- (Jeremy) Sweet NayNay wants to play.

37
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,928
- She's doing it.

38
00:01:15,928 --> 00:01:18,511
(Violin music)

39
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,930
- (Jeremy) You did it!

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
You're a violinist! Okay, Isaac's turn.

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,180
She likes watching Isaac play.

42
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,763
(Violin music)

43
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,163
- Too long.

44
00:01:40,623 --> 00:01:41,760
Too long.

45
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,960
- Oh look, castle, so when the castle

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,400
is complete, look what letters you see

47
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,070
over here, big C, little C.

48
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,910
- I've been feeling a little bit

49
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,230
lost in life lately,
like, just a little bit

50
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,950
drifting, like I don't know exactly

51
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,620
what my purpose is or kind of what

52
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,500
some of my next steps are
with different things.

53
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,090
And that's always a great
reminder when I have that feeling,

54
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,890
that I need to be spending
more time with God

55
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,320
and so this morning, I
got to spend some time

56
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,140
reading in the Scriptures and praying

57
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,479
before taking care of the kids,

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,829
Jeremy gifted me that moment.

59
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,580
I put in ear plugs and just really

60
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,170
tried to focus on that and I feel better.

61
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,527
- Cut across

62
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:17,350
- (Jeremy) what are you guys working on?

63
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,306
- We're making a fake country.

64
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,320
- (Jeremy)Sounds, normal,

65
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,671
what's the name of your fake country?

66
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:24,624
- We don't know yet.

67
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:25,815
- Saturday City.

68
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:27,093
- No, that's just the main city.

69
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,838
(laugh)

70
00:02:28,838 --> 00:02:30,200
We're going to have football teams in it.

71
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,350
Okay, Caleb, that's the shape.

72
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,080
- Looks kind of like.

73
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,840
- She wants to play basketball.

74
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,692
She doesn't know what's going on.

75
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,040
(laughs)

76
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,850
- She saw me playing and she
was like, "I want the ball".

77
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,850
Okay, watch, NayNay.

78
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,110
- She wants the ball, she doesn't want

79
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,270
to let go of the ball, look at that.

80
00:02:51,494 --> 00:02:52,987
- She sees, she's like "I want to shoot".

81
00:02:52,987 --> 00:02:54,168
(baby talk)

82
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:59,168
- Get me up there.

83
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:02,640
Come on. Come on.

84
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,260
So, yeah, the other thing she loves

85
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,800
is the kids made this as a little

86
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,650
like hideout, play place for her.

87
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,433
Woo.

88
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:13,720
- She wants to see the
snake I put up there.

89
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,350
- A snake hanging from
the rafters, awesome.

90
00:03:18,995 --> 00:03:21,850
(laughing)

91
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:22,880
- Good one NayNay.

92
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
So, I'm headed to the gym this morning

93
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,210
to work out with my friend,

94
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,310
which I love doing, but
I'm looking all over

95
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,300
my house for my shoes,
looking, looking, looking,

96
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,640
my kids are all loaded up in the car,

97
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,050
'cause they're coming with me, finally,

98
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,600
I go out there to tell them
"sorry, I can not find my shoes"

99
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,566
guess where my shoes were, in the car.

100
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,680
(upbeat music)

101
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,621
- Post work out smoothie time.

102
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:43,204
(upbeat music)

103
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:47,661
- (Jeremy) I love your creativity.

104
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:52,236
- Thanks. I'm done. Ta da.

105
00:03:52,236 --> 00:03:53,069
- (Jeremy) A pineapple.

106
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,064
- Yup.

107
00:03:54,064 --> 00:03:55,437
- (Jeremy) We're doing
frozen pizza for lunch

108
00:03:55,437 --> 00:03:58,780
and she took it and

109
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,821
- I randomly asked dad if I
could have a circle cardboard.

110
00:04:02,821 --> 00:04:04,330
- (Jeremy) Yeah, that went with the pizza.

111
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,825
That's a great idea.

112
00:04:05,825 --> 00:04:07,800
- And I cut it up and ta da!

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,110
- I'm really excited because
I'm heading right now

114
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,390
to get my hair cut and it is long overdue.

115
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,160
I haven't had my hair trimmed or anything

116
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,750
for a while and so I'm just excited

117
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,360
to have it feel healthy and kind of

118
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,000
just fresh and taken care of.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,779
I haven't decided how
much I want to cut off.

120
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:23,190
I might cut off just like
some, I might cut off more,

121
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,610
I don't know, we'll see.

122
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,550
So, I didn't do my hair
today, so, I know it looks

123
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,670
kind of terrible in the before

124
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,631
but this is how long it is.

125
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:34,631
- They're taking all my string.

126
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:37,344
We're making a pattern.

127
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:39,172
- (Jeremy) A pattern?

128
00:04:39,172 --> 00:04:42,530
- Isaac, help me, pull this way.

129
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,680
- (Jeremy) What are you guys doing?

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,630
- We're having fun.

131
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:51,007
(upbeat music)

132
00:05:00,673 --> 00:05:02,680
- I feel like she worked
her magic with the curls

133
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,970
but this is what it looks like,

134
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,466
so, it's still long but
it's more manageable.

135
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:07,570
What do you guys think?

136
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,762
(All answering at once)

137
00:05:10,762 --> 00:05:12,890
It's somewhat shorter but not drastic,

138
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:14,141
like, I still have long hair.

139
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:15,090
- (Jeremy) It looks good.

140
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,062
- It's because she
curled it, she has magic,

141
00:05:17,062 --> 00:05:19,860
she knows how to curl hair just right.

142
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,850
So, I did a before, here's the after,

143
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,390
which, obviously my
hair is done this time,

144
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,660
so, it's not a fair comparison,

145
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,960
but I got 7 inches cut off.

146
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,270
While Jeremy has the
big kids out shopping,

147
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,450
Caleb wanted to stay home with

148
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,810
the little girls and play.

149
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:33,643
What are you guys playing?

150
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:34,476
- Magnets!

151
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:37,692
(baby talk)

152
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:38,534
- Yeah, that one's green.

153
00:05:38,534 --> 00:05:39,687
(baby talk)

154
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:41,896
- It's a green square. It's pretty cool.

155
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:43,250
(baby talk)

156
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,620
- I know, another green one.

157
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,480
- I made a pizza.

158
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
- Ooh, a pizza, what kind of pizza is it?

159
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,690
- Marshmellow.

160
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:51,100
- A marshmellow pizza?

161
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,075
Caleb, what are you building?

162
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:52,908
- A house.

163
00:05:52,908 --> 00:05:54,003
- A house.

164
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:56,586
(upbeat music)

165
00:05:58,576 --> 00:06:01,850
- Whoa, that's a blue square.

166
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,330
So, these three are starting
to play together sometimes.

167
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,000
And for the most part, it goes okay.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,990
Then we have some, like, sharing,

169
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,750
you know, grumpy issues
but it's really fun

170
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,446
for me to see them playing together.

171
00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:16,863
(rock music)

172
00:06:21,011 --> 00:06:21,990
- We're getting new shoes because

173
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,272
- (Jeremy) That's a hole.

174
00:06:24,272 --> 00:06:28,911
- I can feel the carpet, concrete, tile.

175
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:31,570
- (Jeremy) And yours don't
fit you anymore, huh,

176
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,900
just a little too small.

177
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,791
- Yeah.

178
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:34,624
- (Jeremy) Alright.

179
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:37,041
(rock music)

180
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,449
- Now these, are pretty
but they're a bit too big.

181
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:42,765
- (Jeremy) You gotta find em in your size.

182
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,182
(rock music)

183
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,860
- Okay, so, this toy is called Playmags

184
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,420
and we really like them,
we got them for Christmas,

185
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,070
like as a big family gift for Christmas.

186
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,877
I love these toys because all of the kids,

187
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,550
all the different ages of
my kids, play with them.

188
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,260
And the magnets are inside of the plastic,

189
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,630
and so they're safe.

190
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,970
- NayNay is forcing our
rule, if you get something,

191
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,816
I have to put it back.

192
00:07:09,816 --> 00:07:14,210
- Yep. So, since I told you
guys how well they were playing,

193
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,190
there's been several crying episodes,

194
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,580
it's hard to work with Janay
because she'll just take apart

195
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,550
what you're building
without her knowing it,

196
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,090
I mean, she's not doing it on purpose.

197
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,060
And then the other two
have to, you know, share.

198
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,381
So, lots of learning going on,

199
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:28,308
sometimes it's painful to learn stuff.

200
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:30,891
(upbeat music)

201
00:07:32,108 --> 00:07:33,750
- I tried on size two and size three.

202
00:07:34,584 --> 00:07:36,526
Size three feels a lot better.

203
00:07:36,526 --> 00:07:38,316
- (Jeremy) Cool, well,
they'll last longer too.

204
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:41,070
You grow, which you probably will.

205
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,430
So, with Isaac's sports playing,

206
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,605
he just beats up shoes.

207
00:07:44,605 --> 00:07:47,188
(upbeat music)

208
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,530
- This is it right here,
Revolution 4, try em on.

209
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,450
What do you think, do they
fit or are they too tight?

210
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,440
- Tight.

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,056
- Do you want to try a size two?

212
00:08:01,056 --> 00:08:02,430
- I feel taller.

213
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:11,770
- Alright, let's pack it up and go home.

214
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,700
So, Kendra came in here with Janay,

215
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,516
the other day and she said Janay was just

216
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:18,080
freaking out about all the shoes.

217
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,820
Get back on those old shoes,
let's go buy these ones.

218
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,210
So, they have a huge deal right now too

219
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,930
where it's buy one, get
the other one half off,

220
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:26,710
or something like that,
so, we like to save money.

221
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:29,210
- So, it's been a long time
since I've cut the boys' hair.

222
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,540
I used to cut it all the time

223
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,860
but they've been going to
a hair place for a while.

224
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,340
We don't have time today for that

225
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,960
and their hair is driving me crazy,

226
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,880
I don't know if it's hitting home

227
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,549
with my own hair cut but
I'm like "oh my goodness"

228
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,829
their hair is so long, they need it cut

229
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,890
so, I got out the clippers,
we'll see how this goes.

230
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,322
- Ready for this magic?

231
00:08:43,322 --> 00:08:44,437
- Yeah.

232
00:08:44,437 --> 00:08:46,543
- Alright, you gotta hold still.

233
00:08:46,543 --> 00:08:48,211
(laughs)

234
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,044
- Some hair!

235
00:08:49,044 --> 00:08:50,633
- (Jeremy) You guys have so much hair.

236
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,694
- They do have so much hair.

237
00:08:51,694 --> 00:08:55,259
- More hair! It's like
raining hair. Literally.

238
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,516
- Good job being still.

239
00:08:58,516 --> 00:09:00,599
(laughs)

240
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,993
- (Jeremy) That's pretty good.

241
00:09:07,993 --> 00:09:10,290
- I think you're good, high five.

242
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,677
My second victim, muahahaha, you nervous?

243
00:09:14,677 --> 00:09:16,330
- A little.

244
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,915
- You have thick hair, dude.

245
00:09:18,915 --> 00:09:22,777
- For some reason my hair
grows really fast. Hey!

246
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,300
- There's some hair.

247
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:28,300
It's funny, I always
think of Caleb as blondish

248
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,770
and Isaac as having darker hair

249
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,807
but I think Caleb's hair is
just as dark as Isaac's now.

250
00:09:31,807 --> 00:09:32,918
- (Jeremy) It's the same.

251
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:34,830
- It used to not be.

252
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,731
Crazy how long your hair was.

253
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,148
(rock music)

254
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,850
- (Jeremy) Do not laugh.

255
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,238
- That's like Isaac's special talent.

256
00:09:45,238 --> 00:09:47,245
(Jeremy laughing)

257
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:48,851
- (Jeremy) Do you remember
the try not to laugh challenge

258
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:53,140
where you started laughing every
single time we did anything

259
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,540
- Ready to make Isaac laugh?

260
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,483
- Knock Knock. Interrupting chicken.

261
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:06,046
(laughing)

262
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:12,166
- You look like someone different.

263
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,570
- (Jeremy) Haircuts can do that.

264
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,010
- So, Isaac's hair is a lot thicker

265
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:18,429
and it's proving to be a little
bit of a different beast.

266
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:21,016
- (Jeremy) He is a beast, a hairy beast,

267
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:24,135
with a hairy back, gross.

268
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:25,410
(Isaac laughs)

269
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:27,350
- So, you might be wondering,
since I cut the boy's hair,

270
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:28,910
why I don't also cut Jeremy's hair?

271
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,320
So, I tried that one time in college

272
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,530
and we decided that marital bliss

273
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,240
was more important than the
money we saved cutting his hair.

274
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,774
Meaning, it didn't go well.

275
00:10:36,774 --> 00:10:37,966
- (Jeremy) Gotta sweep you off, buddy.

276
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,450
(Kendra making noises)

277
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,458
(Jeremy laughing)

278
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,625
- Turn around.

279
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:47,260
Go take a shower, good job, buddy.

280
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,492
No wonder I cut these
boys' needed a haircut.

281
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:52,159
(playful music)

282
00:10:56,963 --> 00:10:59,750
- (Jeremy) How's it feel
playing in your new shoes, guys?

283
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:03,113
- Awesome. I can jump way better.

284
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:04,407
- (Jeremy) Your haircuts look great.

285
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:05,436
- (Isaac) Thanks.

286
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:07,510
- (Jeremy) Sometimes, I have to stop

287
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,690
and ask, how did I get this
supermodel to marry me?

288
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,770
- And it's the few times when my hair

289
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,165
and make up's done at the same time.

290
00:11:15,165 --> 00:11:16,158
(Jeremy laughs)

291
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,640
- (Jeremy) We've been
having babies for 10 years.

292
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,594
- That's true.

293
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,520
- (Jeremy) By the way. Like,
we've had someone in diapers

294
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,353
- We were talking about that.

295
00:11:21,353 --> 00:11:22,600
- (Jeremy) for ten years.

296
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,790
- Its been a decade of
awesomeness and tiredness.

297
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,061
We're boiling some potatoes for dinner.

298
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,894
- (Jeremy) Whoa.

299
00:11:27,894 --> 00:11:29,053
- And then

300
00:11:29,053 --> 00:11:30,590
- (Jeremy) Not me 'cause it's my last day

301
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,293
of the cleanse still,
so, I've been watching

302
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:37,106
the kids and family eat and the
ending of the juice cleanse,

303
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:41,540
I'm super excited to be
moving back on to normal food.

304
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,430
- He's been eating salads every day.

305
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,160
One salad, one salad.

306
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,500
- Here's our simple dinner tonight,

307
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,480
it's just baked potatoes
with cottage cheese,

308
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,519
strawberries, carrots, and bread.

309
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,019
(light music)

310
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:01,510
- I've now finished the
last juice of my cleanse.

311
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,330
J-House out.

312
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:08,887
- This is so cool!

313
00:12:08,887 --> 00:12:11,554
(playful music)

314
00:12:14,438 --> 00:00:00,000
- He's making a baby gate.
