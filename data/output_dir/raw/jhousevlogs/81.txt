1
00:00:01,124 --> 00:00:03,190
- [Kendra] This was discusting.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:04,885
- [Jeremy] Elise, what
happened to your glasses?

3
00:00:04,885 --> 00:00:06,255
- Jenae broke them.

4
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:08,716
(laughter)

5
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:09,549
- Yay!

6
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:14,202
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:17,918
She's dancing.

8
00:00:19,049 --> 00:00:21,093
Best way to start the day off.

9
00:00:21,093 --> 00:00:22,093
There it is.

10
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:29,911
Yeah, dancing while eating breakfast.

11
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:33,817
So I think Pentatonix is my favorite

12
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,768
Christmas music this year.

13
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:39,019
Sometimes I love Josh Grobin,
kind of a different style.

14
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:40,481
When I was growing up we had a

15
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,850
Beach Boys Christmas that I loved.

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,938
Let us know in the comments what Christmas

17
00:00:45,938 --> 00:00:47,981
music you love listening to.

18
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:48,814
- Daddy.

19
00:00:51,046 --> 00:00:53,629
(guitar music)

20
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:01,472
- So the church we go to
doesn't have a paid ministry.

21
00:01:01,472 --> 00:01:03,260
Everything is done by volunteer

22
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,760
including cleaning the church.

23
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:09,646
Alright you guys, this is our task.

24
00:01:09,646 --> 00:01:13,313
We're gonna clean the
outside of the church.

25
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,533
Pick up any trash.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,604
Alright, we gotta start
putting trash in that bag.

27
00:01:21,604 --> 00:01:24,021
(rock music)

28
00:01:36,116 --> 00:01:37,208
Good job team.

29
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:39,437
Let's see if there's other
stuff we can do to help clean.

30
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,318
So Elise, what happened to your glasses?

31
00:01:41,318 --> 00:01:43,524
- Oh Jenae broke them.

32
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:45,404
- [Jeremy] So how are you
keeping the glasses on?

33
00:01:45,404 --> 00:01:48,818
- I just hook it onto my ears, my hair

34
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:51,372
when I have a ponytail.

35
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,705
- [Jeremy] Nice.

36
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,547
Pick it up and throw it in.

37
00:01:58,547 --> 00:01:59,569
There you go.

38
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,401
Okay, watch out, this
one's just papertowels.

39
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,651
Go ahead Isaac.

40
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,603
Yeah!

41
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,553
If it has water in it and stuff.

42
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:10,386
Nice!

43
00:02:11,596 --> 00:02:14,179
(techno music)

44
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,036
So we were able to go
to a friend's baptism

45
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:30,892
and I had been asked
to give a talk for it.

46
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:32,587
It was a good experience.

47
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,306
It's good to think about my baptism

48
00:02:34,306 --> 00:02:36,001
and thinking about those kinds of things

49
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:39,918
just always brings peace
to my life and my day.

50
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,779
- When you help a baby
you just tear one piece.

51
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:47,703
- So we're watching
our kid's gift exchange

52
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:49,840
from a couple years ago.

53
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,905
So fun to see how little the kids are.

54
00:02:52,905 --> 00:02:55,155
(laughter)

55
00:03:01,705 --> 00:03:04,166
I'm so grateful that we've
captured these memories.

56
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,885
- So today we're working
on one of my favorite

57
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:07,162
Christmas traditions which is getting

58
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:08,718
ready for the kid's gift exchange.

59
00:03:08,718 --> 00:03:10,320
What we do in our family is in December,

60
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,502
the kids all work to earn money.

61
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:13,988
Then we go to the Dollar Store

62
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:15,637
and they buy gifts for each other.

63
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:19,027
I love seeing them
thinking about each other

64
00:03:19,027 --> 00:03:20,815
and working hard to earn money

65
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:23,532
and seeing the joy of
giving in their eyes.

66
00:03:23,532 --> 00:03:25,343
Today we're doing some
deep cleaning chores

67
00:03:25,343 --> 00:03:27,294
so the kids can earn some of their money.

68
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:30,800
This was discusting and
now it's getting all clean.

69
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,961
- Look at right there.

70
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,128
- [Kendra] Yeah, good job.

71
00:03:35,653 --> 00:03:38,230
- [Jeremy] Thanks big girl.

72
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,813
(upbeat music)

73
00:03:58,873 --> 00:04:02,031
- I actually all gotta get like the stuff-

74
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:04,747
- [Jeremy] The gunk under the table.

75
00:04:04,747 --> 00:04:06,247
Good job cleaning.

76
00:04:07,487 --> 00:04:09,113
Hello.

77
00:04:09,113 --> 00:04:10,854
- [Kendra] Are you little Minnie Mouse.

78
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:14,151
She's trying to get it off,
she can't figure it out.

79
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:15,939
Thanks, I'll get it.

80
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:18,106
She's like, what was that?

81
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,948
Nailed it, good job.

82
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,413
Now shut the dress up thing.

83
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:28,478
(guitar music)

84
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:30,196
- This is a fun job.

85
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:31,984
- [Kendra] I'm glad you like it.

86
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:34,567
(guitar music)

87
00:04:35,467 --> 00:04:39,995
Caleb is cleaning off
all of our condiment jars

88
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,272
and containers.

89
00:04:41,272 --> 00:04:43,246
So I just came to this spot in our fridge

90
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:46,497
and I'm feeling like this is
a little bit embarrassing.

91
00:04:46,497 --> 00:04:47,681
What do you think?

92
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:49,051
- I think we should keep it just in case

93
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:51,443
we run out of all of this.

94
00:04:51,443 --> 00:04:52,720
- [Kendra] Just in case.

95
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,997
So when we have more than we need,

96
00:04:53,997 --> 00:04:55,785
we just dump it into this spot.

97
00:04:55,785 --> 00:04:58,014
I'm just feeling like this
is a little ridiculous.

98
00:04:58,014 --> 00:05:01,317
I don't wanna throw it away
though, it's good ketchup.

99
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:02,150
Yeah.

100
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,757
- [Jeremy] Laura, you cleaning the van?

101
00:05:05,757 --> 00:05:07,784
- This is not supposed to be in here?

102
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:09,479
- [Jeremy] Oh no that is look.

103
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,545
It makes it smell good when
it smells funky in here.

104
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:12,378
Watch.

105
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:15,025
Smell.

106
00:05:16,398 --> 00:05:17,513
That's an air freshener.

107
00:05:17,513 --> 00:05:19,045
- Can I do it?

108
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:22,296
- [Jeremy] You can spray one or two.

109
00:05:22,296 --> 00:05:24,177
Well this week is supposed to be the last

110
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:26,220
little bit of warm weather.

111
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,149
We're enjoying it.

112
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:28,937
Look at the blue skies.

113
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,520
(guitar music)

114
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,226
- [Kendra] Good job.

115
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:38,666
So right now we're kind of all divided up.

116
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:39,688
We're working in teams.

117
00:05:39,688 --> 00:05:42,010
Caleb and I are finishing
cleaning up the refrigerator.

118
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:44,378
Isaac and Laura are cleaning
out the van and garage.

119
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:47,629
Leesy is helping us by
watching Jenae at the moment,

120
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,092
she's taking her turn.

121
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:50,949
And Jeremy is working on his office.

122
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,532
(upbeat music)

123
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,624
(piano music)

124
00:06:07,064 --> 00:06:09,642
- Feels good to have everything so clean.

125
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:11,778
To celebrate cleaning up
we're going to partake

126
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:15,377
of some of the popcorn
our neighbors sent us.

127
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:17,960
(guitar music)

128
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:24,154
- I like the caramel more.

129
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:26,964
But the cheddar's really good.

130
00:06:26,964 --> 00:06:28,334
- [Jeremy] What do you think Laura?

131
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,286
- I'm gonna go inside.

132
00:06:29,286 --> 00:06:30,470
- [Jeremy] You're gonna go inside?

133
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,492
Okay.

134
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,117
- Daddy, which one do you like?

135
00:06:33,117 --> 00:06:34,487
- [Jeremy] I think I
like the caramel better.

136
00:06:34,487 --> 00:06:35,927
- Yeah.

137
00:06:35,927 --> 00:06:38,594
- Look who woke up from her nap.

138
00:06:39,595 --> 00:06:41,987
Nae-nae, who is it?

139
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:42,987
Who is that?

140
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,210
- Well since Elise's glasses broke,

141
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,928
it's time to order a new pair.

142
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,879
So we have to decide on the style.

143
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,086
We're ordering them online.

144
00:06:53,086 --> 00:06:55,362
So they've got a picture
of Elise that we can try

145
00:06:55,362 --> 00:06:57,359
the different glasses on.

146
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:58,705
Do you know what kind
you're wanting this time?

147
00:06:58,705 --> 00:06:59,750
- Skinny.

148
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,352
- [Kendra] These are some of the ones

149
00:07:01,352 --> 00:07:04,092
that we've favorited as
we're looking through them.

150
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:06,259
Can we try this one Leese?

151
00:07:12,034 --> 00:07:15,609
- [Elise] I kind of wanted the
front to be just one color.

152
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:16,631
- [Kendrda] So you
prefer it when the front

153
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:17,839
is just one color?

154
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:18,767
- [Elise] Yep.

155
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,159
- [Kendra] So not this one.

156
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,326
These ones are light blue.

157
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:26,616
- [Elise] I like them pretty much.

158
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,288
- [Kendra] I think those
are pretty cute on you.

159
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:30,470
So this one's mostly clear.

160
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:32,328
What do you think of that one Leesy?

161
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:34,301
- It's not really my favorite.

162
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:36,252
- Okay, let's try another one.

163
00:07:36,252 --> 00:07:38,737
Alright, we found some skinny pink ones.

164
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,873
- [Elise] Do you think it looks good?

165
00:07:40,873 --> 00:07:42,312
- [Kendra] I think it's pretty cute.

166
00:07:42,312 --> 00:07:43,427
What do you think?

167
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:44,797
- [Elise] I like it.

168
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:48,814
I like it but I don't know
which color to choice.

169
00:07:48,814 --> 00:07:50,346
I want something different.

170
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:51,879
I like the blue.

171
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,546
Actually, kind of want the blue.

172
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,569
- You think so?

173
00:07:56,569 --> 00:07:57,562
Blue's your favorite color now.

174
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:00,046
- There's another one that has flowers.

175
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:02,763
- [Kendra] So this one
has flowers on the side

176
00:08:02,763 --> 00:08:04,388
instead of Hello Kitty.

177
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:05,503
How do you feel about that one?

178
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:06,432
- Happy!

179
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:07,709
- [Kendra] Okay, let's try it on.

180
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,079
- [Elise] Yes!

181
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,356
- [Isaac] It's the perfect frame.

182
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,470
- [Kendra] We did it.

183
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,492
- I'm gonna get it.

184
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,514
- Yes, we found them.

185
00:08:13,514 --> 00:08:16,788
So we were very, very excited
and relieaved to find those.

186
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:17,879
So we'll give them a try.

187
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:18,901
- Thanks for checking.

188
00:08:18,901 --> 00:08:20,526
- No problem, hopefully
they get here soon.

189
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:22,662
Jeremy and I are headed
out on a date night

190
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:23,847
and the babysitters are here.

191
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,217
Jenae is showing off for them

192
00:08:25,217 --> 00:08:27,353
and she is walking with the little walker.

193
00:08:27,353 --> 00:08:28,375
- I have to get my clothes on.

194
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,958
- [Kendra] She's going to town.

195
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:34,571
What!

196
00:08:35,457 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh my goodness.

197
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,333
Whoa, yay!

198
00:08:39,195 --> 00:08:42,097
So this morning I saw Jenae
take three steps in a row

199
00:08:42,097 --> 00:08:44,327
with this little walker thingymabob.

200
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:46,208
Now she's booking it.

201
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,158
Oh my goodness, this is going too fast.

202
00:08:48,158 --> 00:08:50,643
Are you wanting the tree?

203
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,664
Yeah.

204
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,963
The transformation is complete.

205
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,960
- Almost, I gotta get shoes on.

206
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,839
- [Kendra] What do you think?

207
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,756
She's excited about it.

208
00:09:05,225 --> 00:09:08,893
I know I'm biased, but I
think she's the cutest baby.

209
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:10,356
Oh my goodness, I said that about

210
00:09:10,356 --> 00:09:11,796
all my kids when they were babies.

211
00:09:11,796 --> 00:09:14,129
(screaming)

212
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:17,755
Come to mama.

213
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:22,988
- [Jeremy] Here it comes.

214
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:23,821
Yay!

215
00:09:25,287 --> 00:09:28,607
- So the kids haven't seen
Jenae's new trick yet.

216
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:29,440
Ready?

217
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:33,003
(giggles)

218
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:35,151
Look at her go.

219
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:38,334
(applause)

220
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,788
She's still going.

221
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,767
- She did it!

222
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,624
(applause}

223
00:09:47,624 --> 00:09:48,785
- [Kendra] Isn't that so cute?

224
00:09:48,785 --> 00:09:51,827
She is loving this and
she's so proud of herself.

225
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:53,197
She just wants to do it more.

226
00:09:53,197 --> 00:09:54,288
- [Jeremy] Clap!

227
00:09:54,288 --> 00:09:55,914
She's like, just put me down.

228
00:09:55,914 --> 00:09:58,164
(laughter)

229
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:04,046
(upbeat music)

230
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:10,682
- So we're cutting our datenight
a little bit short tonight

231
00:10:10,682 --> 00:10:12,470
because Jeremy's getting to go do

232
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,677
something with his brothers.

233
00:10:13,677 --> 00:10:16,069
- We're gonna go to Star Wars, the movie.

234
00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:17,857
- It's true, so he and I had dinner.

235
00:10:17,857 --> 00:10:18,971
Now are just-

236
00:10:18,971 --> 00:10:21,177
- Kendra was super nice too,
she's all encouraging me to go.

237
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:22,547
She's like you should go.

238
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:23,917
Wife points.

239
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,868
- He's gonna love it,
yes I got some points.

240
00:10:25,868 --> 00:10:26,982
So now we're at Target.

241
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:28,004
Where else would we be?

242
00:10:28,004 --> 00:10:29,490
- As soon as we're done vlogging,

243
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,369
Kendra celebrated that she
tricked me to not get a cart.

244
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:33,902
It's like an ongoing thing between us.

245
00:10:33,902 --> 00:10:35,248
She never thinks we need a cart,

246
00:10:35,248 --> 00:10:37,570
but then we always do need a cart.

247
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,403
So I'm getting a cart.

248
00:10:40,728 --> 00:10:43,956
- So check this out, it
says indulgent snack mix.

249
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:45,744
I could get behind that, like trail mix,

250
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:49,413
no I don't like that, but
this an indulgent snack mix.

251
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,549
It's got all these yummy different kinds.

252
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,105
- [Jeremhy] There's
like chocolate in there.

253
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:54,382
- Yeah, chocolate cashews.

254
00:10:54,382 --> 00:10:55,914
Everything in there's good.

255
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:57,540
- [Jeremy] Tis the season.

256
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,328
- I always wanted one of these.

257
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:00,349
It'd be so fun.

258
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,182
Oh look!

259
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,180
- [Jeremy] Don't we have
an electric one of those?

260
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,851
- We don't, well we have
a big standup mixer,

261
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:09,219
but that's just so fun.

262
00:11:09,219 --> 00:11:10,302
Look at this.

263
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:16,064
I think Jenae needs this in her life.

264
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,111
We found the wrapping paper.

265
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,574
- [Jeremy] We need some.

266
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:21,944
That's a lot of wrapping paper.

267
00:11:21,944 --> 00:11:23,291
- Over here.
- Whoa!

268
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:25,102
- [Child] Good night, J House out.

269
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:28,678
- [Kendra] This is just
wrong, oh my goodness.

270
00:11:28,678 --> 00:11:31,261
(techno music)

271
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,552
- You guys what we're gonna make today

272
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:36,503
is a fruit Christmas tree.

273
00:11:36,503 --> 00:00:00,000
(techno music)
