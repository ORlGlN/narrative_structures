1
00:00:00,464 --> 00:00:03,631
- We're doing the no thumbs challenge!

2
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:09,824
- [Dad] She's going in. She wants it.

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,904
(laughs)

4
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:18,400
- What?

5
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:22,060
- Hey dad?

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:22,893
- [Dad] Yeah?

7
00:00:22,893 --> 00:00:25,735
- Will you even be able to take it off?

8
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:26,814
- [Dad] Yes, for sure.

9
00:00:26,814 --> 00:00:29,896
- What will happen if
you won't be able to?

10
00:00:29,896 --> 00:00:34,063
- [Dad] Then we'll just, not
have a thumb forever, I guess.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,348
All right so we have a fierce competition

12
00:00:39,348 --> 00:00:42,209
between Isaac and Elise,
and how about this,

13
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,111
whoever wins, gets to dump a bowl of ice

14
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:49,080
down the back of the
shirt of whoever loses.

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,728
- Like actually like, you are like this.

16
00:00:52,728 --> 00:00:56,081
- Yup and the ice goes down your back.

17
00:00:56,081 --> 00:00:56,914
What do you guys think?

18
00:00:56,914 --> 00:00:57,747
- Good.

19
00:00:57,747 --> 00:00:58,873
- Okay.

20
00:00:58,873 --> 00:01:00,638
All right you guys ready
for your first challenge?

21
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:01,492
- Mmmhmm

22
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,608
- [Dad] Is the first person
to write your first name.

23
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:07,276
(playful music)

24
00:01:09,498 --> 00:01:10,331
- Done.

25
00:01:11,603 --> 00:01:15,374
- [Dad] Good job! Elise you're
so close look, there it is.

26
00:01:15,374 --> 00:01:17,707
Try to color without thumbs.

27
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:20,808
- A person.

28
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,397
- [Dad] Here's Caleb's drawing.

29
00:01:22,397 --> 00:01:24,841
Pretty impressive buddy.

30
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,295
I'm amazed, that was good.

31
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,577
- Here, here's mine.

32
00:01:27,577 --> 00:01:30,341
- [Dad] Oh, look at Laura's drawing!

33
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,273
Laura, that is beautiful.

34
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:35,523
First person to cut your paper in half.

35
00:01:38,784 --> 00:01:41,451
Be careful, don't hurt yourself.

36
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:52,186
Those are big cuts for both of you.

37
00:01:52,186 --> 00:01:55,603
She's using gravity. She's using gravity!

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,719
She's so close.

39
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,979
He's so close.

40
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,062
They're both right there.

41
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:04,909
Oh they've won it!

42
00:02:06,224 --> 00:02:07,751
She got it!

43
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:09,096
I don't know. I'll have
to go back and watch.

44
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,312
I was looking at Elise

45
00:02:11,312 --> 00:02:12,821
because she was so close and then I turned

46
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:14,716
and you got it, so maybe Isaac won.

47
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,637
We'll have to do an instant replay.

48
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,765
- I'm guessing I won but Elise could have.

49
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,113
- I kind of ripped it.

50
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:23,035
- Yeah instant replay, that'll be good.

51
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:26,785
(slow motion instant replay)

52
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:36,879
- [Dad] All right now let's
see if you guys can glue

53
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,796
one piece of paper on to the other.

54
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:43,717
- It's hard without a thumb.

55
00:02:47,082 --> 00:02:49,415
- [Dad] Who can do it first?

56
00:02:52,428 --> 00:02:55,650
Oh Elise got you on that one.

57
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,900
- Look at blue.

58
00:02:58,716 --> 00:02:59,633
- All done.

59
00:03:01,037 --> 00:03:02,287
- Peanut butter

60
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:05,534
- And jelly

61
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:07,929
(laughs)

62
00:03:07,929 --> 00:03:09,739
- Peanut butter

63
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,629
- [Dad] Your next task

64
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:15,129
- Make a peanut butter and honey sandwich?

65
00:03:16,313 --> 00:03:18,896
- [Dad] That's right, ready go!

66
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:22,824
- That is a really hard thing.

67
00:03:28,965 --> 00:03:30,632
- Ah, I can't do it!

68
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,033
- [Dad] There you go.

69
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:45,512
- I don't know how to open these.

70
00:03:45,512 --> 00:03:48,578
- [Dad] You got to turn it
in the right direction buddy

71
00:03:48,578 --> 00:03:49,745
to get it off.

72
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:54,219
- Done

73
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:56,699
- [Dad] Oh she wins!

74
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:58,366
It's now two to two.

75
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,945
- Could I finish because I
like peanut butter sandwich?

76
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,333
- [Dad] Sure!

77
00:04:03,333 --> 00:04:05,563
- Made a sandwich!

78
00:04:05,563 --> 00:04:07,455
Awesome taste!

79
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,372
- Mmm good.

80
00:04:10,141 --> 00:04:12,860
Best peanut butter sandwich ever.

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,054
- [Dad] How's your sandwich?

82
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,209
- Good.

83
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,748
I'm going to put honey on
the top so it's a little big.

84
00:04:18,748 --> 00:04:20,783
- [Dad] All right this next
challenge is going to be

85
00:04:20,783 --> 00:04:24,899
whoever can drink all of this milk first

86
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:25,732
wins!

87
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:29,971
- Good thing I'm fast at drinking.

88
00:04:29,971 --> 00:04:31,484
- [Dad] Ready, go!

89
00:04:31,484 --> 00:04:33,901
(fast music)

90
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,133
- [Dad] Elise wins again!

91
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,492
- Drinking breaths, breaths.

92
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:57,576
- [Dad] The score is Elise 3, Isaac 2.

93
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,452
- I don't have a napkin.

94
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,422
- [Dad] You guys have milk mustaches.

95
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:09,277
- How about the next challenge?

96
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:10,694
- [Dad] Ice cream

97
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:13,931
- Ice cream!

98
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:15,393
- [Dad] You've got to get
the ice cream lid off,

99
00:05:15,393 --> 00:05:17,606
you got to scoop the
ice cream into the bowl

100
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,505
enough to cover the bottom

101
00:05:19,505 --> 00:05:20,717
and then eat it

102
00:05:20,717 --> 00:05:22,651
and whoever does that first,

103
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:24,788
wins this one, okay.

104
00:05:24,788 --> 00:05:26,038
Ready, set, go!

105
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,427
(grunts)

106
00:05:38,812 --> 00:05:41,062
- This is a hard challenge.

107
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:54,071
- [Dad] You guys get enough to eat it now.

108
00:05:55,384 --> 00:05:56,640
- Okay, got it.

109
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,807
Just have to use my tummy.

110
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:01,559
(laughs)

111
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,165
- [Dad] Very creative.

112
00:06:03,165 --> 00:06:04,649
Just had to use your tummy.

113
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,265
(laughs)

114
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:09,601
You might need to use your
finger to get that off.

115
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,845
Good job.

116
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:12,224
(laughs)

117
00:06:12,224 --> 00:06:13,743
With her hands and her fingers.

118
00:06:13,743 --> 00:06:17,576
All right, that's enough
ice cream now eat it.

119
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:22,901
- Mmm good, it's really good.

120
00:06:22,901 --> 00:06:24,650
- [Dad] She's going in.

121
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,072
She wants it.

122
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:27,785
She wants this win!

123
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,750
(laughs)

124
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,750
He wants it!

125
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:37,703
You guys are going to
get brain freeze bad.

126
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:39,786
(laughs)

127
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:47,478
All right Isaac's almost done.

128
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,847
He only has one more scoop left.

129
00:06:50,847 --> 00:06:52,137
Elise's going for it!

130
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,220
She wants it!

131
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,153
(laughs)

132
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,691
You done?

133
00:07:01,691 --> 00:07:02,524
- Mm-Hmm.

134
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:05,744
- [Dad] And Isaac finishes the ice cream!

135
00:07:05,744 --> 00:07:06,577
Good job.

136
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:10,077
- I'll just eat the rest.

137
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:12,282
- I loved that one.

138
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:14,282
That time you were like,

139
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:19,754
I just got to use my fingers.

140
00:07:19,754 --> 00:07:21,973
(laughs)

141
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,186
Hey could I scoop some more?

142
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:25,436
Now I know that I'm good at

143
00:07:26,891 --> 00:07:31,058
scooping ice cream because I
could do it without a thumb

144
00:07:32,164 --> 00:07:35,751
- Well I know that I know
how to scoop ice cream out

145
00:07:35,751 --> 00:07:38,446
because I can use my tummy and my fingers.

146
00:07:38,446 --> 00:07:40,529
(laughs)

147
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,374
- Mmmmmmm

148
00:07:48,997 --> 00:07:50,998
- If you use your tummy and fingers

149
00:07:50,998 --> 00:07:53,184
you can get an ice cream.

150
00:07:53,184 --> 00:07:55,358
If you use your tummy and fingers

151
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,934
you can get your ice cream, oops!

152
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:01,698
- All right you are tied three to three,

153
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:05,121
so this is the final event and
determines who wins it all.

154
00:08:05,121 --> 00:08:07,667
You have to put toothpaste
on your toothbrush

155
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:09,941
you have to brush five times,

156
00:08:09,941 --> 00:08:12,157
one, two, three, four, five.

157
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,968
And then spit in the bowl.

158
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:17,506
Whoever's spit is on
the bottom of the bowl,

159
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:18,506
wins it all.

160
00:08:19,912 --> 00:08:20,745
You ready?

161
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,918
You can't touch it, hands on your lap.

162
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:26,668
(guitar playing)

163
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:32,694
On your mark, get set, go!

164
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:37,155
- Oh, too much. But it's all right.

165
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:40,155
- [Dad] One, two, three, four, five!

166
00:08:41,546 --> 00:08:42,756
Oh, Elise spit!

167
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,929
- Woohoo!

168
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,616
- [Dad] Good job Elise!

169
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:48,699
(slow motion replay)

170
00:08:55,181 --> 00:08:57,264
(laughs)

171
00:08:58,486 --> 00:09:00,736
(spitting)

172
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,736
- More

173
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:10,147
(laughs)

174
00:09:10,147 --> 00:09:12,035
- [Dad] So Elise did you think
that you would be able to

175
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,107
beat Isaac?

176
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:14,134
- No.

177
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:15,570
- [Dad] I'm so proud of
you, you worked really hard

178
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,522
and you were really competitive.

179
00:09:18,522 --> 00:09:19,355
Hugs!

180
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,236
And now, because Elise won,
she gets to dump the ice

181
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:27,819
down Isaac's shirt.

182
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:31,344
- Only do two at a time.

183
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,693
(laughs)

184
00:09:36,274 --> 00:09:39,835
- Okay you dump it down all in his shirt.
