1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,797
- They said I'm gonna have a sugar rush.

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:07,015
- We had a really rough morning.

3
00:00:07,015 --> 00:00:07,848
- Will flower.

4
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:08,681
- [Jeremy] It will be.

5
00:00:08,681 --> 00:00:10,452
- See this in movies so I'm trying it.

6
00:00:10,452 --> 00:00:11,458
- [Kendra] Oh no is it burnt to death?

7
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,041
(techno music)

8
00:00:17,975 --> 00:00:19,763
- [Jeremy] Guess what we did today?

9
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:20,596
- What?

10
00:00:20,596 --> 00:00:23,623
- [Jeremy] We finally got a merch store

11
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,416
with J House shirts, iPhone
cases, pillows, sweaters.

12
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,325
Do you guys wanna check it out?

13
00:00:29,325 --> 00:00:30,811
- Yeah.

14
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:32,925
- [Jeremy] Look at it.

15
00:00:32,925 --> 00:00:34,713
So if you guys wanna check this out,

16
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:36,094
it is in description box.

17
00:00:36,094 --> 00:00:39,869
We have been asked by viewers
for over a couple of years now

18
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,920
to finally do this and we finally did it.

19
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,360
What do you think?

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,544
- J House stuff.

21
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,600
- J House stuff.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,386
- Can we buy some and have them for us?

23
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:51,744
My favorite is that one 'cause it has-

24
00:00:51,744 --> 00:00:54,700
- [Laura] My favorite is that one.

25
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,070
- [Jeremy] You like the pink one?

26
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,903
- Yeah.

27
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:57,844
- [Jeremy] I thought you would.

28
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,516
Okay so again, in the description box

29
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:01,799
is the link to J House merch.

30
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,236
- The weather is amazing so Isaac and I

31
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:05,378
are heading out on a bike ride.

32
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:06,212
Ready?

33
00:01:06,212 --> 00:01:07,045
- Yeah.

34
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:08,003
- [Kendra] Let's go.

35
00:01:08,003 --> 00:01:10,586
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:13,445 --> 00:01:15,070
And it's really fun to have
a kid that's big enough

37
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,059
to not only keep up with me,

38
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:18,265
but it's almost hard for
me to keep up with him.

39
00:01:18,265 --> 00:01:19,519
I'm like, that was a big hill.

40
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,423
Slow down Isaac.

41
00:01:21,423 --> 00:01:22,491
You enjoying it?

42
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:23,324
- Yeah.

43
00:01:23,324 --> 00:01:24,157
- [Kendra] What do you see over there?

44
00:01:24,157 --> 00:01:26,181
- I saw a robin.

45
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:27,014
- [Kendra] You saw a robin.

46
00:01:27,014 --> 00:01:29,014
- Yeah and there's a _ .

47
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:29,847
There it is.

48
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,485
- [Kendra] Oh I see it.

49
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:33,259
Lots of birds.

50
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,977
Let's go, do you wanna lead
or do you want me to lead?

51
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:35,839
- I wanna lead.

52
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:36,672
- [Kendra] Awesome.

53
00:01:36,672 --> 00:01:39,255
(techno music)

54
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:49,677
We found a creek.

55
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:50,542
It would be so awesome to come back here

56
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:52,075
and go creeking with the
kids in their rubber boots

57
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:53,219
like we did the other day.

58
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:54,052
Might be fun.

59
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:56,635
(upbeat music)

60
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,703
So we're headed right now as a family

61
00:02:02,703 --> 00:02:04,386
to go pick out our Christmas tree.

62
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:05,895
Every year we get a real Christmas tree.

63
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:07,199
Unfortunately, we're not able to go to

64
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,360
the tree farm this year

65
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,404
but we're still gonna have
a good time picking one out.

66
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:14,687
And even more unfortunately,
we had a really rough morning.

67
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:17,576
If you've ever argued
with any of your siblings

68
00:02:17,576 --> 00:02:20,251
or disobeyed your parents
or not wanted to do chores

69
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,714
or teething.

70
00:02:21,714 --> 00:02:22,547
Yeah.

71
00:02:22,547 --> 00:02:24,637
Family life is hard sometimes.

72
00:02:24,637 --> 00:02:27,972
But it's worth it and
we're gonna recover from it

73
00:02:27,972 --> 00:02:29,639
and we're gonna have a great
time picking out a tree.

74
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,149
Here goes nothing.

75
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:35,149
(We Wish You a Merry Christmas)

76
00:02:43,779 --> 00:02:44,871
Smells like fresh
Christmas trees out here.

77
00:02:44,871 --> 00:02:47,219
Obviously but the smell's really strong.

78
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,566
- [Laura] Santa's boot.

79
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:50,739
- [Kendra] Santa's boot oh.

80
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,619
- This one's basically my size.

81
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:56,614
- I wanna find one for Caleb.

82
00:02:56,614 --> 00:02:58,315
One for Caleb.

83
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,815
Hey, I found mine.

84
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:03,934
- [Jeremy] Hi Nae-nae.

85
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:04,982
I think it would work.

86
00:03:04,982 --> 00:03:07,537
- I think this one's growing on me.

87
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:09,013
- So we've narrowed it
down to four options.

88
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:12,914
We have option A, which
is our roundest one.

89
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:15,787
A skinnier, taller one and
we have these two over here.

90
00:03:15,787 --> 00:03:17,620
This one and this one.

91
00:03:19,894 --> 00:03:21,404
The one thing I like about this one is how

92
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:23,812
tall it is off the ground for Jenae.

93
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:24,997
- So now all we have to do is

94
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,526
have all six of us agree on one.

95
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:27,966
That'll be easy.

96
00:03:27,966 --> 00:03:30,216
(laughter)

97
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,806
(cheers)

98
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,246
We decided.

99
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:38,579
- [Jeremy] What should we name our tree?

100
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,059
We already have a tree named George.

101
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,892
(Christmas music)

102
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:52,059
There we go.

103
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:54,679
- The top is spinning.

104
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:57,512
(Christmas music)

105
00:04:13,827 --> 00:04:15,894
- [Jeremy] Did we get a tree?

106
00:04:15,894 --> 00:04:17,082
- So apparently it's
the right time of year

107
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:19,404
to plant bulbs for flowers
to come up in the spring.

108
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:20,237
I've never done that before,

109
00:04:20,237 --> 00:04:21,332
but I've always wanted to try it.

110
00:04:21,332 --> 00:04:22,934
So I think we're gonna try it this year.

111
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:24,471
- This one.

112
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,999
- [Kendra] You think
that one looks so fun.

113
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:28,137
- Or these.

114
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:30,479
- This United States one.

115
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,105
- I think these ones are pretty.

116
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,800
- [Caleb] I like red shine.

117
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,958
- I like red shine.

118
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,676
- I like those two.

119
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:38,813
- [Jeremy] I think we
should get these ones.

120
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:41,646
(Christmas music)

121
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:46,812
I already have sap all over my hands.

122
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:48,339
It's fun.

123
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,172
(Christmas music)

124
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,158
- It smells so good in here.

125
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:59,573
I love the smell of real trees.

126
00:04:59,573 --> 00:05:01,617
Can you guys smell it?

127
00:05:01,617 --> 00:05:04,500
I think that they should invent
scratch and sniff YouTube

128
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,819
where I can video this
and you could scratch

129
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:08,421
your little screen and it would smell like

130
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,279
amazing Christmas tree.

131
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,719
Patent pending.

132
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:13,089
Alright, tighten them up.

133
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:14,980
That looks pretty straight to me.

134
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,932
- Sour.

135
00:05:15,932 --> 00:05:18,335
- [Jeremy] Is is sour?

136
00:05:18,335 --> 00:05:21,259
You're actually getting juice.

137
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,046
- I see this in movies so I'm trying it.

138
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:27,879
- [Jeremy] I think people
do it with coconuts.

139
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:31,241
What did you make?

140
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,324
Sticky thing?

141
00:05:36,338 --> 00:05:38,838
- Can I see how you made that?

142
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:40,965
You used this.

143
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,892
How'd you get pink on it?

144
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:48,851
Cool.

145
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:53,219
- [Jeremy] So what are you making?

146
00:05:56,304 --> 00:05:58,162
So beautiful.

147
00:05:58,162 --> 00:06:00,375
- I am sorting my clothes.

148
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,977
- [Jeremy] You're folding
them up real good?

149
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:04,194
Did your drawer get a little disorganized?

150
00:06:04,194 --> 00:06:05,861
Time to fix that up.

151
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:09,222
(rock music)

152
00:06:14,434 --> 00:06:15,267
- [Kendra] Caleb, whatcha doing?

153
00:06:15,267 --> 00:06:17,475
- We are gonna be planting bulbs.

154
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:18,778
- [Kendra] What is a bulb?

155
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,380
- It's a thing that sprouts.

156
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,398
- [Kendra] It sprouts,
what does it turn into?

157
00:06:22,398 --> 00:06:23,652
- [Jeremy] A flower.

158
00:06:23,652 --> 00:06:24,929
- A flower.

159
00:06:24,929 --> 00:06:26,468
- You wanna help move
some of this top stuff?

160
00:06:26,468 --> 00:06:28,186
We don't want it to come
on the grass though,

161
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,418
we just want it to scoot to the side.

162
00:06:29,418 --> 00:06:31,835
(rock music)

163
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,009
- I see the flower in it.

164
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,797
- [Jeremy] A flower will grow.

165
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:44,630
Go ahead and stick it facing up.

166
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,782
- Is this the flower?

167
00:06:45,782 --> 00:06:48,058
- [Jeremy] It will be,
that will be a tulip.

168
00:06:48,058 --> 00:06:49,225
- This is fun.

169
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,207
- [Jeremy] Cover them up.

170
00:06:53,207 --> 00:06:55,207
Get some dirt over them.

171
00:06:56,681 --> 00:06:58,701
You guys planted flowers.

172
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:01,284
(upbeat music)

173
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,916
This fell out of the fridge.

174
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:10,308
Kendra was grabbing something like this

175
00:07:10,308 --> 00:07:11,361
and I went to pick it up

176
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:14,444
thinking the lid would stay open, no.

177
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:19,514
The lid opened and all the
spinach is on the floor.

178
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:21,638
- [Caleb] What were we gonna use it?

179
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:22,471
- [Jeremy] I thought we would just

180
00:07:22,471 --> 00:07:24,888
let it hang out on the floor.

181
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,078
- [Kendra] What's happening?

182
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:32,282
- The tree is getting cutted open.

183
00:07:32,282 --> 00:07:34,032
- [Kendra] I know it's opening.

184
00:07:34,032 --> 00:07:35,889
Here's the funny thing Jeremy,
it's such a skinny tree,

185
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,953
it's like not even really opening.

186
00:07:37,953 --> 00:07:39,453
There you have it.

187
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,698
Kind of anti-climatic
because it's a skinny tree.

188
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:46,623
- It'll spread its wings a
little bit more than this.

189
00:07:46,623 --> 00:07:47,456
- [Kendra] I actually really like

190
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:49,035
that it's a pretty skinny one.

191
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:51,643
It's the softest pine tree I've ever felt.

192
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:54,221
- It's like fur, but
it's not a Douglas Fir

193
00:07:54,221 --> 00:07:55,183
it's like a-

194
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,668
- [Kendra] Great Frazier.
- Great Frazier tree.

195
00:07:57,668 --> 00:07:59,375
- [Kendra] Oh no, is it burnt to death?

196
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,232
- Just bubbly.

197
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,861
It's a little, I like crispy.

198
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,358
- [Kendra] Okie dokie.

199
00:08:05,358 --> 00:08:07,030
- It's a little crispy around the edges.

200
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,862
- [Kendra] I definitely forgot about it.

201
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey!

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,833
- [Jeremy] Just there so-

203
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,165
- [Kendra] We can just cut off the edges.

204
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,301
Apparently today is the day
for mishaps in the kitchen.

205
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,390
Salad and tortilla pizza crisp.

206
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,941
- So we're trying to leave

207
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:22,838
but Kendra can't find her shoes.

208
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,695
So I guess that doesn't
just happen to toddlers.

209
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:27,487
It also happens to Kendra sometimes.

210
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:29,600
She found shoes.

211
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,568
- They're a little bit of a necessity.

212
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:32,008
- [Jeremy] Good job.

213
00:08:32,008 --> 00:08:34,591
(upbeat music)

214
00:08:38,616 --> 00:08:39,731
- So the kids are gonna
play at Uncle Brent

215
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:40,751
and Aunt Michelle's house tonight.

216
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:42,121
And they have animals.

217
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,813
I just realized I don't
think Jenae's really been

218
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,531
around animals before.

219
00:08:45,531 --> 00:08:47,108
- [Jeremy] And we love
the Christmas sweater.

220
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:49,058
- Ivy's looking really cute.

221
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:51,641
(upbeat music)

222
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:02,222
Seeing Ivy in this sweater
makes me really want a dog

223
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,474
and to put my dog in a sweater.

224
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,913
That's just adorable.

225
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:08,496
(upbeat music)

226
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:10,524
- [Jeremy] Go get 'em.

227
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,383
- [Kendra] Oh she's on it.

228
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:13,716
- [Jeremy] Go get the kitty.

229
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:16,808
She's like, wait a minute.

230
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:18,891
Come on Mom, help me out.

231
00:09:21,366 --> 00:09:23,247
- [Kendra] Ivy, Ivy.

232
00:09:23,247 --> 00:09:24,497
That's a doggy.

233
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:26,930
Doggy's give kisses.

234
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,718
- [Jeremy] Close encounters
with puppies with sweaters on.

235
00:09:30,718 --> 00:09:32,801
- [Kendra] Oh nice doggy.

236
00:09:35,026 --> 00:09:37,943
- [Jeremy] You guys eating cookies?

237
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,759
- They said I'm gonna
have a sugar rush tonight.

238
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:44,710
I have some red frosting.

239
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,412
- [Jeremy] Oh, I wouldn't have
been able to tell otherwise.

240
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:49,721
- [Isaac] Yeah, look at his face.

241
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,021
- [Jeremy] How is the cookies?

242
00:09:51,021 --> 00:09:51,854
- Good.

243
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,716
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

244
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:57,890
She's still looking over at the cat.

245
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,051
There you go.

246
00:09:59,051 --> 00:09:59,884
- So soft.

247
00:10:03,248 --> 00:10:04,457
What was that?

248
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:06,895
- [Jeremy] I got hair on my hand.

249
00:10:06,895 --> 00:10:10,145
- [Kendra] Oh she wants to do it again.

250
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:16,027
It seems like Jenae likes animals,

251
00:10:16,027 --> 00:10:18,507
but I'm a little bit
nervous about having one

252
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:20,595
of our own because she
would attack the animal.

253
00:10:20,595 --> 00:10:23,335
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

254
00:10:23,335 --> 00:10:24,235
- Gingerbread houses.

255
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:25,187
- Butter cookies.

256
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:28,136
- [Kendra] Butter cookies?

257
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:28,969
Caught ya.

258
00:10:31,202 --> 00:10:32,874
So you guys get to build a device

259
00:10:32,874 --> 00:10:34,884
that can safely carry your cookie.

260
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,296
- [Child] One, two, three, drop.

261
00:10:38,296 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] These pajamas make me so happy.
