in honor of your birthday.

Sorry we can't share any of it with you.

10
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:16,263
How is it, Cubby?

11
00:00:16,263 --> 00:00:17,096
- Good.

12
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:20,855
- Your arm is sticky?

13
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:22,045
- But that's okay.

14
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:22,878
- What are we gonna do if

15
00:00:22,878 --> 00:00:24,651
your face gets all sticky too?

00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:35,151
No!

21
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:36,375
At me?

22
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:37,208
(family laughs)

23
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:38,041
No no no!

24
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,335
I have a baby, I have a baby!

No!

26
00:00:44,051 --> 00:00:44,884
At me?

27
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,380
- I don't think I got any of that!

28
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,250
(family laughs)

29
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,083
Whoa!
