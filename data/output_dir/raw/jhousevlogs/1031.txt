00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:04,599
(Mother and Kids singing Happy Birthday)

2
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,076
(exhales through nose)

3
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:27,653
- [Mother] Oh sick!

4
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,770
I guess you didn't want to have to

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,847
share those cinnamon rolls!

6
00:00:30,847 --> 00:00:33,636
- I guess my nose was clogged.

7
00:00:33,636 --> 00:00:34,674
- [Mother] That is sick.

8
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:37,758
- I was gonna try to blow
it out with my nose air,

9
00:00:37,758 --> 00:00:39,508
but I wasn't able to.

10
00:00:41,682 --> 00:00:43,118
- [Mother] Very nice,

11
00:00:43,118 --> 00:00:46,371
and no one can taste
daddy's cinnamon rolls.

12
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:48,204
- That's embarrassing.

13
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:52,823
(upbeat violin music)

14
00:01:14,572 --> 00:01:16,072
- I love my daddy.

15
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:25,306
- [Kendra] Did you get a sour one?

16
00:01:25,306 --> 00:01:26,723
- Cracking a egg!

17
00:01:28,757 --> 00:01:30,174
- So you do this.

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,193
Good job.

19
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,580
- Alright Isaac let's see it.

20
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:59,157
Heeeey, nice work.

21
00:02:01,148 --> 00:02:04,565
Okay, I think we got the Sprite in there.

22
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,104
What are you guys plugging your ears for?

23
00:02:08,104 --> 00:02:11,438
- Yeah it, it makes a pretty cool sound.

24
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:14,391
- [Kendra] What's it gonna do, Caleb?

25
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:15,808
- Make a esplode.

26
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:21,814
- [Jeremy] He thinks it's gonna explode.

27
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:23,789
- Alright guys then you're
gonna be pretty excited

28
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:26,706
to see what happens, are you ready?

29
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:34,561
(Jeremy mimics explosion)

30
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:36,186
- Yeah.

31
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:37,338
It wasn't loud.

32
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:39,214
- It wasn't loud.

33
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:42,631
- So for my birthday my family came over.

34
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,140
So this is my brother Brent.

35
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,307
So over the last month I've
introduced Brent a couple times.

36
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:00,614
I'm not gonna edit you out this time,

37
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,281
I'm actually gonna keep this in.

38
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:05,676
So we'll keep being at different events

39
00:03:05,676 --> 00:03:09,322
that I end up not throwing in the vlog.

40
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,173
- [Kendra] Hi Brent and Michelle.

41
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:11,090
- Hey guys.

42
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:15,442
- So this is my brother Brent.

43
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:16,846
I've introduced him like seven times

44
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,525
but then I edit him out every time.

45
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:21,122
This is Brent.

46
00:03:21,122 --> 00:03:22,092
- [Kendra] We'll edit him out.

47
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:25,914
- Yeah we're gonna edit
you out this time again.

48
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,616
I'm gonna keep the birthday in.

49
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,834
- I'm just not up to par I guess.

50
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,174
- You guys.

51
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,831
- I'm so excited!

52
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,408
- I'm finally gonna be in the video.

53
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:38,626
- We have to, we can't
cut him out this time.

54
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:41,220
So tell us what you did.

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,369
- So I was informed after
my son went to the bathroom

56
00:03:44,369 --> 00:03:45,313
- Number two.

57
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:47,942
- That this toilet was out of commission

58
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:50,934
because somebody had previously flushed

59
00:03:50,934 --> 00:03:54,060
at least three toothbrushes
down the toilet.

60
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,949
- We've been wanting
to like tape it closed.

61
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:00,632
- So since my son was
responsible for using it,

62
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:02,902
I felt I should help plunge it,

63
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:05,020
and fortunately while I was plunging.

64
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:08,520
- Wait let's see, let's see what happened.

65
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:12,390
It's been so hard to not have

66
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,133
a bathroom toilet for the kids.

67
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:19,458
- So I was plunging and
plunging, I was almost done,

68
00:04:19,458 --> 00:04:22,543
and then all of a sudden
one of those toothbrushes

69
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:25,617
floated back up into the toilet,

70
00:04:25,617 --> 00:04:29,125
so then I just kept going,
the other two came up also.

71
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,855
- There might be more,

72
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:32,468
y'know who knows what else is down there,

73
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:33,686
but at least we have three.

74
00:04:33,686 --> 00:04:36,003
- If attorney-ing doesn't work for me,

75
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:38,776
I've got plumbing in my future.

76
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:40,109
- [Kendra] Yell.

77
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:41,929
Jump rope.

78
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:49,823
Monster.

79
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:50,656
- Beast.

80
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,862
- [Jeremy] Cup, football, hike, center.

81
00:04:56,862 --> 00:04:58,362
You're the center.

82
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:04,690
- [Woman] Pocket knife.

83
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:07,717
- [Jeremy] Jackknife.

84
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:11,732
- [Woman] Sleeve.

85
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,920
- [Jeremy] Calculator, calculate.

86
00:05:19,338 --> 00:05:21,043
Secret, whisper.

87
00:05:21,043 --> 00:05:22,708
- [Brent] Rumor, gossip.

88
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,458
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

89
00:05:26,488 --> 00:05:27,905
- [Brent] Poison.

90
00:05:31,295 --> 00:05:33,795
- [Jeremy] Cubby you guessing?

91
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:37,594
Bird!

92
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:38,538
- [Woman] Fly!

93
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:40,933
- Yes, fly fly fly.

94
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:41,766
- C'mere.

95
00:05:45,146 --> 00:05:45,979
Bigamist.

96
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:50,961
- [Jeremy] Well that
would have been tough.

97
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,687
Dance, he's dancing, we got it!

98
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,749
Baby!

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,250
Good job, hit it again bud.

100
00:06:09,404 --> 00:06:10,313
Snake!

101
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:11,730
- [Woman] Animal!

102
00:06:15,352 --> 00:06:16,710
- Hee haw.

103
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,645
- [Kendra] A donkey, a donkey!

104
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,427
Ballerina, ballet.

105
00:06:21,427 --> 00:06:23,010
- It was ballerina.

106
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:28,596
- [Woman] Whale, air hole.

107
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,263
- [Kendra] Airplane, shark, fin.

108
00:06:32,198 --> 00:06:34,115
- [Jeremy] Oh, harpoon.

109
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,652
Oh a sting ray!

110
00:06:37,652 --> 00:06:39,069
- [Kendra] What?!

111
00:06:41,256 --> 00:06:42,665
Sassy.

112
00:06:42,665 --> 00:06:44,849
- [Jeremy] Stripper!

113
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,833
- [Boy] You should have pointed at Caleb!

114
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,293
- [Kendra] I should have pointed at Caleb.

115
00:06:49,293 --> 00:06:51,798
- I think we just went to PG-13.

116
00:06:51,798 --> 00:06:54,398
Brent, this is why we
edit you out every time.

117
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,815
You're so gross and immature.

118
00:06:58,953 --> 00:07:00,684
- Is it time to eat cake?

119
00:07:00,684 --> 00:07:04,101
(singing Happy Birthday)

120
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,703
(clapping, cheering)

121
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:31,515
- Why do people have candles
and have fire on them

122
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:36,215
and blow them out, why do they do that?

123
00:07:36,215 --> 00:07:37,923
- [Jeremy] What do you think, Caleb,

124
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,043
why do we have candles and fire

125
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,960
and blow 'em out for our birthdays?

126
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:58,654
- And so we can make a wish.

127
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:00,535
- [Jeremy] Do you understand now?

128
00:08:00,535 --> 00:08:03,618
- But there should be another reason.

129
00:08:04,677 --> 00:08:08,177
Like why do we blow it out to make a wish,

130
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,686
why would we do it?

131
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:12,294
- We're gonna have to
work on teaching them

132
00:08:12,294 --> 00:00:00,000
not to talk while they're eating.
