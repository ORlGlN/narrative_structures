00:00:08,827 --> 00:00:11,160

in Arizona, I'm getting all packed up.

10
00:00:21,952 --> 00:00:23,032
See that suitcase?

00:00:23,032 --> 00:00:24,299
It's about ready to get closed,

00:00:24,299 --> 00:00:26,183
and we are going to be heading out.

13
00:00:26,183 --> 00:00:27,216
The first stop of the day

00:00:27,216 --> 00:00:28,719
is at the cardiologist,

15
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,021

so we gotta fold all the laundry

21
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:47,049

- [Kendra] Here at my mom's house,

00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,398
she has the coolest picture corner

46
00:01:57,398 --> 00:02:00,200
and it's just full of all
these family pictures.

47
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,452
Some of the pictures are older.

48
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:02,492
See that girl on the left,

49
00:02:02,492 --> 00:02:04,111
that's my Grandma Kris.

50
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:07,437
There's my dad, when he
was a baseball player

51
00:02:07,437 --> 00:02:08,548
in his youth.

52
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:10,770
That's my other grandparents
on their wedding day.

53
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,742
There's Marla, graduating
from high school.

54
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,718
There's my parents.

55
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:18,935
And this is the one I
wanted to show you guys.

56
00:02:18,935 --> 00:02:20,572
This is my older sister Tiffany,

57
00:02:20,572 --> 00:02:22,849
and I, and I am like two and a half

58
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,161
or three years old in that picture,

59
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,987
so I'm about Laura's age.

60
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,516
This little girl is my mom

61
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,859
when she was a baby.

62
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:31,244
I kind of see some Janae in there.

63
00:02:31,244 --> 00:02:34,411
(twangy bright music)

64
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:46,356
Here's what a normal
artery should look like.

65
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:50,377
Here's what an artery with
heart disease looks like.

66
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:53,280
My dad had a 100% blockage.

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,763
That's what happened, blocked artery

68
00:02:54,763 --> 00:02:58,132
leads to myocardial infarction.

69
00:02:58,132 --> 00:03:00,931
Wow that blockage is so little.

70
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,243
Well we made it to the
doctor's appointment

71
00:03:02,243 --> 00:03:04,915
and they just took an EKG on my dad.

72
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:06,833
And we're gonna hopefully
get some answers.

73
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:09,345
Janae's here supporting us.

74
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:11,227
She's been clapping for Papa.

75
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:12,324
(Janae gurgling)

76
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:14,460
Good job Papa, good job.

77
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,653
We're hoping to learn more about some

78
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,515
of the medications

79
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:19,163
- Yeah, the restrictions
- that he's on.

80
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,639
- Sort of, what happens from here forward.

81
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,477
- Yes.

82
00:03:21,477 --> 00:03:22,310
Papa wants to know when he can get back

83
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,560
to doing stuff.

84
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:25,358
- Yeah.

85
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:26,191
- Are you feeling well enough

86
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:27,024
to go out and like ride a bike.

87
00:03:27,024 --> 00:03:27,951
- Yes.

88
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,926
- [Mom] No.

89
00:03:28,926 --> 00:03:30,195
- Well that's how I feel.

90
00:03:30,195 --> 00:03:31,028
- Right.

91
00:03:31,028 --> 00:03:32,055
- I feel good enough to do that.

92
00:03:32,055 --> 00:03:32,888
I don't know if

93
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:33,783
- You're supposed to.
- If I did it,

94
00:03:33,783 --> 00:03:35,039
- it would cause a problem or not.

95
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:36,637
- So that's the questions
that we have for the doctor,

96
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:39,673
and Mom's feeling worried about him.

97
00:03:39,673 --> 00:03:41,937
- Yeah, if we can get
these questions answered.

98
00:03:41,937 --> 00:03:42,770
- [Kendra] Yes.

99
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,619
- [Jeremy] There's a loose loose tooth.

100
00:03:45,619 --> 00:03:46,452
- Uh-huh.

101
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,555
And it's been bleeding today.

102
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:51,075
- [Jeremy] It is so ready to come out.

103
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:52,908
- I'm scared about it.

104
00:03:53,914 --> 00:03:55,150
I want it to fall out,

105
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,377
but I'm just so scared.

106
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:59,330
- [Jeremy] It can be scary
to have a tooth come out.

107
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:00,297
I totally understand.

108
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,103
- And to have it pulled out.

109
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:03,143
- [Jeremy] But how can I help you?

110
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:03,976
- I don't know.

111
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:04,809
- [Jeremy] If you want,

112
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,372
I could put a paper towel in your mouth

113
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,205
and wiggle it a little bit,

114
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,807
and see if it comes out.

115
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:11,448
Do you want to try or do you want to try

116
00:04:11,448 --> 00:04:12,710
to do that yourself?

117
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,426
- I want to try to do it myself.

118
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:17,860
If it doesn't work, then I'll do it.

119
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,345
I want you to do it.

120
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,178
- [Jeremy] Okay.

121
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,619
Wiggle it a around, wiggle
it a little bit more.

122
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:24,619
Pull on it a little bit.

123
00:04:26,938 --> 00:04:28,642
You're being so brave.

124
00:04:28,642 --> 00:04:30,947
- I wish I could have a loose tooth.

125
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:32,493
- [Jeremy] You wish you could have one?

126
00:04:32,493 --> 00:04:33,592
How come?

127
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:35,925
- Because I'm a little girl.

128
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:38,542
- [Jeremy] You want to be a big girl?

129
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:39,375
- Yeah.

130
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,794
- [Jeremy] It's bleeding.

131
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:41,627
- Really?

132
00:04:41,627 --> 00:04:42,460
- Yeah.

133
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,168
Alright, Elise wanted me to
try to pull her tooth out.

134
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:46,001
You ready?

135
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:49,219
(suspenseful music)

136
00:04:49,219 --> 00:04:50,579
(laughing)

137
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:51,412
It came out!

138
00:04:51,412 --> 00:04:53,186
(yells)

139
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:54,019
- [Laura] Is it out?

140
00:04:54,019 --> 00:04:54,891
- Yep it came out.

141
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:56,882
It didn't need much.

142
00:04:56,882 --> 00:04:57,715
You were so brave.

143
00:04:57,715 --> 00:04:59,865
Do you want to see the tooth?

144
00:04:59,865 --> 00:05:01,053
There it is.
- Can I see it?

145
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:02,774
- Yep, come see it.
- Can I see it?

146
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:04,934
- There's that tooth?

147
00:05:04,934 --> 00:05:05,767
- Hello.

148
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:06,687
- [Jeremy] All you want for Christmas

149
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,798
is your two front teeth.

150
00:05:08,798 --> 00:05:10,249
- Mmm-mmm.

151
00:05:10,249 --> 00:05:12,114
- [Jeremy] Mom's gonna be so wierded out

152
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,470
when she sees you tonight.

153
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,303
- Smile.

154
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:18,438
- Let's see it.
- What?

155
00:05:18,438 --> 00:05:19,620
- I like my new smile.

156
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,362
- [Jeremy] It's totally different.

157
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,987
Dad how do I eat?

158
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:25,724
- [Jeremy] It can be hard
to eat without that tooth,

159
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:27,724
yeah just figure it out.

160
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,190
- Ah.

161
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:33,446
- Well the appointment went really well.

162
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,899
I'll fill you in more on that later.

163
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,258
Right now we're gonna
go eat lunch at Zupas.

164
00:05:37,258 --> 00:05:39,535
I wish I could take this
whole restaurant home with me,

165
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:42,907
because I just want one
of everything, to go.

166
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,074
(elegant jazzy music)

167
00:05:51,928 --> 00:05:53,433
Dance it sister.

168
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,683
(laughing)

169
00:06:02,872 --> 00:06:03,801
We're at the airport

170
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,054
and I'm saying goodbye to my mom and dad.

171
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,957
And I'm so glad I got to come out here

172
00:06:06,957 --> 00:06:09,953
and just hug them again and be with them.

173
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,628
It's hard to live far away sometimes.

174
00:06:11,628 --> 00:06:13,780
And Dad, I'm so glad you're doing well.

175
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,075
- I am doing a lot better.

176
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,587
- I'm so glad.

177
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,789
It's a bummer, they had tickets

178
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:19,063
to come out and visit our family

179
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:20,015
in Kansas City this weekend.

180
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:21,528
They were gonna come to our one million

181
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:23,008
subscribers Service Celebration,

182
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:23,992
and the doctor doesn't feel like

183
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,184
they're ready to travel quite yet,

184
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,840
so they're not gonna be able to come

185
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,673
and meet all of you

186
00:06:27,673 --> 00:06:28,506
and hang out with us for that,

187
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,339
so they're bummed about that,

188
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,864
but we'll see them again soon.

189
00:06:30,864 --> 00:06:33,008
Wherever your family is that you love,

190
00:06:33,008 --> 00:06:35,785
call 'em, hug 'em, squeeze 'em,

191
00:06:35,785 --> 00:06:36,967
just take a moment to do that,

192
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:38,350
you definitely won't regret it.

193
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,173
The Phoenix airport is really big

194
00:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,478
and I've got some extra time,

195
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,380
I'm here early.

196
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,520
And Janae's sleeping,

197
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,402
so I'm gonna do some window shopping.

198
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:48,569
(twangy bright music)

199
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,257
So this is a morse code necklace

200
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:52,713
that says sister.

201
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:53,546
That's awesome, I want to get one for me

202
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,129
and all my sisters.

203
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,323
Um, these are adorable.

204
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:01,202
Okay that's enough to make me want

205
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:03,285
to have another baby boy.

206
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,363
Seriously?

207
00:07:08,464 --> 00:07:10,065
Okay these scorpion suckers?

208
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:11,121
That's crazy.

209
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:11,954
Would you eat one,

210
00:07:11,954 --> 00:07:14,537
because I definitely would not.

211
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:22,827
That's kind of cute.

212
00:07:22,827 --> 00:07:25,994
(bright upbeat music)

213
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:32,203
So I found a bookstore

214
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:33,825
and I'm just loving walking around

215
00:07:33,825 --> 00:07:34,777
looking at all these titles,

216
00:07:34,777 --> 00:07:37,050
and this one title caught my eye.

217
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,225
And I'm looking at it,

218
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,391
and I'm like this is the
book that I want to read.

219
00:07:40,391 --> 00:07:41,671
Here's the problem,

220
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:43,079
it's in Spanish.

221
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:45,277
So back in college, I took a couple months

222
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,735
of Spanish, enough to
understand what the title

223
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,719
and the cover of this book says.

224
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,566
I even was able to mostly
understand the back cover,

225
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:53,728
but there's no way I could actually

226
00:07:53,728 --> 00:07:54,561
read the cover in Spanish.

227
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,394
I just thought it was so funny

228
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:58,999
that I accidentally was browsing
in the Spanish book section

229
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:00,271
when I don't speak Spanish,

230
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:02,283
so I'm gonna have to find
that book in English.

231
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,708
This is the store Isaac would like.

232
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,875
(groovy upbeat music)

233
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:13,597
- So Elise is coming for her
last tutoring class today.

234
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:14,469
- Uh-huh.

235
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,102
- [Jeremy] It's so different
without that tooth there.

236
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:17,078
- I know.

237
00:08:17,078 --> 00:08:17,911
- It's crazy.

238
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:18,744
- I like it.

239
00:08:18,744 --> 00:08:19,744
- I love it.

240
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:24,979
So we may be way overdue
on a lot of books,

241
00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:27,907
so we're getting them
checked in to the library.

242
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,157
(bright uptempo music)

243
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,769
Look and see, where's the Phoenix one?

244
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:07,050
- [Isaac] Phoenix.

245
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,152
- Trick or treating.

246
00:09:09,152 --> 00:09:11,672
- [Jeremy] So Elise, what
are you excited about?

247
00:09:11,672 --> 00:09:13,816
- To tell Mom about my tooth.

248
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:15,066
Well it's gone.

249
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,951
- Mom's here.

250
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,386
- [Jeremy] That's Mom's plane.

251
00:09:21,386 --> 00:09:23,329
- I love Mama.

252
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,377
- [Jeremy] I love Mom too.

253
00:09:25,377 --> 00:09:27,877
(sweet music)

254
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:31,810
- Mommy!

255
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,060
(laughing)

256
00:09:36,478 --> 00:09:37,395
- Hi girls.

257
00:09:38,525 --> 00:09:39,555
Hi.

258
00:09:39,555 --> 00:09:42,560
Oh my goodness, what
happened to your tooth?

259
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,903
Do you want to hold her?

260
00:09:43,903 --> 00:09:45,420
Awww.

261
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,939
(kisses)

262
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:48,691
(laughing)

263
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,999
- [Kendra] Did you guys miss Janae?

264
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,000
- [Jeremy] Yes.

265
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,093
- [Laura] Yeah we did.

266
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,048
- [Kendra] Aww, you missed me?

267
00:09:54,048 --> 00:09:55,131
Thanks Cubby.

268
00:09:57,192 --> 00:09:59,863
Well Janae is pretty popular.

269
00:09:59,863 --> 00:10:01,188
Well she remembers you.

270
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,646
- I know I was nervous.

271
00:10:02,646 --> 00:10:03,479
- [Kendra] Yeah.

272
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:04,312
- And we did Face Time a lot.

273
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,795
- We did.
- To make sure.

274
00:10:05,795 --> 00:10:06,931
- She's excited.

275
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:10,681
Well we've got the whole
crew together again.

276
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,730
They have a lot of energy.

277
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,646
- Ya think?

278
00:10:14,646 --> 00:10:16,083
- There's a lot of energy at our house.

279
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,549
- A little bit more than Papa and Mugga?

280
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,163
- Yeah, just a little bit.

281
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:20,778
Janae's gonna be really happy to be home

282
00:10:20,778 --> 00:10:21,611
with all of them.

283
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:22,444
- Yeah.

284
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:23,312
- Jeremy's being really sweet

285
00:10:23,312 --> 00:10:24,825
and letting my have his jacket,

286
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,323
because it is cold here in Kansas City.

287
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:29,187
- I knew that you would need one.

288
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:30,322
Because when you left, it was warm.

289
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:31,851
- Yeah, I didn't even pack one.

290
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:33,359
Thanks Caleb.
- Or two, I don't know.

291
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,650
- [Kendra] Do you
remember where we parked?

292
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,918
- You know

293
00:10:36,918 --> 00:10:38,963
- Uh-oh, do we need to go back to two?

294
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:39,884
- [Jeremy] No.

295
00:10:39,884 --> 00:10:41,211
- Or is it on three?

296
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:43,090
- It's definitely.
- You parked at level one.

297
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,958
- Okay, now press two.
- Go to two.

298
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,791
- Three?

299
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,765
- Two.
- Two.

300
00:10:46,765 --> 00:10:48,978
- [Isaac] Please, I don't want
to be in the cold so long.

301
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,313
- [Kendra] There we go.

302
00:10:51,313 --> 00:10:54,136
- [Jeremy] So I think
it's actually that way.

303
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,288
- We're hunting for our van.

304
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,989
If we can't find our van guys,

305
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,315
we're just gonna have
to get on an airplane

306
00:10:58,315 --> 00:11:00,462
and go back to see Grandma and Papa.

307
00:11:00,462 --> 00:11:02,364
We tried level three,
definitely not level three.

308
00:11:02,364 --> 00:11:03,992
We tried level two,
(playful suspenseful music)

309
00:11:03,992 --> 00:11:06,830
and Jeremy's like clicking our van button,

310
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,193
no luck yet.
- I think it's over there.

311
00:11:09,193 --> 00:11:10,943
- I see it, I see it.

312
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:16,141
- [Kendra] Did we find it?

313
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,245
- Yeah, so I saw it,
but it wasn't responding

314
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,388
to the clicker because I was out of range.

315
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:24,160
- [Kendra] Hey Miss Laura, I missed you.

316
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,663
- I missed you too.

317
00:11:25,663 --> 00:11:28,550
I'm not gonna let you
leave ever ever again.

318
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,485
- [Kendra] You're not gonna
let me leave ever again?

319
00:11:30,485 --> 00:11:32,535
Come here big girl.

320
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,613
- That's a clap.
- Yay!

321
00:11:34,613 --> 00:11:36,514
(laughing)

322
00:11:36,514 --> 00:11:39,789
- Janae's so happy to
be back with her people.

323
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:40,622
So Laura told me she wanted me

324
00:11:40,622 --> 00:11:42,470
to read her a book.

325
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,951
I missed reading to you.

326
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,745
What is Mama Llama doing?

327
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:50,162
Baby Llama starts boo hooing.

328
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,164
Eyes wide open, covers drawn,

329
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,581
oh what if Mama Llama's gone?

330
00:11:57,589 --> 00:11:58,866
Llama Llama red pajama

331
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:01,366
Gets two kisses from his Mama.

332
00:12:03,354 --> 00:12:05,937
Snuggles pillows soft and deep,

333
00:12:07,155 --> 00:12:09,238
Baby Llama goes to sleep.

334
00:12:10,075 --> 00:12:11,835
Are you ready for bed?

335
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,313
If only it was that easy.

336
00:12:13,313 --> 00:12:14,436
It's gonna take awhile to actually

337
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:15,388
get the kids to bed.

338
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:16,221
J House out, goodnight.

339
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,815
So in Arizona, apparently they rake rocks.

340
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:20,227
And where I come from, we rake leaves.

341
00:12:20,227 --> 00:12:23,340
(bright music)

342
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,557
Well Papa is home from the hospital,

343
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:28,032
he's all showered up and
looking like himself again.

344
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:29,225
You playing with Papa?

345
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,069
Yeah

346
00:12:30,069 --> 00:12:30,910
(laughing)

347
00:12:30,910 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] Arms cuddle for bed.
