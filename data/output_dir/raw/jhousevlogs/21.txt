1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,101
- I'm so excited!

2
00:00:02,101 --> 00:00:04,684
(lively music)

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,161
- [Jeremy] Happy birthday!

4
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:10,542
- [Kendra] Whatcha doing?

5
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,577
- Sanding!

6
00:00:11,577 --> 00:00:12,530
- Janea is running.

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:19,602
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:29,548
(playful music)

9
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,730
Miss Laura, what are we
having for breakfast?

10
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,461
- I don't know actually know the name.

11
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:38,420
- [Kendra] It's called German pancakes.

12
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,920
- German pancakes.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,066
- [Kendra] How's breakfast?

14
00:00:45,066 --> 00:00:45,920
- [All] Good!

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,010
- [Kendra] What do you think, Laura?

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,470
- I like it, I want more after this.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,053
(upbeat music)

18
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,650
- Well, it feels good
to be back in San Diego.

19
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,000
I was up early this morning,

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,320
flew out here for a YouTube conference.

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,800
- Good morning, so Jeremy is gone today,

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,140
but there is something else
really special about today,

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,540
and that is that it is
Janea's first birthday.

24
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,640
Oh my goodness!

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,450
I have been so emotional
with this day coming up,

26
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,880
like I'm just not ready for it.

27
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,670
She's grown up so fast,

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,270
and it's just been such a joy

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,730
to have her in our lives this year.

30
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:27,210
Like, I look back over the year,

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,060
and everything from that first moment

32
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,400
seeing her and holding her

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,950
to her first smiles and
her learning to crawl

34
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,240
and her learning to roll over
and her learning to walk,

35
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,290
and it's just been a really magical year,

36
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,020
and so I think it's kind of bittersweet

37
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,590
to see it coming to an end.

38
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,580
We're not celebrating her birthday today,

39
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,570
because Jeremy's not here,

40
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,680
and we want him to be able to be here

41
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,110
for that whole celebration,

42
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,620
but it's just kind of
fun to be thinking back

43
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,610
to what was going on a year ago today

44
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,060
and everything that's happened this year

45
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,270
and kind of snuggling her
extra close this morning.

46
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,110
It's your birthday!

47
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,924
- Oh uh!

48
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:59,160
- [Kendra] Uh oh, she's like,
I don't know what that means,

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,256
but I'll keep playing. (laughs)

50
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,330
Look at that grin!

51
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,360
- Oop!

52
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,610
- [Kendra] Up, yep, what's over there?

53
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,860
You'd better go find out.

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,822
Are you going on a ride?

55
00:02:10,822 --> 00:02:11,655
- Uh huh!

56
00:02:11,655 --> 00:02:12,890
- [Kendra] She's loving it.

57
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,520
Lise, you're so nice with her.

58
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,180
- Turn around, shoom!

59
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,370
We're winning the race!

60
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,203
- So I'm at a conference called

61
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:24,500
Social Media Marketing World,

62
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,830
and it's a bunch of people in the industry

63
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,950
who are wanting to learn more about

64
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,470
how to use social media
in their businesses,

65
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,020
and specifically, I've
been asked to speak about

66
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,420
how brands and businesses
can work with influencers.

67
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,960
- [Kendra] We're playing
Bingo in what language, Lisey?

68
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,320
- Spanish.

69
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,518
- [Kendra] Ooh, Spanish!

70
00:02:42,518 --> 00:02:43,351
- Espanol.

71
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,310
- [Kendra] Who won the last round?

72
00:02:45,398 --> 00:02:46,471
- Caleb.

73
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:50,138
(speaking foreign language)

74
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:54,070
- [Kendra] Round two, doo do-doo do-doo!

75
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,513
(speaking foreign language)

76
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,346
- [Child] I got it!

77
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,860
- [Kendra] What does el ojo mean?

78
00:03:01,065 --> 00:03:02,139
- [Both] Eye.

79
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:03,960
(speaking foreign language)

80
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,260
- [Kendra] Let's see what comes up next.

81
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,920
(speaking foreign language)

82
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,958
Laura, where is

83
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:09,791
(speaking foreign language)?

84
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:11,293
Good job, you got it!

85
00:03:11,293 --> 00:03:12,964
(speaking foreign language)

86
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:17,280
So Lisey is helping out
and making lunch today!

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,890
- I really like it.

88
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:20,500
- [Kendra] What are you making?

89
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,230
- Turkey sandwiches with Cheez-Its,

90
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,050
broccoli with ranch, and grapes.

91
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,250
- [Kendra] Nice, it's a great lunch!

92
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,730
- Thank you, I'm making mine right now.

93
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,731
- [Kendra] Well, thank
you, this is a big help.

94
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,398
(playful music)

95
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,003
- So Kendra's calling.

96
00:03:42,003 --> 00:03:43,590
We're going to sing
Happy Birthday to Janea.

97
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,670
I'm so sad I'm missing her birthday today.

98
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,770
I'm sure Kendra has said this,

99
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,996
but we're gonna celebrate
it when I get back.

100
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,620
Hey!

101
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,520
Happy birthday!

102
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,070
I miss you!

103
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,802
Hey, I miss you too.

104
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:01,432
(kissing)

105
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:03,080
- Mwah!

106
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,353
- [Jeremy] Hey, buddy!

107
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:08,600
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

108
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,760
I can't believe you're one years old!

109
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,580
- Well, today's actually going really well

110
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,080
with school and the house and the kids.

111
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,970
I just haven't managed

112
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,910
to get out of my pajamas yet today.

113
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,370
This girl's ready for another nap,

114
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,380
and look, this is a new
outfit I just got her.

115
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,770
Here, show 'em what it says!

116
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,050
It says happy little one.

117
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,260
I love it!

118
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,830
Look at those tired eyes.

119
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,840
Oh, Janea, you're tired.

120
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,570
Let's go take a nap, okay?

121
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,460
She's like, "But walking
is so much more fun!"

122
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:38,080
Look at her walking around!

123
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,690
- On bellies, miss blankets,
and slings snugly tight.

124
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,370
- So in math today, Elise is
learning a whole new concept,

125
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,860
which is subtraction with renaming

126
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,130
or subtraction with borrowing,

127
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,140
whatever you like to call it,

128
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,080
and I've been a little bit
nervous to tackle this,

129
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,900
because it's a complex topic.

130
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,910
I remember being confused
by it when I was a kid,

131
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,210
but I love the way her
curriculum is presenting it,

132
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,480
and it's very hands-on.

133
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,320
There's a whole story that goes with it.

134
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,490
I'm enjoying it, what are you thinking?

135
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,480
- I like it.

136
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,810
- [Kendra] Is it confusing?

137
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,130
- A little bit.

138
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,963
- [Kendra] A little?

139
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,150
You're gonna get better and better at it.

140
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,610
So we've got 22 minus 13.

141
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,647
What do we start with?

142
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,140
(learning music)

143
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,840
- Hello, do you have any fours?

144
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,673
No?

145
00:05:20,673 --> 00:05:24,010
But I really, really need a four!

146
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,240
Stay right here.

147
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,600
That one, that one.

148
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,010
- [Kendra] Write it over on the side.

149
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,770
Draw what you did.

150
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,603
- Six.

151
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,800
- [Kendra] Where did the 10 go?

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,320
What's 13 minus four?

153
00:05:37,968 --> 00:05:39,607
- Nine.

154
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,440
And three.

155
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,730
39.

156
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:44,920
- [Kendra] Good job, you got it!

157
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,520
That's her lipstick?

158
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,353
- [Laura] Mm-hmm.

159
00:05:47,353 --> 00:05:49,360
- [Kendra] That is some
good-looking lipstick.

160
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,630
Laura, I love how you wrote your name

161
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:52,470
in all different colors.

162
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,192
- Mm-hmm, this is you, Mommy,
the one that I just did

163
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:59,700
with the big mouth and lipstick.

164
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,337
- Oh, thanks!
- This is Daddy.

165
00:06:01,337 --> 00:06:02,950
Smile.

166
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,830
- [Kendra] It's so nice that you drew

167
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,460
a picture of Mommy and Daddy.

168
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,293
- And me!

169
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,100
- [Kendra] I'm glad you're with us.

170
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,400
We like it when you're with us.

171
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,460
- I'm going on a date, but we're inside.

172
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,400
- [Kendra] This is Laura and
Mom and Dad on Halloween.

173
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,726
Oh, that little one's Janea?

174
00:06:20,726 --> 00:06:23,300
(soft music)

175
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,520
So I invited some friends over

176
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,680
for a play date this afternoon,

177
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,390
something to keep us busy and distract us

178
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:28,880
with Jeremy being out of town,

179
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,310
and I'm feeling a little
bit worried about that

180
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,870
at the moment, because I
still haven't had a chance

181
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,000
to get out of my pajamas today,

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
and my house is a little bit trashed,

183
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,360
but we still have an
hour, so there's time,

184
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,410
and they're good friends.

185
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,090
Like, I know they'll love us regardless,

186
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,310
but I really would like to try

187
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,760
to get this place cleaned up.

188
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,070
Caleb, what are you guys doing?

189
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,800
- We're just organizing
this drawer here (mumbles).

190
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,050
- [Kendra] Deep cleaning
one of the disgusting

191
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,450
bathroom drawers, it was bad.

192
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,970
- [Caleb] Yeah, it is bad.

193
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,530
- [Kendra] But it's gonna get better.

194
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,420
Good plan organizing it, team.

195
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,020
This looks so much better.

196
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,540
It didn't take that long
to clean it, did it?

197
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,800
Good job, boys.

198
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,630
(sanding)

199
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,690
Whatcha doing?

200
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:07,110
- Sanding!

201
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,250
Feel it.

202
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,060
- [Kendra] That looks so soft.

203
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,240
Oh my goodness.

204
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,860
You're an amazing sander.

205
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:13,693
- Thanks.

206
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:14,526
- [Kendra] Caleb's really excited.

207
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:17,500
He got some composite wood scraps today.

208
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,810
- It never goes bad.

209
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,643
- [Kendra] Never goes bad.

210
00:07:20,643 --> 00:07:22,030
It never rots, huh?

211
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,910
He wants to build something with it.

212
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,420
- So right now, we are
heading to gymnastics,

213
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,030
and I'm really excited.

214
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,260
I've been getting really
good at my back bends,

215
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,360
and the coach, when he puts
his arm out, it's lighter,

216
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,180
so I basically do it all by myself.

217
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,550
- [Kendra] Good job, Lisey!

218
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:42,150
- Today I'm so excited.

219
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,247
- [Kendra] Laura, where is Daddy?

220
00:07:43,247 --> 00:07:44,970
- At San Diego.

221
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,690
- [Kendra] Have you
ever been to San Diego?

222
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:47,606
- Yeah!

223
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:49,570
- Yeah?
- With my whole family I have.

224
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,270
- [Kendra] Yeah, did you
get to talk to Daddy today?

225
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,753
- Not that much, I miss him.

226
00:07:55,753 --> 00:07:58,700
(yelling)

227
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,690
- Well, I'm over here
watching gymnastics tonight,

228
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,850
and I swear Janea is running.

229
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,520
She is so excited!

230
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,910
I haven't been able to
capture it on camera,

231
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,330
'cause I'm too busy watching her,

232
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,560
but it's like she went from
walking to really walking.

233
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,352
Oh, did you find the stairs?

234
00:08:12,352 --> 00:08:15,185
(exploring music)

235
00:08:16,082 --> 00:08:17,490
(squeals)

236
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,014
Do you feel stuck?

237
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:20,006
(babbles)

238
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,395
Yeah?

239
00:08:21,395 --> 00:08:22,470
(squeals)

240
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,670
Happy birthday.

241
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,136
She's, like, all nervous or something.

242
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:28,969
(exploring music)

243
00:08:37,078 --> 00:08:39,159
Look at her go, oh my goodness!

244
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,129
Well, Janea is going
crazy here at gymnastics,

245
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,630
running around and crawling
around and climbing around

246
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,940
and trying to get into everything,

247
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,040
and she found the bin of shoes,

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,150
and she was so excited!

249
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,040
I can't keep her out of everything, so.

250
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,060
Anyway, I'm grateful that
usually Jeremy's home

251
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,560
to help me with the, you
know, running around things,

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,200
and so she doesn't usually have to come.

253
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,550
Well, my kids are all in
bed, and I am so tired,

254
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,300
but it was a really good day.

255
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,260
I was really grateful,

256
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,720
because Isaac usually has violin lessons

257
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,310
at the very end of the evening,

258
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,890
and they got canceled today,

259
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:10,250
and so I just was glad to not have to

260
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,620
run anywhere else and to focus

261
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,920
on getting the kids to bed.

262
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,470
As I was tucking Laura into bed,

263
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,440
Isaac came and delivered me this note,

264
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,860
and it just warmed my heart.

265
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,200
Check this out.

266
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,850
It's a note from Elise and from Isaac

267
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,380
saying thank you.

268
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,430
I am now going to do super fun things

269
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,940
like clean the kitchen and go to bed.

270
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,110
Good night, J House out.

271
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,690
The sun is out, and it feels so good!

272
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,273
(upbeat music)

273
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,140
- First time on the chair lift.

274
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,471
- [Kendra] You ready to go home?

275
00:09:45,471 --> 00:00:00,000
- Yep.
