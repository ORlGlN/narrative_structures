1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,268
(Kendra makes silly sounds and laughs)

2
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:04,937
(Laura squeals and laughs)

3
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:07,275
- [Kendra] Poor girl,
she's the fourth child,

4
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:08,840
the neglected fourth child.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,072
Uhhh! Spit-up!

6
00:00:10,072 --> 00:00:12,613
(collective noises of disgust)

7
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:16,446
(cheerful introductory music)

8
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:21,665
(bell chimes for each name)

9
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:39,759
(loud vacuuming)

10
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:41,131
- [Kendra] Hi, Mister Caleb!

11
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,409
- Hi.

12
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:45,640
- Look at this. He picked
up every single toy

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,252
and put it away. Then
he got out the vacuum

14
00:00:48,252 --> 00:00:50,309
from the closet, plugged it in,

15
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,309
and started vacuuming.
My two-year-old did that.

16
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,532
While sometimes I think he's a terror,

17
00:00:58,532 --> 00:01:00,844
a lovable terror of destruction,

18
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:04,361
and wow, busyness,
really, I think he's just

19
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:08,029
insanely independent
and focused and driven,

20
00:01:09,372 --> 00:01:11,151
and those are going to be great attributes

21
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,066
that serve him well in this life!

22
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:16,790
As long as he makes it to adulthood.

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,716
(loud vacuuming)

24
00:01:19,716 --> 00:01:23,883
So, Little Miss just woke
up. Can you say good morning?

25
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,711
She just took her nap. I
finally got my makeup on.

26
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:34,044
Lovely. Caleb, what did you make for us?

27
00:01:37,093 --> 00:01:38,812
(Caleb starts to cry)

28
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:41,712
Oh, Buddy, I'm so sorry! Come here!

29
00:01:41,712 --> 00:01:44,066
Let Mama help you up.

30
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:45,273
You alright, tough guy?

31
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,403
- Yeah.

32
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:47,682
- [Elise] Tough little guy!

33
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:50,914
- [Kendra] Yeah? Here, climb
back up! Climb back up.

34
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,289
That exact incident happens

35
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:54,531
about seven thousand times each day,

36
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,780
doesn't it, Caleb?

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,613
- Yeah.

38
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,896
- [Kendra] All right,
show me what you made.

39
00:01:58,896 --> 00:01:59,792
- [Elise] And look at the back!

40
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:00,625
- [Caleb] Airplane!

41
00:02:00,625 --> 00:02:01,458
- [Kendra] It's an airplane?

42
00:02:01,458 --> 00:02:02,431
- [Elise] Look at the back.

43
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:04,369
- [Kendra] Ooh!

44
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:06,927
(loud music)

45
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:07,760
- Wow!

46
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:12,250
- [Jeremy] What are you doin'?

47
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,417
- Whee! I made it into fun soap. (shrieks)

48
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:24,027
I have (laughs loudly) a hat!

49
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,628
(Jeremy laughs)

50
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,237
- [Jeremy] Silly goose!

51
00:02:27,237 --> 00:02:29,197
(delighted squeals and giggles)

52
00:02:29,197 --> 00:02:30,890
- [Elise] I'm over too far!

53
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,588
- [Jeremy] That's enough soap, okay?

54
00:02:32,588 --> 00:02:34,028
- I put some on you!

55
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,861
(Elise yells)

56
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,150
- [Jeremy] No, don't get it on me!

57
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,234
- [Isaac] Now we have to "grr".

58
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:38,542
- [Caleb] I put some on me.

59
00:02:38,542 --> 00:02:40,817
(children roar in unison)

60
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,050
- [Caleb] Whoa!

61
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,064
- [Isaac] Forehead,
forehead, forehead, forehead.

62
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:48,150
(Caleb laughs)

63
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,900
(children laugh)

64
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:56,257
- Guys! I'm covered with tons of bubbles!

65
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:58,025
- [Jeremy] So we have this light.

66
00:02:58,025 --> 00:02:59,366
- [Kendra] It's awesome!

67
00:02:59,366 --> 00:03:01,632
It's my favorite light in the house.

68
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:02,465
[Jeremy] You're pushing it,

69
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,003
but if you don't hold it just right,

70
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:07,711
(laughs) it worked! It was flashing

71
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:08,911
on and off, and on and off.

72
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:10,195
- [Kendra] It did it twenty times

73
00:03:10,195 --> 00:03:12,291
before pulling out the camera.

74
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,379
- [Jeremy] Hey, that's a good thing.

75
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,587
If turning on the camera means
that the light will work,

76
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:19,515
I'm totally fine with
that. How was your evening?

77
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,922
- I hate shopping. Shopping
is the bane of my existence,

78
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:27,005
and I have decided I'm
never going to shop again.

79
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:29,941
(chuckles)

80
00:03:29,941 --> 00:03:33,943
- We're gonna start a
garden, and hunt a lot.

81
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:36,738
- It's such a waste of time.
You drive to the store,

82
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:40,488
you get out of the car,
you get in the store,

83
00:03:41,483 --> 00:03:43,734
(laughs) you look at stuff,

84
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:46,219
you look at stuff you
didn't know you needed.

85
00:03:46,219 --> 00:03:47,351
And then you pick it all up,

86
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,512
and then you go to the cash register,

87
00:03:48,512 --> 00:03:49,978
and you decide, "Just kidding,

88
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:51,755
I didn't really need all of that!"

89
00:03:51,755 --> 00:03:53,693
And then you put it back.

90
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,202
- This is what most people's
shopping experience is like,

91
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:58,134
right? Okay, good, keep going.

92
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:00,590
- There's not a piece of
the process that I enjoy.

93
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,624
I don't enjoy going, I
don't enjoy looking at it,

94
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:03,920
I don't enjoy deciding on it,

95
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,353
I don't enjoy paying for it,

96
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:06,445
and I don't enjoy taking it home

97
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,649
and either having to organize
it or do something with it.

98
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,634
I just hate shopping.

99
00:04:10,634 --> 00:04:13,231
I do not want to purchase anything else

100
00:04:13,231 --> 00:04:15,963
for the rest of my life.

101
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:19,637
- [Jeremy] All right. I'm
glad you had a good day.

102
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:20,672
(Kendra laughs)

103
00:04:20,672 --> 00:04:23,422
- My favorite part of my day was:

104
00:04:24,924 --> 00:04:27,321
So I was putting up
the storm drain outside

105
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:30,007
that we had taken down
when we were painting,

106
00:04:30,007 --> 00:04:32,301
- [Kendra] You don't have to
selfie it. I'm right here.

107
00:04:32,301 --> 00:04:33,134
- Huh?

108
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,332
- You don't have to
selfie it. I'm right here.

109
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:35,415
- Oh, you can hold it?

110
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:36,248
- Yeah.

111
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:37,667
- Well, you're lower than
me, so I double chin.

112
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,733
- Yeah, you might want to sit down

113
00:04:38,733 --> 00:04:43,010
so you don't have a double chin. (laughs)

114
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,537
- There's a reason people hold it up,

115
00:04:44,537 --> 00:04:45,370
because.

116
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,962
- It makes 'em look not.

117
00:04:46,962 --> 00:04:51,129
- Yeah. Okay, so I was putting
back up the storm drain,

118
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,523
and it's a pretty basic process,

119
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:57,606
but I don't do a lot of manual labor.

120
00:04:58,763 --> 00:05:01,197
- Side note: it was dark out. (giggles)

121
00:05:01,197 --> 00:05:03,020
- By the time I was finishing up,

122
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,134
it was completely dark outside.

123
00:05:05,134 --> 00:05:06,886
And I don't have all the proper tools,

124
00:05:06,886 --> 00:05:08,659
which makes every kind of project harder.

125
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:11,509
- Side note: he has a
hammer and a screwdriver.

126
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,882
(laughter)

127
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:17,730
- You end something like
that, and it's done.

128
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,087
You can look at it, and it's finished,

129
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:22,425
and the type of work I do,
I'll be working on something

130
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:25,042
for over a year before there's completion.

131
00:05:25,042 --> 00:05:27,730
And even then, people still
aren't happy about it.

132
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,147
And I put up a storm drain and it's done,

133
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:34,302
and it looks good, and it's finished,

134
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:36,915
and it was rewarding. It was super fun.

135
00:05:36,915 --> 00:00:00,000
(gradual cymbal cues cheerful end music)
