00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,067
- So grandmother is feeling better.

5
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:43,061
She's out of the hospital
and she's here at our house.

6
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:46,748
And the kids were gonna
come in and sing to her.

15
00:01:09,288 --> 00:01:10,121

16
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:10,954

18
00:01:11,787 --> 00:01:15,749
♫ If you're happy and you

26
00:01:36,837 --> 00:01:38,039
We love you.

27
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,631
We love you grandmother.

28
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:41,303

♫ The same old dream I dreamed

49
00:03:11,656 --> 00:03:13,137
♫ I knew when we collided

50
00:03:13,137 --> 00:03:15,240
♫ You're the one I have decided

One arm.

58
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,388
Now this time, we're

I want you to lock your elbows.

147
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,906
I'm riding a horse.

148
00:07:26,906 --> 00:00:00,000
It's so fun, it's been a
while since I've done this.
