1
00:00:00,366 --> 00:00:02,445
- So today is Jeremy and I's anniversary,

2
00:00:02,445 --> 00:00:05,053
and we are out together celebrating.

3
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:07,740
I am going to go have an
eye doctor appointment.

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,769
The kids are helping.
(lively music)

5
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:10,444
Let's see what kinds
I'm gonna be looking at.

6
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,332
- We know how to live
it up anniversary style.

7
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:14,245
- Oh yeah, eye doctor, board game.

8
00:00:14,245 --> 00:00:17,128
- [Jeremy] Kendra's trying contacts.

9
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:19,045
- And then you grab it.

10
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:26,564
(playful music)

11
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:31,185
(Janae cooing)

12
00:00:31,185 --> 00:00:32,708
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,100
Whatcha doing buddy?

14
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,017
- Um, play.

15
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,663
(classical music)

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,357
- [Jeremy] Is that for me?

17
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:48,581
(dramatic music)

18
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:52,345
- I'm strong.

19
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,330
- [Jeremy] Strong enough to do the dishes.

20
00:01:03,718 --> 00:01:06,846
You puttin' on some make-up?
(classical music)

21
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:07,679
- Uh-huh.

22
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,973
- [Jeremy] Can you go (smacking).

23
00:01:11,973 --> 00:01:14,056
(smacks)

24
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,024
How did it turn out?

25
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:28,696
Thanks for doing the trash you guys?

26
00:01:28,696 --> 00:01:29,529
- Yeah.

27
00:01:29,529 --> 00:01:30,415
- It's stinky.

28
00:01:30,415 --> 00:01:34,415
- [Jeremy] Yeah, that's
what happens with trash.

29
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:36,987
- It's so funny, like I just keep thinking

30
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:38,054
about that this morning,

31
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:39,815
because Jeremy and I are getting
a bunch done this morning.

32
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:41,959
And it's because we're motivated.

33
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:44,831
We have a deadline that
we're working towards

34
00:01:44,831 --> 00:01:45,664
and we gotta get it done,

35
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:47,229
so we're just doing it
and it's just amazing,

36
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,941
like, how to get stuff done.

37
00:01:48,941 --> 00:01:50,030
Do it.

38
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,447
The kids are helping undecorate the tree.

39
00:01:54,463 --> 00:01:56,029
So yo have to follow the right lines.

40
00:01:56,029 --> 00:01:57,171
If you're pulling on the wrong part,

41
00:01:57,171 --> 00:01:59,088
then it won't come off.

42
00:02:00,179 --> 00:02:03,666
So you just kind of unhook
it from the branches.

43
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:04,727
Good job.

44
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,159
Now Caleb and Laura are helping.

45
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,311
What are you guys up to?

46
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:09,041
- We're getting all these.

47
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:13,937
- [Kendra] Yep, all the little
branches that fell down.

48
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:15,236
- It's time.

49
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:16,552
- [Kendra] It is.

50
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,833
- But after Christmas,
my birthday is coming,

51
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,166
so Christmas has to go away,

52
00:02:23,366 --> 00:02:24,199
right Mom?

53
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,477
- [Kendra] Yep, Christmas
has to going away

54
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:27,085
so we can get to Laura's birthday.

55
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:29,661
How old are you gonna be?

56
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:30,959
Four.

57
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,274
So today is Jeremy and I's anniversary

58
00:02:33,274 --> 00:02:35,681
and we are out together celebrating.

59
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:38,489
- I can't believe it's been 13 years.

60
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,729
- 13.

61
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,677
That makes me feel old and maybe wise,

62
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,389
like maybe we've gathered some wisdom

63
00:02:43,389 --> 00:02:44,861
in these years?

64
00:02:44,861 --> 00:02:47,319
Anyway, we're starting by eating.

65
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:49,197
(funky bright music)

66
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:53,188
So I ordered a pesto chicken quinoa bowl.

67
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:54,275
- [Jeremy] She went healthy.

68
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,306
- I wanted to.

69
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:58,806
- [Jeremy] I went with biscuits and gravy.

70
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:01,764
- Well we're a pretty normal couple.

71
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,283
We just like to do kind of classic things

72
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:05,532
for our anniversary.

73
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,365
- Yeah.

74
00:03:06,365 --> 00:03:07,327
- So we went out to eat

75
00:03:07,327 --> 00:03:09,126
and now we're going to Target.

76
00:03:09,126 --> 00:03:09,959
It gets better than that,

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,560
we are not just going to Target.

78
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,393
- [Jeremy] No.

79
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,531
- I am going to have an
eye doctor appointment,

80
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,772
I'm hoping.

81
00:03:15,772 --> 00:03:18,158
- I was hoping for the
anniversary special,

82
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,386
you know 'cause so many people come

83
00:03:20,386 --> 00:03:21,777
on their anniversary for eye appointments.

84
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:23,664
- Yeah, that's the thing to do.

85
00:03:23,664 --> 00:03:25,118
Anyway, my eyes have
been really bothering me

86
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:27,451
and I just haven't had time.

87
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:29,753
- So we were able to get an appointment

88
00:03:29,753 --> 00:03:30,897
in 20 minutes.

89
00:03:30,897 --> 00:03:32,735
So we're just looking
at glasses now to see--

90
00:03:32,735 --> 00:03:35,235
- Let's see what kinds
I'm gonna be looking at.

91
00:03:35,235 --> 00:03:36,068
- Yeah.

92
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,651
(mellow music)

93
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,669
So poll question.

94
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:45,725
Do you wear contacts or glasses?

95
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,309
Let us know in the poll.

96
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:49,226
- Check out this shape.

97
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:51,859
What do you think?

98
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:53,318
- [Jeremy] Neato.

99
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,219
- Neato?

100
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,218
(Jeremy laughs)

101
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:56,522
He's not feeling it.

102
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:57,410
- No they're fine.

103
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,658
That's the funny thing about styles,

104
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,034
because they completely change.

105
00:04:00,034 --> 00:04:02,166
Where one thing that
was like a grandma style

106
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:05,454
is now apparently cute,
and I don't keep up

107
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,121
with all the styles.

108
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,872
- What do you think?

109
00:04:10,872 --> 00:04:12,353
- [Jeremy] You just look good
no matter what you have on.

110
00:04:12,353 --> 00:04:14,770
(bell dings)

111
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:20,926
- So I think I kind of like the cat eyes.

112
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,593
What do you think of these ones?

113
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:25,581
- Kinda different.
- They look good.

114
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,821
- Kinda different.

115
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,823
- [Jeremy] So we're
looking at different games.

116
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,735
This one's like an air hockey board game.

117
00:04:31,735 --> 00:04:32,568
That sounds fun.

118
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,534
But the one game that I would dominate,

119
00:04:34,534 --> 00:04:37,234
and would love is this right here.

120
00:04:37,234 --> 00:04:38,067
- [Kendra] That's embarrassing.

121
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:38,900
- [Jeremy] The Saved by the Bell game.

122
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,235
I would know every answer.

123
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:41,068
- Check it out,

124
00:04:41,068 --> 00:04:42,304
there's also the Bob Ross game.

125
00:04:42,304 --> 00:04:43,527
- [Jeremy] And a Super
Mario Brothers game.

126
00:04:43,527 --> 00:04:45,711
And an Oregon Trail game.

127
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:47,107
- Scattergories, you can't go wrong.

128
00:04:47,107 --> 00:04:49,368
- We know how to live
it up anniversary style.

129
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,785
- Oh yeah, eye doctor, board game.

130
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:52,697
(Jeremy laughs)

131
00:04:52,697 --> 00:04:55,630
And we're also considering
a different ring.

132
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,819
What would that be like?

133
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,534
- [Jeremy] So we decided
on Exploding kittens.

134
00:04:59,534 --> 00:05:00,836
- [Kendra] And show them the other one.

135
00:05:00,836 --> 00:05:02,245
Pucket.

136
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:05,236
He's gonna win, but I'm gonna try.

137
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:06,756
So I don't know much
about exploding kittens,

138
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:09,093
but I know I've heard about
it a lot of different places,

139
00:05:09,093 --> 00:05:10,888
so we're gonna give it a try.

140
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:12,070
(bright music)

141
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,472
- [Jeremy] I can see it.

142
00:05:13,472 --> 00:05:14,871
- [Man] That's your eye.

143
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:16,585
- [Jeremy] Whoa, that's your eye.

144
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:19,168
- [Man] So open both real wide.

145
00:05:21,825 --> 00:05:22,658
- Woop!

146
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:25,116
(laughs)

147
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,126
- [Jeremy] Happy anniversary hon.

148
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,198
Happy anniversary.

149
00:05:28,198 --> 00:05:31,382
(Jeremy laughs)

150
00:05:31,382 --> 00:05:33,406
Kendra's trying contacts.

151
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:34,985
- [Man] Look down.

152
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:36,370
- [Jeremy] For the first time.

153
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,523
- [Man] Awesome.

154
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,849
- [Jeremy] Nailed it.

155
00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:41,319
- Is it in my eye?

156
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,152
- [Man] Yep.

157
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:42,985
- [Jeremy] Cured.

158
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:43,818
Kendra's trying to figure out

159
00:05:43,818 --> 00:05:46,298
how to put in the contacts by herself.

160
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,139
- [Man] Just try to get as
close to the eyelid as you can,

161
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,586
because the more room
you have to work with,

162
00:05:49,586 --> 00:05:50,745
the easier it's gonna be.

163
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:51,578
And so what you're gonna do,

164
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:52,971
is you're gonna use your index finger

165
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:54,971
and your thumb on the bottom hand,

166
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:56,458
and just reach in and just pluck it out,

167
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:58,686
like you're trying to pick
something up off the ground.

168
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:00,569
So you're already really
close right there.

169
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,885
So you just have to apply a little bit

170
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,302
more pressure than you think.

171
00:06:05,975 --> 00:06:07,425
- Awesome.
- Got it.

172
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:08,793
- [Man] That was great, yeah.

173
00:06:08,793 --> 00:06:10,528
And then you just place it right in there.

174
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,383
And so that's what you're
gonna do every single night.

175
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:13,718
- Where did it go?

176
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:15,338
- [Man] It's still in your eye, yeah.

177
00:06:15,338 --> 00:06:16,171
- Okay.

178
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:18,636
- Awesome.
- Nice.

179
00:06:18,636 --> 00:06:19,469
- Got it.
- Man, nice.

180
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:20,492
- [Jeremy] Kendra's a gifted student.

181
00:06:20,492 --> 00:06:21,325
- I feel like I'm going fishing.

182
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,212
- Yeah exactly.

183
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:26,103
Alright and then put it
right near your pupil.

184
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:26,936
- Ah!

185
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:27,769
- [Man] You almost had it there.

186
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,700
Real quick I would pull
your finger back out.

187
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,667
You might want to dry
off your index finger.

188
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,741
It's gonna cling to whatever is the--

189
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:34,574
- Most wet.

190
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,629
- [Man] Most wet, exactly.

191
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:37,549
- Ah!

192
00:06:37,549 --> 00:06:40,929
- [Jeremy] Try to keep
looking straight Kendra.

193
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,375
- [Man] And blink blink blink.

194
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,208
Awesome yeah.

195
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,041
- Is it in there?

196
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:46,995
- [Man] Yeah, you got it right in there.

197
00:06:46,995 --> 00:06:48,181
Hey high five.

198
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,175
You're doing it crazy fast.

199
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:51,431
- [Jeremy] We have a movie
we're trying to get to.

200
00:06:51,431 --> 00:06:52,724
- [Man] Yeah true.

201
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,549
- So the next really
romantic thing we're doing

202
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:57,544
is coming home to nurse Janae.

203
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,424
Here's what the kids are doing obviously.

204
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,257
- Ready.

205
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:02,829
- Green light.

206
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:03,662
Red light.

207
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,931
You guys all have to go back.

208
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:08,459
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you can't keep riding.

209
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,292
You gotta stop.

210
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,290
Do you know how to stop you guys.

211
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,123
- I don't.

212
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:14,323
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you just
lift your foot forward.

213
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:15,156
- Just one foot.

214
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:16,323
- Green light.

215
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:18,451
Red light.

216
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,178
(Jeremy laughs)

217
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:23,098
- Now we're headed to a movie,

218
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,857
which is a much more normal

219
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:26,826
anniversary thing to do.

220
00:07:26,826 --> 00:07:29,961
So we're gonna see The Greatest Showman.

221
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:31,025
Sounds good.

222
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:33,585
- I think it's a musical.

223
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:34,510
- [Kendra] Thank you.

224
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,022
- [Jeremy] Let's do it.

225
00:07:36,022 --> 00:07:37,397
- We made it on time

226
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:39,216
and we found seats together.

227
00:07:39,216 --> 00:07:41,302
(rousing music)

228
00:07:41,302 --> 00:07:42,965
(stopwatch ticking)

229
00:07:42,965 --> 00:07:45,168
So I just told the kids
that I got contacts today.

230
00:07:45,168 --> 00:07:46,465
Can you guys see 'em?

231
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:47,298
- No.

232
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,131
- No.
(enchanting music)

233
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,572
- It's like little tiny
circles around my eyes.

234
00:07:50,572 --> 00:07:52,012
- Can I see Mom?

235
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:54,528
- Now you can swim--
_ kind of.

236
00:07:54,528 --> 00:07:57,195
- Now you can swim with your eyes open.

237
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:59,620
- Wow, are you sure, or
will the contacts fall out?

238
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,232
- When you you have to take them out,

239
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,055
do you have to like touch your eyeball?

240
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:04,415
- I do.

241
00:08:04,415 --> 00:08:05,399
It's kinda weird.

242
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:07,693
- [Jeremy] She's getting
pretty good at it though.

243
00:08:07,693 --> 00:08:10,180
- So what you do is you open your eye

244
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,964
really big like that,

245
00:08:11,964 --> 00:08:13,714
and then you grab it.

246
00:08:15,044 --> 00:08:16,627
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae!

247
00:08:18,032 --> 00:08:19,199
We missed you.

248
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:21,186
- So I'm supposed to wear 'em for a week

249
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:24,387
and then I decide if I
want glasses or contacts.

250
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,476
- Daddy is it your second anniversary

251
00:08:26,476 --> 00:08:28,116
or your third anniversary

252
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,708
or your fourth anniversary?

253
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:33,605
- [Jeremy] It's our
thirteenth anniversary.

254
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:34,938
- I was way off.
- Can you believe that?

255
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:37,883
- We've been married for 13 years.

256
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,259
- Wow, I was way off.

257
00:08:39,259 --> 00:08:41,875
Goodnight, J House out.

258
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,892
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae, what's
your New Year's resolution?

259
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:45,500
(Janae vocalizing)

260
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,113
- I think she wants to learn

261
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:48,442
to speak more words.

262
00:08:48,442 --> 00:08:49,558
- [Jeremy] Maybe walk?

263
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:51,116
Can we go for potty trained
or is that too early?

264
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,449
- No we're not gonna
go for potty training.

265
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,282
- Okay.

266
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:55,174
So my New Year's resolution

267
00:08:55,174 --> 00:08:57,924
is to limit fear's power over me.

268
00:08:58,974 --> 00:09:00,856
When I see opportunities
or when I feel like

269
00:09:00,856 --> 00:00:00,000
I should do something, I don't want fear--
