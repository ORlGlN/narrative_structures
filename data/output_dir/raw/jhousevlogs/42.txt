1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,570
- What do you think the moon feels like?

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:02,858
Ready to head the the ocean, Zac?

3
00:00:02,858 --> 00:00:05,775
(electronic music)

4
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,501
- [Children] You can do it, Nay-nay.

5
00:00:12,501 --> 00:00:14,739
- So what do you think,
was that our first step?

6
00:00:14,739 --> 00:00:17,656
(electronic music)

7
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:20,720
- Good morning.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,610
- [Kendra] What time is it?

9
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,443
- Breakfast.

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,780
- [Kendra] This morning we're having

11
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,731
yogurt and granola with some apples.

12
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,990
It's a new kind of granola

13
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,784
we haven't tried before: maple pecan.

14
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:32,040
It's delicious.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,330
I taste tested it.

16
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,892
- I'm sore from riding the bike.

17
00:00:34,892 --> 00:00:36,710
- [Kendra] From riding yesterday?

18
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:40,131
We rode far, that was
six and a half miles.

19
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,381
- I'm sore too.

20
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,207
- [Kendra] So what did you think
of the bike ride yesterday?

21
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:45,310
- My butt did not hurt at all

22
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:47,535
but I really wanted to go on the bike.

23
00:00:47,535 --> 00:00:49,868
- [Kendra] Yeah, you were
in the bike carrier, huh?

24
00:00:49,868 --> 00:00:51,038
- Mama.

25
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:52,577
- [Kendra] Mama.

26
00:00:52,577 --> 00:00:53,930
- [Jeremy] Who did your hair today?

27
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,763
- Me.

28
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:59,464
I put gel, made it kind of
crazy with the gel, the water,

29
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:03,288
and then I comb it to the
side and then bring it up.

30
00:01:03,288 --> 00:01:04,470
- I'm really proud of you,

31
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,510
I'm sure glad I don't have
to do you hair anymore.

32
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,343
Looks great.

33
00:01:07,343 --> 00:01:09,522
On another note, I'm having
kind of a bad beard day today.

34
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:13,314
It's a thing, sometimes the
beard just doesn't work.

35
00:01:13,314 --> 00:01:16,415
(energetic piano music)

36
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:17,880
- This is beautiful.

37
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,480
So for church today, we decided to

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,060
come worship at the oldest
church here in California

39
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,000
which is the mission in San Diego.

40
00:01:29,575 --> 00:01:32,742
(church bell ringing)

41
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,676
- Nay-Nay?

42
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:40,612
Hey.

43
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:45,066
(energetic piano music)

44
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,900
I really enjoyed mass.

45
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,770
It was fun to do that
with our whole family.

46
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,050
- Our family is not Catholic,

47
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,430
but I have good memories of
going to mass with my grandma.

48
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,064
Just a few times when I was a little girl.

49
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,180
Those memories and being
here at the mission,

50
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,997
which is the oldest
church here in San Diego,

51
00:02:03,997 --> 00:02:06,627
it's just a really special
morning to spend with our family.

52
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,179
I really want to raise my children

53
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:11,239
to respect and honor all religion.

54
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,171
♪ La la la la la ♪

55
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:17,054
♪ La la la la la ♪

56
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,804
♪ La la la la la ♪

57
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:30,070
- [Jeremy] Grillin'
some hot dogs for lunch.

58
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,500
So what are you guys watching?

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,850
- [Boys] Jared wrestling.

60
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,700
- [Jeremy] How cool.

61
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,388
That's my half-brother Jared.

62
00:02:38,388 --> 00:02:42,520
- He's giving me the same
move he did last time.

63
00:02:45,784 --> 00:02:47,299
That was so much fun.

64
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:50,900
- [Jeremy] We are sad we're
saying goodbye to Poppy Rod.

65
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,514
- Goodbye buddy, I love you

66
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:57,485
Good seein' ya.

67
00:02:57,485 --> 00:02:59,186
- Yeah, thanks for comin'.

68
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:00,103
- Bye, bye!

69
00:03:01,694 --> 00:03:04,860
- So, Genae is getting so close
to taking her first steps.

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,218
I keep getting nervous
that I'm gonna miss it.

71
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:08,110
Jeremy and I are going
to her practice walking

72
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,622
between us right now and see
if she'll take her first steps.

73
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:15,622
- [Children] You can do it, Nay-nay.

74
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:23,674
(laughing)

75
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,924
(cheering)

76
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,333
(cheering)

77
00:03:35,068 --> 00:03:37,770
- You got it, you ready?

78
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:39,560
Come to Mama.

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,471
- That was so close.
- Oh, that was close.

80
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,304
- Come to Mama?

81
00:03:43,304 --> 00:03:44,580
Come on.

82
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,580
- Oh, she's taking off.

83
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:50,761
(cheering)

84
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:56,940
So what do you think,
was that our first step?

85
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,360
We're gonna do a poll,
was that her first step?

86
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,260
- [Kendra] She loves this little spot.

87
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:05,770
(baby babbles)

88
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:06,603
- Hi.

89
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:09,010
- [Jeremy] You have to get
those little feet walking.

90
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,020
- Walk to Daddy.

91
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,466
Oh, so close.

92
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,700
I'm going to have to wait
and see the replay as well,

93
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,529
but I don't think that
was her first steps.

94
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,850
I think she got really, really close,

95
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,980
but I think we're still waiting.

96
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,811
- She does great holding my fingers.

97
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:29,909
- I remember when Laura
took her first step.

98
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,250
- [Kendra] I do too, that was fun, huh?

99
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,215
- Yeah.

100
00:04:33,215 --> 00:04:36,548
(laughing and cheering)

101
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,376
(light electronic music)

102
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,170
- So we came to a fun
part of San Diego today,

103
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,420
it's called Mission Beach,

104
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,439
and there's a thin long peninsula of land

105
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,450
that has the bay on one side of it

106
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:07,910
and the ocean on the other.

107
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,725
So we're at a bay park first
so we can experience that

108
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:11,850
and then we're gonna
walk over to the ocean

109
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,873
and kind of see the difference.

110
00:05:13,873 --> 00:05:17,290
(light electronic music)

111
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:31,860
- This sand right here is so soft

112
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,030
it feels like what I would kind

113
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,228
of imagine the moon
feeling like, it's nice.

114
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:39,710
- I never imagined what
the moon feels like.

115
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,960
Personally, if I've
ever pictured the moon,

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,675
it felt more rocky and
definitely less wet.

117
00:05:44,675 --> 00:05:46,680
This is a pretty wet sand.

118
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,739
What do you think the moon feels like?

119
00:05:49,739 --> 00:05:51,930
- It always looked like
kind of a baby powder.

120
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,727
- So it's interesting how the bay beach

121
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:57,863
and the ocean beach are so different.

122
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:59,354
- [Jeremy] One has waves and one doesn't?

123
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:01,127
- You guys want to walk
over and see the ocean?

124
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:02,255
- How will we do that?

125
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:03,826
- [Jeremy] It's right there.

126
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:04,830
- Over there?

127
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,663
- [Jeremy] Yup.

128
00:06:05,663 --> 00:06:06,840
- Ready to head to the ocean side?

129
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,257
(light electronic music)

130
00:06:21,243 --> 00:06:23,400
So from right here you can see the ocean.

131
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,420
It's hard to see, but you
can see it, and the bay.

132
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,098
- On our way to the ocean
there was another park

133
00:06:27,098 --> 00:06:28,708
that our kids wanted to go play at.

134
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:29,710
- Why not?

135
00:06:32,561 --> 00:06:36,785
- Riding on my horsie,
riding on my horsie.

136
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:40,202
(light electronic music)

137
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,100
- Because it's such a beautiful day,

138
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,633
it is really busy out here but that's

139
00:06:56,633 --> 00:06:58,920
kind of a fun part of the atmosphere.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,667
I'm sure it's way more
busy here in the summer,

141
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:04,103
but for January this has been
the busiest we've seen it.

142
00:07:04,103 --> 00:07:06,686
(reggae music)

143
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,520
So after spending some time at the beach,

144
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,898
we decided that I would
go back and get the car

145
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,649
and pick everybody up.

146
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:19,057
I got all the way to the car
before Kendra and I realized

147
00:07:19,057 --> 00:07:23,418
that she had the keys and I didn't.

148
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:27,070
So, we're dealing with that.

149
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,485
There they are.

150
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:30,240
Do you have the keys?

151
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,699
- No I don't.

152
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,972
- [Jeremy] I thought it'd be
better if we all go to the car.

153
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:36,462
- I agree.
- Yeah.

154
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:37,843
- Let's do that.
- Let's do that.

155
00:07:37,843 --> 00:07:40,843
(soft guitar music)

156
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,950
- I'm getting dinner
ready, we're keeping it

157
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,863
really simple tonight with
just some frozen lasagna.

158
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,236
I couldn't decide what type to get,

159
00:07:54,236 --> 00:07:56,450
and because our family is big enough

160
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,867
that we actually eat a lot of food,

161
00:07:57,867 --> 00:07:59,770
I got several different ones to try.

162
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,603
Let me show you.

163
00:08:00,603 --> 00:08:04,560
I got this one, this one, and this one.

164
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,760
You gotta cook 'em.
- What are these?

165
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,286
- [Kendra] It's lasagna.

166
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,574
- Can I look at 'em?

167
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:11,124
- Nope, they're still
frozen, we're gonna cook 'em.

168
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,610
So we're ending off the night
with a family movie night,

169
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,780
we're watching this movie.

170
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,740
It's an IMAX about the ocean.

171
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,303
We've got lasagna,
broccoli, and bread sticks.

172
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,170
- And hungry children.

173
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:32,861
- [Kendra] And a hungry daddy.

174
00:08:32,861 --> 00:08:34,316
- Thumbs up, thumbs down.

175
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:36,308
If you don't like it, that's fine.

176
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,975
And if you do, you can't eat it.

177
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,108
- Hey!
(soft acoustic country music)

178
