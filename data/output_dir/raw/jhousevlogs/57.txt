1
00:00:00,706 --> 00:00:02,289
- It's little tiny.

2
00:00:03,515 --> 00:00:06,598
(upbeat jazzy music)

3
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:22,329
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,224
- So we're driving into the fog

5
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:27,664
and fog is really fun for us here

6
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:29,545
because we live in Kansas City.

7
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:32,888
We don't have any fog in Kansas City.

8
00:00:32,888 --> 00:00:35,443
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:35,443 --> 00:00:38,345
We're stopping for some lunch
before we head to Legoland.

10
00:00:38,345 --> 00:00:40,845
(jazzy music)

11
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,057
- We're at Einstein Bagel.

12
00:00:44,057 --> 00:00:46,557
(jazzy music)

13
00:00:49,096 --> 00:00:52,013
- [Kendra] I love bagel sandwiches.

14
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:57,107
- [Jeremy] What's all
around your feet Laura?

15
00:00:57,107 --> 00:00:58,314
- Birds.

16
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:00,451
- [Jeremy] They're birds.

17
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,749
Nae-nae's loving the birds.

18
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:03,582
Hi birds.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,200
(jazzy music)

20
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,188
- [Caleb] That's made out of legos.

21
00:01:15,126 --> 00:01:17,709
(techno music)

22
00:01:26,457 --> 00:01:28,941
- Caleb, I think you're on the third one.

23
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,024
(cheers)

24
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,143
- Checking to see if
the kids are tall enough

25
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:36,726
to ride some of the rides here.

26
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:41,411
- This is gonna be
Janae's first ride ever.

27
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:43,965
- [Jeremy] She's clapping.

28
00:01:43,965 --> 00:01:47,378
- [Kendra] Oh she is, she's clapping.

29
00:01:47,378 --> 00:01:49,073
- Hi, hi everybody.

30
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:50,188
Hi.

31
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:53,271
(upbeat jazzy music)

32
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:07,928
- Do you see it, say hi.

33
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:08,761
Hi.

34
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:20,049
(cheers)

35
00:02:20,049 --> 00:02:23,044
- [Woman] Everyone make some noise.

36
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:26,377
(indiscernible singing)

37
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,888
(rock music)

38
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,768
- [Jeremy] Are you gonna drive?

39
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:39,089
Caleb, she's coming for you buddy.

40
00:02:39,089 --> 00:02:40,172
Go Laura, go!

41
00:02:41,132 --> 00:02:43,268
Steer, go the other way.

42
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:45,823
(rock music)

43
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,611
Good job Laura.

44
00:02:47,611 --> 00:02:48,861
Good job Cubby.

45
00:02:50,513 --> 00:02:52,763
Oh you jammed into someone.

46
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,824
Keep going, keep going
Laura, push the gas.

47
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,796
So Legoland is set up so half
of the park is for little kids

48
00:03:02,796 --> 00:03:04,422
and the other half is for bigger kids.

49
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:08,021
So we're starting on
the easier rides first.

50
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,716
- [Kendra] Do you guys wanna try driving?

51
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:10,668
- [Both] Yeah.

52
00:03:10,668 --> 00:03:12,619
- It's like stop and like real streets.

53
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:14,662
Like a whole city.

54
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,450
- [Kendra] A Lego city?

55
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:17,750
What happened to your voice?

56
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,250
- I kinda lost it.

57
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:21,837
- [Jeremy] Go get him.

58
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:24,228
Isaac, did you stop at the stop sign?

59
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,434
You're so obedient.

60
00:03:26,434 --> 00:03:28,851
(rock music)

61
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,349
- My driver's license.

62
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,464
- [Jeremy] Your driver's license.

63
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,903
You're kind of losing
your voice today huh?

64
00:03:38,903 --> 00:03:39,925
- Yeah.

65
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:40,947
- [Jeremy] Do you think you're

66
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:41,969
ready to drive a real car now?

67
00:03:41,969 --> 00:03:42,921
- Yeah.

68
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:43,942
- [Jeremy] Yeah, you can do it.

69
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:48,540
- But I think I might
need a little bit taller.

70
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,931
- [Kendra] Do you like driving the car?

71
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,255
What do you like about it?

72
00:03:52,255 --> 00:03:53,834
- That sometimes I bump.

73
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,459
- [Kendra] Oh do you bump into people?

74
00:03:55,459 --> 00:03:58,269
- I purposely bumped into people.

75
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:00,312
- [Kendra] This is not bumper cars.

76
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:02,541
Well the car driving is a big hit.

77
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,236
- I have two driver licenses.

78
00:04:04,236 --> 00:04:06,048
- [Kendra] Yes, Laura what did you do?

79
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,465
- I went two times and I won.

80
00:04:09,368 --> 00:04:10,390
- [Kendra] You won?

81
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,411
- Yeah.

82
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,619
- [Kendra] Good job.

83
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,359
(rock music)

84
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,776
Janae's cheering the kids on.

85
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,832
- [Jeremy] Hey!

86
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,878
(rock music)

87
00:04:30,777 --> 00:04:32,008
- [Kendra] How was it?

88
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:33,091
- I love you!

89
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,773
(upbeat music)

90
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:41,017
- [Jeremy] You're on the back
row Cub, how are you feeling?

91
00:04:41,017 --> 00:04:41,850
- Good.

92
00:04:43,153 --> 00:04:45,736
(upbeat music)

93
00:04:57,062 --> 00:04:59,036
- [Jeremy] Good job Laura!

94
00:04:59,036 --> 00:05:01,619
(upbeat music)

95
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:15,243
Poll question, when's the last
time you played with Legos?

96
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:17,797
Let us know in the poll.

97
00:05:17,797 --> 00:05:20,380
(upbeat music)

98
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:38,974
We're all lifting Janae up the stairs.

99
00:05:38,974 --> 00:05:40,557
She's directing us.

100
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,686
- So apparently the
apple fries is Legoland's

101
00:05:44,686 --> 00:05:46,915
iconic dessert so we pretty
much have to try it right?

102
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,099
- [Jeremy] We don't have a choice.

103
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:51,420
(upbeat music)

104
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,253
Big girl.

105
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,551
So while Kendra's waiting
in line for the apple fries,

106
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:59,106
we found this playground for the kids.

107
00:05:59,106 --> 00:06:01,689
(upbeat music)

108
00:06:06,536 --> 00:06:09,764
- [Kendra] Alright so these
are the granny apple fries.

109
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,264
What do you think?

110
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:13,618
- Yum.

111
00:06:13,618 --> 00:06:14,895
- [Kendra] We're gonna share it dude.

112
00:06:14,895 --> 00:06:17,194
So I got three of these
for our family to share.

113
00:06:17,194 --> 00:06:18,401
We might be back.

114
00:06:18,401 --> 00:06:21,211
- Okay, the apple fries are ready.

115
00:06:21,211 --> 00:06:23,858
Here we go, let's see what we think.

116
00:06:23,858 --> 00:06:24,880
- I'm gonna have it alone.

117
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,086
- [Jeremy] Without any cream first?

118
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:28,919
- It's like apple pie.

119
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,331
- It smells like apple pie.

120
00:06:33,843 --> 00:06:35,723
- [Woman] It tastes like apple pie.

121
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:37,640
- Yeah, those are good.

122
00:06:38,626 --> 00:06:41,126
- [Jeremy] Apple french fries.

123
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:45,267
- [Kendra] We're ruined,

124
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:47,101
now she knows where the good stuff is.

125
00:06:47,101 --> 00:06:49,957
Jeremy took the big kids to
ride a big roller coaster

126
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,583
and the little kids and
I are gonna party it up

127
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,115
over here on some of the little rides.

128
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:55,698
(cheery music)

129
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,543
(laughter)

130
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,493
Oh no!

131
00:07:04,121 --> 00:07:05,259
- Two times.

132
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,699
- [Kendra] You got to do it two times?

133
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:07,697
- So I got the bigger kids,

134
00:07:07,697 --> 00:07:09,508
we're gonna try their roller coaster here.

135
00:07:09,508 --> 00:07:12,063
(rock music)

136
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:15,824
We're about to do the
roller coaster Leesy!

137
00:07:15,824 --> 00:07:16,741
Here it is!

138
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,926
(screams)

139
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:27,369
Leesy!

140
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,598
Uh oh!

141
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:32,527
(screams)

142
00:07:32,527 --> 00:07:34,060
- I loved it.

143
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,707
- I wanna go on it again.

144
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:38,374
- [Jeremy] Going up?

145
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:44,485
Laura, how you feeling about this slide?

146
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,273
Get your feet all in.

147
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,690
Get your feet in.

148
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,123
Set go.

149
00:07:53,866 --> 00:07:55,116
Go ahead Laura.

150
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:59,795
(screams)

151
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,688
I didn't go very far.

152
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:05,639
- We have had a great
day at Legoland today

153
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:08,541
and we also had a really rough moment.

154
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,770
One of our kids threw quite a tantrum

155
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,487
and honestly I was super embarrassed.

156
00:08:13,487 --> 00:08:14,737
But it happens.

157
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:18,178
I tried to stay calm and we

158
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:21,591
disciplined the way that
we're trying to discipline

159
00:08:21,591 --> 00:08:22,758
in our family.

160
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,537
That child was able to overcome the issue.

161
00:08:26,537 --> 00:08:28,787
Anyway, just compassion for

162
00:08:31,181 --> 00:08:34,153
all the parents out there who
are dealing with tantrums.

163
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:35,592
Great kids have rough moments,

164
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,380
great parents have rough moments.

165
00:08:37,381 --> 00:08:39,424
Let's just all remember
to be really gentle

166
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:42,674
and understanding about
that with each other.

167
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:45,182
- That looks fun, you're
pulling yourself up.

168
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,599
- [Kendra] So do you think
you're gonna be strong enough?

169
00:08:46,599 --> 00:08:48,224
- Yeah.

170
00:08:48,224 --> 00:08:49,850
I'm over 40.

171
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,404
- [Kendra] You are over 40
inches so you get to ride.

172
00:08:52,404 --> 00:08:54,099
Who's gonna help you pull yourself up?

173
00:08:54,099 --> 00:08:54,932
Papa!

174
00:08:56,235 --> 00:08:58,464
Have we showed them your shirt?

175
00:08:58,464 --> 00:09:00,600
- [Caleb] I'm not retired,
I'm a professional Papa.

176
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,517
Me and him.

177
00:09:02,388 --> 00:09:04,638
(laughter)

178
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,042
- [Kendra] Whoa.

179
00:09:08,193 --> 00:09:09,981
They're going.

180
00:09:09,981 --> 00:09:12,791
(cheers)

181
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,183
- [Jeremy] Go, pull up, pull up.

182
00:09:15,183 --> 00:09:16,016
Pull up.

183
00:09:17,481 --> 00:09:18,481
They got it.

184
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:20,886
Okay, let go.

185
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,867
(rock music)

186
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,136
Princess.

187
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,944
You're Mary Poppins?

188
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,763
Let's do a picture.

189
00:09:37,706 --> 00:09:39,169
- She's getting tired.

190
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:41,752
(techno music)

191
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:44,881
- [Jeremy] Cubby, you ready?

192
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:45,996
- Yeah.

193
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:48,579
(techno music)

194
00:09:55,632 --> 00:09:57,513
- [Jeremy] Cubby.

195
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,904
Cubby got the highest score.

196
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,112
- But I got-

197
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,480
- [Jeremy] 110,000.

198
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,106
- So Caleb just came up to me and he said,

199
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:07,660
I wanna do something other than Legos.

200
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,285
- [Jeremy] We're at Legoland.

201
00:10:09,285 --> 00:10:11,584
You guys gonna build
the fastest Lego cars?

202
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:12,751
- [Both] Yeah.

203
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,205
- [Jeremy] Oh Elise.

204
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:17,482
Oh no!

205
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:18,315
I won!

206
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:21,568
What are we doing now?

207
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:22,700
- We're going on the dragon.

208
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,115
- It was like closed all this time.

209
00:10:25,115 --> 00:10:26,438
- [Jeremy] It was closed.

210
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:27,785
They said it might not open today.

211
00:10:27,785 --> 00:10:28,830
- But it opened.

212
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,080
I'm so excited.

213
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,782
(upbeat music)

214
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:40,796
(screams)

215
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:45,136
(upbeat music)

216
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:02,774
- [Kendra] She's dancing,
she's feeling the beat.

217
00:11:04,403 --> 00:11:06,098
Oh you wanna come to me.

218
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,979
Oh she almost let go.

219
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,233
First steps.

220
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:10,626
Just kidding, it wasn't her first steps,

221
00:11:10,626 --> 00:11:12,019
but she's thinking about it.

222
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,039
Oh yeah, she knows her moves.

223
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:15,061
- [Jeremy] She's dancing.

224
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,149
- [Kendra] She found her
place, she has her jam.

225
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,589
Hey.

226
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,377
Hey, I'm up here.

227
00:11:21,377 --> 00:11:22,210
Hi.

228
00:11:23,676 --> 00:11:25,487
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna ride a train?

229
00:11:25,487 --> 00:11:26,714
For the final ride of the day,

230
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:29,617
we're all as a family riding the train.

231
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:31,367
Front seat for Laura.

232
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,563
- Real choo choo train but little.

233
00:11:34,563 --> 00:11:35,933
- [Jeremy] It's a real train.

234
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:38,998
- Yes, but it's a little teeny tiny.

235
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,645
- [Jeremy] Nae-nae's on the train.

236
00:11:41,645 --> 00:11:43,177
- Oh she likes it.

237
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:44,427
- Wave to Papa.

238
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,550
You turning?

239
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,777
Now make it stop.

240
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,143
Well done.

241
00:11:56,143 --> 00:12:00,834
Legoland is actually premiering
a 4D movie right now.

242
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:02,459
And we just happened to
be here on this night

243
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:05,042
and so we're gonna go watch it.

244
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,861
One of the PR people here at Legoland

245
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:14,557
actually watches J House
vlogs and she saw us

246
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:19,038
and invited us to this little
premiere that they're doing.

247
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,080
They have like popcorn and
cookies and hot chocolate.

248
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,330
This is their new 4D movie.

249
00:12:25,238 --> 00:12:27,629
Where's the best seat?

250
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:29,379
The show is starting.

251
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:49,479
- Do we get to see it again?

252
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:51,430
- 4D movies are cool because they include

253
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,544
so many of the senses.

254
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,261
You have the 3D look, you can feel things,

255
00:12:55,261 --> 00:12:57,235
there's water on you and they just involve

256
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,023
a lot of the senses.

257
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:02,157
So we got a picture
made out of Lego bricks.

258
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,458
It comes apart like a puzzle.

259
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:05,594
- [Kendra] Yeah check
it out, like this one.

260
00:13:05,594 --> 00:13:07,127
See, isn't that awesome.

261
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:08,659
- [Caleb] How did they print it?

262
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:11,562
- [Woman] Machine in the
back and it paints it onto

263
00:13:11,562 --> 00:13:15,068
the Legos and it's made with paint that is

264
00:13:15,068 --> 00:13:17,041
what we like to call play proof.

265
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:19,689
You scratch it, you guys can do-

266
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,407
- [Jeremy] Can I put it
in my mouth and suck on it

267
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:22,568
like Laura will?

268
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,634
- As long as you don't
stick it down your throat.

269
00:13:24,634 --> 00:13:26,771
- [Jeremy] No choking.

270
00:13:26,771 --> 00:13:29,139
Caleb's like, where's the
machine and they're showing us.

271
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:31,879
- [Kendra] So it paints it on
there just like your picture.

272
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,994
- [Jeremy] Kinda like a printer.

273
00:13:32,994 --> 00:13:34,619
We walked out of the
parking lot with Caleb

274
00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:35,710
on my shoulders and we're
walking back into it

275
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,336
with him on my shoulders.

276
00:13:37,336 --> 00:13:39,379
Well Legoland was a lot of fun.

277
00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:41,097
- J House out.

278
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,467
- [Kendra] Wait, you didn't say goodnight.

279
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:44,093
- Goodnight, J House out.

280
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:45,950
- [Kendra] How would
people know to go to bed

281
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,413
if we didn't say goodnight?

282
00:13:47,413 --> 00:13:49,712
- Yeah, especially when they
watch it at two in the morning,

283
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:50,545
afternoon.

284
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,288
- [Kendra] Two in the morning,
I hope they go to bed.

285
00:13:53,288 --> 00:13:55,935
Okay, just to be clear,
if it's your bedtime

286
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:58,001
and you're watching this, good night.

287
00:13:58,001 --> 00:13:59,093
J House out.

288
00:13:59,093 --> 00:14:01,926
- [Jeremy] You guys just chilling?

289
00:14:02,763 --> 00:14:03,855
- We're just chatting.

290
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:06,177
- Jeremy] You can't see it in the fog.

291
00:14:06,177 --> 00:14:07,129
There's a river.

292
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:09,915
I mean imagine if you were
flying down as an alien.

293
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:12,144
It's like they have a
river of red and white,

294
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,188
but the river runs in opposite directions

295
00:14:14,188 --> 00:14:16,069
across from each other.

296
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:19,900
Wait, it's not water,
it's little moving people.

297
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,477
Those aren't people, those
are like machine devices

298
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,310
that carry the humans.

299
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,726
The people on Earth.

300
00:14:26,726 --> 00:14:27,841
You guys just chilling

301
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:29,374
- We're just chatting.

302
00:14:29,374 --> 00:14:30,349
We're just chatting.

303
00:14:30,349 --> 00:14:31,510
- [Jeremy] What do you think
sushi's gonna taste like.

304
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,228
- I don't know.

305
00:14:33,228 --> 00:14:34,830
I'm kinda nervous.

306
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,174
(upbeat music)

307
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:40,728
- [Man] That is a goodbye hug.

308
00:14:40,728 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
