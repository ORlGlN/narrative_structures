1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,510
- This is actually a big deal,

2
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,417
we've never shared our
last name on the vlog.

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:05,300
- 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, 21!

4
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,133
- 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, 21!

5
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,216
- 26, 27, 28, 29, 20, 21!

6
00:00:11,132 --> 00:00:11,965
(yelp)

7
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:14,632
(upbeat techno)

8
00:00:15,898 --> 00:00:17,679
- [Kendra] Janae has a new trick.

9
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:19,148
(baby scream)

10
00:00:19,148 --> 00:00:23,165
She has learned that
she can push the chair.

11
00:00:23,165 --> 00:00:26,442
(baby scream)

12
00:00:26,442 --> 00:00:29,697
She says I can go anywhere I want now!

13
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:30,530
Come on.

14
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,823
(baby scream)

15
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,073
(laughter)

16
00:00:36,324 --> 00:00:38,007
Oh you gonna dance now?

17
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:38,994
(baby squeal)

18
00:00:38,994 --> 00:00:40,512
(Kendra laughs)

19
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:42,444
- Now when we have dance
parties she can dance with us.

20
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:43,658
- [Kendra] She can join in.

21
00:00:43,658 --> 00:00:44,807
- When we first started vlogging,

22
00:00:44,807 --> 00:00:47,768
we had a lot of footage and
data to try to keep ahold of,

23
00:00:47,768 --> 00:00:49,459
so I got external hard drives,

24
00:00:49,459 --> 00:00:51,947
and the first ones I got broke,

25
00:00:51,947 --> 00:00:55,034
and we lost months of footage
and it was devastating.

26
00:00:55,034 --> 00:00:56,927
- It was really scary, you know,

27
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:58,668
these precious pictures and videos

28
00:00:58,668 --> 00:01:01,671
that you have of your kids,
they're literally irreplaceable.

29
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:02,774
So we did a lot of research

30
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:04,816
and we decided to use product by WD

31
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:05,963
and we've been really happy with them.

32
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:07,215
Just makes me feel better to feel

33
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:11,122
like my photos and videos
are in a safe place.

34
00:01:11,122 --> 00:01:15,083
- WD has the My Cloud Home,
and the My Cloud Home Duo.

35
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:16,909
What I love about the My Cloud Home Duo,

36
00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:20,032
is that it can save everything
twice in its mirror mode,

37
00:01:20,032 --> 00:01:21,704
and Caleb is gonna help me set it up.

38
00:01:21,704 --> 00:01:22,574
Are you gonna be my helper?

39
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:23,407
- Yep.

40
00:01:23,407 --> 00:01:24,941
Lock this into here.

41
00:01:24,941 --> 00:01:26,212
Lock this into here.

42
00:01:26,212 --> 00:01:29,771
- Yep, and this is gonna go
right into our wireless router,

43
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,572
and then put this into the outlet.

44
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:34,009
- What is this?

45
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,606
- [Kendra] What do you think it is?

46
00:01:35,606 --> 00:01:36,970
- Is this a cloud?

47
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,761
- Is this a cloud?

48
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,807
Does it get out clouds?

49
00:01:40,807 --> 00:01:42,164
- [Kendra] Does it get out clouds?

50
00:01:42,164 --> 00:01:42,997
- Uh huh.

51
00:01:42,997 --> 00:01:44,167
- No it doesn't make clouds.

52
00:01:44,167 --> 00:01:46,132
- My Cloud Home Duo is a central place

53
00:01:46,132 --> 00:01:47,597
where you can keep all our files.

54
00:01:47,597 --> 00:01:49,690
So these could store your
pictures, your movies,

55
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:51,324
your videos, all from your home,

56
00:01:51,324 --> 00:01:53,374
and there's no monthly charge for this.

57
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,567
And you set up, you can run
it all right from your phone.

58
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:57,589
I'm gonna make an account for you.

59
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,853
- My name's Kendra.

60
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:00,943
So this is actually a big deal,

61
00:02:00,943 --> 00:02:02,702
we've never shared our
last name on the vlog.

62
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:05,892
We've been really
thinking about this a lot,

63
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:07,438
and we think it's time.

64
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,314
So here it goes, we are entering
in my first and last name

65
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,830
to create our account.

66
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,169
(suspenseful music)

67
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,410
(trumpets)

68
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:17,446
- [Jeremy] Johnston.

69
00:02:17,446 --> 00:02:20,682
- Now we can finally tell you
guys the story behind JHouse.

70
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,680
- We get questions all the
time of what does JHouse mean

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,772
and what's our last name,
and they link together.

72
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:29,402
We were initially gonna be The Johnstons.

73
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,427
- Very creative.

74
00:02:30,427 --> 00:02:32,062
- That's what we were gonna call the vlog.

75
00:02:32,062 --> 00:02:32,895
- Very creative.

76
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:34,062
And we knew what kind of a logo we wanted,

77
00:02:34,062 --> 00:02:35,351
we wanted a house with a J in it,

78
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,692
and our awesome brother in law, Sam,

79
00:02:36,692 --> 00:02:38,594
designed our JHouse logo,

80
00:02:38,594 --> 00:02:40,958
and Jeremy and I were
trying to design a page,

81
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,467
and we kept saying like, oh
let's put the JHouse over here,

82
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,148
let's move the JHouse over here,

83
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:46,248
and all of the sudden
we looked at each other

84
00:02:46,248 --> 00:02:47,783
and we're like oh my goodness,

85
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:49,032
our vlog should be called JHouse,

86
00:02:49,032 --> 00:02:50,813
that sounds way cooler than The Johnstons.

87
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,351
We liked having our last
name be kind of private,

88
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:55,541
but over time, you know,
different things have happened

89
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:57,971
where it's now time for
our last name to come out.

90
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,829
Jeremy and his brothers
started a law firm.

91
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,090
- Johnston Law.

92
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,136
- And, there ya have it.

93
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:05,457
So with Johnston Law being where he works,

94
00:03:05,457 --> 00:03:07,402
we knew our last name
was going to eventually

95
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:10,665
come out, and so there you have it.

96
00:03:10,665 --> 00:03:11,897
We are the Johnstons.

97
00:03:11,897 --> 00:03:13,432
- [Jeremy] Let's finish
setting up your account.

98
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,679
So we're just downloading
the app from the app store,

99
00:03:16,679 --> 00:03:20,568
and your photos are now
automatically backed up.

100
00:03:20,568 --> 00:03:21,401
- [Kendra] Already?

101
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:24,141
- [Jeremy] So you can see your
photos are now downloaded in

102
00:03:24,141 --> 00:03:25,822
and if you wanted to take
one of these pictures

103
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,598
you can share it directly from here,

104
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,123
and so I can share to Facebook,

105
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:32,394
I can send it as a message or email.

106
00:03:32,394 --> 00:03:34,204
- [Kendra] Look how cute little Laura is.

107
00:03:34,204 --> 00:03:35,520
- [Jeremy] She's all chillin'.

108
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,353
- [Kendra] Yeah.

109
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:38,679
- Just wanna thank WD for
sponsoring our video today,

110
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:40,102
and you can look in the description box

111
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,746
for a link with more information.

112
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:44,860
So it's overcast and raining
this morning, and just cold,

113
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,260
and so actually feels
like a really good day

114
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,426
to like cozy up and stay home and do some

115
00:03:49,426 --> 00:03:51,183
stay at home things, so
that's what we're doing.

116
00:03:51,183 --> 00:03:52,857
This looks awesome.

117
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,644
- We want it taller than you.

118
00:03:54,644 --> 00:03:55,496
- [Kendra] What?

119
00:03:55,496 --> 00:03:58,746
(playful guitar music)

120
00:04:01,654 --> 00:04:02,737
That is huge.

121
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:15,031
You guys are making a legit skyscraper.

122
00:04:15,031 --> 00:04:17,164
- It's taller than you!

123
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:20,060
- It's taller than me, you did it.

124
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,786
- We're making it taller now.

125
00:04:21,786 --> 00:04:24,214
- It's kind of leaning a little bit.

126
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:25,866
Like it's, it is.

127
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,342
(crash)

128
00:04:27,342 --> 00:04:28,313
- [Caleb] No!

129
00:04:28,313 --> 00:04:29,515
- [Kendra] It was a cool skyscraper dude.

130
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:30,348
- Yeah.

131
00:04:30,348 --> 00:04:31,254
- Dad look.

132
00:04:31,254 --> 00:04:32,727
- [Jeremy] Did you guys do a puzzle.

133
00:04:32,727 --> 00:04:33,560
- Yeah.

134
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,648
- [Jeremy] Who's on the puzzle?

135
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:37,041
You kind of look like Cindy Loo.

136
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:37,874
- I know.

137
00:04:37,874 --> 00:04:39,428
She has blonde hair and I do.

138
00:04:39,428 --> 00:04:40,261
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

139
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:42,763
Is this the puzzle you're working on?

140
00:04:42,763 --> 00:04:43,602
- Mhmm.

141
00:04:43,602 --> 00:04:44,539
- [Jeremy] Awesome, have fun.

142
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,034
- A kiss, and gets a hug,

143
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:49,462
happy holidays for Lama.

144
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:51,703
- So I ordered this off of Amazon

145
00:04:51,703 --> 00:04:53,381
for the kids to play with and decorate.

146
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,554
- [Jeremy] Laura look what Mom got.

147
00:04:55,554 --> 00:04:56,971
- Christmas tree!

148
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,219
- [Kendra] Christmas tree.

149
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:01,240
- Christmas tree toy?

150
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,815
- So it's fabric so we can

151
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:04,847
put like stuff on it to make it decorate.

152
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:07,291
- 25, 26, 27, 28,
- How long are you

153
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:08,587
supposed to hold it for?
- 29, 20, 21,

154
00:05:08,587 --> 00:05:11,640
- I think like 30 seconds.
22, 23, 24, 25,

155
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,792
26, 27, 28, 29, 20!

156
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,022
26, 27, 28, 29, 20!

157
00:05:15,022 --> 00:05:17,298
21, 22
(chuckles)

158
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:18,947
- [Jeremy] You're a great counter.

159
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:20,021
- We did it!

160
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:21,583
- Now let's decorate it.

161
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:25,083

172
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,745

(baby groans)

175
00:05:55,883 --> 00:05:57,224
- [Kendra] You guys, Janae's helping

176
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:59,007
so you guys can do it again.

177
00:05:59,007 --> 00:06:00,473
- [Jeremy] What do you guys
think of the Christmas tree?

178
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:01,550
- I like it.

179
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,300
Where'd it come from?

180
00:06:05,255 --> 00:06:06,754
Awesome.

181
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:08,653
- You can take off everything.

182
00:06:08,653 --> 00:06:12,987
- [Kendra] Mmm candy
canes in the stocking.

183
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:14,122
Very clever.

184
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:17,622
(playful Christmas music)

185
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,431
- Lacy finished the puzzle,
doesn't it look great?

186
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:37,782
- Yeah.

187
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:38,615
(baby squeals)

188
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:39,689
A baby named Jesus.

189
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:42,295
- Yeah, our baby's name is Janae huh,

190
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,592
that's baby Jesus.

191
00:06:43,592 --> 00:06:45,687
(baby squeals)

192
00:06:45,687 --> 00:06:48,206
- So today I was preparing a lesson

193
00:06:48,206 --> 00:06:50,628
that I'm teaching for a church,

194
00:06:50,628 --> 00:06:52,895
and it just got me thinking
about things in my life

195
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:55,970
that I have regretted and
times that I didn't apologize

196
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:56,827
when I should have.

197
00:06:56,827 --> 00:06:59,124
And I actually reached out
to a couple friends today

198
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,337
and apologized for things,

199
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,475
and it really felt good,

200
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:03,288
like it was a weight
lifted off my shoulder,

201
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:04,751
so that's just something to think about,

202
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:05,851
like, if you have regrets

203
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:07,886
or times when you haven't
said you're sorry,

204
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,564
like, life is too short to not reach out,

205
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,249
and to apologize, it felt really good.

206
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:17,416
(inspiring superhero instrumental)

207
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:29,395
So while we're eating dinner,
Janae has learned a new game.

208
00:07:29,395 --> 00:07:30,652
(laughter)

209
00:07:30,652 --> 00:07:31,754
- Uh, oh!

210
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,229
(baby screams)

211
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,479
(laughter)

212
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:38,658
- Uh, oh!

213
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,143
Uh, oh!

214
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,860
Here you go.

215
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,466
- Keep it!

216
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,134
(laughter)

217
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:51,616
- Caleb's hurt so we're dancing for him.

218
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:54,138
(fast paced Christmas music)

219
00:07:54,138 --> 00:07:55,805
- [Jeremy] Nice.

220
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,416
(fast paced Christmas music)

221
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,166
- [All] Joseph went to Bethlehem,

222
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:05,142
and think he took great care along.

223
00:08:06,367 --> 00:08:08,107
- So this Sunday, the kids are singing

224
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:10,750
in church in front of
everybody in the congregation,

225
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,804
and I'm excited, but they're
practicing right now.

226
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:13,966
(all singing)

227
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:17,126
(baby screams)

228
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,131
Do you wanna sing too Nae-Nae.

229
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:21,631
(piano notes)

230
00:08:23,752 --> 00:08:24,972
- I'm keeping it really simple tonight,

231
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,763
we're making Gingerbread
cookies from this mix,

232
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:29,120
but I'm really excited because

233
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,502
we're actually gonna cut em out,

234
00:08:30,502 --> 00:08:31,715
and I got some new cookie cutters,

235
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:33,941
that are actually called
like cookie cutter stamps.

236
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,756
Anyway, lemme show you these.

237
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:37,181
(yelps)

238
00:08:37,182 --> 00:08:38,553
I just dropped it.

239
00:08:38,553 --> 00:08:40,525
Now it's not for that!

240
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,597
The double drop.

241
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:44,014
No don't risk it.

242
00:08:45,304 --> 00:08:46,906
- It's like a normal cookie cutter,

243
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:50,823
and then you press the
stamp function, like so,

244
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:53,661
very hard to hold onto.

245
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:55,135
- Is it glass?

246
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,017
Can I try doing this.

247
00:08:56,017 --> 00:08:58,523
- [Kendra] It's not glass,
it's plastic, thank goodness.

248
00:08:58,523 --> 00:09:00,753
So you push on it.

249
00:09:00,753 --> 00:09:01,586
- How?

250
00:09:01,586 --> 00:09:02,419
- [Kendra] Just like that.

251
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,132
And then it makes it look
like a Christmas tree.

252
00:09:04,132 --> 00:09:06,312
You just need the cookie
dough, should we get it out?

253
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,871
Laura just handed me the cookie cutter

254
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:08,912
and I dropped it again.

255
00:09:08,912 --> 00:09:09,845
- [Jeremy] It's true.

256
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:12,248
Like these are apparently
very slippery cookie cutters,

257
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,102
here I'll show them to you
without picking them up.

258
00:09:14,102 --> 00:09:17,130
This is the kind that I got.

259
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,297
I'm using the infamous Christmas tree.

260
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:24,882
(soft jazz)

261
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,518
(all cheering)

262
00:09:26,518 --> 00:09:28,246
- [Jeremy] Nice, that turned out great.

263
00:09:28,246 --> 00:09:29,155
- [Kendra] I'm so excited.

264
00:09:29,155 --> 00:09:30,334
- [Jeremy] What'd you think Laura?

265
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:31,220
- I like it.

266
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,694
- [Jeremy] That is a pretty cookie.

267
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:36,458
- [Kendra] Okay, now we're doing frosty.

268
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,203
(Christmas jazz)

269
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:41,580
(all cheering)

270
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,906
These are cute!

271
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:46,017
- These cookies are super duperty cute.

272
00:09:46,017 --> 00:09:48,414
I really wanna eat them.

273
00:09:48,414 --> 00:09:50,943
- Wow they look exactly
like a Christmas tree.

274
00:09:50,943 --> 00:09:51,776
- [Kendra] Isn't it cute?

275
00:09:51,776 --> 00:09:52,609
- Yeah.

276
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,098
- [Laura] They're cute.

277
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,576
- [Jeremy] Not just super cute.

278
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,182
- Superdy duperty duperty cute.

279
00:09:58,182 --> 00:10:00,765
- Superdy duperty duperty cute.

280
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:02,545
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

281
00:10:02,545 --> 00:10:04,917
- So growing up, my mom had just a couple,

282
00:10:04,917 --> 00:10:07,088
like maybe three or four cookie cutters

283
00:10:07,088 --> 00:10:09,576
that also had the imprints,
- [Jeremy] Stamps.

284
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:11,551
- the stamps on the
inside, and I love them,

285
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:13,202
and I just thought people
didn't make them anymore

286
00:10:13,202 --> 00:10:14,966
cause none of my cookie
cutters are like that,

287
00:10:14,966 --> 00:10:18,046
and then I discovered they're
called cookie cutter stamps,

288
00:10:18,046 --> 00:10:19,692
so I'm excited, I'm gonna
have to get more of these.

289
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,371
First you push down
the cookie cutter part.

290
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:22,826
And then you push down the stamp.

291
00:10:22,826 --> 00:10:23,911
Op, that's enough,

292
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:26,556
and then you pick it up, and
now you push out the stamp,

293
00:10:26,556 --> 00:10:29,174
there you go, good job.

294
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:32,808
So you put the cookie cutter
in first and then you stamp it.

295
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:34,474
And then we pull it out.

296
00:10:34,474 --> 00:10:35,642
(gasps)

297
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:36,706
There it is.

298
00:10:36,706 --> 00:10:38,707
- [Jeremy] The Rudolph one is pretty cool.

299
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:41,709
- [Kendra] It's hard to get
like all the antlers out.

300
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:42,932
Okay, there we go,

301
00:10:42,932 --> 00:10:44,599
then we push it out.

302
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:46,471
(gasps)

303
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,304
Oh, there it is!

304
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,137
Should we cook them?

305
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:48,970
- One question,

306
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:51,068
which is your favorite
design from the cookies?

307
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,570
We got the Christmas tree, the candy cane,

308
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,153
the snow man, and the reindeer,

309
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,431
so let us know in the poll.

310
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:02,675
(Christmas jazz)

311
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:04,137
(ticking)

312
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:05,062
- [Kendra] Kinda hard to tell if

313
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,991
gingerbread cookies are done or note.

314
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:08,523
Ooo, I'm not sure.

315
00:11:08,523 --> 00:11:10,055
- I'm gonna get dough rash.

316
00:11:10,055 --> 00:11:12,016
- [Kendra] Why are you
gonna get a dough rash.

317
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:14,182
- Cause I just have flour on me.

318
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:15,274
- [Kendra] So you think
cause you have flour

319
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,088
on your hands you're
gonna get a dough rash?

320
00:11:17,088 --> 00:11:20,588
- If I have it on after
bed time then I will.

321
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:21,928
- [Kendra] Oh so we gotta wash your hands?

322
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:24,253
- Yeah, right now.

323
00:11:24,253 --> 00:11:25,086
(pounding)

324
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,023
- [All] You better not pout,

325
00:11:26,023 --> 00:11:27,018
I'm telling your why,

326
00:11:27,018 --> 00:11:29,685
Santa Clause is coming, to town!

327
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,828
We just got white frosting right now,

328
00:11:33,828 --> 00:11:35,048
so you can use white frosting

329
00:11:35,048 --> 00:11:37,664
and sprinkles to make little designs.

330
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:38,500
- [Jeremy] Looks good.

331
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,333
(Christmas techo)

332
00:11:57,764 --> 00:11:58,597
- [Isaac] Help.

333
00:11:58,597 --> 00:12:00,693
- [Kendra] Did you put a
little too much sprinklers?

334
00:12:00,693 --> 00:12:03,860
The key is to kind of pour it lightly?

335
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:06,926
- [Jeremy] How's decorating going?

336
00:12:06,926 --> 00:12:07,759
- Good.

337
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:09,942
- [Jeremy] Standard for Laura.

338
00:12:09,942 --> 00:12:11,323
- [Caleb] Ugh, I'm done.

339
00:12:11,323 --> 00:12:12,230
- [Lucy] Glasses.

340
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,873
- [Kendra] Glasses, a
snow man with glasses!

341
00:12:14,873 --> 00:12:15,885
(baby grunts)

342
00:12:15,885 --> 00:12:17,119
- [Kendra] You wanna do it?

343
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:18,630
- I wanna eat it!

344
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,623
- [Kendra] Sorry, baby, next year.

345
00:12:20,623 --> 00:12:21,818
(baby screeches)

346
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:25,205
- We've been watching videos of Laura.

347
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,101
Janae looks just like
Laura did at this age.

348
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:30,174
- [Kendra] This is your future Janae.

349
00:12:30,174 --> 00:12:31,938
Nae-Nae you can help daddy decorate one.

350
00:12:31,938 --> 00:12:33,400
- [Lucy] Stop it!

351
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,447
- [Isaac] I've done all mine.

352
00:12:34,447 --> 00:12:35,532
(baby squeals)

353
00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,087
(laughter)

354
00:12:37,087 --> 00:12:38,098
- They're good.

355
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,945
- [Kendra] You like gingerbread don't you?

356
00:12:39,945 --> 00:12:40,840
- It's good.

357
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,265
- [Kendra] You like it?

358
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,286
It's a lot of frosting there dude.

359
00:12:44,286 --> 00:12:48,543
So I'm putting Laura to
bed, and I found this.

360
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:49,768
- I put it to bed.

361
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,735
- [Kendra] You put her to bed?

362
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,327
- Mhmm, it's my baby.

363
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:53,531
- [Kendra] Was she hard to put to bed

364
00:12:53,531 --> 00:12:54,596
or was she pretty easy?

365
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:55,429
- It was pretty easy.

366
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:59,179
- [Kendra] What did you
do to put her to bed?

367
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,641
- Just carry her, then I
took off the blanket off her,

368
00:13:04,641 --> 00:13:08,058
then I just literally just made this bed,

369
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:10,443
cute for her.

370
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:11,756
- [Kendra] Nice, it is very cute for her.

371
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:14,528
- Then she can have
this and this and this.

372
00:13:14,528 --> 00:13:16,041
- [Kendra] Oh she's gonna
have lots of covers on her.

373
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:16,874
- Mhmm.

374
00:13:18,566 --> 00:13:20,665
- [Kendra] Are you gonna
sing her some songs?

375
00:13:20,665 --> 00:13:24,134
- Not really, she just
goes to bed all by herself.

376
00:13:24,134 --> 00:13:25,446
- [Kendra] What a big girl she is.

377
00:13:25,446 --> 00:13:28,903
- She is like, um, one year old.

378
00:13:28,903 --> 00:13:29,887
- [Kendra] What's her name?

379
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:30,720
- Rose.

380
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,750
- [Kendra] That's a pretty name.

381
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,047
- She knows how to say mommy and daddy.

382
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:35,880
At night she has

383
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,289
(mumbles inaudibly)

384
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:42,510
- [Kendra] This was disgusting.

385
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:44,322
- [Jeremy] Hey Luce what
happened to your glasses?

386
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:45,724
- Oh Janae broke them.

387
00:13:45,724 --> 00:13:47,155
(laughter)

388
00:13:47,155 --> 00:13:48,724
(baby squeals)

389
00:13:48,724 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat jazz music)
