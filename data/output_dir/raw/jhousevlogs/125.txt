1
00:00:00,384 --> 00:00:01,517
(bright music)

2
00:00:01,517 --> 00:00:02,350
- Quiet.

3
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:05,031
- I got it, no!

4
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:07,233
(Kendra yells)

5
00:00:07,233 --> 00:00:08,066
- Whoa.

6
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,365
Socks!

7
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:12,115
- [Child] Good job, blow 'em out.

8
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,256
- [Kendra] Good morning
friends, what day is it?

9
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:18,168
- [All] Dad's birthday.

10
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:19,316
- While he's gone playing racquetball

11
00:00:19,316 --> 00:00:20,501
with his dad and his
brothers this morning,

12
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:21,431
(Janae screaming)

13
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:23,006
we are going to get his presents ready

14
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:23,948
and some breakfast ready

15
00:00:23,948 --> 00:00:26,249
and Janae's apparently
really excited about it.

16
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:28,832
(upbeat music)

17
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,456
- So it's my birthday today.

18
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:36,592
I'm really excited.

19
00:00:36,592 --> 00:00:37,425
And I'm starting the
day playing racquetball

20
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:40,333
with my dad who just flew into town

21
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,239
and my brother.

22
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:43,189
- I'm gonna win.

23
00:00:43,189 --> 00:00:45,983
(uptempo dance music)

24
00:00:45,983 --> 00:00:48,650
(hitting balls)

25
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:55,809
- Two wins for me, it is my birthday

26
00:00:55,809 --> 00:01:00,411
so they might be playing
easy, but it still feels good.

27
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,128
- [Kendra] It's card making time.

28
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,022
Laura, tell me about your card.

29
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,432
Look at all those L's.

30
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:08,967
Here's a picture of Laura and Daddy

31
00:01:08,967 --> 00:01:10,535
and here's the boys.

32
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:12,780
Caleb, that is such a sweet note.

33
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,090
Isaac is Dad in all yellow?

34
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:15,987
- Yeah.

35
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:17,185
- I love it.

36
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:18,177
Poor Janae is too little to color.

37
00:01:18,177 --> 00:01:20,640
I think she's upset I won't
let her eat the markers.

38
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,473
- I love Dad.

39
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:23,637
I want to marry a guy that's like him.

40
00:01:23,637 --> 00:01:25,690
- [Kendra] You want to marry
a guy that's like your dad?

41
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,842
- I love you Dad.

42
00:01:26,842 --> 00:01:29,162
I'm so glad you are in my family.

43
00:01:29,162 --> 00:01:30,867
Love, Caleb.

44
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,261
- [Kendra] Whoa, what is that?

45
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:33,525
- A dinosaur.

46
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:34,564
- [Kendra] This is a dinosaur?

47
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:35,397
- Yeah.

48
00:01:35,397 --> 00:01:36,469
- [Kendra] It's very abstract.

49
00:01:36,469 --> 00:01:38,659
- Your honey will love this one,

50
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:39,492
it's made out of stripes.

51
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:41,740
- [Kendra] Did you say my
honey will love that one?

52
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,481
- Yeah, cause it's yours to give to Dad.

53
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:45,945
- [Kendra] Oh that's so nice.

54
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:47,503
Thanks for making a card for my bag.

55
00:01:47,503 --> 00:01:48,475
Who's home?

56
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:49,308
- Dad!

57
00:01:49,308 --> 00:01:50,500
- How are you guys?

58
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,319
- [All] Happy birthday!

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,152
- Good to see ya.

60
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,617
- She wanted to say hi to Daddy too.

61
00:01:55,617 --> 00:01:56,566
- She crawled from way over there.

62
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:57,553
- Come here.

63
00:01:57,553 --> 00:01:58,675
- [Kendra] How was your racquetball?

64
00:01:58,675 --> 00:01:59,508
- It was good.

65
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,217
I won the first two games,

66
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:02,373
and then I lost the last one.

67
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:03,654
I wanted to sweep the whole day,

68
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:05,764
but I was worn out.

69
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:07,071
- For Jeremy's birthday
breakfast this morning,

70
00:02:07,071 --> 00:02:09,770
we are having eggs, hash browns and bacon,

71
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,982
and fruit smoothies.

72
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:13,747
(blender whirring)

73
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:14,664
- Be quiet.

74
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:20,502
- [Kendra] We made a lot
of smoothie this morning.

75
00:02:20,502 --> 00:02:21,335
How's the smoothie?

76
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:22,272
- It's very good.

77
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:24,627
- [Kendra] Jeremy is the
master of cooking eggs.

78
00:02:24,627 --> 00:02:27,877
- I'm no master, but it is yummy stuff.

79
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,600
Oh I got, oh!
- Ahh!

80
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:34,190
- The master?

81
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,669
I need a spoon.

82
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,669
Can I get the yoke without cracking?

83
00:02:39,805 --> 00:02:41,883
- [Kendra] Awww.

84
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:43,195
We'll get some paper towels.

85
00:02:43,195 --> 00:02:44,402
- So this is a special breakfast for me.

86
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:45,618
I'd love to know in the comments

87
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:48,559
what a special breakfast is for you.

88
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:51,021
Another special breakfast is crepes.

89
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,614
I love Swedish pancakes, where you roll

90
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,488
it up with whipped cream
and strawberries and stuff.

91
00:02:55,488 --> 00:02:57,040
That's really amazing as well.

92
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,784
- Jeremy got some work done this morning

93
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,873
and now he is out golfing with his dad

94
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:02,219
and his brothers, and
I'm so happy for him.

95
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,349
He never gets to do that kind of stuff.

96
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,872
And it's important to play and have fun.

97
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:07,630
I actually just read an article all about

98
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,463
the importance of play,

99
00:03:08,463 --> 00:03:09,470
and not just in a kid's life

100
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,813
but in an adult's life too.

101
00:03:10,813 --> 00:03:11,997
So Laura, what are we gonna make?

102
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:14,421
- We're gonna make the birthday cake.

103
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:15,254
- [Kendra] For Daddy?

104
00:03:15,254 --> 00:03:18,332
- Yeah, and it's gonna
be with this and this.

105
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,165
- [Kendra] Okay, so we got some

106
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,119
of the ingredients right here.

107
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:21,934
What's the name of the kind of cake it is.

108
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:22,767
- Chocolate.

109
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:25,501
- [Kendra] Not chocolate,
it's called pistachio.

110
00:03:25,501 --> 00:03:26,773
- Pistachio.

111
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,685
I don't like that name.

112
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,055
- [Kendra] You don't like that name?

113
00:03:30,055 --> 00:03:31,972
- Let's name it yellow.

114
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:36,888
- [Kendra] Alright, so you
start with the cake mix.

115
00:03:36,888 --> 00:03:39,089
Oil, add three eggs

116
00:03:39,089 --> 00:03:42,129
and the secret ingredient
is a cup of Sprite.

117
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,216
Now we're gonna mix it up.

118
00:03:43,216 --> 00:03:44,512
- It's mixing it up.

119
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,478
- [Kendra] It is mixing it up.

120
00:03:45,478 --> 00:03:47,105
Now we're gonna put it in the oven.

121
00:03:47,105 --> 00:03:49,948
(lively big band music)

122
00:03:49,948 --> 00:03:51,647
There's the pistachio cake.

123
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:52,673
We just mixed up the frosting.

124
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:56,667
It's pistachio pudding,
Cool Whip and milk.

125
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,671
- I think you should
add a little more sugar.

126
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:00,881
- [Kendra] You think so?

127
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,381
The cake is ready.

128
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,702
(bright music)

129
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,626
Well while there's been
some birthday elements

130
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:11,820
of our day today, there's also been

131
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,532
a lot of normal regular life.

132
00:04:13,532 --> 00:04:15,924
I'm doing laundry, the
kids did their chores,

133
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:16,757
they're jumping on the trampoline

134
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,793
and Laura and I are hanging out,

135
00:04:18,793 --> 00:04:20,255
because Laura is feeling particularly

136
00:04:20,255 --> 00:04:21,503
nervous about something.

137
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:23,208
Since the big storm that
we had just a couple

138
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,306
of days ago, she's not
wanting to go outside,

139
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,158
she's not even wanting
to be in different rooms

140
00:04:27,158 --> 00:04:28,949
of the house than Jeremy and I.

141
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:32,380
She pretty much just
wants to hang right by us.

142
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,655
And we keep reassuring
her, our house is safe.

143
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:38,289
There's no storm today, it's sunshiney,

144
00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:39,613
what can I do to help you feel better?

145
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,708
- Just a snack will help me.

146
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,541
- Oh.

147
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,374
- Just food will help me.

148
00:04:43,374 --> 00:04:44,862
- Just a snack, huh?

149
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:46,385
(bright jazzy music)

150
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:47,802
- Get in, get in.

151
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,781
That's about as close as it gets.

152
00:04:54,456 --> 00:04:55,594
Oh.

153
00:04:55,594 --> 00:04:58,459
So we're out golfing with
my brothers and my dad,

154
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,243
perfect way to spend my birthday.

155
00:05:00,243 --> 00:05:02,491
(hitting balls)

156
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:04,811
It's such a beautiful day today,

157
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,978
the clouds are incredible.

158
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,007
- [Dad] Beautiful.

159
00:05:10,862 --> 00:05:11,695
- Did it go over?

160
00:05:11,695 --> 00:05:13,083
I hit a good shot.

161
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,899
So I'm 35 years old.

162
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,123
This last year, so many
amazing things happened.

163
00:05:18,123 --> 00:05:20,739
I had my fifth kid, Kendra and I have made

164
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:21,785
a lot of progress with our marriage.

165
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:22,663
We did counseling,

166
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:25,267
which was really important.

167
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:27,008
We hit a million subscribers
with our channel,

168
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:30,754
we bought our house, we started
a law firm with my brother,

169
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:32,082
I just feel really blessed.

170
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,343
Well I guess the kids all disappeared,

171
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,316
I hate when that happens.

172
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:37,605
- Happy birthday Dad.

173
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,954
- Happy birthday!
- Hey hey.

174
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,914
- Wow!
- Happy birthday!

175
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:42,171
- Happy birthday!

176
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:44,555
(laughing)

177
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,152
- It's time for Jeremy
to open his presents.

178
00:05:46,152 --> 00:05:48,562
Each of the kids has a present for him.

179
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:50,718
- Did you draw me a card?

180
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:51,883
What did you write?

181
00:05:51,883 --> 00:05:55,883
- I hope you hae a fun
time golfing and playing.

182
00:05:57,722 --> 00:05:59,503
- Thanks, that's what that says.

183
00:05:59,503 --> 00:06:00,670
- That is fun.

184
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:04,423
Everybody, Janae and Mom and Dad

185
00:06:07,754 --> 00:06:10,790
and Laura and Elise and Caleb

186
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,873
and Isaac love each other from Laura.

187
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:18,145
- She loves her L's and H's.

188
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,812
There's L's and H's.

189
00:06:21,927 --> 00:06:23,462
What?

190
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,545
A new tie?

191
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:25,928
(laughing)

192
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,261
I love this tie.

193
00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:29,464
Can I try it on?

194
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:30,608
- Sure.

195
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:31,441
- And

196
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:34,798
how's my tie?
- What do you think?

197
00:06:34,798 --> 00:06:35,631
- Great.

198
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,687
Tell everybody that you have a new tie.

199
00:06:38,687 --> 00:06:40,103
- I have a new tie.

200
00:06:40,103 --> 00:06:41,287
(laughing)

201
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:43,362
Whoa, tis one's in a big bag.

202
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:45,034
This one's kinda heavy too.

203
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,292
Do you want to help me?

204
00:06:46,292 --> 00:06:47,959
Alright, let's see.

205
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:50,463
Monopoly Jr.

206
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,216
I have wanted to play this
with my kids my whole life.

207
00:06:55,216 --> 00:06:56,568
Can we play this?

208
00:06:56,568 --> 00:06:57,401
- Yeah.

209
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,234
- Okay.

210
00:06:58,234 --> 00:06:59,618
- Happy birthday Dad.

211
00:06:59,618 --> 00:07:00,697
I love you Dad.

212
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:02,787
I'm so glad you are in my family.

213
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:03,940
Love, Caleb.

214
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,773
- Thanks buddy.

215
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:05,606
- A snake.

216
00:07:05,606 --> 00:07:06,929
(record scratches)

217
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:09,310
- And then a drawing of a snake.

218
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,125
- Where's the dinosaur?

219
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,540
- This one's super heavy.

220
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,845
Happy birthday Dad.

221
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:17,329
You picked good colors.

222
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,589
And a rainbow?

223
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,942
- A sunset.

224
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,275
- It's a sunset.

225
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,898
Dad I love you Dad.

226
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:26,985
You are the best.

227
00:07:26,985 --> 00:07:27,818
Whoa!

228
00:07:29,243 --> 00:07:30,658
- Your own root beer!

229
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,233
- Well I might need to
share it with somebody.

230
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,721
- Me me me.
- Yeah!

231
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:35,855
- All of us!

232
00:07:35,855 --> 00:07:36,688
- Root beer.

233
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:38,760
- I'm a big root beer
fan, there's no question,

234
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,836
so thank you.

235
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,467
Alright, let's see the card first.

236
00:07:42,467 --> 00:07:45,134
From Isaac, Dad, happy birthday.

237
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:47,612
Ooh, go KC.

238
00:07:49,543 --> 00:07:50,796
That's a really good drawing.

239
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:53,129
- No offense to Raiders fan.
- Isn't it impressive?

240
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:55,125
- Yeah, no offense to any other fans.

241
00:07:55,125 --> 00:07:57,130
KC's the best, number one.

242
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:58,602
Alright, happy birthday Dad.

243
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:01,935
I hope you have a good and fun birthday.

244
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:05,208
Thank you for being my dad, I love you

245
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,295
and thank you for playing

246
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:09,008
and watching sports with me, love Isaac.

247
00:08:09,008 --> 00:08:11,675
I love watching sports with you.

248
00:08:15,048 --> 00:08:19,946
- I picked last, so, it's
kind of an interesting gift.

249
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:22,425
- This might be my favorite present.

250
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:24,175
Let's see what it is.

251
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:26,827
Socks!
(dramatic music)

252
00:08:26,827 --> 00:08:27,660
Thank you.

253
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,039
I've been wanting socks!

254
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:33,168
I appreciate it.

255
00:08:33,168 --> 00:08:36,732
- [Kendra] Last but not
least is Kendra's present.

256
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:40,677
- Kendra has never, almost never I think

257
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:42,190
kept a secret from me.

258
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,092
Or a present, have you ever done it?

259
00:08:44,092 --> 00:08:46,596
- [Kendra] I can usually keep
a secret for like two minutes.

260
00:08:46,596 --> 00:08:47,429
- That's about it.
- Maybe.

261
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,701
- So I have no idea what's coming.

262
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:50,602
I know you've worked on it a bit, so.

263
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:52,283
Kendra's been super cute about it though

264
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:54,261
with her qualifying, 'cause she's like

265
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,394
I know she's making something

266
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:58,192
but she keeps downplaying
it, like this is really dumb,

267
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,190
it's really not a big deal,

268
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,087
she's been really cute about it.

269
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,398
- It's just silly and simple.

270
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:03,231
- It's just silly and simple.

271
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:04,064
- [Kendra] It's just fun.

272
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:05,109
- I want Kendra next to me,

273
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,877
just in case this is like a prank

274
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:07,725
and it all is gonna blow up.

275
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,030
- Do you want me to help
you open it, like the kids?

276
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,863
- Yeah, okay.

277
00:09:09,863 --> 00:09:11,574
I feel bubble wrap.

278
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,390
- Go to the side of the bubble wrap first.

279
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:16,147
- The side, is there
like more than one thing?

280
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:17,980
Okay, so, it's a mask.

281
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:20,993
- You might need it.

282
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,832
- Why would I need a mask?

283
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:26,165
- It's a hammer.

284
00:09:30,936 --> 00:09:31,769
Smash me.

285
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,200
You made something.

286
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,120
- Yeah.

287
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,704
- You guys, it says smash me.

288
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,807
- Your presents inside of there.

289
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,143
- Smash me.

290
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:42,631
- Okay, let's go, do
you want to go outside

291
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:43,776
and find your present?

292
00:09:43,776 --> 00:09:45,175
- Let's do it.

293
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,008
Here we go.

294
00:09:46,008 --> 00:09:46,994
(uptempo rock music)

295
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:48,119
(hammering)

296
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:49,452
- [Kendra] Whoa.

297
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:54,380
That thing is tough.

298
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,021
- So this thing is more
solid than I expected,

299
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:59,284
I'm gonna need a not kid
hammer and not doing it

300
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,596
on the table.

301
00:10:00,596 --> 00:10:03,358
Should I get a chisel, so
I don't hurt the present?

302
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:04,191
- [Kendra] Maybe.

303
00:10:04,191 --> 00:10:06,625
- 'Cause look I can see
the present in here.

304
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:07,458
- [Kendra] Oh.

305
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,291
- [Jeremy] Don't hurt your hands.

306
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:12,124
- [Kendra] We decided
to let the kids all try.

307
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,945
- So I think I'm gonna
try to chisel it out,

308
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:18,896
so I don't damage what's inside.

309
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:21,229
(chiseling)

310
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:25,095
(Kendra laughing)

311
00:10:25,095 --> 00:10:28,845
- [Kendra] That thing's
like really in there.

312
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:34,943
- I'm gonna try to
actually hit it my hardest.

313
00:10:34,943 --> 00:10:35,828
I haven't done that yet,

314
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:37,813
so let's see how it goes.

315
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:39,230
- [Kendra] Uh-oh.

316
00:10:40,135 --> 00:10:44,074
(yelling and laughing)

317
00:10:44,074 --> 00:10:45,751
So here's where we're at.

318
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:49,273
- To finish this off, I
needed a solid foundation.

319
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:50,972
There we go.
- Woo hoo!

320
00:10:50,972 --> 00:10:51,805
- Alright.

321
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:54,337
It's to go to to a movie.

322
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,170
- [Kendra] Yeah.

323
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,873
- We never go to movies and I love movies

324
00:10:57,873 --> 00:10:59,890
and it might even still work.

325
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,723
- [Kendra] Happy birthday.

326
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:02,678
- Thank you so much.

327
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:04,309
So I've had several members
of my family and friends

328
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:06,509
say that they hope I have
a good sunset tonight

329
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:07,813
for my birthday.

330
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:08,646
- 'Cause they know how much you love them.

331
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,058
- Yeah, isn't that thoughtful?

332
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:11,669
It is a good sunset.

333
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:12,557
- It's beautiful out here.

334
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:13,839
- [Jeremy] So the kids are at gymnastics.

335
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,457
- They are, it's gymnastics night.

336
00:11:16,457 --> 00:11:19,796
So today has been such a
great day in some moments,

337
00:11:19,796 --> 00:11:22,982
and so darn annoying in other moments.

338
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,651
You I think when the
kids get really excited

339
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:26,017
about a special day,

340
00:11:26,017 --> 00:11:28,178
it's really hard for them
to behave appropriately,

341
00:11:28,178 --> 00:11:31,369
abd so we've been dealing
with discipline issues.

342
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:32,909
That's just real life,
it's just real life,

343
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,237
like I feel like this moment doesn't fit

344
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:36,165
in this beautiful vlog,

345
00:11:36,165 --> 00:11:39,012
because we've got all
these wonderful memories

346
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:40,051
and all these happy things happening,

347
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:41,611
and then you turn around

348
00:11:41,611 --> 00:11:43,683
and somebody's hitting their sibling

349
00:11:43,683 --> 00:11:45,715
and somebody else is
whining about something

350
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,355
and that's just real life.

351
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:48,383
So we had some other things,

352
00:11:48,383 --> 00:11:50,075
we had hoped to go out to a restaurant

353
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:50,946
with the family tonight

354
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:53,186
and the kids just weren't
behaving well enough for that.

355
00:11:53,186 --> 00:11:55,794
So instead we stayed
home and had hot dogs.

356
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:58,377
(lively music)

357
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:11,450
(Jeremy laughing)

358
00:12:14,636 --> 00:12:16,362
- [Jeremy] Elise.

359
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:17,636
Do you want to go home and
have cake and ice cream?

360
00:12:17,636 --> 00:12:18,995
- Yeah, yum.

361
00:12:18,995 --> 00:12:21,334
- [Kendra] Here's our
version of 35 candles.

362
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:24,934

365
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:35,702
(clapping)

366
00:12:41,197 --> 00:12:43,178
- [Kendra] Go for it.

367
00:12:43,178 --> 00:12:45,428
(cheering)

368
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:49,621
- I didn't spit, I didn't spit.

369
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:50,826
- [Kendra] Alright, who
wants cake and ice cream?

370
00:12:50,826 --> 00:12:51,743
- [All] Me!

371
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,633
- So one of my favorite parts of this cake

372
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:57,803
is the frosting isn't the normal
rich buttercream frosting,

373
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:01,803
it's like a light whipped
pistachio amazingness.

374
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:03,841
It's so good.

375
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:06,279
The kids have prepared
an interpretive dance

376
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:08,038
to celebrate my birthday.

377
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:11,371
- [Narrator] Jeremy, a man of good deeds

378
00:13:13,047 --> 00:13:14,714
who cares and loves.

379
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:19,416
Today it's his birthday.

380
00:13:26,523 --> 00:13:29,106
Jeremy loves to sing and dance.

381
00:13:34,405 --> 00:13:36,572
And today he's turning 35.

382
00:13:39,564 --> 00:13:41,191
- [Jeremy] 25, I would've gone for that.

383
00:13:41,191 --> 00:13:43,358
- [Narrator] That's a lot.

384
00:13:45,966 --> 00:13:47,799

- [Kendra] New pajamas.

388
00:13:57,056 --> 00:13:58,956
- We thought it might
help her for her audition,

389
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,777
to practice in front of all of you.

390
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:02,860
- [Kendra] There he goes.

391
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:06,597

392
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,542
