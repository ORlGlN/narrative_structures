1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,418
- [Kendra] Well, Janae
attracts a crowd I think.

2
00:00:03,418 --> 00:00:05,733
- [Elise] Are you ready to have fun?

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,025
- [Kendra] Is she smiling again?

4
00:00:07,025 --> 00:00:08,275
Oh there it is!

5
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:10,732
Hi Janae!

6
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:11,565
Oop!

7
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:13,063
- [Elise] A frown!

8
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:14,614
(giggling)

9
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,389
- [Kendra] Aww, that looks so sad.

10
00:00:16,389 --> 00:00:17,222
Oop.

11
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,368
(laughter)

12
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:24,140
Yay, you are a trickster.

13
00:00:25,873 --> 00:00:27,728
- [Elise] Aw, she's still crying.

14
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,139
(laughter)

15
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:33,315
- [Kendra] She's a smile-crier.

16
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,815
(upbeat electronic music)

17
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,339
- [All] 15, 14, 13,

18
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,172
two, one.

19
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:41,820
two, one.

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,320
(loud repetitive banging)

21
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:49,725
(cheering and yelling)

22
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:52,975
(cheering and yelling)

23
00:00:54,502 --> 00:00:56,135
- [Kendra] We were in our room yesterday

24
00:00:56,135 --> 00:00:57,246
and we were cleaning up,

25
00:00:57,246 --> 00:00:58,783
and we found another present

26
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,080
that was just sitting there,

27
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,175
do you guys wanna open it?

28
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:02,352
- [All] Yeah!

29
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,852
- [Kendra] Where are we going?

30
00:01:06,487 --> 00:01:08,400
- [All] Disney World!

31
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,013
(cheering)

32
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:10,846
Yay!

33
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:15,765
(exciting screams)

34
00:01:15,765 --> 00:01:17,515
- Disney World shirt!

35
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:21,485
(magical music)

36
00:01:25,632 --> 00:01:27,301
- [Jeremy] Say Disney!

37
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:28,551
- [All] Disney!

38
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:32,459
- It's everything you ever
wanted to know about Disney Land.

39
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,292
- Really?

40
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,125
- Yeah.

41
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:35,800
- How do they go so fast?

42
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,385
- [Jeremy] The pilots up front

43
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:39,951
they kick really hard with
their legs against the ground

44
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:43,886
and run faster and faster
and faster until we take off.

45
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,719
- Like kicked it away?

46
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,061
- [Jeremy] Like they're running, yeah,

47
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:49,145
so their legs are down in the ground

48
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:52,049
and they're running as hard
and as fast as they can.

49
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:53,641
- Really?

50
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:55,601
- [Jeremy] No, I'm just joking.

51
00:01:55,601 --> 00:01:57,934
(chuckling)

52
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:01,013
- How would they get?

53
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:04,716
That's so funny.

54
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:07,383
(upbeat techno)

55
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:15,861
- [Kendra] So, we are
taking my kids to the ocean

56
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,494
for the very first time today,

57
00:02:17,494 --> 00:02:20,716
and I'm so excited to live
these moments with them,

58
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:22,821
it's just magical.

59
00:02:22,821 --> 00:02:24,988
What do you think of this?

60
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:30,484
- There's like a whole entire part of just

61
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:33,416
the part that they water comes on.

62
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,084
- [Kendra] Yeah, it's called a beach.

63
00:02:35,084 --> 00:02:37,358
I'm so happy to be here!

64
00:02:37,358 --> 00:02:40,248
(ocean waves)

65
00:02:40,248 --> 00:02:42,831
- [Elise] There's another wave!

66
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:46,801
I'm scared.

67
00:02:47,995 --> 00:02:50,495
(ocean waves)

68
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,923
(squeals)

69
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,956
(laughter)

70
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:56,187
- Here it comes, here it comes!

71
00:02:56,187 --> 00:02:58,477
(squeals)

72
00:02:58,477 --> 00:03:00,644
(shrieks)

73
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:04,517
(excited murmur)

74
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,497
(squeals)

75
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,541
This is awesome.

76
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:19,208
(squeals)

77
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,375
(shrieks)

78
00:03:24,481 --> 00:03:26,148
- It's getting high.

79
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:29,558
(chuckles)

80
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:31,422
That's amazing!

81
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:34,089
(magical music)

82
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:40,129
(excited singing)

83
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:42,877
- Okay, let's take a picture.

84
00:03:42,877 --> 00:03:45,544
Are you going inside the castle?

85
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,212
- Yeah!

86
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:49,156
- We're winning!

87
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:51,498
- [Jeremy] We're winning,
oh no they're winning!

88
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,215
(excited screams)

89
00:03:53,215 --> 00:03:56,017
(Dad cheering)

90
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:58,850
- [Jeremy] Oh, they won, they won.

91
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:01,082
- That was fun.

92
00:04:01,082 --> 00:04:03,883
- When you went down it kind
oh made your tummy feel weird.

93
00:04:03,883 --> 00:04:05,300
(chuckles)

94
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,282
- [Announcer] Walt Disney presents.

95
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:09,949
(magical music)

96
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:14,308
- [Jeremy] Who's that?

97
00:04:17,403 --> 00:04:18,904
♪ Wish I could be. ♪

98
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,866
♪ Just look at the world around you. ♪

99
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,867
(suspenseful music)

100
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,973
(cheering)

101
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:30,556
(finale music)

102
00:04:32,503 --> 00:04:35,085
(cheering)

103
00:04:35,085 --> 00:04:36,499
- What'd you think of that?

104
00:04:36,499 --> 00:04:37,421
- Lots of smoke in the sky.

105
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:39,432
- Lots of smoke in the sky.

106
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:40,265
- Whoa.

107
00:04:40,265 --> 00:04:42,662
- It's a Cinderella dress.

108
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:43,514
(gasps)

109
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:45,523
- It's a Cinderella dress?

110
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:46,356
- Uh huh.

111
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:47,189
- [Kendra] It is.

112
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,022
- Thank you!

113
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:49,903
- You're welcome!

114
00:04:49,903 --> 00:04:52,653
(romantic music)

115
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:58,331
- [Jeremy] Who wants
some cake and ice cream?

116
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,664
- I want that one!

117
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:04,497
- [All] Happy Birthday dear Laura,

118
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,595
happy birthday to you!

119
00:05:07,595 --> 00:05:09,428
happy birthday to you!

120
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:16,296
- [Jeremy] So how do
you like your tool belt?

121
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:17,529
- Good.

122
00:05:17,529 --> 00:05:18,896
How's the ice cream?

123
00:05:18,896 --> 00:05:20,346
- Awesome!

124
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:23,041
- [Jeremy] That was a big old bite.

125
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:26,167
Now you have to actually eat that.

126
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,516
Brain freeze.

127
00:05:27,516 --> 00:05:28,927
- You okay?

128
00:05:28,927 --> 00:05:31,538
(Jeremy chuckles)

129
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:32,447
(Jeremy chuckles)

130
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:34,075
- [All] Birthday to you!

131
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:35,616
(cheering)

132
00:05:35,616 --> 00:05:38,866
(encouraging cheering)

133
00:05:42,277 --> 00:05:45,610
(clapping and cheering)

134
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:50,205
(playful instrumental music)

135
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:52,686
- [Elise] This is official.

136
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,250
- [Jeremy] What happened to these?

137
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,097
- Mmm well, I took, Caleb was laughing.

138
00:05:57,097 --> 00:05:59,295
- So Elise was laughing
so hard after she took

139
00:05:59,295 --> 00:06:01,103
a drink of strawberry
milk that it literally

140
00:06:01,103 --> 00:06:03,351
bubbled up and came out of her nose.

141
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:04,859
I've never seen that happen before.

142
00:06:04,859 --> 00:06:05,765
(giggling)

143
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,333
Well it was awesome to get
to visit with my friends

144
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,890
and they're so sweet and generous.

145
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,461
They brought all these donations for

146
00:06:11,461 --> 00:06:12,771
the pregnancy resource center,

147
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,647
and it's just fun to see
cute little baby items

148
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:16,002
and to know that they're going somewhere

149
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,341
where they're going to be needed.

150
00:06:17,341 --> 00:06:20,104
- [Caleb] We've never had four out!

151
00:06:20,104 --> 00:06:23,289
- [Jeremy] Alright,
have fun little chicks.

152
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,456
(giggles)

153
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:31,309
- Oh they have a certain dance.

154
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,092
So they jump, and then peck at each other,

155
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,458
jump, then peck at each other.

156
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:36,559
- They're kissing.

157
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,683
Well I'm really glad
that we had the chicks,

158
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:41,623
it brings out like a softness
and a tenderness of your heart

159
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:43,934
to have a pet that you're caring for

160
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:46,349
that you want to survive,
that you wanna take care of,

161
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:49,534
and it's really fun to see
the kids interacting with them

162
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,912
and seeing them grow.

163
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,877
- Do you wanna play fetch buddy?

164
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:53,710
Go get it!

165
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:59,281
- [Jeremy] They're going,
they're going after it.

166
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:02,550
(baby crying)

167
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,603
- [Kendra] Hi sweetheart!

168
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:05,037
Hi!

169
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,787
Aww.
(baby cries)

170
00:07:09,202 --> 00:07:11,369
Yeah, yeah that was rough.

171
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:13,362
Hi.

172
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,805
Guys, I had a baby.

173
00:07:21,805 --> 00:07:23,413
(sighs)

174
00:07:23,413 --> 00:07:25,516
- [Jeremy] You did amazing, good job.

175
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:26,349
- Thanks.

176
00:07:33,811 --> 00:07:35,049
She's cute.

177
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:36,809
That's the first time I like saw her face

178
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,801
kind of across the way, oh, I like her.

179
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:40,838
(nurse giggles)

180
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,180
- [Nurse] You'll keep her?

181
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,667
- Yeah.

182
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:47,380
- A new baby girl was
born into our family.

183
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,213
Isn't that exciting?

184
00:07:48,213 --> 00:07:49,127
- Yeah.

185
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,042
(squeals)

186
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:50,942
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna see some pictures?

187
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:51,775
- [All] Yeah!

188
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,758
- [Jeremy] Look at this!

189
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:55,564
- She's so cute!

190
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:57,926
- Her name is Janae.

191
00:07:57,926 --> 00:07:59,111
- Janae?

192
00:07:59,111 --> 00:07:59,944
- Janae.

193
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:00,777
- It's pretty.

194
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:01,610
- We like it.

195
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:05,360
- [Jeremy] Isaac, Elise,
Caleb, Laura, Janae.

196
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,272
- What do you think?

197
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:10,742
- I kind of like that?

198
00:08:10,742 --> 00:08:11,575
- You like it?

199
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:12,428
- It's cute!

200
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,625
- She's making funny faces at you guys.

201
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:14,782
(giggles)

202
00:08:14,782 --> 00:08:15,887
She says,

203
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:18,244
(grunts)

204
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:20,386
- Can she open her eyes?

205
00:08:20,386 --> 00:08:22,028
- She can open her eyes.

206
00:08:22,028 --> 00:08:23,397
- I wanna see her open her eyes.

207
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:24,935
- Oh, she's still like waking up?

208
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,975
- I think she is still waking up.

209
00:08:26,975 --> 00:08:29,353
Oh, I think she's trying to open her eyes.

210
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:30,657
- Hey Janae, aww!

211
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,107
- Hey Janae, aww!

212
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:33,107
- Hi, Janae.

213
00:08:35,004 --> 00:08:36,701
Are you tickling her little toes?

214
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:38,068
- Tick, ticka, ticka tick.

215
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:40,994
- [Elise] Her ears are so tiny.

216
00:08:40,995 --> 00:08:42,051
- Do you guys remember when you

217
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:43,563
felt her kicking inside of me?

218
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:47,181
These are her little feet
she was kicking us with!

219
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:49,651
- Now we can have her forever.

220
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:52,644
- We can, we can keep her forever.

221
00:08:52,644 --> 00:08:55,311
- [All] Happy birthday to Janae.

222
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,145
- I'm your big sister.

223
00:08:59,145 --> 00:09:01,202
- When's it my turn?

224
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,734
- [Jeremy] Pickles in the brownies?

225
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:03,567
(laughter)

226
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:04,987
- I did not put pickles in it.

227
00:09:04,987 --> 00:09:06,530
Kay, it's a new recipe so
I'm gonna want you guys

228
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,447
to all try it together.

229
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:10,442
- [Jeremy] Alright, have at it.

230
00:09:10,442 --> 00:09:12,030
- [Kendra] I'll take a bite too.

231
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,863
- Oh, my God.

232
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,869
- I can't eat it!

233
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:15,702
- Mmm.

234
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,499
- It's foam!

235
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:20,851
- [Jeremy] Take a bite!

236
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,109
- I'm surprised!

237
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:23,275
I'm surprised!

238
00:09:23,275 --> 00:09:24,391
I'm surprised!

239
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:26,100
I'm surprised!

240
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,962
- [Jeremy] So Kendra cut up there sponges

241
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:30,110
and then put chocolate frosting on them.

242
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,544
- [Caleb] Thank you
mom for giving us foam!

243
00:09:32,544 --> 00:09:34,948
- It's real chocolate frosting!

244
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:36,601
What do you think buddy?

245
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:39,038
- Well I can't eat it, but we can lick it.

246
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:41,705
(magical music)

247
00:09:44,969 --> 00:09:46,859
- [Jeremy] Are you girls
wearing matching dresses

248
00:09:46,859 --> 00:09:48,392
(giggles)
for Easter?

249
00:09:48,392 --> 00:09:49,396
- Come on!

250
00:09:49,396 --> 00:09:50,847
(shrieking)

251
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,863
- We're all in our church clothes

252
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:53,602
headed to church this Easter Sunday

253
00:09:53,602 --> 00:09:55,988
and before we left we had
a chance to take a picture

254
00:09:55,988 --> 00:09:58,254
of all the kids together
and I think we might of even

255
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:00,342
gotten a picture of all the kids smiling

256
00:10:00,342 --> 00:10:04,387
which would be a miracle,
and a little Easter gift.

257
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:08,054
(instrumental church music)

258
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:19,934
- [Announcer] On your marks!

259
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:20,934
Get set, go!

260
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:26,092
(playful instrumental music)

261
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,664
(cheering)

262
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,858
- [Jeremy] Good job Isaac, keep going!

263
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:35,675
- [Kendra] This is ages four to seven!

264
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:38,393
- [Announcer] Okay, on your marks!

265
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:39,393
Get set, go!

266
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:41,543
(playful instrumental music)

267
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,409
- [Kendra] Go go go!

268
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:44,393
(cheering)

269
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,504
- [Announcer] Come on everybody!

270
00:10:46,504 --> 00:10:48,582
- Here comes Caleb and Elise.

271
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:50,222
(clapping and cheering)

272
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,709
(loud cheering)

273
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:55,666
- [Jeremy] Good job Caleb!

274
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:57,964
Buddy you're a champion!

275
00:10:57,964 --> 00:10:59,444
Awesome Elise!

276
00:10:59,444 --> 00:11:00,816
You got one!

277
00:11:00,816 --> 00:11:01,851
You got a medal!

278
00:11:01,851 --> 00:11:03,835
- So you'd we've never
travel with a kid before.

279
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,065
Jeremy and I had such a hard time

280
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:07,337
with just like the car
seat, and the stroller,

281
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,583
and like one extra bag,

282
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,539
it makes me a little
nervous about traveling

283
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:10,656
with all five of them.

284
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:12,741
We're traveling, with
all five of our kids.

285
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:13,574
- [Jeremy] In two weeks.

286
00:11:13,574 --> 00:11:14,630
- Yeah!

287
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,297
(upbeat instrumental music)

288
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,100
Going on your first flight?

289
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:26,590
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

290
00:11:28,609 --> 00:11:31,721
- You say, will you marry me?

291
00:11:31,721 --> 00:11:32,904
That's what you say.

292
00:11:32,904 --> 00:11:35,906
- Brothers and sisters
can't marry each other.

293
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:36,739
- Yes!

294
00:11:38,258 --> 00:11:39,091
- No.

295
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,540
- We are all loaded up in the car

296
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,269
for our last day of school celebration

297
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:43,405
in our pajamas.

298
00:11:43,405 --> 00:11:45,386
We are going out to
breakfast in our pajamas

299
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,968
to one of our favorite
restaurants which is Ginger Sue's.

300
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:51,215
(playful guitar music)

301
00:11:51,215 --> 00:11:53,073
What do you think of your french toast?

302
00:11:53,073 --> 00:11:54,886
(playful guitar music)

303
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:56,505
Ooo getting some syrup?

304
00:11:56,505 --> 00:12:00,672
Jeremy and I ordered a veggie
scramble over potatoes.

305
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,444
Good morning, today is
Sunday here at the cabin,

306
00:12:04,444 --> 00:12:06,466
and we are headed to church
with my whole family.

307
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:07,855
I love that experience.

308
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,620
You know, we're enjoying
all of our cabin time

309
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,790
out in nature, and then
we get to get dressed

310
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,525
and go in and worship together.

311
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,598
Today's an especially
special Sunday for us

312
00:12:15,598 --> 00:12:18,249
because we're actually going
to be blessing baby Janae,

313
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:20,007
that's something that we've
done with each of our kids,

314
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,817
is we give them a special baby blessing,

315
00:12:21,817 --> 00:12:24,143
and they look so cute in
their little blessing gowns,

316
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:26,104
and we decided to do it
while we were here in Arizona

317
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,433
because my family's here and
so much of Jeremy's family

318
00:12:28,433 --> 00:12:29,512
also lives in the area,

319
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,556
so it's a special Sunday for us.

320
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:35,775
So my parents have created the
coolest play area out here.

321
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:38,442
(upbeat techno)

322
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,009
Good job Laura.

323
00:12:47,922 --> 00:12:49,005
Oh, so close!

324
00:12:49,955 --> 00:12:53,038
(upbeat party music)

325
00:12:58,671 --> 00:12:59,914
You wanna write the check?

326
00:12:59,914 --> 00:13:00,785
- Let's do it.

327
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,756
- [Kendra] Today is the last check.

328
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:05,152
- The last check to the bank.

329
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:07,171
We're grateful for the
ways that this world

330
00:13:07,171 --> 00:13:10,452
opened doors in the future
for other opportunities

331
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,535
for serving and doing
charities in other ways.

332
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:14,787
We really feel blessed.

333
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:16,404
- Well we've been having a
good discussion with the kids

334
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:18,110
about paying off our house,

335
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,777
and what that means and what a loan is,

336
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:22,123
and trying to teach them all
these complicated things.

337
00:13:22,123 --> 00:13:24,061
I'm excited that this house is ours,

338
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:25,658
and I'm really proud of Jeremy,

339
00:13:25,658 --> 00:13:28,664
he's worked really hard and
we're paying off our house.

340
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,176
- Say happy birthday mom.

341
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:31,712
- [Kendra] Hi!

342
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,324
- You made me this year!

343
00:13:33,324 --> 00:13:34,157
- [Kendra] Hi!

344
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:34,990
- Thank you!

345
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,225
- [Kendra] 33 was a good year.

346
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,911
- I cut my hair all by myself.

347
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:41,460
- [Kendra] Are little girls
supposed to cut their hair?

348
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,431
- All by ourselves you mean mama?

349
00:13:43,431 --> 00:13:45,603
- [Kendra] Yeah, are we supposed
to cut it all by ourselves?

350
00:13:45,603 --> 00:13:47,251
Why did you cut your hair?

351
00:13:47,251 --> 00:13:49,153
- Because I wanted to all by myself,

352
00:13:49,153 --> 00:13:50,932
cause I'm a big girl!

353
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:53,456
- [Jeremy] We have our little
cheering crowd over here.

354
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:55,552
(cheering)

355
00:13:55,552 --> 00:13:57,658
- Go Janae, go Janae!

356
00:13:57,658 --> 00:13:58,491
- Go Nae!

357
00:13:59,729 --> 00:14:00,562
- Go Nae!

358
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:01,395
- Go Nae!

359
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,419
- [Jeremy] She likes her little fan club.

360
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,720
They kinda scare her, a little bit.

361
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,895
Try to walk to me, whoa.

362
00:14:11,895 --> 00:14:13,746
She's like pushing off those legs?

363
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:15,769
- [Kendra] What!

364
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,725
This is craziness!

365
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:20,725
(upbeat electronic)

366
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:25,011
- [Jeremy] Let go!

367
00:14:25,011 --> 00:14:25,844
- Whoo!

368
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:30,812
(upbeat electronic)

369
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:37,706
(cheering)

370
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:42,943
(synchronized cheering)

371
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:55,504
- [Jeremy] You got me!

372
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:56,723
- Alright, thank you Emily.

373
00:14:56,723 --> 00:14:58,149
- [Jeremy] So one of Kendra's

374
00:14:58,149 --> 00:15:00,363
all time favorite things is kayaking.

375
00:15:00,363 --> 00:15:03,613
(calming guitar music)

376
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:08,244
- Hi!

377
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:14,018
- Did you hear that there
are snakes in the lake?

378
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:16,518
- [Jeremy] You doing it Laura?

379
00:15:19,332 --> 00:15:22,045
(magical instrumental music)

380
00:15:22,045 --> 00:15:23,859
- [Jeremy] Laura!

381
00:15:23,859 --> 00:15:25,108
Elise you swimmin'?

382
00:15:25,108 --> 00:15:26,173
- Yeah!

383
00:15:26,173 --> 00:15:28,340
(screams)

384
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:32,452
(splashes)

385
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:33,785
- [Jeremy] Whoa!

386
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:37,064
Yeah!

387
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,564
(loud cheers)

388
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:43,471
- [All] Two, three!

389
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:46,027
(cheering)

390
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:48,694
(magical music)

391
00:15:54,364 --> 00:15:56,905
- Everyone's getting theirs.

392
00:15:56,905 --> 00:15:58,039
- [Kendra] This is so cool.

393
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:00,529
- This is like a dream in Rapunzel.

394
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:03,696
(fireworks crackling)

395
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:08,049
(cheering)

396
00:16:08,049 --> 00:16:11,216
(fireworks whistling)

397
00:16:15,143 --> 00:16:16,701
- Look!

398
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:18,687
- Those are so pretty!

399
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,238
- Let me see if it's long
enough do you wanna donate it?

400
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:21,243
- Yeah.

401
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:24,368
I like doing services
and it makes me happy.

402
00:16:24,368 --> 00:16:26,168
(inspiring instrumental music)

403
00:16:26,168 --> 00:16:27,352
- [Kendra] There it is!

404
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,185
Thank you!

405
00:16:30,734 --> 00:16:32,746
What do you think?

406
00:16:32,746 --> 00:16:33,996
- I'm so happy.

407
00:16:41,327 --> 00:16:43,818
- [Kendra] Thank you.

408
00:16:43,818 --> 00:16:46,481
There it is, there's Elise's hair.

409
00:16:46,481 --> 00:16:48,285
- I love it!

410
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:49,891
- [Kendra] And you're done, just kidding.

411
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:50,942
(giggles)

412
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:54,079
(scanner beeping)

413
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,975
- It's a big event

414
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:56,733
when our family gets on a plane.

415
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:58,091
- [Agent] Thank you guys.

416
00:16:58,091 --> 00:16:59,603
- [Jeremy] Alright, let's go!

417
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,520
(triumphant music)

418
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,205
- They're pretty excited.

419
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:07,718
It actually went pretty well.

420
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:08,571
I was really nervous,

421
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:09,915
but when the kids came up,

422
00:17:09,915 --> 00:17:12,808
they just sparkled and shined.

423
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:14,358
- Someone asked Laura to sing,

424
00:17:14,358 --> 00:17:15,570
and although we didn't film it,

425
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,986
we had some friends who caught it,

426
00:17:16,987 --> 00:17:18,259
so you gotta check this out.

427
00:17:18,259 --> 00:17:21,736
(undiscernable singing)

428
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:25,069
(undiscernable singing)

429
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:43,268
- This could go on, forever,

430
00:17:43,268 --> 00:17:44,174
this could go on.

431
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,173
Big finish, a bow!

432
00:17:45,173 --> 00:17:46,874
Big finish, a bow!

433
00:17:46,874 --> 00:17:49,124
(cheering)

434
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:50,855
- How are you guys doing?

435
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:51,688
- [Both] Good.

436
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:53,791
- We're just seeing the office.

437
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,246
- Kay so the reason I
brought Isaac and Elise

438
00:17:56,246 --> 00:18:00,176
up here is because we
have a huge announcement.

439
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:01,176
Brent and I,

440
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:04,670
we're starting a law firm.

441
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:08,753
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!

442
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:09,644
- [Jeremy] You can hear everyone.

443
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:10,685
(cheering)

444
00:18:10,685 --> 00:18:11,857
Whoo hoo!

445
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:12,774
Look at it!

446
00:18:13,662 --> 00:18:14,934
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness!

447
00:18:14,934 --> 00:18:15,767
(cheering)

448
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:18,832
- [Jeremy] Do you see the corona?

449
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:21,074
- [Kendra] That is so cool!

450
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:24,155
Look it, Jeremy you got your sunspot.

451
00:18:24,155 --> 00:18:25,644
- [Caleb] I can't even see it!

452
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:28,385
- [Jeremy] Look at the sunset you guys.

453
00:18:28,385 --> 00:18:31,491
But the camera can't
pick up the experience.

454
00:18:31,491 --> 00:18:35,577
- Taking off the solar glasses
and see that is amazing.

455
00:18:35,577 --> 00:18:36,994
- Is that a star?

456
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:42,580
- It's so dark and it's
not even two o'clock!

457
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:45,021
It's moving!

458
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,094
It's moving!

459
00:18:46,094 --> 00:18:49,087
- [Kendra] Everybody,
everybody put on your glasses!

460
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,828
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it was just two minutes.

461
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:52,367
- [Kendra] Was that two minutes?

462
00:18:52,367 --> 00:18:54,329
That went by so fast!

463
00:18:54,329 --> 00:18:55,485
Say Kindergarten!

464
00:18:55,485 --> 00:18:56,735
- Kindergarten!

465
00:18:57,981 --> 00:18:59,314
Watch out world!

466
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,181
Watch out world.

467
00:19:02,181 --> 00:19:03,162
- [Jeremy] That was creepy.

468
00:19:03,162 --> 00:19:04,024
(Kendra laughs)

469
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,691
(smooth techno)

470
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,037
- Now we're going to try
to find the White House.

471
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:14,232
(presidential music)

472
00:19:14,232 --> 00:19:15,887
I don't know why I have to take a picture,

473
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,399
like there's a million pictures,

474
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:18,746
I could just look at the
picture, but it's cool

475
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:21,516
to be able to take the picture yourself.

476
00:19:21,516 --> 00:19:25,433
(national anthem instrumental)

477
00:19:26,762 --> 00:19:28,032
I think they're gonna have a great day.

478
00:19:28,032 --> 00:19:29,137
Isaac what's your first class?

479
00:19:29,137 --> 00:19:30,269
- Music.

480
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,102
- [Kendra] Music.

481
00:19:31,102 --> 00:19:31,935
Okay, is this it?

482
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:32,768
High five.

483
00:19:32,768 --> 00:19:36,539
- Bye bye Isaac, see you some other time.

484
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:37,539
- Bye Isaac.

485
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:43,071
- [Kendra] Are you excited
to meet new friends?

486
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:43,904
- Yeah.

487
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:46,571
- [Kendra] Where's your classroom?

488
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:47,578
- Right there.

489
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:48,632
- [Kendra] Good memory.

490
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:50,131
(chuckles)

491
00:19:50,131 --> 00:19:51,295
- So when it's time for lunch,
you'll come to your bag.

492
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:52,929
- That's my snack right there.

493
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,205
- [Kendra] What letter are
you learning about today?

494
00:19:56,205 --> 00:19:57,537
- Uh, A.

495
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,634
- [Kendra] The letter A.

496
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:00,791
- Cause that.

497
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,754
- [Kendra] Kay buddy, have a good day,

498
00:20:01,754 --> 00:20:03,868
can I have a hug before I go?

499
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:04,785
- Hi Laura.

500
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,810
- I'll miss you buddy,
have a good day, okay?

501
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,643
- Okay, bye.

502
00:20:12,643 --> 00:20:13,476
- Listen to your teacher.

503
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,916
So Janae was absolutely
screeching inside from the window,

504
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,795
like she wanted to be outside so badly,

505
00:20:17,795 --> 00:20:19,517
and so I brought her
little high chair out here

506
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:22,776
onto the deck and she's happy as can be.

507
00:20:22,776 --> 00:20:24,693
You watching everybody?

508
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:27,949
(laughter)

509
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:28,782
- Oh!

510
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:30,782
- [Kendra] Oh, so close!

511
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,518
- Oh!

512
00:20:33,518 --> 00:20:36,173
(cheering and screaming)

513
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:37,249
- Yay!

514
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:39,747
We won, three points.

515
00:20:39,747 --> 00:20:43,580
(sock hop instrumental music)

516
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,977
- I am a sticker girl, -irl,

517
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:50,714
- I am a sticker girl, -irl,

518
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:52,232
I am a sticker girl, hurl, girlll!

519
00:20:52,232 --> 00:20:55,065
I am a sticker girl, hurl, girlll!

520
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,178
Nose.

521
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,036
- Today might be the day,

522
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:01,923
like look at the subscriber button,

523
00:21:01,923 --> 00:21:04,172
we are almost at a million subscribers.

524
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:05,143
- It's unbelievable.

525
00:21:05,143 --> 00:21:06,115
- It really is.

526
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:06,948
- It's crazy.

527
00:21:06,948 --> 00:21:09,156
- And thank you, thank you
to every single one of you.

528
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,944
To celebrate hitting
one million subscribers,

529
00:21:11,944 --> 00:21:14,203
we wanted to do something
that we've never done before.

530
00:21:14,203 --> 00:21:17,139
- We're gonna do a service meet up.

531
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:18,511
- [Kendra] So check out this cute note

532
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,594
that got left on my door.

533
00:21:22,639 --> 00:21:24,276
Dear mom, I love you.

534
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:25,535
I know you're having a hard day.

535
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:27,132
I know that you're tired.

536
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:30,547
Love and kisses, your secret friend.

537
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:33,273
- You guys, it says smash me.

538
00:21:33,273 --> 00:21:35,379
- Your present's inside of there.

539
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:36,768
(triumphant music)

540
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,260
(cheering)

541
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,420
- That afternoon that my
dad was in the ambulance

542
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,832
on the way to the hospital

543
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:44,801
and that he was having a heart attack,

544
00:21:44,801 --> 00:21:47,173
and that is a text that
you never want to get.

545
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,013
- [Elise] Hey Papa!

546
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:49,940
- Hello!

547
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,989
- [Elise] Are you doing well?

548
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:52,822
Better?

549
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:54,506
- I think I'm doing better.

550
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,555
- [Elise] Good.

551
00:21:55,555 --> 00:21:56,715
- I was hurting a lot,

552
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,873
and now I think I'm doing a lot better.

553
00:21:58,873 --> 00:21:59,706
- [Elise] Good.

554
00:21:59,706 --> 00:22:01,244
- Thanks for your notes and cards.

555
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:02,335
Do you remember doing them?

556
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:03,191
- [Elise And Laura] Yeah!

557
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:04,858
- [Kendra] Do you guys know that Papa

558
00:22:04,858 --> 00:22:07,355
has lots of cords hooked
up to him right now.

559
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:08,661
- [All] No.

560
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,307
- [Kendra] They're behind
him do you wanna see?

561
00:22:10,307 --> 00:22:12,019
Well those things are monitoring his heart

562
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:13,644
on this monitor up here.

563
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:14,794
- How did your heart attack start?

564
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:17,637
- How did your heart attack start?

565
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:18,634
- [Papa] They call it plaque,

566
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,438
but it's like a little piece of skin,

567
00:22:20,438 --> 00:22:22,266
and then it makes so like a traffic jam,

568
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:23,714
nothing can get past it.

569
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:26,732
- Now for the annual J House Corn Race.

570
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:27,565
Goooo!

571
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:28,398
Goooo!

572
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:32,375
They're going, keep going.

573
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:36,240
(squeals)

574
00:22:43,332 --> 00:22:44,165
Go!

575
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,948
Introducing Moana of Montunui!

576
00:22:48,981 --> 00:22:50,143
- [Kendra] Strike a pose!

577
00:22:50,143 --> 00:22:51,642
- [Jeremy] Smile!

578
00:22:51,642 --> 00:22:54,809
(Hawaiian drum music)

579
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,346
- It's snowing.

580
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,179
- Snowing!

581
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,061
- [Kendra] Did you see it Laura?

582
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:02,894
- Yes.

583
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:03,803
- [Kendra] Is it cold out?

584
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:04,636
- Yeah.

585
00:23:04,636 --> 00:23:05,917
- [Kendra] Can I get you
to wear your jacket now?

586
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:06,750
Okay good.

587
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,531
(laughter)

588
00:23:09,531 --> 00:23:11,864
(chuckling)

589
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:19,138
Guys there's a line outside.

590
00:23:19,138 --> 00:23:20,538
- [Jeremy] I wanted to vlog you guys,

591
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:21,621
is that alright?

592
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:24,412
(cheering)

593
00:23:24,412 --> 00:23:25,995
Look at this, what!

594
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:29,400
(cheering and screaming)

595
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,848
What!

596
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:33,847
(upbeat techno)

597
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:36,514
(upbeat techno)

598
00:23:43,491 --> 00:23:45,596
(calming harp music)

599
00:23:45,596 --> 00:23:46,429
- [Isaac] Where do you wanna go?

600
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,179
- [Kendra] That way into the fog.

601
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:53,947
(calming piano)

602
00:23:53,947 --> 00:23:55,975
- [Jeremy] There they are.

603
00:23:55,975 --> 00:23:57,630
- Good job Caleb, I think you're

604
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,359
they kayaking man.

605
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,676
- [Jeremy] He's doing good, huh?

606
00:24:02,676 --> 00:24:03,782
How was it Caleb?

607
00:24:03,782 --> 00:24:04,615
- It was fun.

608
00:24:04,615 --> 00:24:06,357
Now I'm gonna go with Elise.

609
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:07,405
- Our entire trip,

610
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,679
(loud screaming)

611
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:11,512
is worth it.

612
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:13,041
This is a piece of it.

613
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:15,644
(triumphant inspirational music)

614
00:24:15,644 --> 00:24:19,727
(triumphant inspirational music)

615
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,108
- This is delicious.

616
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:36,942
- [Jeremy] It is good.

617
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,803
- [Kendra] Like show stopping good.

618
00:24:38,803 --> 00:24:40,770
- [Jeremy] Cranberry Salsa.

619
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,019
- It rips your taste buds.

620
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:44,051
(magical music)

621
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:46,046
- What did you get?

622
00:24:46,046 --> 00:24:46,939
What is it?

623
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:50,534
Those are so cute, are
those Christmas jammies?

624
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,479
- [Jeremy] Go put em on.

625
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:52,703
What do you think?

626
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:54,081
- I like it!

627
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:57,143
(train chugging)

628
00:24:57,143 --> 00:24:58,460
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae's coming.

629
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,793
She's loving it!

630
00:25:01,047 --> 00:25:02,845
- [Kendra] Nae Nae's in!

631
00:25:02,845 --> 00:25:04,794
(Christmas music)

632
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,067
(news music)

633
00:25:06,067 --> 00:25:06,900
- Oh yeah!

634
00:25:07,751 --> 00:25:09,811
(excited murmuring)

635
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:11,159
- We need a little--

636
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,659
(news music)

637
00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:15,439
- Now see some of the screens over here?

638
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,856
(news music)

639
00:25:21,445 --> 00:25:23,526
- Back to Elise for traffic.

640
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:25,167
- I'm so excited to see you again.

641
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:29,429
Um, the road is pretty
full and as you can see

642
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:32,917
there is a few car crashes
and the police have been

643
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:33,750
driving crazy with all the car crashes.

644
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:37,425
driving crazy with all the car crashes.

645
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:41,486
Now, as you can see,
they're all pretty good now.

646
00:25:41,486 --> 00:25:43,385
And now we'll go back to Caleb.

647
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,317
- We all welcome you all back

648
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:49,945
to the today's top story about
the Earth getting brighter.

649
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:50,949
(chuckles)

650
00:25:50,949 --> 00:25:53,616
(Jeremy laughs)

651
00:25:55,884 --> 00:25:57,120
(yelling and banging)

652
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,196
So why the Earth is getting brighter

653
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,872
is because all the builders.

654
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:03,102
is because all the builders.

655
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:05,769
(both laughing)

656
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:11,955
- [Jeremy] Cut!

657
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:12,872
And action!

658
00:26:14,258 --> 00:26:16,341
(laughter)

659
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,708
(giggling)

660
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:18,541
And--

661
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:22,178
Okay.

662
00:26:22,178 --> 00:26:23,293
- So why the--

663
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:25,960
(wild giggling)

664
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:28,448
Do it again.

665
00:26:28,448 --> 00:26:30,993
So why the Earth is getting brighter,

666
00:26:30,993 --> 00:26:31,993
is because--

667
00:26:33,811 --> 00:26:36,673
I'm gonna do this one pretty high.

668
00:26:36,673 --> 00:26:38,506
- Put mine right here.

669
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:41,691
(Christmas music)

670
00:26:41,691 --> 00:26:44,524
(Christmas music)

671
00:26:53,254 --> 00:26:54,495
- [Jeremy] You're tall enough

672
00:26:54,495 --> 00:26:55,968
to get em up there pretty tall.

673
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:56,970
- This looks like--

674
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,053
- Stick it up right here.

675
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:00,762
How's that look?

676
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:01,595
- Yay!

677
00:27:01,595 --> 00:27:02,647
(clapping)

678
00:27:02,647 --> 00:27:03,513
- We did it!

679
00:27:03,513 --> 00:27:04,846
- [Caleb] Yayyy!

680
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:08,064
- [Jeremy] It's cold out here.

681
00:27:08,064 --> 00:27:08,897
- She doesn't like the hat.

682
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:10,471
- [Jeremy] It's windy cold.

683
00:27:10,471 --> 00:27:11,693
- It was warm today, but there's

684
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:13,565
(baby cries)
a lot of wind coming in.

685
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,815
(chill country guitar)

686
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:21,552
Everybody's layered up
with a couple of jackets on

687
00:27:21,552 --> 00:27:23,139
a couple pairs of pants on,

688
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:25,251
and some hats, it's still kinda cold.

689
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:28,501
(chill country guitar)

690
00:27:39,733 --> 00:27:43,818
- Filming with Studio C, the
one billion views celebration,

691
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:45,870
we lost our camera.

692
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,785
It's so devastating, we had so much fun,

693
00:27:48,785 --> 00:27:51,015
and we filmed a bunch of stuff,

694
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:53,098
and that footage is gone.

695
00:27:54,592 --> 00:27:55,425
For now.

696
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,066
I'm still hoping like
shows up or turns up,

697
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,808
or somehow is found.

698
00:27:58,808 --> 00:27:59,796
Anyway, what happened was,

699
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:02,544
Kendra and I were doing this
peanut butter hair challenge.

700
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,526
- And go!

701
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:04,443
- [All] Oh!

702
00:28:10,162 --> 00:28:12,374
- Oh, looking good, looking good!

703
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:13,917
(Jeremy chuckles)

704
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:15,116
(baby cries)

705
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:16,172
- Yeah!

706
00:28:16,172 --> 00:28:17,313
(baby squeals)

707
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:20,280
- So the kids haven't seen
Janae's new trick yet.

708
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,113
Ready?

709
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:23,945
(laughter)

710
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,993
(cheering)

711
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:26,993
- [All] Yay!

712
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,392
(clapping and cheering)

713
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:35,889
(Christmas music)

714
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:38,722
(Christmas music)

715
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:41,089
- Is this one mine?

716
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,192
- [Jeremy] That's it.

717
00:28:42,192 --> 00:28:43,943
- A Babyboo?

718
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:45,028
- What!

719
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,072
Look Isaac!

720
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:46,917
- This!

721
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:47,750
My own crown!

722
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,583
My own crown!

723
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:51,666
(exciting crosstalk)

724
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,414
- Yeah!

725
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:55,824
- [Kendra] It's to play with your kitchen.

726
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:57,545
You get to make pretend cookies for us.

727
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:59,723
- Mom, thank you!

728
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:02,670
(kissing noises)

729
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,861
- Mmmm.

730
00:29:03,861 --> 00:29:04,694
- What!

731
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:08,267
Cranium Jesus.

732
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:09,100
Cranium Jesus.

733
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,210
- Geodes.

734
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:11,627
So you're gonna take rocks,

735
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,509
and then you're gonna
use this, what's that?

736
00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:14,403
- Hammer.

737
00:29:14,403 --> 00:29:16,073
- And you're gonna break the rocks open

738
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:17,304
and see what's inside.

739
00:29:17,304 --> 00:29:18,137
- Grr.

740
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:20,189
You're tackling me!

You're welcome buddy!

742
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,965
- Thank you daddy.

743
00:29:23,965 --> 00:29:25,527
- You're welcome bud.

744
00:29:25,527 --> 00:29:26,527
Let's do it.

745
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:31,248
- This is my favorite present
to give to little babies.

746
00:29:31,248 --> 00:29:33,165
Kay, now pull this way.

747
00:29:34,834 --> 00:29:36,224
- [Jeremy] Ooo.

748
00:29:36,224 --> 00:29:37,057
Oh.

750
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:43,354
(kids laughing)

751
00:29:43,354 --> 00:29:44,539
Best gift ever.

752
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,789
(laughter)

753
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,640
Yay!

754
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,330
(all clapping)

755
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,099
- [Laura] Goodnight, J House out.

756
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,512
- [Kendra] Cause Christmas is over.

757
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:58,345

758
00:29:59,293 --> 00:30:00,989
- [Jeremy] Oy!

759
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:02,557
Ow!

760
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:04,117
She's doing it.

761
00:30:04,117 --> 00:30:06,459
She wants to get out and play in the snow!

762
00:30:06,459 --> 00:00:00,000
