1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:02,672
- So it's Monday morning

2
00:00:02,672 --> 00:00:05,324
and it's been a rough Monday morning.

3
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:08,724
We're recovering from
the family being sick

4
00:00:08,724 --> 00:00:11,818
and we've had several
tantrums this morning.

5
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:12,810
We're trying to get things going.

6
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,708
I've got to head off to work

7
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,434
and I think we're just
feeling kind of like weak

8
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:22,034
and Monday's winning so far,
but we hope to catch up.

9
00:00:22,034 --> 00:00:26,201
("Dance of the Sugar Plum
Fairy from The Nutcracker")

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,410
- We all know my favorite way
to get rid of a bad Monday

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,805
is to dance it off

12
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:36,547
and I love that I was dancing
and then I got out the camera

13
00:00:36,547 --> 00:00:38,757
and no matter what I do,

14
00:00:38,757 --> 00:00:40,281
they're just doing that.

15
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,225
Like, they don't even notice.

16
00:00:42,225 --> 00:00:43,058
They don't even care.

17
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:45,412
They're like, "Crazy Mom is at it again."

18
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:49,872
Anyway, I've got to dance
off some steam this morning.

19
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:51,483
Gotta kick Monday's butt.

20
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:52,544
That's what I gotta do.

21
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:56,711
("All I Want For Christmas
Is You" by Mariah Carey)

22
00:00:59,413 --> 00:01:01,246
♫ You

23
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:05,948
♫ Baby

24
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:12,326
♫ Baby

25
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,657
("Little Drummer Boy")

26
00:01:31,183 --> 00:01:32,876
After several days of sickness,

27
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:36,128
I am so sick of cartoons
on the TV being on

28
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,214
and so I was determined today, no TV,

29
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:41,707
but honestly I'm still not
feeling back to normal.

30
00:01:41,707 --> 00:01:44,040
Laura's super cranky and Caleb won't nap.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,496
So I'm letting them have one show

32
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,154
and I'm choosing not to
feel guilty about it.

33
00:01:48,154 --> 00:01:50,863
They're watching "How The
Grinch Stole Christmas."

34
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:53,834
- I want to watch The Cat in the Hat one

35
00:01:53,834 --> 00:01:56,032
when this one is done.

36
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:56,865
- [Kendra] Nope.

37
00:01:56,865 --> 00:01:57,848
We're just watchin' one today.

38
00:01:57,848 --> 00:02:00,126
- But I want The Cat in the Hat one

39
00:02:00,126 --> 00:02:02,595
because I like The Cat in the Hat.

40
00:02:02,595 --> 00:02:04,348
- And that's how that's going,

41
00:02:04,348 --> 00:02:06,454
but I wanted to show you
guys what Isaac was up to.

42
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:09,757
He is reading a book, a
biography of Walt Disney

43
00:02:09,757 --> 00:02:12,445
and so I turned around and
this is what he's up to.

44
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,862
- He was a artist so he colored the stuff

45
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:22,162
for the movies, so I'm wanting to do it.

46
00:02:22,162 --> 00:02:23,523
- [Kendra] So he wants to be an artist

47
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:26,028
and so he's creating
pictures to make into movies.

48
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,914
What's your movie gonna be about?

49
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,659
- The haunted house.

50
00:02:29,659 --> 00:02:31,926
- Laura is totally becoming a human,

51
00:02:31,926 --> 00:02:35,672
as in an interactive part
of our playing experience.

52
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:36,877
She's getting into things

53
00:02:36,877 --> 00:02:38,901
which is an adjustment for the kids

54
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:41,447
and the kids are actually
playing with her more.

55
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:42,987
It's really cute.

56
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:45,817
(toy siren)

57
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,317
(piano music)

58
00:02:55,588 --> 00:02:57,671
(crying)

59
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,293
- Caleb, I need you to share with Laura.

60
00:03:04,344 --> 00:03:06,315
Caleb, let's share with Laura.

61
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:08,815
(piano music)

62
00:03:16,355 --> 00:03:17,678
Caleb, be so soft to her.

63
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:21,637
- But Laura gonna bonk into these bumps.

64
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:25,009
- You don't want her to go in those spots?

65
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,176
(mumbles)

66
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:34,462
So Caleb went down for
a nap, a super late nap

67
00:03:34,462 --> 00:03:36,072
which I may regret later,

68
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:37,907
but I'm really grateful for at the moment.

69
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:40,283
Isaac and Elise are playing
downstairs in the basement

70
00:03:40,283 --> 00:03:42,246
which is a complete wreck.

71
00:03:42,246 --> 00:03:44,252
Like it's a disaster zone down there,

72
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,622
so I'm just letting
them play at the moment

73
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:50,189
because I am getting one-on-one
time with little Laura.

74
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:52,522
So, I'm ignoring my laundry.

75
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,796
I am ignoring the fact that I have no idea

76
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:57,829
what we're doing for dinner

77
00:03:57,829 --> 00:03:59,565
and I'm ignoring my dirty kitchen

78
00:03:59,565 --> 00:04:01,619
because I want to play with my baby.

79
00:04:01,619 --> 00:04:04,118
She is growing up so fast.

80
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,368
So here we are.

81
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,872
Let's play, huh?

82
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:09,854
- Dah.

83
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:10,687
- Dah?

84
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:13,465
Oh, you are precious.

85
00:04:15,952 --> 00:04:18,697
Oh, you want to sit on my lap?

86
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:20,607
You want to sit right here by me?

87
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,774
(tapping)

88
00:04:27,396 --> 00:04:30,396
(mumbling)

89
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:32,085
Oh, you gonna stand up?

90
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,167
You gonna stand up?

91
00:04:34,167 --> 00:04:35,417
Oh my goodness.

92
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:38,419
Oh my goodness.

93
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,760
Oh, look at you.

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,954
So, we are headed into
Elise's parent watch day

95
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:46,870
at her ballet class.

96
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,587
- [Teacher] So you have
to put your legs very...

97
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:52,585
Melts like you're a snowball who's melting

98
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:54,335
and sit up very tall.

99
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,422
Now, turn to the side.

100
00:04:59,668 --> 00:05:01,896
Yeah, good ladies.

101
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:02,729
Toes.

102
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,028
Alright.

103
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,194
Sit back on your knees for...

104
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:08,429
Turn the corner, Elise.

105
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:09,608
Good.

106
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:10,719
Backwards.

107
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:12,103
Keep comin' all the way to me.

108
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,342
Up to the top of your point.

109
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:15,492
Close first.

110
00:05:15,492 --> 00:05:17,409
I love your legs today.

111
00:05:18,291 --> 00:05:20,136
Up to the top.

112
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,629
And close together.

113
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:23,422
Now this foot we're going
to put our heel down.

114
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:24,255
And jump.

115
00:05:25,256 --> 00:05:28,163
And land, but you still have to jump.

116
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:29,729
Plie.

117
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:30,562
Jump.

118
00:05:32,474 --> 00:05:34,724
(clapping)

119
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:38,709
Nice job.

120
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,140
Front.

121
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,973
Open side.

122
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,182
Point to the side.

123
00:05:43,182 --> 00:05:44,656
Tuck your toes.

124
00:05:44,656 --> 00:05:45,573
And curtsy.

125
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:47,652
Close first.

126
00:05:47,652 --> 00:05:49,314
- [Kendra] Lise-ee, how was your class?

127
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:50,938
- It's fun.

128
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:51,771
- [Kendra] It's fun.

129
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,086
What's your favorite part?

130
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:54,340
- All of it.

131
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,895
- [Kendra] Are you being silly?

132
00:05:55,895 --> 00:05:57,531
Did a Google Live hangout tonight

133
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,152
with some vlogging friends.

134
00:05:59,152 --> 00:05:59,985
Super fun.

135
00:06:02,619 --> 00:06:03,804
- Yeah.

136
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,700
It's a lot of nice people
that we like to hang out with.

137
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,490
They're all vlogging right now too.

138
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,090
We're a bunch of weirdos.

139
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,241
- But we're all weird
together and that's nice.

140
00:06:13,241 --> 00:06:15,991
(keyboard music)

141
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:24,877
- [Isaac] The haunted house

142
00:06:24,877 --> 00:06:26,362
by Isaac.

143
00:06:26,362 --> 00:06:29,779
Once upon a time, in Kansas and Missouri,

144
00:06:31,087 --> 00:06:35,087
there was a mysterious
house that one day a year

145
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:38,548
there would be a haunted day.

146
00:06:38,548 --> 00:06:41,818
Their names were Ella, Michael,

147
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,985
Abbey, Walter, and Jordan.

148
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,923
Out of nowhere ghosts and bats appeared.

149
00:06:50,098 --> 00:00:00,000
To be continued.
