00:00:00,348 --> 00:00:01,818
- Hey, this is Kendra from J House,

2
00:00:01,818 --> 00:00:02,890
and I am going to show you guys

3
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,374
how to make candy parachutes.

4
00:00:04,374 --> 00:00:06,497
The kids have been very excited about it.

5
00:00:06,497 --> 00:00:10,214
And what I liked about this
activity is it's not very messy,

6
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:12,305
it's super quick and
easy, and it uses stuff

7
00:00:12,305 --> 00:00:13,978
that I already had around the house.

8
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:17,739
So, you need string, or, in
my case, I'm just using yarn,

9
00:00:17,739 --> 00:00:19,632
'cause that's what I had.

10
00:00:19,632 --> 00:00:23,132
You'll also need some tape, some scissors,

11
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:26,322
and you'll need tissue
paper, the kind, like,

12
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:27,546
with gift wrapping.

13
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:29,958
At first, I thought it meant,
like, Kleenexes tissues,

14
00:00:29,958 --> 00:00:31,738
but those wouldn't be
big enough, so you want

15
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:35,171
the full size sheets of tissue paper.

16
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:37,139
And, of course, you need candy.

17
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:39,952
I bought the mini size,
and that does work,

18
00:00:39,952 --> 00:00:42,832
but I think the fun size
would be more better,

19
00:00:42,832 --> 00:00:44,411
and be even more fun.

20
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,081
This activity was inspired by this book,

21
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,265
Christmas from Heaven, and
I'm gonna tell you more

22
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:50,298
about that in a minute.

23
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,918
Here's how you make them.

24
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:54,120
You just take your full
sheet of tissue paper,

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,688
it's 24 inches by 24 inches,

26
00:00:56,688 --> 00:01:00,438
and then, you need about
48 inches of string.

27
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:02,897
And, so, one,

28
00:01:03,978 --> 00:01:05,945
two, three, four.

29
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:07,291
Close enough.

30
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,976
What matters is that the
string is the same length,

31
00:01:09,976 --> 00:01:13,143
so then, I'm just going to match that.

32
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,232
So you've got your two
strings of the same length.

33
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:21,106
Now you're going to use the tape.

34
00:01:21,106 --> 00:01:23,261
Isaac, can you grab me the tape?

35
00:01:23,261 --> 00:01:27,944
And you're going to tape
it to the opposite edges,

36
00:01:27,944 --> 00:01:29,611
like this.

37
00:01:30,764 --> 00:01:32,764
Okay.

38
00:01:34,538 --> 00:01:38,705
So you're going to tape it to
the opposite edges, like this.

39
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:50,150
Okay, now I'm gonna do the other one.

40
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:58,433
Alright, now that I've
got all four edges taped

41
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:02,893
you pull it up together
in the center, like this,

42
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:07,060
and you tie just a regular knot.

43
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,027
Like, just a regular, old knot.

44
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:15,861
And the candy is gonna go in this part,

45
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:18,611
the little loop that's left over.

46
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,600
Got it?

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,183
And now you have...

48
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,266
a candy parachute!

49
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:35,150
Good job!

50
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:38,470
Okay, now we're gonna match
it up so it's the same length.

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,799
- I'll put it right here.

52
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,085
- Okay, get another one.

53
00:02:41,085 --> 00:02:44,335
She chose the Twix, she's a smart girl.

54
00:02:46,726 --> 00:02:48,309
Cut it right there.

55
00:02:50,779 --> 00:02:51,675
Very nice.

56
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:54,075
(Caleb laughs)

57
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:56,308
Now we're gonna put the tape on.

58
00:02:56,308 --> 00:03:00,475
Okay, I need you to get
me a little piece of tape.

59
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:02,390
Good work!

60
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,646
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas")

61
00:03:19,054 --> 00:03:21,204
The idea comes from this book.

62
00:03:21,204 --> 00:03:22,871
Oh! That's the back.

63
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:27,418
Okay, this book, Christmas from Heaven,

64
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:31,003
the true story of the Berlin candy bomber.

65
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,412
It tells the story of Gail Halvorsen,

66
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,969
who was a pilot after World War Two.

67
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,405
He was flying needed supplies
into the Berlin area,

68
00:03:39,405 --> 00:03:42,466
like flour, and just stuff
that they needed to survive,

69
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:45,220
and it was then that he
noticed the children there,

70
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,092
and the war-torn city
that they were living in.

71
00:03:48,092 --> 00:03:49,564
And the children had nothing,

72
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:51,654
and he just wanted to give them something.

73
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:54,101
So he got his buddies
together, and they pooled

74
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,813
their candy rations, they
tied them to parachutes,

75
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:59,019
and they dropped them from the airplanes

76
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:00,814
as they were flying overhead.

77
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:04,105
Anyway, the idea caught
on, and by Christmas,

78
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:07,853
people in America had
donated 21 tons of candy,

79
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:11,191
that were then tied to
parachutes, and dropped down

80
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:12,939
onto Berlin.

81
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,190
I love this story.

82
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,620
I'm a sucker for
non-fiction picture books,

83
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,058
and I love a story that ties
in history, and geography,

84
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:23,709
and compassion, and
just, true life heroes.

85
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,502
The kids love the book,
I highly recommend it.

86
00:04:25,502 --> 00:04:27,781
And in the back it gave
instructions for how to make

87
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:30,503
your own candy parachutes, so
we just knew we had to try it.

88
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,538
Thanks for watching my
crafty collab video.

89
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,846
This is a collaboration with
other YouTube mommy meetup

90
00:04:35,846 --> 00:04:38,856
mommies, and so, in the links
below you'll find the links

91
00:04:38,856 --> 00:04:40,322
to all of their channels.

92
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,987
There is going to be a
Christmas craft posted every day

93
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:45,899
from now until Christmas, so
go ahead and check 'em out.

94
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:47,649
Thanks! Bye!
