1
00:00:00,241 --> 00:00:02,722
- So we're in the room and Kendra said.

2
00:00:02,722 --> 00:00:05,820
- Uh oh, my internal
Caleb meter went off, run!

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,107
- Yeah, we have an uh-oh meter, like,

4
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:10,109
"Oh we've been talking
for three minutes together

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,614
"and we don't know where Caleb is."

6
00:00:12,614 --> 00:00:14,781
I can hear him, let's see.

7
00:00:16,366 --> 00:00:18,533
Buddy, what are you doing?

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,760
- I'm making some paint.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,037
- [Jeremy] You're making paint?

10
00:00:23,037 --> 00:00:24,204
- Yeah.
- How?

11
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,568
- Putting some soap in toothpaste.

12
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,620
- [Jeremy] You cleaning
up the counters in here?

13
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,484
- Yeah.

14
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,593
- [Jeremy] I'm just glad
that the toothbrushes

15
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:35,510
are all on the counter.

16
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,809
Do you wanna come do something else now?

17
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:40,642
- No.

18
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:43,674
But I'm still painting.

19
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:48,496
- [Jeremy] Do you need to
help us clean up the paint?

20
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:49,329
- No.

21
00:00:50,953 --> 00:00:53,703
(cheerful music)

22
00:01:17,835 --> 00:01:19,292
- [Kendra] Caleb, what happened?

23
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:22,783
- I wanted to say goodbye to daddy.

24
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,321
- [Kendra] You wanted
to say goodbye to daddy?

25
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,154
- Yeah.

26
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:28,248
- Jeremy was leaving for
work and Caleb was standing

27
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:31,103
in the window waving
and jumping and smiling

28
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,619
and screaming, "Dad, Dad, bye Dad!"

29
00:01:33,619 --> 00:01:35,793
And Jeremy was driving away and in his car

30
00:01:35,793 --> 00:01:39,052
and didn't hear him and so
Caleb was a little crushed.

31
00:01:39,052 --> 00:01:41,678
So now he has the best daddy in the world,

32
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:44,845
who just came back, who just came back

33
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:53,005
from the end of the street to
wave goodbye to his kiddos.

34
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:53,838
- [Jeremy] I love you, buddy!

35
00:01:53,838 --> 00:01:54,838
- Bye.
- Bye.

36
00:01:56,358 --> 00:01:58,152
- [Jeremy] You guys have
a good day, alright?

37
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:58,985
- Okay.
- Thanks.

38
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:00,483
- Good to see you.
- Say, "Bye, Dad!"

39
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:01,524
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad.

40
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:02,357
- [Jeremy] Love you.

41
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,052
- [Elise] See you at the pumpkin patch!

42
00:02:04,052 --> 00:02:05,213
- [Jeremy] See you at the pumpkin patch!

43
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:06,931
- [Kendra] Wave your hands real big!

44
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:10,774
- [Caleb] Bye, see you
at the pumpkin patch.

45
00:02:10,774 --> 00:02:12,348
- So we're on our way to the pumpkin patch

46
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:14,558
and we were just at a
stoplight and as we were parked

47
00:02:14,558 --> 00:02:19,257
at the stoplight, an ambulance
and a firetruck and everybody

48
00:02:19,257 --> 00:02:23,268
came by with their sirens on
and we tried to pull over,

49
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,870
but it's really hard when
you're at a stoplight.

50
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,004
Anyway, every time that
happens, I get emotional

51
00:02:29,004 --> 00:02:33,171
and I cry every time I see
sirens or hear sirens, I cry.

52
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,814
- And I make fun of her every time.

53
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,614
- I don't know why, but I
do remember the first time

54
00:02:39,614 --> 00:02:41,293
it happened and the first time it happened

55
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,128
was when I was pregnant
with Caleb and I was driving

56
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:46,050
somewhere with Isaac and
Elise and the same situation

57
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,268
happened where the sirens
came by and we pulled over

58
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,028
and Isaac asked, "Mom,
why do we pull over?"

59
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:52,802
And I started explaining, and I was like,

60
00:02:52,802 --> 00:02:55,679
"Well, Isaac" and I got
all emotional, I was like,

61
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:58,074
"We're a community and we love each other

62
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:01,419
"and we care about each
other and these ambulance,

63
00:03:01,419 --> 00:03:03,019
"they're going to somebody
who needs them, and they need

64
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,382
"them fast and so we all
have to get out of the way

65
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:07,675
"so that they can get
to where they need to go

66
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:09,964
"because we care about each other."

67
00:03:09,964 --> 00:03:12,718
And I started crying and
of course, I was pregnant

68
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:14,447
at the time, so I had a great excuse.

69
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:17,086
- We blamed it on the pregnancy, but now

70
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:19,676
there's no pregnancy, well wait a minute,

71
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:20,967
is this a pregnancy announcement?

72
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:25,868
- No, so every time now I
see them and I pull over,

73
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:28,959
I just remember that experience
and I get overwhelmed

74
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,472
with emotions of, I don't know,

75
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:34,515
what would you call those emotions?

76
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:36,494
- Emotional?
- Craziness, maybe?

77
00:03:36,494 --> 00:03:39,886
- No, is it empathy or gratitude

78
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,667
for the community, part of it?

79
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,486
- It's this feeling of
caring about the people

80
00:03:44,486 --> 00:03:46,305
they're headed to and
just wanting to make sure

81
00:03:46,305 --> 00:03:48,275
they're gonna be okay and so happy

82
00:03:48,275 --> 00:03:52,880
that our whole community
follows the rules and, anyway,

83
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,006
I'm gonna turn this off
before I start crying again.

84
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:57,242
I really like ambulances.

85
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:59,501
It's free to get into
the pumpkin patch today

86
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:02,769
and it's because we're bringing
donations for harvesters.

87
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:05,459
(gentle music)

88
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:06,586
- [Man] Thanks so much.

89
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:10,586
- [Kendra] There you go,
put 'em in there, guys.

90
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:21,379
(laughs)

91
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:24,379
- Whoa, you got it out of your hand!

92
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:28,943
(cheering)

93
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:36,855
(laughs)

94
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,597
- On a hay ride.
- Yeah.

95
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,511
This is fun!

96
00:04:54,714 --> 00:04:56,851
- [Jeremy] Did you find a pumpkin?

97
00:04:56,851 --> 00:04:58,234
You like it?

98
00:04:58,234 --> 00:04:59,848
- Can you hold it?

99
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:02,515
- Is it heavy?
- Is it too heavy?

100
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,030
- So I'm watching the World Series,

101
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,466
and it's looking much better tonight.

102
00:05:10,466 --> 00:05:12,730
We're in the bottom of the
sixth inning, it's three to two,

103
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:17,056
we have runners on second and
third, Perez is up to bat.

104
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:18,639
This is a big deal.

105
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:21,555
Oh, base hit, base hit!

106
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,813
Boom, that's two more runs!

107
00:05:24,813 --> 00:05:26,896
(laughs)

108
00:05:28,014 --> 00:05:29,521
He's gonna get to second,
too, it'll be a double,

109
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:33,294
so we can score again or I
think we only have one out.

110
00:05:33,294 --> 00:05:37,205
Alright, I think we're gonna win this one.

111
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:38,872
Five to two, Royals!

112
00:05:39,753 --> 00:00:00,000
(gentle music)
