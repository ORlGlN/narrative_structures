1
00:00:00,107 --> 00:00:03,164
- [Kendra] Alright,
lazy mom cooking today.

2
00:00:03,164 --> 00:00:04,715
We're making sugar cookies.

3
00:00:04,715 --> 00:00:07,169
And we are rolling it out
and patting it out and

4
00:00:07,169 --> 00:00:08,475
we are gonna get ready to cut it out.

5
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,004
Caleb, what shape do you wanna cut out?

6
00:00:11,004 --> 00:00:11,837
- Um...

7
00:00:14,496 --> 00:00:15,500
A pumpkin.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,053
- [Kendra] Ooh, you're gonna do a pumpkin?

9
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:20,277
- It's a heart so I can love everybody.

10
00:00:20,277 --> 00:00:24,354
Because there's a friend
that had a baby and we are

11
00:00:24,354 --> 00:00:28,670
making cookies for them and
I want it to have a heart.

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,974
- [Kendra] Oh, that's so sweet!

13
00:00:29,974 --> 00:00:31,644
Isaac, what shape are you gonna do?

14
00:00:31,644 --> 00:00:34,497
- I'm gonna do a football
because it's football season.

15
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:35,515
- [Kendra] She wrote it herself.

16
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:39,333
"I love looking at your
new baby, from Elise"

17
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,500
(upbeat string music)

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,910
- [Kendra] What's going on, Laura?

19
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,507
(children giggling)

20
00:01:12,507 --> 00:01:16,674
So she totally just climbed
over that bar somehow.

21
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,918
It was so funny to look
over and she was dangling.

22
00:01:20,918 --> 00:01:24,306
She couldn't touch on either
side and I ran for the camera.

23
00:01:24,306 --> 00:01:27,439
I just decided to shower and get ready.

24
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,599
And uh...

25
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:29,606
Hair fail!

26
00:01:29,606 --> 00:01:30,733
Am I right?

27
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:31,825
(Laura cries)

28
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,866
I know!

29
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,353
- [Jeremy] She's pretty sad about it.

30
00:01:34,353 --> 00:01:36,678
- [Kendra] I come out and
Jeremy's just looking at me like,

31
00:01:36,678 --> 00:01:37,845
what happened?

32
00:01:37,845 --> 00:01:38,736
- [Jeremy] It looks great!

33
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:40,512
(laughs)

34
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:43,905
- [Kendra] I diffused
it with sea salt spray.

35
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:44,738
I don't know what happened but...

36
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:47,085
- [Jeremy] Something happened.

37
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,887
- Something happened.

38
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:50,481
We're gonna have to fix that.

39
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:53,177
- We're going for the
wild and crazy foofy look.

40
00:01:53,177 --> 00:01:55,091
- [Kendra] Lioness, rawr!

41
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:57,801
What do you guys think of my hair?

42
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,342
- Crazy!

43
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:01,899
- It looks crazy but still nice.

44
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:03,318
- [Kendra and Jeremy] Awww.

45
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:04,550
- [Kendra] What a nice boy!

46
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,939
What do you think?

47
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,327
- [Elise] Crazy and funny!

48
00:02:08,327 --> 00:02:10,945
- [Kendra] Wow, your voice
sounds just like Elise!

49
00:02:10,945 --> 00:02:12,085
- [Elise] Oh, yeah.

50
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:13,392
Yeah, mom.

51
00:02:13,392 --> 00:02:15,782
I think you look good.

52
00:02:15,782 --> 00:02:18,411
- What do you want to say
about your sister Elise?

53
00:02:18,411 --> 00:02:20,011
- [Elise] I love her and I kiss her.

54
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:21,975
(Jeremy chuckles)

55
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,566
And I tickle her!

56
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:26,376
- [Kendra] Why are you
chewing on your thumb, Laura?

57
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,496
- [Elise] Because I like to.

58
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:29,966
- [Jeremy] What about your brother Caleb?

59
00:02:29,966 --> 00:02:31,268
What do you think about him?

60
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,247
- [Elise] He stinks!

61
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:35,868
- Is it so bad, should I just
go jump back in the shower?

62
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,177
Am I just done?

63
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:38,526
- No, I have to go back to work.

64
00:02:38,526 --> 00:02:39,700
You can't jump in the shower.

65
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,559
It looks good.

66
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,731
This is like when it's time
to go and we're late and

67
00:02:42,731 --> 00:02:44,129
they put on something and
you don't even look and

68
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:46,216
you're like, it looks good, let's go!

69
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:48,864
- Alright, so we're
running late somewhere.

70
00:02:48,864 --> 00:02:52,330
But I had to come back in
the house to get duct tape.

71
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,224
Caleb has learned to undo
his car seat buckle and

72
00:02:55,224 --> 00:02:56,407
he won't stay in his car seat.

73
00:02:56,407 --> 00:02:58,024
I don't know what to do about it.

74
00:02:58,024 --> 00:03:01,819
So I'm going to try duct
taping my child's belt shut.

75
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,657
So hopefully he can't get it open.

76
00:03:03,657 --> 00:03:05,124
I'm at a complete loss.

77
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,802
I have to go somewhere and I can't have

78
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:09,422
a two-year-old just running around my car.

79
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,505
So I buckled just around there.

80
00:03:12,505 --> 00:03:16,340
I don't know, that can't be
safe in case of an emergency.

81
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:18,302
But what are you supposed
to do when your child

82
00:03:18,302 --> 00:03:21,073
won't stay in the car seat?

83
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:23,804
He took the duct tape off his buckle

84
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,409
and put it on his mouth.

85
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:28,732
- [Elise] And he was unbuckled.

86
00:03:28,732 --> 00:03:30,815
- And he unbuckled again.

87
00:03:35,212 --> 00:03:36,129
Speechless.

88
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:41,595
So I just had a really
sweet moment with Lisie-Loo.

89
00:03:41,595 --> 00:03:45,075
I went to a women's meeting
at church tonight and

90
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:48,728
I tend to get really shy before
those kinds of meetings and

91
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,422
I just get kind of nervous.

92
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:55,089
And I came home and I
told Elise that I felt

93
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,709
a little bit shy at the meeting.

94
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,584
And she was so sweet and
she held me in her arms and

95
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:05,271
she gave me a big hug and she said,

96
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:08,326
"Mom, let me tell you about
a time when I felt shy."

97
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,913
And then she told me
about a time when she was

98
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:12,811
shy the first time and
then she tried again and

99
00:04:12,811 --> 00:04:14,558
she felt better the second time.

100
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:17,367
So then she told me, "Mom,
you'll just have to try again

101
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,812
and maybe next time it will be better."

102
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:22,298
And then she asked me
if I met any friends.

103
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:26,189
This is a really tender
motherhood moment for me because

104
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:29,225
I feel like so often as a mom,
I don't know what I'm doing

105
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,183
and I'm just trying and
sometimes I feel like

106
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:35,113
everything's failing and
it's all falling apart.

107
00:04:35,113 --> 00:04:37,481
And I feel like this was
one of those nights where

108
00:04:37,481 --> 00:04:41,700
there was this little glimmer
that something is working.

109
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,443
I guess it felt really good to feel like

110
00:04:44,443 --> 00:04:46,957
all those times of trying
to validate and understand

111
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:49,079
and share experiences
with her when she's having

112
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,010
a hard time, that when she
saw me having a hard time,

113
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:56,105
that was her first thought
was to try to comfort me by

114
00:04:56,105 --> 00:04:58,838
validating and connecting with me

115
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:01,121
and I just love this little goober.

116
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,281
This little girlie is
one of my best friends.

117
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:04,198
I love her.

118
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:09,632
(silly creaking noise)

119
00:05:09,632 --> 00:00:00,000
(bouncy string music)
