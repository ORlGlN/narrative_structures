1
00:00:00,775 --> 00:00:02,942
- [Jeremy] Take a step.

2
00:00:02,942 --> 00:00:05,228
(Children cheering)

3
00:00:05,228 --> 00:00:06,728
Separate them out.

4
00:00:08,118 --> 00:00:10,304
- This pillow is perfect for me.

5
00:00:10,304 --> 00:00:12,471
- Look, they have cookies!

6
00:00:14,284 --> 00:00:16,140
- Well, I'm headed to
workout group this morning,

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,714
and I don't want to go at all.

8
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:19,103
My body does not want to move.

9
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,901
It does not want to exercise, but I know

10
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:22,544
on the other side of it,
I'm going to feel better.

11
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:25,225
So, off to workout group.

12
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:29,190
- Ja doesn't like taking naps anymore.

13
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,107
She'd rather just hang
out, but she's so tired.

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:36,714
(Kissing sound)

15
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:40,047
(Soothing guitar music)

16
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,208
She's all smiley.

17
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:48,098
Look at her; she's so happy.

18
00:00:48,098 --> 00:00:49,925
(Kissing sound)

19
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:52,047
You want to sing her to sleep?

20
00:00:52,047 --> 00:00:55,464
- Said the night wind to the little lamb,

21
00:00:57,043 --> 00:00:58,876
do you see what I see?

22
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:04,626
A star, a star, dancing in the night

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,489
with a tail as big as a kite.

24
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:15,048
With a tail as big as a kite.

25
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,824
- Every year, we deal with this.

26
00:01:19,824 --> 00:01:22,294
When do you start listening
to Christmas music?

27
00:01:22,294 --> 00:01:24,441
I'm fine with it as soon as possible.

28
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:28,879
Kendra, she likes to wait
until after Thanksgiving.

29
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:30,325
So let us know on the poll.

30
00:01:30,325 --> 00:01:31,947
When to start Christmas music.

31
00:01:31,947 --> 00:01:34,771
- [Jeremy] You were supposed
to be going to sleep.

32
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:38,938
- High above the trees, with
a voice as big as the sea.

33
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:45,056
A child, a child, shivers in the cold.

34
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:49,604
Let us bring us bring him silver and gold.

35
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:53,984
- I accidentally put on makeup.

36
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:54,959
- [Jeremy] Accidentally?

37
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:55,910
- Yeah.

38
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:58,491
- [Jeremy] How did that
happen accidentally?

39
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:01,741
- Because I wanted some more makeup on.

40
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,704
- [Jeremy] That doesn't sound like

41
00:02:04,704 --> 00:02:05,777
- For a day.

42
00:02:05,777 --> 00:02:06,691
- [Jeremy] Doesn't sound like an accident.

43
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,519
It sounds like you did it on purpose.

44
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:10,352
No?

45
00:02:10,352 --> 00:02:12,227
Just an accident?

46
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:14,221
What is an accident?

47
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:15,471
- It means that

48
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:24,794
you have to wash off makeup.

49
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:29,553
That's what makeup has to get off.

50
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:30,911
- [Jeremy] If you want to
use makeup in the future,

51
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:32,785
you need to ask us, OK?

52
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:33,618
- Mmmhmm.

53
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,077
(Rock music)

54
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,858
(Children cheering)

55
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:44,489
- [Jeremy] Separate them out.

56
00:02:44,489 --> 00:02:45,675
Work together.

57
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:48,113
- First candies go right here.

58
00:02:48,113 --> 00:02:50,595
- [Child] Airheads and gum and Twizzlers

59
00:02:50,595 --> 00:02:51,914
all go together.

60
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:53,925
- I have a ton of Tootsie Rolls.

61
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,157
- [Kendra] One of my
questions for you guys

62
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:56,772
is if there's more chocolate-based candy

63
00:02:56,772 --> 00:02:58,326
or more fruit-based candy?

64
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:00,216
- [Jeremy] We might have
to chart it, graph it.

65
00:03:00,216 --> 00:03:03,403
- I love how Kendra can
take a normal activity

66
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:06,190
and turn it into an
amazing school opportunity.

67
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,442
- Another question I
have is, if each member

68
00:03:08,442 --> 00:03:10,626
of our family got the
exact same number of candy,

69
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:12,238
how many candies would we each get?

70
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:13,395
- A hundred!

71
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,631
- [Man] You'll have to calculate it.

72
00:03:14,631 --> 00:03:18,803
- Yellow, yellow, yellow,
yellow, yellow, yellow,

73
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:21,517
brown, brown, brown, brown, brown.

74
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:24,184
(Ominous music)

75
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:31,394
- [Child] All done.

76
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:34,001
- [Jeremy] Alright, did you guys sort it?

77
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,312
- [Unison] Yep.

78
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:37,280
- [Jeremy] Okay, now we
need to inventory it.

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,255
- What's that?

80
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:41,668
- [Jeremy] Inventory is when
you write down what you have.

81
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:43,251
- [Child] 6, 8, 10.

82
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:47,106
- [Jeremy] So you want to do
Tootsie Roll and then short.

83
00:03:47,106 --> 00:03:48,508
Tootsie Roll, mini.

84
00:03:48,508 --> 00:03:50,019
Tootsie Roll, fat.

85
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,072
Does that make sense?

86
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:54,272
So that when we alphabetize
it, they'll all be together.

87
00:03:54,272 --> 00:03:56,297
- I did 5+5 and I was right.

88
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:57,130
- [Jeremy] So you did some math?

89
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,817
- Three and two, three and two.

90
00:03:58,817 --> 00:03:59,853
- [Jeremy] Hey guys,
how many pieces of candy

91
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:00,686
do you think we have?

92
00:04:00,686 --> 00:04:01,804
- 200.

93
00:04:01,804 --> 00:04:02,637
- [Jeremy] 200?

94
00:04:02,637 --> 00:04:03,470
What do you think, Elise?

95
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,596
- [Elise] I think 500.

96
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:07,865
- And I'll take the middle with 300.

97
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:09,078
- [Jeremy] 300, what do you think, Mom?

98
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:09,911
- 426.

99
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,588
- I think that there is 501.

100
00:04:15,228 --> 00:04:16,416
I'm going to take the highest number.

101
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,265
I think it's above 500.

102
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:19,680
- Okay, let's add it up.

103
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
So you guys had over 60 kinds of candy.

104
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:25,733
62 different kinds, and I
can do auto-sum right here

105
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,024
and the number's going to spit out here.

106
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:27,857
You ready to see it?

107
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:28,690
- [Unison] Uh-huh.

108
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,440
- Okay, and the total
is 645 pieces of candy.

109
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:35,175
- That's a lot.

110
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:38,850
- You guys did good trick-or-treating.

111
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,967
Some of those were packs
full of other candy, too.

112
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:44,513
So now that we have the data, Excel lets

113
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:45,951
us move stuff around.

114
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:48,463
Like we can organize it alphabetically.

115
00:04:48,463 --> 00:04:50,810
We could put it in order
from biggest to smallest.

116
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,309
We could create types,
like chocolate or fruity.

117
00:04:53,309 --> 00:04:55,896
Hard candy or soft or chewy, and then

118
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,558
we can categorize it and see how many

119
00:04:57,558 --> 00:04:59,404
there are of all the
different types of candy.

120
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:00,467
- [Kendra] And we could make graphs.

121
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,190
- Or, we could just eat lunch.

122
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,023
- [Children] Haha.

123
00:05:03,023 --> 00:05:04,466
- You guys hungry?

124
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:05,350
- [Kendra] Let's eat lunch first.

125
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:07,727
Are you such a big girl?

126
00:05:07,727 --> 00:05:10,061
Look at you just standing up.

127
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:11,389
This is her new favorite
place, because it's

128
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,632
the perfect spot for her to stand up.

129
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:15,465
Hi.

130
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:19,418
One handed, you're a big girl!

131
00:05:20,457 --> 00:05:22,790
- [Jeremy] Go on and get it.

132
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:27,038
Look at those little steps.

133
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:28,165
Take a step.

134
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:29,165
There we go!

135
00:05:32,182 --> 00:05:33,692
She's so happy.

136
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:37,333
So, Isaac is sharing with
us his earliest memory.

137
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,423
And what is your earliest memory?

138
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:43,054
- It's, well it used to
be a nightmare for me,

139
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:45,322
and I still remember a lot of it.

140
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:48,922
Bob the Builder, turkeys and
kangaroos were chasing me.

141
00:05:48,922 --> 00:05:50,433
- [Jeremy] I hate when I have that dream.

142
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,402
- So I remember, he was
about three years old,

143
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:55,410
and I remember him coming
running into our room

144
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,518
in the middle of the night, crying,

145
00:05:56,518 --> 00:05:58,795
"Mom! Turkeys! Mom! Turkeys!"

146
00:05:58,795 --> 00:05:59,628
What?

147
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:02,353
- [Jeremy] And Bob the Builder.

148
00:06:02,353 --> 00:06:03,419
- So I'd love to hear in the comments

149
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:05,492
what your earliest memory is.

150
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:06,876
Let us know in the comments.

151
00:06:06,876 --> 00:06:08,141
- I remember yours.

152
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,951
- [Jeremy] You remember
my earliest memory?

153
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:11,313
- [Kendra] How do you know that?

154
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:13,778
- You were like kind of, you've told us.

155
00:06:13,778 --> 00:06:15,381
Like, you're in the
swimming pool kind of like

156
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,679
a bathtub and you told
your grandma that you

157
00:06:17,679 --> 00:06:20,560
looked like him, because of the raisins.

158
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,394
- [Kendra] Basically, we're doing all

159
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:23,009
of our school with candy today.

160
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,759
I figure, once a year, it's just more fun.

161
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,092
Your handwriting is awesome!

162
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,001
We work hard, my kindergartner dude!

163
00:06:30,001 --> 00:06:31,973
Can I have a high five?

164
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,480
Are you going to eat a Twix to celebrate?

165
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,009
Ealey's just finished alphabetizing.

166
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:37,899
Isaac's list and his rankings.

167
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:39,736
So number one, Swedish Fish.

168
00:06:39,736 --> 00:06:42,613
Is that what you're eating?

169
00:06:42,613 --> 00:06:45,011
Trying to eat those buckles?

170
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,011
Haha, she's standing up!

171
00:06:48,364 --> 00:06:49,601
- [Child] She's like a tiger.

172
00:06:49,601 --> 00:06:52,101
- [Kendra] She's like a tiger?

173
00:06:55,117 --> 00:06:57,187
Isaac is working on a
creative writing assignment.

174
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:58,835
You've gotta see what he's writing about.

175
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,621
The Perspective of A
Candy on Halloween Night.

176
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,922
So what kind of a candy
are you writing about?

177
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,576
- A Starburst; his name is Cherry.

178
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:07,927
Doesn't even know why.

179
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,142
They just put it on his wrapper.

180
00:07:10,142 --> 00:07:10,975
- [Kendra] Yeah.

181
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:12,898
Are they excited to get
eaten, or nervous about it?

182
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,665
- Well he's excited because his parents

183
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:17,757
and ancestors are in the belly of someone.

184
00:07:17,757 --> 00:07:18,610
- [Kendra] Uh oh.

185
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:19,925
- So he can go and join them.

186
00:07:19,925 --> 00:07:20,943
- [Kendra] Uh oh.

187
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,380
- And not be lonely.

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,516
- [Kendra] He must not know about poop.

189
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:26,933
(Fart noise)

190
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:30,059
- Ah!

191
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:30,892
- Ah!

192
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,378
- [Jeremy] Haha.

193
00:07:34,378 --> 00:07:36,218
- I think the kids might
be enjoying the popper toys

194
00:07:36,218 --> 00:07:38,749
a little more than the candy
they got for Halloween.

195
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,769
- [Child] What are you doing?

196
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:41,208
- Ah!

197
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,672
- So, in the past, our
family has taken our

198
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,229
Halloween candy and, a day or two

199
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,338
after Halloween we donate
it to Operation Gratitude.

200
00:07:47,338 --> 00:07:49,136
At least I think that's it's name.

201
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,178
It sends the candy over to US soldiers

202
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,267
that are stationed in
different parts of the world

203
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:55,794
to make them smile and
help them feel happy.

204
00:07:55,794 --> 00:07:57,273
I wanted to talk to the
kids about it today,

205
00:07:57,273 --> 00:07:58,705
because they are getting
older and I want to see

206
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,290
what they are feeling up to.

207
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,262
- [Jeremy] So, Isaac, how are you feeling

208
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:04,269
about the idea of donating your candy.

209
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:06,525
- I like that we get to
give it to other people.

210
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:09,694
Like, I want to give some,
but I do like having candy,

211
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:12,772
so I want some for our family.

212
00:08:12,772 --> 00:08:15,667
- This much to donate
and that much to keep.

213
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,925
- If we ate too much
candy, we would get sick.

214
00:08:18,925 --> 00:08:19,758
- [Jeremy] That is an issue.

215
00:08:19,758 --> 00:08:21,731
- [Child] They're just
going to take all of it.

216
00:08:21,731 --> 00:08:25,057
- If a whole new family got this candy,

217
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:29,224
we would have to go trick-or-treating
and Halloween again.

218
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:31,762
- [Jeremy] Yeah, tonight we'll have to

219
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:32,754
go trick-or-treating.-

220
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:33,649
- So we'll have to do it again

221
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:34,683
if we give away this candy.

222
00:08:34,683 --> 00:08:35,850
Hey baby girl!

223
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,656
So it's interesting to get the kid's

224
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,743
input and ideas about this, this year.

225
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:44,480
Like, I don't want to force
them to donate their candy,

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,638
I'm just bringing it up.

227
00:08:45,638 --> 00:08:46,613
What do they think we should do

228
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:47,527
with this amount of candy?

229
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,400
I think what we've
decided is that each kid

230
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,458
is going to get a bag to
put their own candy in.

231
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,213
The things they want to keep,

232
00:08:53,213 --> 00:08:55,221
and then we are going to donate the rest.

233
00:08:55,221 --> 00:08:56,606
How does that sound?

234
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:57,439
- Good!

235
00:08:57,439 --> 00:08:58,272
- Good!

236
00:08:58,272 --> 00:08:59,161
- All in favor?

237
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:00,763
- [Jeremy] We just haven't told
them how big the bag is yet?

238
00:09:00,763 --> 00:09:02,163
- Hahaha.

239
00:09:02,163 --> 00:09:03,093
- [Jeremy] It could be a tiny little bag.

240
00:09:03,093 --> 00:09:03,926
- Gotcha.

241
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:10,540
- More of the Reeses Peanut Butter Cups.

242
00:09:14,997 --> 00:09:16,997
- [Child] 9, 10, 11, 12.

243
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:23,809
- [Jeremy] That's the donating pile.

244
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:25,309
Put it in the bag.

245
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:39,826
- So there's a dental practice in our area

246
00:09:39,826 --> 00:09:42,177
that accepts the candy and
ships it off to the soldiers.

247
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:43,773
- [Jeremy] Let's go!

248
00:09:43,773 --> 00:09:45,651
- [Child] We're donating our candy!

249
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,002
- [Woman] Wow!

250
00:09:47,002 --> 00:09:48,361
- [Jeremy] We decided
it would be smartest to

251
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,314
divide the candy into four different bags

252
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:51,990
for each of them to hold.

253
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,716
- Over eight and half pounds of candy.

254
00:09:54,716 --> 00:09:55,611
- [Woman] That's a lot of candy.

255
00:09:55,611 --> 00:09:57,278
- [Jeremy] Good job.

256
00:10:04,461 --> 00:10:05,804
Thanks, man.

257
00:10:05,804 --> 00:10:06,827
- It's Christmas in here.

258
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:07,934
- [Jeremy] It happened.

259
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:08,882
- [Child] It's Christmas!

260
00:10:08,882 --> 00:10:09,715
- [Jeremy] Didn't you hear?

261
00:10:09,715 --> 00:10:10,728
Halloween happened;
now it's Christmastime.

262
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:13,478
("Jingle Bells")

263
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:29,013
- We always skip my favorite
holiday, Thanksgiving.

264
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,488
- [Jeremy] Yeah, I talked about it today.

265
00:10:30,488 --> 00:10:31,890
- Did you talk about that already?

266
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,077
- [Jeremy] Caleb was
singing a Christmas song.

267
00:10:33,077 --> 00:10:35,931
- You're like, "You better
not do that around Mom."

268
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,912
This pillow is perfect for me.

269
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:39,418
- [Jeremy] Kendra's pillow.

270
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:40,593
- [Kendra] Look at these sugar cookies.

271
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:41,582
- Pumpkin!

272
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:42,800
- [Kendra] Look at these
peanut butter cookies.

273
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,037
Oh my.

274
00:10:44,037 --> 00:10:46,249
- Caleb, look, pumpkin cookies!

275
00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:47,526
- [Kendra] There's turkeys.

276
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:49,036
- [Jeremy] Hey, that's Thanksgiving.

277
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:51,031
- [Kendra] I know, way to celebrate!

278
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,449
- I'm heavy.

279
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:53,782
- You are heavy.

280
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,175
- [Jeremy] Dancing?

281
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:06,008
- Dancing?

282
00:11:08,305 --> 00:11:10,764
- [Jeremy] Look at that.

283
00:11:10,764 --> 00:11:14,514
- [Jeremy] Laura's
dancing, Elise is dancing.

284
00:11:18,085 --> 00:11:19,661
- You know, we're just that normal family

285
00:11:19,661 --> 00:11:23,744
with five little kids at
the restaurant, dancing.

286
00:11:28,443 --> 00:11:29,776
- She's dancing.

287
00:11:32,728 --> 00:11:35,442
(Baby screaming)

288
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:38,109
(Jeremy laughs)

289
00:11:42,616 --> 00:11:43,449
- [Child] Good night.

290
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:44,299
J House out.

291
00:11:44,299 --> 00:11:48,521
- [Kendra] Do you remember
when you auditioned?

292
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:51,247
(Upbeat music)

293
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:52,080
- Look!

294
00:11:54,152 --> 00:11:55,434
- It's for test flying.

295
00:11:55,434 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] It's for test flying, Caleb.
