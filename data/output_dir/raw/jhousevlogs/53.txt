1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:02,658
- [Jenn] Laura, how does the
seashell let us hear the ocean?

2
00:00:02,658 --> 00:00:04,652
- I don't know.

3
00:00:04,652 --> 00:00:07,235
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,242
- She just did it again!

5
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:12,188
It's so cute and I'm losing my mind!

6
00:00:12,188 --> 00:00:13,901
I'm making some last-minute purchases

7
00:00:13,901 --> 00:00:15,003
to get ready for Elisa's birthday.

8
00:00:15,003 --> 00:00:17,586
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:24,538
What are you working on?

10
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:27,532
- Mix and stir it.

11
00:00:27,532 --> 00:00:32,532
- [Jenn] So Laura has rocks
and all these sea animals

12
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:33,614
and what's in the water?

13
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:34,909
- Shaving cream.

14
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,137
- [Jenn] The shaving cream
was what's in the water.

15
00:00:38,137 --> 00:00:40,119
I just put a few dollops
of shaving cream in there.

16
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:41,430
What are you working on?

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,467
- I'm trying to sort all of these

18
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:44,706
and then look in the book

19
00:00:44,706 --> 00:00:48,341
and see what these might have lived in it.

20
00:00:48,341 --> 00:00:49,924
- [Jenn] So let's see you sort them out.

21
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,065
There's lots of different
kinds of seashells, huh?

22
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:53,635
Those ones are teeny-tiny.

23
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,763
Look at how little those ones are.

24
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:57,302
- [Caleb] Look what I found.

25
00:00:57,302 --> 00:01:00,291
- [Jenn] Those ones are really pretty.

26
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,857
- They're the same as these but littler.

27
00:01:01,857 --> 00:01:02,940
- [Jenn] Yep.

28
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,861
Did you find a match?

29
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,657
- Yeah, but what lives in this?

30
00:01:09,657 --> 00:01:11,007
- [Jenn] So the animal that used to live

31
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:13,798
in that seashell is called
an Atlantic oyster drill.

32
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:16,039
- [Caleb] This looks like a drill.

33
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,067
(imitates drill noise)

34
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,275
- [Jenn] It does look kinda like a drill.

35
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:23,692
- Atlantic oyster drills
like to eat oysters.

36
00:01:23,692 --> 00:01:25,269
- "The blanket was red.

37
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:27,687
"He pulled the other side, too."

38
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,254
(Janae babbling)

39
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:31,271
"And they all snuggled
close in the blanket

40
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,592
"that was red."

41
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:33,928
(Janae babbling)

42
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:35,640
"And then, at last, Mrs. Bear said,

43
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,705
"Oh no, I know!

44
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,063
"Kiss good night." (kisses)

45
00:01:39,063 --> 00:01:40,540
The end.

46
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,028
Yay!

47
00:01:42,028 --> 00:01:43,238
- [Jenn] So this is the seashell

48
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:44,847
that we found on the beach the other day.

49
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:45,834
Uh-oh.

50
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:47,042
There came some sand out.

51
00:01:47,042 --> 00:01:48,322
Yes, I found it when we
were doing family pictures.

52
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:50,605
- It just kinda washed up.

53
00:01:50,605 --> 00:01:51,642
- From the sea?

54
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,583
So it's big enough you can actually hear

55
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,814
the ocean in it.

56
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,274
I don't know how that works, but it works.

57
00:01:57,274 --> 00:01:58,233
Laura, have you heard the ocean?

58
00:01:58,233 --> 00:01:59,066
- [Laura] No.

59
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,321
- Come on over here.

60
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,364
- [Caleb] Can you hear the ocean?

61
00:02:01,364 --> 00:02:03,258
(Jenn shushing)

62
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,572
- I can hear it.

63
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:05,490
- [Jenn] You can hear it?

64
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:06,367
Can you hear the waves?

65
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,050
(Jenn imitating waves)

66
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,409
- Yeah.

67
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,702
- [Jenn] Yeah?

68
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:12,611
(laughs)

69
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:13,985
- It's so cool!

70
00:02:13,985 --> 00:02:15,572
- [Jenn] What does it sound like?

71
00:02:15,572 --> 00:02:17,545
(imitating ocean noise)

72
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:19,041
Hey, that's really good.

73
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,346
Laura, how does the seashell
let us hear the ocean?

74
00:02:21,346 --> 00:02:22,596
- I don't know.

75
00:02:23,481 --> 00:02:24,809
- [Jenn] Look inside.

76
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,154
- There's nothing in it.

77
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:27,637
- [Jenn] Right, there's nothing in it.

78
00:02:27,637 --> 00:02:28,799
- Is there like a battery?

79
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:30,296
- [Jenn] There's no batteries.

80
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:31,323
- I think I know how.

81
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:32,538
- [Jenn] How?

82
00:02:32,538 --> 00:02:33,876
- It might be

83
00:02:33,876 --> 00:02:35,393
shallow or something?

84
00:02:35,393 --> 00:02:36,547
- [Jenn] Shallow.

85
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:37,445
- [Laura] Shallow?

86
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:39,260
- That if you put your ear to it,

87
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,029
it makes those sounds.

88
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:42,663
- [Jenn] So Laura told me she figured out

89
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,633
how it works.

90
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:44,466
- Magic.

91
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,105
- [Jenn] Is there magic in it?

92
00:02:46,105 --> 00:02:47,533
- Yeah.

93
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,059
- [Jenn] Nice.

94
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,733
- I can hear it!

95
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:53,316
(upbeat music)

96
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:55,062
- So I'm at Target by myself because

97
00:02:55,062 --> 00:02:56,969
I'm making some last-minute purchases

98
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:59,195
to get read for Elisa's birthday.

99
00:02:59,195 --> 00:03:00,630
We have a birthday season in our family,

100
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,233
which just means that a bunch

101
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,623
of the kids' birthdays
are really close together

102
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:05,632
and Elisa's is the beginning of it.

103
00:03:05,632 --> 00:03:07,090
I can't believe it.

104
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,924
She's gonna be eight years old.

105
00:03:08,924 --> 00:03:10,507
That is just crazy.

106
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,347
(Jeremy and Laura singing)

107
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:17,227
So Laura is learning the 50 Nifty

108
00:03:17,227 --> 00:03:18,707
United States song

109
00:03:18,707 --> 00:03:22,355
and she's singing it over and over

110
00:03:22,355 --> 00:03:23,188
and over and over again

111
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:25,553

We're gonna enjoy the fresh air

119

You ready to go on a way?

128
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:00,225
- Yep.

129
00:04:00,225 --> 00:04:01,058
- [Jenn] Let's do it.

130
00:04:01,058 --> 00:04:02,247
- But it might still be stuck in my head.

131
00:04:02,247 --> 00:04:03,528
- [Jenn] I know, that's how songs work,

132
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:04,557
they get stuck there,

133
00:04:04,557 --> 00:04:05,569
even when you can't hear them.

134
00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:08,579

the walks are actually
really good workouts,

145
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:32,944
so that's a good thing.

146
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:35,777
(Classical music)

147
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:39,691
The hill so steep that it's almost harder

148
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:41,244
to walk downhill than uphill,

149
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:42,655
have you guys noticed that?

150
00:04:42,655 --> 00:04:44,026
That's always weird to me.

151
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:44,877
Look how big those leaves are.

152
00:04:44,877 --> 00:04:47,699
- That's even bigger than my face.

153
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:49,001
- [Jenn] I know, it's gorgeous, too.

154
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,414
Walking is one of my
favorite ways to exercise,

155
00:04:51,414 --> 00:04:53,205
so I love it when a walk is also a really

156
00:04:53,205 --> 00:04:54,284
good workout.

157
00:04:54,284 --> 00:04:55,527
I've been pushing Janae for a while.

158
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:56,511
It's nice to have the kids

159
00:04:56,511 --> 00:04:57,620
be able to take a turn.

160
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,647
It just feels good to be outside.

161
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:01,480
(Classical music)

162
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:06,618
Keep pushin'.

163
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,336
This is quite the hill.

164
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:09,169
You guys resting?

165
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:13,500
They found a way to
work together. (laughs)

166
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,748
Janae's the one with the comfy ride.

167
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,313
Hi, hi.

168
00:05:17,313 --> 00:05:20,146
(Classical music)

169
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,987
Wanna get out and play?

170
00:05:27,568 --> 00:05:28,550
- Chapter book.

171
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:31,409
- [Jenn] It is a chapter book.

172
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:32,576
The Bug House.

173
00:05:38,574 --> 00:05:41,088
Here's Isaac in his natural habitat.

174
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:43,667
At the library with a sports book.

175
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:44,724
We found some great books.

176
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:47,008
Now we're just gonna sit down and read.

177
00:05:47,008 --> 00:05:49,841
(Classical music)

178
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:57,141
Did you find some books?

179
00:05:59,294 --> 00:06:00,433
- Why are there snowmen?

180
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:01,848
- [Jenn] 'Cause they're trying to think

181
00:06:01,848 --> 00:06:02,878
about wintertime here too.

182
00:06:02,878 --> 00:06:06,665
But it doesn't really feel
like wintertime, does it?

183
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:07,758
- I'm wearing summer clothes.

184
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:10,489
- [Jenn] You are wearing summer clothes.

185
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:11,322
She's doing it.

186
00:06:11,322 --> 00:06:13,458
Janae is learning how to do something new

187
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,252
at the library.

188
00:06:15,252 --> 00:06:16,913
She's climbed up on the step two times.

189
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:18,588
Let's see if she does it again.

190
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:22,099
Oh my goodness (gasps),
she just did it again!

191
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,011
She climbed up that step right there.

192
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:27,732
Are you so proud of yourself?

193
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:29,757
Yeah, let's see it again, Nae.

194
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,590
Laura, that looks pretty comfy.

195
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,353
Can you really read the words?

196
00:06:33,353 --> 00:06:35,738
- No, I'm just looking at 'em.

197
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:37,723
- [Jenn] Would you like
me to get you a book

198
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:38,556
with some pictures?

199
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:40,380
- A chapter book with pictures?

200
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,145
- [Jenn] Sure.

201
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,170
How's that one?

202
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,670
- Good, thank you.

203
00:06:45,579 --> 00:06:47,683
The Berenstain Bears.

204
00:06:47,683 --> 00:06:51,220
- [Jenn] Oh my goodness,
look at her climb.

205
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,689
- [Caleb] Come to me, Nae-Nae.

206
00:06:52,689 --> 00:06:54,044
- [Jenn] You did it!

207
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,327
Yay!

208
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,632
(babbles)

209
00:06:57,632 --> 00:07:00,715
Janae could not do this before today.

210
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:03,646
She's so proud of herself.

211
00:07:03,646 --> 00:07:04,970
- So for the last couple of days

212
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,469
I've been listening to
The Greatest Showman

213
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:07,591
music a lot.

214
00:07:07,591 --> 00:07:08,510
It's really good.

215
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,057
I went to the movie, and
I didn't enjoy the movie

216
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:13,130
as much because it went so fast,

217
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,543
and it felt kind of
like there wasn't depth

218
00:07:14,543 --> 00:07:15,903
to a lot of the characters.

219
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,849
It was kind of like a big montage

220
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,602
instead of, like, going as deep,

221
00:07:20,602 --> 00:07:22,318
but now that I'm listening to the music

222
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:23,276
and I'm more familiar with it,

223
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,895
I think I would like the movie a lot more.

224
00:07:24,895 --> 00:07:26,066
Let us know on the poll,

225
00:07:26,066 --> 00:07:27,891
have you seen the movie
The Greatest Showman,

226
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,224
and what did you think of it?

227
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:30,685
- [Jenn] Caleb, what are you doing?

228
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:31,954
- Making a treehouse.

229
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,346
- [Jenn] You're making a treehouse?

230
00:07:33,346 --> 00:07:36,016
This is pretty interesting.

231
00:07:36,016 --> 00:07:38,540
So Caleb grabbed the foam pads

232
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:42,540
that are over there and
is building a treehouse.

233
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,487
So Caleb read a book about Curious George

234
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,042
building a treehouse and
then he was insistent

235
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,596
on building a treehouse right now.

236
00:07:49,596 --> 00:07:50,673
I'm like, "Dude, we're inside.

237
00:07:50,673 --> 00:07:52,173
"You can't build a
treehouse, we're inside"

238
00:07:52,173 --> 00:07:54,539
and lo and behold, he
figured out a way to do it.

239
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,319
He collected these rubber mats

240
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,904
and is assembling his very own treehouse.

241
00:07:58,904 --> 00:08:00,914
- Welcome to my treehouse.

242
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,407
- [Jenn] How do you get in?

243
00:08:02,407 --> 00:08:03,240
- Crawl under there.

244
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,803
- [Jenn] Here's how Caleb gets in and out.

245
00:08:06,803 --> 00:08:08,053
The army crawl.

246
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,952
- Here's the front door.

247
00:08:10,952 --> 00:08:12,515
- [Jenn] That's a nice front door.

248
00:08:12,515 --> 00:08:13,959
Ooh!

249
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,122
There you are.

250
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:17,789
Do you know what letter that is?

251
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:19,595
- For Laura.

252
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,896
- [Jenn] It is, it's
an R, that's in Laura.

253
00:08:22,896 --> 00:08:24,507
Where's the match?

254
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,810
Where's the match?

255
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,845
(gasps) Good job, there it is!

256
00:08:27,845 --> 00:08:28,678
- Thank you.

257
00:08:28,678 --> 00:08:31,100
- Down in the forest,
the bears started to --

258
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,741
- [Jeremy] Thanks for folding, you guys.

259
00:08:32,741 --> 00:08:36,201
- We're gonna play a game of Monopoly,

260
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,168
if we get this done.

261
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:40,751
(upbeat music)

262
00:08:42,595 --> 00:08:46,210
- [Jenn] So Jeremy's on a business call.

263
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,960
And playing football.

264
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:53,549
That made my heart so happy

265
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:55,075
to see Jeremy playing with the kids

266
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,033
while he's on his business call.

267
00:08:57,033 --> 00:08:57,923
I could never do that.

268
00:08:57,923 --> 00:09:00,108
Like, I can't multitask like that.

269
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:01,703
When I'm doing something,
it has all my attention

270
00:09:01,703 --> 00:09:03,684
and anything else I
find super distracting.

271
00:09:03,684 --> 00:09:04,848
Jeremy is a multitasking master.

272
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,679
Like, the more things he's doing,

273
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,974
the more focused he gets, somehow.

274
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:10,012
I don't understand how that works.

275
00:09:10,012 --> 00:09:11,184
- [Jeremy] Well, tonight we finish

276
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,214
our first read-aloud book while we're here

277
00:09:13,214 --> 00:09:15,344
in San Diego, The Great Horn Spoon.

278
00:09:15,344 --> 00:09:16,569
How've you liked it?

279
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:17,402
- I've liked it.

280
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:18,632
- Yeah, so, in this book there's like

281
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,918
all these cowboy miners that have their

282
00:09:20,918 --> 00:09:22,426
talk that they used.

283
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:23,563
- Ruination!

284
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,779
- [Jeremy] Ruination!

285
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,358
- Tarnation!

286
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,022
- They're goin' to the diggin's.

287
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:29,720
And then there's Praiseworthy,
who's from Boston.

288
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,814
He's very proper.

289
00:09:30,814 --> 00:09:32,330
- [Elisa] And Jack.

290
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,163
- And Jack.

291
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:34,418
- I'm almost at 23,000.

292
00:09:34,418 --> 00:09:35,947
- [Jeremy] All right, good, get it done

293
00:09:35,947 --> 00:09:38,127
so we can read our book.

294
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,414
- [Laura] He's red in the face.

295
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,940
- [Jeremy] This has
been the last hour here,

296
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,696
him running in circles around the house.

297
00:09:42,696 --> 00:09:43,529
- Same with me.

298
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:44,555
- [Jeremy] You've been doing that too?

299
00:09:44,555 --> 00:09:45,595
You got it?

300
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:46,428
23,000.

301
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,777
- Good night, J House out.

302
00:09:49,777 --> 00:09:50,950
- So we're headed out hiking today.

303
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,533
(upbeat music)

304
00:09:55,099 --> 00:09:57,214
- So they found the clues
for the treasure hunt.

305
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:58,131
Eat a lime?

306
00:10:03,058 --> 00:00:00,000
They're just snugglin' with mom.
