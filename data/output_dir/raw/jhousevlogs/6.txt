1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:02,886
(laughter)

2
00:00:03,956 --> 00:00:06,873
(orchestral music)

3
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:25,310
- [Jeremy] We doing oatmeal this morning?

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,420
Nae-nae, you wanna try some oatmeal?

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,130
So we were supposed to be
cleaning up the front room

6
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:36,800
and the basement all together.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,597
This is what ended up happening.

8
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:42,768
♪ Pocket full of posies ♪

9
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:45,685
♪ We all fall down ♪

10
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:48,411
She's like, I'll just stand.

11
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:50,578
(giggles)

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,960
Show me your new trick.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,480
We have moved her little
baby gate that we had here

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,120
'cause she is just flying down the stairs.

15
00:01:01,971 --> 00:01:03,852
(laughter)

16
00:01:03,852 --> 00:01:04,800
- See what I mean?

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,200
- [Jeremy] Good job Nae-nae.

18
00:01:09,564 --> 00:01:11,956
- I can't even do it faster than her.

19
00:01:11,956 --> 00:01:14,206
(laughter)

20
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:24,616
(upbeat music)

21
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:32,180
We have the amazing Nae-nae.

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,013
- [Jeremy] Did she put it on herself?

23
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:34,665
- Yeah.

24
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:35,915
- [Jeremy] Hey.

25
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,210
- [Caleb] It's a football helmet.

26
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,533
- [Jeremy] She likes that hat.

27
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,855
Good job cleaning up down here you guys.

28
00:01:46,855 --> 00:01:49,438
(upbeat music)

29
00:01:54,796 --> 00:01:56,160
- So I am so sore today.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,950
My workout yesterday must
have been more intense

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,870
than I realized because every movement,

32
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,000
every time I bend or step
up a stair, I'm like ahhh.

33
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:06,691
(upbeat music)

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,933
- Fancy Nancy and the
Fanciest Doll in the Universe.

35
00:02:22,358 --> 00:02:23,891
Do you have siblings?

36
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,376
That's Fancy Nancy for sister or brother.

37
00:02:26,376 --> 00:02:28,876
(piano music)

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,880
We scheduled a field
trip to the local water

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,950
treatment plant to learn
how water comes out

40
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,170
clean from the faucet.

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,290
The nerd that I am, I am super
excited to learn about it.

42
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,040
- I think it's amazing that
we live in a day and age

43
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,460
where we don't know what
happens to our water.

44
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,693
And we want to know what
happens to our water.

45
00:02:46,693 --> 00:02:47,526
We just take it for granted.

46
00:02:47,526 --> 00:02:49,270
We turn on the faucet and it comes out.

47
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,291
But what's the processes behind that?

48
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:52,986
We decided to figure it out.

49
00:02:52,986 --> 00:02:55,569
(upbeat music)

50
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,270
- [Jeremy] So this is
what makes it possible

51
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,333
for us to turn on our
faucet and have clean water.

52
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,756
(upbeat music)

53
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:11,900
Whoa.

54
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,310
Look straight down you guys.

55
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,857
That's the water right down there.

56
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:18,440
(upbeat music)

57
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,790
So five miles away, there is
an underground water supply

58
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,760
in wells and they pump
the water from there

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,100
five miles away in pipes
up to this right here.

60
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,140
So the line comes into
the water in the middle

61
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,354
to help separate the
calcium out of the water.

62
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:42,470
(upbeat music)

63
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:46,233
So then the cleaner water
is gonna exit right there.

64
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,899
It's leaving.

65
00:03:48,899 --> 00:03:49,732
(upbeat music)

66
00:03:49,732 --> 00:03:52,740
Then they add chlorine
into the water here.

67
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,640
- I'm making dinner right now.

68
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,010
We're having some people over tonight

69
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,580
and I'm keeping it really simple.

70
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,290
We're having pasta, red and white pasta,

71
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,750
which is one of our favorites,
rolls, salad, veggies, done.

72
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,040
Here's the red and white
pasta before the red's added.

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,150
It's a creamy sauce on the noodles.

74
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,790
Then I pour the red sauce on top.

75
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,560
- So for the community we live in,

76
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,780
this plant pumps over nine
million gallons a day.

77
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,079
You think of a gallon of
milk, nine million of those

78
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,640
run through here everyday.

79
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:23,224
(upbeat music)

80
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,480
So the filtering that they use is really

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,880
just sand that the water distills through

82
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,370
and that pulls iron and other materials

83
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,364
out of the water that we don't want

84
00:04:34,364 --> 00:04:35,734
until it trickles at the bottom

85
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,777
and distills into more pure water.

86
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,360
(upbeat music)

87
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,270
That holds some of the chlorine that gets

88
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,563
pumped into the water.

89
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:48,610
(upbeat music)

90
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,684
So this is where they add the
fluoride to help our teeth.

91
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,050
So you don't have as many cavities.

92
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,730
- The more you drink, doesn't that mean

93
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,700
the more your teeth are better?

94
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,139
(upbeat music)

95
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,120
- [Jeremy] So after the
water goes through all that

96
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,830
it sits here underneath us as clean water,

97
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,810
the type that we would
drink out of our faucet.

98
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,224
So Isaac, Elise, why do you
think they've covered this one?

99
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:22,490
- So air can't get into it?

100
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,253
- So it stays cleaner.

101
00:05:24,253 --> 00:05:25,480
- Yep, keep it clean.

102
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,130
So in this building they
have pumps that help

103
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,860
take the clean water and
pump it to the water towers

104
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,570
that are here in our community.

105
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,573
Then once the water is
sitting in the water tower,

106
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,420
gravity allows the
pressure to get the water

107
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,490
into the homes of the community.

108
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:46,020
So Laura, where does the
water come from that we drink?

109
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,853
- From God.

110
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,386
- [Jeremy] How did God get it to us?

111
00:05:50,386 --> 00:05:51,219
- I don't know.

112
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:52,940
- [Jeremy] He just made it come out?

113
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,360
- He has power to create everything.

114
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,160
- [Jeremy] So when Janae
is going down the stairs,

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,233
her little skirt rides high.

116
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,140
It's so funny.

117
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,973
There we go.

118
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
There we go.

119
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,143
How's the ball?

120
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:17,788
(upbeat music)

121
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,414
Did it land on your foot?

122
00:06:28,414 --> 00:06:29,947
There we go.

123
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:32,530
(upbeat music)

124
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:36,500
- It's so much different to drink water

125
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,130
than it used to be
after learning about it.

126
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,972
- [Jeremy] Do you taste the
chlorine and the fluoride?

127
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:44,660
- Yes, because now I
know that it's in there

128
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,680
so I was like looking for
it and I can taste it.

129
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,143
- [Jeremy] Making snow balls.

130
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:52,703
- Or mud balls.

131
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,333
Tomorrow they're gonna be all crunched up.

132
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,081
- So before everybody
wakes up in the nighttime,

133
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,914
we're gonna come out here with-

134
00:07:01,914 --> 00:07:05,009
- Laura, I thought you were
not supposed to tell them.

135
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,890
(laughter)

136
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,080
- [Jeremy] You guys were
planning to come out

137
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,880
in the middle of the night?

138
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,060
- So right now I'm going to ballet

139
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,060
and in ballet, we are
practicing our performance.

140
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:23,474
(upbeat music)

141
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,800
- The weather is absolutely
amazing out today

142
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,730
and so while Isaac and I
are waiting for Elise's

143
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,030
ballet class, we decided
to find a nice trail

144
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,150
and go on a walk together.

145
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,250
So we're just kind of exploring back here.

146
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,320
There's a whole network of trails

147
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,699
and we're trying to find some fun places

148
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,139
to come back and ride bikes as a family.

149
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,230
And also we're looking for places to creek

150
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:47,180
as the weather gets warmer.

151
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,730
- There's a waterfall on that big creek.

152
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,740
- [Kendra] You think that
would be fun to go creeking in.

153
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,423
I wonder how you get down there.

154
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,810
I mean I think we just hike.

155
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,284
This looks like a super
fun spot to go creeking.

156
00:07:59,284 --> 00:08:02,279
(guitar music)

157
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,903
I think we found a spot to go in.

158
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,470
Whoa, that's steep.

159
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,286
Okay, we'll have to find
a different spot to go in.

160
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:12,869
(guitar music)

161
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,030
I'm relieved, it's starting
to finally feel like spring.

162
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,613
(guitar music)

163
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,130
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

164
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,383
- Ready, set, go.

165
00:08:27,922 --> 00:08:30,824
(upbeat music)

166
00:08:30,824 --> 00:08:31,657
(speaking Spanish)

167
00:08:31,657 --> 00:08:33,123
- Wow!

168
00:08:33,123 --> 00:00:00,000
(giggling)
