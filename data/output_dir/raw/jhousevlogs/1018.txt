1
00:00:01,148 --> 00:00:04,148
(eerie organ music)

2
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:09,236
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:33,229 --> 00:00:35,780
- [Jeremy] So Mom, how's
Halloween morning been?

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,613
How's it been?

5
00:00:36,613 --> 00:00:38,073
- It's been a little chaotic so far.

6
00:00:38,073 --> 00:00:40,771
I think I only threatened
to take Halloween away once.

7
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:43,166
(Jeremy laughs)

8
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:43,999
I'm kind of joking.

9
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,862
I didn't threaten to take Halloween away,

10
00:00:45,862 --> 00:00:49,191
I said maybe we wouldn't
carve our pumpkins

11
00:00:49,191 --> 00:00:50,970
because we were having
some lack of cooperation

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,809
over chores and schoolwork.

13
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:55,942
But I think the morning's turning around

14
00:00:55,942 --> 00:00:57,960
and I think we're gonna
have a great afternoon.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,960
And, hey can you say hi?

16
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,449
Hi. (laughs)
- There it is.

17
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:04,843
Alright, it's Friday

18
00:01:04,843 --> 00:01:06,168
which means Meals on Wheels

19
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:10,251
but it's a little bit more
exciting on Halloween.

20
00:01:11,116 --> 00:01:12,844
You guys excited?

21
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:14,097
- Yeah.

22
00:01:14,097 --> 00:01:15,514
- Come on, Cubby.

23
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,473
Go ahead and knock.

24
00:01:19,473 --> 00:01:22,367
(knocking)

25
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:23,776
- Alright, thank you, Pinterest.

26
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:26,311
We're having a festive food morning.

27
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:27,506
Actually, we've made these mummies

28
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:30,322
every year for several years.

29
00:01:30,322 --> 00:01:32,201
And here's their lunch.

30
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:34,868
We're having mummies and ghosts.

31
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:39,059
And what are you drinking, Lacey?

32
00:01:41,798 --> 00:01:42,715
What is it?

33
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:44,719
- Apple cider!

34
00:01:45,952 --> 00:01:49,853
- Alright, so every year we
let the kids paint pumpkins

35
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,317
instead of carve pumpkins.

36
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:53,420
It's just a lot of fun
and it's pretty easy.

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,963
So, Jeremy does the pumpkin
carving at our house

38
00:01:55,963 --> 00:01:58,570
because I am not allowed
to play with knives.

39
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,758
- We've learned by sad experience.

40
00:02:00,758 --> 00:02:03,175
Kendra and knives do not mix.

41
00:02:04,148 --> 00:02:07,045
- [Kendra] So I also don't cut watermelon.

42
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:08,733
Pretty much anything that's large or

43
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,126
requires a large knife.

44
00:02:11,126 --> 00:02:12,235
Woah!

45
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:13,945
Cool, Isaac!

46
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:16,377
Lacey, I love your polka dots!

47
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:17,877
Cubby, let me see!

48
00:02:18,792 --> 00:02:21,042
(babbling)

49
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:23,443
- Woah!

50
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:25,278
How did he do that?

51
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,278
- Woah! Wow!

52
00:02:27,464 --> 00:02:28,797
- That's a cake?

53
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,478
- That's not cake, that's pumpkin!

54
00:02:32,478 --> 00:02:33,746
- No!
- Did you like it, Isaac,

55
00:02:33,746 --> 00:02:36,061
the square eyes like you said?

56
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:38,319
With a little eyeball in between?

57
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,840
- [Kendra] Caleb, are
you admiring the pumpkin?

58
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,134
- Mm-Hmm.

59
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:44,855
- [Kendra] So guys, I totally
don't have any other candles

60
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:48,406
so we've got these little
tiny electrical candles.

61
00:02:48,406 --> 00:02:49,459
- [Jeremy] From last year.

62
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:50,773
- [Kendra] From last year.

63
00:02:50,773 --> 00:02:52,278
Anyway.

64
00:02:52,278 --> 00:02:53,553
- [Lacey] Can I see?

65
00:02:53,553 --> 00:02:55,282
- [Jeremy] We can make fire in
there, we'll get it to work.

66
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:56,754
- [Kendra] We'll figure it out.

67
00:02:56,754 --> 00:03:00,035
But I don't trust Caleb
right next to it at the edge.

68
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:00,868
- [Isaac] Why?

69
00:03:00,868 --> 00:03:03,005
- [Kendra] Okay, guys, what
should we name our pumpkin?

70
00:03:03,005 --> 00:03:04,911
- [Lacey] Kiki!

71
00:03:04,911 --> 00:03:06,387
- Orangelicious!

72
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:07,627
- [Kendra] Orangelicious?

73
00:03:07,627 --> 00:03:09,836
- [Jeremy] Orange-alicious?

74
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,667
Orange-alicious it is!
- I know!

75
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,097
Michael! Michael!

76
00:03:13,097 --> 00:03:14,447
- That's a little boring.
- Or Michael.

77
00:03:14,447 --> 00:03:16,242
Let's go with Orange-alicious.

78
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:18,290
- [Jeremy] Orange-alicious or Michael?

79
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,085
That's funny.
- Orange-alicious.

80
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:24,343
Here you go, welcome to the
family, Orange-alicious.

81
00:03:24,343 --> 00:03:26,336
Nope, no touching.

82
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,521
So, Jeremy is cutting open the pumpkin

83
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:29,850
that we're going to eat for dinner.

84
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,531
And, beside him we have
the Halloween honeydew.

85
00:03:34,531 --> 00:03:35,533
- Obviously!

86
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,846
Doesn't everyone have
a Halloween honeydew?

87
00:03:37,846 --> 00:03:40,646
- [Kendra] So we have another
story to tell you guys.

88
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:43,168
Don't cut yourself
while we tell our story.

89
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,793
- I might not look at the camera while--

90
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,231
- So, when Jeremy and I were dating,

91
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,393
we got engaged in October.

92
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:53,175
And we were both busy
working and going to school

93
00:03:53,175 --> 00:03:55,462
and anyway, Halloween night came

94
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:57,961
and we were spending it
together and we said,

95
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:59,750
"Hey, you know what would be fun?"

96
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,274
- A pumpkin!
- "Carving a pumpkin!

97
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,342
"Let's go!"

98
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:03,924
So we hopped into our car

99
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,712
and headed down to the grocery store

100
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:09,717
and there was literally
not a single pumpkin

101
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:11,055
in the grocery store.

102
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:12,015
- Yeah, nothing.

103
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:13,071
- None.

104
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,337
- So we were like, "Well
we wanna carve something."

105
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,887
So we grabbed a honeydew.

106
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:19,381
- And we carved a honeydew.

107
00:04:19,382 --> 00:04:20,670
- And it was a pleasant experience.

108
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,918
- It really was.
- It was sweet to the taste.

109
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:24,913
- It was soft and easy to cut.

110
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:26,746
- It glowed green when
we put a candle in it.

111
00:04:26,746 --> 00:04:28,982
- Which was the coolest part!

112
00:04:28,982 --> 00:04:30,892
Anyway,
- So we've continued to

113
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:32,579
carve honeydews for Halloween.

114
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:34,481
- It's really fun, we
totally recommend it.

115
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,314
- Yeah.

116
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:38,351
- And, so that's the story
of our first Halloween.

117
00:04:38,351 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
