1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:03,249
- [Jeremy] How should
we take the fire sticks?

2
00:00:03,249 --> 00:00:05,253
- Maybe I should hold them on the drive.

3
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:07,482
- [Kendra] Are you cheering
for the other team?

4
00:00:07,482 --> 00:00:08,315
Uh-oh.

5
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,081
- [Jeremy] Hey.

6
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:14,372
(laughing)

7
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:16,954
Oh, they scored!

8
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:24,741
(birds singing)

9
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:27,324
(gentle music)

10
00:00:44,037 --> 00:00:45,204
- It's a note.

11
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:49,073
- [Jeremy] From who?

12
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,568
- Mom.

13
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:52,941
- [Jeremy] Did you just wake up Cubby?

14
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,317
- Who is this?

15
00:00:54,317 --> 00:00:57,484
- [Jeremy] Mom sent you a little note.

16
00:00:58,406 --> 00:00:59,239
- Whoa.

17
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:02,198
This one's mine.

18
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:04,498
- [Jeremy] Yep, Mom wrote
you a love note, too.

19
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,331
Do you want me to read it to you?

20
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:06,792
- [Caleb] What does that say?

21
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:08,125
- [Jeremy] Dude.

22
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:13,100
- First it says that if I didn't read it,

23
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,361
you die.
- L-A-U-R-A.

24
00:01:14,361 --> 00:01:15,194
(Jeremy laughs)

25
00:01:15,194 --> 00:01:16,835
- That wouldn't have been
a very good love note.

26
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:18,585
- Dad, Dad hear this.

27
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:22,108
L-A-U-R-A.

28
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,337
- [Jeremy] There it is, do
you want me to read it to you?

29
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,170
- Mmm-mmm.

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,570
- [Jeremy] I love you.

31
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,003
You are so fun to chat with and play with.

32
00:01:33,003 --> 00:01:35,539
You are very helpful and kind.

33
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:36,386
I love you.

34
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:37,219
Mom.

35
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:40,290
- Dude you are awesome.

36
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,123
I love you.

37
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:43,395
Thanks for being my friend.

38
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,755
You are super fun.

39
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:47,506
I hope you know I'm glad we are

40
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:49,970
to have you in our family.

41
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,069
Love, Mom.

42
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,606
- [Jeremy] You read that so well buddy.

43
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:53,439
We sure love you.

44
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,662
- So last night when I
was getting ready for bed,

45
00:01:54,662 --> 00:01:55,588
I was thinking about the kids

46
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:56,444
and I thought, you know,

47
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,652
I should do little things
for them more often,

48
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,124
like write little love notes.

49
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:01,948
And then I was like,
yeah I'm tired tonight,

50
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:02,898
I'll do that another time.

51
00:02:02,898 --> 00:02:05,130
And I was like, no, I had the thought,

52
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,212
I should just do it right now.

53
00:02:06,212 --> 00:02:07,647
So I used little post-it notes

54
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,079
and wrote those little notes to them

55
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:10,241
and stuck them on the kitchen table

56
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:11,751
so they'd see them when they woke up.

57
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,552
And sometimes I have good intentions

58
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,337
and then I never make 'em happen.

59
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,269
And so I'm trying to
learn to seize the moment

60
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:19,253
and a good something is better

61
00:02:19,253 --> 00:02:20,086
than a perfect nothing.

62
00:02:20,086 --> 00:02:22,416
Like I didn't have to write
elaborate notes to them

63
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:23,672
and draw pictures.

64
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,240
Just little simple things,

65
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,488
'cause those are the things
that I can actually get done.

66
00:02:27,488 --> 00:02:30,561
(uptempo rock music)

67
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,811
Good job Isaac!

68
00:02:38,601 --> 00:02:40,505
I'm headed out to Isaac's soccer game.

69
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:41,633
Jeremy's working this morning,

70
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:42,990
and so I've got all the kids with me,

71
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,366
and we are coming to cheer for Isaac.

72
00:02:44,366 --> 00:02:45,647
And I'm excited, because
I haven't actually

73
00:02:45,647 --> 00:02:47,895
been out to a soccer game.

74
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:50,095
We're all set, ready to cheer.

75
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,328
- I don't know why I'm
all dressed in blue.

76
00:02:52,328 --> 00:02:54,278
- [Kendra] Are you cheering
for the other team?

77
00:02:54,278 --> 00:02:55,345
Uh-oh.

78
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,112
- I'm not cheering for the other team.

79
00:02:57,112 --> 00:02:58,592
- [Kendra] Are we all dressed in blue?

80
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:01,008
- We all have blue chairs.

81
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:02,278
- [Kendra] Uh-oh.

82
00:03:02,278 --> 00:03:04,692
So this is Janae's first soccer game.

83
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:06,833
She's out cheering for Isaac.

84
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:07,666
Where's Mama?

85
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:08,749
There she is.

86
00:03:10,313 --> 00:03:12,925
Good save Isaac, good block.

87
00:03:12,925 --> 00:03:13,758
- Good job guys.

88
00:03:13,758 --> 00:03:14,998
- Alright, good job.

89
00:03:14,998 --> 00:03:17,663
Next Saturday, we have team pictures.

90
00:03:17,663 --> 00:03:18,769
- [Kendra] Did you guys win?

91
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:19,602
- Yeah.

92
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:20,435
- [Kendra] Awesome.

93
00:03:20,435 --> 00:03:21,314
Good job.

94
00:03:21,314 --> 00:03:23,139
I loved watching you play.

95
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:25,035
- Can we bring fire?

96
00:03:25,035 --> 00:03:25,868
- [Jeremy] To go camping?

97
00:03:25,868 --> 00:03:26,858
- Yeah.

98
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,690
I mean fire sticks.

99
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,418
- [Jeremy] How should
we take the fire sticks?

100
00:03:32,418 --> 00:03:34,706
- Maybe I should hold them on the drive.

101
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:35,942
- [Jeremy] Would they burn you?

102
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:36,775
- No.

103
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:37,686
- [Jeremy] Why not?

104
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:40,524
- Because they are not on.

105
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:42,654
- [Jeremy] Are you talking about a match?

106
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:43,921
I think she might be
talking about a sparkler.

107
00:03:43,921 --> 00:03:47,122
- So I'm gonna hold it
carefully at the park,

108
00:03:47,122 --> 00:03:49,358
so I won't make fire.

109
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:51,858
I want to make a fire right by

110
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,879
Big fires burn people.

111
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,007
- Are you talking about matches,

112
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,310
what we use to start a birthday candle?

113
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,143
- Yeah.

114
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:05,738
- Yeah, we might have a fire
when we're out camping today,

115
00:04:05,738 --> 00:04:07,470
but we're not gonna
let little girls do it,

116
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,934
because fires are not for little girls.

117
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:13,241
- No no, I'm just saying that
I can hold them on the drive.

118
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,698
- But what if you held
something else important,

119
00:04:14,698 --> 00:04:16,365
like a water bottle?

120
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:18,321
- Um,

121
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,689
I want to bring the snack.

122
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:22,513
- You want to hold the snacks?

123
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,346
- [Laura] Yeah.

124
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:24,179
- That's a smart girl.
- We'll see what we can do.

125
00:04:24,179 --> 00:04:26,003
- [Laura] I want to hold the chips.

126
00:04:26,003 --> 00:04:26,921
- [Elise] I made a game.

127
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:28,465
- [Jeremy] Can I play?

128
00:04:28,465 --> 00:04:29,298
- [Elise] Yeah.

129
00:04:29,298 --> 00:04:30,395
- [Jeremy] Okay, so do I just pick one?

130
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,757
- Yeah, you pick a picture.

131
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,569
- [Jeremy] Let's go with the scissors.

132
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:35,736
- One two three four five.

133
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:38,905
- [Jeremy] Number one.

134
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:39,960
- One.

135
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,545
Now pick a number.

136
00:04:41,545 --> 00:04:42,962
- [Jeremy] Three.

137
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:47,985
So now I get to find out what happened?

138
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,793
- Your family got in a car crash.

139
00:04:49,793 --> 00:04:51,017
(record scratching)

140
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,416
- What kind of game is this?

141
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,969
(laughing)

142
00:04:53,969 --> 00:04:56,593
- Well it's like a game
where you go like this

143
00:04:56,593 --> 00:04:58,401
and you see the future.

144
00:04:58,401 --> 00:04:59,985
- [Jeremy] So is that the game,

145
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:02,219
just my family's gonna
die in a car accident?

146
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,410
So what happens next?

147
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,124
- You just see if your
day gets better or not.

148
00:05:07,124 --> 00:05:08,628
- [Jeremy] It could get worse,

149
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:11,698
than my family getting in a car crash?

150
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,544
- Well try again.

151
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:14,545
- Okay.

152
00:05:14,545 --> 00:05:16,589
Let's go with the scroll.

153
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,089
- One two three four five six.

154
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:21,228
Okay.

155
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:23,465
- [Jeremy] I'm curious to
see what happens this time.

156
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:26,448
- Your Mom made you do a hundred chores.

157
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:28,192
- [Jeremy] What?

158
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:29,025
Is there anything good,

159
00:05:29,025 --> 00:05:30,195
or is it all bad?

160
00:05:30,195 --> 00:05:33,278
- No, there's like a few things good.

161
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,007
- [Jeremy] Let's go with number eight.

162
00:05:36,007 --> 00:05:38,153
- It's your birthday, happy birthday!

163
00:05:38,153 --> 00:05:39,746
- Yay!

164
00:05:39,746 --> 00:05:42,155
That's a fun game Elise.

165
00:05:42,155 --> 00:05:44,644
Alright get ready, we're going camping.

166
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:45,556
- Yay.

167
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:46,993
- So two of my brothers and their families

168
00:05:46,993 --> 00:05:48,261
are out camping.

169
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:51,027
We aren't able to spend
a couple days out there,

170
00:05:51,027 --> 00:05:54,223
but wanted to go out and
have some fun with them.

171
00:05:54,223 --> 00:05:57,390
(twangy upbeat music)

172
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,728
- We're on our way out
to see Jeremy's family

173
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:05,084
who's camping, we're gonna
join them for dinner tonight

174
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,715
and we're reading on the way.

175
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:07,870
We're reading our new read aloud book,

176
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,430
which is Frindle.

177
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,709
What do you guys think of it?

178
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,014
I like it.
- It's good.

179
00:06:12,014 --> 00:06:13,038
- I like it.

180
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:13,871
- [Kendra] Remember?

181
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,234
The really fortune thing
said we'd get in an accident.

182
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:18,137
- Yeah, my family would
get in a car crash.

183
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:20,479
- [Kendra] You better
drive safe mister man.

184
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,492
- [Laura] Daddy.

185
00:06:22,492 --> 00:06:26,252
(gentle country music)

186
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,418
- [Jeremy] This is way
better than an outhouse.

187
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,668
(flushing)

188
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:33,118
- Yeah.

189
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,648
- What is this?

190
00:06:46,522 --> 00:06:48,883
- We're doing tin foil dinners tonight.

191
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:51,075
It's a family classic when we're camping.

192
00:06:51,075 --> 00:06:54,193
(groovy beat music)

193
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:55,110
Good catch.

194
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:58,380
Ooh.

195
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,291
Oh, they scored!

196
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,574
So we decided to take a scenic stroll

197
00:07:09,574 --> 00:07:10,991
down to the lake.

198
00:07:10,991 --> 00:07:13,574
(gentle music)

199
00:07:16,854 --> 00:07:18,390
- Blake, thanks for helping.

200
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,712
Thank you.

201
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,129
- [Jeremy] Hello.

202
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:27,280
Do you guys see the jet skis?

203
00:07:28,709 --> 00:07:29,757
So they have a park up here the kids

204
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:31,007
are playing at.

205
00:07:31,862 --> 00:07:33,582
Have fun Allie.

206
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:34,848
(yells)

207
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:37,431
(upbeat music)

208
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:42,625
Hey.

209
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,486
(Jeremy laughing)

210
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:47,319
Yeah.

211
00:07:52,703 --> 00:07:54,010
- [Kendra] You two sharing the stroller?

212
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:54,843
- Yeah.

213
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:00,629
- [Kendra] Heading back to the camp site.

214
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,038
- This is a rock store.

215
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:07,708
Would you like a rock?
- Did you make a rock store?

216
00:08:07,708 --> 00:08:09,947
- [Jeremy] Yes, thank you.

217
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,523
- We're giving everybody rocks.

218
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,709
- [Jeremy] Is that what
you do at a rock store.

219
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:15,140
Give away your rocks?

220
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,414
- Well we just made it up in our mind.

221
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:21,864
We just wanted to make a
rock store, because we did.

222
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:23,705
Now let's start making rocks.

223
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:26,622
- [Kendra] Oh no, who's under here?

224
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,007
(laughing)

225
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,273
- We're making a fire.

226
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:32,106
- [Jeremy] Obviously.

227
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:34,856
(knocking rocks)

228
00:08:38,397 --> 00:08:39,965
(enchanting music)

229
00:08:39,965 --> 00:08:42,957
- Let's give it some water.

230
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,789
- [Jeremy] Did you guys plant a flower?

231
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:46,429
- Mmm-mmm, we're gonna plant it.

232
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,262
- [Jeremy] And you're watering it?

233
00:08:47,262 --> 00:08:49,513
- Yeah, we're watering it.

234
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:52,346
- Let's get some more dirt for it.

235
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:56,848
Now I have to water it.

236
00:08:56,848 --> 00:08:59,888
- [Child] Oh here's another flower.

237
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:04,419
- This is gonna be a
beautiful flower for somebody.

238
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,671
And it's gonna be Mommy.

239
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,461
- [Jeremy] You gonna make it for Mommy?

240
00:09:09,461 --> 00:09:13,069
- It's gonna be beautiful for Mama.

241
00:09:13,069 --> 00:09:15,069
That was too much water.

242
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:18,868
- [Jeremy] Laura, do you
want to go get some dinner?

243
00:09:18,868 --> 00:09:19,701
Let's go.

244
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:21,566
- Okay, we have to go get dinner.

245
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,463
(tender guitar music)

246
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:28,463
- Okay, let's see, where's
the other cooked one?

247
00:09:40,026 --> 00:09:42,276
(arm fart)

248
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:46,174
- [Jeremy] You got a flashlight?

249
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:47,569
- Uh-huh, it's my flashlight.

250
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:48,713
- [Jeremy] Fun.

251
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,049
- [Woman] Apple pineapple.

252
00:09:50,049 --> 00:09:51,051
- [Jeremy] Is it apple pineapple?

253
00:09:51,051 --> 00:09:52,141
- [Man] Yep, that's what this one is.

254
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,060
- [Jeremy] Cool.

255
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,727
(guitar melody)

256
00:09:58,523 --> 00:09:59,604
How's the cobbler?

257
00:09:59,604 --> 00:10:00,437
- It's good.

258
00:10:00,437 --> 00:10:02,091
It's just hot.

259
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:04,500
So I'm gonna let it cool off right there.

260
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,979
Tell everybody that's mine.

261
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:07,590
- [Jeremy] Okay, okay.

262
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,740
How's the cobbler.

263
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,691
- Good.

264
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:11,834
- It's really good.

265
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:12,667
♫ In my back yard

266
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:13,500
♫ Don't throw your trash in my backyard

267
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,082
♫ My backyard, my backyard

268
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:16,915
♫ School

269
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:18,719
♫ Fish and chips and vinegar

270
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,245
♫ Vinegar vinegar
♫ My backyard my backyard

271
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,653
♫ Vinegar vinegar
♫ My backyard my backyard

272
00:10:21,653 --> 00:10:25,114
- [Caleb] Goodnight, J House out.

273
00:10:25,114 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat dance music)
