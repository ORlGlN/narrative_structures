1
00:00:00,206 --> 00:00:01,968
- [Kendra] Laura wants
to try out the blanket.

2
00:00:01,968 --> 00:00:04,504
(giggles)
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,709
- [Jeremy] I'll be back in a few days.

4
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:09,308
- Nobody makes Play Doh but God does.

5
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:10,277
- [Kendra] Oh, he does?

6
00:00:10,277 --> 00:00:12,860
- They are best friends.

7
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:14,488
- [Kendra] You guys are gonna
be on the five o'clock news?

8
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:15,805
- Uh-huh!
- Yes!

9
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:18,911
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:18,911 --> 00:00:20,166
- Well, today, I fly out

11
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,964
to California for a YouTube conference.

12
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,001
And everyone else is staying behind

13
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,199
so I'm saying goodbye to them

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,875
as they're getting ready to head off

15
00:00:26,875 --> 00:00:29,348
to their homeschool
enrichment program today.

16
00:00:29,348 --> 00:00:30,416
(gentle music)

17
00:00:30,416 --> 00:00:32,347
- Done, there you go.

18
00:00:32,347 --> 00:00:33,180
- [Laura] Thanks.

19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,546
- [Jeremy] Thanks for
helping her out, Elise.

20
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:35,405
- Uh-huh.

21
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:37,813
- [Jeremy] Good morning.

22
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,285
I think she's ready for a nap.

23
00:00:40,285 --> 00:00:41,730
Go get them, Nae Nae.

24
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,145
(gentle music)

25
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:48,145
(slow violin music)

26
00:00:50,295 --> 00:00:51,894
- I'm making up a song.

27
00:00:51,894 --> 00:00:53,118
- [Jeremy] All right, let's hear it.

28
00:00:53,118 --> 00:00:56,201
(gentle piano music)

29
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,373
What you working on, Elise?

30
00:01:04,373 --> 00:01:06,005
- Something for you.

31
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:06,869
(Jeremy gasps)

32
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:09,987
It says, "Dear Dad, I love you.

33
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:10,904
"And I hope

34
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:14,553
"you have a good time.

35
00:01:14,553 --> 00:01:17,418
"I wish you good things, love Elise."

36
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:19,013
- That's so sweet.

37
00:01:19,013 --> 00:01:20,596
Come here.

38
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:22,263
I love you.

39
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:23,343
I'm gonna miss you.

40
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:24,281
- [Elise] Me too.

41
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:25,662
- I'm gonna miss you too, Dad.

42
00:01:25,662 --> 00:01:27,357
- I'm gonna miss you too, Laura.

43
00:01:27,357 --> 00:01:29,090
(gentle music)

44
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,359
- This is you, Dad.

45
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,262
- [Jeremy] You drawing me?

46
00:01:31,262 --> 00:01:32,095
- Uh-huh.

47
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:33,282
- [Elise] I love you, Daddy.

48
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:34,274
- [Jeremy] I love you too.

49
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:35,582
You drawing me, Laura?

50
00:01:35,582 --> 00:01:36,415
- [Laura] Uh-huh.

51
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:38,654
- [Elise] Make sure to
draw the smiley face.

52
00:01:38,654 --> 00:01:41,737
(gentle piano music)

53
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,450
- [Jeremy] You're doing awesome!

54
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,169
Okay, you guys, it's about time to go.

55
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:54,002
- Okay.

56
00:01:54,002 --> 00:01:55,016
- I gotta say goodbye to you.

57
00:01:55,016 --> 00:01:55,849
Hugs.

58
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,682
- [Isaac] Bye, Dad.

59
00:01:56,682 --> 00:01:57,817
- [Jeremy] From the bugs.

60
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,233
I love you guys.

61
00:01:59,233 --> 00:02:00,134
- [Isaac] I love you too.

62
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:02,656
- I'll be back in a few days.

63
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:05,113
You be good to Mom, okay?

64
00:02:05,113 --> 00:02:06,509
What's this, Laura?

65
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:08,559
- [Laura] It's me and you.

66
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,610
- [Jeremy] You finished it?

67
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,443
- [Laura] Yeah.

68
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:12,349
- [Jeremy] Is that me on an airplane?

69
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:15,078
- Nope.
(record scratches)

70
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:16,245
This is a bed.

71
00:02:20,504 --> 00:02:22,690
And that is a boat.

72
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,523
- [Jeremy] A boat.

73
00:02:23,523 --> 00:02:25,856
So, what does it say, Laura?

74
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:37,811
I love it, thank you.

75
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,978
Come here, oh, I love you.

76
00:02:41,313 --> 00:02:42,794
- How are you, baby girl?

77
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,559
Oh, doing some yoga this morning?

78
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,409
(Janae babbles)
Hi, hi.

79
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,783
(chuckles) Hi.

80
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:52,104
With the big kids all
at school this morning,

81
00:02:52,104 --> 00:02:53,385
I'm hanging out with Janae.

82
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:56,370
And I'm also working on
some of the sewing projects.

83
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,074
As I've been sewing for the first time,

84
00:02:58,074 --> 00:02:59,956
in a really long time.

85
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:00,892
It's been a good reminder to me

86
00:03:00,892 --> 00:03:03,630
about perfectionism and perspective.

87
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,528
When you're up close
on your sewing project,

88
00:03:05,528 --> 00:03:06,813
everything looks uneven.

89
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:08,917
Like, "Oh, I made this stitch
a little bit sideways."

90
00:03:08,917 --> 00:03:11,239
Or, "Oh, I didn't iron this crease right."

91
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,946
Or, "Oh, I didn't cut it quite square."

92
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:15,215
But when you hold it up and away from you,

93
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:16,678
it looks like a beautiful blanket.

94
00:03:16,678 --> 00:03:18,910
And I need that reminder so often in life.

95
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,072
Like, up close, when
I'm looking so closely

96
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:23,943
at like my kids' behavior
or my marriage or my house,

97
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,797
I'm like (groans), or my body.

98
00:03:25,797 --> 00:03:26,980
Like, it's like (groans).

99
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,876
"I don't know if I like what I see."

100
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,453
But when I back up and you
look at it from further away,

101
00:03:30,453 --> 00:03:31,617
then you can see the beauty

102
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,442
and the whole picture more completely.

103
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:34,447
Anyway, that's what I'm thinking

104
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:35,280
while I'm sewing this morning.

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,922
And hanging out with this cutie.

106
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:37,973
(Janae squeals)

107
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,882
(squeals) Hi.

108
00:03:40,882 --> 00:03:42,936
Oh, we love you Nae Nae bug.

109
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:45,926
And here's Laura's
blanket, it's almost done.

110
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:48,759
(uplifting music)

111
00:03:57,259 --> 00:03:58,328
This blanket is almost done.

112
00:03:58,328 --> 00:04:00,474
I'm going to save the rest of it

113
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:02,239
to finish up with Laura this afternoon.

114
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,428
That was quite the shriek, little girl.

115
00:04:04,428 --> 00:04:05,836
Janae is starting to learn to squeal.

116
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:06,865
And there's somebody at the door.

117
00:04:06,865 --> 00:04:09,087
Okay, the doorbell was my
online grocery shopping.

118
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,584
And I think I say this every
week when our groceries come.

119
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:13,243
But it's because I love it so much.

120
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:15,306
I just can't contain
my excitement about it.

121
00:04:15,306 --> 00:04:19,223
Online grocery shopping
is the best thing ever.

122
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,034
And so are poopy diapers,

123
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:24,785
which I think she has a poopy diaper.

124
00:04:24,785 --> 00:04:25,765
Let's go change her.

125
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,731
Shall we finish up your blanket together?

126
00:04:28,731 --> 00:04:30,100
How was preschool today?

127
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,274
- Great, I got my own Play Doh.

128
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,197
- [Kendra] Show us your Play Doh.

129
00:04:34,197 --> 00:04:37,062
You own Play Doh, what
color did you choose?

130
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:37,895
- Pink!

131
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,422
- [Kendra] And what did you
learn about in preschool?

132
00:04:39,422 --> 00:04:41,505
- Well, I learned about--

133
00:04:42,773 --> 00:04:44,606
I just learned about--

134
00:04:47,124 --> 00:04:50,374
- [Kendra] Are you getting your papers?

135
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,413
- Shapes!

136
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,129
- [Kendra] You learned about shapes?

137
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,370
Oh, what's your favorite shape?

138
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,605
- This one is the pink one.

139
00:04:58,605 --> 00:05:00,040
- [Kendra] Yeah and what is it?

140
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,873
- Heart!

141
00:05:00,873 --> 00:05:02,738
- [Kendra] And what is this in your hands?

142
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:03,571
- Play Doh.

143
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,534
- [Kendra] Did you make it?

144
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:08,951
- No, nobody makes Play Doh but God does.

145
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:11,486
- [Kendra] Oh, he does?

146
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:14,193
Are you sure about that?
- Yes!

147
00:05:14,193 --> 00:05:15,601
- So, silly Laura is going to help me

148
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:17,506
finish up her blanket right now.

149
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:18,658
And she had to put the Play Doh

150
00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,162
right next to us so it'd be safe.

151
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,568
So, there's the Play Doh.

152
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:23,318
Shall we finish this?

153
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,528
Yep-a-dee-dep!

154
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:28,111
(gentle music)

155
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,717
- All we have to do is vacuum it.

156
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:37,212
- [Kendra] Now we just have to vacuum it?

157
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,297
- (giggles) Yeah.

158
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,751
- [Kendra] It's already done,
Laura, it's all finished.

159
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,787
- Oh, can I lay it down?

160
00:05:42,787 --> 00:05:44,700
- [Kendra] Here, why don't
you lay it down on the carpet?

161
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,342
Did you make it?
- Yep.

162
00:05:46,342 --> 00:05:47,855
It was kind of easy.

163
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,200
- [Kendra] It was kind of easy?

164
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,033
- [Laura] Yeah.

165
00:05:50,033 --> 00:05:51,913
- [Kendra] There it is,
you made this blanket.

166
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:52,746
- Yep!

167
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,507
- [Kendra] Is it a big kid size?

168
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:02,795
- Yeah, I think so.

169
00:06:02,795 --> 00:06:04,061
- [Kendra] Are you happy with it?

170
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:04,894
- Yes.

171
00:06:04,894 --> 00:06:07,196
- [Kendra] Look, it's pink and black.

172
00:06:07,196 --> 00:06:09,250
Laura wants to try out the blanket.

173
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,162
(giggles)

174
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,868
Ready, set, (gasps) there.

175
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:16,868
- (laughs) So cozy.

176
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:20,304
- [Kendra] Do you like it?

177
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:21,137
- Yeah!

178
00:06:21,137 --> 00:06:21,990
- [Kendra] You did a great job.

179
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,788
Shall we give this to a little friend?

180
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:25,183
- Yeah, today.

181
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:27,157
- Today, I wish we could today.

182
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:28,659
Okay, this is hilarious.

183
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,372
This is a little behind the
scene moments into our life.

184
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:32,641
It is currently nine minutes

185
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,507
until Jeremy needs to
leave on an airplane.

186
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:36,467
He is downstairs in the office,

187
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:38,405
is sitting there in his underwear,

188
00:06:38,405 --> 00:06:40,260
with shaving cream on his face

189
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,331
because he still needs
to shave and shower.

190
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,500
His bag is not packed.

191
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,806
His laptop bag is not packed up.

192
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:47,725
And yeah, nine minutes.

193
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:49,529
So, I'm trying to hurry
and pack the bag for him.

194
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,984
And he's got to shower.

195
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,077
This guy, he lives life
so much to the fullest.

196
00:06:54,077 --> 00:06:55,938
And he's always trying to pack so much in

197
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:58,201
that sometimes his life
is full to overflowing.

198
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,330
Well, he's amazing.

199
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,843
10 minutes later, here he is.

200
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,333
All ready to go, his bag is packed.

201
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,323
Can you smile for me?

202
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:05,743
- I'm not quite all
the way ready (laughs).

203
00:07:05,743 --> 00:07:07,470
- Okay, all right, well, he's headed off.

204
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,489
He's going to be gone for a few days

205
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:09,342
and we're gonna miss him.

206
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:11,458
- Tell the kids I love
them and I love you.

207
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:12,291
- See you soon.

208
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:13,742
- See you.
- Fly safe.

209
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:16,325
(gentle music)

210
00:07:18,787 --> 00:07:20,797
All right, well, Jeremy
made it off to his flight.

211
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:22,182
And I came to pick up the kids from school

212
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:23,514
so I'm sitting here in the car line

213
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:25,313
and I'm kind of enjoying it right now.

214
00:07:25,313 --> 00:07:27,172
Just slowly moving forward.

215
00:07:27,172 --> 00:07:28,949
But with the rain and
the windshield wipers,

216
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,407
it's just kind of cozy in here.

217
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:31,687
It also helps that the little girls

218
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:33,587
are both napping so it's quiet.

219
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,854
I was just realizing that
it won't be quiet for long

220
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:37,923
because I'm picking up
all three of the big kids.

221
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:40,016
And I know it's gonna
feel like an explosion.

222
00:07:40,016 --> 00:07:41,661
They'll open the door,
and their backpacks,

223
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,973
and their lunch boxes.

224
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:45,147
And they're be excited to
tell me all about their day.

225
00:07:45,147 --> 00:07:46,493
And I'm excited to hear about it.

226
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:47,926
But the contrast is interesting.

227
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,264
Like, the quiet of the car.

228
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:51,529
And then, the kids.

229
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:55,696
(gentle music)
(rain tapping)

230
00:07:56,804 --> 00:07:58,402
- We were the last in class!

231
00:07:58,402 --> 00:08:00,029
- [Kendra] I know, I was running late.

232
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:01,384
(Kendra laughs)

233
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:03,352
- I have really good information for you.

234
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,874
- I have good information.

235
00:08:04,874 --> 00:08:05,716
- [Kendra] Oh, my goodness.

236
00:08:05,716 --> 00:08:08,110
- Somebody on the news, he came.

237
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:12,037
And he's talking at five o'clock tonight.

238
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:15,000
And telling everybody that he came here.

239
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,833
- [Kendra] What?

240
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,978
- There's gonna be a picture of us.

241
00:08:17,978 --> 00:08:19,092
- On channel nine.

242
00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,433
- [Kendra] On the five o'clock news?

243
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,991
You guys are gonna be on
the five o'clock news?

244
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,019
- Uh-huh!
- Yes!

245
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:24,852
- [Kendra] Whoa.

246
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:25,777
- On channel nine.

247
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:26,782
- [Kendra] Whoa.

248
00:08:26,782 --> 00:08:27,615
- Yes.

249
00:08:27,615 --> 00:08:28,606
- [Kendra] Was it like an assembly?

250
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:29,439
- Yes.

251
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,772
- Yeah, it was Brian Buzby from weather.

252
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:36,118
- So, I'm just going through security.

253
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:39,666
I'm remembering the time that
I left my laptop at security.

254
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,644
That was embarrassing.

255
00:08:40,644 --> 00:08:43,227
(gentle music)

256
00:08:58,213 --> 00:08:59,173
So, I don't know if I said this.

257
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:02,251
But my brother, Brent, is
actually going with us, as well.

258
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:05,164
We're going to VidSummit
for a couple days.

259
00:09:05,164 --> 00:09:06,727
I'm excited.

260
00:09:06,727 --> 00:09:09,310
(upbeat music)

261
00:09:30,978 --> 00:09:32,793
So, we're waiting for our shuttle.

262
00:09:32,793 --> 00:09:35,192
It's beautiful weather here in California.

263
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,775
(upbeat music)

264
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,252
(gentle music)

265
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:48,915
- They are best friends.

266
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,897
Today, Bitsy--

267
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:53,539
- Well, we had an awesome afternoon.

268
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,550
After school, the kids and I
went over to a friend's house

269
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,984
and we hung out there all afternoon.

270
00:09:56,984 --> 00:09:58,956
It was so nice 'cause I
got to talk to my friend

271
00:09:58,956 --> 00:10:00,984
and the kids all got to
play with their friends.

272
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:02,513
Anyway, we had dinner with them.

273
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:03,698
And now, it's bedtime.

274
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,432
See you guys tomorrow,
J House out, good night.

275
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:08,095
- [Jeremy] No (laughs)!

276
00:10:08,095 --> 00:10:09,452
- [Kendra] Is your room really messy?

277
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:10,285
- [Jeremy] You gonna give it

278
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,868
to little kids who need blankets?

279
00:10:11,868 --> 00:00:00,000
(Jeremy laughs)
(kids cheer)
