1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:02,155
- Happy New Year!

2
00:00:02,155 --> 00:00:03,203
Good morning.

3
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,283
This morning we decided
to start the new year

4
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:06,922
with new hair cuts for the boys.

5
00:00:06,922 --> 00:00:08,675
It has been desperately needed.

6
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,067
So I'm going to cut
Caleb and Isaac's hair.

7
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:13,723
And Jeremy is going
into work this morning.

8
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:16,306
(bright music)

9
00:00:20,578 --> 00:00:22,235
Let's take your shirt off.

10
00:00:22,235 --> 00:00:23,091
- Why?

11
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,563
- So you don't get hair on it.

12
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:26,480
- And why my pants too?

13
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:29,027
- So you don't get hair all over 'em.

14
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:30,771
Okay, you sit right here.

15
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:32,938
(buzzing)

16
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,978
I know why is that not working.

17
00:00:38,308 --> 00:00:40,403
Our clippers broke.

18
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:42,434
So I can't cut their hair this morning.

19
00:00:42,434 --> 00:00:43,267
Dang it.

20
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:44,915
So I went into my bedroom to tell Jeremy,

21
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:46,274
who was getting ready for work,

22
00:00:46,274 --> 00:00:47,491
that the clippers weren't working

23
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:49,522
and that I wasn't going to
be able to cut their hair.

24
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:51,859
And Elise comes running into me to tell me

25
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,915
that Caleb was cutting his own hair.

26
00:00:53,915 --> 00:00:55,834
Here's some of his hair.

27
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:57,915
And Caleb what did you do?

28
00:00:57,915 --> 00:00:59,515
Oh, there's a patch.

29
00:00:59,515 --> 00:01:00,899
There's a patch out right there.

30
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,465
And it looks to be that there's
a patch out in the front.

31
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,177
Apparently Jeremy was
able to fix the clippers,

32
00:01:06,177 --> 00:01:07,953
so we're going to resume as planned.

33
00:01:07,953 --> 00:01:10,249
Seriously people, I'm really
hoping that this is not

34
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:12,385
an omen of how our
entire year is gonna go.

35
00:01:12,385 --> 00:01:13,577
Because this morning,

36
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:15,161
hmm I'm not feelin' it.

37
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:17,328
(buzzing)

38
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:19,513
Now that his hair is shorter,

39
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:22,691
you can actually see the
spot where he cut it.

40
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,024
Do you see that?

41
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:27,505
I don't know what to do.

42
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:30,041
From far away, you can't really tell.

43
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:31,124
But up close,

44
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:35,049
there's definitely a little bald spot.

45
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:37,249
Should I just buzz it?

46
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,126
It is a two sucker sort of hair cut.

47
00:01:40,126 --> 00:01:40,959
- Hello, camera.

48
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,102
(buzzing)

49
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,209
- I got two suckers, camera.

50
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,870
- So Isaac actually requested a buzz cut.

51
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:49,037
(buzzing)

52
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,288
- Whoa!

53
00:01:58,184 --> 00:02:01,207
- [Mom] Wow! That's a lot of hair.

54
00:02:01,207 --> 00:02:03,540
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,

55
00:02:05,486 --> 00:02:07,819
J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S

56
00:02:11,918 --> 00:02:14,199
- [Jeremy] Are you guys all
eating right by each other?

57
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,032
- Mmm hmm.

58
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:16,628
- [Jeremy] Silly gooses.

59
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:19,013
Well Mom's over here
having some awesomeness.

60
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,846
What is this?

61
00:02:19,846 --> 00:02:21,156
- This is the best salad ever.

62
00:02:21,156 --> 00:02:23,482
I'm pretty excited about it.

63
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:24,577
So there's

64
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,265
lettuce, broccoli, sweet peas, carrots,

65
00:02:28,265 --> 00:02:29,848
sweet maple turkey,

66
00:02:30,745 --> 00:02:32,578
smoked Gouda, which is

67
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:34,672
one of my favorites.

68
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:35,751
Did I say that right?

69
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,927
Anyway, and cashews and walnuts.

70
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:39,760
- [Jeremy] Yum.

71
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,722
- With a raspberry walnut
vinaigrette dressing.

72
00:02:42,722 --> 00:02:45,103
Happy New Year right?

73
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,151
- Leftover Chinese food,

74
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,574
it's one of the few foods that I like

75
00:02:48,574 --> 00:02:51,074
better the second time around.

76
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,473
Mmm, so good.

77
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:58,933
- Alright, so I came
up to my office, today.

78
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,433
I wanted to review

79
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:02,846
kind of my work load and what happened

80
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,093
this last year at work.

81
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,942
And think about what I'm
wanting for the next year.

82
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:08,534
And just organizing myself.

83
00:03:08,534 --> 00:03:10,821
That's always an important
thing for me to stay,

84
00:03:10,821 --> 00:03:13,782
to come up and make sure
that I feel organized

85
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:15,909
on each of my cases,
for each of my clients.

86
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,543
And it's hard to do that
on a normal working day.

87
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:22,364
It's nice to just spend some
time just focusing on that.

88
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:25,985
So, I'm glad to have a couple
hours up here for that today.

89
00:03:25,985 --> 00:03:27,665
Alright, so I just got home
and the kids are screaming

90
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:28,818
about something they built.

91
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:30,716
I am not used to bald children.

92
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,385
- [Child] We built something.

93
00:03:32,385 --> 00:03:33,218
- [Jeremy] Did you guys build something?

94
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:34,135
What is it?

95
00:03:38,815 --> 00:03:40,503
- It's a rocket ship or something.

96
00:03:40,503 --> 00:03:41,743
- [Jeremy] Okay, so what do
you got going on in here?

97
00:03:41,743 --> 00:03:43,471
What are the cups for?

98
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:44,888
- [Child] They're the buttons.

99
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:45,839
- [Jeremy] These are the buttons.

100
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,503
- And I have those.

101
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:48,336
- [Jeremy] Wow!

102
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:49,295
- And can we show you how

103
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,360
we do it?

104
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,351
- [Jeremy] Let's see it.

105
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:53,839
Oh, it's like a bobsled.

106
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,081
- [Mom] That's exactly what I thought.

107
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:57,144
- But, for real.

108
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:00,760
- So Isaac was telling me
that this is going to be

109
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,231
the very first ever by
kids built electric powered

110
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,615
thing a majig.

111
00:04:05,615 --> 00:04:07,119
And so they got all this done

112
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:09,510
and then he looked at me and he said,

113
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,951
they got all this done, then
he looked at me and said,

114
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:13,967
"Mom, now we just need to
figure out electricity."

115
00:04:13,967 --> 00:04:15,831
- [Jeremy] K, we got to
get this thing powered.

116
00:04:15,831 --> 00:04:18,414
- So we just have to use those.

117
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:23,311
- [Jeremy] Oh, if we can just plug it in.

118
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:24,870
Okay, we'll figure that out.

119
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,975
(laughing)

120
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,038
- [Child] We to turn on this.

121
00:04:27,038 --> 00:04:28,070
- But they took this box

122
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,787
and they completely unassembled it

123
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:31,654
and then they colored it

124
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:32,637
and they put up those cups

125
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:33,987
and then they reassembled it like this.

126
00:04:33,987 --> 00:04:35,643
All I did was hand them tape.

127
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:36,859
This is...

128
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,692
- [Jeremy] Their creation.

129
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:39,267
- Yep.

130
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:41,604
- [Jeremy] We found a good babysitter.

131
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:42,939
- Yay!

132
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:43,915
It's date night.

133
00:04:43,915 --> 00:04:44,926
- We're going to go on a little date.

134
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,188
That was one of our
goals for the new year.

135
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:47,021
So we're rockin' it.

136
00:04:47,021 --> 00:04:47,854
- Yes!

137
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:50,249
- Have fun.

138
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:54,225
Caleb, don't destroy anything
while we're gone, okay?

139
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,145
He's done a lot of damage to this house

140
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:58,089
in the past, so.

141
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,784
Okay, we're here at 54th Street Grill.

142
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,096
And one of the hard things
about grills like this

143
00:05:04,096 --> 00:05:06,346
is there's a TV back there,

144
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,920
and it's showing the best
baseball highlights of the year.

145
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,753
Then there's one over there

146
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,993
and it's showing the NFL top highlights.

147
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:15,743
Then there's this TV,

148
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:19,360
and it's showing a bowl game.

149
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,744
And I'm supposed to be
paying attention to this.

150
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:23,544
- It's date night, come on.

151
00:05:23,544 --> 00:05:25,254
- And she's like talking
about all this important stuff

152
00:05:25,254 --> 00:05:26,754
and I'm just like.

153
00:05:29,119 --> 00:05:30,598
It's hard.

154
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:31,750
- He does alright at it though.

155
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,302
I'm so excited to be on a date.

156
00:05:33,302 --> 00:05:35,694
Like it's been a while
since Laura's been having

157
00:05:35,694 --> 00:05:36,830
a hard time with babysitters,

158
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,102
we haven't been able to get out much,

159
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:40,870
so I'm like really excited to be kid free.

160
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,391
- Yeah, I gotta get back
to focusing on Kendra now.

161
00:05:44,391 --> 00:05:45,334
Kendra just had a helpful idea,

162
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:47,647
that we just switch seats.

163
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,397
There's no TV's on that side, so.

164
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:53,151
There we go, much easier.

165
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,919
- So I ordered a steak and steamed veggies

166
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,071
and garlic bread.

167
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,839
We did like a three
course meal for two deal.

168
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:03,015
Where we got an appetizer

169
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:05,932
and two meals and a chocolate cake.

170
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,233
- [Jeremy] So we had to get it to go.

171
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:13,303
- But I had to sneak a bite
because it's my favorite,

172
00:06:13,303 --> 00:06:14,920
but we need to go get our kids.

173
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,135
- Yeah, we're hoping that
the ice cream doesn't melt

174
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:18,991
because it's so cold outside.

175
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:20,719
It's like 20 degrees out there.

176
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:22,496
- It'll be fine.

177
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,096
- [Jeremy] Let's do it.

178
00:06:24,096 --> 00:06:26,429
We're back to our bald boys.

179
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,587
Laura,

180
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:31,107

181
00:06:32,784 --> 00:06:33,867

182
00:06:36,777 --> 00:06:38,578

183
00:06:38,578 --> 00:06:39,833

184
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,717

Hi, hi.

187
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,641
- Alright, so date night went well.

188
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,569
It was so nice to be able to talk.

We have so much to plan
and our dreams for 2015

nice to be able to connect.

00:06:56,337 --> 00:06:58,760
And the kids did great
with their babysitters.

192
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,609
And we have an extra child in the back.

193
00:07:01,609 --> 00:07:02,442
Where is she?

194
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:03,275
Ah, there she is.

195
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:04,108

196
00:07:04,108 --> 00:07:04,941

00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,570
