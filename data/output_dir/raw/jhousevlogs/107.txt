1
00:00:00,312 --> 00:00:02,003
So Janae just said her very first word.

2
00:00:02,003 --> 00:00:03,752
That one looks pretty cute.

3
00:00:03,752 --> 00:00:05,303
Thank you.

4
00:00:05,303 --> 00:00:07,093
So I have my hair down today.

5
00:00:07,093 --> 00:00:08,527
My whole family's a little confused.

6
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:11,694
(jangly upbeat music)

7
00:00:17,814 --> 00:00:20,481
(uptempo music)

8
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:38,783
- [Jeremy] It's like dance cleaning.

9
00:00:38,783 --> 00:00:39,941
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy ")

10
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:41,024
Oh very nice.

11
00:00:45,389 --> 00:00:47,972
(bright music)

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:58,993
She's asleep now, shhh.

13
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:03,130
So with the weather getting colder,

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:06,609
it is time to go through
the growin' bin, right?

15
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,509
What size clothes are we gonna look for?

16
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:10,172
Four year old ones.

17
00:01:10,172 --> 00:01:11,020
Four year old ones?

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,037
'Cause how old are you gonna be soon?

19
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:13,870
Four.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,703
And then five.

21
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:15,536
And then what?

22
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:16,628
I don't know.

23
00:01:16,628 --> 00:01:17,461
(laughs)

24
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,708
- [Kendra] So pretty
much all of Laura's pants

25
00:01:18,708 --> 00:01:20,675
look like this right now.

26
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:21,508
Yeah.

27
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:22,341
- [Kendra] You've gotten taller.

28
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:23,174
Show me how tall you are.

29
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:25,657
Whoa, whoa that is very tall.

30
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:26,711
So we gotta get the clothes

31
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,487
out of your drawers that
don't fit you any more

32
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:29,440
and save them for who?

33
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,273
Nae Nae.

34
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:32,407
And then we're gonna go through this bin

35
00:01:32,407 --> 00:01:34,215
and see which clothes fit you.

36
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:37,326
So step one is to go through
Laura's very messy drawers.

37
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:38,764
What happened in this drawer?

38
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:39,889
(playful music)

39
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:41,071
I messed up it.

40
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:42,836
- [Kendra] That one is too little for you,

41
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:45,539
I think we need to save it for Janae.

42
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,015
I wanted to keep it.

43
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,290
- [Kendra] Let's see how short it is.

44
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,746
You got that when you were two.

45
00:01:51,746 --> 00:01:53,746
I think it's too little now.

46
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:55,202
But you can find some new stuff

47
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:57,483
in the growing box, okay?

48
00:01:57,483 --> 00:01:59,495
So these look really short.

49
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,983
Wait a minute, these are size nine months.

50
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:02,352
These are Janae's.

51
00:02:02,352 --> 00:02:03,185
Oh.

52
00:02:03,185 --> 00:02:04,018
- [Kendra] Down at the bottom,

53
00:02:04,018 --> 00:02:05,719
we found Laura's missing necklace.

54
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,943
Well we're surrounded by piles of clothes.

55
00:02:08,943 --> 00:02:13,757
Ooh, you're getting kinda
almost too big for these ones.

56
00:02:13,757 --> 00:02:15,965
(bright music)

57
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:17,132
C-c-c-cutie.

58
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,186
- [Kendra] I think you put
the shirt on backwards.

59
00:02:20,186 --> 00:02:21,345
I did.

60
00:02:21,345 --> 00:02:23,431
(bright music)

61
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,264
Church shoes.

62
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:26,923
- [Kendra] You want to try 'em on?

63
00:02:26,923 --> 00:02:29,296
Ooh they are still a little bit big.

64
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,403
And then what happens when you're four?

65
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,803
Pre-school with the big kids.

66
00:02:32,803 --> 00:02:34,590
(bright music)

67
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,224
- [Kendra] I remember
that was Elise's favorite

68
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:39,057
pair of pajamas when she was four.

69
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,464
That one looks pretty cute.

70
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:46,006
Thank you.

71
00:02:46,006 --> 00:02:48,071
(laughing)

72
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:49,856
That one is adorable.

73
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:52,832
Put your arms up in
the air, and let's see.

74
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:55,286
Thank you Mom for buying these.

75
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:57,214
- [Kendra] They're hand
me downs from Lise.

76
00:02:57,214 --> 00:02:59,108
Are you excited to wear your
new four year old clothes?

77
00:02:59,108 --> 00:02:59,941
Yeah.

78
00:02:59,941 --> 00:03:03,191
- [Kendra] It's fun to get new clothes.

79
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,358
You love four year old stuff.

80
00:03:05,358 --> 00:03:06,191
Yeah.

81
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,385
(beeping)

82
00:03:07,385 --> 00:03:09,480
- [Kendra] What are you doing in here?

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,058
Just weighing.

84
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,175
- [Kendra] You built a scale?

85
00:03:13,175 --> 00:03:14,926
Alright Caleb, how do you weigh something?

86
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:17,429
So if I want to do this,

87
00:03:17,429 --> 00:03:18,557
I could do these two.

88
00:03:18,557 --> 00:03:20,774
See this one weighs more.

89
00:03:20,774 --> 00:03:22,217
- [Kendra] I see.

90
00:03:22,217 --> 00:03:23,992
And then maybe we could add a few

91
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:26,008
of these little stuff

92
00:03:26,008 --> 00:03:29,397
to this and see what it might do.

93
00:03:29,397 --> 00:03:33,158
- [Kendra] Whoa, you figured
out how to equalize it.

94
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:34,318
Wait, you took 'em off

95
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:35,825
and it still stayed.

96
00:03:35,825 --> 00:03:37,408
How did it do that?

97
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:42,036
Ah-ha, so where you
put it affects it, huh.

98
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,212
Caleb thanks for showing us that,

99
00:03:43,212 --> 00:03:44,531
that was really cool.

100
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:46,025
Good luck weighing stuff.

101
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,608
(upbeat music)

102
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,367
- [Jared] So Elise said that
a friend of hers at school

103
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,806
put bananas in her sandwich,

104
00:03:52,806 --> 00:03:55,111
so we thought we would try it.

105
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:58,528
Alright, let me know what you guys think.

106
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:01,823
It's good.

107
00:04:01,823 --> 00:04:03,051
- [Jeremy] It's kinda different, huh?

108
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:04,802
The flavor of the banana

109
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:07,578
really took out the flavor
of the peanut butter

110
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:09,707
and I love peanut butter.

111
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,443
So I have my hair down today

112
00:04:12,443 --> 00:04:14,443
and I very very rarely do that.

113
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,409
So much so that my whole
family's a little confused.

114
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:19,572
- [Jeremy] You look so different today.

115
00:04:19,572 --> 00:04:20,469
Well thank you.

116
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,425
- [Jeremy] With your hair, you have hair.

117
00:04:22,425 --> 00:04:23,258
I do.

118
00:04:23,258 --> 00:04:24,994
The kids are like, you have hair.

119
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:27,746
It's down and Janae
keeps like touching it.

120
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:29,848
It's just funny, because
I always wear it up.

121
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:30,976
So question for you,

122
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,525
do you usually wear your hair down or up?

123
00:04:32,525 --> 00:04:33,914
I have my hair down some days

124
00:04:33,914 --> 00:04:36,433
and I have my hair up sometimes.

125
00:04:36,433 --> 00:04:38,599
I usually wear my hair up.

126
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:39,432
- [Kendra] Yeah?

127
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,439
I let mine hang down.

128
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:43,695
So Janae just said her very first word.

129
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:45,007
I was laying here on the ground

130
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:46,175
and she was crawling around me

131
00:04:46,175 --> 00:04:47,243
and she crawled right up to me

132
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,576
and patted me and said Mama.

133
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:52,620
Didn't you, didn't you say Mama?

134
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,614
- [Elise] Mama.

135
00:04:54,614 --> 00:04:56,159
- [Laura] Mama!

136
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,022
I saw her say Mama.

137
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:59,182
It was like Mama.

138
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,332
It was not just random babbling,

139
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:03,137
like she knew what she was saying.

140
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,258
Mama.

141
00:05:04,258 --> 00:05:07,558
Okay now let's let her talk.

142
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,558
Nothing, nothing at all.

143
00:05:10,494 --> 00:05:12,326
I swear she said it guys.

144
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:15,083
(laughing)

145
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:16,768
(Janae babbling)

146
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:18,185
Oh she's talking.

147
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,973
- [Laura] Dada Mama.

148
00:05:22,832 --> 00:05:23,665
Well I still have a lot of work to do,

149
00:05:23,665 --> 00:05:25,136
but we've made a lot of progress.

150
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:27,158
I've got a pile of stuff to donate,

151
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:27,991
that Laura grew out of,

152
00:05:27,991 --> 00:05:29,062
and then some of the stuff
that she grew out of,

153
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,117
we're gonna save for Janae,

154
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,522
and so I've got a pile of that

155
00:05:31,522 --> 00:05:32,760
that I'm gonna put in these bins.

156
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,961
And I went through her drawers.

157
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:34,794
It's amazing what you can find

158
00:05:34,794 --> 00:05:36,183
in a three year old's drawers.

159
00:05:36,183 --> 00:05:38,701
But look how much more
organized they look now.

160
00:05:38,701 --> 00:05:39,534
It's just interesting.

161
00:05:39,534 --> 00:05:40,683
I grew up with hand me down clothes,

162
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:42,375
Jeremy grew up with a lot
of hand me down clothes

163
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:43,708
and I like that.

164
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,293
I like that it teaches our kids

165
00:05:46,293 --> 00:05:48,512
that you don't have to
have things brand new

166
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:50,680
to have them work and be functional.

167
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,303
The kids are really happy
with hand me down clothes,

168
00:05:52,303 --> 00:05:54,252
so I think we're gonna enjoy
it for as long as it lasts.

169
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:56,066
That might not work when they get older.

170
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,255
We're going to do that for now.

171
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,247
This is my favorite vegetable,

172
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,630
my favorite fruit, my favorite bread

173
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,442
and my favorite kind of noodles.

174
00:06:03,442 --> 00:06:04,589
Same with me.
And they're mine.

175
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:05,575
- [Jeremy] Well good.

176
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:07,877
We should make this for dinner more often.

177
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:09,562
(lively music)

178
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:11,783
Isaac and I are working on
his Pinewood Derby tonight.

179
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:12,915
If you remember last year,

180
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,090
we had a scare with the saw.

181
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,610
(saw buzzing)

182
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,676
(yelling)

183
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:19,611
Get back.

184
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,157
The blade actually broke and snapped

185
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:23,446
and kind of scared everybody.

186
00:06:23,446 --> 00:06:24,373
- [Jeremy] Do you remember that Isaac?

187
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:25,206
Yeah.

188
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:26,282
Yeah, that was scary.

189
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:27,776
So hopefully tonight
goes a little bit better.

190
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:28,982
So since we don't have the equipment,

191
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:30,779
Mike, he goes to church with us,

192
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:33,155
he's helping us, he has the saws

193
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:35,523
and a cool little workshop down here,

194
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,642
of a bunch of equipment,

195
00:06:36,642 --> 00:06:39,301
and he's gonna help us
cut the Pinewood Derby

196
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:40,634
right to design.

197
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,819
(jangly string music)

198
00:06:58,514 --> 00:06:59,842
Right there.

199
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:02,602
- [Mike] That's not really
the right drum for that,

200
00:07:02,602 --> 00:07:03,435
but we'll put this one on.

201
00:07:03,435 --> 00:07:05,964
(machinery grinding)

202
00:07:05,964 --> 00:07:08,413
(lively rock music)

203
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:11,413
(machinery buzzing)

204
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,117
- [Jeremy] Well we can just
take sand paper to it at home.

205
00:07:25,663 --> 00:07:27,253
(drill buzzing)

206
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,884
You made a hole, make it deeper.

207
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,179
Watch that,

208
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:34,764
good thing you got your goggles on.

209
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:36,075
- [Mike] Is it hot?

210
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:37,072
Yeah.

211
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:37,905
- [Mike] It's hot isn't it.

212
00:07:37,905 --> 00:07:38,738
- [Jeremy] The friction.

213
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:39,571
- [Mike] The friction.

214
00:07:39,571 --> 00:07:41,610
The smell of the wood is so good.

215
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,188
(dramatic guitar flourish)

216
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:46,171
Nae Nae's dancing.

217
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,575
- [Kendra] She's into it.

218
00:07:47,575 --> 00:07:48,825
- [Jeremy] Woo!

219
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:51,609
- [Kendra] Woo!

220
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:53,374
(Janae laughing)

221
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:55,163
- [Jeremy] There it is.

222
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:55,996
Woo!

223
00:07:57,003 --> 00:07:59,003
Get that knee into it.

224
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:03,702
She's excited.

225
00:08:03,702 --> 00:08:06,669
(laughing)

226
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:08,321
(Janae squealing)

227
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,154
Woo!

228
00:08:09,154 --> 00:08:10,616
We did a 10 minute family clean up

229
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,192
which ends with a dance party
and a clean living room.

- [Jeremy] There's the Nae Nae.

239
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:38,721
Everybody do the Nae Nae.

240
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:41,631

00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,254
Yeah.

242
00:08:43,255 --> 00:08:44,241

243
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,805
- [Jeremy] It's the Nae Nae.

244
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:46,638
Look Mama.

00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:48,859

247
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:51,259
- [Jeremy] Super Laura.
(tropical beat music)

248
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,909
Not a poop your pants face.

249
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,848
You can get me man, and
then I'll show you, my man.

250
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:58,737
- [Jeremy] Oh (laughs).

251
00:08:58,737 --> 00:08:59,570
And there's not just one of them.

252
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:00,547
There's more than one,

253
00:09:00,547 --> 00:00:00,000
is this a thing and I had no idea?
