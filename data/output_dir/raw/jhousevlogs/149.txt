1
00:00:00,515 --> 00:00:02,765
(laughing)

2
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:08,104
- She got the biggest one.

3
00:00:09,124 --> 00:00:11,079
- [Elise] Good job Isaac.

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,538
- J House store, right here.

5
00:00:13,538 --> 00:00:15,090
- Come to the J House store,

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:17,840
it's the best store in the world.

7
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:22,430
- So with our AC still not working,

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,898
we slept with all the windows open,

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,026
but it's still 80 degrees in our house

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,670
and the guy is coming this morning

11
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:29,777
to try to fix it.

12
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:32,277
(happy music)

13
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,275
Janae's staying here,

14
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:40,189
but the rest of us are
going to Isaac's first.

15
00:00:40,189 --> 00:00:41,447
- Soccer game.

16
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:44,030
(upbeat music)

17
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:02,545
- Good job Isaac.

18
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:05,051
- [Jeremy] Good pass.

19
00:01:05,052 --> 00:01:07,567
- [Elise] Good job, good job Isaac.

20
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,317
- Laura, can you see?

21
00:01:12,353 --> 00:01:15,973
So the sun is out, but
it's raining right now

22
00:01:15,973 --> 00:01:17,912
so they're playing in the rain.

23
00:01:17,912 --> 00:01:19,471
- [Woman] Come on sir, get up there.

24
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:20,907
Spread out.

25
00:01:20,907 --> 00:01:21,965
- [Jeremy] Do you need to go potty?

26
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:22,798
- Yep.

27
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:24,341
To the port-a-potty.

28
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,370
- [Jeremy] Port-a-potty time.

29
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,188
We went right before
we left though, right?

30
00:01:27,188 --> 00:01:28,244
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:29,513
- But I need to go right now.

32
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,346
- [Jeremy] That's right.

33
00:01:30,346 --> 00:01:31,179
I'm glad you told me.

34
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:32,374
Thank you.

35
00:01:32,374 --> 00:01:33,330
- You're welcome.

36
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,771
♫ If you need to go potty

37
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,942
♫ Stop right over there

38
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:41,066
(playfully pensive music)

39
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,324
- [Jeremy] There it is.

40
00:01:42,324 --> 00:01:43,907
- Wow, it's so big.

41
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:45,778
- [Jeremy] Did you have fun?

42
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:47,187
- Yeah.
- Did you get some Gatorade?

43
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:48,020
- Yeah.

44
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,080
- [Kendra] So Ms. Elise has
moved on to subtraction today.

45
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,963
How's it going?

46
00:01:50,963 --> 00:01:52,894
♫ It is awesome

47
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:54,532
- [Jeremy] Laura are you feeding Janae?

48
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,235
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

49
00:01:56,235 --> 00:01:57,967
She got the bowl.

50
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,217
(laughing)

51
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:04,915
Loaded nachos for lunch.

52
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:05,748
- [Kendra] Elisy, what are you doing?

53
00:02:05,748 --> 00:02:07,249
- Our J House store.

54
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,814
- [Kendra] So you have a J House store?

55
00:02:08,814 --> 00:02:11,269
- It has everything and a refrigerator.

56
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:13,936
(playful music)

57
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:17,797
- [Kendra] Nice, the J House store.

58
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:19,770
Who's working at the J House store today?

59
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,731
- Me and Caleb and Laura.

60
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:23,503
We're people that will help you today.

61
00:02:23,503 --> 00:02:25,311
- [Kendra] So am I just
supposed to buy stuff?

62
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,144
- [Elise] Yeah.

63
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:27,698
- [Kendra] Okay, so can I
choose some of these books?

64
00:02:27,698 --> 00:02:29,813
- Yes.
- Any recommendations?

65
00:02:29,813 --> 00:02:32,751
- This book is the goodest book to read.

66
00:02:32,751 --> 00:02:34,531
- [Kendra] Ma'am, here's what I've got.

67
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,939
I picked out a book.

68
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,106
And I picked out a baby toy
and I picked out some wipes.

69
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,091
Did I buy it?

70
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:48,901
- [Laura] Um hmm.

71
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,004
There you go.

72
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,481
- [Kendra] That's quite the receipt.

73
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:53,314
- Beep.

74
00:02:54,809 --> 00:02:57,438
- [Kendra] Well thank you ma'am.

75
00:02:57,438 --> 00:02:59,540
- You're welcome.

76
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,424
- [Kendra] Thanks.

77
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:01,794
- And here's your receipt.

78
00:03:01,794 --> 00:03:03,687
- [Kendra] Awesome.

79
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:04,978
Have a good day.

80
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:05,861
- Okay.

81
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,971
(thunder crashing)

82
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:11,572
- Well Jeremy was just getting ready

83
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:13,224
to go out and mow our lawn.

84
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:14,870
And I don't know if you can hear or see,

85
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,436
but it's definitely raining.

86
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:17,524
Like pouring.

87
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:20,020
There is no way we are going
to be able to mow today.

88
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,799
So I guess our lawn will just get longer

89
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:23,409
and we'll move again soon.

90
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:26,831
- The forecast said it
wasn't gonna rain until 8:00.

91
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,414
I was supposed to mow the lawn.

92
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:32,380
- Is it done?

93
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,317
- That was a lot of
rain in that short time.

94
00:03:34,317 --> 00:03:36,078
- It was.
- The sprinklers

95
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:37,230
are still going over there.

96
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,835
- [Kendra] The neighbor's
sprinklers are still going.

97
00:03:38,835 --> 00:03:41,151
- J House store right here.

98
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:42,800
- Come to the J House store,

99
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,891
it's the best store in the world.

100
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,713
- [Jeremy] What can I
get at the J House store?

101
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:48,761
- You can get whatever you want.

102
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,331
There's couches, there's a refrigerator.

103
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:51,716
- [Jeremy] Anything?

104
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:53,855
- Yeah, we have a swingset.

105
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:56,651
First I need your dedification.

106
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,666
What's your name?

107
00:03:57,666 --> 00:03:58,506
- [Jeremy] Are you talking to me?

108
00:03:58,506 --> 00:03:59,339
- Yes.

109
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,210
- (laughs) My name's Jeremy.

110
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,879
Do you guys have
Worcestershire sauce here?

111
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,798
- Um, I think so.

112
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,282
- [Jeremy] Okay, I was
really hoping to get

113
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:09,114
some Worcestershire sauce.

114
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:10,951
Can you say that?

115
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,539
- Wurshershire shauce.

116
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:14,075
- We are out of it.

117
00:04:14,075 --> 00:04:15,033
- [Jeremy] Oh you're out of it?

118
00:04:15,033 --> 00:04:16,120
- [Elise] I know where it is.

119
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,021
It's in the back.

120
00:04:17,022 --> 00:04:18,404
- [Jeremy] So how much
is this gonna cost me.

121
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:19,237
- $80,000.

122
00:04:20,185 --> 00:04:22,125
- [Jeremy] Is that my receipt?

123
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,382
- Not yet.

124
00:04:23,382 --> 00:04:25,918
- [Jeremy] There's more?

125
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:26,751
Alright.

126
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,915
- That's how much a million
thousand dollars is.

127
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:33,718
- And some people just come
here to get more money.

128
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,820
- [Jeremy] Whoa, could I
get more money instead?

129
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,276
How 'bout instead of me
getting Worcestershire sauce,

130
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:40,894
what if I just buy a million dollars?

131
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:41,830
From you guys.

132
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,692
- Okay, go get that.

133
00:04:42,692 --> 00:04:43,706
- How much would that cost?

134
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,774
- That would cost.

135
00:04:45,774 --> 00:04:47,069
- Two million dollars.
- No.

136
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:47,902
$2.

137
00:04:47,902 --> 00:04:48,738
- [Jeremy] $2?

138
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:50,240
Okay, let me grab my money.

139
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,477
- You can hand that back.

140
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:52,582
- [Jeremy] Okay, here ya go.

141
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:54,082
And here's the $2.

142
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:56,838
No I'm just kidding.

143
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,784
I'm not really gonna give you money.

144
00:04:58,784 --> 00:05:00,447
She was so excited.

145
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,517
- The mountain of soap is this.

146
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:03,911
- [Kendra] Is it a mountain of soap?

147
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,997
- Yeah.
- Oh my goodness.

148
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:08,321
You guys ready to get in to
Mom and Dad's big bathtub?

149
00:05:08,321 --> 00:05:10,250
- Hey, wanna see a magic trick?

150
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,083
- [Kendra] Yeah.

151
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,341
- Without dying?

152
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:13,174
- [Kendra] Oh without dying?

153
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:16,544
Yes, I wanna see one without dying.

154
00:05:16,544 --> 00:05:18,357
- [Laura] I do want soap.

155
00:05:18,357 --> 00:05:21,439
- [Kendra] Whoa, you can go under water.

156
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,652
Whoa.

157
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:24,130
That was so long.

158
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,121
- [Jeremy] Introducing
Elise from Kansas City!

159
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,704
(crowd cheers)

160
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:32,699
- [Kendra] You decided to join the fun?

161
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,004
- [Elise] Yep.

162
00:05:34,004 --> 00:05:35,235
- [Jeremy] She's like what is this?

163
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,962
- I think Janae wants to come.

164
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,159
But Mommy's gonna hold her.

165
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,162
- [Jeremy] Alright, let's
all see your best beards.

166
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:44,588
(playful music)
(kids laughing)

167
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:45,755
Oh I like 'em.

168
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:50,847
- [Kendra] Caleb has a pony tail.

169
00:05:50,847 --> 00:05:52,439
(laughing)

170
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,826
Did you create a slide?

171
00:05:53,826 --> 00:05:54,804
- Yeah.
- Let's see it.

172
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,578
Do your slide.

173
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:57,565
Whoo!

174
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,637
Alright, these have not
been working all the time.

175
00:05:59,637 --> 00:06:01,720
So we're hoping it works.

176
00:06:03,225 --> 00:06:04,058
Nothing.

177
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,449
(laughs)

178
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:11,899
- [Elise] We might need Dad.

179
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:13,515
- [Kendra] What would Dad do?

180
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:15,099
- [Elise] He's stronger than you.

181
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:17,246
- [Kendra] Oh, so then
he could push the button?

182
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:19,386
- Yeah.
- But he will break it.

183
00:06:19,386 --> 00:06:20,889
- [Kendra] See?

184
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,373
Give it a try buddy boy.

185
00:06:22,373 --> 00:06:23,540
- Got it down.

186
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:27,973
- [Kendra] Your pony tail is funny.

187
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:29,254
- Okay, let me.

188
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:32,933
- [Kendra] Push it down, give it a try.

189
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:33,766
- Got it?

190
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:34,599
- I will go down in history

191
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:36,866
as the man who pushed a button.

192
00:06:36,866 --> 00:06:38,256
You guys ready for this?

193
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:39,647
- [Laura] No, it doesn't work.

194
00:06:39,647 --> 00:06:40,517
- [Jeremy] Okay.

195
00:06:40,517 --> 00:06:41,353
(jacuzzi rumbles)

196
00:06:41,353 --> 00:06:42,392
(kids cheer)

197
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:43,645
Hey guys!

198
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,062
Dad got it, yeah!

199
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:49,174
The bubbles are gonna start bubbling.

200
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,924
(kids squealing)

201
00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:58,258
- I knew you could do
it, I knew you could.

202
00:06:58,258 --> 00:06:59,783
- So how did you get it to work?

203
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:00,953
- [Jeremy] I pushed the button.

204
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:01,786
- No like really?

205
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:02,729
How did you get it to work?

206
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:04,541
'Cause I pushed that
thing and I pushed it.

207
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,567
Did I like prime it for you or something?

208
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:07,841
- [Jeremy] Yep, you got it ready for me.

209
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:09,687
- [Kendra] There we go.

210
00:07:09,687 --> 00:07:13,078
(Caleb laughs)

211
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:16,832
- This is my first time
putting a baby in her pajamas.

212
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:17,850
- [Kendra] You did it?

213
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:18,683
- Uh huh.

214
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:19,744
- Alright, so I'm just
cleaning up the kitchen

215
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:20,985
and look what I found.

216
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:23,061
All of these cups.

217
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:24,597
Those are Jeremy and I's cups.

218
00:07:24,597 --> 00:07:26,067
And this is for my children.

219
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:28,739
It looks I have like
eight kids, which I don't.

220
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,951
I only have four kids
that drink out of cups.

221
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,610
I have tried everything to
pound it into my kids' head

222
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,457
that they use their one cup each day.

223
00:07:35,457 --> 00:07:36,555
But it never works.

224
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,013
If you have any great ideas

225
00:07:38,013 --> 00:07:41,266
for how to teach kids just
use their one cup a day,

226
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:43,078
or I don't know what to do.

227
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,275
So if you have any ideas,
let me know in the comments.

228
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,723
I bought this for a
dollar at a garage sale

229
00:07:47,723 --> 00:07:48,643
a couple years ago.

230
00:07:48,643 --> 00:07:50,350
It says ages eight and up.

231
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,387
But I think you just
have to be able to read.

232
00:07:52,387 --> 00:07:54,006
And I think enough of our kids read now

233
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:55,201
that we we can play this game.

234
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,034
We're gonna try.

235
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:56,867
- So during each round someone's it

236
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:59,004
and everybody else has to
look at their four cards

237
00:07:59,004 --> 00:08:01,161
and decide which one they
think I will like the most.

238
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:04,615
Then I rank them and whoever gets the card

239
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:07,528
I like the most wins that round.

240
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,552
- You have to choose this one or this one.

241
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:13,209
- [Jeremy] If it's nacho cheese,

242
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:15,452
you know that's the one to go for.

243
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:16,912
Got it?

244
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,651
- [Kendra] So do you
like any of the things?

245
00:08:18,651 --> 00:08:19,745
- I like some of them.

246
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:20,578
- [Kendra] Nice.

247
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:24,086
- Your choices are
wrestling, Super Bowl Sunday,

248
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,169
hip hop and room service.

249
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:28,301
That's amazing.

250
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:31,207
Well room service is my
favorite one of these.

251
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:32,724
- [Caleb] I did room service!

252
00:08:32,724 --> 00:08:33,557
- [Kendra] Did you?

253
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,150
Caleb, what is room service?

254
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:38,719
- I think it's helping
somebody with their room.

255
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:39,581
- [Kendra] Nice.

256
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:40,509
- Like service.

257
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,095
We'll just let them believe

258
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:43,706
that that's what I love the most

259
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:46,005
is serving other people in their bedrooms.

260
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:48,529
So room service is when you're at a hotel

261
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:53,049
and you order dinner or ice
cream and chocolate cake,

262
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,907
or other yumminesses and they
just bring it to your room

263
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:56,970
and you eat it right there.

264
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,720
(dramatic music)

265
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,149
Ice cream time!

266
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,195
So the funniest part of that game

267
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:05,661
was that Laura dominated.

268
00:09:05,661 --> 00:09:08,999
Like I think she picked
the right one three times.

269
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,609
(kids laughing)

270
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:13,308
- She got the biggest one.

271
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:14,141
- That's okay.

272
00:09:14,141 --> 00:09:15,558
I like green too.

273
00:09:17,742 --> 00:09:19,836
- You might just have a ton of weapon.

274
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,115
- [Kendra] And a cookie and a cookie.

275
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:23,038
So it's family date night tonight,

276
00:09:23,038 --> 00:09:24,965
which is also known as we
couldn't get a babysitter,

277
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,113
so we'll stay in and play with them.

278
00:09:27,113 --> 00:09:29,465
- He was now eating
dead rats by the crate.

279
00:09:29,465 --> 00:09:30,583
Who I've never met.

280
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:31,596
But the way Henry goes--

281
00:09:31,596 --> 00:09:33,242
- Goodnight, J House out.

282
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:37,867
- Janae had a big poo and it's
very disgusting and yucky.

283
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:38,961
- Did you guys see that?

284
00:09:38,961 --> 00:09:40,885
- [Jeremy] So it's getting
hotter and hotter in our house

285
00:09:40,885 --> 00:09:44,126
and I just called about getting it fixed.

286
00:09:44,126 --> 00:00:00,000
And they closed 15 minutes ago.
