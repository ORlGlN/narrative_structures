1
00:00:00,549 --> 00:00:01,507
- So guys, guess what.

2
00:00:01,507 --> 00:00:03,046
- What?

3
00:00:03,046 --> 00:00:04,395
- We have a surprise for you.

4
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,395
(gasps)

5
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:10,346
- [Child] Is it a big surprise?

6
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:12,020
- I think it's a pretty big surprise.

7
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,686
- Wait, do you know it?
- I do know it.

8
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:16,117
First we're gonna look at some pictures

9
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,134
together as a family, okay?

10
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:19,406
Do you guys know who this person is?

11
00:00:19,406 --> 00:00:21,573
- Isaac.
- It's baby Isaac.

12
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,808
- [Baby] That's baby Isaac.

13
00:00:24,808 --> 00:00:25,641
- [Kendra] Who's this one?

14
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:28,075
- Elise.
- Baby Elise.

15
00:00:28,075 --> 00:00:30,854
- She was a cutie magootie.

16
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:32,907
- Look, this is baby Caleb, guys.

17
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:34,479
Alright, who's this one?

18
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,917
- Laura!
- Yeah, Laura!

19
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:37,750
- Yeah.

20
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,406
So guys, guess what.

21
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,194
We have had four beautiful
babies in our family

22
00:00:45,194 --> 00:00:47,305
and we are going to have another baby.

23
00:00:47,305 --> 00:00:49,204
- Another one!
(gasps)

24
00:00:49,204 --> 00:00:50,837
- We are having a new baby.

25
00:00:50,837 --> 00:00:52,837
(gasps)

26
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:57,687
- It doesn't look like you're
gonna have another baby.

27
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:59,639
- I know, it's 'cause
the baby's really little,

28
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:01,739
it has to grow, but
there's a baby in my tummy.

29
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,247
- Oh, are you pregnant?
- I am, I'm pregnant.

30
00:01:04,247 --> 00:01:08,220
- Laura, you're gonna have a little baby.

31
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,279
(gasps)

32
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:13,029
- I hope it's a sister,
I hope it's a sister.

33
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:18,110
- That is not a surprise.
- Oh, it's not a surprise?

34
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:20,378
- Your tummy's a little bigger.

35
00:01:20,378 --> 00:01:21,410
- Thanks.

36
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,225
- I wanna feel the baby laugh.

37
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:24,972
- You can't feel the baby yet.

38
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:26,538
Do you know how little the baby is?

39
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:29,795
- Like probably that big?
- This big!

40
00:01:29,795 --> 00:01:32,398
- I can show you guys how big
it is, do you guys wanna see?

41
00:01:32,398 --> 00:01:33,231
- Yeah!

42
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,175
- Do you guys see this
little tiny poppy seed?

43
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:36,134
- Yeah.

44
00:01:36,134 --> 00:01:38,010
- That's how big our baby is right now.

45
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,586
- What?
- Can I get it?

46
00:01:40,586 --> 00:01:41,695
- Yeah.

47
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:44,266
- If it's a she, I'll call it a she.

48
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:47,680
- Good plan.
- But how is it so small?

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,374
- Because it starts so small
and then it gets bigger

50
00:01:50,374 --> 00:01:53,099
and bigger and then we
will go to the hospital

51
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:55,627
and get the baby, and
we'll bring the baby home.

52
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:57,543
- Where's the baby go?

53
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:59,089
- I think she thinks the
poppy seed is a baby.

54
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:01,110
- Did we lose the poppy seed?

55
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,357
(laughs)

56
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,307
- Laura, the baby's inside my tummy.

57
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:06,087
- There's a baby in mine.

58
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,397
- There's a baby in your tummy?

59
00:02:07,397 --> 00:02:09,419
- Oh.
- You wanna feel it?

60
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,082
- Oh sure, you have a
little baby in there?

61
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:12,428
(laughs)

62
00:02:12,428 --> 00:02:13,555
- No, can you feel it in here?

63
00:02:13,555 --> 00:02:14,730
- I feel it right here.

64
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,813
(laughs)

65
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:20,081
- Tummy.
- Is that your tummy?

66
00:02:20,081 --> 00:02:22,455
- Does anyone else know yet?

67
00:02:22,455 --> 00:02:25,195
- No, do you guys wanna tell people?

68
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,478
- Yeah!
- For sure!

69
00:02:27,478 --> 00:02:30,955
- For sure, do you guys
wanna call and tell somebody?

70
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:34,942
- Yeah I wanna tell
everyone in our family.

71
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:37,442
(phone rings)

72
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:39,216
- Shh.

73
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:47,647
- [Jody] It's Jody!
- We're having a new baby.

74
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:53,875
- [Jody] What?
- Tell her, tell her!

75
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:56,042
- We're having a new baby!

76
00:02:57,243 --> 00:02:58,421
- [Jody] You got a new bed?

77
00:02:58,421 --> 00:02:59,643
(laughs)

78
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:01,844
- Not a new bed, Caleb you tell her.

79
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:02,927
- A new baby.

80
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:04,929
(gasps)

81
00:03:04,929 --> 00:03:07,096
- We're having a new baby!

82
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:11,466
- We're having a new baby!

83
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,988
- [Jody] No way!
- Yes we are.

84
00:03:16,168 --> 00:03:18,335
- Yes we are.
- Yes we are.

85
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:21,811
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

86
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:24,230
- [Jeremy] We're pregnant,
we're gonna have a baby.

87
00:03:24,230 --> 00:00:00,000
- It's a big deal, guys, it's a baby.
