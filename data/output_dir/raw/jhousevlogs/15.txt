1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,391
(laughing)

2
00:00:02,391 --> 00:00:04,974
(bright music)

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,633
- Tyrannosaurus Rex's real tooth.

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,939
- [Jeremy] Laura, are
you gonna do some art?

5
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:23,097
- [Laura] Uh-huh!

6
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:25,847
(cheerful music)

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,600
- So we dropped Laura
off at an art preschool.

8
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,060
She was really excited about it.

9
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,228
And I'm taking the older kids
to the Museum of Prairiefire.

10
00:00:43,228 --> 00:00:44,770
Kendra and I have wanted
to take the kids here

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,603
for a long time.

12
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:47,414
- That's dinosaur bones.

13
00:00:47,414 --> 00:00:48,606
- [Child] Is that real?

14
00:00:48,606 --> 00:00:50,643
- [Jeremy] (excited laughter)

15
00:00:50,643 --> 00:00:51,893
Thank you, sir.

16
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,423
There it is.

17
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,730
That's so cool.

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,047
So this screen shows us, and then it has

19
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,210
dinosaurs come through.

20
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,319
(chuckling)

21
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:16,408
(dinosaur roars)

22
00:01:16,408 --> 00:01:18,491
Uh, you just got toasted.

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,863
- I got eaten by a T-Rex.

24
00:01:22,863 --> 00:01:24,990
- [Jeremy] I hate when that happens.

25
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,890
- So Laura's at a preschool art program.

26
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,480
Jeremy has the big kids at a field trip,

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,730
and so I'm just home with Janae.

28
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:31,470
We've been enjoying our time together,

29
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,801
I've been getting a lot
done, but also trying

30
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:35,067
to force myself to not get very much done,

31
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,140
and just enjoy my time with Janae.

32
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,676
She's growing up so
fast, like I just want to

33
00:01:38,676 --> 00:01:40,770
sit on the floor and play
with her, and read with her.

34
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,411
And it's been funny though,
because she's so confused.

35
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,571
She keeps, like, walking
up and down the hallways,

36
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,240
and looking into the room.

37
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,181
She's like, "Dada?"

38
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:50,523
She stands at the top of the
stairs and she screeches,

39
00:01:50,523 --> 00:01:53,087
she's like (screeching),
is anybody down there?

40
00:01:53,087 --> 00:01:54,710
So it's just kind of
funny, 'cause she's not

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,693
used to not having the big kids around.

42
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,116
- Hey, Dad, is this real bones?

43
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:05,993
- [Jeremy] I don't know,
let's read about it.

44
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,625
It's really the bones?

45
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,880
- [Isaac] It's from
Big Dry Creek, Montana.

46
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,713
- [Jeremy] Wow.

47
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:15,324
- This is nearly the first
T-Rex bones put together.

48
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,723
- [Jeremy] Right here.

49
00:02:23,066 --> 00:02:25,483
(rock music)

50
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,333
You discovered a fossil in Wyoming, Elise.

51
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,659
Ooh, it lets you pick
how you want it to look?

52
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,039
Elise did the head of hers.

53
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:41,901
Lisey?

54
00:02:41,901 --> 00:02:43,319
What are you gonna name yours?

55
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,152
- Flapper.

56
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:45,014
- [Jeremy] Flapper?

57
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:45,869
- Or Flopster.

58
00:02:45,869 --> 00:02:46,867
- [Jeremy] Flopster?

59
00:02:46,867 --> 00:02:48,077
Caleb, Jr.?

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,130
Well, the dinosaurs that
we made are showing up

61
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,764
in the great hall to play with us.

62
00:02:53,764 --> 00:02:54,737
- That's mine.

63
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:56,928
- [Jeremy] There's yours, Flopster!

64
00:02:56,928 --> 00:02:59,168
- [Isaac] Flopster, come here!

65
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:02,750
- [Jeremy] Lisey, you've made it!

66
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,960
(chuckles)

67
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,963
Here comes Nice, this one's mine.

68
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,393
Caleb, Jr.

69
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:14,887
- It bit him.

70
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,511
- [Jeremy] Did he eat you?

71
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:18,960
- Yeah.

72
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,883
- All in to the Discovery Room.

73
00:03:22,646 --> 00:03:24,122
- You see all those circles?

74
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:24,955
- [Kids] Mm-hmm.

75
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,130
- That's where earthquakes happen.

76
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,019
Do you see the red ones
up here, like that one?

77
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,502
If we touch it, that happened this morning

78
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:33,490
up in the Gulf of Alaska.

79
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,484
See that one there
happened on March the 6th

80
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:37,047
over in Puerto Rico.

81
00:03:37,047 --> 00:03:37,880
- Oh, wow.

82
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,861
- [Jeremy] So you can look
up all of the earthquakes.

83
00:03:39,861 --> 00:03:41,686
- Yup, so if you look
at all these purples,

84
00:03:41,686 --> 00:03:44,640
you can see that's called,
this here is called

85
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,763
the ring of fire, because that's where

86
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,563
a lot of earthquakes happen.

87
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:52,710
- [Child] Whoa.

88
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,782
- [Guide] You see this type of rock?

89
00:03:53,782 --> 00:03:55,380
It's a mineral, okay?

90
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,460
You can't see through that.

91
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,180
But look, if I put it down that way,

92
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,713
you can see right through it!

93
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,893
- [Jeremy] Transparent rocks.

94
00:04:01,893 --> 00:04:02,753
- Whoa, this one.

95
00:04:02,753 --> 00:04:04,917
- [Isaac] We're allowed
to touch everything.

96
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,503
- [Guide] Oh, that is a
really big one, right?

97
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,757
And that's how geologists and things

98
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:14,693
can identify what it's made out of.

99
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,577
Look at this rock here, real close.

100
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,149
Look at it real, real close.

101
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,359
What do you think it's made out of?

102
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,457
- [Caleb] Sparkles?

103
00:04:22,457 --> 00:04:24,560
- [Guide] Hmm, have you ever had a penny?

104
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,393
- [Caleb] Yeah.

105
00:04:25,393 --> 00:04:26,727
- [Guide] That's what
penny gets made out of.

106
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:28,193
That's a copper ore.
- [Jeremy] It's copper.

107
00:04:28,193 --> 00:04:29,026
- [Isaac] Feel this.

108
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:29,859
- [Jeremy] What is it?

109
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:31,000
- [Isaac] It's a rock.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,363
- [Guide] Smell that one, it stinks.

111
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,966
- [Jeremy] Is that a stinky rock?

112
00:04:33,966 --> 00:04:35,433
- [Guide] That has a lot of sulfate in it,

113
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,133
so that's why it's smelly.

114
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,350
- It's fun that they have it set up here

115
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,240
where the kids are supposed
to open every drawer

116
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,700
and play with everything
inside, I love that.

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,520
- [Kendra] We brought
the laundry hamper over.

118
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,270
Now things are getting interesting.

119
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,693
Good one!

120
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,394
Oh yeah!

121
00:04:52,394 --> 00:04:54,770
(laughing)

122
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,633
It's lunch time.

123
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,330
How's your strawberry?

124
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,163
Pretty good?

125
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:01,450
- Mm-hmm.

126
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,283
- Mm-hmm.

127
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,173
More? More?

128
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:09,229
I'm feeding Janae these
tiny bites of ice cream

129
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:11,042
after she's finished her squash

130
00:05:11,042 --> 00:05:14,421
and black beans and strawberries.

131
00:05:14,421 --> 00:05:16,015
Mmm.

132
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,069
Say more.

133
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:18,903
(gasps) Good job!

134
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,443
- [Jeremy] Those are skins.

135
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:24,140
- [Elise] That's an African civet.

136
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:28,752
(pleasant music)

137
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,930
(Caleb laughs)

138
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,364
- [Jeremy] They seem really distractable.

139
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:37,334
Look like they're paying attention.

140
00:05:37,334 --> 00:05:39,321
- Found the woodpecker.

141
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,110
- [Jeremy] Oh, there's the.

142
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,418
You guys gotta try to find the animals,

143
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:44,623
you might need your binoculars.

144
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,253
Did you guys see the racoon?

145
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,626
All right, so they're
all looking for the bee,

146
00:05:56,626 --> 00:05:57,886
don't give them any hints.

147
00:05:57,886 --> 00:05:58,795
(Guide laughs)

148
00:05:58,795 --> 00:05:59,628
- Found it.
- [Caleb] I found it!

149
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:00,461
- [Jeremy] You guys found it?

150
00:06:00,461 --> 00:06:01,759
- [Child] It's inside of that hole.

151
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,209
- [Jeremy] Oh, that's tricky.

152
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,158
- This is a Tyrannosaurus
Rex's real tooth.

153
00:06:14,158 --> 00:06:15,571
- [Jeremy] T-Rex tooth?

154
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:16,710
- [Elise] Can I hold it?

155
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,078
- [Isaac] It doesn't feel that sharp.

156
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,693
- [Elise] It's supposed to be white.

157
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:21,970
- [Jeremy] Imagine, though,
if it was crushing down

158
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,993
at you with 1,000 pounds of a bite.

159
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,577
So is this a puzzle?

160
00:06:26,577 --> 00:06:27,910
- [Child] Right.

161
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,410
- [Jeremy] Bathroom break.

162
00:06:45,057 --> 00:06:47,590
When you look left and
right, it'll be like

163
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,600
you're looking left and right.

164
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,760
Elise, you ready to try virtual reality?

165
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,900
No response. (softly chuckles)

166
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,135
So remember, you are
just sitting on a chair

167
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,233
in a room, and so at any
time, you can take it off.

168
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,300
Thumbs up if you hear something.

169
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,993
It's just like a ride, kind of.

170
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,434
Isaac, what do you think of that?

171
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:09,267
- [Isaac] Whoa.

172
00:07:09,267 --> 00:07:10,200
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

173
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,717
Spin slowly.

174
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:13,304
- I liked it.

175
00:07:13,304 --> 00:07:15,596
- [Jeremy] You got to
see a volcano blow up.

176
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:16,570
- [Elise] I loved it.

177
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,120
It was awesome.

178
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,950
- [Jeremy] We were the
first people to watch it.

179
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,283
- It felt like I was upside down.

180
00:07:29,605 --> 00:07:30,623
- [Guide] You'll see, if you
stand back and look at it,

181
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:32,910
you'll see the outline of a lion.

182
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,206
A shooting star is really a nickname

183
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:38,740
for something that is called a meteorite.

184
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,929
So you're gonna get to hold something

185
00:07:39,929 --> 00:07:41,830
that came from outer space.

186
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,130
- So the kids are getting
to hold a meteorite.

187
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,370
This is Apollo 13.

188
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,754
So they flew up to go to the moon,

189
00:07:53,754 --> 00:07:56,740
and then their rocket
kind of had an explosion,

190
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,430
and oxygen was leaking.

191
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,081
And they had to try
and get them back home.

192
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,175
- [Caleb] Did they get here?

193
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:02,601
- [Jeremy] Yep, they survived.

194
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,633
They made it back.

195
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,335
So we ordered our pizza,
but we wanted to check out

196
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:13,363
this toy store right next door.

197
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,120
(energetic music)

198
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,880
Look at this robotic arm, you guys.

199
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,390
Code Gamer, you can actually build games.

200
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,313
So this toy store is focused
on, like, educational stuff.

201
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:36,971
That's just K'Nex, right?

202
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:39,639
- [Caleb] How'd they make it just like go?

203
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,614
Oh they have a wire.

204
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,447
- [Jeremy] Plugged in.

205
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:52,860
- Pesto?

206
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,006
- [Jeremy] Yep. We just
gotta make sure to save some

207
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:56,730
for Mom, okay, you guys?

208
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,876
And we have another pizza coming.

209
00:08:57,876 --> 00:08:58,709
- 'Kay.

210
00:08:58,709 --> 00:08:59,542
- Hot.

211
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:00,920
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it just
came out of an oven.

212
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,013
It's gonna be hard to bite
pizza without any teeth.

213
00:09:03,013 --> 00:09:04,160
- Yeah.

214
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,168
- [Jeremy] So Kendra was
saying that Grimaldi's

215
00:09:05,168 --> 00:09:09,040
is like a famous pizza place,
Brooklyn style type pizza.

216
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,180
It's really, really good.

217
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,477
You can tell that they use
the real mozzarella cheese.

218
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:13,640
It's yummy.

219
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,473
What do you guys think?

220
00:09:14,473 --> 00:09:15,306
- It's good.

221
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,970
- [Jeremy] You're trying so hard to eat!

222
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,040
- [Isaac] It's amazing.

223
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:18,927
- [Jeremy] You gotta like--

224
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:19,760
- [Elise] I just eat from my sides.

225
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,260
- [Jeremy] Eat it on the side?

226
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:24,246
Good job.

227
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,451
I just like walked
away, and left the pizza

228
00:09:29,451 --> 00:09:32,015
sitting on top of, in a
box that was ready to go,

229
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:33,540
like, it was all set.

230
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,511
And I just forgot.

231
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,050
So I'm mourning the loss of the pizza.

232
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,272
Kendra, like, really wanted to try it,

233
00:09:38,272 --> 00:09:39,656
so we'll have to back there sometime

234
00:09:39,656 --> 00:09:41,800
and have some more yummy pizza.

235
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,310
So Laura, how was your time
this morning doing art?

236
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,400
- [Laura] Good.

237
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,455
- [Jeremy] You cleaning up the noodles?

238
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:49,576
- Can you hold this for
me while I sweep it up?

239
00:09:49,576 --> 00:09:50,909
- [Jeremy] Sure.

240
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,848
So what did you make today?

241
00:09:56,848 --> 00:09:57,798
- I did paint.

242
00:09:57,798 --> 00:09:58,631
- [Jeremy] You painted?

243
00:09:58,631 --> 00:09:59,470
Can I see it?

244
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,745
- And I got this.

245
00:10:00,745 --> 00:10:01,578
- [Jeremy] Ooh.

246
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:02,681
- I made it.

247
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:06,413
Purple, pink, blue, blue.

248
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,103
- [Jeremy] Hey!

249
00:10:08,103 --> 00:10:09,833
- Somebody took a good nap.

250
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:11,590
- We missed you this morning.

251
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,450
I have been super forgetful today.

252
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,256
I left the pizza at the restaurant,

253
00:10:16,256 --> 00:10:18,181
and then we were gonna do tacos tonight,

254
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:21,609
but I forgot to get out the
taco meat to defrost it.

255
00:10:21,609 --> 00:10:24,196
So as a result of my absent-mindedness,

256
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,727
we have picked up some
Panda Express for dinner.

257
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,400
- [Kendra] Which is a pretty good result.

258
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,522
The kids are all pretty happy with it.

259
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:30,560
- That's true.

260
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,330
Maybe I should lose my mind some more.

261
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,300
Who wants Panda Express?

262
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,133
- [Children] Me!

263
00:10:35,406 --> 00:10:36,239
Goodnight!

264
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:39,064
J House out.

265
00:10:39,064 --> 00:10:42,129
(laughter)

266
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:44,383
- Goodnight, J House out.

267
00:10:44,383 --> 00:10:45,700
- [Jeremy] Gonna make a cake?

268
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,550
- [Elise] Mm-hmm.

269
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,631
There's soap all over us!

270
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,804
- This is so yummy, I'm having so much fun

271
00:10:56,804 --> 00:00:00,000
tasting all the things!
