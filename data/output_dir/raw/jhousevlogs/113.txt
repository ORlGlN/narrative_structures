1
00:00:00,511 --> 00:00:03,094
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:07,275
- Today we're gonna do
the 100 layers challenge.

3
00:00:07,275 --> 00:00:10,298
- We're gonna be putting
100 shirts on Caleb.

4
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:12,881
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:18,155
- So we got 20 shirts from each

6
00:00:18,155 --> 00:00:20,453
person in our family,
except Jenae of course,

7
00:00:20,453 --> 00:00:22,249

8
00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:27,023
Okay take your shirt off
so we can get this going.

9
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:29,835
Alright our first shirt ready, go.

10
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:31,842
(peppy music)

11
00:00:31,842 --> 00:00:33,313
Caleb has to start with wearing Laura's

12
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:37,480
shirts 'cause that was the only
way we could get 100 shirts.

13
00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:41,664
(kids laughing)

14
00:00:41,664 --> 00:00:42,501
- Come on.

15
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,251
- [Jeremy] One shirt, two shirts.

16
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,181
(kids laughing)

17
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:53,563
(peppy music)

18
00:00:53,563 --> 00:00:55,053
Oop there's a button.

19
00:00:55,053 --> 00:00:55,886
- [Elise] You look so.

20
00:00:55,886 --> 00:00:58,553
(kids laughing)

21
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:01,770
- [Caleb] Oh my.

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,415
- [Jeremy] Okay we'll just
leave that one (mumbles).

23
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:05,543
- You look so beautiful.

24
00:01:05,543 --> 00:01:07,061
(peppy music)

25
00:01:07,061 --> 00:01:08,728
- I am the weirdest.

26
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:11,485
Oh wow.

27
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:14,165
- [Jeremy] It's almost like football pads.

28
00:01:14,165 --> 00:01:15,337
(kids laughing)

29
00:01:15,337 --> 00:01:16,999
Nope not to hard, okay.

30
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:19,499
(peppy music)

31
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:23,620
- Shoulder pads.

32
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,918
- This is the last one from Laura.

33
00:01:30,918 --> 00:01:31,859
- Finally.

34
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,442
(upbeat music)

35
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,516
- I think you're gaining
a lot more weight.

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:42,950
- Yeah I'm gonna weigh myself
once we're done with this.

37
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,533
(upbeat music)

38
00:01:48,927 --> 00:01:50,234
- [Elise] It looks so nice on you.

39
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,222
(kids laughing)

40
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,716
- Yeah I'm stronger than I used to.

41
00:01:54,716 --> 00:01:55,865
- Arm wrestle.

42
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:58,532
(kids laughing)

43
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,740
- [Jeremy] He's having
a hard time standing.

44
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,209
- [Isaac] Is it hard to stand?

45
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:09,634
- [Jeremy] With your funny arms.

46
00:02:09,634 --> 00:02:12,749
(kids laughing)

47
00:02:12,749 --> 00:02:15,166
(fast music)

48
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,299
So this is Caleb with all of Laura's

49
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:22,509
shirts and all of his
shirts on, how does it feel?

50
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:23,381
- Good.

51
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:25,875
- [Jeremy] Can you dance for us?

52
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,708
(Jeremy laughing)

53
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:34,204
Help him up, help him up.

54
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:37,916
- [Caleb] Thanks.

55
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,519
- [Jeremy] Pretty big shoulders and back.

56
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,140
And you've lost a neck.

57
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,202
Alright you ready to go
on to Elise's shirts?

58
00:02:44,202 --> 00:02:45,035
- [Caleb] Yeah.

59
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:46,814
- First my favorite.

60
00:02:46,814 --> 00:02:48,715
(soft music)

61
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:49,548
- So I think we're gonna stop

62
00:02:49,548 --> 00:02:52,219
doing Elise's shirts 'cause
it's gonna stretch them all out.

63
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,410
So here's Isaac's shirt.

64
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:55,827
(fast music)

65
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,556
- I'm a safety.

66
00:02:58,556 --> 00:03:01,225
- [Jeremy] Alright try to tackle Isaac.

67
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:04,058
(Jeremy laughing)

68
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:06,005
- [Caleb] Help here.

69
00:03:06,005 --> 00:03:07,838
- [Jeremy] He's stuck.

70
00:03:08,776 --> 00:03:11,187
(everyone laughing)

71
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:12,043
'Kay so now we're gonna start

72
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,396
putting on some of the bigger shirts.

73
00:03:13,396 --> 00:03:15,095
I don't think we're gonna
get all the way to 100.

74
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:17,602
There's just not enough Caleb.

75
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,185
(upbeat music)

76
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:22,613
Well I think we're gonna be done.

77
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:25,225
We didn't get to 100 but we put

78
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:27,118
a lot of shirts on Caleb.

79
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,336
So Caleb wanted to weigh himself.

80
00:03:28,336 --> 00:03:29,767
What do you normally weigh buddy?

81
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:31,285
- 40 pounds.

82
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,780
- [Jeremy] About 40 pounds,
'kay step on the scale.

83
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,363
Let's see what you weigh, 47.8.

84
00:03:39,149 --> 00:03:41,760
So that's about eight pounds of shirts.

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,593
- Wow.

86
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:43,426
- [Elise] Well he actually.

87
00:03:43,426 --> 00:03:46,009
(upbeat music)

88
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:06,944
(Caleb yells)

89
00:04:06,944 --> 00:04:08,455
(kids laughing)

90
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:09,955
- Well you did it.

91
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:12,793
So we're gonna have Isaac and Elise

92
00:04:12,793 --> 00:04:15,241
see how many shirts they
can put on in one minute.

93
00:04:15,241 --> 00:04:19,154
The world record is 31, you guys ready?

94
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:21,399
- [Caleb] Ready, set, go.

95
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,368
- [Jeremy] Alright how
many shirts, in a minute.

96
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:25,634
(upbeat music)

97
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:29,801
She's going fast, that's gonna
be hard with glasses too.

98
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,335
(Jeremy laughing)

99
00:04:32,335 --> 00:04:34,638
- [Isaac] Oh, oh oh, where is it.

100
00:04:34,638 --> 00:04:37,538
- [Jeremy] Isaac where are

101
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:40,121
(upbeat music)

102
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:48,874
Nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

103
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,709
(Jeremy laughing)

104
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,360
Oh I love it, 'kay let's count them.

105
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,406
How many did you guys get?

106
00:04:57,406 --> 00:04:59,906
(peppy music)

107
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:02,944
- (mumbles) and instant win, yeah.

108
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:05,096
- [Jeremy] Good job and you didn't quite

109
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,601
have that last one all the
way on but it was close.

110
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:07,434
- Yeah four and a half.

111
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:08,267
- Poll question how many shirts

112
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:09,868
can you put on in a minute I know

113
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:11,038
some of you might be in a public place

114
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:12,181
and so you can't try this out.

115
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,343
But if you're at home and you have

116
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,503
the chance time yourself
and let us know in the poll.

117
00:05:16,503 --> 00:05:17,621
We'd love to hear in the comments

118
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,813
any other challenges you
would like us to try.

119
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:21,703

123
00:05:28,677 --> 00:05:30,062
Separate them out.

125
00:05:31,627 --> 00:05:33,259
