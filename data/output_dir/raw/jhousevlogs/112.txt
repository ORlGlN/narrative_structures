1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,695
- [Mom] Well, we got my sister
Tiffany from the airport.

2
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:05,320
- And Laura's pants, check!
- What?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,487
Do you want to go swimming?
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:11,337 --> 00:00:12,337
Holy splash.

5
00:00:13,316 --> 00:00:16,312
So, our swim time ended
with a scary moment.

6
00:00:16,312 --> 00:00:18,896
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:24,532
(gentle piano music)

8
00:00:25,615 --> 00:00:28,865
- [Dad] Baby claps, those are my hands.

9
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:32,709
- Down the line as far as the river.

10
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:38,664
The river and over...
(gentle piano music)

11
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:42,018
- [Dad] It is cold out here.

12
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,618
(cheerful upbeat music)

13
00:00:56,177 --> 00:00:58,171
- [Caleb] So what are you doing, Dad?

14
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,758
- I'm making some Cream of Wheat.

15
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:02,911
- [Caleb] Yum, good thing it fills you.

16
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:06,244
(cheerful upbeat music)

17
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:21,001
- How is it?
- Good!

18
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,261
- I love Cream of Week.

19
00:01:24,261 --> 00:01:26,119
- You love Cream of Week?
- Yeah.

20
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,560
- [Dad] It's, uh, Cream of Wheat.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,866
- Cream, Cream of Wheat.
- There ya go.

22
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,554
- So something fun is happening today.

23
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:36,208
My sister is flying in to
visit us and I'm really excited

24
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,551
to get to see her and spend time with her.

25
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,106
The kids are thrilled to see their aunt.

26
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,259
I've been running around
like crazy this morning

27
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,931
trying to get the house all
clean, and it's not all clean.

28
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:44,943
So I'm kinda bummed, but,
I mean, she's my sister.

29
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:47,137
Houses don't have to be all the
way clean for sisters right?

30
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,415
- Right now we're going to the airport

31
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:52,873
to pick up Tiffany, my mom's sister.

32
00:01:52,873 --> 00:01:55,708
I'm really excited to see Aunt Tiffany.

33
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,757
Alright, well we got my sister
Tiffany from the airport

34
00:01:58,757 --> 00:02:01,059
and we're stopping at Target
on the way home to get some

35
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,149
fun things for a little activity
we're gonna do later today,

36
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:05,387
and maybe some food because I
haven't gone grocery shopping

37
00:02:05,387 --> 00:02:07,921
recently, but it's been
so fun, the kids are

38
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:10,380
chattering nonstop to
Tiffany, filling her in on

39
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,843
everything that's happened
since we last saw her.

40
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,273
So I'm picking up some veggies and fruit

41
00:02:13,273 --> 00:02:14,513
and some yummy stuff for lunch,

42
00:02:14,513 --> 00:02:16,153
we're gonna make some sandwiches at home.

43
00:02:16,153 --> 00:02:18,215
Yummy sandwiches, with
all the fixins on 'em.

44
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:19,921
- There we go, good work!

45
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:21,289
- Well we found all sorts of fun stuff.

46
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,212
We're gonna go home and eat well.

47
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:26,290
Tiffany even got us some
flowers, aren't those gorgeous?

48
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,966
It's gonna be a fun day.

49
00:02:27,966 --> 00:02:31,054
(cheerful upbeat music)

50
00:02:31,054 --> 00:02:34,040
- It's for Fuzzy, who's not there.

51
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,150
Time for dinner, help get ready!

52
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,742
Carry dishes, hold them steady.

53
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,618
- Aunts and uncles hold such
a special place in our lives.

54
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:43,223
In the comments, I
would love to hear about

55
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:46,080
an aunt or an uncle in your
life who just has really

56
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,915
made a difference, who
you look up to and admire

57
00:02:47,915 --> 00:02:49,582
and who you enjoy spending time with.

58
00:02:49,582 --> 00:02:50,749
Whatcha doin'?

59
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,010
- I'm trying to get my swimming suit.

60
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,906
- [Mom] Did it fall behind the washer?

61
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:58,489
- Yep.
- Well, can you reach it?

62
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:00,771
Oh, so close!

63
00:03:00,771 --> 00:03:03,292
Oh, I know what, I could get
you some like salad tweezers.

64
00:03:03,292 --> 00:03:04,242
- Yeah!

65
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:06,538
- We're headed to an indoor
pool today and I was trying to

66
00:03:06,538 --> 00:03:08,107
round up all of our swimsuits
because we haven't used them

67
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:12,154
in a while, and Isaac's we're
gonna try to get with this.

68
00:03:12,154 --> 00:03:15,399
Okay, you think that'll work?
- Yeah.

69
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,268
- What else is down there?

70
00:03:17,268 --> 00:03:21,831
- Eh, a pack of wipes,
one of Laura's dresses,

71
00:03:21,831 --> 00:03:25,914
a church shirt for Caleb,
and some soccer, like--

72
00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:29,244
- Cleats?
- No, not cleats.

73
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:31,010
- Shin guards?
- Yeah, shin guards.

74
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,986
- You got it!
- Better get some more.

75
00:03:32,986 --> 00:03:35,569
Yeah, and Laura's pants, check!

76
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:40,304
Salad tweezers are really
useful, they should be

77
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:43,262
like a real tool, like to get binkies.

78
00:03:43,262 --> 00:03:44,684
- [Mom] No, don't try to get your sister

79
00:03:44,684 --> 00:03:46,047
with the salad tweezers.

80
00:03:46,047 --> 00:03:48,834
- Or to pick up bouncers.

81
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:52,173
- So apparently, salad tweezers,
they're not just for salad.

82
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:53,574
Those things aren't called salad tweezers,

83
00:03:53,574 --> 00:03:54,921
what are they actually called?

84
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,033
Tongs, tongs, is that
what they are called?

85
00:03:57,033 --> 00:04:01,096
So I was holding Janae, and
I leaned over to tell Elise

86
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:05,412
something about her math problem,
and Janae just like bleh.

87
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,403
When your little sister is
helping you with your math work,

88
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:13,570
you might end up with
spit-up on your pages, sorry.

89
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,615
- That's so funny!
- I'm sorry.

90
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:25,171
- It was just like, "Elise
do this" and then (laughs).

91
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:27,143
- You thought it was funny?
- Yeah!

92
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,310
- Did it surprise you?
- Yeah!

93
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,761
- The perils of doing math
with your little sissy!

94
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:35,867
So I have the best surprise
for Laura right now.

95
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:39,600
Every single morning she wakes
up and she crawls into my bed

96
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,173
and the first thing she says to me is,

97
00:04:41,173 --> 00:04:43,359
"Mom, can we go swimming today?".

98
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:47,242
I'm gonna wake her up from her
nap and tell her we're going.

99
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,666
(gentle music)
Hey, Laura.

100
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,156
Do you want to go swimming?
- Sure.

101
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:56,573
- Sure, look what I'm wearing!
- Swimsuit.

102
00:04:58,002 --> 00:04:59,611
- [Mom] I am wearing my
swimsuit, do you want

103
00:04:59,611 --> 00:05:02,258
to get on your swimsuit?
- Sure.

104
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:03,897
- [Mom] Do you want to go to the pool?

105
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,432
- Sure.

106
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:06,970
- [Mom] Let's go get your swimsuit on.

107
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,435
- If the others are.
- The others are, let's go!

108
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,688
Well it's cold outside,
but we are going swimming.

109
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:15,064
So we're gonna be freezing
going into the pool

110
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,083
and freezing coming home,
but I think it's gonna be

111
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,491
really fun to swim while we're there.

112
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,492
Swimming is just awesome and we don't get

113
00:05:20,492 --> 00:05:22,414
to do it enough in the wintertime.

114
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:25,333
(cheerful upbeat music)
Haulin' all the stuff.

115
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,522
We were just walking in and I looked back,

116
00:05:27,522 --> 00:05:30,684
car door completely open,
we're losing our minds.

117
00:05:30,684 --> 00:05:32,604
- So I think every day for the last month

118
00:05:32,604 --> 00:05:35,415
Laura has asked us to go swimming,

119
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,690
and she normally has on a
swimsuit underneath her clothes

120
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,008
because she wants to go swimming.

121
00:05:39,008 --> 00:05:42,597
- [Mom] Well, here we are,
this is your big moment, yes!

122
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:44,724
There it is!
- But we got in the van

123
00:05:44,724 --> 00:05:47,181
and Laura said "I don't like swimming."

124
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,488
(Mom laughing)
That was what she said.

125
00:05:48,488 --> 00:05:50,561
- And that is a three-year-old for ya.

126
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,458
(laughter)

127
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:54,041
(upbeat music)

128
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,262
- [Dad] Laura, are you swimmin'?

129
00:06:40,262 --> 00:06:41,719
Look at you!

130
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:45,052
- Janae is mesmerized by all this water.

131
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,363
- [Dad] Are you gonna get in?

132
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:50,280
Whoa, yeah?

133
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,906
- Aah!
(splashing)

134
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:00,239
(cheerful upbeat music)

135
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:48,441
(fun playful music)

136
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:00,878
- [Mom] Holy splash.

137
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:03,570
- So the secret on the
slide is to arch your back

138
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,315
and go up on your toes so you
have very little surface area.

139
00:08:06,315 --> 00:08:07,716
- [Mom] That's how you get a big splash?

140
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:10,602
- That's how you go fast.
- Have you tried that?

141
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:12,795
- [Dad] Did you see how fast I was going?

142
00:08:12,795 --> 00:08:14,733
- [Mom] Jeremy is teaching Isaac.

143
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,099
Are you gonna try it?
- Yeah.

144
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:18,065
- I had to kinda show him
all the important stuff

145
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:21,148
you learn as a kid, to your children.

146
00:08:23,993 --> 00:08:25,554
- [Mom] That was good!

147
00:08:25,554 --> 00:08:26,735
- Did you go faster?
- Yeah.

148
00:08:26,735 --> 00:08:28,498
- I told ya!
- Thanks!

149
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:30,720
- You can practice and get
better and better at it.

150
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,970
Janae, Nae-Nae!

151
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:45,719
What's that?
(laughter)

152
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,839
- So there's this whole pool
area that we've enjoyed,

153
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,506
and now we're all just in the hot tub

154
00:08:49,506 --> 00:08:51,126
because it's nice and warm.

155
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,793
Are you playing with your Daddy?

156
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:01,637
I think aunts and uncles are
just cooler than parents.

157
00:09:01,637 --> 00:09:02,477
- It's true.

158
00:09:02,477 --> 00:09:05,214
- [Mom] But parents are
pretty nice, too, huh?

159
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:08,214
Huh, huh, was that a blowing a kiss?

160
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,000
- Watch, I have taught her, I'm starting

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,917
to teach her to kiss, Janae, watch.

162
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:27,495
She's getting it!

163
00:09:27,495 --> 00:09:29,242
(laughter)

164
00:09:29,242 --> 00:09:32,985
(fun upbeat music)

165
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:34,768
- So, Laura does the cutest thing.

166
00:09:34,768 --> 00:09:36,906
In the middle of swimming,
she gets out, she dries off,

167
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:38,224
and then she gets back in the water.

168
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:39,152
And she always says the same thing,

169
00:09:39,152 --> 00:09:40,364
"I'm just gonna dry off a little,

170
00:09:40,364 --> 00:09:41,565
"I'm gettin' a little too wet."

171
00:09:41,565 --> 00:09:44,221
- I get a little too wet.
- Do you get a little too wet?

172
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,654
Are you ready to keep swimming?

173
00:09:45,654 --> 00:09:48,571
(fun upbeat music)

174
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,338
We all fit in the hot tub, yay!

175
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:57,341
Maximum capacity is eight,

176
00:09:57,341 --> 00:09:59,611
and that's exactly how
many we are right now.

177
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:01,341
Well, it's just fun and novel to go

178
00:10:01,341 --> 00:10:02,868
to the pool when it's cold outside.

179
00:10:02,868 --> 00:10:04,718
The kids had a great time
and now we're gonna go home

180
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:07,253
and watch a movie and eat dinner.

181
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:09,359
So we came out shopping
tonight, we're at Nickel & Suede

182
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,107
checking out some
earrings, we had to get 'em

183
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:12,986
while she's in town,
so we're looking at all

184
00:10:12,986 --> 00:10:15,912
the different varieties, yes.
- Trying to decide.

185
00:10:15,912 --> 00:10:18,251
So many good options.
- But it's so cozy in here.

186
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:21,584
(cheerful upbeat music)

187
00:10:32,035 --> 00:10:34,129
It's a cute hat.
- I like it a lot.

188
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:34,962
- Me, too.

189
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,812
So our swim time ended
with a scary moment.

190
00:10:37,812 --> 00:10:40,358
I was out of the water
and I was changing Janae,

191
00:10:40,358 --> 00:10:41,805
most everybody else was out of the water,

192
00:10:41,805 --> 00:10:43,516
I had already gotten
Laura out of the water,

193
00:10:43,516 --> 00:10:45,681
her floatie was off and I'd
dried her, all of a sudden

194
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:49,090
I hear Elise say "Laura, Laura!"
and I spin around and Laura

195
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,722
had decided to get back in
the water and play some more.

196
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:55,444
Was it scary?

197
00:10:55,444 --> 00:10:58,577
So she ended up in the
deeper part of the water,

198
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:01,307
is where she had climbed back
in, and when I looked over

199
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:04,110
her head was just above water
and then I saw her go below.

200
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:06,938
I ran to the edge of the pool, jumped in,

201
00:11:06,938 --> 00:11:09,037
shoes on and everything, and grabbed her.

202
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,879
She said "The water, I
just didn't know the water

203
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,760
"was so tall," and sometimes, you know,

204
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,194
kids just don't realize things.

205
00:11:15,194 --> 00:11:18,370
It's crazy how fast things
can happen around water.

206
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,646
Just be so careful, we
always try to be careful.

207
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,237
We always try to have
plenty of adults and wear

208
00:11:23,237 --> 00:11:26,382
flotation devices and keep
an eye on them, but you know,

209
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:28,966
that split second you turn
around it can be really scary.

210
00:11:28,966 --> 00:11:31,836
I am feeling extra grateful
for this little one.

211
00:11:31,836 --> 00:11:36,003
(upbeat music)
- Goodnight, J House Out.

212
00:11:39,758 --> 00:11:42,806
- Today we're gonna do
the 100 Layers Challenge.

213
00:11:42,806 --> 00:11:45,944
We're gonna be putting
100 shirts on Caleb.

214
00:11:45,944 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
