1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:02,943
- The treasure hunt is ready!

2
00:00:02,943 --> 00:00:06,610
(joyful instrumental music)

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,267
- [Man] Oh!

4
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:16,600
(air whooshing)

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,658
- [Man] You normally make
your bed in the morning.

6
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:19,491
- Yeah.

7
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:22,490
- But as soon as he wakes up
every day, he makes his bed.

8
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,060
We'll see if we can
somehow have that rub off

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,479
on all the other kids.

10
00:00:25,479 --> 00:00:28,562
(happy guitar music)

11
00:00:32,588 --> 00:00:35,091
(cereal falls into bowl)

12
00:00:35,091 --> 00:00:35,970
(baby coos)

13
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,380
- [Man] Did someone just wake up?

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,838
She's just saying good
morning to everybody.

15
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:41,755
- Da da da.

16
00:00:42,598 --> 00:00:43,636
- [Girl] Hi.

17
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:47,406
♪ It's a hard knock life for us ♪

18
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:51,260
♪ It's a hard knock life for us ♪

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,818
♪ Instead of treated we get tricked ♪

20
00:00:54,818 --> 00:00:58,878
♪ Instead of kisses we get kicked ♪

21
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,399
♪ It's a hard knock life ♪

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,149
- Bye Mom, bye Addison, bye
Jennae, bye Elise, bye Caleb.

23
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,763
- [Woman] Bye Laura, have fun.

24
00:01:09,763 --> 00:01:10,596
- Mwah.

25
00:01:10,596 --> 00:01:12,400
- This morning Laura is coming with me

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,731
to run an important errand.

27
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:17,981
(fun electronic music)

28
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:28,753
- [Man] t.Loft.

29
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:32,540
- Weee.

30
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,350
- [Man] Finally today Kendra
and I are picking up something

31
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,660
we've wanted to pick up for a long time.

32
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,100
You got it?

33
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,050
Thanks for helping.

34
00:01:41,732 --> 00:01:44,982
(fun electronic music)

35
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:47,750
Isaac, what are you doing?

36
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,740
- I'm making a treasure hunt.

37
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,163
The treasure hunt is ready!

38
00:01:52,163 --> 00:01:55,500
(fast instrumental music)

39
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,154
- The first clue is fun, swish!

40
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:00,650
(feet hitting floor)

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,490
Nope.

42
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,553
- Just a drawing.

43
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:04,740
- [Boy] Uh, let's go.

44
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,963
- Right up there!

45
00:02:08,846 --> 00:02:10,513
My favorite show is on the... TV!

46
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,170
(baby laughing)

47
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,840
- I love apples.

48
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,673
I want one.

49
00:02:17,673 --> 00:02:18,813
Can you find one?

50
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:22,850
- [Girl] Maybe it's on an apple.

51
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,757
Oh, right there!

52
00:02:24,757 --> 00:02:27,360
(clock ticking)

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,193
- Nope.

54
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:32,309
(gasps) Yeah!

55
00:02:32,309 --> 00:02:33,705
- Wait, wait, wait.

56
00:02:33,705 --> 00:02:34,827
You found it.

57
00:02:34,827 --> 00:02:37,339
Everyone gets something.

58
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:38,672
- Yeah!

59
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:39,505
Thank you!

60
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,780
You are the best brother ever!

61
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,741
- It's my candy from Chuck E.
Cheese, but I have too much

62
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,513
and it's taking forever.

63
00:02:47,513 --> 00:02:50,528
(joyful music)

64
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:51,619
- [Girl] Wah!

65
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:54,489
(man laughs)

66
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:55,322
- Wah!

67
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:01,698
(kids screaming)

68
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:03,685
- Mmm.
- [Man] Do you like it?

69
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:04,518
- I like it.

70
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,613
- [Man] Did you put some makeup on?

71
00:03:06,724 --> 00:03:07,686
Looking good.

72
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:09,870
We're giving the kids our
leftovers of an Indian restaurant

73
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,780
that we went to.

74
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,400
So this is your first time
you guys to try Indian food,

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,809
like from India.

76
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:15,642
- [Boy] I love it.

77
00:03:15,642 --> 00:03:17,780
- [Man] We got the tiki marsala

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,160
- I love it.
- [Man] and butter chicken

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,400
which is like a coconut
- I'd say it's--

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,780
- tomato with Indian herbs and spices.

81
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,343
- I'd say it's a little bit spicy.

82
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:27,566
- [Man] Is it a little bit spicy?

83
00:03:27,566 --> 00:03:28,446
- Mm-hmm.

84
00:03:28,446 --> 00:03:29,279
- But it's good.

85
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:30,112
- [Man] Okay.

86
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:30,945
- I want to go there.

87
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,370
- So let us know in the
poll if you have had

88
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,630
and like Indian food.

89
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,380
- So over the last couple
months Jeremy and I have fallen

90
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,780
into some less healthy patterns.

91
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,790
Just eating more sweets and
treats, more french fries,

92
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,560
eating out more and so
we're really excited

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,740
to start, kind of jump
start our health goals

94
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,340
with doing a cleanse this week.

95
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,461
For the next two days,

96
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:51,650
we're gonna drink these awesome juices

97
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,110
and eat these healthy salads

98
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,920
and I'm really excited
and a little bit nervous.

99
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,850
We want more energy.

100
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,370
We want to take care of our bodies better

101
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,280
and so we're doing this for two days.

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,113
Hopefully it goes okay.

103
00:04:01,113 --> 00:04:03,610
So the cleanse comes
with this cleanse guide

104
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,850
and it tells you when to drink what.

105
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:09,380
So we're starting off with Juice 1

106
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,180
and that's the mean and clean.

107
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,295
So we just find Juice 1.

108
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,343
(shakes juice)

109
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:16,510
So this is really good,

110
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,660
it tastes like a carrot orange juice,

111
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,959
which is one of my favorites.

112
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,520
- So Kendra and I have done this before,

113
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,689
but it was a long time ago,
like a year or two ago.

114
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:26,606
- It was before Jennae.

115
00:04:27,873 --> 00:04:29,400
- This is a good one.

116
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,700
- So with the cleanse we're also supposed

117
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,644
to drink a lot of water, hydrating today.

118
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:34,477
(air whooshes)

119
00:04:34,477 --> 00:04:35,946
- [Jeremy] Are you on the trampoline?

120
00:04:35,946 --> 00:04:36,949
- Yep.

121
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,035
(baby laughs)

122
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:42,110
(tongue clicking)

123
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,090
- [Jeremy] You thinking about a doggy?

124
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,703
Nae Nae when she thinks
about a dog, oh you signing?

125
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,360
Dog, dog.

126
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,744
She'll make a dog noise.

127
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:52,741
(imitates dog barking)

128
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:54,073
That's her bark.

129
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:57,370
(girl laughs)

130
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,820
Nae Nae is watching her
brothers play basketball.

131
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,760
So I'm on drink four, I get one more drink

132
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,550
and I have a salad coming up.

133
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,170
- Well I'm snuggling Jennae this morning

134
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,760
and she is doing so much more signing

135
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,010
with her baby sign language.

136
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,540
It's so cute to see it.

137
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,280
Let's see if she'll show
it off for you guys.

138
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,193
All right, Nae Nae, can you sign hat?

139
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,860
Hat, good job!

140
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,500
Can you say please?

141
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,966
Please, aww, that's so sweet.

142
00:05:25,966 --> 00:05:28,360
So, so far Jennae signs hat, dad,

143
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,150
although I think sometimes she
gets those like interchanged,

144
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:32,470
cuz they both are on the top of her head.

145
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,020
She signs please, eat, more, shoes.

146
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,410
It's just really fun to
see her start signing.

147
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,210
I've loved this stage with all of my kids

148
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,770
because all of a sudden you get

149
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,629
to see what they're thinking about.

150
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:45,462
- Try to stop him.

151
00:05:45,462 --> 00:05:48,272
(smacks)
(laughs)

152
00:05:48,272 --> 00:05:50,671
- No, Caleb, get it!

153
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,184
Get open.

154
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,240
(smacks)
(laughs)

155
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,360
(gentle guitar music)

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,208
- [Jeremy] These boys are
playing basketball all the time.

157
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,410
(chimes ring)
Ohh, good shot.

158
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,150
- I'm gonna quiz Caleb
on some of his Spanish.

159
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,550
La manzana.

160
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:08,383
- Apple.

161
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,671
- Apple, are you ready?

162
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:10,504
- Mm-hmm.

163
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:12,018
- Okay, pig.

164
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:12,935
- La cerdo.

165
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,433
- Is it el cerdo?

166
00:06:16,416 --> 00:06:17,780
- Somethin' like that.

167
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,880
- Bread.

168
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,778
- El pan.

169
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,330
- El pan, how bout milk?

170
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:22,570
- La leche.

171
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,219
- [Jeremy] How bout taco?

172
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,559
- I haven't learned that yet.

173
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,563
(laughs)

174
00:06:26,563 --> 00:06:27,693
- It's just taco.

175
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,386
- [Jeremy] Or maybe
it's ticky-toe. (laughs)

176
00:06:30,386 --> 00:06:31,559
- He's like what?

177
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,392
(air whooshes)

178
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,930
Elise and I are going to
my freezer group today.

179
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,830
So in two hours we are
gonna try to make 19 meals

180
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,560
to put in our freezer,
so that we can eat them

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,150
on all of our busy days.

182
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,983
That's the goal.

183
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:45,830
This is the recipe we
are working on first.

184
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,228
- Toe-kitos?

185
00:06:47,228 --> 00:06:48,189
- [Kendra] Taquitos.

186
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,022
- Taquitos.

187
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:52,560
- [Kendra] Yum, kay, we
need the jar of green salsa.

188
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,910
Can you open it?

189
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,768
- [Woman's Voice] Oh shoot,
I forgot to buy red peppers.

190
00:06:55,768 --> 00:06:56,601
I just went out--

191
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,230
- [Kendra] Gotta twist it, twist it hard.

192
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,063
- Which way?

193
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:00,793
- [Kendra] Do you want some help?

194
00:07:00,793 --> 00:07:01,862
- Yeah.

195
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,330
- [Kendra] Okay, this is on really tight.

196
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,216
Ahh, got it.

197
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,633
(calm music)

198
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,450
So we're chopping three
bunches of cilantro

199
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,660
with the food processor.

200
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,754
Ready, press pulse.

201
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:18,004
(grinding)

202
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:22,790
- It's such a strong smell.

203
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,260
- [Kendra] I love it.

204
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,093
Do you like it?

205
00:07:25,093 --> 00:07:26,460
- A little bit.

206
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,430
- [Kendra] Now we're
adding the cream cheese.

207
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,263
You ready for this?

208
00:07:29,263 --> 00:07:31,082
Go for it, yeah.

209
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:34,915
(cheerful instrumental music)

210
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:37,861
Are the gloves a little too big?

211
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:42,861
- Yeah, totally.

212
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,760
I like this job.

213
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,300
- [Kendra] It looks disgusting,
but it tastes really yummy.

214
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,703
We added pepper jack
cheese and now chicken.

215
00:07:52,408 --> 00:07:56,241
(cheerful instrumental music)

216
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,590
So we're shredding the
chicken in the mixer.

217
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,873
Super fast and easy.

218
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:02,902
- It's a mountain of cheese and chicken.

219
00:08:02,902 --> 00:08:05,452
- [Kendra] It is, it is truly a mountain.

220
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,619
(cheery violin music)

221
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,020
I'm really stocking up on meals this month

222
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,100
because my freezer is almost
empty of freezer meals

223
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,950
and because I like to have a few on hand

224
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,630
that if someone needs a
meal, like a neighbor,

225
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,200
I can take them something that's easy

226
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,060
and I've got the stuff.

227
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,211
So I got three of these
red and white pastas.

228
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:27,260
We'll eat some and we'll
probably share some too.

229
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,830
Well we did it in two
hours, we made 19 meals

230
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,080
that we can go home and put in our freezer

231
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,270
and I love that because then on busy days

232
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,809
when I don't have time to
make a home-cooked meal,

233
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:37,089
I can pull it out and I
know it's a yummy meal

234
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:37,980
for my family.

235
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,320
Anyway, the average works out
to be about eleven dollars

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,280
per meal which is so much
cheaper than taking our family

237
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,825
to eat out and healthier, too.

238
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,658
(air whooshes)

239
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,121
- Last night we watched
Singing in the Rain.

240
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,157
- [Jeremy] And that's making
you want to tap dance?

241
00:08:49,157 --> 00:08:50,969
(feet tapping)

242
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,719
(delicate music)

243
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,793
Good shot.

244
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,960
- What?
- [Jeremy] Good shot.

245
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,910
- So we just had our first
family lesson about how

246
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,790
to conjugate verbs in Spanish.

247
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,070
It actually went really well.

248
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,020
It's just the very
beginning, I mean conjugation

249
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,110
is such a big thing.

250
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,570
Which verb are you working on?

251
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,513
- Nadar.

252
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,900
- [Kendra] What does that mean?

253
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,960
- Sing.

254
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,630
- [Kendra] Not to sing.

255
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,167
- Um, swim.

256
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:16,410
- [Kendra] Swim.

257
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,680
Good work, good work.

258
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,540
- Now tu would go like this.

259
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,180
- [Kendra] Very good, very good.

260
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't forget tu, the u has an accent

261
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,690
on top of it, like that.

262
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,448
- [Jeremy] You working on your Spanish?

263
00:09:29,448 --> 00:09:31,940
You're probably gonna know
Spanish better than any

264
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,548
of us if we work on it with you.

265
00:09:34,548 --> 00:09:37,313
(happy guitar music)

266
00:09:37,313 --> 00:09:38,146
(laughs)

267
00:09:38,146 --> 00:09:38,979
This girl is so helpful.

268
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,510
She helped us clean up dinner

269
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:43,060
and she got her jammies on real quick.

270
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,730
Isaac's helping us out right
now, putting away some food.

271
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,750
So we've done dinner,
we've cleaned up and Kendra

272
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,920
and I are going to eat
our salad that is part

273
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,310
of the cleanse we're doing

274
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:53,750
and then we'll continue
on with this tomorrow.

275
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,910
Thanks for watching today.

276
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,284
J House out.

277
00:09:56,284 --> 00:09:59,451
(upbeat violin music)

278
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,216
- [Girl] Eight, nine, ten.

279
00:10:05,660 --> 00:00:00,000
Here I come.
