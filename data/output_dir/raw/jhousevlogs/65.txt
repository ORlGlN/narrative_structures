1
00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:01,888
- Let the games begin.

2
00:00:01,888 --> 00:00:05,058
(triumphant music)

3
00:00:05,058 --> 00:00:06,085
- [Jeremy] There it goes.

4
00:00:06,085 --> 00:00:09,714
(triumphant music)

5
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:10,547
- [Jeremy] Making it beautiful.

6
00:00:10,547 --> 00:00:12,005
- Trying to make it look different.

7
00:00:12,005 --> 00:00:13,853
- And so we're doing a little photo shoot.

8
00:00:13,853 --> 00:00:15,875
- [Gillian] Um... (giggles).

9
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:19,436
(triumphant music)

10
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:22,269
(cereal crunches)

11
00:00:26,214 --> 00:00:27,485
- [Jeremy] How'd you sleep last night?

12
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,063
- Who got the flowers?
- Good.

13
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,484
- [Jeremy] Laura picked them out for mom

14
00:00:30,484 --> 00:00:32,156
when we went shopping.

15
00:00:32,156 --> 00:00:33,161
How'd you sleep?

16
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:33,994
- Good.

17
00:00:33,994 --> 00:00:37,274
(laughing) Come on, we're
all eating breakfast.

18
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:39,080
(cereal crunches)

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,630
So what happened to your finger?

20
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,996
- I sprained it while playing dodgeball.

21
00:00:42,996 --> 00:00:43,954
- [Jeremy] And then at school

22
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,318
they wrapped it up for you, right?

23
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:46,151
- Yeah.

24
00:00:46,151 --> 00:00:47,401
- [Jeremy] Well, how's it feeling today?

25
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,468
- Normal, just be as it's under this.

26
00:00:50,468 --> 00:00:51,786
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna take that off?

27
00:00:51,786 --> 00:00:52,827
- Yeah.
- 'Kay.

28
00:00:52,827 --> 00:00:55,040
- So I can wash my hands.

29
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,450
- [Jeremy] Just try and move
it and how is it feeling?

30
00:00:58,450 --> 00:00:59,301
(Caleb sighs)

31
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:01,002
Does it hurt still?

32
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:01,960
- Yeah.

33
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,944
- [Jeremy] I'm sorry it hurts so bad.

34
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,049
- Yeah.

35
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:07,632
(upbeat music)

36
00:01:13,046 --> 00:01:15,915
- [Jeremy] Good job folding, team.

37
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:17,275
You dancing?

38
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:18,108
Yeah.

39
00:01:19,025 --> 00:01:20,455
(Janae exclaims happily)

40
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,713
- [Kendra] Do you want a ponytail?

41
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:22,546
- Sure.

42
00:01:23,382 --> 00:01:25,950
But that'll come out in
a little bit, right mom?

43
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,362
- [Kendra] Yep, at the end of
the day, we'll take it out.

44
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:29,195
- Yep.

45
00:01:29,195 --> 00:01:30,584
- So it's back to out
routines this morning.

46
00:01:30,584 --> 00:01:31,857
The kids are at piano lessons,

47
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,403
and then they have gymnastics tonight.

48
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:35,513
But we're not sure what
Isaac's going to be able to do

49
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:37,558
with his pinky, it's really hurting him.

50
00:01:37,558 --> 00:01:39,558
- [Jeremy] Is Granny Jo showing
you how to play the guitar?

51
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:41,267
- Yep.
- Kind of.

52
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,434
(playful piano music)

53
00:01:56,644 --> 00:01:58,528
- One, two, ready go.

54
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,237
(slow piano music)

55
00:02:02,237 --> 00:02:05,913
- [Jeremy] I love that you're
playing the piano, buddy.

56
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:07,663
That's a pretty song.

57
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:13,600
He plays with the pedal.

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,587
- It is so cold out here.

59
00:02:15,587 --> 00:02:17,732
The boys are getting their hair cut,

60
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:19,281
and us girls are headed
to the grocery store

61
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:20,759
'cause we need a few things.

62
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,263
We actually leave on our
trip in just two days,

63
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:24,733
so I don't wanna get a bunch of food,

64
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:25,950
but we still need food.

65
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:30,196
We are running into the
grocery store to keep warm.

66
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:33,041
Oh my goodness, you are so big.

67
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:33,995
(Granny Jo chuckles)

68
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,389
- [Elise] Girl party.

69
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,972
(upbeat music)

70
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:41,494
- So today for lunch, we're
having a chicken noodle soup

71
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,256
and some salad, and some of this bread,

72
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:46,119
which is an Asiago cheese
bread and they slice it for us.

73
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:47,378
This is not a good thing.

74
00:02:47,378 --> 00:02:50,080
I just discovered that the grocery store

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,319
sells my favorite kind of
cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory

76
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,539
which is, I know I'm a
very exciting person,

77
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,589
Vanilla Bean Cheesecake.

78
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:59,069
Oh that looks so good.

79
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:00,148
Check it out.

80
00:03:00,148 --> 00:03:03,042
Lisi, it's a football inside
of an end zone marker.

81
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:03,969
(Granny Jo laughs)

82
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,482
You see the outline?

83
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:06,315
- [Granny Jo] Look at that.

84
00:03:06,315 --> 00:03:07,741
- [Kendra] That is fun.

85
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,241
It's so fun having Granny Jo here

86
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,985
and having a extra set of hands to help

87
00:03:10,985 --> 00:03:13,431
and it's just fun to have family around.

88
00:03:13,431 --> 00:03:15,484
Elise loves loading up.

89
00:03:15,484 --> 00:03:18,067
(upbeat music)

90
00:03:24,476 --> 00:03:26,305
Ready to go home and eat lunch?

91
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,506
- Yeah.

92
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:30,089
(upbeat music)

93
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,319
- So with the new year starting,

94
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,038
I've seen lots of motivational,
inspirational quotes

95
00:03:36,038 --> 00:03:37,229
circulating around the internet,

96
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:39,341
and one of 'em just keeps
going through my mind,

97
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,917
and it says something about,

98
00:03:40,917 --> 00:03:43,987
do more of what makes you happy in 2018.

99
00:03:43,987 --> 00:03:45,303
So I read that, and I was really thinking,

100
00:03:45,303 --> 00:03:47,596
like, what is it that makes me happy?

101
00:03:47,596 --> 00:03:50,362
And honesty, I think the
things that make me happiest

102
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,415
are the little moments.

103
00:03:52,415 --> 00:03:55,078
Those little tiny moments with my family

104
00:03:55,078 --> 00:03:56,648
that sometimes I'm too busy for,

105
00:03:56,648 --> 00:03:59,425
or sometimes I push it
aside, or rush through,

106
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:02,674
and so I'm really trying
to savor those moments.

107
00:04:02,674 --> 00:04:06,542
So, I'm gonna take this moment
to read a book to Laura.

108
00:04:06,542 --> 00:04:07,875
Ooh, Good Night Gorilla.

109
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,189
Is that the one you want me to read you?

110
00:04:09,189 --> 00:04:10,407
- Yeah.

111
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:11,656
- [Kendra] It's a good pick.

112
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:14,534
Good Night Gorilla by Peggy Rathmann.

113
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:15,720
(kiss smacks gently)

114
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,553
Oh no.

115
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:19,377
We're doing some math today.

116
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:22,544
Caleb just started math using algebra.

117
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:24,940
So we're working on place value.

118
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,837
What's this number?

119
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,004
- [Caleb] 481.

120
00:04:28,256 --> 00:04:29,269
- [Kendra] Good job.

121
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,601
- [Jeremy] You guys playing Rack-O?

122
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,434
- Yeah.
- Yes.

123
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:33,938
This is a game I played when
I was growing up in Iroplain.

124
00:04:33,938 --> 00:04:36,210
Okay, so you take a card first.

125
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,009
- So, for Johnston Law, we
are here doing some pictures.

126
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:42,035
We have Gillian, she
does all of our pictures,

127
00:04:42,035 --> 00:04:43,079
And so she's helping us out.

128
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,105
We wanted to get stuff for our webpage

129
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,902
and the Johnston Law Facebook page,

130
00:04:46,902 --> 00:04:48,888
and so we're doing a little photo shoot.

131
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:51,973
We're trying to get some candid
shots that are really cool.

132
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:54,325
(upbeat music)

133
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:56,025
So we keep trying to do candid shots,

134
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:58,417
and Brett and I just
can't take it serious.

135
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,970
Gillian's like, "Don't smile."

136
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,107
(Gillian giggles)

137
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:02,274
I can't do it.

138
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,874
- [Gillian] All right, point
at something on the computer,

139
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:07,058
like it's interesting.
(camera shutter clicking)

140
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:07,891
- (chuckles) You gotta point.

141
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:10,429
- [Gillian] Not you Brett.

142
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,608
- I wonder if we should switch these.

143
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:13,460
It's a funny thing with pictures.

144
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,243
You're trying to make it look like,

145
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:18,207
totally casual and natural,
but it feels awkward.

146
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,109
- [Gillian] Yeah, stand
there for a minute.

147
00:05:20,109 --> 00:05:21,776
Do hands in pockets.

148
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:23,988
- Looking at you?

149
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:24,821
- My back pocket.

150
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:26,744
- [Gillian] Um, yeah (laughing).

151
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,327
- You're so stupid.

152
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:32,410
- [Gillian] Okay, don't smile.

153
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,243
(laughing)

154
00:05:33,243 --> 00:05:34,267
- Okay.
- Okay.

155
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,198
- This is why I wore
my short sleeve shirt.

156
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,572
- Are you flexing your forearms?

157
00:05:37,572 --> 00:05:38,912
- Yeah (laughing).

158
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:41,843
- [Gillian] Okay, now look at each other

159
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,698
and you can talk, no I
just mean, like talking,

160
00:05:43,698 --> 00:05:45,781
like have a conversation.

161
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:49,434
- Yeah, that's good.

162
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:51,341
(men laughing)

163
00:05:51,341 --> 00:05:54,057
- [Gillian] Fist bump, high five.

164
00:05:54,057 --> 00:05:55,793
- Someone just woke up from a nap.

165
00:05:55,793 --> 00:05:57,570
Did you have a good nap?

166
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,401
(Janae gurgles)
Yeah.

167
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,135
- That is so cool.

168
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:03,564
- [Kendra] So this is Isaac's team jersey.

169
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:05,110
And what do you love about your jersey?

170
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,397
- It's reversible.

171
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:08,853
- [Kendra] Show us how it works.

172
00:06:08,853 --> 00:06:11,055
Isaac went to his first
basketball practice last night

173
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,238
and he's going to have to miss
some while we're on our trip.

174
00:06:13,238 --> 00:06:15,941
But he's gonna come right back, nice.

175
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:16,892
Looking good.

176
00:06:16,892 --> 00:06:17,747
- So this isn't sponsored,

177
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,966
but we got an Osmo
coding game for the kids

178
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:22,835
so they can practice coding
in a real hands-on way.

179
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:23,952
What do you think about it Isaac?

180
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:26,053
- I love it, and I'm doing well.

181
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,275
- [Jeremy] Good job.

182
00:06:27,275 --> 00:06:28,494
So it's kind of like playing a video game

183
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,536
but you're coding, right?

184
00:06:29,536 --> 00:06:30,369
- [Isaac] It's that.

185
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:31,202
- [Jeremy] Ah, there it goes.

186
00:06:31,202 --> 00:06:33,535
Four, one, two, three, four.

187
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:37,967
So you coded him all the
way through the whole thing?

188
00:06:37,967 --> 00:06:39,779
- [Isaac] What?

189
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:40,988
- [Jeremy] Good job buddy.

190
00:06:40,988 --> 00:06:41,951
You playing with the play dough?

191
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,784
- [Laura] Mm hmm.

192
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:44,592
- I made a perfect cupcake.

193
00:06:44,592 --> 00:06:46,945
- [Jeremy] Let's see it.

194
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:47,981
Yummy.

195
00:06:47,981 --> 00:06:51,064
(gentle piano music)

196
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,808
This is cool, is this a fire hydrant?

197
00:06:58,808 --> 00:06:59,641
- [Laura] Mm hmm.

198
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:00,529
- [Jeremy] And you have
water coming out of it?

199
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,747
- [Laura] Mm hmm.

200
00:07:01,747 --> 00:07:03,185
Well basically,
- This is genius.

201
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:04,969
You playing with your Granny Jo?

202
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:06,579
- [Granny Jo] This little
piggy went to market,

203
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:08,015
this little piggy stayed home.

204
00:07:08,015 --> 00:07:09,325
This piggy had roast beef,

205
00:07:09,325 --> 00:07:10,442
this piggy had none.

206
00:07:10,442 --> 00:07:11,669
This piggy went, "wee,
wee, wee, wee, wee,"

207
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:13,387
all the way home.

208
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:14,781
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

209
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,010
What's crazy is I can
actually remember my mom

210
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:19,719
doing that game with me as a little kid.

211
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,080
- [Granny Jo] Patty cake,
patty cake, baker's man.

212
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,385
Bake me a cake as fast as you can.

213
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:27,552
Pat it, and roll it, mark it with a J,

214
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:32,801
and throw it the oven for Janae today.

215
00:07:32,801 --> 00:07:34,367
- Yay.
- That's fun.

216
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,836
- So we're doing our very final
undecorating of Christmas.

217
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:38,669
- [Jeremy] That's right.

218
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:40,449
So we're taking down the
wreath, and the lights,

219
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:42,135
and Elise is my little helper.

220
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:42,968
- Yep.

221
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:43,801
- [Jeremy] Let's do it.

222
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:46,718
(triumphant music)

223
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,524
- Laura is challenging Granny Jo.

224
00:07:55,524 --> 00:07:56,810
- 'Kay, what do we say?

225
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,394
Let the games begin.

226
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,227
Ah!

227
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:01,098
(pucks clacking)
Oh!

228
00:08:01,098 --> 00:08:02,168
Oh!

229
00:08:02,168 --> 00:08:04,918
(pucks clacking)

230
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,822
- C, E flat, A flat, G.

231
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:13,714
C, E flat, A flat, G.

232
00:08:13,714 --> 00:08:16,631
(slow piano music)

233
00:08:18,392 --> 00:08:19,475
Yeah.

234
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:20,308
- This is awesome.

235
00:08:20,308 --> 00:08:21,141
- [Jeremy] So you do that part,

236
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:21,974
- Yeah, it's called fute.
- Now watch,

237
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:24,310
watch Caleb, watch what
Granny Jo's gonna do.

238
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,477
(playful piano music)

239
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:35,804
- This is awesome!

240
00:08:35,804 --> 00:08:36,919
- It is awesome.

241
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:40,083
(playful piano music)
(basketball thudding)

242
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:41,130
- [Caleb] This is awesome.

243
00:08:41,131 --> 00:08:42,712
- [Granny Jo] Yeah, so we're gonna go...

244
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:43,937
- [Jeremy] (laughing) Yeah!

245
00:08:43,938 --> 00:08:45,707
How's your pinky feel?

246
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,528
- It's feeling fine,
but it's still a sprain.

247
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,036
- So I have these cute sandals,

248
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:51,520
and since we're going somewhere warm,

249
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,583
I was thinking we could try 'em on her.

250
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,809
She doesn't know what to do with them?

251
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,457
- [Jeremy] Have we told
them where we're going yet?

252
00:08:56,457 --> 00:08:57,827
- I haven't.

253
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:58,660
Have you told 'em?

254
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,493
- No.

255
00:08:59,493 --> 00:09:00,326
- Have you told 'em?

256
00:09:00,326 --> 00:09:01,900
- [Jeremy] No, don't tell 'em Nae Nae.

257
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,721
She's thinking about it.

258
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:04,936
- She doesn't know what to do with it.

259
00:09:04,936 --> 00:09:06,219
Okay, I got 'ya.

260
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:08,369
Jeremy's family is over
here for dinner tonight

261
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:10,512
and we did pizza and it smells so good

262
00:09:10,512 --> 00:09:11,959
'cause I am so hungry.

263
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,048
- We have pepperoni, supreme,

264
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:18,215
bacon, chicken and tomato, and cheese.

265
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,029
(gentle whipping)

266
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:23,338
And Kendra's, we're hiding
it over here for Kendra.

267
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,260
- So Isaac recently had a growth spurt,

268
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,520
which we're really happy for him,

269
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,716
but unfortunately, it
feels like overnight,

270
00:09:28,716 --> 00:09:30,506
he outgrew all of his pants.

271
00:09:30,506 --> 00:09:32,395
And so I am headed to the store,

272
00:09:32,395 --> 00:09:33,708
because in order to pack clothes,

273
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,649
I need to have clothes that fit him.

274
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:38,028
So hopefully I can find some pants for him

275
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:39,585
and a few other things.

276
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:41,137
It's cold out.

277
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,720
(upbeat music)

278
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,384
- [Jeremy] How's your pinky feeling?

279
00:09:59,384 --> 00:10:00,497
- Good.
- Okay.

280
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:03,170
- The only the only hard part
was the around the world.

281
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,245
- [Jeremy] How did it go?

282
00:10:04,245 --> 00:10:05,078
- Good.

283
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:06,177
- [Jeremy] Hey, what are you guys doing?

284
00:10:06,177 --> 00:10:07,920
- Making her hair look nice.

285
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,806
- [Jeremy] You're making it beautiful.

286
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,515
- We're trying to make it look different.

287
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:11,348
- I did like a twist.

288
00:10:11,348 --> 00:10:13,050
- [Caleb] Maybe we should
cut those bangs off.

289
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,370
(Granny Jo laughs)

290
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,991
- [Jeremy] (laughing)
Gotta cut them bangs.

291
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,722
Princess Leia hair.

292
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:18,722
- Oh there you go.

293
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:19,765
- [Jeremy] How was violin?

294
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:20,598
- Good.

295
00:10:20,598 --> 00:10:22,291
- [Jeremy] I'm so glad
you're doing violin, bud.

296
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,134
- Good night.

297
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,655
J House out.

298
00:10:24,655 --> 00:10:26,511
- Some of our pipes are frozen.

299
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,593
- [Jeremy] Get him!

300
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:29,573
(Jeremy laughing)

301
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,673
- [Kendra] Laura is
getting ready for the den.

302
00:10:31,673 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat rock music)
