1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,767
(light music)
- Yeah!

2
00:00:01,767 --> 00:00:04,791
- This is what I'm talkin' 'bout, baby!

3
00:00:04,791 --> 00:00:06,382
- [Kendra] So much pumpkin spice here.

4
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:07,868
- Could we buy some?

5
00:00:07,868 --> 00:00:10,655
- Never shop hungry or you'll
buy really yummy stuff!

6
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:11,488
Whoa!

7
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:13,109
That is a huge nest.

8
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:14,074
Did you guys see this?

9
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:15,251
- You spent all my money!

10
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:16,084
(he laughs)

11
00:00:16,084 --> 00:00:19,328
(light music)

12
00:00:19,328 --> 00:00:22,448
(baby making noises)

13
00:00:22,448 --> 00:00:23,965
(laughing)

14
00:00:23,965 --> 00:00:27,048
(baby making noises)

15
00:00:29,306 --> 00:00:30,845
- [Kendra] The laugh that's almost a cry.

16
00:00:30,845 --> 00:00:31,693
- [Jeremy] She's tired.

17
00:00:31,693 --> 00:00:32,526
- [Kendra] 'Kay, ready?

18
00:00:32,526 --> 00:00:33,452
Stand up!

19
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:35,082
- Come on.

20
00:00:35,082 --> 00:00:35,915
Come on.

21
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:39,233
Yeah!

22
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:40,359
(Kendra laughs)

23
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,991
- You're walking!

24
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,941
You're walking!
- What are doing?

25
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:45,056
- [Jeremy] You're walking!

26
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,529
- [Kendra] (laughs) She loves it.

27
00:00:46,529 --> 00:00:49,038
So Jeremy's pulling just a little bit

28
00:00:49,038 --> 00:00:51,387
and she is takin' steps!

29
00:00:51,387 --> 00:00:52,220
- Yay!

30
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,318
Yeah, she was giving me five this morning.

31
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,151
- [Kendra] She does everything.

32
00:00:58,151 --> 00:00:59,707
She's like a full-fledged kid.

33
00:00:59,707 --> 00:01:02,413
She's like, I may be eight
months old, but I'm a human.

34
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:03,544
- [Jeremy] She reads already.

35
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:04,791
(Kendra laughs)

36
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:05,919
Gimme five.

37
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:08,276
- [Kendra] Well, time to
start helping with the chores.

38
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:09,644
- You walked.

39
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:12,311
(piano playing)

40
00:01:26,515 --> 00:01:27,735
- We're headed to the grocery store.

41
00:01:27,735 --> 00:01:28,568
Check it out.

42
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:31,007
I got the best parking spot!

43
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,826
Front row, it's amazing!

44
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,025
It's amazing how a little thing

45
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:36,349
like a really good
parking spot can get you

46
00:01:36,349 --> 00:01:38,076
really excited and pump
you up for the day.

47
00:01:38,076 --> 00:01:39,661
That's our van!

48
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:41,205
Isn't that the best parking spot ever?

49
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:42,354
It just feels great.

50
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:43,857
We are making dinner for some neighbors

51
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:46,411
that are sick tonight
and so I need to pick up

52
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,614
some stuff from the store.

53
00:01:47,614 --> 00:01:49,315
You don't want any bruising on 'em.

54
00:01:49,315 --> 00:01:50,505
You don't want 'em too green.

55
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:52,645
(happy music)

56
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:53,784
Those are really green.

57
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:54,617
- I know.

58
00:01:54,617 --> 00:01:55,450
I just like 'em.

59
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,344
- [Kendra] It does look
cool but I don't know

60
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,650
if you'd wanna eat 'em.

61
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,057
My favorite salad's on sale.

62
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:03,756
We're gonna get this one to
go with our dinner tonight.

63
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,441
You wanna grab another one, Lisey?

64
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:08,145
- So with having five kids,
we know it's so important

65
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,560
to find time one on one with each kid.

66
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:12,480
So right now Caleb and I--

67
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,896
- [Both] Are gonna build--

68
00:02:13,896 --> 00:02:15,705
- A dump truck kit!

69
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:16,538
- [Jeremy] That's right.

70
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:18,990
(energetic music)

71
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,506
(tool drilling)

72
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:21,984
Good job, buddy.

73
00:02:21,984 --> 00:02:25,405
(energetic music)

74
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:26,676
(tool drilling)

75
00:02:26,676 --> 00:02:28,739
So Caleb, did we make a little mistake?

76
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,572
Yeah.

77
00:02:29,572 --> 00:02:31,111
Right at the start, our
very first thing we did,

78
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:32,838
we did wrong, but we've fixed it.

79
00:02:32,838 --> 00:02:34,216
How did we fix it?

80
00:02:34,216 --> 00:02:37,363
- We took it off and
put it on the right one.

81
00:02:37,363 --> 00:02:38,196
- [Jeremy] That's right.

82
00:02:38,196 --> 00:02:41,029
(energetic music)

83
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:49,141
- This is what I'm talkin' 'bout, baby!

84
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,177
- [Jeremy] This is a toy for
eight year olds and older.

85
00:02:52,177 --> 00:02:53,738
- I guess I'm a good builder.

86
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:54,894
- [Jeremy] I guess you are.

87
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:55,840
Is that the dump truck?

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,191
- [Caleb] Mm hm.

89
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,024
- [Jeremy] Alright.

90
00:02:58,024 --> 00:02:58,857
Let's go finish our dump truck.

91
00:02:58,857 --> 00:03:01,111
- [Kendra] Look how
cute these cookies are!

92
00:03:01,111 --> 00:03:02,815
- [Elise] I want to be a pilgrim.

93
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,837
- You like the pilgrim one?

94
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:04,819
So Jeremy and I have been watching

95
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:08,018
the British Cooking Baking
Show and so I feel like

96
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,241
all these fancy things, I'm
just wanting to try them all.

97
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,306
Oh, my goodness, guys!

98
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:13,737
Look at these!

99
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:14,863
Look at them!

100
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,239
Oh, they're beautiful!

101
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,816
Look at this baklava.

102
00:03:17,816 --> 00:03:19,675
Look it's a pecan creme tart.

103
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:21,342
Ooh, look at these caramel apples.

104
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:22,925
Look at this red velvet one!

105
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:23,758
Oh, look!

106
00:03:23,758 --> 00:03:24,591
These are little pretzels!

107
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:26,154
- [Isaac] I like all the donuts.

108
00:03:26,154 --> 00:03:27,263
- You're a donut dude?

109
00:03:27,263 --> 00:03:29,327
So I've been doing most of
my grocery shopping online

110
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,847
so we haven't been coming to
the store as much with my kids

111
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:33,874
and it's been a good review
today to be here together

112
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:36,984
because we're remembering our
manners at the grocery store

113
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:39,105
and we are also remembering other things

114
00:03:39,105 --> 00:03:40,260
that you learn at the grocery store,

115
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,810
like how to tell when fruit is ripe

116
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,196
and how to look for the
best deal on something.

117
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:47,412
For example, this can
of black beans is $1.28

118
00:03:47,412 --> 00:03:49,858
but this can of black beans,
how much is that one, Lisey?

119
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,788
- 79.

120
00:03:50,788 --> 00:03:52,527
- [Kendra] 79 cents.

121
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:53,540
- Hey, that's cheaper!

122
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,373
- [Kendra] Yep.

123
00:03:54,373 --> 00:03:55,267
What does this remind you guys of?

124
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:56,806
- [Kids] Pumpkin spice challenge.

125
00:03:56,806 --> 00:03:58,925
- [Kendra] There is so
much pumpkin spice here.

126
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:00,397
- Could we buy some?

127
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:01,578
- [Kendra] I think we
have enough pumpkin spice

128
00:04:01,578 --> 00:04:03,372
to last us forever.

129
00:04:03,372 --> 00:04:07,052
(peaceful music)
- Shhhh.

130
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:08,513
Drop.

131
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:10,680
(sanding)

132
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:14,633
- [Jeremy] You're trying to sand it?

133
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:17,300
(truck rolling)

134
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:19,156
(objects dropping)

135
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:19,989
There we go.

136
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:20,822
It dumps.

137
00:04:20,822 --> 00:04:23,866
- Let's go pick up some more trash.

138
00:04:23,866 --> 00:04:24,816
- [Kendra] So we're
teaching 'em how to look at

139
00:04:24,816 --> 00:04:26,565
the dates on the milk.

140
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:27,636
The bakery gives out cookies

141
00:04:27,636 --> 00:04:29,396
to the kids while we're shoppin'.

142
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:30,745
Are you excited that you're still a kid?

143
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:31,578
- Mm hm.

144
00:04:31,578 --> 00:04:33,047
- In not too long, you're
gonna be a big person

145
00:04:33,047 --> 00:04:34,916
and then you're gonna be
like me and not get a cookie.

146
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,350
I'm in a moment of weakness and I got

147
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,624
one of these sugar cookies.

148
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,872
It's decorated like pumpkin pie!

149
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:40,132
It's so cute!

150
00:04:40,132 --> 00:04:42,746
This is just a friendly
reminder, never shop hungry

151
00:04:42,746 --> 00:04:44,550
or you'll buy really yummy stuff.

152
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,383
Mm.
- Have a good day.

153
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:46,216
- [Kendra] Thank you, you too.

154
00:04:46,216 --> 00:04:49,180
- When you're shopping with
Mum, you buy a ton of sweets

155
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,261
because she has a sugar tooth.

156
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:52,094
- [Kendra] Is that true?

157
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:52,927
- Mm hm.

158
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:54,668
- I also bought lots of fruits and veggies

159
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,637
but here's the thing.

160
00:04:55,637 --> 00:04:57,785
This is why I shop online because then

161
00:04:57,785 --> 00:04:59,550
I can't be tempted by
everything in the store

162
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,470
and this cart's getting heavy to push.

163
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,008
Pineapples are only 99 cents.

164
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,876
That pretty much means we have to get one

165
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:07,688
and they look good.

166
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:11,538
- I felt like I needed
a treat after building

167
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:15,218
so we ate chips, salsa, watched a video.

168
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,536
- [Kendra] Whoa.

169
00:05:16,536 --> 00:05:18,101
Thanks, Lisey!

170
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:19,106
Thanks for helpin', bud.

171
00:05:19,106 --> 00:05:19,995
We missed you at the store.

172
00:05:19,995 --> 00:05:21,079
Did you have fun with Dad?

173
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,970
- Yep.

174
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,373
- So after I had Janae,
I lost a lot of hair.

175
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:25,550
That's kind of a normal thing that happens

176
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,775
after you have a baby
and then you're bald,

177
00:05:27,775 --> 00:05:29,137
which is kind of annoying
and then your hair

178
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:30,704
starts growing back and
it gets really annoying

179
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:33,725
because it's this perfect
length that it can't,

180
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:35,627
do you guys see this?

181
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,006
My hair right there is
too short to fit back

182
00:05:38,006 --> 00:05:40,950
into my bun and things but it's too long,

183
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,867
so it sticks out oddly.

184
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:45,508
This too shall pass.

185
00:05:45,508 --> 00:05:46,786
And it was still worth it for Janae.

186
00:05:46,786 --> 00:05:47,802
Thanks for helpin'.

187
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:48,635
- [Isaac] Yeah.

188
00:05:48,635 --> 00:05:49,683
- Thanks for buying us stuff.

189
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:50,772
- [Kendra] Thanks for payin' for it.

190
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:52,910
- Dad, how much do you think this is?

191
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:53,999
- [Jeremy] How much did it cost?

192
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:54,936
- Yep.

193
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:55,769
- [Jeremy] I don't know.

194
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:56,602
Caleb, you wanna give it a guess?

195
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:58,373
How much money did all this cost?

196
00:05:58,373 --> 00:06:00,373
- I'm guessing like 104.

197
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:03,678
- [Jeremy] 104 dollars.

198
00:06:03,678 --> 00:06:05,249
Alright, Laura has a guess.

199
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:06,726
- 80.40.

200
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:07,559
(Jeremy laughs)

201
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:09,298
- 8,040 bucks.

202
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:11,747
- I'm gonna guess 120 dollars.

203
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,307
- [Kendra] Dun, dun, dunnn.

204
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:14,281
- What is it?

205
00:06:14,281 --> 00:06:17,197
- The actual retail price is--

206
00:06:17,197 --> 00:06:18,837
- 198.

207
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,236
- [Jeremy] 198?

208
00:06:20,236 --> 00:06:21,069
- [Kendra] Yup.

209
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:22,798
- I was way off.
(sad trombone playing)

210
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:24,201
You spent all my money!

211
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,032
(he laughs)

212
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:26,865
- Alright.

213
00:06:26,865 --> 00:06:27,698
It's time to assemble dinner.

214
00:06:27,698 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm gonna make chicken
tortilla soup in the Crock-Pot.

215
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,033
It's one of my favorite
meals and it's pretty easy.

216
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,280
So we have two Crock-Pots.

217
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,733
So we're gonna make two batches.

218
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:36,550
(peaceful music)

219
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,692
So the boys have been
outside playing sports

220
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:42,859
and bird watching and they
just discovered this huge bird.

221
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:46,674
Oh, my goodness.

222
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,496
- [Caleb] Black Bird.

223
00:06:48,496 --> 00:06:49,693
- [Kendra] That thing is huge!

224
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:51,092
- [Isaac] We named him Black Bird.

225
00:06:51,092 --> 00:06:53,934
We were playing basketball
and I just saw that.

226
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:55,228
- [Kendra] I wonder what
kind of a bird it is?

227
00:06:55,228 --> 00:06:57,737
- [Isaac] I think it's, I
think it's a golden eagle.

228
00:06:57,737 --> 00:07:01,104
- [Kendra] It's kind of hard
to see with all the leaves.

229
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:01,985
- [Caleb] Yeah.

230
00:07:01,985 --> 00:07:03,352
It's camouflage.

231
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,294
- I'm guessing it's a golden eagle

232
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:07,971
but it could be a lot of other things.

233
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,592
Like a falcon?
- Mum, is it a giant?

234
00:07:09,592 --> 00:07:10,425
- [Kendra] It's not a giant.

235
00:07:10,425 --> 00:07:11,676
It's just a large bird.

236
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:15,165
So it's definitely a bird of prey.

237
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:15,998
Whoa!

238
00:07:15,998 --> 00:07:17,665
That is a huge nest!

239
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:19,719
(she gasps)

240
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:21,219
- [Isaac] Or hawk.

241
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:23,417
- Oh my goodness.

242
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:25,584
So this nest is ginormous.

243
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:28,351
Check that out!

244
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,386
I mean, so there's the tree.

245
00:07:30,386 --> 00:07:31,429
There's the nest.

246
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,392
That thing's huge.

247
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:35,436
Oh, this is a good view of the bird.

248
00:07:35,436 --> 00:07:38,586
(peaceful music)

249
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:40,565
- Just go up that bridge
and then there it is.

250
00:07:40,565 --> 00:07:41,717
- [Kendra] So what's your guess?

251
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:45,668
- I guess he's a hawk or a golden eagle.

252
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:47,188
- [Kendra] That would be amazing.

253
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:49,089
- I just hope that that's its nest

254
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:51,243
and he's gonna have like 20 kids.

255
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:52,076
- [Kendra] You think so?

256
00:07:52,076 --> 00:07:53,575
- Now I see him!

257
00:07:53,575 --> 00:07:54,784
- He's big.

258
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:55,922
I really like the fall.

259
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:57,385
It's pretty out here.

260
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:58,545
- [Kendra and Jeremy] There's a bubble.

261
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,378
(laughing)

262
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:00,769
- It's floating.
- The kids are very excited.

263
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,019
(giggling)

264
00:08:05,904 --> 00:08:07,944
- [Kid] Let's get the thing.

265
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:10,369
- [Jeremy] There's the bubble.

266
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:13,128
- [Kendra] Maybe it'll float forever.

267
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:15,326
Janae, you see the bubble?

268
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:16,691
Is it going up again?

269
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:17,774
- [Kid] Yeah!

270
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,053
- [Jeremy] It survived!

271
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:22,136
- This guy is a survivor.

272
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:27,851
- [Jeremy] The bubble popped.

273
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:29,383
It went to bubble heaven.

274
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,666
- Mm hm.

275
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:31,552
- So sad.

276
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,573
(Jeremy laughs)

277
00:08:32,573 --> 00:08:35,051
Mom, can you please wash your hands?

278
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:35,885
- [Kendra] I did.

279
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:37,253
- [Jeremy] In memory of Survivor.

280
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:38,934
- No, they want more bubbles.

281
00:08:38,934 --> 00:08:40,754
So the soup that I made for my neighbor

282
00:08:40,755 --> 00:08:41,980
and our soup, they're right here.

283
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,989
They're almost done cooking.

284
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:45,763
I just put the cornbread into the oven.

285
00:08:45,763 --> 00:08:47,082
This is our favorite kind of cornbread.

286
00:08:47,082 --> 00:08:47,915
- Uh huh.

287
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:51,080
It's like a cake but if
we put frosting on it,

288
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,857
then it'll taste more like a cake.

289
00:08:52,857 --> 00:08:53,718
- [Kendra] It's true.

290
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:54,711
But we'll just call it cornbread

291
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,761
so we can eat it with dinner.

292
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,660
Sometimes the hardest part
of taking dinner to somebody

293
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,019
is trying to figure out
how to get it over there

294
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,193
without spilling it.

295
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:03,869
Transporting dinner can be a challenge.

296
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:05,276
What are you doing?

297
00:09:05,276 --> 00:09:07,679
Your little face looks so innocent

298
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,407
but look at the mess that you have made!

299
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:11,592
So I know that for about the next year

300
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,182
my house and my floor is going to

301
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,075
perpetually look like this.

302
00:09:15,075 --> 00:09:16,605
There's going to be stuff everywhere

303
00:09:16,605 --> 00:09:20,251
and it's because that is how
this age learns and discovers.

304
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,197
They have to take everything
out and look at it

305
00:09:22,197 --> 00:09:23,439
and turn it around and touch it

306
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:26,422
and put it in their
mouths and that's okay.

307
00:09:26,422 --> 00:09:27,788
Mess just goes along with the territory.

308
00:09:27,788 --> 00:09:29,550
I'm glad that she's
learning and exploring.

309
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,043
I love her little curious mind.

310
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:32,876
- [Little Kid Voiceover] Good night.

311
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:34,544
J House out.

312
00:09:34,544 --> 00:09:36,571
(energetic music)

313
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,998
- My name is Queen Esile.

314
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:42,809
- All of my dating Mom is in this journal.

315
00:09:42,809 --> 00:09:43,686
- [Jeremy] This is the recommended way

316
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,139
to dry your nails, right?

317
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:47,246
- So she's graduating to this toy.

318
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:48,132
(energetic music)

319
00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:50,437
- [Jeremy] So you're writing
about your Disneyland trip?

320
00:09:50,437 --> 00:00:00,000
(energetic music)
