1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:05,680
- [Jeremy] Oh! (laughs)

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,876
So since the kids saw that
there were rattlesnakes here.

3
00:00:07,876 --> 00:00:09,620
- [Kendra] They've been a little nervous.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,677
You got it, girl!

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,925
(gasps) Woo!

6
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,592
Oh my goodness!

7
00:00:13,592 --> 00:00:15,478
The best way to pass the
time and keep everyone sane

8
00:00:15,478 --> 00:00:17,010
is to sing.

9
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,370
(baby vocalizes)

10
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,770
- I'm just feeding Nae Nae.

11
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,720
- [Jeremy] Yay!

12
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,500
Thanks for making your bed.

13
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,080
Thanks for doing the dishes, buddy.

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,962
So what'd you write this morning
in your gratitude journal?

15
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:49,222
- Things that keeps me safe in my room.

16
00:00:49,222 --> 00:00:50,200
- [Jeremy] Like what?

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,543
- Door, bed, blanket, fan.

18
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:53,580
- Hi.

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,053
- [Jeremy] Hi, well good morning.

20
00:00:56,053 --> 00:00:58,419
So have you seen how there's
fog all down in the valley?

21
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,860
Hopefully it clears out as the day goes on

22
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,028
and we can have a clear day.

23
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:02,903
- Yeah.

24
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:03,736
- Hi, Da.

25
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:04,569
- [Jeremy] Hi, Dad.

26
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,402
- Hi, Da.

27
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:06,610
- [Jeremy] Hi, Dad.

28
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:09,110
(light music)

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,470
- So while we're here in San Diego,

30
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,540
we're still needing things,
you know, normal things,

31
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,747
like paper towels and toilet
paper and dishwasher detergent,

32
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,442
and also fun things like
sand toys and beach balls.

33
00:01:25,442 --> 00:01:27,450
And we don't want to
spend a bunch of our time

34
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,357
running around shopping, because we want

35
00:01:28,357 --> 00:01:31,170
to spend our time playing
and enjoying family time.

36
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,966
So we were really excited
when Google Express

37
00:01:32,966 --> 00:01:35,290
reached out to sponsor our video today.

38
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,484
Through Google Express, you
can shop multiple stores

39
00:01:37,484 --> 00:01:39,278
with one easy checkout, and you can use it

40
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,790
on your desktop, mobile, or the app.

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,820
Let's get some stuff.

42
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,125
So one thing I've learned
is if you're going

43
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:45,491
to the beach a lot, you
do a lot of laundry.

44
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:48,292
Laundry detergent.

45
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,893
I'm also out of this makeup.

46
00:01:49,893 --> 00:01:51,840
Mmm, popped right up.

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,300
So when you find the
product that you like,

48
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,390
when you come back the next time,

49
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,640
it's really easy to reorder.

50
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,088
So which sand toys are you interested in?

51
00:01:57,088 --> 00:01:58,320
- That one.

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,207
- Hey, Laura.

53
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:00,040
- Hey.

54
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,873
- Do you wanna help us shop?

55
00:02:00,873 --> 00:02:01,706
- Yeah.

56
00:02:01,706 --> 00:02:03,194
- We're looking at these,
do you know what these are?

57
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:04,460
- Kites.

58
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,170
- So which one do you want
to play on the beach, Laura?

59
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,014
- [Laura] This one.

60
00:02:08,014 --> 00:02:09,030
- [Kendra] You like that one?

61
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:10,990
- I like that one, I
think it's the best one.

62
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:11,823
- Me too.

63
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,380
- You like this one, we agree on it?

64
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,493
- Yep, yep, done.
- Done.

65
00:02:14,493 --> 00:02:15,612
We got a kite.

66
00:02:15,612 --> 00:02:19,252
I don't know if you're helping
me shop or distracting me.

67
00:02:19,252 --> 00:02:20,183
(Laura giggles)

68
00:02:20,183 --> 00:02:21,503
All right, Laura, which
trash bags should we get?

69
00:02:21,503 --> 00:02:22,376
Trash bags.

70
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,683
So that's from Target.

71
00:02:23,683 --> 00:02:25,713
So there's free delivery
and no membership,

72
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,650
you just have to meet
the minimum requirement

73
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,690
for each store, which we did.

74
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,630
Oh, paper towels!

75
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,401
Done. All right.
- In the cart!

76
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,280
- In the cart, yep didee yep!

77
00:02:36,904 --> 00:02:38,362
(both laugh)

78
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:40,270
- Thank you so much to Google Express

79
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,423

80
00:02:41,423 --> 00:02:43,503
and we have a coupon code!

81
00:02:43,503 --> 00:02:46,160
Coupon code, coupon code,

83
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:51,210
Go use it, it's in our
description box below.

84
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,470
So we came out to a new park today,

85
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,867
and it's called San Dieguito County Park.

86
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:00,087
- I think this one is the stage.

87
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:01,139
- [Jeremy] Did you find a stage?

88
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,379
- [Caleb] Do you want a water, Daddy?

89
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,379
Here, water.

90
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,424
- [Jeremy] You're performing on the stage?

91
00:03:08,424 --> 00:03:09,924
- I'm tap dancing.

92
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,341
- And we're right here, so
we're gonna go this way.

93
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:18,490
You guys ready?

94
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,270
- [Jeremy] Whoa!

95
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,220
- [Kendra] Check it out, we
made it to the hawk's nest.

96
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,617
- [Jeremy] We should've
brought our binoculars.

97
00:03:29,617 --> 00:03:30,450
- Yeah.

98
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,386
'Kay, so there's also
quail here, and rabbits.

99
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,847
This is gonna show us
what a red-shouldered hawk

100
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:37,992
sounds like.

101
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:40,345
- [Speaker] The red-shouldered hawk.

102
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,300
(hawk screeches)

103
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,270
- [Jeremy] So since the kids thought

104
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,990
that there were rattlesnakes here.

105
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,916
- [Kendra] They've been a little nervous.

106
00:03:46,916 --> 00:03:48,675
- [Jeremy] They've been a
little concerned about it.

107
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:50,907
- [Kendra] Southern Pacific rattlesnake.

108
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:53,333
(rattler rattles)

109
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,546
- [Jeremy] Hear that noise?

110
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:57,346
- [Kendra] That's what a
rattlesnake sounds like.

111
00:03:57,346 --> 00:03:59,116
- That's a good thing to know.

112
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:00,040
- [Jeremy] Yeah.
- [Kendra] It is.

113
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,210
- [Woman Over Speaker]
The most important thing

114
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,564
to do is call 911.

115
00:04:03,564 --> 00:04:05,676
- So there's these
activities all along the way

116
00:04:05,676 --> 00:04:07,766
the kids are trying, it's funny.

117
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,628
And by kids, I mean Jeremy.

118
00:04:09,628 --> 00:04:11,924
They're a bunch of monkeys.

119
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:14,007
(laughs)

120
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,726
One, two, three.

121
00:04:17,726 --> 00:04:21,796
- [Jeremy] She's so cute when
everyone's smiling at her.

122
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,214
(rock music)

123
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,040
- [Child] Lizard!

124
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,602
- [Jeremy] 'Kay, try to catch it.

125
00:04:36,602 --> 00:04:37,524
Get it, Leesee.

126
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:40,121
- [Kendra] Leesee, you're so brave.

127
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,340
- [Jeremy] Oh! (laughs)

128
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,439
- [Kendra] Good try!

129
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:44,272
- [Jeremy] What did you hear, Laura?

130
00:04:44,272 --> 00:04:46,150
- I heard a woodpecker!

131
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,647
- [Kendra] Let's go this
way, is that another lookout?

132
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,490
- [Jeremy] It's another lookout.

133
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,664
- 'Kay, so look, this is
a Lemonade Berry bush.

134
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:57,414
(pleasant music)

135
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,917
There they are, wave!

136
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,005
- It's actually kinda hard.

137
00:05:17,005 --> 00:05:19,183
(Jeremy laughs)

138
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:20,341
(Elise grunts)

139
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:21,855
- [Kendra] Good, put your arms up there.

140
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,629
Put your arms up, ready?

141
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:24,975
And pull!

142
00:05:24,975 --> 00:05:26,328
- No.

143
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,240
- No? (laughs)

144
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,560
- [Elise] I think my gymnastics teacher

145
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,797
would be so happy for me.

146
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,241
- [Kendra] Ready? There we go!

147
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,329
Go!

148
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:34,011
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae's helpin' ya.

149
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:34,844
(Elise laughs)

150
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:37,720
- Well, we successfully made it back out.

151
00:05:43,191 --> 00:05:45,349
- (laughs) I laid on my belly.

152
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:47,349
- [Jeremy] Yeah you did.

153
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,343
- This is like American Ninja Warrior.

154
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:52,293
- [Jeremy] Reminds me of your birthday.

155
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,713
- One, two, three, go!

156
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:02,032
She's like what was that?

157
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:04,410
Janae did not want to be held.

158
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,720
Janae wants to swing.

159
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,735
Da-da.

160
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:10,195
You remember how to
pump, don't you, Laura?

161
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,140
Move your legs like Leesee.

162
00:06:16,619 --> 00:06:18,470
- [Jeremy] You guys making a restaurant?

163
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,980
- Laura, grab more leaves, okay?

164
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,166
What is this called, Laura?

165
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,450
- Barf.

166
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,307
- [Jeremy] What is it called?

167
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:24,140
- Barf.

168
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:26,355
- [Jeremy] You want me to eat your barf?

169
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:28,221
- No, just for pretend.

170
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,458
- [Jeremy] Just for pretend.

171
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,170
- It's called bark.

172
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,560
- [Jeremy] Bark? Not barf?

173
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,024
- Barf is when you're mad.

174
00:06:34,024 --> 00:06:36,670
- [Elise] No, I think it's gross.

175
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:39,710
- [Kendra] These things are cool.

176
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,390
- [Jeremy] Getting your workout in?

177
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,910
Mom wants to try.

178
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,907
- Should I crank up that resistance?

179
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:46,958
- [Jeremy] Go all the way.

180
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,147
- I'm scared!

181
00:06:48,147 --> 00:06:49,850
Oh, that's a good workout.

182
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,819
- [Jeremy] Practicing your basketball?

183
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,130
- [Kendra] Is Dad trying
to steal the ball?

184
00:07:04,106 --> 00:07:06,523
(rock music)

185
00:07:13,265 --> 00:07:15,170
- [Jeremy] Come get stuck with Mom.

186
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,702
- Kids make this look so easy.

187
00:07:16,702 --> 00:07:17,992
I can't get up.

188
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:20,189
(Jeremy laughs)

189
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,836
Momma needs to work out more.

190
00:07:22,836 --> 00:07:24,851
- [Jeremy] End it with the gymnastics.

191
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:25,693
Boom.

192
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:27,410
- Check out these roots!

193
00:07:30,672 --> 00:07:32,746
These two just invented a game.

194
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:35,660
You give them a ball, and each other,

195
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,880
and they're just busy playing games.

196
00:07:40,872 --> 00:07:42,947
This girl's cheering, she's excited.

197
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,766
- [Janae] Da da da da.

198
00:07:44,766 --> 00:07:46,465
- [Child] She's going for Dada.

199
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:48,354
- [Jeremy] 'Kay, Laura's turn.

200
00:07:48,354 --> 00:07:50,196
- [Caleb] Laura, do the whole thing.

201
00:07:50,196 --> 00:07:51,800
- I'm gonna shake out right now.

202
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,982
- [Jeremy] Shake out those hands.

203
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:55,510
- They're really sore. (gabbles)

204
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,710
- [Jeremy] Shake it off.

205
00:07:58,216 --> 00:07:59,805
Laura, who's your teacher?

206
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:01,100
- Caleb.

207
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,481
- [Jeremy] Yeah, he's your teacher.

208
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:04,527
- Really good teacher. (laughs)

209
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,920
Ow!
- [Jeremy] Oh, ow!

210
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,650
(all laugh)

211
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,900
Bonked her with your bum!

212
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:15,858
- [Kendra] Look at him go!

213
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:18,030
- [Jeremy] 'Kay, Laura, let's see it.

214
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,302
- [Caleb] So hang, put
your first hand there,

215
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:21,740
other hand, other hand.
- [Kendra] Good job.

216
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,791
You got it, girl!

217
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,458
Woo! Oh my goodness!

218
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:28,510
Oh my goodness!

219
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,274
Laura you got it, you got it!

220
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:31,524
- [Caleb] Get it.

221
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,643
- [Kendra] Good job, Caleb.

222
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:34,476
- [Caleb] 'Kay, your other hand.

223
00:08:34,476 --> 00:08:35,476
- [All] Yay!

224
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,909
- [Isaac] Good job, you did it!

225
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,289
- [Jeremy] That was incredible!

226
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,631
- [Kendra] Laura, you did it!

227
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:44,267
I have never seen a
three-year-old do monkey bars.

228
00:08:44,268 --> 00:08:46,601
- I know, it's really hard.

229
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:52,681
- So we're trying a new
burger place for dinner.

230
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:59,087
Looks like we tired out at
least one of our children.

231
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,745
But not the other ones.

232
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:03,220
- No, you got us more energy.

233
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,357
- [Kendra] We got you more energy?

234
00:09:04,357 --> 00:09:05,960
- Yes, yeah.

235
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:09,013
- [Jeremy] That looks good.

236
00:09:09,013 --> 00:09:11,779
- So this place does chicken on a stick.

237
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:14,362
(upbeat music)

238
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,040
So this salad looks really good.

239
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,640
Jeremy and I are splitting
the burger and the salad.

240
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:29,932
Little tip, when you're
stuck in traffic with kids

241
00:09:29,932 --> 00:09:31,865
at night, the best way to pass the time

242
00:09:31,865 --> 00:09:34,490
and keep everyone sane is to sing.

243
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,323
Sing it loud.

244
00:09:35,323 --> 00:09:39,375
♪ Open your eyes, let's
begin (Kendra laughs) ♪

245
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,802
♪ Yes it's really me, it's Maui ♪

246
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:44,290
Goodnight. J House out.

247
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,500
When you eat this cake
tomorrow, you're gonna be

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,370
eight years old.

249
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,869
- Welcome to our hotel.

250
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,397
- It's so good to see you.

251
00:09:51,397 --> 00:09:53,980
(upbeat music)

252
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,603
- And a seagull flew by and
took the whole granola bar

253
00:09:59,603 --> 00:00:00,000
out of her hands.
