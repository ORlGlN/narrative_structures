1
00:00:00,113 --> 00:00:03,252
- Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

2
00:00:03,252 --> 00:00:07,335
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

3
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:10,333
- [Jeremy] Alright you guys, how did it go

4
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:11,506
sleeping in the tent?

5
00:00:11,506 --> 00:00:12,643
- Went pretty well.

6
00:00:12,643 --> 00:00:14,143
- It was very fun.

7
00:00:15,236 --> 00:00:18,619
- It was a little bit scary
because I had a bad dream.

8
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,786
(group conversation)

9
00:00:32,764 --> 00:00:34,827
- You guys, let the air out.

10
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:37,053
- All the air out.

11
00:00:37,053 --> 00:00:39,105
- Alright, I'm laying on it,

12
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,753
I'm walking on it.

13
00:00:40,753 --> 00:00:43,586
(uplifting music)

14
00:01:06,296 --> 00:01:08,125
(laughter)

15
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:09,708
Thanks for helping.

16
00:01:14,059 --> 00:01:15,492
(laughing)

17
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,325
Dancing (laughs).

18
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:23,234
(upbeat music and laughter)

19
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:36,602
So I don't know if you guys remember

20
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:40,308
when Caleb flooded the
toilet and caused a leak,

21
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,043
and then we had this hole in our ceiling.

22
00:01:43,043 --> 00:01:45,537
We have a friend from
church who's a builder,

23
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:47,877
Chris, he's out here giving us a quote

24
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:49,712
'cause we're gonna try
to mix some things up.

25
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,454
- We think we should fix it.

26
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:53,950
And we're also thinking about
putting a wall up down here

27
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,707
and creating an office space.

28
00:01:55,707 --> 00:01:57,213
- [Jeremy] Like a fourth bedroom.

29
00:01:57,213 --> 00:01:58,582
- Yeah, it would be a fourth bedroom,

30
00:01:58,582 --> 00:02:01,143
but right now we would
use it as an office space.

31
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,167
So we're just looking into that.

32
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,368
It'd be sad to break up the nice big room,

33
00:02:05,368 --> 00:02:06,488
but I think there'd still be enough room

34
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:07,557
for the kids to play.

35
00:02:07,557 --> 00:02:09,753
- Yeah, big decisions.

36
00:02:09,753 --> 00:02:13,283
- Look, look at that clean bathroom.

37
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:14,116
Ah!

38
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,262
So it's officially spring,

39
00:02:16,262 --> 00:02:18,462
oh my goodness, I hear an ice cream truck.

40
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:20,492
That's cute, anyway,

41
00:02:20,492 --> 00:02:22,501
it's just funny, like we had
snow flurries this weekend

42
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,594
and it was freezing,

43
00:02:23,594 --> 00:02:25,331
and now we're out in our short sleeves

44
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:26,501
enjoying the sunshine,

45
00:02:26,501 --> 00:02:27,984
and I think the kids are
gonna be outside playing

46
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:29,008
all day long.

47
00:02:29,008 --> 00:02:30,278
We have friends over now,

48
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:31,598
more friends coming this afternoon,

49
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:33,497
we're gonna be with our cousins tonight,

50
00:02:33,497 --> 00:02:36,330
so we're just enjoying the spring.

51
00:02:37,354 --> 00:02:39,473
- So our cousins are really
big into Harry Potter,

52
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:40,900
and that's what they're playing right now.

53
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,600
- Wingardium leviosa!

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,933
Wingardium leviosa, leviosa.

55
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:48,497
- What is it again?

56
00:02:48,497 --> 00:02:50,696
- Wingardium leviosa.

57
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,130
- Wingardium leviosa, pshoo.

58
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,014
- [Jeremy] Oh, what happened to me?

59
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:56,037
- [Boy] You float.

60
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:56,974
- [Jeremy] I float?

61
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:58,453
Okay, tell him another one.

62
00:02:58,453 --> 00:02:59,467
- Expelliarmus.

63
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,199
- Expelliarmus, yeah, (mumbles).

64
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,703
- Expelliarmus, pshoo.

65
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:03,789
- [Jeremy] Ah!

66
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:04,781
- Ha ha.

67
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,372
- We're gonna go get Malfoy now.

68
00:03:06,372 --> 00:03:07,378
- [Jeremy] Okay.

69
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:09,878
(piano music)

70
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:13,475
So Allison got her hair cut,

71
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,550
I love it.

72
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,765
- Kitty, kitty, come here, come here.

73
00:03:16,765 --> 00:03:18,169
- [Jeremy] Is there a kitty?

74
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,252
- Meow, meow.

75
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,076
Come here, kitty.

76
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:24,146
- [Jeremy] Is that a kitty?

77
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,877
Do you see the doggie?

78
00:03:25,877 --> 00:03:27,469
- Hi, doggie.

79
00:03:27,469 --> 00:03:29,219
Woof woof, woof woof.

80
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,248
- [Kendra] So Brett and
Michelle are babysitting

81
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:33,135
a dog right now who's name is Dexter,

82
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:35,754
and he's a cute little, I think maltipoo?

83
00:03:35,754 --> 00:03:36,746
Is that what he's called?

84
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:37,731
- (laughs) I hope so.

85
00:03:37,731 --> 00:03:39,463
- Michelle, is he a maltipoo?

86
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,605
- [Michelle] I think he's
maltese, or a maltipoo.

87
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:43,254
- It's a maltese, or a maltipoo.

88
00:03:43,254 --> 00:03:44,995
- There's a dog called a
maltipoo, that's awesome.

89
00:03:44,995 --> 00:03:48,407
- And I love it, I love the
little tiny white fluffy dogs,

90
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:49,882
and I'm sorry, my nose itches.

91
00:03:49,882 --> 00:03:50,997
(laughter)

92
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,001
- It's a vlogging thing,

93
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,248
when she starts to talk to the camera,

94
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,970
her nose itches, you're
allergic to the camera.

95
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,748
- (laughs) Oh, anyway,

96
00:03:57,748 --> 00:03:59,376
so I just love him,

97
00:03:59,376 --> 00:04:00,560
like he's just so cute,

98
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,154
and the size is small enough

99
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:04,162
that the kids aren't
as intimidated by him.

100
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:08,329
(upbeat music and background conversation)

101
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,733
Say, "There you go, Dexter."

102
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,500
- So if you have a dog,
let us know in the comments

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,755
what kind of dog do you have.

104
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:22,471
- (mumbles) What is the word?

105
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,090
- Obliviate?

106
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,532
Yeah, yeah.

107
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:28,295
- Obliviate! (mouth explosion)

108
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:31,328
- He's a natural born wizard right there.

109
00:04:31,328 --> 00:04:34,513
- Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

110
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:38,497
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

111
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:41,109
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

112
00:04:41,109 --> 00:04:42,973
- [Jeremy] Oh, you got him.

113
00:04:42,973 --> 00:04:44,683
You turned him into a monkey.

114
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:46,237
You said it a little bit wrong.

115
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:47,280
(laughter)

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,085
- Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

117
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,223
Avada kedavra! (mouth explosion)

118
00:04:51,223 --> 00:04:55,530
♫ Who sent his son to walk with men

119
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,030
♫ On earth so we may know

120
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,082
- [Jeremy] So with Easter coming up,

121
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:04,539
we are dyeing Easter eggs today.

122
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:05,641
- So last year at our house,

123
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:08,714
we accidentally dyed a
whole carton of raw eggs.

124
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:09,760
- [Jeremy] It was awesome.

125
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,608
- It made for some interesting times.

126
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:15,627
So I saw somewhere the idea
to put rubber bands on it,

127
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:16,927
so it'll make some white stripes,

128
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,342
we're gonna see if it works out.

129
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,665
What are you doing with yours, Lisey?

130
00:05:20,665 --> 00:05:22,076
- Doing both sides.

131
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:24,493
- Doing two different colors.

132
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:28,703
Do you wanna eat one, Laura?

133
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,799
- [Michelle] Pink with blue stripes.

134
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:33,492
- She doesn't really understand
what we're doing yet.

135
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:37,409
- Mine's the slowest, I
have to wait very long.

136
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:40,337
Look, it's not even dark.

137
00:05:40,337 --> 00:05:43,670
- Alright, Laura picked green this time.

138
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,471
(laughter)

139
00:05:47,471 --> 00:05:49,804
- Ew, that's vinegar, gross.

140
00:05:51,921 --> 00:05:53,088
Is that yummy?

141
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,403
- Yucky.

142
00:05:56,753 --> 00:05:58,872
- [Michelle] It's pretty
though, I like that color.

143
00:05:58,872 --> 00:06:00,445
- Alright, let's take these off.

144
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:05,375
(children talking at the same time)

145
00:06:05,375 --> 00:06:08,214
Glad I'm not wearing a white shirt.

146
00:06:08,214 --> 00:06:09,352
- [Jeremy] Did it work?

147
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:10,484
- It did work.

148
00:06:10,484 --> 00:06:11,755
- [Jeremy] That's cool.

149
00:06:11,755 --> 00:06:12,995
- [Michelle] That is an evil egg.

150
00:06:12,995 --> 00:06:16,103
- [Kendra] Caleb, yours
is a little bit sparkly.

151
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:17,543
- [Jeremy] Now you're all sparkly.

152
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,962
- [Michelle] Here, throw this
in the red for just a minute.

153
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,279
- [Jeremy] Okay, let's set it down.

154
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,862
(upbeat music)

155
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,307
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

156
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:36,988
- [Kendra] This may be
the cutest little thing.

157
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:39,042
Stop acting like a pest, says Beezus,

158
00:06:39,042 --> 00:00:00,000
who's real name is Beatrice.
