1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:03,043
- We are headed to the
thrift store tonight.

2
00:00:03,043 --> 00:00:05,733
Isaac, we just dropped him
off at community choir,

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,260
and so we have an hour to kill.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,541
- So I've been invited to some

5
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:11,975
ugly Christmas sweater parties.

6
00:00:11,975 --> 00:00:14,359
And so I was hoping to find some goodies.

7
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:16,942
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:22,890
Come on.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,640
- Some of this stuff.

10
00:00:26,236 --> 00:00:27,981
- Gotta find the diamonds in the rough.

11
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,698
- [Girl] Oh, I want these kind of gloves.

12
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,534
- Sweetie, those are socks.

13
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:34,590
- So it's been way too long
since I've done a thrift store.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,044
Growing up, this was like the only place

15
00:00:36,044 --> 00:00:37,226
my mom would bring us

16
00:00:37,226 --> 00:00:39,143
up until I was like 16.

17
00:00:40,756 --> 00:00:42,957
So I always kinda despised it, but

18
00:00:42,957 --> 00:00:43,957
this is fun.

19
00:00:44,995 --> 00:00:47,420
I'm super excited about it.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,495
- A one, a two, a one, two, three, go.

21
00:00:50,495 --> 00:00:53,078
(upbeat music)

22
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:10,451
- This is my favorite section.

23
00:01:10,451 --> 00:01:12,284
It's the book section.

24
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:18,529
- That looks weird.

25
00:01:18,529 --> 00:01:20,367
That looks like Bert.

26
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:21,535
- [Jeremy] Bert from Mary Poppins?

27
00:01:21,535 --> 00:01:23,333
- Uh-huh, you have to wear it.

28
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,366
It looks good.

29
00:01:24,366 --> 00:01:26,533
(Singing)

30
00:01:27,374 --> 00:01:31,541
- Kendra just gave me the
very embarrassed wife look.

31
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:34,601
- You're gonna get more of the

32
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,390
very embarrassed wife look, too.

33
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,306
All right, here's the short list of books.

34
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:41,045
Now I'm probably gonna
actually go home with like one,

35
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:41,878
because I have a buying problem.

36
00:01:41,878 --> 00:01:42,711
- If any.

37
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:45,430
Kendra will have everything
in the cart ready to go,

38
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,582
and then we get up to the cash register,

39
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,705
and she'll just decide
not to get anything.

40
00:01:49,705 --> 00:01:50,618
That's a common occurrence.

41
00:01:50,618 --> 00:01:51,918
- I'm not a great shopper.

42
00:01:51,918 --> 00:01:53,170
But let's go see if
there's some pants for you.

43
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,639
- [Jeremy] Wait, what books did you get?

44
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,472
- Let's see.

45
00:01:56,472 --> 00:01:57,921
- [Jeremy] Which ones are
you most excited about?

46
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,882
- We've got Across Five Aprils,

47
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:03,058
Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of Nimh,

48
00:02:03,058 --> 00:02:05,111
A Long Way from Chicago, Johnny Tremain,

49
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,785
Hello, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle,
Anne of Green Gables

50
00:02:06,785 --> 00:02:09,287
and The Best Christmas Pageant Ever.

51
00:02:09,287 --> 00:02:11,249
- Ooh, Anne of Green Gables.

52
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:12,926
Which one are you most excited about?

53
00:02:12,926 --> 00:02:14,867
- Probably The Best Christmas Pageant Ever

54
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:17,876
because it's a classic and it's
Christmastime right now, so.

55
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:19,187
- [Jeremy] Nice.

56
00:02:19,187 --> 00:02:20,085
- Bonus.

57
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:21,002
- Yes, yes.

58
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,218
Wait, there's like a whole section

59
00:02:23,218 --> 00:02:25,820
of ugly Christmas sweaters.

60
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,242
Oh, they're all female ones.

61
00:02:27,242 --> 00:02:29,478
Maybe that's even better.

62
00:02:29,478 --> 00:02:30,311
Better.

63
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:31,582
Okay, I'm gonna look.

64
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:32,418
Thank you.

65
00:02:32,418 --> 00:02:34,614
We found the ugly
Christmas sweater section.

66
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:37,028
It's in the girls' section.

67
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:39,611
(upbeat music)

68
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:14,924
What are you thinking, ladies?

69
00:03:14,924 --> 00:03:15,867
- It's pretty.

70
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:16,972
- So he just ran into the dressing room

71
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:19,472
with a whole bunch of jewelry.

72
00:03:21,544 --> 00:03:24,639
Oh, are you so proud of yourself?

73
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,898
Let's show it to me.

74
00:03:26,898 --> 00:03:28,130
That looks so nice.

75
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,839
Okay, can you show me where it goes back?

76
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:31,064
Show me where it goes.

77
00:03:31,064 --> 00:03:33,503
Show me what a big boy you
are that you can put it back.

78
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:36,560
- I don't want to take it back.

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,727
(yelling)

80
00:03:43,885 --> 00:03:46,942
- Okay, you're gonna have to
take her so I can take Caelb.

81
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,004
So as we were getting ready to leave,

82
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:49,793
Caleb threw a massive tantrum.

83
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:52,447
And it ended up, like I
tried to talk him down,

84
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:55,292
I tried to like listen to him.

85
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:56,693
And eventually I just picked him up

86
00:03:56,693 --> 00:03:58,702
and walked out of the store, so.

87
00:03:58,702 --> 00:04:00,784
Classic, where you going, Jeremy?

88
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:02,142
- Yeah.

89
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,391
- [Kendra] Did you wanna stay?

90
00:04:03,391 --> 00:04:04,278
- Yeah.

91
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,962
Ready to do it.

92
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:09,085
- Is he crying most about
the necklaces that he wanted?

93
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,793
Why didn't we just buy him the necklaces?

94
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:12,000
He looked so cute in them.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,312
- Because that's what we do.

96
00:04:13,312 --> 00:04:15,735
We buy our children
whatever is upsetting them.

97
00:04:15,735 --> 00:04:19,189
- No, instead, the entire
store is like looking at us

98
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:20,856
as our baby screams.

99
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:23,474
- [Kendra] Who you talking to?

100
00:04:23,474 --> 00:04:25,011
- It's Sam on Samica.

101
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,983
I finally got in.

102
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:28,804
To a live chat.

103
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:30,643
- Hi, Samica.

104
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:32,225
- So it's so fun, I've
like asked questions

105
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:35,218
and they're responding
and there's interaction.

106
00:04:35,218 --> 00:04:36,458
- While he's doing that,
I wanted to show you

107
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:38,323
what we ended up with
from the thrift store.

108
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:39,995
So in total we spent $15.

109
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:41,791
We got two pairs of pants for Elise,

110
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:44,274
one shirt for Elise, a sweater for Jeremy,

111
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,626
a hat for Jeremy and a book.

112
00:04:46,626 --> 00:04:49,305
So that was our night at the thrift store.

113
00:04:49,305 --> 00:04:52,436
- Today is our two-month vlogiversarry.

114
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:54,051
Can you believe it?

115
00:04:54,051 --> 00:04:55,737
Two months.

116
00:04:55,737 --> 00:05:00,110
Yeah, September 18th, 2014,
was our first post on this.

117
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,943
Hey.

118
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:04,628
(laughter)

119
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:06,305
So it's been a crazy two months.

120
00:05:06,305 --> 00:05:08,041
We're so glad you came along for the ride.

121
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,975
We've had a steep learning curve.

122
00:05:09,975 --> 00:05:11,490
If you haven't already, we
would love for you to subscribe

123
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:15,350
and leave comments and be a
part of your YouTube family.

124
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,265
We've loved this adventure,

125
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:19,660
and we're excited about
some of the fun stuff

126
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,250
coming up in Month Three.

127
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,393
We've got Christmas and Thanksgiving

128
00:05:23,393 --> 00:05:25,154
and the holidays,

129
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:28,115
and we're just having a lot of fun.

130
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:29,429
Okay.

131
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,429
J House out.

132
00:05:31,636 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
