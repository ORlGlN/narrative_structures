1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:02,628
- So in Arizona apparently
they rake rocks.

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,195
And where I come from we rake leaves.

3
00:00:04,195 --> 00:00:07,209
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:08,604
Well Papa is home from the hospital

5
00:00:08,604 --> 00:00:09,984
and he's all showered up and looking

6
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,648
like himself again, you playing with papa?

7
00:00:13,648 --> 00:00:14,533
(girls laughing)

8
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:16,117
- [Dad] (mumbles) for bed.

9
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:18,701
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:31,662
What are you grateful for?

11
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:33,745
- I'm grateful for, Papa.

12
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:37,152
- [Dad] That's a good one.

13
00:00:37,152 --> 00:00:38,928
- I'm grateful for that Papa,

14
00:00:38,928 --> 00:00:42,428
is safe and that he's out of the hospital.

15
00:00:45,023 --> 00:00:47,356
- I'm grateful for Janaenae.

16
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:52,913
- I'm grateful for family and that

17
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:55,709
we can get to be together, you know,

18
00:00:55,709 --> 00:00:59,115
that we can have close
relationships with them.

19
00:00:59,115 --> 00:01:00,452
- I'm so grateful for all of you

20
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:02,687
who have donated to our upcoming

21
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:05,440
service celebration and
that means so much to us.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,660
We have the goal of raising $18,000.

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,272
For all these (mumbles) kids.

24
00:01:10,272 --> 00:01:12,142
And we just so appreciate all of you

25
00:01:12,142 --> 00:01:14,892
who are participating, thank you.

26
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,877
- [Mom] Good morning, Jenae
and I have been playing

27
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:24,898
peek-a-boo in my bed this
morning, who's there?

28
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:27,828
(Baby coos)

29
00:01:27,828 --> 00:01:29,209
- So because of the time change

30
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:30,524
between where we live in Kansas City

31
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:34,336
and here in Arizona Jenae's
been waking up early.

32
00:01:34,336 --> 00:01:35,555
So she and I get to spend the first

33
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:40,467
hour or so of the day,
just hanging out together.

34
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,881
Yeah, so it's fun to see her playing

35
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,798
with toys I played with growing up.

36
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,848
She's been learning how to
clap since we've been here.

37
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:52,766
I haven't been able to catch
it on camera yet though.

38
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:56,956
Okay, definitely got to lick all the toys.

39
00:01:56,956 --> 00:02:01,544
Check them out, I can tell
she misses the kids a lot.

40
00:02:01,544 --> 00:02:02,877
We headed out on a walk?

41
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,039
Well my dad's home from the hospital

42
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,551
and he is healing up
and doing really well.

43
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:09,445
He's adjusting to his medications

44
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:12,180
and still resting a
lot, he's really tired.

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,465
And there's still a lot of
unknowns about what's ahead.

46
00:02:14,465 --> 00:02:15,827
We found out that there's some

47
00:02:15,827 --> 00:02:17,865
more blockages in his heart that

48
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:18,899
we're gonna have to deal with.

49
00:02:18,899 --> 00:02:21,685
With further surgeries
and the recovery period.

50
00:02:21,685 --> 00:02:24,381
And risks that are ahead so, there's

51
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,732
still a lot of unknowns and so

52
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:28,547
I think we're all dealing
with that emotionally.

53
00:02:28,547 --> 00:02:32,070
But physically he's
recovering really well.

54
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,356
Oh you clapping your hands?

55
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:35,506
It's funny how different it is

56
00:02:35,506 --> 00:02:37,879
to go on a walk in different
parts of the country.

57
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,999
Here I'm seeing cactuses and palm trees

58
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,235
and at home, that's not
so much what we see.

59
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:44,818
(upbeat music)

60
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:50,308
So I hear from Jeremy that it's

61
00:02:50,308 --> 00:02:52,029
pretty cold in Kansas City right now.

62
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,321
But it is not cold here, it is gorgeous.

63
00:02:54,321 --> 00:02:55,988
You blowing bubbles?

64
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:02,052
(fast music)

65
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:16,487
- So the kids really like this restaurant

66
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,522
they have trains that
actually deliver the food.

67
00:03:19,522 --> 00:03:20,722
- Can we eat in the train?

68
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:22,469
- [Dad] Come sit down you guys.

69
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,370
So this place is cool, when you order,

70
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,511
you actually order on the phone.

71
00:03:26,511 --> 00:03:30,094
You call and make an
order, there it comes.

72
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:36,971
You got it.

73
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,086
Whoa, it's our food.

74
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:53,849
- Yeah we have a ton of fries.

75
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:57,711
- So I got a cheeseburger
that has hash browns on it.

76
00:03:57,711 --> 00:04:00,461
It's gotta be a good combination.

77
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:07,234
- [Mom] So today is this
girl's eight month birthday.

78
00:04:07,234 --> 00:04:09,644
My parents have a stash of water bottles.

79
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:10,925
And we all know that Jenae likes

80
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,446
water bottles 'cause they crinkle.

81
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:15,509
But they even have the lids, she's

82
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,197
in like heaven over here exploring.

83
00:04:18,197 --> 00:04:19,904
Well Papa is home from the hospital.

84
00:04:19,904 --> 00:04:22,865
And he's all showered up and
looking like himself again.

85
00:04:22,865 --> 00:04:24,125
- I'm feeling really good, I.

86
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:26,973
I'm a little bit surprised
at how good I feel.

87
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,891
And I felt like I bounced back right away.

88
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,420
- What's funny is, in the ICU

89
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,186
he was up like walking, like pretty

90
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:34,128
much the next day after his surgeries.

91
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:35,766
He's up walking the halls, they're like

92
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:37,841
you just had a heart attack, but

93
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:39,540
Papa's hard to keep laying low.

94
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,855
So what we've also been doing

95
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:43,666
is reading up about what in
the world happened to him.

96
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,368
He had some plague build
up in his arteries.

97
00:04:46,368 --> 00:04:48,477
And they came in and put in a stint.

98
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:51,405
- That's an actual stint, I got three.

99
00:04:51,405 --> 00:04:52,979
- [Mom] You got three, and we've also

100
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,610
been learning all about new medicines.

101
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,232
He gets to like have a pill bottle

102
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:58,998
and figure out what to take when.

103
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,830
- Yeah, it's like an
old fashioned computer.

104
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,331
With a lot of different
things that move around.

105
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:04,613
- It is, it is, what's interesting

106
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,026
is with several of these medicines

107
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:07,636
he has to take his blood
pressure beforehand.

108
00:05:07,636 --> 00:05:09,377
And so he's been taking his blood pressure

109
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,027
and kind of charting that so I feel

110
00:05:11,027 --> 00:05:12,310
like we're kind of figuring out how

111
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:15,194
to adjust to all of this right now.

112
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:16,884
So dad's decided to become an expert.

113
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,666
He's gonna learn all about
the heart, and everything

114
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:21,943
that's going on, ooh that
one doesn't look good.

115
00:05:21,943 --> 00:05:22,776
- [Papa] Yeah that's the bad one.

116
00:05:22,776 --> 00:05:24,247
- [Mom] That's the bad one, this is

117
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:27,990
what you want, this is
what you don't want.

118
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,738
(baby cooing)

119
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:32,571
You tell it to me, oh you're clapping.

120
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,001
You playing with Papa.

121
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,668
- [Papa] Yes, hello.

122
00:05:37,731 --> 00:05:39,370
- [Mom] Alright, Maga is making her

123
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,672
homemade spaghetti sauce.

124
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:44,639
- And we're making it low
sodium so we have to adjust.

125
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,991
- With my dad, he's recovering

126
00:05:45,991 --> 00:05:47,662
really well, we did find out that

127
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:49,265
he has more blockages in his heart

128
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,919
and he's gonna need future procedures.

129
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:52,022
And they've put him on a special

130
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:54,392
low-sodium diet and so we've been

131
00:05:54,392 --> 00:05:55,583
going through the cupboards and we've

132
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,474
been amazed at how much
sodium is in somethings.

133
00:05:58,474 --> 00:06:00,104
And what it's in and we kinda went

134
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:01,351
through and we were adding up

135
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:04,310
like what his normal day would look like.

136
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,810
(peppy music)

137
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:09,533
So I'm in charge of chopping the onions

138
00:06:09,533 --> 00:06:11,338
and it's not doing to bad on my eyes

139
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,501
yet but I keep wanting to like

140
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,874
rub my nose or something and I'm

141
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,983
nervous about getting all the onion

142
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,252
greases near my eyes 'cause
then I'll start sobbing.

143
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,835
(upbeat music)

144
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:27,361
Here's the spaghetti sauce,
doesn't that look amazing.

145
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:28,866
So, it looks like over the next

146
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:30,557
several months there's gonna be

147
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:32,305
a lot going on in our family but

148
00:06:32,305 --> 00:06:33,677
I'm just really impressed with my dad's

149
00:06:33,677 --> 00:06:38,145
attitude about it all and I
just really love that man.

150
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:40,067
I would love it, if in our vlog today

151
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,649
we could flood the comments with some

152
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:43,808
love for Papa, please share what

153
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:45,334
you love about Papa if you've been

154
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,574
watching our vlogs for very long

155
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:48,886
you know that he's a
very hands on grandpa.

156
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,318
He's always out running and playing

157
00:06:50,318 --> 00:06:51,631
with the kids and he's been that way

158
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:54,505
my whole life, that's what
I remember as a child.

159
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,145
And so, he's just an amazing man.

160
00:06:56,145 --> 00:06:57,403
My whole life that I've known him

161
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:59,677
he's been so, kind and loving

162
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,077
to others, he's always serving

163
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:03,499
and so disciplined and obedient

164
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:06,410
and faithful, I just and I could

165
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,779
talk forever about my dad
and how much I love him.

166
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,948
Except my arm is getting sore

167
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,551
holding this camera, see
this arm, totally sore.

168
00:07:13,551 --> 00:07:16,134
(upbeat music)

169
00:07:17,794 --> 00:07:18,860
So my parents have had some plants

170
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,091
in their front yard die recently

171
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:21,452
and so they've been wanting to dig

172
00:07:21,452 --> 00:07:22,940
them up and replant some fresh plants

173
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,650
and kind of clean up
some of the rock work.

174
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,848
So my sister's family is over

175
00:07:25,848 --> 00:07:29,681
here helping them with
that project right now.

176
00:07:41,765 --> 00:07:43,226
Raking rocks, that's an Arizona

177
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:45,680
thing, we don't do that where I live.

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,690
I know it's hard for my dad not

179
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,764
to be actively doing this work.

180
00:07:48,764 --> 00:07:50,494
But he's always the one helping all of us

181
00:07:50,494 --> 00:07:52,026
and so to be able to see us turn

182
00:07:52,026 --> 00:07:54,436
around and help him,
it's really kinda tender.

183
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,853
This thing is being stubborn.

184
00:07:58,104 --> 00:07:58,969
They're getting the holes ready

185
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:00,831
to come plant plants another day.

186
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:03,164
This thing was way in there.

187
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,336
- Oh, Jake got it.

188
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:09,448
- [Mom] Jenae's having fun
playing with her cousins.

189
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:12,781
Thank you guys for hanging out with her.

190
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:16,397
- Are, are you gonna open?

191
00:08:16,397 --> 00:08:18,980
(Mom laughing)

192
00:08:19,907 --> 00:08:21,809
- [Mom] Here's our yummy dinner.

193
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,452
We are having the best dessert tonight.

194
00:08:23,452 --> 00:08:24,941
This is the best cake ever, it's

195
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,303
four different kinds of cake in one cake.

196
00:08:27,303 --> 00:08:29,703
So we have chocolate, we have pumpkin,

197
00:08:29,703 --> 00:08:31,697
we have caramel and we have carrot.

198
00:08:31,697 --> 00:08:32,924
Which one are you guys gonna go for?

199
00:08:32,924 --> 00:08:34,115
Papa which one do you like?

200
00:08:34,115 --> 00:08:35,815
- According to the sodium content.

201
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:36,648
- [Mom] Uhoh.

202
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:39,722
- I can have anything but the carrot cake.

203
00:08:39,722 --> 00:08:41,421
- [Mom] My guess is he
kinda wants chocolate.

204
00:08:41,422 --> 00:08:43,121
- [Dad] Yeah I'm sort of a chocolate guy.

205
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:45,349
- My vote is that we cut each piece

206
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:47,585
into eight different pieces and we have

207
00:08:47,585 --> 00:08:51,040
like a sampler platter
and we eat all the cake.

208
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,442
- [Dad] So what're you reading?

209
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,422
- Wonder.

210
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,619
- [Dad] Can I see the cover of it?

211
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:57,374
How're you liking it?

212
00:08:57,374 --> 00:08:58,990
- I'm liking it.

213
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,621
- [Dad] What do you like about it?

214
00:09:00,621 --> 00:09:03,559
- I like that it's just
about a normal life.

215
00:09:03,559 --> 00:09:04,693
- [Dad] Yeah.

216
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:07,977
- And that, everyone has problems, so.

217
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:11,124
- So Kendra encouraged me
to read Wonder as well.

218
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,647
I'm about to finish it, I'll
probably finish it tonight.

219
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:16,566
And I don't normally read
these types of books.

220
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:19,775
And I have loved it, it's
very thought provoking.

221
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:22,298
Makes you appreciate
things, makes you think

222
00:09:22,298 --> 00:09:23,601
about other people's feelings.

223
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:25,466
What they're thinking
about and going through.

224
00:09:25,466 --> 00:09:28,644
And wanting to give love to
people who have a hard time.

225
00:09:28,644 --> 00:09:30,113
I mean some people are born with things

226
00:09:30,113 --> 00:09:32,079
that they can't control and they get

227
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,320
judged or treated poorly because of it.

228
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,649
And it makes you wanna
give extra love to them.

229
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,246
And so I have loved the book and I'm

230
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,448
excited to take Isaac to the movie.

231
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,281
- Yeah.

232
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,942
- [Dad] And to talk to
you more about it so.

233
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:45,258
(girls laughing)

234
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:49,196
You girls are goofing off,
you need to calm down for bed.

235
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:53,597
- We were going to put stickers
on your Spider-Man shirt.

236
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:55,766
- [Dad] Oh yeah, they
put stickers on my back.

237
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:56,860
- I did not.

238
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,111
- [Dad] Well I love you girls.

239
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,883
I hope you sleep well tonight.

240
00:09:59,883 --> 00:10:03,777
- I'll be scared, is it gonna
be a storm in the nighttime?

241
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,998
- [Dad] No storm, no
chance of rain tonight.

242
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,342
- Goodnight, J House out.

243
00:10:07,342 --> 00:10:08,888
- [Dad] What does it smell like Laura?

244
00:10:08,888 --> 00:10:09,721
- Poop.

245
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:11,544
- [Dad] Poop, poop, get that sock.

246
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,211
(kids laughing)

247
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,412
Here we go, one, two, three.

248
00:10:19,453 --> 00:00:00,000
(kids laughing)
