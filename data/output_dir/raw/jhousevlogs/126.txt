1
00:00:00,432 --> 00:00:01,738
- [Kendra] New pajamas.

2
00:00:01,738 --> 00:00:03,283
(bright music)

3
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:04,920
- We thought it might
help her for her audition

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,850
to practice in front of all of you.

5
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,933
- [Kendra] There he goes.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,473
- We're playing copy Janae.

7
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:13,818
(Janae squeals)

8
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:16,568
(family squeals)

9
00:00:19,195 --> 00:00:20,487
- [Kendra] You look a
little bit fancy today.

10
00:00:20,487 --> 00:00:21,473
What are you wearing?

11
00:00:21,473 --> 00:00:25,640
- Well I'm wearing my jammies
because I have jewelry on!

12
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,939
- [Kendra] So you look a little
bit like a princess today.

13
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,765
What should I call you?

14
00:00:32,765 --> 00:00:35,519
- Um, I'm a flower princes.

15
00:00:35,519 --> 00:00:37,983
- [Kendra] Flower princess.

16
00:00:37,983 --> 00:00:40,301
- Look at this toy Janae.

17
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:42,622
(laughing)

18
00:00:42,622 --> 00:00:44,838
- [Jeremy] I think Janae wants to eat it.

19
00:00:44,838 --> 00:00:47,171
- [Toy] Find the round pink.

20
00:00:49,227 --> 00:00:51,783
(Janae babbles)

21
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:53,585
- In our family we love
play based learning.

22
00:00:53,585 --> 00:00:55,207
I feel like my kids learn so well

23
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:56,792
when they're engaged in play.

24
00:00:56,792 --> 00:00:58,722
It's what we do with our big
kids when we're homeschooling

25
00:00:58,722 --> 00:00:59,915
and with our little kids.

26
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:01,875
And so I was really excited
when LeapFrog reached out

27
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,865
to offer to sponsor this video today.

28
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,231
We've used their toys with all of our kids

29
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:08,257
from the time Isaac was
born all the way down.

30
00:01:08,257 --> 00:01:09,694
And they've got some fun new toys

31
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,004
that we're excited to show you today.

32
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:13,623
- So if you press this button.

33
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:14,920
- [Caleb] There's a song.

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,290
♫ All animals have homes

35
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,654
♫ All animals have homes

36
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:25,179
- You can play games by moving this.

37
00:01:25,179 --> 00:01:27,544
- [Toy] Let's play a find it game.

38
00:01:27,544 --> 00:01:28,627
Find the key.

39
00:01:30,266 --> 00:01:31,220
K.

40
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,898
Find the apple.

41
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:34,960
- Where's the apple?

42
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,310
Good job!

43
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,798
- A says aa

44
00:01:37,798 --> 00:01:39,207
as in apple.

45
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:40,856
- [Elise] Whichever color.

46
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:42,023
- [Toy] Black.

47
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,880
- [Kendra] I love this little
clock they have up on the top.

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,940
- Look Lise, you can change the time.

49
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:48,773
- Awesome.

50
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,078
- [Toy] One o'clock.

51
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:54,576
- It's one o'clock.

52
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:55,409
- Yeah.

53
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:56,242
- So you may have noticed,

54
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,510
Laura is getting really
interested in letters.

55
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,945
What's the letter for your name?

56
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:00,818
- L.

57
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:01,758
- L.

58
00:02:01,758 --> 00:02:03,312
She has been finding Ls everywhere.

59
00:02:03,312 --> 00:02:04,382
Whether or not they're really Ls.

60
00:02:04,382 --> 00:02:05,920
Anything that looks kind of like an L,

61
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,315
she's like, "Look Mom, it's an L."

62
00:02:07,315 --> 00:02:09,235
And so this toy is perfect for her.

63
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:10,068
- Hello.

64
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:11,127
- [Caleb] What would you like?

65
00:02:11,127 --> 00:02:12,960
- Mint and strawberry.

66
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,665
I would like caramel on it.

67
00:02:18,665 --> 00:02:20,122
- How many squirts?

68
00:02:20,122 --> 00:02:21,697
- Six please.

69
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:23,234
- [Caleb] Yes.

70
00:02:23,234 --> 00:02:24,651
- [Toy] One, two.

71
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:28,397
- Now I need to pick.

72
00:02:28,397 --> 00:02:29,897
Three, four, five.

73
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:32,510
- Five.
- Thank you.

74
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,777
And here.

75
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:36,738
- Thank you.
- You have five coins.

76
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:37,974
- So Caleb, on these cards,

77
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,469
there's orders from different animals.

78
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,059
So you can fill their orders.

79
00:02:41,059 --> 00:02:43,516
And on the back there's different
games that you can play.

80
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,257
Like stacking, colors.

81
00:02:45,257 --> 00:02:46,879
Ooo, that's one's creativity.

82
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,481
- [Toy] Put a card on the register.

83
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:51,134
- What do you want?

84
00:02:51,134 --> 00:02:53,255
- [Jeremy] Do you have
any strawberry ice cream?

85
00:02:53,255 --> 00:02:54,827
- Yeah.

86
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:56,597
- [Toy] Whipped cream!

87
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:59,653
- [Jeremy] Can I have
three pumps of blueberry?

88
00:02:59,653 --> 00:03:01,973
- One, two, three.

89
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:02,977
- Three.
- I also love

90
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:05,753
that this toy is encouraging
play and taking turns.

91
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:07,121
Like the kids aren't fighting over it,

92
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,026
because they're taking turns

93
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,507
being the customer and the server.

94
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,549
So, that's awesome.

95
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:13,225
- One.
- Here's your ice cream.

96
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:14,211
Ah!

97
00:03:14,211 --> 00:03:15,291
(kids laughing)

98
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,321
Next please.

99
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,471
- I'm gonna choose all my favorite stuff.

100
00:03:18,471 --> 00:03:20,337
- Thank you LeapFrog for
sponsoring this video today.

101
00:03:20,337 --> 00:03:21,304

you can click at the link in
the description box below.

105
00:03:26,032 --> 00:03:26,865
- Oh my.

106
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,087
- [Jeremy] Holy cows.

107
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:31,141
Whoa.

108
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:32,235
- Oh my gosh.

109
00:03:32,235 --> 00:03:33,068
- Look at our tree.

110
00:03:33,068 --> 00:03:35,258
No, look at our tree!

111
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,482
I can't believe it.

112
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,721
You guys, our trampoline just.

113
00:03:39,721 --> 00:03:41,637
- Our trampoline.

114
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:43,007
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness.

115
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,370
It moved everything around.

116
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,287
(melancholy music)

117
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,683
- Whoa.

118
00:04:04,883 --> 00:04:06,478
- [Caleb] This fell off.

119
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:10,645
- [Jeremy] Yep, we lost part
of the trampoline for sure.

120
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,580
- We might have to rebuild it?

121
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,601
- [Jeremy] I don't know,
we're gonna have to see

122
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,985
if it's possible to fix it.

123
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:20,344
What do you think of the trampoline Laura?

124
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,541
- Sad.

125
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:22,714
- [Jeremy] It's pretty sad, huh?

126
00:04:22,714 --> 00:04:26,214
- Yeah, but that tornado watch was so bad.

127
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,679
- [Jeremy] It was crazy, huh?

128
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,512
- Yeah.

129
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:30,345
- [Jeremy] So guys look.

130
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:32,373
It actually flipped it again last night.

131
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,138
During the storm when we were sleeping.

132
00:04:34,138 --> 00:04:35,816
'Cause it used to be on its head

133
00:04:35,816 --> 00:04:38,460
and then it flipped over
again back onto its feet.

134
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,989
- How did it flip again?

135
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,171
- [Jeremy] Just more wind
came and did it again.

136
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:43,220
- I'll just watch you guys.

137
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,626
- [Jeremy] You just wanna
watch us pull it out?

138
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:45,459
- Yeah.

139
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,039
- We're gonna get a new--
- Dad, we could just pull on

140
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:48,818
that branch.

141
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:51,401
(bright music)

142
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:54,581
- [Jeremy] Nice.

143
00:04:57,528 --> 00:04:59,076
Oop, you're getting all wet.

144
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:01,373
- [Kendra] Ms. Laura, are you
still nervous about the storm

145
00:05:01,373 --> 00:05:02,256
the other night?

146
00:05:02,256 --> 00:05:03,360
- Yeah.

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,466
And look!
- It was a pretty big storm.

148
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:07,039
- That tree fell down.

149
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,925
- [Kendra] Yeah, that tree
fell down a few years ago.

150
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:10,982
But it was a big tree when it fell down.

151
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:12,791
- Let's flash back to that.

152
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,769
- [Kendra] When that tree fell down?

153
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:16,602
- It's hailing guys, it's hailing.

154
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,231
Our tree just fell down.

155
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:25,064
Do you guys see that?

156
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,021
Our tree just fell down in our yard.

157
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:29,259
- Dad, don't pull that tree down.

158
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,930
- [Kendra] Okay, he's just
gonna move the trampoline.

159
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,465
- Okay, you guys ready?

160
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:33,298
Okay everyone, stand back.

161
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:35,126
I'm gonna pull the trampoline out.

162
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,393
- [Kendra] Oh Jeremy, I
think maybe pulling it

163
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:39,286
is gonna actually destroy it.

164
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:41,430
I think we may have to lift it.

165
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,280
- [Jeremy] Because of the branches?

166
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,504
- [Kendra] Yeah.

167
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:45,797
There we go, there we go, that's good.

168
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:47,169
There he goes.

169
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:49,919
(dramatic music)

170
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,239
(clapping and cheering)

171
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:01,739
(happy music)

172
00:06:06,463 --> 00:06:08,245
- It looks like we can repair it.

173
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,684
It looks pretty easy.

174
00:06:09,684 --> 00:06:11,056
- Let's see.

175
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,857
- [Elise] Go Daddy, you're amazing.

176
00:06:12,857 --> 00:06:14,524
Do do do, boop boop!

177
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:18,179
(kids cheering and clapping)

178
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,489
- [Isaac] Uh oh.

179
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:20,555
- [Kendra] This is the harder one.

180
00:06:20,555 --> 00:06:21,972
'Cause it's bent.

181
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:28,109
I'm not seeing this ending well.

182
00:06:28,109 --> 00:06:29,697
Oh babe.

183
00:06:29,697 --> 00:06:31,326
- If you'll hold that down
there and I'll bend it.

184
00:06:31,326 --> 00:06:32,179
- [Kendra] Okay, everybody hold

185
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:34,246
the other side of the trampoline.

186
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:35,110
- You guys ready?

187
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,943
Hold on three.

188
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:37,727
One, two, three.

189
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:39,168
One, two, three.

190
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:40,523
One, two, three.

191
00:06:40,523 --> 00:06:42,188
One, two, three.

192
00:06:42,188 --> 00:06:43,230
One, two, three.

193
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,063
Okay.

194
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:44,896
- [Kendra] Hey!

195
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,051
That last one seemed to do something.

196
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:49,634
- Yeah, but I think I
might've weakened it.

197
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:55,015
(kids clapping and cheering)
(triumphant music)

198
00:06:56,094 --> 00:06:58,279
- [Kendra] Dad's testing it for us.

199
00:06:58,279 --> 00:06:59,779
So the actual mat of the trampoline

200
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:02,514
did not get torn or
ripped, which is amazing.

201
00:07:02,514 --> 00:07:03,347
- Or the net.

202
00:07:03,347 --> 00:07:05,388
- And the net is actually good too.

203
00:07:05,388 --> 00:07:07,317
So Laura's really nervous
about Jeremy trying this

204
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,470
and I don't think it's
honestly gonna work.

205
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,560
I think we're gonna have to get a ladder

206
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,578
and a chainsaw.

207
00:07:11,578 --> 00:07:13,163
But Jeremy's gonna give pulling a try,

208
00:07:13,163 --> 00:07:15,499
which you know, you gotta try.

209
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:17,517
You pull that thing right down.

210
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:20,184
(playful music)

211
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:25,681
I just think it's still a
little too much attached

212
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,265
to be able to pull it off.

213
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,932
But Jeremy's trying!

214
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,275
(laughing)

215
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:38,569
- (growls) I think I'm
making a difference.

216
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,260
- [Kendra] You just stay out here babe.

217
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,423
You give it a couple hours.

218
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:42,494
- I'm gonna get it.

219
00:07:42,494 --> 00:07:43,789
I'm gonna wear it down.

220
00:07:43,789 --> 00:07:45,072
- I love that with this vlog,

221
00:07:45,072 --> 00:07:48,956
we now have records of some of
Jeremy's awesomely inventive

222
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:50,630
ways of solving problems.

223
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,519
My favorite is when he
throws socks at wasps.

224
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,472
(squealing)

225
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:57,972
- It's going down.

226
00:07:59,227 --> 00:08:00,645
Victorious.

227
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:02,198
I killed the wasp.

228
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:03,062
That worked.

229
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:03,895
- It did.

230
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:04,728
It did.

231
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:05,561
I'm not denying his methods.

232
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:08,207
I'm just glad we have them
chronicled for posterity.

233
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:10,652
We vlogged about the story
when he got stuck on the roof

234
00:08:10,652 --> 00:08:11,885
with the baby pool.

235
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:13,067
(laughing)

236
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:13,900
That was a funny one.
- Wait.

237
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,359
He got stuck on the roof?

238
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,658
- [Kendra] Yep, with a pair
of pants and a baby pool.

239
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:18,491
- [Jeremy] That's true.

240
00:08:18,491 --> 00:08:20,027
- [Kendra] That's a good story.

241
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:21,743
- [Man] Shall we begin?

242
00:08:21,743 --> 00:08:24,326
(upbeat music)

243
00:08:28,511 --> 00:08:29,844
Let's begin now.

244
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:48,382
- [Jeremy] You doing drills?

245
00:08:48,382 --> 00:08:49,215
- Yeah.

246
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:50,087
- [Kendra] What you
guys doing this morning?

247
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:51,365
- Oh, we're playing house.

248
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,345
I'm pregnant and she's my daughter.

249
00:08:53,345 --> 00:08:54,552
And we're at the library.

250
00:08:54,552 --> 00:08:56,219
- And she's my mom.

251
00:08:56,219 --> 00:08:58,422
And I'm pregnant.

252
00:08:58,422 --> 00:09:01,505
- This is slash, phone, slash tablet.

253
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:05,663
It's gonna be a girl
and Caleb's my husband.

254
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:08,738
- And mine is gonna be
a girl too. (laughs)

255
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,288
- [Kendra] So what are you
gonna name your baby girl?

256
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,651
- We don't know, but.

257
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:14,402
- I'm gonna name mine Scary.

258
00:09:14,402 --> 00:09:16,724
- [Kendra] You're gonna
name your baby girl Scary?

259
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:17,557
- Yeah.

260
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,106
- [Kendra] Awesome.

261
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:20,760
- And she does not like that name.

262
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,513
So I'm gonna name her Nice.

263
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:24,346
- [Kendra] Nice?

264
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,057
- Um hmm.
- Nice is a good name too.

265
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,493
- She didn't like that name

266
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:29,743
so I'm gonna name her, Aly.

267
00:09:30,745 --> 00:09:31,578
- [Kendra] Aly.

268
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:33,411
Scary, Nice or Aly, which one?

269
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:34,925
- I'm gonna name her Aly.

270
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:35,876
- Hello?

271
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,473
There's a tornado watch.

272
00:09:37,473 --> 00:09:39,807
(Elise imitates tornado siren)

273
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:43,336
- Come on, we gotta go somewhere safe.

274
00:09:43,336 --> 00:09:45,063
This is the best place.

275
00:09:45,063 --> 00:09:47,483
Is there any place for shelter?

276
00:09:47,483 --> 00:09:48,316
Okay.

277
00:09:48,316 --> 00:09:50,917
They said it's over here.

278
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:53,032
- [Caleb] I looked up
this thing for you guys.

279
00:09:53,032 --> 00:09:53,865
- [Elise] Really?

280
00:09:53,865 --> 00:09:55,898
- [Caleb] They said it's
coming to the library.

281
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:57,065
- Where is it?

282
00:09:58,257 --> 00:10:00,061
- [Caleb] It's by our destination.

283
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,565
- Okay.

284
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,154
- [Caleb] We have to go.

285
00:10:03,154 --> 00:10:05,155
- Ice cream break.

286
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:06,427
(sighs)

287
00:10:06,427 --> 00:10:08,344
- Guys, we better move!

288
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:10,830
- [Jeremy] Is this the ice cream break

289
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,420
during the tornado watch/warning?

290
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,079
- Um, look where the tornado is.

291
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:17,366
- [Jeremy] Uh oh, better
put the ice cream away.

292
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,449
- Bye.

293
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,177
- [Jeremy] Oh, she
still's got her ice cream.

294
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:22,522
- Isaac and I are doing logic
puzzles today for school.

295
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,456
It's awesome and tricky.

296
00:10:24,456 --> 00:10:25,977
Like some of 'em he gets quicker than me

297
00:10:25,977 --> 00:10:27,586
and some of 'em I'm like oh I got this

298
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,291
and so it's fun to
figure 'em out together.

299
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,722
The current one has Isaac stumped.

300
00:10:30,722 --> 00:10:32,075
But I know you're gonna get it.

301
00:10:32,075 --> 00:10:34,387
- Oh it was an early sell out.

302
00:10:34,387 --> 00:10:35,220
- Let's see.

303
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,485
So you changed your job, huh?

304
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,318
- Um hmm.

305
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,151
- [Kendra] What's your job now?

306
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:38,984
- Make movies.

307
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:39,944
- You're a movie maker.

308
00:10:39,944 --> 00:10:41,330
And is that how you make movies?

309
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,512
With your hand doing that?

310
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:45,939
(laughing) Somebody's
been watching Daddy edit.

311
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,745
It's time to go through the kids' clothes

312
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:49,749
and figure out what fits
them and what doesn't.

313
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:51,068
And I was going through
Caleb's this morning.

314
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:52,727
He didn't fit any of
his long sleeve shirts.

315
00:10:52,727 --> 00:10:53,560
So we're gonna have Caleb

316
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,713
try on these old clothes of Isaac's

317
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:55,546
and see what fits him

318
00:10:55,546 --> 00:10:57,075
and what else we need to go buy for him.

319
00:10:57,075 --> 00:10:58,075
- Star Wars.

320
00:10:58,939 --> 00:10:59,772
- [Kendra] Alright, what do you think?

321
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:00,990
Does the Star Wars shirt fit?

322
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,823
- Uh huh.

323
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:02,891
- [Kendra] How about the
pants, do the pants fit?

324
00:11:02,891 --> 00:11:03,795
- Um hmm.
- What do you think

325
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:04,871
of the shirt?

326
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:06,317
- I like it.

327
00:11:06,317 --> 00:11:07,507
Namaste.

328
00:11:07,507 --> 00:11:08,675
- [Kendra] Namaste!

329
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,640
(laughing)

330
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,758
You're fun to do this with.

331
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:12,623
- Completely orange.

332
00:11:12,623 --> 00:11:13,939
Namaste.

333
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,647
- [Kendra] It says football fever.

334
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:16,480
- Like it.

335
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,284
I'm gonna go show Elise.

336
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:19,314
- [Kendra] I like that one.

337
00:11:19,314 --> 00:11:20,722
- It has a hood.

338
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,662
- [Kendra] Do you like that?

339
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:22,495
- Um hmm.

340
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,808
I think it fits me.

341
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:26,322
Namaste.

342
00:11:26,322 --> 00:11:28,586
- [Kendra] (laughing) Turn around.

343
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,586
Shake your bummity bum.

344
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:33,227
- Feels like a real basketball.

345
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:34,926
How did they do that?

346
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:36,597
- [Kendra] I think it's on backwards.

347
00:11:36,597 --> 00:11:37,669
Turn it around.

348
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:38,559
Is it too big?

349
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,392
- No.

350
00:11:39,392 --> 00:11:41,309
- [Kendra] New pajamas.

351
00:11:43,698 --> 00:11:45,556
- This is a good one for building.

352
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:47,556
- [Kendra] You think so?

353
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:52,985
You're so good at keeping
this entertaining.

354
00:11:52,985 --> 00:11:55,818
This is Janae's new favorite spot.

355
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:59,870
Hi, you playing with your big brother?

356
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,411
Laura said she has something
she wants to show me.

357
00:12:02,411 --> 00:12:04,796
- [Laura] Hello, my name is L.

358
00:12:04,796 --> 00:12:06,198
- [Kendra] Oh, is this an L?

359
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,950
- [Laura] Yeah, but I'm having fun.

360
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:11,463
I'm playing with sprinklers.

361
00:12:11,463 --> 00:12:13,758
- [Kendra] What else can you make?

362
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,490
- A bended L.

363
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,013
- [Kendra] Is it a bended L?

364
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,287
Alright, dinner tonight is
chicken penne pasta casserole,

365
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,454
rolls, grapes and veggies.

366
00:12:24,614 --> 00:12:25,738
(Janae babbles)

367
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:28,488
(family babbles)

368
00:12:31,513 --> 00:12:34,180
(Jeremy laughs)

369
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,838
(Janae squeals)

370
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:42,927
(family squeals)

371
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:44,630
- We're playing copy Janae.

372
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,426
It's a super fun game.

373
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:48,474
And she loves it.

374
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:49,317
- [Kendra] See if we can get her to do it.

375
00:12:49,317 --> 00:12:50,567
Ready, arms up.

376
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,589
(all clapping)

377
00:12:55,573 --> 00:12:57,620
- Having a baby and four other kids,

378
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,499
like each kid make it
exponentially more fun,

379
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:03,054
when you start just
playing games with them.

380
00:13:03,054 --> 00:13:04,185
It's really fun.

381
00:13:04,185 --> 00:13:08,166
- And exponentially louder,
with a little bit (mumbles).

382
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:11,919
- So, Elise has kind of an
exciting opportunity tomorrow.

383
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,752
What are you doing?

384
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,254
- I'm auditioning for a solo.

385
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:18,160
- She's been practicing this
week and she loves to sing.

386
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
She's always going
around our house singing,

387
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,883
so she's been practicing.

388
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,092
We thought it might help
her for her audition

389
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:25,852
to practice in front of all of you.

390
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:26,945
So here we go.

391
00:13:26,945 --> 00:13:29,016
Sing it for us.

392
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,979
♫ I adore you

393
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,312
♫ Tiny baby

394
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:37,863
♫ I adore you

395
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,387
♫ Blessed son

396
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,635
♫ I adore you

397
00:13:44,635 --> 00:13:47,468
♫ Lord and Father

398
00:13:48,309 --> 00:13:50,809
♫ I adore you

399
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,845
♫ Holy one

400
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:57,723
♫ You are my hope

401
00:13:57,723 --> 00:14:00,399
♫ You are my life

402
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,732
♫ You are my everything

403
00:14:05,462 --> 00:14:08,421
♫ You are my peace

404
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,309
♫ My all in all

405
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,642
♫ My savior and my king

406
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:20,196
♫ You make me want to sing

407
00:14:23,474 --> 00:14:25,324
- That was amazing.

408
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,236
Good job.

409
00:14:26,236 --> 00:14:28,138
I'm so proud of you.

410
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:29,747
We're gonna keep working on it

411
00:14:29,747 --> 00:14:32,137
and Elise is gonna do
her audition tomorrow

412
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:34,166
and we talked about how I remember for me,

413
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,707
I auditioned for plays and stuff.

414
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:39,244
And my first six or seven, I
didn't end up making the show.

415
00:14:39,244 --> 00:14:42,060
But auditioning was such a good practice.

416
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,255
And such a good thing to
eventually where I did get to be

417
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:46,774
the star of shows and
singing solos and stuff.

418
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:49,441
And so--
- This is my first solo.

419
00:14:50,328 --> 00:14:51,974
- Audition?
- Uh huh.

420
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,298
Oh my whole life.

421
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:54,508
- Well I think it'll be good for you,

422
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:57,322
regardless of what happens,
and go in and keep taking

423
00:14:57,322 --> 00:15:00,302
deep breaths and be
confident and do your best.

424
00:15:00,302 --> 00:15:02,030
And we'll see what happens.

425
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,331
Thanks so much for helping us out

426
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:04,470
and watching our family.

427
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,493
We love you guys.

428
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:07,013
J House out.

429
00:15:07,013 --> 00:15:08,473
- Oh my.

430
00:15:08,473 --> 00:15:09,306
- [Kendra] Whoa.

431
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,726
- [Jeremy] Oh my gosh.

432
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:12,638
No.

433
00:15:12,638 --> 00:15:13,956
Is it a tornado?

434
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:14,838
You guys go downstairs.

435
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,338
Go downstairs and.

436
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:20,006
- I hope our house doesn't break.

437
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,234
- Our trampoline.
(Kendra gasps)

438
00:15:23,234 --> 00:00:00,000
- Oh my!
