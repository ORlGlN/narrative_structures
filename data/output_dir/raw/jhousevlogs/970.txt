1
00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:02,103
- [Caleb] Elise?

2
00:00:02,103 --> 00:00:04,270
Elise, it's snowing, look.

3
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:09,984
- Wow!

4
00:00:11,026 --> 00:00:11,859
- [Jeremy] It's beautiful, huh?

5
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:14,708
- I want to play out there right now.

6
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,010
- [Jeremy] Should we go
out and play out there?

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,843
- Yeah.

8
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:21,032
- [Jeremy] We gotta eat
breakfast first, okay?

9
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:25,199
("Dance Of The Sugarplum
Fairy" by Tchaikovsky)

10
00:00:27,824 --> 00:00:29,584
- It snowed.

11
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:30,725
- [Jeremy] Did it snow?

12
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:34,808
- And now we're gonna
build a snowman, a big one.

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,388
- [Jeremy] You ready?

14
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:39,638
- For the snow!

15
00:00:40,505 --> 00:00:42,500
- [Jeremy] Lets see your little outfit.

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,333
- So...

17
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:45,998
November was a little bit of a crazy month

18
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,613
and I neglected the ever important chore

19
00:00:48,613 --> 00:00:51,506
of figuring out the winter stuff.

20
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:54,723
So here we have our first snow

21
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:57,863
and I have all of this stuff (laughs)

22
00:00:57,863 --> 00:01:00,530
and I have no idea what fits who

23
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:03,526
and it's kind of a mess.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,851
Thankfully we've been
donated a lot of stuff,

25
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:09,112
like people gave us hand-me-down's,

26
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,582
and we love hand-me-down's,

27
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:12,864
but it also means there's
no order to the chaos.

28
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,331
I have no idea what we have.

29
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:15,596
So we'll see what happens.

30
00:01:15,596 --> 00:01:16,899
Finally have all the kids dressed.

31
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:19,674
Caleb, show me your outfit!

32
00:01:19,674 --> 00:01:20,674
There he is.

33
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,232
So we found something for everybody

34
00:01:24,232 --> 00:01:29,124
but unfortunately Elise fits
Isaac's boots from last year

35
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:33,028
and Isaac fits Elise's grow-in
boots that somebody gave us

36
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:34,594
so they're barbie boots.

37
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,677
But he's being a good sport about it.

38
00:01:38,545 --> 00:01:42,712
(gentle acoustic instrumental music)

39
00:01:43,843 --> 00:01:45,512
- Snowball fight!

40
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:46,898
- [Jeremy] Ow!

41
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,385
(giggling)

42
00:01:49,385 --> 00:01:50,552
Oh, good shot!

43
00:01:55,783 --> 00:01:58,116
Ooh, nice snow angel, Lisee.

44
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:02,035
So good.

45
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:06,975
Did you feel like you were left out?

46
00:02:06,975 --> 00:02:10,805
(laughing and yelling)

47
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:11,638
Woo!

48
00:02:16,149 --> 00:02:16,982
Aaaaah!

49
00:02:19,283 --> 00:02:22,584
(laughs) Did you trap me?

50
00:02:22,584 --> 00:02:25,917
- [Kendra] Are you just eating the snow?

51
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:29,826
- Camera fight?

52
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,998
Oh, at the face, Jeremy.

53
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:35,665
You're going brutal.

54
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:39,622
Okay let me have the baby,
let me have the baby.

55
00:02:39,622 --> 00:02:42,105
No, mommy gets the baby.

56
00:02:42,105 --> 00:02:43,124
- This snow is amazing.

57
00:02:43,124 --> 00:02:46,226
It only takes one hand
to pack a whole snowball.

58
00:02:46,226 --> 00:02:47,530
Oh, good shot!

59
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,038
We were taking a picture...

60
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:51,038
(thump)

61
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:56,017
(laughing) They're slammin' me!

62
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:56,850
No, no!

63
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,338
In the face!

64
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:03,647
No!

65
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:07,064
(laughing and squealing)

66
00:03:10,488 --> 00:03:12,975
I'm gonna go into the fort.

67
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,808
I'm gonna go into our
fort and really get 'em.

68
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,260
My secret hideout.

69
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,464
- I'm hunting.

70
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,381
- [Jeremy] You're hunting?

71
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,881
- I'm hunting Dad.

72
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:30,245
Ow, no!

73
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:31,263
In the neck!

74
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,178
The back of the neck!

75
00:03:33,178 --> 00:03:35,297
(laughing)

76
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:39,464
(jazz version of "We Wish
You A Merry Christmas")

77
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,901
- [Kendra] Good pushing,
you push that snow.

78
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:48,124
You helping, Cub?

79
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:49,996
Where's your gloves, dude?

80
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:51,461
You can't get it big?

81
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,842
- Come help Isaac.

82
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:55,675
- [Kendra] Lisee, you helping dad?

83
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:01,161
(grunting)

84
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:14,118
- It think this is a good spot.

85
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:16,535
Two, three, let's roll it up.

86
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,753
Alright, here's our snowman.

87
00:04:28,579 --> 00:04:31,473
What do you think, Isaac, was that fun?

88
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:34,288
- [Isaac] Yeah, can we do
a snowball fight some more?

89
00:04:34,288 --> 00:04:35,621
- [Jeremy] Sure.

90
00:04:39,056 --> 00:04:41,707
- [Kendra] Good job, boys, good job.

91
00:04:41,707 --> 00:04:42,874
What a helper!

92
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,164
(sniffles)

93
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:00,389
- [Jeremy] So not your
typical snowy weather activity

94
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:02,510
but when you wanna ride a tricycle,

95
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,789
you ride a tricycle, right, Caleb?

96
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:05,622
- Uh-huh.

97
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:09,078
(wheels squeaking)

98
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:11,973
- So what we've told the kids

99
00:05:11,973 --> 00:05:16,173
is that the house has to
be super clean this weekend

100
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,215
because Christmas is coming.

101
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,819
But really the house has to be super clean

102
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,593
because a surprise is coming.

103
00:05:23,593 --> 00:05:25,181
- It's exciting.

104
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,348
- So, short story, our house
has to look really good...

105
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:32,511
By tomorrow.

106
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:33,650
- So one of the things that we did

107
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,852
is go through all of our paperwork.

108
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:37,442
- [Kendra] There's a mountain.

109
00:05:37,442 --> 00:05:39,684
- This entire room was covered in paper.

110
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:43,851
We had every mortgage statement
of the last eight months,

111
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:48,651
because we've had it stacked
up in our to-file pile,

112
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:51,382
which was this growing lump of death.

113
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:53,135
- [Kendra] It's been a disaster.

114
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:54,156
- It's funny, we would have, like,

115
00:05:54,156 --> 00:05:55,624
a Skype going on with someone

116
00:05:55,624 --> 00:05:57,050
and the lump of death would be back there.

117
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,110
Like, "Let's move it."

118
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,277
So we'd carry (laughs) the to-file pile

119
00:06:04,062 --> 00:06:06,224
out and lean it up against a couch

120
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:08,829
and then we'd have to move
it back and it keeps growing.

121
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:10,049
- We've had times in our life

122
00:06:10,049 --> 00:06:12,900
when we stay super on top of filing,

123
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,593
and we have a great filing
system, but it's a slippery slope

124
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:17,712
and once you start down the slippery slope

125
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:20,606
it gets overwhelming, and
it grows, and it grows.

126
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:23,251
And anyway, we finally did it!

127
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,878
We've got, like, three bags of trash

128
00:06:24,878 --> 00:06:27,204
that we're throwing away.

129
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:28,143
We're so close.

130
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:28,976
These are like

131
00:06:28,976 --> 00:06:32,886
the "I don't know what to
do with these" papers left.

132
00:06:32,886 --> 00:06:36,455
- I mean, every month
I go through the mail

133
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:37,799
and we make sure that we're--

134
00:06:37,799 --> 00:06:39,142
- [Kendra] I go through
the mail when it comes in.

135
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:40,241
- Yeah, we go through the mail

136
00:06:40,241 --> 00:06:41,995
so that we make sure that we're

137
00:06:41,995 --> 00:06:43,380
paying bills or whatever needs to be done

138
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,357
and honestly most of my
bills are just auto-pay.

139
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,189
So with getting the filing done

140
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,370
and trying to clean the house,

141
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,575
it's going to be a little
bit of a later night for us

142
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:54,264
but it's gonna be an exciting weekend.

143
00:06:54,264 --> 00:06:55,264
J House out.

144
00:07:01,482 --> 00:07:03,982
(disco music)

145
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:13,787
- [Kendra] Everybody to the back.

146
00:07:13,787 --> 00:07:14,620
(thump)

147
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,037
- Oh, my stomach.

148
00:07:17,194 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] (laughing) What was that?
