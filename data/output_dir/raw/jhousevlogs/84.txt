1
00:00:00,705 --> 00:00:04,380
♪ This is the best tortellini ever ♪

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,297
- That's beautiful Mom.

3
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:09,117
How did you do it?

4
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:10,859
- It's like stars.

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:13,413
- I'm on a kind of emotional
rollercoaster right now.

6
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:15,996
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:22,724
(vacuum)

8
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,391
You like the vacuum?

9
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:35,008
Thanks for doing your chores buddy.

10
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:37,591
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,176
- Present?

12
00:00:46,176 --> 00:00:48,754
- [Jeremy] Nope, the box
had our new camera in it.

13
00:00:48,754 --> 00:00:52,840
I'm still bummed that we lost
our camera and that footage.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,836
But it's good to have a new camera here.

15
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:58,419
(upbeat music)

16
00:01:01,618 --> 00:01:02,825
- Well we finished up our morning chores

17
00:01:02,825 --> 00:01:04,867
and so now the kids and I
are gonna sit down and read.

18
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,331
I love at Christmas time that

19
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:07,678
there's so many fun books to read.

20
00:01:07,678 --> 00:01:09,907
So it's nice to just spend some
time cozied up and reading.

21
00:01:09,907 --> 00:01:14,064
Land at the tree a long
time before Alec was born.

22
00:01:14,064 --> 00:01:17,152
Digging carefully he moved the
little spruce from the shade.

23
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:18,940
Today we're making paper snowflakes

24
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,705
that we're gonna hang up on
the windows to decorate with.

25
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,889
What's the first step Isaac?

26
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:23,259
- Make it into a square.

27
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,676
- [Kendra] Make your paper into a square.

28
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:28,782
- Perfect.

29
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,803
(upbeat music)

30
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,393
(laughter)

31
00:01:38,393 --> 00:01:41,203
- [Kendra] Did it cut in half?

32
00:01:41,203 --> 00:01:42,248
- I'm ready to open mine.

33
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:43,081
- [Kendra] Okay, let's see the reveal.

34
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:44,955
(piano music)

35
00:01:44,955 --> 00:01:46,523
I love it.

36
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,241
- [Isaac] It even has hearts.

37
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:51,376
I tried to, I cut it like that.

38
00:01:51,376 --> 00:01:52,839
- [Kendra] Nice, do you
wanna make another one?

39
00:01:52,839 --> 00:01:54,023
- Oh yeah.

40
00:01:54,023 --> 00:01:56,090
(upbeat music)

41
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,320
- [Kendra] Nice work buddy.

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,070
That looks fantastic.

43
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:03,999
That is beautiful.

44
00:02:06,354 --> 00:02:09,353
- I've never made anything like it.

45
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,186
- Wow.

46
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:13,185
A snowflake.

47
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:15,135
- [Kendra] It's beautiful Laura.

48
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,157
- Can I hang it up?

49
00:02:16,157 --> 00:02:17,132
- [Kendra] Sure.

50
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:18,641
I love how you did this.

51
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,141
(piano music)

52
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,048
- It looks like the star.

53
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:28,370
- [Kendra] Did you make a tiny one?

54
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,620
That is so fun.

55
00:02:30,669 --> 00:02:32,805
So Elise made a little, tiny one.

56
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:33,827
I like it.

57
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:36,730
- It's not really the
shape of a real snowflake.

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,169
- [Kendra] That's okay.

59
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:39,888
- It looks like a car.

60
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:42,024
- [Kendra] It does look like a car.

61
00:02:42,024 --> 00:02:43,607
Okay, let's see it.

62
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,502
(piano music)

63
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:50,035
That's awesome.

64
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:53,355
- Well I made like a carousel.

65
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:56,072
- [Kendra] Would you like
to open this one Miss Laura?

66
00:02:56,072 --> 00:02:58,572
(piano music)

67
00:02:59,508 --> 00:03:02,758
Opp, did I accidentally cut it in half?

68
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,753
Does it work even?

69
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,796
- You can just tape it.

70
00:03:08,796 --> 00:03:10,097
- [Kendra] I accidentally cut it in half.

71
00:03:10,097 --> 00:03:12,651
(laughter)

72
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,368
Okay, Mom's snowflake fail.

73
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:18,456
Well mine didn't work,
so I'm gonna try again.

74
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:19,789
This one's mine.

75
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:22,705
Will you open it for me Elise?

76
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:24,075
So gently.

77
00:03:24,075 --> 00:03:25,863
- [Elise] Whoa!

78
00:03:25,863 --> 00:03:28,363
(piano music)

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,880
- That is beautiful Mom.

80
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:36,451
- [Elise] How did you do it?

81
00:03:36,451 --> 00:03:38,680
- [Kendra] I just made lots of cuts.

82
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,631
Isn't that so fun?

83
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,674
Got the snowflakes all put up.

84
00:03:42,674 --> 00:03:45,174
(piano music)

85
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:57,512
How's your baby?

86
00:03:57,512 --> 00:03:59,068
- Good and a got a phone.

87
00:03:59,068 --> 00:04:00,182
- [Kendra] What are you working on today?

88
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:03,503
- I'm working on getting the basement

89
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,420
ready for a light show.

90
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:08,797
- I'm making lunch.

91
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:12,303
I like making tortellini
and mac and cheese

92
00:04:12,303 --> 00:04:13,719
and stuff like that.

93
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:15,716
- [Kendra] Good job.

94
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:16,738
- Thanks.

95
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:17,853
- I love letting my kids
work in the kitchen.

96
00:04:17,853 --> 00:04:18,874
So are the noodles ready?

97
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:19,966
- Yep.

98
00:04:19,966 --> 00:04:20,918
- [Kendra] Do you want me
to help you drain them?

99
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:21,986
- Yeah.

100
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:23,054
- [Kendra] So this pot is really heavy.

101
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,145
Even though I love having Isaac and Elise

102
00:04:24,145 --> 00:04:25,260
helping in the kitchen, I still help

103
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,010
with a lot of these
parts because it's safer.

104
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,574
Good job, should we add some sauce?

105
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:33,526
- Yeah.

106
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:34,548
- [Kendra] Do you like tortellini?

107
00:04:34,548 --> 00:04:35,918
- Yes, I love it.

108
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,401
I like it more alone than with the sauce.

109
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,281
- [Kendra] Here's how
Isaac's meal turned out.

110
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,884
Thanks for cooking it Isaac.

111
00:04:42,884 --> 00:04:45,531
- These are really good cooked.

112
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:50,059
♪ This is the best tortellini ever ♪

113
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:52,729
♪ It is so good ♪

114
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,865
♪ Fa la la la la ♪

115
00:04:54,865 --> 00:04:56,142
- [Jeremy] I heard you made it.

116
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,350
Thanks man.

117
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,859
- So good.

118
00:04:58,859 --> 00:05:01,109
- [Jeremy] You singing too?

119
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:04,409
- A big blessing in our life

120
00:05:04,409 --> 00:05:06,731
is the fact that since
Jeremy works from home

121
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,729
and the kids are home schooled,

122
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:09,447
we get to enjoy lunch
together during the day.

123
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:10,840
It's a real treat to be able to sit down

124
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,116
and talk about school and talk about work

125
00:05:13,116 --> 00:05:14,649
and kind of reconnect.

126
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,232
(guitar music)

127
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:20,009
Hi baby.

128
00:05:21,057 --> 00:05:22,334
- The last couple of weeks have been

129
00:05:22,334 --> 00:05:23,774
really tough for me at work.

130
00:05:23,774 --> 00:05:25,237
There's some situations going on that

131
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:28,813
are really impacting me
personally with fear and anxiety.

132
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:30,067
I'm trying to be optimistic and positive

133
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:33,178
and sometimes that hard to do.

134
00:05:33,178 --> 00:05:36,150
I'm on a kind of emotional
roller coaster right now.

135
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,379
What's really been helping
me through this hard time

136
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,466
is I've been watching a
documentary on John Adams.

137
00:05:42,466 --> 00:05:45,369
Looking at how difficult things
were during the Revolution

138
00:05:45,369 --> 00:05:47,760
and just some of things
that really inspire

139
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,293
me about people from the past,

140
00:05:49,293 --> 00:05:51,220
seem to put things in perspective

141
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,310
and help me realize that my
problems aren't that huge.

142
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,701
I just find a lot of inspiration from

143
00:05:55,701 --> 00:05:57,838
how they dealt with tough situations.

144
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:01,838
- Caleb is reading books
to Laura, it's so cute.

145
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:06,104
- Made one of his boots
usually gave him _.

146
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:08,187
The _ did not take back _

147
00:06:10,376 --> 00:06:12,327
so he was ready first.

148
00:06:12,327 --> 00:06:13,910
You have one hour _

149
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:19,943
whoever matches the most
children with a gift wins.

150
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:20,872
- [Kendra] You're a great reader,

151
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:21,986
thanks for reading to Laura.

152
00:06:21,986 --> 00:06:23,008
- Thanks.

153
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,051
- Yesterday there was
just a lot of bickering

154
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,095
between the kids, it felt like,

155
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,883
I felt like all day I was dealing

156
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,764
with one argument after another.

157
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:34,363
Today, the kids are doing so well.

158
00:06:34,363 --> 00:06:36,406
I keep finding them
playing nicely together

159
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:39,053
and doing nice things for each other.

160
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,678
I don't know what was in the air

161
00:06:40,678 --> 00:06:42,281
that was different yesterday versus today.

162
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,604
It's just a good reminder that sometimes

163
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,880
when I'm having a bad day or
the kids are having a bad day,

164
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,250
I'm like oh my goodness,

165
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,618
everything is wrong in life and the world.

166
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:51,785
Some days it's just a day.

167
00:06:55,162 --> 00:06:57,380
Today's a good day and that's nice.

168
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,957
So the kids are playing in their fort.

169
00:06:59,957 --> 00:07:02,374
What do you think Miss Jenae?

170
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:05,919
Are there lights over here?

171
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,086
Here, crawl in, show
Jenae-nae how to go in there.

172
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:15,044
You see the lights, you're pointing to it.

173
00:07:15,044 --> 00:07:17,621
So the big kids and Jeremy
built this light fort yesterday

174
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:19,665
and Jenae didn't get a chance to see it

175
00:07:19,665 --> 00:07:20,849
because she was napping.

176
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,567
So this is her first time crawling in

177
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,518
and seeing all the lights.

178
00:07:24,518 --> 00:07:25,470
She just keeps pointing at them,

179
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,654
she doesn't really know
what to do with it.

180
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,154
What do you think?

181
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:31,019
- It's like stars.

182
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,338
- Looks like stars in here?

183
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:34,523
- Isn't it hot?

184
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:35,475
- Yeah.

185
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:36,589
- [Kendra] What's your favorite color?

186
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,785
- Red.

187
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:38,618
- [Kendra] Which one's
your favorite Laura?

188
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,061
- Pink.

189
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,524
- Our family loves reading Christmas books

190
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:42,963
so I thought it would be fun this year

191
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,007
for the kids to write
their own Christmas book.

192
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,178
Today the kids job is to brainstorm five

193
00:07:47,178 --> 00:07:48,965
different Christmas book ideas.

194
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,684
Then they're going to write it up,

195
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,634
type it up as they
revise it, illustrate it,

196
00:07:52,634 --> 00:07:55,026
and I found these books.

197
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:57,265
They were at Target in just the

198
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,635
cheap dollar section I think.

199
00:07:58,635 --> 00:07:59,889
I got a bunch of them.

200
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:02,095
They're really smooth
and nice on the front.

201
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,558
They're just these blank books.

202
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,601
It's gonna take several days
for this process to happen,

203
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:08,202
but I'm excited to see the
kid's creativity come out

204
00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:10,803
as they create their own
children's Christmas books.

205
00:08:10,803 --> 00:08:13,357
The kids are researching
all the Christmas books.

206
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:15,029
Is looking at the Christmas books helping?

207
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,306
- Kind of.

208
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:19,951
Just looking at the frame,
it gives me a big idea.

209
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:21,228
- [Kendra] Did it?

210
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:23,016
- And I can only have five ideas.

211
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,804
- [Kendra] You can have
as many ideas as you want,

212
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,499
I said you have to come up
with at least five ideas.

213
00:08:26,499 --> 00:08:27,332
- Oh.

214
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:29,332
- [Kendra] Caleb, do you have an idea?

215
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,354
- Yeah.

216
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:31,375
- [Kendra] What's your idea?

217
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:33,001
- Instruments come to life.

218
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:35,462
They play theirself.

219
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:36,995
- [Kendra] You got an idea too?

220
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,109
- It's my last one.

221
00:08:38,109 --> 00:08:39,990
It's called Santa Spies.

222
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,289
They're trying to find Santa.

223
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:46,050
- [Kendra] The kids are
working on their ideas.

224
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,605
It doesn't happen often,
but when both little girls

225
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:52,622
nap at the same time,
the house is eerily quiet

226
00:08:52,622 --> 00:08:53,806
and I'm crazy productive.

227
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:54,920
We get so much done.

228
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,942
It's awesome.

229
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:58,078
Come is C O M E.

230
00:08:58,078 --> 00:08:58,911
- C O

231
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:00,955
M

232
00:09:02,606 --> 00:09:03,698
E.

233
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:05,160
- [Kendra] Which number
are you working on Lise?

234
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,182
- Two.

235
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:08,156
- [Kendra] So Isaac, you've
got all five of your ideas?

236
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:11,801
- Yeah, I'm thinking of what
Santa's son name would be

237
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,123
if he's something Claus.

238
00:09:14,123 --> 00:09:16,260
You get trained to be Santa.

239
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,885
- [Kendra] Oh, like a family business?

240
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:18,907
- Yeah.

241
00:09:18,907 --> 00:09:20,346
- [Kendra] Let's see it.

242
00:09:20,346 --> 00:09:21,596
That's awesome.

243
00:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,733
Are you trying to come
up with another idea?

244
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,684
Keep looking, look at some more books.

245
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:28,984
Alright, Leesy, do you
have a favorite idea?

246
00:09:28,984 --> 00:09:31,525
- The number two, it's about a
duck going to the North Pole.

247
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:34,149
Since he didn't have a
Christmas tree where he lived,

248
00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:36,959
so he went to the North
Pole and he's a duck.

249
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,004
- [Kendra] And he's a duck.

250
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:39,095
And usually ducks fly south.

251
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,720
- Yeah.

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,696
- [Kendra] So it's gonna be kind of funny.

253
00:09:41,696 --> 00:09:42,671
- Yeah.

254
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:44,157
- [Kendra] Sounds good,
I can't wait to see it.

255
00:09:44,157 --> 00:09:46,595
Alright, Mr. Caleb, do
you have a favorite idea?

256
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:49,172
- Santa changes his job.

257
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,285
- [Kendra] What's Santa
gonna change his job to?

258
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,004
- A cleaner.

259
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,188
- [Kendra] What's he gonna clean?

260
00:09:54,188 --> 00:09:55,465
- Fridges.

261
00:09:55,465 --> 00:09:57,787
- [Kendra] He's gonna clean refrigerators.

262
00:09:57,787 --> 00:10:01,200
- Yes and then they
don't have any scratches.

263
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,406
- [Kendra] Interesting.

264
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:04,939
This is a fun idea.

265
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:07,330
So Caleb, who's gonna deliver
the presents instead of Santa?

266
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,330
- The elves.

267
00:10:09,722 --> 00:10:11,510
- [Kendra] Laura, do
you have any book ideas?

268
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,413
- So Santa had to go to the North Pole

269
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:17,080
since they needed him right now,

270
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:20,914
right, right, right, right now.

271
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:22,702
- [Kendra] Then what
do they do when he gets

272
00:10:22,702 --> 00:10:25,094
to the North Pole 'cause
they needed him right now?

273
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,903
- Then they rided the
sleigh with reindeers.

274
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:30,295
Then they got to the North Pole,

275
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:33,212
then a reindeer was coughing a lot.

276
00:10:34,893 --> 00:10:36,425
- [Kendra] Oh no, what happened
to the coughing reindeer?

277
00:10:36,425 --> 00:10:37,981
- You couldn't use it.

278
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,442
Then the dogs could.

279
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:42,609
The dog sends their magic.

280
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,992
- [Kendra] So then the
magical white dogs helped?

281
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:47,013
- Yeah.

282
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,173
- [Kendra] Wow, great idea.

283
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:51,541
Alright, here's what Laura's handwriting

284
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,422
looks like these days.

285
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,465
Have you ever wanted to
write a book about anything?

286
00:10:55,465 --> 00:10:57,091
Let us know in the comments.

287
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:59,674
(upbeat music)

288
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,792
- [Jeremy] Is that your jacket?

289
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,162
- Yep.

290
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:12,370
Can we have one?

291
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,391
- [Jeremy] You want some ice cream?

292
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:14,413
- Yeah.

293
00:11:14,413 --> 00:11:15,435
- [Jeremy] Sure.

294
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,018
This looks festive.

295
00:11:18,175 --> 00:11:19,870
Candy cane.

296
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,261
So tonight, Caleb's teacher from church

297
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,887
is coming to do dinner with us.

298
00:11:23,887 --> 00:11:26,304
(rock music)

299
00:11:28,925 --> 00:11:33,360
I almost checked out,
but I forgot one thing.

300
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,382
How was shopping?

301
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:35,311
- Good.

302
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,728
(rock music)

303
00:11:47,687 --> 00:11:49,220
- [Jeremy] There you go.

304
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,303
- Very light.

305
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,351
Light.

306
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:56,768
(rock music)

307
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,783
- So I'm making taco
meat and I usually always

308
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,639
use just a taco seasoning packet,

309
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,265
but I've been wanting for a long time

310
00:12:05,265 --> 00:12:06,472
to learn how to do it homemade.

311
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:07,494
So I decided to try today.

312
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,652
It's fun, I've heard it's like
healthier and lower sodium.

313
00:12:10,652 --> 00:12:11,766
We'll see how it turns out.

314
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:13,206
What's something that you would like

315
00:12:13,206 --> 00:12:14,831
to learn how to make homemade?

316
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,526
'Cause taco seasoning was on my list.

317
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:20,450
It looks like taco meat,
it smells like taco meat.

318
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,169
- But does it taste like taco meat?

319
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:24,212
- [Kendra] That is the question.

320
00:12:24,212 --> 00:12:27,370
In other news, Jeremy bought
holiday tortilla chips.

321
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,995
- Kendra's like I don't know if I can eat

322
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,457
tortilla chips that are red and green.

323
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:33,082
- [Kendra] I think it
might mess with my brain.

324
00:12:33,082 --> 00:12:34,104
- They were on sale.

325
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,125
- [Kendra] No, that's awesome.

326
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:36,170
It's very festive of you.

327
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,725
- I wonder if they taste different.

328
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:41,023
- [Jeremy] Merry Chipsmas.

329
00:12:41,023 --> 00:12:42,045
- [Kendra] That's a good question.

330
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:43,067
Merry Chipsmas.

331
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,650
(guitar music)

332
00:12:56,964 --> 00:13:01,155
- [Kendra] Do you like the Christmas tree?

333
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,709
- We finally got all
the other kids to bed.

334
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:04,731
- [Kendra] We think.

335
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:05,564
- We hope.

336
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,932
I just heard Laura.

337
00:13:09,932 --> 00:13:12,324
We're almost there, thanks for watching.

338
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:13,276
- J House out.

339
00:13:13,276 --> 00:13:15,482
- You know in real life I
wouldn't want to eat a camel.

340
00:13:15,482 --> 00:13:17,038
- [Kendra] Definitely not.

341
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:20,520
I'm going to try to do Jenae's
hair for the very first time.

342
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,564
- It's a new wonderland.

343
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:25,141
(screams)

344
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,724
(upbeat music)

345
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,680
- [Jeremy] Good morning

346
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,940
- Good morning.

347
00:13:31,940 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] We have
breakfast ready, come on.
