1
00:00:00,214 --> 00:00:03,082
- And the house looked
like it had blown up.

2
00:00:03,082 --> 00:00:05,089
- [Jeremy] Say goodbye to Granny Jo.

3
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:07,167
- Move your body!

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:09,640
- I'm going to show you something.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,027
- [Kendra] She's dancing.

6
00:00:11,027 --> 00:00:13,787
She's dancing.
(Jeremy laughs)

7
00:00:13,787 --> 00:00:15,444
- Can we tell them where we're going?

8
00:00:15,444 --> 00:00:19,662
We're going to...
(upbeat piano music)

9
00:00:19,662 --> 00:00:20,495
- Good morning.

10
00:00:20,495 --> 00:00:21,502
Today is a big day around here

11
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:23,949
because we are packing for our trip.

12
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:24,822
And we're starting off the day

13
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:25,828
with a really yummy breakfast.

14
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:27,045
At least I think it's yummy.

15
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:28,845
Some of my kids aren't so sure about it,

16
00:00:28,845 --> 00:00:31,695
but we are having quiche and smoothies.

17
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:34,362
(relaxed music)

18
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,789
- [Jeremy] How do you
like the quiche, Elise?

19
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:38,622
- Good.

20
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:40,010
- [Jeremy] Laura, what do
you think of the quiche?

21
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:40,908
- I like it.

22
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,928
I'm cutting it into pieces.

23
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,048
- [Jeremy] Say goodbye to Granny Jo.

24
00:00:45,048 --> 00:00:47,503
- I will see you in a couple
of weeks, which is so fun.

25
00:00:47,503 --> 00:00:48,492
I look forward to it.

26
00:00:48,492 --> 00:00:50,743
We'll come and play
with you in a few days.

27
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:51,776
(record scratches)

28
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:55,888
- Sometimes as a mom, I feel
like I am trying to move

29
00:00:55,888 --> 00:01:00,055
an army of concrete ants

30
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:05,445
up a waterfall in the desert.

31
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:08,073
That didn't really make any sense,

32
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:11,285
but sometimes as a mom, I
feel like I'm like, "Come on!

33
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,597
"Let's do it!

34
00:01:13,597 --> 00:01:15,620
"Move your body!

35
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,653
"Do your chores!"

36
00:01:17,653 --> 00:01:18,486
- Do it.

37
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,908
Do your chores.
(Kendra chuckles)

38
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:23,116
Can we tell them where we're going?

39
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:24,130
- Do you want to?

40
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:24,963
- Yeah.

41
00:01:24,963 --> 00:01:26,496
- Or do you think they're ready for that?

42
00:01:26,496 --> 00:01:30,042
- We are going to San Diego for a month.

43
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:30,906
- I'm so excited.

44
00:01:30,906 --> 00:01:32,255
I keep texting Jeremy pictures

45
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:34,306
of the weather forecast in San Diego.

46
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:35,457
- It's true, she does.

47
00:01:35,457 --> 00:01:37,401
- Because it's like gorgeous.

48
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:38,538
It's like there's sun.
- But the list of people

49
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:41,076
we're gonna see, the
things we're gonna do,

50
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:42,949
we're all really excited.

51
00:01:42,949 --> 00:01:46,293
- I am too because it's a lot warmer.

52
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:47,350
- [Jeremy] It is.

53
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,686
- [Kendra] Ooh, what are
we gonna do in San Diego?

54
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:51,135
- Go to the beach.

55
00:01:51,135 --> 00:01:52,222
- [Kendra] The beach is gonna be cold.

56
00:01:52,222 --> 00:01:54,281
Like the water's cold.

57
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,738
- But it will be nice.

58
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,493
- [Kendra] The sand and
playing outside the park

59
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,041
is gonna be nice, but the actual water

60
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,038
is gonna still be cold.

61
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:02,211
It's still winter in San Diego.

62
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:05,090
- I'm gonna swim in San Diego.

63
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:07,484
- I say we let him have at it.

64
00:02:07,484 --> 00:02:08,689
That will be fun to see.

65
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,902
- [Kendra] We might let
you swim in a heated pool.

66
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:11,736
(Caleb gasps)

67
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:14,010
- I got real makeup for Christmas.

68
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,438
- [Kendra] You got real
makeup for Christmas?

69
00:02:15,438 --> 00:02:16,271
- Yeah.

70
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:17,678
- [Kendra] We've seen you
use it a couple of times.

71
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:18,511
- I know.

72
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,344
- [Kendra] Are you liking it?

73
00:02:19,344 --> 00:02:20,177
- Yeah.

74
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:21,781
- [Kendra] How do you
feel about San Diego?

75
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:22,959
- Good.

76
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,838
- [Kendra] What are we
gonna do in San Diego?

77
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:26,018
- Ice cream.

78
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:27,847
- [Kendra] We're gonna eat
ice cream in San Diego?

79
00:02:27,847 --> 00:02:28,680
- Yeah.

80
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,107
- [Kendra] Whose birthday is it gonna be

81
00:02:30,107 --> 00:02:31,292
when we're in San Diego?

82
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:32,328
- Me and Lisey's.

83
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:35,674
- [Kendra] (gasps) How
old are you gonna turn?

84
00:02:35,674 --> 00:02:36,735
Four!

85
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:39,542
So what are you most
excited to do in San Diego?

86
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:42,205
- Go to LegoLand and go to the beach.

87
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,038
- Well, we actually just had

88
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,580
a really successful family meeting.

89
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,991
I gave the kids all lists of specifically

90
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:48,376
what they need to be getting done.

91
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,465
And now, it's working.

92
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:51,354
Like we talked about
how we need to be a team

93
00:02:51,354 --> 00:02:53,152
and be working together
and how it's a lot of work

94
00:02:53,152 --> 00:02:54,379
to get ready for a trip.

95
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,933
And anyway, we even did like
a family cheer at the end,

96
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:59,605
like, "One, two, three, go, San Diego!"

97
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:01,971
So I'm feeling a little
bit of a weight lifted,

98
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:04,665
and I am going to help the girls.

99
00:03:04,665 --> 00:03:05,987
We're gonna try to get them packed.

100
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:07,903
Is this something you're gonna pack?

101
00:03:07,903 --> 00:03:08,736
- Yup.

102
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,692
- [Kendra] Show us what you're packing.

103
00:03:09,692 --> 00:03:11,122
All of that.

104
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:13,864
Okay, we have underwear, pajamas, clothes,

105
00:03:13,864 --> 00:03:16,479
shorts, dresses to wear to church.

106
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:18,189
- [Elise] Wow, she's way fast at packing.

107
00:03:18,189 --> 00:03:19,999
- [Kendra] I might have been
helping her a little bit.

108
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:20,832
(Elise chuckles)

109
00:03:20,832 --> 00:03:22,555
We're bringing the jelly shoes.

110
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:25,623
Laura, go find your jellies.

111
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,422
That's why we need to look for them.

112
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,255
- No.

113
00:03:29,197 --> 00:03:30,529
- So I had Laura try on this dress

114
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:32,364
and see if it fit before we take it.

115
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:33,723
And now she doesn't wanna take it off.

116
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,137
She just keeps dancing in it.

117
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:38,952
I think she feels like a pretty cool cat.

118
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,618
You're not gonna wear that
shirt when you travel?

119
00:03:40,618 --> 00:03:43,891
- I wore it today just to
not wear it at the airport.

120
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,033
It's an ongoing tradition

121
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,487
that people have
mentioned in the comments.

122
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,341
So I'm gonna end it off.

123
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,403
- [Kendra] Breaking tradition?

124
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,236
- Yup.

125
00:03:50,236 --> 00:03:51,113
- [Kendra] So what did you just find out?

126
00:03:51,113 --> 00:03:52,625
- We can do laundry.

127
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,552
- [Kendra] Yeah.

128
00:03:53,552 --> 00:03:57,951
- So if we ran out of clothes,
we can just do laundry.

129
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:58,784
- [Kendra] That's exactly right.

130
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:00,832
- That's my whole packing problem.

131
00:04:00,832 --> 00:04:02,180
- So Elise and I were struggling.

132
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,729
I'm like, "You do not
need this many shirts."

133
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,949
And she's like, "I do!"

134
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,523
And anyway, finally, we
realized she didn't know

135
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:09,475
that we could do laundry
when we were there.

136
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:11,588
So that should help with packing.

137
00:04:11,588 --> 00:04:15,755
- So today,

138
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,691
I'm going to show you something.

139
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,230
So today, I love my mom.

140
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,546
(Kendra chuckles)

141
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:28,351
Here's Nae-nae and mom.

142
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,184
- She just woke up.

143
00:04:29,184 --> 00:04:30,017
Say hi.

144
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:31,771
- [Jeremy] Are you playing Osmo?

145
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,604
- Mm-hmm.

146
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:36,707
- [Jeremy] So you're
piecing together a coding.

147
00:04:36,707 --> 00:04:38,136
Let's see how it goes.

148
00:04:38,136 --> 00:04:39,980
- [Laura] It goes like this.

149
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,041
- [Jeremy] Laura is in her fourth

150
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:44,821
or fifth outfit of the day, of course.

151
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,065
And what did we make?

152
00:04:46,065 --> 00:04:47,674
- A doggie (mumbles).

153
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:48,834
- [Jeremy] A doggie.

154
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,509
What should we call our doggie?

155
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:52,425
- Fridge donkey.

156
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:53,641
- [Jeremy] The fridge donkey?

157
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:54,474
- [Laura] Yeah.

158
00:04:54,474 --> 00:04:55,435
- [Jeremy] Interesting name.

159
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:56,431
You ride it?

160
00:04:56,431 --> 00:04:57,548
Go ahead.

161
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,881
She rides the fridge donkey.

162
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:04,746
Oh, no! (laughs)

163
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:06,157
You crushed him.

164
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:07,709
- Now we have to make it again.

165
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,982
It's all tangled.

166
00:05:08,982 --> 00:05:09,815
- [Jeremy] Okay, here.

167
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:10,648
I'll make it again.

168
00:05:10,648 --> 00:05:11,481
Hold on.

169
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:14,314
(whimsical music)

170
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:17,273
- J House, out.

171
00:05:17,273 --> 00:05:19,473
I'm vlogging you.

172
00:05:19,473 --> 00:05:20,306
- You're vlogging me?

173
00:05:20,306 --> 00:05:21,139
- [Laura] Yeah.

174
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:25,210
- All right, I think the dog is done.

175
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,464
- I guess we'll have to
make it again, right?

176
00:05:28,464 --> 00:05:29,584
I can turn it off.

177
00:05:29,584 --> 00:05:31,974
- [Jeremy] Okay, you turn it off.

178
00:05:31,974 --> 00:05:33,469
What are you making?

179
00:05:33,469 --> 00:05:37,252
- We are making corn muffins.

180
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:39,105
- [Jeremy] For dinner?

181
00:05:39,105 --> 00:05:39,938
Just for fun?

182
00:05:39,938 --> 00:05:40,771
- Snack.

183
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:41,604
- [Jeremy] Yummy.

184
00:05:41,604 --> 00:05:42,595
- [Elise] And let's see.

185
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:45,141
- [Laura] Teaspoons, please.

186
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:48,533
(blows a raspberry.

187
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:51,033
- And then we'll need one egg.

188
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,183
Thank you.

189
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:28,446
(Jeremy laughs)

190
00:06:28,446 --> 00:06:30,282
- [Jeremy] Great singing, Laura.

191
00:06:30,282 --> 00:06:32,873
Elise's muffins are done.

192
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:34,062
How did they turn out?

193
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,158
- Good.

194
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:36,139
- [Jeremy] Thanks so much, Elise.

195
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,457
- I tried to make them not overdone

196
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:41,738
or less overdone.

197
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,628
- Well, the kids are getting restless.

198
00:06:43,628 --> 00:06:44,554
I'm getting overwhelmed.

199
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:48,102
And the house looked like it has blown up.

200
00:06:48,102 --> 00:06:50,315
The mess that comes from
eating corn muffins.

201
00:06:50,315 --> 00:06:53,648
(whimsical piano music)

202
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,470
Everything is out.

203
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,945
There's messes everywhere.

204
00:06:57,945 --> 00:07:00,672
And it's time to take a deep
breath and go eat dinner.

205
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:03,255
(upbeat music)

206
00:07:06,102 --> 00:07:07,794
So we came to McAlister's Deli.

207
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:11,653
They have kid's meals that are
99 cents, which is awesome.

208
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:13,108
Lisey, what did you order?

209
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:14,769
- I ordered a salad.

210
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:15,630
- [Kendra] What did you order?

211
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,044
- Turkey sandwich.

212
00:07:17,044 --> 00:07:17,897
- [Kendra] With what?

213
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:18,886
- Cheese.

214
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,005
- [Jeremy] And chips.

215
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:20,838
- [Kendra] And chips.

216
00:07:20,838 --> 00:07:21,680
What did you order?

217
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,774
- Mac and cheese with a fruit cup.

218
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:25,107
- [Kendra] Nice.

219
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,701
She was really excited about the water.

220
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:35,534
- [Jeremy] She can't
totally control her face.

221
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:37,881
Pretty good.

222
00:07:37,881 --> 00:07:39,964
- [Kendra] She's dancing.

223
00:07:41,655 --> 00:07:43,238
- [Jeremy] What's that?

224
00:07:43,238 --> 00:07:44,920
What's that move?

225
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
- It's a hootie move.

226
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,501
- [Jeremy] A hootie move?

227
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,336
- [Kendra] Oh, look, she's dancing.

228
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,112
She's dancing.
(Jeremy laughs)

229
00:07:52,112 --> 00:07:54,862
- [Waitress] Macaroni and cheese.

230
00:07:57,568 --> 00:07:58,506
(Jeremy laughs)

231
00:07:58,506 --> 00:07:59,339
- Thank you.

232
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,172
You know our family too well.

233
00:08:00,172 --> 00:08:01,196
(waitress chuckles)

234
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:02,029
- [Jeremy] We need extra napkins.

235
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,862
- Mom, I got a snack!

236
00:08:02,862 --> 00:08:03,778
- You got a snack?

237
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,812
So Jeremy's sandwich is
called the Big Nasty.

238
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:09,751
but this is a Parmesan kale soup.

239
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,867
This is our first time
trying to kid's meals here,

240
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:13,416
and I am really happy with them.

241
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:17,170
They're good portions, a
good selection, and 99 cents.

242
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,112
This is not sponsored.

243
00:08:18,112 --> 00:08:18,987
I'm just thrilled.

244
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:21,127
(upbeat music)

245
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:22,489
- [Caleb] Good night.

246
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:23,649
J House, out.

247
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,058
- Some of our pipes are frozen.

248
00:08:26,058 --> 00:08:29,000
- [Jeremy] Get him! (laughs)

249
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,344
- [Kendra] Laura is
getting ready for the day.

250
00:08:30,344 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat rock music)
