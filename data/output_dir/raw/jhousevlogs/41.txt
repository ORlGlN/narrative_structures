1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,243
- [Kendra] Who puts ice cream on a burger?

2
00:00:02,243 --> 00:00:03,865
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:03,865 --> 00:00:05,261
- So we have something
important we want to

4
00:00:05,261 --> 00:00:06,968
talk about with you guys today.

5
00:00:06,968 --> 00:00:11,782
When we compare ourselves to
others, it brings sadness.

6
00:00:11,782 --> 00:00:14,580
Check out this s'mores milkshake!

7
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:17,163
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:23,034
(flamenco guitar music)

9
00:00:25,036 --> 00:00:27,715
- [Jeremy] How did you
sleep last night big girl?

10
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:29,813
- Good, I didn't sleep in this.

11
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:31,467
- [Jeremy] No, you slept in your bed huh?

12
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:32,299
- Yeah.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,200
- [Jeremy] But you wish you
could sleep in this every night?

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,275
- Yeah.

15
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:38,608
(flamenco guitar music)

16
00:00:41,303 --> 00:00:42,636
- Keep you warm.

17
00:00:44,485 --> 00:00:46,735
(laughter)

18
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:49,937
- Good girl!

19
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:51,205
- [Jeremy] Well, I'm out of here!

20
00:00:51,205 --> 00:00:52,789
- So we have something
important we wanted to

21
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:56,504
talk about with you guys
today, and that is... reality.

22
00:00:56,504 --> 00:00:58,607
We've heard kind of a
buzz going around about

23
00:00:58,607 --> 00:01:01,875
what is real and what is not
in the social media world,

24
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,756
and we just wanted to share some of

25
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:05,215
our thoughts on this topic.

26
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:07,249
- We talk about this a lot together...

27
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:08,082
- Oh for sure.

28
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:10,644
- And we're very deliberate
about what we share in the vlog,

29
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,792
and that's also what we
want to talk about is

30
00:01:12,792 --> 00:01:14,977
what it is we are sharing,
and what we're not.

31
00:01:14,977 --> 00:01:17,567
- So I guess what's really
important to me is you all know

32
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:21,284
that we are not trying
to display the ideal.

33
00:01:21,284 --> 00:01:24,848
We're not trying to display
perfection by any means.

34
00:01:24,848 --> 00:01:27,153
We've tried to share that Jeremy and I

35
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,238
have gone through marriage counseling,

36
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,256
that we're having behavior
issues with our kids.

37
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:32,615
That I struggle with
depression and anxiety.

38
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:34,224
I'm really struggling more with

39
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,564
anxiety and depression lately.

40
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:39,065
We wanted to tell you about
our first year of marriage,

41
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,053
which was actually really crappy.

42
00:01:41,053 --> 00:01:42,788
- Does marriage just not go well,

43
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:45,271
or am I just so messed up that I can't

44
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:46,757
love the way that I need to love,

45
00:01:46,757 --> 00:01:48,484
or I can't be what I need to be.

46
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:49,635
- You don't see my whole day,

47
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:51,097
you just see these little pieces,

48
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:54,315
and I feel like I'm really
truly failing as a mother.

49
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:56,793
I just want to reset, start over,

50
00:01:56,793 --> 00:02:00,255
or just go to bed now, wake up
tomorrow, and try again then.

51
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:02,046
- I think it's overwhelming
as parents because

52
00:02:02,046 --> 00:02:03,916
we often feel like...

53
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,797
- We have no idea what we're doing?

54
00:02:05,797 --> 00:02:08,145
- Yeah we don't know what to
do, we don't know how to help,

55
00:02:08,145 --> 00:02:10,135
each kid has a unique different challenge

56
00:02:10,136 --> 00:02:12,053
and we feel inadequate.

57
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,785
- So I'm having a down day,

58
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,710
a day when I'm struggling with depression,

59
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,773
and those down feelings, those
feelings that I'm not enough.

60
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:21,652
I also struggle after each baby

61
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:23,235
with some postpartum depression.

62
00:02:23,235 --> 00:02:25,143
We decided to have me do some counseling

63
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,915
before this baby is born.

64
00:02:26,915 --> 00:02:28,548
- I've been really
stressing about finances,

65
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,775
we just ended another quarter.

66
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,052
It's hard to not have as much money

67
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:34,175
as you thought you were going to have,

68
00:02:34,175 --> 00:02:37,648
and all the worries that come
with that, and the anxiety.

69
00:02:37,648 --> 00:02:40,446
- Well this morning Jeremy and
I got in quite an argument.

70
00:02:40,446 --> 00:02:41,734
We got mad.

71
00:02:41,734 --> 00:02:45,099
I so desperately want to be
this amazing mother to my kids.

72
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,032
I get that you guys see the
good that happens in our world,

73
00:02:48,032 --> 00:02:50,416
but there's a lot of moments
that don't get filmed,

74
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:53,138
or get edited in of me
snapping at the kids,

75
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:55,135
or my house is a complete wreck,

76
00:02:55,135 --> 00:02:56,788
or I'm in my pajamas all day,

77
00:02:56,788 --> 00:02:59,280
or I'm just grumpy and irritable,

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,078
or I'm on my phone too much that day,

79
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,887
or I'm distracted and
not focused on the kids,

80
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:09,537
or I just yell, or I'm just
impatient and get so angry.

81
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:12,731
Marriage in real life, is hard.

82
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,916
It's beautiful, but it also
kind of sucks sometimes.

83
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:18,941
But we're also trying to
be respectful to our family

84
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:21,308
in the way that we share those things.

85
00:03:21,308 --> 00:03:24,671
We don't want to share our
kids really rough moments,

86
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,219
when they're learning, and growing,

87
00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:27,538
and going through phases,

88
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:29,818
and the internet is going to stay forever!

89
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:31,066
We also want to be respectful of things

90
00:03:31,066 --> 00:03:33,085
that need to stay private in our marriage,

91
00:03:33,085 --> 00:03:35,451
so we can have the strength
to work through them.

92
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:37,285
Jeremy and I have also learned

93
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:40,472
through this YouTube adventure
that it feels better,

94
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:41,805
to share good...

95
00:03:43,278 --> 00:03:45,582
We don't want to be whiny and complaining,

96
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,507
and spreading negativity,

97
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:51,143
we want to be reminding
ourselves and each of you

98
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:54,094
of the good that exists
in our flawed lives.

99
00:03:54,094 --> 00:03:56,667
We don't want to remember
the terrible moments.

100
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,439
Jeremy and I often talk
about how someday we're

101
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,067
going to be sitting in an old folks home,

102
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:01,813
watching our vlogs on repeat.

103
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:04,233
- And forgetting about
all the terrible things,

104
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:05,108
this is great!

105
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:06,852
- Jeremy said the most
ironic thing the other day.

106
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:08,976
He watched one of our vlogs, and he said,

107
00:04:08,976 --> 00:04:10,727
we were talking about this
comparison game, and he said,

108
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:13,026
"My life, isn't as good as our vlogs."

109
00:04:13,026 --> 00:04:14,861
- Like we watched the Lego Land vlog.

110
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:17,148
It was more fun to watch the Lego Land one

111
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:18,190
than to go through it.

112
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,286
I mean we shared in the Lego
Land vlog that one of our kids

113
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,309
threw this mammoth tantrum,
and that really put a damper

114
00:04:23,309 --> 00:04:25,722
on the day for me, that was really hard.

115
00:04:25,722 --> 00:04:28,050
- We've had a great
day at Lego Land today,

116
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,804
and we also had a really rough moment.

117
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:33,216
One of our kids threw quite the tantrum,

118
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:37,364
and honestly I was super
embarrassed, but it happens.

119
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:39,047
- And we talked about it in the vlog,

120
00:04:39,047 --> 00:04:41,566
but you can't experience
it, so like the vlog itself

121
00:04:41,566 --> 00:04:43,851
was so fun to watch and so awesome,

122
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:47,208
but it skips all waiting in
line, it skips all tantrums,

123
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:49,240
it skips all disobedience,
it skips everything.

124
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,562
- It skips all the decision making.

125
00:04:51,562 --> 00:04:53,916
Like oh where should we go
next, looking at the map.

126
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:57,237
- It just includes fun moments to music,

127
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:02,036
so the Lego Land video was more
fun than going to Lego Land.

128
00:05:02,036 --> 00:05:05,143
- I love being a mother,
and there's days that

129
00:05:05,143 --> 00:05:08,159
I want to pull every hair on my head out.

130
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,099
And it's hard to have five little kids,

131
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,180
and to home school, and
have Jeremy work from home.

132
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,025
We are always in each others space,

133
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,116
and that doesn't always go really well.

134
00:05:18,116 --> 00:05:19,919
It's hard to have different
opinions and Jeremy and I

135
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,707
are both super opinionated,
and super stubborn.

136
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:24,526
- Speak for yourself, I
don't think that's true.

137
00:05:24,526 --> 00:05:25,517
(laughter)

138
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,343
So another thing besides
people comparing...

139
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:28,426
- I love you!

140
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,438
- Did she just say I love you?

141
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,929
- I love you!

142
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:36,143
- Did she just say I love you?

143
00:05:36,143 --> 00:05:37,026
- Or "I poop".

144
00:05:37,026 --> 00:05:37,859
- Hello!

145
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,284
- Hello!

146
00:05:39,284 --> 00:05:42,172
- So the other thing I'm nervous about

147
00:05:42,172 --> 00:05:45,375
for our younger viewers who watch,

148
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:48,417
saying that they want to
have a family like ours.

149
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:50,936
We want to be inspiring
but we don't want to create

150
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:54,561
false expectations of what a
family is, or what it's like.

151
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:57,098
- And we do love having
the family that we have,

152
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:59,149
but we just wouldn't
want people to grow up,

153
00:05:59,149 --> 00:06:01,698
have their own five kids,
and be like "wait a minute."

154
00:06:01,698 --> 00:06:04,826
- "My husband is not like
Jeremy who never lost his temper

155
00:06:04,826 --> 00:06:06,978
and was always good humored and kind."

156
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:08,481
- Or "how did Kendra stay patient

157
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,811
through all these moments?"
Spoiler alert... didn't.

158
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,214
- Nothing has made me happier
than seeing people comments

159
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:16,830
that they just came home
from a hard day of school,

160
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,172
or they're home sick,

161
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:20,338
and the videos brought
a smile to their face.

162
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,590
That makes me so happy, we're providing

163
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,532
a form of entertainment
that brings people joy,

164
00:06:25,532 --> 00:06:27,996
or inspires them to want
to go out an do something

165
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:29,958
with their family, I
love those pieces of it.

166
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:32,487
- By sharing the good parts of our day,

167
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:34,819
but just because we're sharing
the good parts of our day,

168
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,608
which are completely real,

169
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:38,255
we don't want you to
assume that there's not

170
00:06:38,255 --> 00:06:40,710
the hard and bad parts of our day,

171
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:43,183
because those are completely real as well.

172
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:46,220
Wherever you are in
your own imperfect life,

173
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:49,351
in your own imperfect
family, you're not alone.

174
00:06:49,351 --> 00:06:51,201
That's what all of us are going through,

175
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,859
we're all just doing our
best and trying our best,

176
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:56,060
and you have beautiful
moments of your life,

177
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,239
and you have really
annoying parts of your life,

178
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,678
and so do we.

179
00:06:59,678 --> 00:07:02,439
We just wanted to remind all of us,

180
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,356
Jeremy and I need this reminder too,

181
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:06,542
of social media and where is stands.

182
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,728
It's the pieces that people want to share.

183
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:11,258
- And it's interesting because
we have a responsibility

184
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:15,153
for ourselves, to not be
comparing or feeling lesser

185
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:16,621
when we see the great things.

186
00:07:16,621 --> 00:07:18,131
I mean just the other day,
one of your good friends

187
00:07:18,131 --> 00:07:19,869
posted something that
she was doing as a mom,

188
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,060
and you were kind of feeling like...

189
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,529
- I'm the worst mom ever!

190
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,951
- But it like Kendra,
we know those people,

191
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:30,080
we know that they also
have really rough times,

192
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,285
and it is a responsibility
on the participant,

193
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,049
on the viewer of social media to try to

194
00:07:34,049 --> 00:07:35,219
put those things in perspective,

195
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,198
because otherwise it
can lead to depression,

196
00:07:37,198 --> 00:07:39,870
anxiety, and feeling lesser as a person.

197
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,300
- Now, we're going to go back to our

198
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,011
regularly scheduled programming.

199
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:46,429
(orchestral music)

200
00:07:46,429 --> 00:07:49,157
- So this morning Jeremy
and I were talking about,

201
00:07:49,157 --> 00:07:51,050
you know not comparing ourselves to people

202
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,748
that we see on social
media, whether it's on

203
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:55,081
Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, whatever.

204
00:07:55,081 --> 00:07:58,276
But we didn't talk about
why... and here's why.

205
00:07:58,276 --> 00:08:01,084
When we compare ourselves to others,

206
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:03,999
it brings sadness into our lives,

207
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:08,550
because we fail to see the
goodness that's in our own lives.

208
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,491
Comparison is the opposite of gratitude.

209
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,222
Comparison is like an entitlement.

210
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:14,655
It's like "man, they
have this and I don't,

211
00:08:14,655 --> 00:08:16,558
that stinks I should have it."

212
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:18,926
It just robs us of our joy.

213
00:08:18,926 --> 00:08:23,406
So here's my challenge for all
of us today, myself included.

214
00:08:23,406 --> 00:08:26,583
I want us to think of five
things that we're grateful for.

215
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,885
Five unique things about your life.

216
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:31,587
Ways that you are truly blessed,

217
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,655
and as we stop and pause
on those gratitudes,

218
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:39,124
it helps us feel joy, and
then we can share joy,

219
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:43,379
and just recognize how
blessed our lives are.

220
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,796
(jazz music)

221
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,887
- We're headed somewhere
fun for dinner tonight.

222
00:08:49,887 --> 00:08:52,578
I actually read about it
online before we came.

223
00:08:52,578 --> 00:08:55,484
And it's a burger place
called Slater's 50/50,

224
00:08:55,484 --> 00:08:57,256
but they have a very unique burger that

225
00:08:57,256 --> 00:08:59,884
at least one of us will
be brave enough to try.

226
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,531
- No.

227
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,907
- I'm going to try it.

228
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:03,978
- [Kendra] You're going to try it?

229
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:07,978
- It has ice cream, and
peanut butter, and buns.

230
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:11,295
(laughter)

231
00:09:11,295 --> 00:09:14,263
- [Kendra] We knew the hamburger
was going to have buns.

232
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,415
(jazz music)

233
00:09:17,415 --> 00:09:19,952
- [Kendra] So I keep
videoing all our pretty views

234
00:09:19,952 --> 00:09:23,668
while we're driving, and
this is driving me crazy.

235
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:27,159
We got pooped on! Need to
go wash our windshield.

236
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,576
(jazz music)

237
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:33,726
I feel like every time
we go into a restaurant

238
00:09:33,726 --> 00:09:35,536
with all our our kids, I
kind of brace myself...

239
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:38,058
like please please behave, please!

240
00:09:38,058 --> 00:09:41,415
- [Kendra] Check out this burger!

241
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:44,498
(upbeat piano music)

242
00:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,422
- Parenting pro tip, when you have six...

243
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:58,042
we don't have six kids.

244
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:01,939
- When you have five kids,
and everyone is inside eating,

245
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:03,918
and there's an option for outside,

246
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,206
we can't bother anyone out here so,

247
00:10:06,206 --> 00:10:08,325
and they brought little heaters for us.

248
00:10:08,325 --> 00:10:10,577
- It's nice and quiet, it's
warm, it was a good idea Jeremy.

249
00:10:10,577 --> 00:10:12,996
So look at this they have
this amazing milkshake,

250
00:10:12,996 --> 00:10:16,001
which reminds me of the place
that we went in St. Louis?

251
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,503
- [Jeremy] Fitz's.

252
00:10:17,503 --> 00:10:19,435
- And the place we went in DC,

253
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:23,336
which had a marshmallow
milkshake, so this is mine.

254
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:24,598
- [Jeremy] Do you guys
remember what happened

255
00:10:24,598 --> 00:10:26,122
when we were trying to go to Fitz's?

256
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:28,039
- Yeah, we were soaked.

257
00:10:29,471 --> 00:10:31,001
(raindrops hitting pavement)

258
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:32,161
- Completely wet!

259
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,375
(laughter)

260
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,458
- [Jeremy] No, this is the wrong way!

261
00:10:39,292 --> 00:10:40,781
- That was awesome!

262
00:10:40,781 --> 00:10:43,472
- Was that fun? This
place better be amazing.

263
00:10:43,472 --> 00:10:44,947
- [Kendra] So we ordered an appetizer,

264
00:10:44,947 --> 00:10:46,808
do you want to tell them what it is?

265
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:51,031
- It's a mac and cheese roll
with cheese on top of it.

266
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,758
- So this place is known for their

267
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:55,061
fried bacon mac and cheese balls,

268
00:10:55,061 --> 00:10:56,976
so we're going to try
that as an appetizer.

269
00:10:56,976 --> 00:10:57,885
- I love it!

270
00:10:57,885 --> 00:10:58,876
- So good!

271
00:10:58,876 --> 00:11:01,293
(funk music)

272
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,931
- [Kendra] Salad.

273
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,296
(harp strumming)

274
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:09,313
- [Jeremy] Okay, who wants to try some?

275
00:11:09,313 --> 00:11:13,410
- [Kendra] So this burger,
has a burger, and bacon,

276
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:17,811
and strawberry jelly, and
peanut butter, and ice cream.

277
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,560
- Can we try it?

278
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,002
- [Kendra] Does everybody
want to taste it?

279
00:11:22,002 --> 00:11:24,431
- Laura's like "whatever."

280
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:26,814
- [Kendra] Who puts ice cream on a burger?

281
00:11:26,814 --> 00:11:29,231
(funk music)

282
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:32,986
- That's really good.

283
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:34,486
- [Kendra] No way.

284
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:37,495
- [Kendra] It's so big it's hard for them

285
00:11:37,495 --> 00:11:39,122
to get their mouths around.

286
00:11:39,122 --> 00:11:40,789
- Mmmm, that's good!

287
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:47,049
- [Kendra] Mac and cheese,
french fries, she's in heaven.

288
00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:48,600
Alright poll question.

289
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,880
Do you like bacon, because
I know this is terrible,

290
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,553
but I don't, I don't actually love bacon.

291
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:57,659
I'm liking my food here, but a bacon

292
00:11:57,659 --> 00:12:00,735
restaurant is kind of wasted on me.

293
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:03,666
- [Kendra] Elise is
currently feeding Janae.

294
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:04,999
What's up there?

295
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:08,288
She's been seeing the airplanes,

296
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:10,087
she's like "what's going on?"

297
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:11,850
- So this is my third time to go to the

298
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:14,360
bathroom with kids during the meal.

299
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,765
I changed a diaper,

300
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,793
which they had a diaper
changer in the bathroom.

301
00:12:17,793 --> 00:12:19,642
It's on the other side buddy.

302
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:21,676
I've taken Laura to the bathroom twice,

303
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:24,421
and now Caleb and Isaac. Okay let's go!

304
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:28,421
- Alright guys check out
this s'mores milkshake.

305
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,311
Marshmallow milkshake.

306
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:35,061
(feelgood music)

307
00:12:36,162 --> 00:12:38,230
So this other dessert
is called the Coco Karma

308
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,018
and it's supposed to be like
the Samoa Girl Scout Cookie.

309
00:12:41,018 --> 00:12:42,435
- It's delicious.

310
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,275
- In total it was seven
trips to the bathroom,

311
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:48,849
during the meal, that's
more than normal though,

312
00:12:48,849 --> 00:12:50,414
that was weird.

313
00:12:50,414 --> 00:12:52,492
(echoy signing)

314
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:55,159
(running water)

315
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,062
- Good night, J-House out!

316
00:12:58,062 --> 00:12:59,811
- What do you think the moon feels like?

317
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:02,092
Ready to head to the ocean side?

318
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:05,009
(orchestral music)

319
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:11,204
(cheering)

320
00:13:11,204 --> 00:00:00,000
- So what do you think,
was that a first step?
