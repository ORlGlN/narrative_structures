1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
- So Elise has a pretty loose tooth.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,650
(laughing)

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,037
(growling)

4
00:00:08,037 --> 00:00:10,120
(laughs)

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,419
- I'm just doing my squats.

6
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,192
- So, as soon as Caleb woke up,

7
00:00:21,192 --> 00:00:24,512
he wanted to start playing
with his new Lego set.

8
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:25,800
- It's fun.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,776
- You're doing a good job, bud.

10
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,688
I love that that you can do this

11
00:00:27,688 --> 00:00:29,120
without any help from me.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,703
- Mmhmm. They got the
perfect level for me.

13
00:00:33,623 --> 00:00:35,161
- Wait, Laura, let's see your outfit.

14
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,097
This was a present, right?

15
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,105
- I'm going to wear it today.

16
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,438
Even for school!

17
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:42,164
(cheery music playing)

18
00:00:42,164 --> 00:00:46,147
- Those socks really
add to the outfit too.

19
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:49,064
(rock music plays)

20
00:00:50,339 --> 00:00:51,827
It looks like you finished it.

21
00:00:51,827 --> 00:00:52,660
- I did!

22
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:00,109
(blender whirs)

23
00:01:02,384 --> 00:01:03,344
- Good morning.

24
00:01:03,344 --> 00:01:06,000
We had a slow moving morning this morning.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,584
I think just coming off the
birthday party yesterday,

26
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,600
we're all kind of dragging our feet.

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,833
It was a bit much for me so

28
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,761
we're recovering this morning.

29
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,376
The kids are playing with
their toys and doing chores

30
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:19,793
and getting going on our day.

31
00:01:23,694 --> 00:01:25,566
These two both got different Play-Doh sets

32
00:01:25,566 --> 00:01:26,686
at their birthday party yesterday.

33
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,103
Caleb's does this

34
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,782
and Laura's does this.

35
00:01:31,782 --> 00:01:33,198
Let's see if we can figure it out.

36
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:34,031
- Oh, maybe right there.

37
00:01:34,031 --> 00:01:35,190
- I think you're right.

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,387
Caleb, it looks like this piece

39
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,197
goes in the front here somehow.

40
00:01:39,197 --> 00:01:41,448
So you choose what shape
you want it to squeeze out.

41
00:01:41,448 --> 00:01:44,248
- I'm going to make it these strings.

42
00:01:44,248 --> 00:01:47,470
(cheery music plays)

43
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,576
(tapping)

44
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:50,918
- You've got some strings!

45
00:01:50,918 --> 00:01:51,837
Did it work?

46
00:01:51,837 --> 00:01:52,670
- Yeah.

47
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,503
- That looks awesome.

48
00:01:53,503 --> 00:01:54,336
- I'm going to smush it back up

49
00:01:54,336 --> 00:01:55,994
so that I can do more.

50
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:59,077
(cheery music plays)

51
00:02:00,648 --> 00:02:01,873
- Wow! What's up there?

52
00:02:01,873 --> 00:02:03,233
Are you looking for some birds?

53
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:04,763
Tweet tweet.

54
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:06,353
- (roars)

55
00:02:06,353 --> 00:02:07,385
- (laughs)

56
00:02:07,385 --> 00:02:09,041
- Alright, so I'm going
to be the moving target.

57
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:11,202
Each kid gets four balls and two shots

58
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:14,375
with the dart gun to try to hit me.

59
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,053
We're going to see who
can get me the most.

60
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,303
(old-time music plays)

61
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:22,477
(pop)

62
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:25,316
(laughs)

63
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:26,449
(pop)

64
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:27,569
Ah!

65
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:30,273
- (laughs) Got you!

66
00:02:30,273 --> 00:02:32,523
(laughing)

67
00:02:33,482 --> 00:02:36,801
(old time music playing)

68
00:02:36,801 --> 00:02:37,705
(pop)

69
00:02:37,705 --> 00:02:40,418
(laughs)

70
00:02:40,418 --> 00:02:43,001
- No Caleb, you're not winning!

71
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:46,436
(laughing)

72
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:53,181
(suspenseful music plays)

73
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:06,385
- Alright, this version is
called "Save The Princess."

74
00:03:06,385 --> 00:03:09,057
I'm trying to get Laura to her castle

75
00:03:09,057 --> 00:03:12,145
without the villains taking her down.

76
00:03:12,145 --> 00:03:15,812
("Flight of the Bumblebee")

77
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,992
(laughs)

78
00:03:23,872 --> 00:03:25,243
I died but she made it in!

79
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:26,723
The princess made it.

80
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,212
Alright thus far, the princess has made it

81
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:30,291
safely to the castle twice.

82
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:32,131
- I wanted to be a princess too.

83
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:34,619
- Okay, so I'm trying to protect Elise.

84
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,452
Ready?

85
00:03:35,452 --> 00:03:36,285
Go!

86
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,192
I got you!

87
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:42,760
Oh, she made it!

88
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,840
(cheers)

89
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,904
She made it!

90
00:03:44,904 --> 00:03:45,737
She made it!

91
00:03:45,737 --> 00:03:47,337
You barely made it!

92
00:03:47,337 --> 00:03:48,754
That was awesome!

93
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:50,680
(thuds)

94
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,248
(laughing) Are you okay?

95
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,498
Oh my goodness!

96
00:03:57,663 --> 00:04:01,991
Okay, we're going to do
everyone against everyone now.

97
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,203
On your mark, get set,

98
00:04:04,203 --> 00:04:05,036
Go!

99
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,336
On your mark, go!

100
00:04:14,274 --> 00:04:17,941
(slow suspense music plays)

101
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,137
- Where are we going?

102
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:22,706
- To the gym.

103
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:23,914
- Yeah. We're going to the workout gym.

104
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,802
Oh, wow, look at that outfit!

105
00:04:26,802 --> 00:04:27,994
Are you going to wear that to the gym?

106
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:28,908
- Yep!

107
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:29,954
- Let's go.

108
00:04:29,954 --> 00:04:31,458
- So this is a light up purse.

109
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,876
- Is this one of the
toys you got last night.

110
00:04:32,876 --> 00:04:35,959
- Uh-huh, and here's how you open it.

111
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:37,665
- Whoa.

112
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:38,847
You want to get it dark in here?

113
00:04:38,847 --> 00:04:39,704
- Uh-huh.

114
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:41,787
- Let's close the blinds.

115
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,841
- I want to change it to this.

116
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:46,890
- How fun!

117
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,083
- Oh, look!

118
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:50,393
I could put it up all day and night.

119
00:04:50,393 --> 00:04:52,258
- It's 30 to zero.

120
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:53,977
- So I tell the kids after
we've cleaned up the house,

121
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,145
they could all have ten
minutes, playing an app game.

122
00:04:57,145 --> 00:04:59,649
So, Elise, what are you playing right now?

123
00:04:59,649 --> 00:05:01,209
I think it's the bubble island one.

124
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,107
- Yeah.

125
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:03,154
- And what are you guys playing?

126
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:05,482
- (in unison) Madden Nobels.

127
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:09,010
- So the Giants, they did a long run,

128
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,979
and I barely stopped them.

129
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,085
- The boys kind of go through

130
00:05:12,085 --> 00:05:12,918
different games that they like.

131
00:05:12,918 --> 00:05:15,142
Like you guys did Crash
Royale for a long time.

132
00:05:15,142 --> 00:05:17,366
- And then we went through bike race

133
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:19,010
and now we do Madden Nobel.

134
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,114
- I would love to hear in the comments

135
00:05:20,114 --> 00:05:22,026
what your favorite app games are.

136
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:25,499
- Janae just woke up from her nap.

137
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:26,332
Hey!

138
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,213
(coos)

139
00:05:30,213 --> 00:05:31,046
There you go.

140
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,895
Good morning.

141
00:05:32,895 --> 00:05:35,895
(jolly music plays)

142
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:39,565
- I'm just doing my squats.

143
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:41,648
(laughs)

144
00:05:42,829 --> 00:05:43,662
- Yay!

145
00:05:44,855 --> 00:05:47,272
And then she starts clapping.

146
00:05:50,842 --> 00:05:53,592
Who's getting ready for the game?

147
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:58,323
♪ I got my head on the game ♪

148
00:05:58,323 --> 00:06:00,142
So, Isaac is talking about
how he's a little bit

149
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,197
nervous about the game.

150
00:06:01,197 --> 00:06:02,341
And when I was growing up,

151
00:06:02,341 --> 00:06:04,717
I would get so nervous
and anxious about a game,

152
00:06:04,717 --> 00:06:06,543
I would throw up sometimes.

153
00:06:06,543 --> 00:06:08,269
So I'm telling him that's normal.

154
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:09,643
But let us know in the poll,

155
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:12,369
before you play game or
put on a show or perform,

156
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:15,199
do you feel nervous and
how nervous do you feel?

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,631
Let us know in the poll.

158
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:17,767
- I'm feeling pretty nervous.

159
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:20,199
Not to the point where I,
like, throw up and stuff,

160
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,825
but I feel a little nervous.

161
00:06:22,825 --> 00:06:25,967
- When I was scared, my
tummy always felt funny.

162
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:27,855
- Like butterflies in your tummy is

163
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,415
the way people explain it.

164
00:06:29,415 --> 00:06:30,424
- Yeah.

165
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:33,757
(energetic music plays)

166
00:06:39,935 --> 00:06:42,855
Today is wacky wild sock day.

167
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:45,663
- That's why they have all the fun socks.

168
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:48,996
(energetic music plays)

169
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,622
- So the last several
days here in Kansas City

170
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:54,044
have been dreary and overcast.

171
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:55,412
Like, they're just cloudy, there's rain,

172
00:06:55,412 --> 00:06:57,142
there's freezing rain.

173
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,268
I feel it affecting myself, emotionally.

174
00:06:59,268 --> 00:07:01,309
Just kind of feel down.

175
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:02,804
And I was thinking about that today

176
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,884
and I found myself looking
through the forecast.

177
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,572
I'm like, come on, sunshine!

178
00:07:06,572 --> 00:07:08,579
And I realize that I needed
to actually remind myself

179
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:12,431
that this rain, this moisture,
is what makes Kansas City

180
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,966
such a beautiful, lush, green place

181
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:16,142
and I love that and so
I just need to remember

182
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:19,582
to appreciate the weather and hopefully

183
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,137
that'll help me get through that.

184
00:07:21,137 --> 00:07:22,742
I think that's so true in my life too,

185
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:26,400
sometimes I get so irritated
with any little hiccup in life

186
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,648
so often, those challenges,
those little hurdles

187
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,392
of everyday life are what
teach us and help us grow.

188
00:07:32,392 --> 00:07:34,217
Instead of being frustrated with them,

189
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:36,760
I feel like I need to practice gratitude

190
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,064
and that's easier said than
done must mean it's working.

191
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:43,564
- I'm putting the batteries
in for Laura's microphone.

192
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,576
- (sings)

193
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,250
- Okay, let's try this.

194
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,833
- Oh, we are the greatest show!

195
00:07:52,946 --> 00:07:55,084
Daddy, does it have a phone?

196
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:56,194
- That's a microphone.

197
00:07:56,194 --> 00:07:57,730
It doesn't have a telephone.

198
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:58,795
It just takes your voice and

199
00:07:58,795 --> 00:08:01,122
amplifies it out to everybody else.

200
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:03,234
So you could push that
with your feet, like watch.

201
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:07,734
(singing) And I will always love you.

202
00:08:14,445 --> 00:08:17,362
- I'm the children and I'm singing.

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,689
- Hey, well let me say,
let me say, you're welcome

204
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:27,841
for the wonderful world you know.

205
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:30,345
- Tomorrow, tomorrow.

206
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:32,428
- You're only a day away!

207
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:37,762
- Moana.

208
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:41,754
- Janae just signed "shoes".

209
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,866
She saw Elise's shoes
and she wanted them on.

210
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:46,450
- Yeah!

211
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,794
Can you say shoes?

212
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,877
Shoes, shoes!

213
00:08:50,313 --> 00:08:51,396
She's trying!

214
00:08:53,586 --> 00:08:56,503
Oh you want to show him the movies?

215
00:08:57,746 --> 00:08:59,487
She's like "how do I wear all the shoes?"

216
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,993
That microphone.

217
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:02,777
That's an exciting toy!

218
00:09:02,777 --> 00:09:04,575
- You can hear them, singing back there.

219
00:09:04,575 --> 00:09:05,575
Good thing we're heading out.

220
00:09:05,575 --> 00:09:06,678
- Yep!

221
00:09:06,678 --> 00:09:08,183
- So Kendra and I are going
on a date night tonight.

222
00:09:08,183 --> 00:09:09,190
It should be an adventure.

223
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:11,183
- I'm wearing my new shirt
that got earlier this week

224
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:12,080
and I'm really liking it.

225
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,838
And I think we have big
plans to eat and plan.

226
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:16,159
I love to plan.

227
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,255
I love to bring all my
notebooks and line them up

228
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:20,199
and it's like let's figure out life!

229
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:23,215
- So Elise has a pretty lose tooth.

230
00:09:23,215 --> 00:09:25,327
- You have no teeth left!

231
00:09:25,327 --> 00:09:26,160
- I know!

232
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,551
How are you going to eat?

233
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,375
- You'll have to only eat ice cream.

234
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:32,024
- And mashed potatoes.

235
00:09:32,024 --> 00:09:34,357
- (babbles)

236
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,800
Are you performing?

237
00:09:42,800 --> 00:00:00,000
- Good night, J House out.
