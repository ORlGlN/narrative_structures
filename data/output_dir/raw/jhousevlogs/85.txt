1
00:00:00,412 --> 00:00:03,152
- You know in real life I
wouldn't want to eat a camel.

2
00:00:03,152 --> 00:00:04,847
- [Kendra] Definitely not.

3
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:06,380
And I'm going to try to do

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,425
Jenae's hair for the very first time.

5
00:00:07,425 --> 00:00:09,886
- It's a new wonderland.

6
00:00:09,886 --> 00:00:11,929
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:12,951
(screams)

8
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,158
- Bye.

9
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:16,741
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,267
- [Jeremy] Good morning.

11
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,637
- Good morning.

12
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:22,262
- [Jeremy] We have
breakfast ready, come on.

13
00:00:22,262 --> 00:00:23,179
- Yay, yay.

14
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:29,977
Hello?

15
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,137
How you doing?

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,823
- Our camera is still lost.

17
00:00:35,823 --> 00:00:37,889
We were really hoping it would
turn up somewhere, somehow

18
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:39,933
and it just hasn't.

19
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:42,789
We're filming with an old camera today,

20
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:44,019
hoping it'll show up.

21
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:45,807
But if by the end of the day, it hasn't,

22
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:48,199
we are just going to
have to order a new one.

23
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:49,569
I feel like whenever we lose something,

24
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:51,287
there's this inner struggle of

25
00:00:51,287 --> 00:00:53,075
how long do you wait
before you replace it.

26
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,211
There's the fear that as
soon as you replace it,

27
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,396
you'll find the old one.

28
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:58,021
Tonight, we're having a family movie night

29
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,646
and it is a classic.

30
00:00:59,646 --> 00:01:00,575
Do you wanna tell them
which one we're gonna watch?

31
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:02,084
- The real Grinch.

32
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:03,478
- [Kendra] The real Grinch.

33
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:05,266
- The real Grinch day.

34
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,309
- The kids have watched
the old animated Grinch

35
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,027
a couple times, but they've never seen

36
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:11,163
the what's it called, live action.

37
00:01:11,163 --> 00:01:12,696
They've never seen that Grinch.

38
00:01:12,696 --> 00:01:15,947
So tonight, we're going to
have a Grinchy celebration.

39
00:01:15,947 --> 00:01:19,267
So I'm putting the roast beast
in the crock pot right now.

40
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:20,451
- How about the Who Pudding?

41
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:21,659
- [Kendra] Who Pudding and Who Hash?

42
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:22,581
- Uh huh.

43
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:23,696
- That's what we're gonna do.

44
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,229
Well we just do simple
stockings at our house,

45
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:27,365
but I needed to go buy
an new stocking this year

46
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,967
because Jenae needs a stocking.

47
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,592
So we're getting ready to hang them up.

48
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:32,566
I use these, what are these things called,

49
00:01:32,566 --> 00:01:34,702
Command Stripe hanger things.

50
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:36,397
Isaac's helping me put them up.

51
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,116
So we're putting those up.

52
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:39,555
- It's on pretty little.

53
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:41,274
- [Kendra] Let's put up a
few more of those hooks.

54
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,295
What do you think?

55
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:43,572
- I think I wanna try one.

56
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,871
- [Kendra] So now we've
got these little hooks

57
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,914
that just come from underneath our mantle.

58
00:01:47,914 --> 00:01:50,492
Isaac's doing a great job
helping me get them up.

59
00:01:50,492 --> 00:01:53,812
Then when we're done with
them, we just pull them off.

60
00:01:53,812 --> 00:01:55,182
Do you wanna hang up the stockings?

61
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,274
- Sure.

62
00:01:56,274 --> 00:01:57,319
Tada.

63
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,106
- [Kendra] The official
hanging of the stocking.

64
00:01:59,106 --> 00:02:01,754
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

65
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:03,797
except for the girl that was hiccuping.

66
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:06,214
(bell music)

67
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:10,275
You wanna get the toys out?

68
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:11,108
- Trees.

69
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,569
- Let's get out Baby Jesus.

70
00:02:15,732 --> 00:02:18,588
(piano music)

71
00:02:18,588 --> 00:02:20,864
I have a hard time knowing
which one's Joseph.

72
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:23,000
- The shepherd holds a baby sheep.

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,670
(piano music)

74
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,920
Do you see Mary and Joseph?

75
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,929
It's an angel.

76
00:02:30,929 --> 00:02:33,042
The angel goes on top.

77
00:02:33,042 --> 00:02:35,016
Just push it right there.

78
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,990
- This one matches with that.

79
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,289
- That's a thing for hay for the horses.

80
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,169
- How ago did we get this?

81
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,027
- [Kendra] We got this
when you were a baby.

82
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,527
(piano music)

83
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:47,700
It's doing it.

84
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,806
Isn't that the coolest toy?

85
00:02:50,806 --> 00:02:52,849
I love this thing.

86
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,078
- This isn't safe to sleep in.

87
00:02:55,078 --> 00:02:56,587
- [Kendra] You don't think stables

88
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:57,609
are very safe to sleep in?

89
00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:00,024
- But I think inside of it is safe.

90
00:03:00,024 --> 00:03:02,485
- [Kendra] Yeah, it'd be safe,
but would it be very warm?

91
00:03:02,485 --> 00:03:03,762
- No.

92
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:05,736
- [Kendra] What did you find?

93
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,319
Did you find a toy?

94
00:03:09,405 --> 00:03:11,959
Jenae just woke up from her
nap, so it's her first time

95
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:15,210
seeing the little play nativity toy.

96
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,793
You like the camel?

97
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:20,829
She's a fan of the camel.

98
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,199
Why's that funny?

99
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:24,335
- Because Jenae's sucking on that.

100
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:26,750
- You know in real life I
wouldn't wanna eat a camel.

101
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,770
- [Kendra] Definitely not.

102
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:32,277
She's standing up, this is the
perfect spot for her to play.

103
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:35,736
(Away in a Manger)

104
00:03:35,736 --> 00:03:37,640
She's excited.

105
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,890
It makes noise!

106
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:45,674
So we bought this nativity
toy back when Isaac

107
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:48,484
was like two years old
and Elise was just a baby.

108
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:50,202
So I just have fond memories of each

109
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,804
of the kids playing with it.

110
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:53,314
One of my favorite memories was when Isaac

111
00:03:53,314 --> 00:03:54,800
was like four years old

112
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,588
and I looked down and
he was playing with this

113
00:03:56,588 --> 00:03:57,958
little toy school bus.

114
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,257
He had Mary and Joseph in the school bus.

115
00:04:00,257 --> 00:04:01,627
I was like, what are you doing?

116
00:04:01,627 --> 00:04:04,529
He said, oh Joseph's taking
Mary on the bus to Bethlehem.

117
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:07,594
I was thinking, I bet Mary
wished there had been a bus.

118
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:09,150
We're getting ready for church

119
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,100
and I'm going to try to do

120
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,910
Jenae's hair for the very first time.

121
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,976
She's never had it done.

122
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:17,067
- [Jeremy] It's getting longer.

123
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:18,484
I think she does-

124
00:04:19,714 --> 00:04:20,797
She loves it.

125
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:30,396
- Well I think that was a fail.

126
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:31,418
- [Jeremy] There it is.

127
00:04:31,418 --> 00:04:33,717
- She did not like it and I don't know

128
00:04:33,717 --> 00:04:35,412
if she has quite enough hair yet.

129
00:04:35,412 --> 00:04:37,292
- [Jeremy] It's like a comb over kind of.

130
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,939
- There's not much there.

131
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:41,658
Okay, we'll take that out.

132
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:42,842
Do you like that.

133
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,467
- [Jeremy] There we go.

134
00:04:44,467 --> 00:04:46,000
- Do you like getting your hair brushed?

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,229
- [Jeremy] She's like why
are you messing with my hair?

136
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:49,251
- [Kendra] You ready to go buddy?

137
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:50,179
- Yep.

138
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,387
- [Jeremy] Looking good.

139
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:53,337
- Well Jenae clearly
did not like the attempt

140
00:04:53,337 --> 00:04:55,218
at the ponytail, but I
found this little clip

141
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:58,283
which looks like it's just
balancing on her head.

142
00:04:58,283 --> 00:05:01,186
But it's actually attached
to hair and it's working.

143
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:03,415
Do you have a little bow on your hair.

144
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,969
- [Jeremy] Yeah, first hairdo.

145
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:07,385
- First hairdo attempt.

146
00:05:07,385 --> 00:05:10,497
(bell music)

147
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:12,192
- So we're just trying to go into church.

148
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:14,031
Kendra wanted to take a quick picture.

149
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,314
- They all look so Christmasy.

150
00:05:15,314 --> 00:05:16,411
One,

151
00:05:16,411 --> 00:05:17,850
two,

152
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,683
three.

153
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:22,239
- So last year Caleb took some lights

154
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:23,841
and he decorated a box.

155
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:26,303
And the kids were wanting
to recreate that this year.

156
00:05:26,303 --> 00:05:27,510
But we're upgrading it a little bit.

157
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,646
We're gonna make a light fort.

158
00:05:29,646 --> 00:05:30,668
You guys ready?

159
00:05:30,668 --> 00:05:31,690
- [Kids] Yeah.

160
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,874
- Can we grab our supplies.

161
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,032
(rock music)

162
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:37,820
- [Jeremy] So Elise, what are
you gonna put your lights on?

163
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,375
- This right here.

164
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:40,467
- [Jeremy] That's gonna be fun.

165
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:42,696
- I have a plan, but
I'm gonna start the plan

166
00:05:42,696 --> 00:05:44,484
with something that you don't know.

167
00:05:44,484 --> 00:05:46,109
- [Jeremy] Okay, it'll be a surprise.

168
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:47,642
How about you Isaac, what
are you gonna be decorating?

169
00:05:47,642 --> 00:05:49,685
- I'm gonna be decorating the soccer goal.

170
00:05:49,685 --> 00:05:51,055
- [Jeremy] The soccer goal in there.

171
00:05:51,055 --> 00:05:52,332
Laura, what are you decorating?

172
00:05:52,332 --> 00:05:53,354
- This.

173
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,631
- [Jeremy] The crate?

174
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:55,464
Cool.

175
00:05:56,697 --> 00:05:58,393
- Daddy, I can't do this one.

176
00:05:58,393 --> 00:06:00,180
- [Jeremy] You need a little help?

177
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,597
(rock music)

178
00:06:15,552 --> 00:06:17,247
You guys connected it together?

179
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:18,362
- Got it.

180
00:06:18,362 --> 00:06:20,150
- [Jeremy] Okay, connect it to Elise's.

181
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,171
- Almost ready.

182
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,193
- [Jeremy] Almost.

183
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:23,563
- Just one more loop.

184
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:24,770
- [Jeremy] You're doing great.

185
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,210
Sticking them in?

186
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,043
Awesome.

187
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,597
Okay, the kids have all the lights set up.

188
00:06:31,597 --> 00:06:34,151
We're gonna turn it on
and see how it turned out.

189
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:36,357
Okay, we got all the lights off.

190
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:38,493
Go ahead and plug it in.

191
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:40,660
(screams)

192
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:49,102
- [Caleb] It's a new wonderland.

193
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,144
It's a new wonderland.

194
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:55,305
- It went from dark.

195
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:57,388
- This tunnel is amazing.

196
00:06:58,555 --> 00:07:00,088
- [Jeremy] Do you guys
like putting up lights?

197
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:01,365
- Yes.
- Yeah.

198
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:04,105
- [Elise] I think, no look
it's like a tunnel with lights.

199
00:07:04,105 --> 00:07:06,241
- [Laura] Mine went to here.

200
00:07:06,241 --> 00:07:08,703
- I wish we had more lights.

201
00:07:08,703 --> 00:07:10,839
We could win the light-

202
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,860
- [Jeremy] Do you guys think

203
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,882
Nae-Nae would like it down here?

204
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,182
- [All] Yeah.

205
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:17,015
(Christmas music)

206
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:28,018
- Somebody's here.

207
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:30,851
- [Jeremy] Yeah, go see who it is.

208
00:07:34,618 --> 00:07:35,451
Go see, who is it?

209
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:37,259
- [Laura] Justin and Ashley.

210
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,303
- [Jeremy] It's our cousins.

211
00:07:39,303 --> 00:07:41,470
(screams)

212
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,461
Hey Elizabeth.

213
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,853
- [Kendra] Look who's
here, it's Elizabeth.

214
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:54,827
What you guys doing downstairs?

215
00:07:54,827 --> 00:07:56,359
- We're just playing house.

216
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,942
But we're pretending in 10 days

217
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:03,488
there's gonna be 10 hurricanes.

218
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:05,740
- [Kendra] 10 hurricanes in 10 days?

219
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,762
- Yeah

220
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:07,876
- [Kendra] Oh you'd better be safe.

221
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:09,571
- This is my baby doll.

222
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,893
- [Kendra] What's your baby doll's name?

223
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:12,976
- Rose Alice.

224
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:15,887
- [Kendra] Oh I like it.

225
00:08:15,887 --> 00:08:17,257
Are you playing with Elizabeth?

226
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:18,340
Hi girls, hi.

227
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,960
- So we're planning on
watching The Grinch tonight,

228
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,607
so Kendra made some
roast beast for dinner.

229
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:26,743
Got all the kid's plates ready.

230
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:28,461
And we're calling this Who Hash.

231
00:08:28,461 --> 00:08:29,294
It's all in the marketing.

232
00:08:29,294 --> 00:08:30,127
It's really just potatoes.

233
00:08:30,127 --> 00:08:31,805
But it feels more fun to say you're having

234
00:08:31,805 --> 00:08:33,337
roast beast and Who Hash.

235
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:34,870
So the internet and especially Pinterest

236
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,934
is full of all these creative
and cool Grinch desserts.

237
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,325
And I just wasn't feeling
up to doing anything really

238
00:08:40,326 --> 00:08:42,881
overly creative or difficult today.

239
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:47,048
So we're doing something
easy, which is mint ice cream.

240
00:08:49,721 --> 00:08:51,902
Everything's more fun
with whip cream on top.

241
00:08:51,902 --> 00:08:54,178
(screams)

242
00:08:54,178 --> 00:08:55,873
Laura's kind of developing a high pitched,

243
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:59,286
shrill shriek and it like gets in my ears.

244
00:08:59,286 --> 00:09:01,004
There you go Laura, you ready?

245
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:01,837
- Yum.

246
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:03,974
- Bye.

247
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,472
- [Kendra] Bye, she is waving at you guys.

248
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:09,654
Thanks for coming to play with us.

249
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:10,487
Bye, bye.

250
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:14,499
- [Jeremy] Bye you guys.
- Bye.

251
00:09:16,945 --> 00:09:18,385
- I don't think so.

252
00:09:18,385 --> 00:09:21,302
- Doubt, another unmistakable sign-

253
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:27,185
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

254
00:09:27,185 --> 00:09:29,435
(laughter)

255
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,664
- I found our first Geocache.

256
00:09:33,664 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
