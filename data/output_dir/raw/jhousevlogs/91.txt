1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,241
- So we were invited out by one

2
00:00:01,241 --> 00:00:03,417
of the local news
stations to come and show

3
00:00:03,417 --> 00:00:06,518
the kids around to see what
happens at a news station.

4
00:00:06,518 --> 00:00:09,045
(bright music)

5
00:00:09,045 --> 00:00:10,150
- What?

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,531
♪ Say goodbye, say goodbye ♪

7
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:13,078
- [Jeremy] No, that'd be
a good anniversary gift.

8
00:00:13,078 --> 00:00:15,911
- And he got the curtains hung up.

9
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:21,494
So the boys are supposed to
be doing their handwriting

10
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:23,777
and their spelling work right now,

11
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:28,764
but they figured out
something that's way more fun.

12
00:00:28,764 --> 00:00:30,253
(playful music)

13
00:00:30,253 --> 00:00:31,086
- Ah! (laughs)

14
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:31,919
- [Kendra] What?

15
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:32,909
- Awesome.

16
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:34,269
- [Kendra] What did you guys create?

17
00:00:34,269 --> 00:00:36,997
- It's a canapault.
- It's a catapult.

18
00:00:36,997 --> 00:00:37,970
- Catapult.

19
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,325
- [Kendra] I thought
you said a cannonball.

20
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:42,157
- I hold it like this
and then he launches it.

21
00:00:42,157 --> 00:00:43,766
Isaac, can I have a turn to launch it?

22
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:44,965
- So we're gonna do this for a minute,

23
00:00:44,965 --> 00:00:47,206
and then do spelling and handwriting.

24
00:00:47,206 --> 00:00:48,801
What?
(lively rock music)

25
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:49,634
Whoa.

26
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:52,627
- [Isaac] Our second time.

27
00:00:52,627 --> 00:00:53,468
(laughing)

28
00:00:53,468 --> 00:00:54,301
It went--

29
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,968
And a sock this one.

30
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:00,677
- [Kendra] Whoa.

31
00:01:11,682 --> 00:01:13,432
Whoa, good one Isaac.

32
00:01:15,016 --> 00:01:15,849
Whoa.

33
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,250
Whoa.

34
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,722
It's Jeremy.

35
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:20,838
- Hey.

36
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:22,905
- Hey, it's me and my camera.

37
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:24,376
- Hi camera.

38
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,959
(upbeat music)

39
00:01:32,603 --> 00:01:35,187
So we were invited out by one
of the local news stations

40
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:36,506
to come and show the kids around

41
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:38,459
to see what happens at a news station

42
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,292
and answer some questions

43
00:01:39,292 --> 00:01:42,659
about our service celebration that we did.

44
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:43,492
- Elise,

45
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:44,357
right?
- Yes.

46
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:45,305
- Nice to meet you.

47
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,721
Laura, is that your name?

48
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:47,554
- Yeah.

49
00:01:47,554 --> 00:01:49,191
- Hi, nice to meet you.

50
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,209
And Janae.

51
00:01:50,209 --> 00:01:51,042
- Yes.

52
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:51,875
- This is Cody.

53
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:53,516
He's the one who invited us out.

54
00:01:53,516 --> 00:01:54,371
(lively music)

55
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:56,275
- So this is where we
get all of our stories

56
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:57,903
for the day and then we go out

57
00:01:57,903 --> 00:01:59,331
and we put 'em together.

58
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:02,234
And there's a map of the different areas.

59
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:03,067
Do you know your--

60
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:06,594
- Is that the red like
where all the storms are?

61
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,177
(lively music)

62
00:02:10,508 --> 00:02:14,675
- [Jeremy] Guys look,
they're filming right there.

63
00:02:17,615 --> 00:02:18,582
- So this is the assignment desk.

64
00:02:18,582 --> 00:02:19,547
You see all the scanners over there,

65
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,626
all the green lights?

66
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:23,069
If you look at all the TVs up here,

67
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:24,548
they all have something different on them,

68
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,790
so you can see the forecast.

69
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,873
This is Greg.

70
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:31,101
You've probably seen
Mom and Dad edit, right?

71
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:33,141
- So they use the same program in editing

72
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:34,717
that we use and it's been fun for the kids

73
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:37,511
to see that, because they've
been learning how to use it.

74
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:39,198
- [Cody] We've got a junior editor here.

75
00:02:39,198 --> 00:02:40,138
- Well I have a couple

76
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,883
of computers at home.
- They've been learning.

77
00:02:41,883 --> 00:02:43,447
- And you hear the reporter talking,

78
00:02:43,447 --> 00:02:46,224
you don't see him on
camera a lot of times,

79
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,092
- [Kendra] Oh.

80
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:48,464
- It's a voiceover.
- Record here,

81
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:51,401
- it's kind of a old
microphone, but you can--

82
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:53,161
- [Jeremy] It's like the sound studio.

83
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,800
- Breaking news.

84
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,946
- Just recorded it, see?
- Oh they recorded it.

85
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:58,415
- [Caleb's Voice] Breaking News.

86
00:02:58,415 --> 00:03:01,057
- Did you hear yourself?
- Hey, cool.

87
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:03,024
- When we record something,

88
00:03:03,024 --> 00:03:04,370
then Greg will take that and go edit

89
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,112
it up on the computer.

90
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,087
- These are cards?

91
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:07,920
- Yeah, they have to store--

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,701
- No, so this is from a long time ago--

93
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,117
- [Greg] Those are DVC tapes there.

94
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:15,018
- So you see that red light
that's hanging up above?

95
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:16,930
That means that they're on TV right now.

96
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,513
(bright music)

97
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,362
- Thank you so much sweetheart.

98
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:28,783
What are your names?

99
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:29,846
- Caleb.

100
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:30,679
- Caleb.

101
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,770
- What's your name?

102
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,603
- [Laura] Laura.

103
00:03:32,603 --> 00:03:33,436
- Laura.

104
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:34,269
- Isaac.

105
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:35,102
- Isaac, I love that name.

106
00:03:35,102 --> 00:03:35,935
- Elise.

107
00:03:35,935 --> 00:03:36,768
- Elise.

108
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:37,601
- [Jeremy] Janae.

109
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,568
- You're too little to tell your name.

110
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:39,401
- She says I'm Janae.

111
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:41,323
- She's smiling at me though.

112
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:44,105
(bright music)

113
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:45,525
- This is Rob and Rachel.

114
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:46,358
Say hi.

115
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,191
- Hello.
- Hi.

116
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:48,024
- Hi.

117
00:03:48,024 --> 00:03:48,930
- We never get visitors.

118
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,561
- You guys want a picture up here?

119
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,394
- Sure.
- Oh absolutely.

120
00:03:51,394 --> 00:03:53,324
- [Jeremy] So Caleb, what's
going on in the news?

121
00:03:53,324 --> 00:03:55,849
- At least it's warmer than it use to.

122
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:56,682
- [Cody] There you go.

123
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:57,953
- [Rob] Hey you're better
than me, my friend.

124
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:58,786
- And iPads.

125
00:03:58,786 --> 00:03:59,632
Those have our scripts too sometimes.

126
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:03,799
- And you see the white
letters on the screen there?

127
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,817
- [Caleb] Is that what you say?

128
00:04:06,817 --> 00:04:08,243
- [Cody] A lot of times, yeah.

129
00:04:08,243 --> 00:04:10,826
(bright music)

130
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:18,680
- [Jeremy] It's on TV now.

131
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,513
- [Weatherman] And then the cold air

132
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:21,877
just comes down to the south.

133
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:24,460
(bright music)

134
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:35,370
- [Cody] So he goes through
that and then he tells--

135
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,778
- [Director] You're
directing today's show,

136
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:38,149
get up in there.

137
00:04:38,149 --> 00:04:39,620
- [Jeremy] Caleb's the director.

138
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,783
- Stand by camera one.

139
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:42,616
- [Director] Ready one.

140
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,525
- Ready one.
- Ready one.

141
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:44,509
- [Director] Take one.

142
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:45,594
- Take one.

143
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:46,427
- [Director] Good job.

144
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:47,260
- [Jeremy] And then that
means they're gonna go

145
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,009
right to that camera or
right to that picture.

146
00:04:50,009 --> 00:04:51,040
- Take camera two.

147
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,873
- [Director] Alright.

148
00:04:51,873 --> 00:04:52,781
Yeah.
(clapping)

149
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:55,125
- Stand by to roll 61.

150
00:04:55,125 --> 00:04:56,088
- [Director] And roll 61.

151
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:56,994
- Roll 61.

152
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:58,008
- [Director] And take it.

153
00:04:58,008 --> 00:04:58,976
- Take it.

154
00:04:58,976 --> 00:05:00,904
- Alright, good job.
- Awesome.

155
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:02,156
- Stand by camera one.

156
00:05:02,156 --> 00:05:04,128
Ready one and take one.

157
00:05:04,128 --> 00:05:07,473
- [Kendra] Do you guys see
all those buttons down there?

158
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,822
(bright music)

159
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:13,509
- Once we get home, I'm
gonna be the news director.

160
00:05:13,509 --> 00:05:15,165
- [Jeremy] You're gonna pretend?

161
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:15,998
- Mmm-hmm.

162
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:16,952
(lively enchanting music)

163
00:05:16,952 --> 00:05:19,428
- Oh yeee! (laughing)

164
00:05:19,428 --> 00:05:21,201
(laughing)

165
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:22,034
- [Jeremy] Try to look at the camera,

166
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:23,430
so you can see the camera while looking.

167
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,622
- [Kendra] Cover your ears

168
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:26,061
when you're talking about the traffic.

169
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,884
- So we're getting run into by traffic.

170
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:29,837
(laughing)

171
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:31,986
- [Cody] Is there a
traffic jam or it's the--

172
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:34,561
- No, it's perfectly fine,
- It's just completely good.

173
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:36,197
but we need a little--
- Good.

174
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:38,245
(lively enchanting music)

175
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:39,486
- The reporter comes in,

176
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,819
and I see some of the screens over here.

177
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,126
'Cause you probably remember
when Dad started this thing.

178
00:05:51,126 --> 00:05:52,034
- It's kind of changed,

179
00:05:52,034 --> 00:05:55,225
like at the beginning, I
didn't think it was a big deal,

180
00:05:55,225 --> 00:05:59,472
but now it's a lot different
than it used to be.

181
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:00,893
- [Cody] See ya.

182
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:01,814
- [Jeremy] So what did you guys think

183
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:03,647
of seeing the news place?

184
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,190
- That was awesome.
- I liked it.

185
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,654
- What I liked about it

186
00:06:06,654 --> 00:06:08,987
was like we looked on the TV

187
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:13,596
and it was the people you
normally see in the desk,

188
00:06:13,596 --> 00:06:15,605
then we looked straight the other way

189
00:06:15,605 --> 00:06:17,227
and it was the real people.

190
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:18,254
- [Jeremy] That's so cool.

191
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,731
- [Kendra] Look at all those satellites,

192
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:22,125
so those are for receiving the shows

193
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,877
that we watch on TV.

194
00:06:23,877 --> 00:06:27,044
(bright guitar music)

195
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,154
- Well that was really cool to get to see

196
00:06:29,154 --> 00:06:30,922
the behind the scenes of a news station

197
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:31,990
and now we have one problem,

198
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:33,589
and it's that I'm starving

199
00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:34,927
so we decided to go somewhere fun to eat.

200
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:35,760
We're gonna take the kids

201
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,343
to one of our favorite
spots, Ginger Sue's.

202
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,082
So we're here at the restaurant

203
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:45,747
and this might've been a really bad idea.

204
00:06:45,747 --> 00:06:48,142
Jeremy has already had to
take two different kids

205
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,830
out of the restaurant,

206
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,553
just to remind them how
we behave in restaurants.

207
00:06:52,553 --> 00:06:54,683
Everybody's back now, and
I'm hoping that we can have

208
00:06:54,683 --> 00:06:57,263
some good behavior, because
it can be really fun,

209
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:58,909
but maybe the kids are just too tired

210
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:01,420
from already behaving
well at the news station.

211
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,544
- You drinking out of a straw?
(sweet music)

212
00:07:03,544 --> 00:07:05,358
- I forgot her bib.

213
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,255
- [Jeremy] It's gonna get messy.

214
00:07:06,255 --> 00:07:08,463
- It's gonna get messy.

215
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:09,647
- [Elise] I have a good idea.

216
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:10,847
You could use that.

217
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,584
- You could tie around her neck.

218
00:07:13,584 --> 00:07:16,271
- Do you guys think this would
make a good bib, like this?

219
00:07:16,271 --> 00:07:17,426
Got one.

220
00:07:17,426 --> 00:07:18,968
I am prepared.

221
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:19,869
- [Jeremy] It was in the bag.

222
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:21,619
- Of course Mama's--

223
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,453
- [Jeremy] Those look good.

224
00:07:25,453 --> 00:07:27,418
- [Kendra] These kids are getting good.

225
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,494
I remember when I had to
butter and cut all of these.

226
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:31,381
- Elise is my helper.

227
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:33,453
We're gonna go and try to get curtains.

228
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:37,163
(jazzy bright music)

229
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:38,516
So before we put our Christmas tree in,

230
00:07:38,516 --> 00:07:40,724
we want to put some blinds up

231
00:07:40,724 --> 00:07:42,028
in our front room.

232
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:45,195
Elise is here to help me pick 'em out.

233
00:07:46,236 --> 00:07:47,543
- That's one that I really like.

234
00:07:47,543 --> 00:07:49,395
- [Jeremy] I think that's
one of my favorites too.

235
00:07:49,395 --> 00:07:50,228
I'm just not sure how white

236
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:52,728
would look in that front room.

237
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,707
Maybe Mom would like that for Christmas.

238
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:01,986
No, that would be a good anniversary gift.

239
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:03,069
Just kidding.

240
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:08,908
So this bright light just comes in.

241
00:08:08,908 --> 00:08:10,658
- And it's super hot.

242
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:13,682
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

243
00:08:13,682 --> 00:08:14,648
- Is it kinda like that?

244
00:08:14,648 --> 00:08:15,506
- [Jeremy] Yeah, for sure.

245
00:08:15,506 --> 00:08:17,083
I think it needs both sides though.

246
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:19,795
- So the challenge will be
opening and shutting them,

247
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:20,628
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

248
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:23,905
- 'Cause I can't really climb
up like this all the time.

249
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:25,342
And I still want to see my pretty view.

250
00:08:25,342 --> 00:08:27,470
I think that's why people have like ties.

251
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,754
I like how it blocks the light,

252
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:30,785
I don't like how it blocks the view.

253
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,169
You dancin'?
(upbeat music)

254
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:33,786
- [Jeremy] Come on.

255
00:08:33,787 --> 00:08:35,101
Do do do--

256
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,533
Alright, we're seeing what it looks like.

257
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,191
How are you feelin' about it?

258
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:41,188
- I'm not sure yet.

259
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,820
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae hates 'em.

260
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,166
- [Kendra] Do you have enough
help to hang the curtain rods?

261
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:48,805
- I think I need a couple
more kids, little ones,

262
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:51,387
little itty bitty kids to help me.

263
00:08:51,387 --> 00:08:52,220
- [Kendra] Janae?

264
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,389
- No, she is not--

265
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,386
- So since we went to
the news this morning,

266
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:57,136
the kids have wanted to play pretend,

267
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,130
that they are putting on the news.

268
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,078
So they've been researching
and they're getting ready

269
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:03,661
to put on the news.

270
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:08,685
So what do you have there Caleb?

271
00:09:08,685 --> 00:09:10,595
- It's the Earth is getting bigger.

272
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:12,848
- [Jeremy] Where did you
get this information?

273
00:09:12,848 --> 00:09:15,015
- From it's news for kids.

274
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:17,515
- [Jeremy] And you wrote
up a little summary of it?

275
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,348
- Yeah.

276
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,158
- [Jeremy] And you're gonna present it?

277
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:20,991
Awesome.

278
00:09:20,991 --> 00:09:21,996
And what's your topic gonna be Isaac?

279
00:09:21,996 --> 00:09:23,472
- Sports.

280
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:24,305
- [Jeremy] The sports stuff,

281
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:25,138
what are you gonna be doing Elise?

282
00:09:25,138 --> 00:09:26,265
- Weather and traffic.

283
00:09:26,265 --> 00:09:27,713
- [Jeremy] Alright, you guys ready?

284
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:28,546
- [Isaac] Yeah.

285
00:09:28,546 --> 00:09:29,569
- We're gonna try to put on the news.

286
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,616
I've just set up some lights for fun

287
00:09:30,616 --> 00:09:32,357
and I'm gonna run the camera.

288
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:35,105
No laughing, you're gonna
be doing the news, okay?

289
00:09:35,105 --> 00:09:38,181
Three two one,
(dramatic news music)

290
00:09:38,181 --> 00:09:39,652
you're live.

291
00:09:39,652 --> 00:09:43,069
- Welcome you all to J House Action news.

292
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:47,382
(playful music)

293
00:09:47,382 --> 00:09:49,052
(laughing)
(Jeremy laughing)

294
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:50,988
- [Jeremy] What comes next?

295
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:52,416
- The big story for today

296
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:55,854
is that the Earth is getting brighter.

297
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,943
So now we're gonna cut to the weather.

298
00:09:57,943 --> 00:10:00,187
- [Jeremy] And action.

299
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,020
(lively music)

300
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,203
- I'm so glad I can tell
you about the weather today.

301
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:08,360
Today it will be sunny,
as you see over here.

302
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,860
And tonight, there will be a tornado watch

303
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,190
and in Seattle, it's
gonna be sunny and rainy

304
00:10:18,096 --> 00:10:20,808
over here, and this week,

305
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,311
it will be warm and sunny.

306
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:25,651
And I hope you like it.

307
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:28,141
We would like to go to sports.

308
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,910
- [Jeremy] And action.

309
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,736
- Today I'm gonna tell you about

310
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:34,064
what's happening in college football.

311
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,824
Last week the top two teams got defeated

312
00:10:36,824 --> 00:10:38,455
and they were both undefeated.

313
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:40,539
There's only room for four
teams in the playoffs.

314
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,640
I think those teams are
the Wisconsin Badgers,

315
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,564
Auburn Tigers, Clemson Tigers,

316
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:46,864
and Oklahoma Sooners.

317
00:10:46,864 --> 00:10:49,029
I think the Sooners will be the champions,

318
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:51,659
because they have an awesome quarterback,

319
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,221
Baker Mayfield and they have an awesome D.

320
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:57,057
Back to Elise for traffic.

321
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:58,998
- I'm so excited to see you again.

322
00:10:58,998 --> 00:11:00,990
The road is pretty cool,
(bright music)

323
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,200
and you can see, there
is a few car crashes

324
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,003
and the police have been driving crazy

325
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:10,883
with all the car crashes.

326
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:14,931
Now as you can see, they're
all pretty good now.

327
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:16,820
And now we'll go back to Caleb.

328
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:21,491
- We all welcome you all
back to today's top story,

329
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:23,819
about the Earth getting brighter.

330
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:24,652
(laughing)

331
00:11:24,652 --> 00:11:27,485
(Jeremy laughing)

332
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:30,295
Ah!
(drumming table)

333
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:34,346
So why the Earth is
getting brighter is because

334
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,466
all the builders--

335
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:37,427
(laughing)

336
00:11:37,427 --> 00:11:40,260
(Jeremy laughing)

337
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,337
- [Jeremy] Okay cut.

338
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:46,254
And action.

339
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:49,779
(laughing)

340
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:52,032
And--

341
00:11:52,032 --> 00:11:54,069
(laughing)

342
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:55,697
- [Jeremy] Okay.

343
00:11:55,697 --> 00:11:57,456
- So why the--
(dramatic music)

344
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:00,356
(laughing)

345
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:01,787
Do it again.

346
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:04,611
So why the Earth is getting brighter,

347
00:12:04,611 --> 00:12:08,694
is because the builders
keep building more houses

348
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:14,495
and the Christmas lights
make the Earth brighter,

349
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:16,574
and it's a blue planet.

350
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:17,907
So it's amazing.

351
00:12:19,564 --> 00:12:20,836
And if you want to explore it,

352
00:12:20,836 --> 00:12:22,835
explore it with your telescope.

353
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:27,635
And we will end the day
with a saying goodbye song.

354
00:12:27,635 --> 00:12:31,511
♪ Say goodbye, say goodbye ♪

355
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:33,761
(laughing)

356
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:38,149
This is, we will say goodbye,

357
00:12:39,463 --> 00:12:41,719
because, (yelling)

358
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,935
♪ Say goodbye, say goodbye ♪

359
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:48,008
♪ To the pain of the past ♪

360
00:12:48,008 --> 00:12:49,280
- [Jeremy] What?

361
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,234
(laughing)

362
00:12:50,234 --> 00:12:51,233
- [Laughing Newscaster]
Traffic is shut down

363
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:52,566
in the meantime.

364
00:12:54,536 --> 00:12:58,703
- [Jeremy] Do you see where
the news anchors are laughing?

365
00:12:59,886 --> 00:13:02,404
- What was the question that stumped him?

366
00:13:02,404 --> 00:13:04,541
(Anderson Cooper laughing)

367
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:06,429
- [Jeremy] He's laughing.

368
00:13:06,429 --> 00:13:09,120
Real news casters breaking into laughter

369
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,452
and unable to stop.

370
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:11,313
(laugh-crying)

371
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,128
(laughing)

372
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:14,495
So we held off on putting up the curtains.

373
00:13:14,495 --> 00:13:15,328
We're gonna wait until

374
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:16,161
a little bit later this evening.

375
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:16,994
(sizzling)

376
00:13:16,994 --> 00:13:19,574
Look at what Kendra is making for dinner.

377
00:13:19,574 --> 00:13:20,860
- Chicken quesadillas.

378
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,802
- [Jeremy] It's kinda like
Mexican pizza at Taco Bell.

379
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:24,977
- [Kendra] What are they?

380
00:13:24,977 --> 00:13:28,110
These are chicken quesadillas.

381
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,476
- [Jeremy] Inspired by Thanksgiving.

382
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,643
- Yes, I ate a bunch of these
for lunch at Thanksgiving.

383
00:13:34,728 --> 00:13:37,709
What do you guys think of the
grilled chicken quesadillas?

384
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:39,244
- I like 'em.
- Look at this.

385
00:13:39,244 --> 00:13:40,476
- [Kendra] You already ate it all?

386
00:13:40,476 --> 00:13:41,823
It was so good, huh?

387
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:43,597
Here's my plate.

388
00:13:43,597 --> 00:13:45,213
- I love love love it.

389
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:46,046
- I love it.

390
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:47,101
- Well I'm really proud of Jeremy,

391
00:13:47,101 --> 00:13:48,757
he got the curtains hung up.

392
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:50,786
You are Superman.

393
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:51,981
- Is it really that big of a deal

394
00:13:51,981 --> 00:13:53,214
to hang up curtains?

395
00:13:53,214 --> 00:13:56,404
- [Kendra] Dude, we have
been married for 13 years

396
00:13:56,404 --> 00:13:57,994
and we've lived in 10 different houses,

397
00:13:57,994 --> 00:14:00,559
and we've never hung curtains.

398
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,135
- I mean we've done it in the kids' room.

399
00:14:02,135 --> 00:14:03,359
- Well that's true, good point.

400
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:04,824
I think Jeremy did a
great job hanging them up.

401
00:14:04,824 --> 00:14:06,504
My big question is if I like 'em or not.

402
00:14:06,504 --> 00:14:09,186
I think I was thinking
something a little more floral,

403
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,556
I don't know how I feel about the blue.

404
00:14:11,556 --> 00:14:13,712
- I remind you of the paint color.

405
00:14:13,712 --> 00:14:14,545
- Yeah.

406
00:14:14,545 --> 00:14:15,643
- Kendra really didn't like
it, when we got it painted.

407
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:16,927
- Like really didn't like it.

408
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,011
- Like we almost redid it.

409
00:14:19,011 --> 00:14:21,208
And I was like give it some time.

410
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,680
- And then I ended up liking it.

411
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,529
So we're gonna give this some time.

412
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:25,864
We're gonna wake up in the morning,

413
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:26,857
see what we think of it.

414
00:14:26,857 --> 00:14:27,816
But in the comments,

415
00:14:27,816 --> 00:14:29,938
let us know what you think of these.

416
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:32,494
- I think you need to see
'em in the sunlight too.

417
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:33,327
- [Kendra] I don't think it'll show

418
00:14:33,327 --> 00:14:35,321
hand prints on the kids very much.

419
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,341
It's kind of a nice blue.

420
00:14:37,341 --> 00:14:38,174
- J House out.

421
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:39,637
- [Kendra] She broke her leg?

422
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:41,143
- Mmm-hmm.
(bright music)

423
00:14:41,143 --> 00:14:42,817
- [Kendra] You have to go to surgery?

424
00:14:42,817 --> 00:14:45,184
- Oh, we forgot to put you asleep.

425
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:46,848
- Good job.

426
00:14:46,848 --> 00:14:48,160
- And I can't find it,

427
00:14:48,160 --> 00:00:00,000
and it makes me mad.
