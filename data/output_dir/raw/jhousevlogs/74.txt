1
00:00:00,185 --> 00:00:01,262
(spinner whirring)

2
00:00:01,262 --> 00:00:02,095
- [Kendra] You know it's a good toy,

3
00:00:02,095 --> 00:00:03,477
when Jeremy wants to try.

4
00:00:03,477 --> 00:00:06,234
(festive music)
(hammering)

5
00:00:06,234 --> 00:00:07,067
Whoa!

6
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,029
- I could live in these.

7
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,696
I can do everything.

8
00:00:13,673 --> 00:00:15,081
- We all go a little
strong with the make-up

9
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:16,581
when we start out.

10
00:00:19,818 --> 00:00:21,260
Well we did the whole Christmas morning

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,254
open the present thing,

12
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:23,934
and now the kids are all exploring

13
00:00:23,934 --> 00:00:25,454
and playing with their presents.

14
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:26,866
We're also getting dinner started,

15
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:28,282
which is just a ham in the Crock-Pot,

16
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,802
but unfortunately, the ham is too big.

17
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:31,776
- It's just a little too tall.

18
00:00:31,776 --> 00:00:33,324
- [Kendra] For our Crock-Pot.

19
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,149
So Jeremy's trying to trim the top,

20
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,530
so we can put the lid on.

21
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,253
- There's a bone, though.

22
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:39,468
- [Kendra] Good luck.

23
00:00:39,468 --> 00:00:41,364
Lise got out her Spin Art.

24
00:00:41,364 --> 00:00:43,270
- I first when I put the paper down

25
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,478
and I did the thing,

26
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:46,267
it just flew off.

27
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:49,784
And Mom was just like,
you need to have like,

28
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:50,764
is there any hookers?

29
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:53,640
And then I figured out these
green things were hookers.

30
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,790
- [Kendra] Okay, show us how it works.

31
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,698
(spinner cranking)

32
00:00:56,698 --> 00:00:57,531
Woo.

33
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,659
So Lise, you probably used a little bit

34
00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:02,612
too much paint on that one,

35
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,048
so use a little bit less paint.

36
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:06,600
(Kendra laughs)

37
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,613
So if you do it when it's holding still,

38
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:09,446
it just goes there,

39
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:10,529
but if you do it when you're spinning it,

40
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,746
then it's in a spiral.

41
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:13,746
There we go.

42
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:19,505
Woo.

43
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,138
Are you gonna add some blue too?

44
00:01:22,138 --> 00:01:22,971
- Yep.

45
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:24,087
- [Kendra] Whatcha been doin'?

46
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:25,591
- I'm building this.

47
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,755
- [Kendra] Hey uh, what time is it?

48
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,338
- 8:32.

49
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,735
Well that was that stopwatch.

50
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:33,009
- [Kendra] Still figuring it out?

51
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,512
- It says eleven o'clock.

52
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:35,931
- [Kendra] It is, it's eleven o'clock.

53
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,472
That's exactly right.

54
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,070
(lively music)

55
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,903
(spinner whirring)

56
00:01:40,903 --> 00:01:41,736
You know it's a good toy

57
00:01:41,736 --> 00:01:43,819
when Jeremy wants to try.

58
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:48,126
- [Jeremy] Alright, let's
see what it looks like.

59
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:49,736
- [Elise] Mmm.

60
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:50,986
- [Kendra] Mmm.

61
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:52,801
Did you finish it Caleb?

62
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:53,634
- Mmm-hmm.

63
00:01:55,769 --> 00:01:58,272
(Jeremy laughs)

64
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,658
- [Kendra] Look at that face.

65
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:00,712
- [Jeremy] She's like what?

66
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,188
- [Kendra] What is going on?

67
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,476
- [Jeremy] She's dancing.

68
00:02:03,476 --> 00:02:05,226
- [Kendra] Come play.

69
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,170
She's stomping her foot.

70
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,459
- [Isaac] Some of them
shoot higher than others.

71
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,626
The purple and the yellow.

72
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:16,182
- [Jeremy] Yay.

73
00:02:16,182 --> 00:02:17,528
- [Kendra] She's a little nervous.

74
00:02:17,528 --> 00:02:18,361
(Janae crying)

75
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,670
- [Jeremy] She's scared of it.

76
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,404
- She's a little scared of the toy.

77
00:02:21,404 --> 00:02:22,904
You almost got it.

78
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:26,586
(bright music)

79
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:28,641
There it goes.

80
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,862
- [Isaac] Now everybody's playing with it.

81
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,518
(Janae yelling)

82
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,743
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

83
00:02:36,743 --> 00:02:37,576
- I love this toy,

84
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,379
it brings back so many good memories.

85
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,319
- I wonder if we have any vlog footage

86
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,511
of this thing.

87
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,029
If you can find any vlog from our past

88
00:02:44,029 --> 00:02:45,676
that has this toy in it,

89
00:02:45,676 --> 00:02:47,852
let us know in the comments.

90
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:51,466
- Mom, did you think
that I would like this?

91
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:52,922
- I did think you would like this.

92
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,842
Do you like it?

93
00:02:53,842 --> 00:02:55,162
- Yeah.

94
00:02:55,162 --> 00:02:58,162
- [Kendra] Well that's a nice color.

95
00:03:00,028 --> 00:03:00,861
Wow.

96
00:03:01,754 --> 00:03:04,218
Laura, you're getting more make-up on?

97
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,754
We all go a little strong with the make-up

98
00:03:05,754 --> 00:03:06,908
when we start out.

99
00:03:06,908 --> 00:03:07,966
You all set?

100
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,078
- Mmm-hmm.

101
00:03:09,078 --> 00:03:12,825
(hammering)
(upbeat rock music)

102
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,922
- [Kendra] You got the first part open.

103
00:03:14,922 --> 00:03:16,886
Break it more, so it's
like more than half.

104
00:03:16,886 --> 00:03:17,888
Can you carry it down to the patio,

105
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,531
let's see if it works on the patio.

106
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:20,364
(hammering)

107
00:03:20,364 --> 00:03:21,458
Whoa.

108
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:23,805
- Now we'll actually see it.

109
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:27,138
- [Kendra] Whoa, that's really cool bud.

110
00:03:28,397 --> 00:03:30,241
- [Caleb] This was it.

111
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,740
- [Kendra] You're right, totally matches.

112
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,323
Oh Jeremy nice one.

113
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,055
What?
- And three.

114
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,039
(clicking)

115
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,067
- I can do this all day.

116
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,026
(hammering)

117
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:45,264
- Did it break in half?
- Yes.

118
00:03:45,264 --> 00:03:48,419
- [Kendra] Oh my
goodness, that is so cool.

119
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:49,460
Wow.

120
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,344
Okay now figure out which one that one is.

121
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:52,207
- I want to do it inside,

122
00:03:52,207 --> 00:03:54,481
because the light really helps.

123
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:57,432
So let's go.
- That's a good point.

124
00:03:57,432 --> 00:03:58,612
- So one of our kids got really excited

125
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:00,235
about their new cologne spray

126
00:04:00,235 --> 00:04:02,409
and they sprayed a ton

127
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,576
and it smells so strongly,

128
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:07,630
it's like permeating our whole house.

129
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,488
Even though it's like frigid cold out,

130
00:04:09,488 --> 00:04:10,770
we're opening up the windows,

131
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,129
we're all starting to get headaches.

132
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,144
It's a strong smell.

133
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:17,144
The kids are practicing.

134
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:21,037
Isaac, you're doing awesome.

135
00:04:21,038 --> 00:04:22,256
(knocking on floor)

136
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:24,552
You're getting it Caleb.

137
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:27,841
(lively ragtime music)

138
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:28,848
Laura came over with this plate,

139
00:04:28,848 --> 00:04:30,163
and she said Mom I've brought cookies

140
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:31,743
to help with lunch.

141
00:04:31,743 --> 00:04:34,291
- [Jeremy] Elise is using a pecante.

142
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,495
Alright, so now try to take off the shell.

143
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:38,550
- [Kendra] Elise is using the nutcracker.

144
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,196
(laughs)

145
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,779
- [Jeremy] Hey, Cubby's
gonna try a walnut.

146
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:46,174
- [Kendra] You need some help buddy?

147
00:04:46,174 --> 00:04:47,007
- [Jeremy] Not easy.

148
00:04:47,007 --> 00:04:47,929
- Can someone help me?

149
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,680
- [Jeremy] Mom's gonna help with this one.

150
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,966
- So as soon as you turn
it in the right direction,

151
00:04:51,966 --> 00:04:53,971
it cracks pretty easy.
- I need the little tools.

152
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:57,221
- [Kendra] Do you see the nut in there?

153
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,504
You got it Isaac.

154
00:05:02,935 --> 00:05:03,768
Ooh.

155
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,415
Looks like we're gonna
have to sweep after this.

156
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:07,714
What's that one?

157
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,926
- I thought it was an acorn.

158
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:10,759
It's an acorn.

159
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,355
- [Kendra] I didn't think we ate acorns.

160
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,720
- Maybe it's a hazelnut, I don't know.

161
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,798
- [Kendra] Maybe it's a macadamia nut?

162
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:18,631
- No.

163
00:05:19,603 --> 00:05:22,186
(car motoring)

164
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,857
A little more room for skating out here.

165
00:05:25,857 --> 00:05:27,937
(lively music)

166
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:28,770
- [Kendra] What?

167
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,603
They're going to town.

168
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,987
- [Jeremy] Good try bud.

169
00:05:34,987 --> 00:05:36,428
- Well the kids are still rollerskating

170
00:05:36,428 --> 00:05:37,709
in the garage, I think
we're gonna be lucky

171
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,733
to get Isaac to take his
rollerskates off ever.

172
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,270
He is absolutely loving this

173
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:43,229
and Elise is doing amazing.

174
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:44,789
It was sad a few minutes ago,

175
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:46,020
she just had her first fall,

176
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,614
where she really hurt.

177
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:50,285
And she came inside,

178
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:51,275
and then I was so surprised,

179
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:52,939
because just a few minutes later,

180
00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:55,172
I see her downstairs tying
back on her rollerskates.

181
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:56,153
I'm like you're going back out?

182
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,215
She's like yeah and now
she's going to town.

183
00:05:58,215 --> 00:05:59,720
So I'm proud of her, like getting back up

184
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,588
after you fall is never an easy thing.

185
00:06:01,588 --> 00:06:02,967
And it's just cool to see the kids

186
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:05,079
progressing with this skill.

187
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,912
And I was telling Jeremy,

188
00:06:05,912 --> 00:06:07,311
like I feel like our Christmas presents

189
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,458
expanded our house,

190
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,308
like we don't usually
hang out in our garage,

191
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:14,171
but now, yay, our garage
is like an extra room.

192
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:15,004
You guys are doing awesome.

193
00:06:15,004 --> 00:06:15,837
Are you liking it?

194
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:17,004
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

195
00:06:21,213 --> 00:06:23,876
- [Kendra] Trying their
new coding game with Osmo.

196
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:24,852
- I could live in these.

197
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,996
I can do everything.

198
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:28,605
I can go upstairs, I can go downstairs.

199
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,461
In a weird way.
- Whoa.

200
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:31,327
- [Kendra] In your rollerskates?

201
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:32,879
- I could crawl upstairs and

202
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:33,919
- [Kendra] Crawl downstairs?

203
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,804
- Scoot downstairs.

204
00:06:34,804 --> 00:06:35,637
- It's a rule.

205
00:06:35,637 --> 00:06:36,947
I won't let them walk
up and down the stairs

206
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:39,007
in the skates, so they sit on their bum

207
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,559
and go down, and go up.

208
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:44,330
So the first person to cover
up their whole board, wins.

209
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,297
You guys ready?

210
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:47,905
♪ We wish you a Merry Christmas ♪

211
00:06:47,905 --> 00:06:50,528

00:06:50,528 --> 00:06:53,098

♪ And a Happy New Year ♪

214
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:57,265
- [Jeremy] So what did you do?

215
00:06:57,265 --> 00:06:58,598
- I made a shop.

216
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:01,712
- [Jeremy] Is this your little rock shop?

217
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,045
- It's a museum.

218
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,826
And if you'd like to buy
anything, it's $2,000 dollars.

219
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:10,362
- [Jeremy] Oh.

220
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,112
- Put that somewhere.

221
00:07:14,405 --> 00:07:18,173
- I'm making my rankings
of the helmets in order.

222
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,923
First Patriots and a lot of them.

223
00:07:23,265 --> 00:07:24,429
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

224
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:27,001
- And the undecideds are still in that.

225
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:29,251
- [Jeremy] Are the
Cardinals not up there yet?

226
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:30,084
- Almost.

227
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:31,248
- [Jeremy] What?

228
00:07:31,248 --> 00:07:33,732
You eating cotton candy?

229
00:07:33,732 --> 00:07:35,593
- So Caleb wanted to know how this worked.

230
00:07:35,593 --> 00:07:38,093
So you hook it into the gears.

231
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:43,243
Caleb look, do you see that?

232
00:07:43,243 --> 00:07:44,076
- Whoa.

233
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,192
- [Kendra] It's like a Christmas wreath.

234
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:49,573
- [Caleb] Can I do it now?

235
00:07:49,573 --> 00:07:51,031
- [Kendra] Of course you can.

236
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:52,114
There you go.

237
00:07:53,427 --> 00:07:54,760
You're doing it.

238
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,900
Poll question, has Caleb been seen

239
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,722
in the vlog today without his headlamp on?

240
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:03,146
(Jeremy laughs)

241
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:05,035
He's been wearing it all day.

242
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,770
- Not an actual poll question,

243
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:07,603
but that's funny.

244
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,207
- Because everyone needs practice

245
00:08:09,207 --> 00:08:11,552
with their very best manners.

246
00:08:11,552 --> 00:08:12,385
Okay?

247
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:14,388
We have our nice bubbly drink.

248
00:08:14,388 --> 00:08:16,207
- I'm grateful for the food

249
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,997
that you could take your time to prepare.

250
00:08:19,997 --> 00:08:21,164
- Wow, thanks.

251
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:23,620
That was very eloquent.

252
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,613
- I am grateful that we had snow,

253
00:08:25,613 --> 00:08:28,356
because a white Christmas
is extra magical.

254
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:32,683
- I am grateful that we can have Christmas

255
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:33,850
and for Jesus.

256
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:38,477
- I am grateful for families

257
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:42,060
and that we can have
good couches and beds.

258
00:08:46,828 --> 00:08:48,514
- [Kendra] Whatcha feelin'
grateful for Nae Nae?

259
00:08:48,514 --> 00:08:50,859
- [Jeremy] I like crackers.

260
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,884
- I'm grateful for make-up.

261
00:08:52,884 --> 00:08:53,862
- Make-up.

262
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,055
I'm grateful for Kendra,

263
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,668
I think she did amazing with Christmas.

264
00:08:57,668 --> 00:08:58,676
She got deliberate gifts

265
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:02,126
that help and educate
and enrich our children

266
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,774
and she didn't overdo it.

267
00:09:03,774 --> 00:09:06,861
I think she did a great
amount of Christmas

268
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:09,348
for our kids, so thank you.

269
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,534
- [Kendra] That was good.

270
00:09:10,534 --> 00:09:11,701
- [Jeremy] To Christmas.

271
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,060
Cheers.
- To Christmas.

272
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:13,893
- Cheers.
- To Christmas.

273
00:09:13,893 --> 00:09:15,134
- Laura.

274
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:16,590
- I already did you.

275
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,942
- Me, cheers.
- Cheers.

276
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:21,098
- Got it.
- Cheers.

277
00:09:21,098 --> 00:09:22,684
- [Kendra] This is my
favorite present to give

278
00:09:22,684 --> 00:09:23,853
to little babies.

279
00:09:23,853 --> 00:09:24,853
- Thank you!

280
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:27,394
- Big present.

281
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:28,454
- Yeah!

282
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:29,609
- [Kendra] Guess what Isaac?

283
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:30,442
- What?

284
00:09:30,442 --> 00:00:00,000
("Jingle Bells")
