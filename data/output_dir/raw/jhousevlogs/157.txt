1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,974
(water bubbling)

2
00:00:01,974 --> 00:00:05,641
(bouncy instrumental music)

3
00:00:10,027 --> 00:00:11,860
- Sorry, we're closed.

4
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:16,478
- Well, this morning, I was
able to reunite with the kids.

5
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:19,247
They were excited to see
me, but they are much more

6
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:22,097
excited to see this little nugget of joy.

7
00:00:22,097 --> 00:00:22,930
(excited giggles)
- Hi.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:23,763
- Hi.

9
00:00:23,763 --> 00:00:24,596
- Hi.

10
00:00:24,596 --> 00:00:26,521
(excited giggles)

11
00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:27,354
- Mwah.

12
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:30,320
- She missed you guys.

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,073
So you guys, there were times
that she would be crying

14
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:33,983
and really upset, and we
would pull out a picture

15
00:00:33,983 --> 00:00:36,916
of you guys, and she would
just laugh and giggle

16
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:38,583
at it and calm down.

17
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,458
You reading the "juh-naenae?"

18
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:49,291
- Yeah.

19
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:52,505
- So while we were gone, my
mom was here with the kids.

20
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,293
And she taught them some more piano stuff.

21
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:56,577
(Chopsticks)

22
00:00:56,577 --> 00:00:59,327
(piano plunking)

23
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:11,713
Pretty good.

24
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:13,465
- [Granny Jo] Bum, bum bum.

25
00:01:13,465 --> 00:01:15,666
- So growing up, my mom
was a piano teacher,

26
00:01:15,666 --> 00:01:18,145
so we always had piano
going on in the background

27
00:01:18,145 --> 00:01:19,163
of my house.

28
00:01:19,163 --> 00:01:20,982
(piano plunking)

29
00:01:20,982 --> 00:01:21,815
- [Granny Jo] One, two,

30
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,648
three, four.

31
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,206
- [Jeremy] Nailed it!

32
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:25,924
- Wait 'til you hear Isaac.

33
00:01:25,924 --> 00:01:27,060
He can play this other part.

34
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,810
(piano plunking)

35
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,885
- One, two, three,

36
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,396
four, five, six

37
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:39,699
One, two, three

38
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:41,214
four, five, six.

39
00:01:41,214 --> 00:01:42,701
(piano plunking)
One, two, three,

40
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:44,340
four, five, six.

41
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,757
One, two, three--

42
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,221
- Hello, good to see you boys.

43
00:01:52,221 --> 00:01:53,321
We missed you.

44
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,542
- [Both] Patty cake, patty cake

45
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:55,889
baker's man,

46
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,901
bake me a cake as fast as you can.

47
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,401
Pat it and roll it

48
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,151
and mark it with a J

49
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:06,234
and throw it in the air

50
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:07,568
for Janae today.

51
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:08,423
- [Jeremy] Yay!

52
00:02:08,423 --> 00:02:09,256
- Ready?

53
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,457
This little piggy went to market.

54
00:02:10,457 --> 00:02:11,758
This little piggy stayed home.

55
00:02:11,758 --> 00:02:14,035
This little piggy had roast beef--

56
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,433
- So, we're doing a little hike
with Granny Jo this morning.

57
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:19,600
(gentle guitar music)

58
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:27,630
This is so cool.

59
00:02:28,503 --> 00:02:31,521
(water bubbling)

60
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:34,688
(gentle guitar music)

61
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,801
Can you skip some rocks?

62
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:44,636
(splash)

63
00:02:44,636 --> 00:02:47,204
- These ones make big splashes.

64
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,037
- [Jeremy] Yep.

65
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:51,061
- Okay, so a small, thin one.

66
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:53,241
Perfect!
- Yep, that's perfect.

67
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,074
(splash)

68
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:56,501
- This is flat.
- Yeah, that's perfect.

69
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,972
- [Jeremy] Good job, it's
just like throwin' a frisbee.

70
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,222
That was close.

71
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:01,001
(splash)

72
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:02,668
- I hope this works.

73
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:06,971
- [Jeremy] Hey, it did
a little bit (giggles).

74
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,638
(upbeat instrumental music)

75
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:22,352
That was like five.

76
00:03:22,352 --> 00:03:24,270
Be very careful, Isaac.

77
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,079
(screams excitedly)

78
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:30,746
(upbeat instrumental music)

79
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:34,627
- Bye bye.
- Well, it's time

80
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:35,905
to say goodbye.

81
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:37,165
- Mwah.

82
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:38,676
Goodbye Isaac.

83
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,670
- [Laura] I don't wanna get out.

84
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,625
- Okay, you guys gotta
practice your piano, right?

85
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:43,458
- Mm hmm.

86
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,291
Yeah.
- Yeah.

87
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:47,031
- And you're gonna work
on your violin, right?

88
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:48,461
You're gonna work on your gymnastics?

89
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:50,169
- We're so grateful to have
grandparents that can watch

90
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,018
the kids when we're gone because
it just makes it so lovely

91
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:54,614
for the kids and for us.

92
00:03:54,614 --> 00:03:56,168
(lawnmower puttering)

93
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,501
♫ I see you

94
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:06,871
♫ I see you

95
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,637
Nothing says "Welcome home
from vacation" like doing

96
00:04:10,637 --> 00:04:13,460
four loads of laundry, but
that's what I did already today.

97
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:16,531
We, as a family, are now
going to fold four loads

98
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:17,471
of laundry.

99
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:19,701
The question is, how
long is it gonna take us?

100
00:04:19,702 --> 00:04:21,468
Put your guesses down
in the comments below.

101
00:04:21,468 --> 00:04:23,158
We are gonna time ourselves.

102
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,566
Let's do this.

103
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:25,982
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

104
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,742
- [All] J House!

105
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:28,876
- [Kendra] Let's do this!

106
00:04:28,876 --> 00:04:31,676
♫ I got that sunshine in my pocket

107
00:04:31,676 --> 00:04:33,786
♫ I got that good song in my feet

108
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:37,453
(upbeat instrumental music)

109
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:52,793
Well, the boys are pretty excited today.

110
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,709
- Tell 'em what we're doin'.

111
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:55,708
- We're doin' Fantasy Football.

112
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:56,861
- This is Isaac's first time.

113
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,320
We're doin' the draft right now.

114
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,844
- [Kendra] It's gonna be a fun season.

115
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:00,800
How many weeks is it?

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,978
- It's 13 weeks until the
playoffs, and then you

117
00:05:02,978 --> 00:05:04,578
do a play off round.

118
00:05:04,578 --> 00:05:05,475
- [Kendra] Well, go team.

119
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:06,866
Did you get your top player?

120
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:09,463
- No, you have to get the
first pick because everyone

121
00:05:09,463 --> 00:05:10,770
was goin' for him.

122
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,603
- [Kendra] Got it.

123
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:14,040
- So, there's 12 teams
and it's all my family.

124
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,284
My brothers, my dad,

125
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:17,158
my family,
- Nephews.

126
00:05:17,158 --> 00:05:18,422
- yeah, nephews.

127
00:05:18,422 --> 00:05:19,927
So it's super fun.

128
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:21,518
We're all trash talkin' each other.

129
00:05:21,518 --> 00:05:23,308
- They're goin' down.

130
00:05:23,308 --> 00:05:24,862
- [Kendra] Caleb, are you on dad's team?

131
00:05:24,862 --> 00:05:26,004
- He's my helper.

132
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:28,048
- It's my turn.

133
00:05:28,048 --> 00:05:30,292
I'm gonna go with Derek Carr.

134
00:05:30,292 --> 00:05:32,165
- Derek Carr?

135
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,486
- He's gettin' a quarterback.

136
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,212
Good choice.
(computer chimes)

137
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:37,045
- Daddy it's our turn.

138
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:37,927
- It's my turn.

139
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,637
Let's see, so I have like a
cheat sheet that I can look at

140
00:05:39,637 --> 00:05:42,002
that kinda shows me the value of people.

141
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,142
I don't have it all memorized.

142
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:43,975
- [Kendra] Like Isaac.

143
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:44,808
- Yeah.

144
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:46,896
(computer chimes)
Did you just draft a player?

145
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:48,813
- Yeah.
- Good job.

146
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,318
So we're getting pictures in from all over

147
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:52,149
the different places where our family

148
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,698
is doing Fantasy Football.

149
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:55,488
It's just fun to see that
we're all doing this together

150
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:57,122
and being able to interact in this way.

151
00:05:57,122 --> 00:05:59,322
And Isaac was really the
one who spawned this.

152
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,220
He wanted
- Yeah.

153
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,864
to do Fantasy Football,
he's been asking for years.

154
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:04,579
And so everyone agreed to do it

155
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:05,870
because Isaac really wanted it.

156
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:06,703
- Yeah.

157
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:08,066
- [Kendra] So I bet you
wish you could do a draft

158
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:09,127
every single day.

159
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,317
- Oh yes!

160
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:11,742
- [Kendra] That would be pretty cool.

161
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:12,680
(chuckles)

162
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,470
Check out this hat.

163
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,787
I got it at Playlist and
Jeremy actually got it,

164
00:06:16,787 --> 00:06:18,622
and then I tried it on
and I really like it.

165
00:06:18,622 --> 00:06:20,939
And he was so sweet,
he's letting me wear it.

166
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:23,591
- I think that you're hot with a hat on.

167
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:24,934
I hope you wear it every day.

168
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,564
- Make videos every day.

169
00:06:26,564 --> 00:06:27,870
So it's a YouTube hat.

170
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:30,284
We are headed to Lelo's
which is the shaved ice place

171
00:06:30,284 --> 00:06:31,424
that we've been going this summer.

172
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,415
It's the last day that they're open.

173
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:34,248
- [Jeremy] Boo.

174
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:35,081
- They're closing.

175
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:37,451
So we have to go and get our last fix.

176
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:39,971
So Jeremy forgot his wallet
and I don't have my wallet

177
00:06:39,971 --> 00:06:42,415
in the diaper bag yet from
our trip that we just went on

178
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:44,166
'cause I don't take it on trips.

179
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:45,834
So we pull up, we unload
the kids, we're like,

180
00:06:45,834 --> 00:06:47,507
"No, we're gonna have to go home!"

181
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,623
But I dug down to the bottom
of my purse and I keep

182
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:53,368
an emergency 20 in there
for just such times as this.

183
00:06:53,368 --> 00:06:54,795
And then we found a
few dollars in the car,

184
00:06:54,795 --> 00:06:57,652
so we cannot go over $24.

185
00:06:57,652 --> 00:06:59,246
- They don't have shaved ice.

186
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:00,079
- [Kendra] What?

187
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:01,486
- They don't have shaved ice.

188
00:07:01,486 --> 00:07:04,159
- [Kendra] They don't have any shaved ice?

189
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,437
Laura, you're right.

190
00:07:05,437 --> 00:07:07,393
So Makayla says they really
don't have shaved ice.

191
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:08,251
- Yeah, we ran out.

192
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:09,556
There was so many people.

193
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:10,389
- [Kendra] Oh no!

194
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,222
Do you still have soda?

195
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,055
- Yes.

196
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:12,888
- [Kendra] And ice cream?

197
00:07:12,888 --> 00:07:13,721
- Yes.

198
00:07:13,721 --> 00:07:14,554
- [Kendra] Yay, floats it is!

199
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:16,565
- Yay, I can have a root beer!

200
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,600
- Well, with it being closing
day today, it was so crazy

201
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,473
busy that they did run out of shaved ice.

202
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:22,675
But they have sodas, which was
my favorite treat all summer,

203
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:25,163
so I'm actually still
really thrilled about this.

204
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,835
So, we're gonna do root
beer floats with our kids.

205
00:07:26,835 --> 00:07:29,325
But root beer with
coconut flavoring in it?

206
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,710
- The thing I love most
about Lilo's though,

207
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,010
we just talked with the
owner, and the husband is

208
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,009
in dental school, the wife is a blogger,

209
00:07:36,009 --> 00:07:38,668
and they're just entrepreneurs
and they have that spirit

210
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,048
of creating something.

211
00:07:40,048 --> 00:07:41,149
And I wanna support that.
- And they did it

212
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:42,005
so well.

213
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,264
It's just been wonderful.

214
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:44,680
Okay, we better order our
food or we're gonna lose

215
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,698
our place in line.

216
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:49,281
(happy instrumental music)

217
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:52,984
- [Isaac] I love this soda.

218
00:07:52,984 --> 00:07:53,901
- Mm mm mm.

219
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:56,907
- [Jeremy] So, last day of work

220
00:07:56,907 --> 00:07:59,324
at Lilo's.
- Yeah, kinda sad.

221
00:08:00,638 --> 00:08:03,471
- But she's busy with high school.

222
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,573
(grunts)

223
00:08:05,573 --> 00:08:06,406
- [Girl] Now pull it out.

224
00:08:06,406 --> 00:08:07,589
- [Jeremy] This is like the
opposite of a ribbon cutting.

225
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,950
You're shutting 'em down.

226
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,235
- Sorry, we're closed.

227
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:14,028
- J House out.

228
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,819
- [Kendra] Janae's learning a new game.

229
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:17,661
- [Jeremy] Peek-a-boo!

230
00:08:17,661 --> 00:00:00,000
(percussive music)
