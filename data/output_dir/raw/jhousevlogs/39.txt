1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,015
- [Jeremy] It's gonna be a little loud.

2
00:00:03,015 --> 00:00:04,212
Whoa.

3
00:00:04,212 --> 00:00:07,500
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,333
- Oh, wow.

5
00:00:09,644 --> 00:00:10,916
- [Kendra] Yeah, show
us your best fish face.

6
00:00:10,916 --> 00:00:14,261
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:16,937
- It looks like a castle,
and you can go in it!

8
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:19,520
(upbeat music)

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,010
- So this morning we
are going to brunch at

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,320
The Marine Room, which this
place, when Jeremy and I

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,720
were researching like, fun
and unique things to do

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,550
in San Diego, we heard about it.

13
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,730
And it's a restaurant that's
out like, on the water.

14
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,210
Like, the waves crash against
it while you're eating.

15
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,370
And we found out that
just a couple times a year

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,000
they do a high tide
breakfast, and it is happening

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,833
while we're here.

18
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,550
So we made reservations,
and we've been really

19
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,750
looking forward to it.

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,530
Unfortunately, Jeremy
doesn't get to join us

21
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,100
'cause we don't have the baby
sitter situation figured out.

22
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,490
Instead, I've got Isaac, and Elyse.

23
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,970
You guys ready for this?

24
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,710
- [Children] Yep!
(classical music)

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,450
- [Kendra] We are right on the water.

26
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,473
This is cool.

27
00:00:56,473 --> 00:01:00,110
(classical music)

28
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,393
So you guys look at what
you wanna have in it, okay?

29
00:01:02,393 --> 00:01:05,226
(classical music)

30
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,690
- I never had a omelet before.

31
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,430
I'm really excited.

32
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,263
(classical music)

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,972
- [Kendra] French toast.

34
00:01:25,972 --> 00:01:28,805
(classical music)

35
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,620
It's kind of a big plate, huh?

36
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,830
You're doing a great job.

37
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,040
You always use the outside fork first.

38
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,893
(upbeat music)

39
00:01:46,946 --> 00:01:48,000
Was that one pretty good?

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,868
- Yeah.

41
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:51,451
(upbeat music)

42
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:55,470
- So we decided to all try
something new from the buffet,

43
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,880
and this is definitely new.

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,760
This is an Eggs Benedict, this
is a Goat Cheese Frittata,

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,450
and this is called a Stone Fruit Blintz.

46
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,946
Isaac went with the Smoked Salmon.

47
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:09,276
- And that salad.

48
00:02:09,276 --> 00:02:10,739
- Yeah.

49
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,960
- Potato salad.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,480
And, then...

51
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,289
I don't know what that is.

52
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:16,716
And this is egg plant.

53
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:21,716
- [Kendra] Egg Plant Escabeche.

54
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,913
- Mm.
- Pretty good?

55
00:02:24,913 --> 00:02:27,496
(upbeat music)

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,353
I'm full.

57
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,480
It's always so sad to be
full at a buffet because

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,369
there's still so much good food out there.

59
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:40,510
- So the ocean looks like
there's nothing in it,

60
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,492
but there's actually a whole world in it.

61
00:02:43,492 --> 00:02:44,982
- [Kendra] Isn't that amazing?

62
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:46,906
- Uh-huh.
- Cheers!

63
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:51,080
Cheers.

64
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,990
- Can we get dessert for this round?

65
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,320
- Yes we can.

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,580
So there's brunch, and
there's dessert, and I was

67
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,590
telling Isaac, I don't
know if I can eat dessert

68
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,430
this early in the day.

69
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,263
And he was so smart.

70
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,310
He said, well Mom, we ate
three rounds at the buffet,

71
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,710
so pretty much that's
like three meals, so now

72
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,200
it's time for dessert.

73
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,320
Isaac chose a Passion Fruit Bar.

74
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,240
Elyse chose Dulce De
Leche, and Mystery Dish.

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,140
We don't know what's in it.

76
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,920
So we each picked two desserts
so we can taste them all.

77
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,753
- This is so good.

78
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:16,830
It's almost like vanilla ice cream.

79
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,730
- [Kendra] So it's called Panna Cotta.

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,556
(classical music)

81
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:24,880
Well the High Tide
breakfast was really fun.

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,530
Unfortunately, the waves
weren't very strong today,

83
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,150
and several people were
commenting on that.

84
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,020
They're like, the waves are just low, so.

85
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,430
We've seen online and heard
that like, the waves crashed

86
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,560
against the window.

87
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,360
We didn't see too much of that,
but the food was wonderful,

88
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,760
and I was really impressed with
how Isaac and Elyse behaved.

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,370
It was exciting for me
to be able to share that

90
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,270
with the kids.

91
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,610
Now we are home.

92
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,440
We're stuffed, and we're ready to begin

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,838
our day's adventures.

94
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:49,630
(dramatic music)

95
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,180
So, we can't find the house key.

96
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,840
I know I had it.

97
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
- [Jeremy] Not here.

98
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,760
Okay you guys, we're looking for the key.

99
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,290
Anyone know where it might be?

100
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,340
- [Children] No.

101
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,520
- [Jeremy] I think they're ready.

102
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,353
- I found it.

103
00:04:02,353 --> 00:04:03,186
- [Jeremy] Where was it?

104
00:04:03,186 --> 00:04:05,210
- In the dark crevices of the diaper bag.

105
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,650
We got it, dude. We found it.

106
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,112
Ready to go?
- Let's do it.

107
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:14,529
(upbeat bluegrass music)

108
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:19,485
- I brought my potato rock and it's safe.

109
00:04:20,623 --> 00:04:22,146
- [Kendra] Such a good
job. You keep that safe.

110
00:04:22,146 --> 00:04:25,563
(upbeat bluegrass music)

111
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,210
Today's destination is
the Air and Space Museum.

112
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,474
[Jeremy] Whoa.

113
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,320
- By Ryan Aeronautical.

114
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:55,940
It was a...

115
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,589
- [Jeremy] See this actor?

116
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,922
- [Children] Hi!

117
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:02,972
- Boom. New York City.

118
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,500
How 'bout FRA?

119
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,535
- [Child] France.

120
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:07,790
- France, oh, it's Frankfurt!
- Frankfurt.

121
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,703
- You think that one's Seattle?

122
00:05:09,703 --> 00:05:11,494
Toronto.
- Toronto.

123
00:05:11,494 --> 00:05:12,327
- SJD.

124
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,100
San Jose, Del Cabo, Mexico.

125
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,410
The story of flight begins
with Leonardo Da Vinci.

126
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,440
Adventures of the airplane.

127
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,165
Orville and Wibur Wright.

128
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:24,748
(upbeat music)

129
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,190
- What's a glider?

130
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,120
- [Jeremy] That's where
it doesn't have an engine,

131
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,587
and it just glides in the air.

132
00:05:30,587 --> 00:05:33,170
(upbeat music)

133
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:42,730
- Look, this is what flight
attendants use to look like.

134
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,592
Pacific Southwest Reservations.

135
00:05:45,592 --> 00:05:48,175
(upbeat music)

136
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,070
- So they have a movie
theater here with seats

137
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,230
that move and vibrate.

138
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,630
You nervous?
- Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,030
It's gonna be a little loud.

140
00:06:07,217 --> 00:06:08,050
- Whoa!

141
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,278
(laughs)

142
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:10,828
That was like a roller coaster.

143
00:06:14,365 --> 00:06:16,040
- [Kendra] Elyse isn't quite tall enough

144
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,500
to reach the pedals.

145
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,707
- I figured out how to make it start.

146
00:06:19,707 --> 00:06:23,691
- [Kendra] So there's foot pedals.

147
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,274
(upbeat music)

148
00:06:42,683 --> 00:06:44,190
- It's harder than it looks.

149
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,510
I'm not a very good pilot.

150
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,469
- You're just in training.

151
00:06:47,469 --> 00:06:48,667
- Oh look, I got an airplane.

152
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,250
(upbeat music)

153
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:00,170
- Put it back up there.

154
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,585
Look at that Nae-nae

155
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:04,168
(upbeat music)

156
00:07:10,102 --> 00:07:13,330
- Hi Nae-nae. Hi big girl!

157
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,163
Ooh!

158
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,850
Amelia Earhart.

159
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,840
So Elyse just finished reading
a book about Amelia Earhart,

160
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,607
so she was excited to
see a plane replica here.

161
00:07:22,607 --> 00:07:25,190
(bright music)

162
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,360
- So they have some
documentaries going here about

163
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,930
World War Two, and about
space flight, and I could

164
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,940
watch those forever.

165
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,240
Like, I am the biggest nerd.

166
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,950
I love learning and I love
watching about the stories

167
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,950
of things that happened.

168
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,440
Let me know in the poll if
you also like documentaries.

169
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,820
- So apparently, flaghoist
signally is a thing.

170
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,020
I had no idea.

171
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,840
So there's a whole international
code where they use

172
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,760
different flags to send
different messages.

173
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,540
And so the kids are
looking at the messages

174
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,360
that are out here, and
trying to decode 'em.

175
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,540
- Messages are sent by varying

176
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,420
the relative position of
the flags on a flag hoist.

177
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,000
- I think that one's it.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,280
I think it's...

179
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,230
- [Jeremy] Jenae was gonna be done, so.

180
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,925
Kendra made a roller coaster for her.

181
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:26,609
- I'm getting dizzy though.

182
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:28,776
(babbles)

183
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:32,169
(giggles)

184
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,808
(squeals)

185
00:08:34,808 --> 00:08:38,549
(squeals)
- Oh.

186
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,859
- A flight simulator.

187
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,709
(bright music)

188
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,880
- So while we were in the
museum, we met a World War Two

189
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,690
vet who was a medic at
the Battle of Normandy.

190
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,760
And it was just an honor
to hear his stories

191
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,960
and to thank him for his service.

192
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,690
There's just not a lot of
World War Two vets left.

193
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,570
And I think that there's a lot of lessons

194
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,270
that need to be learned from then.

195
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:08,210
- So we're taking a break
from our adventures,

196
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,510
and we're eating some waffles.

197
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,490
I heard that there was a
really cool like, Belgian

198
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,310
street waffle place really
close to Balboa Park,

199
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:15,190
so we're gonna eat there.

200
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:17,730
- So we couldn't find this
place when we first drove by.

201
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,750
It looks like a total hole
in the wall, but I think

202
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,557
it's nicer than it
appears from the drive by.

203
00:09:23,557 --> 00:09:26,570
(upbeat music)

204
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,611
How did we miss it?

205
00:09:27,611 --> 00:09:30,194
(upbeat music)

206
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:37,804
It's good.

207
00:09:37,804 --> 00:09:39,650
Lemonade with pineapple and strawberry.

208
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,000
- How did you guys like, make all that?

209
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,060
- Everything was made by hand.

210
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,605
So we made all the tables.

211
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:48,188
(upbeat music)

212
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,680
- Oh wow.

213
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,860
- Is it good?
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,693
- [Jeremy] Hi.

215
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,309
She's waving.

216
00:09:55,309 --> 00:09:57,610
(upbeat music)

217
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:00,330
- So this place has definitely
been a happy surprise.

218
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,460
It's so unique.

219
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,800
See their chairs?

220
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,990
So, how's seat number four?

221
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,280
- Good.

222
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,902
- [Jeremy] Just for four year olds, right?

223
00:10:06,902 --> 00:10:09,485
(upbeat music)

224
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,460
(upbeat country music)

225
00:10:28,476 --> 00:10:29,760
Who wants to go in here?

226
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,844
- [Child] Yeah.

227
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:34,094
(upbeat country music)

228
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,680
- So we found a Japanese
friendship garden here

229
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,480
in Balboa Park that we're checking out.

230
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,813
(gentle oriental music)

231
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,328
- That fish was going mwah.

232
00:10:54,328 --> 00:10:55,248
- [Jeremy] Was it kissing?

233
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:57,320
- Yeah.
(kissing noises)

234
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,153
- [Kendra] Show us your best fish face.

235
00:10:59,364 --> 00:11:00,260
- There it is.
- Let's see Isaac's.

236
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,240
- I just lost it.

237
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,070
- [Jeremy] Don't smile.

238
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:06,850
(laughs)

239
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:07,683
- Okay, my turn.

240
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,629
(laughs)

241
00:11:15,654 --> 00:11:18,237
(bright music)

242
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:24,000
- They have bonsai trees here.

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
These trees are very old and very special.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
Be very careful with them.

245
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,494
Whenever I see bonsai trees,
I always think of Karate Kid.

246
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:40,930
- Hey, look at that.
It's gonna make it, huh?

247
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,700
- Ay. Make it because have strong root.

248
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:48,490
- These are like miniature trees.

249
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,800
- These would be good
climbing trees if they were

250
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,300
just a lot bigger.

251
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,410
- [Kendra] This one is my favorite.

252
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,243
It's just beautiful.

253
00:11:55,243 --> 00:11:56,970
- [Jeremy] I think this one's my favorite.

254
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,920
It reminds me of an overgrown broccoli.

255
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,670
And the Karate Kid.

256
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,190
- Bonsai Danielson.

257
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,656
- Eh, bonsai!

258
00:12:04,656 --> 00:12:07,025
- Bonsai!
- Bonsai!

259
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:11,942
♪ That one is my favorite
of all my heart. ♪

260
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,650
- This one's my favorite.

261
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,120
- [Jeremy] Why do you like it so much?

262
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,443
- Because it's big.

263
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:22,693
(upbeat country music)

264
00:12:28,069 --> 00:12:30,980
- It must be very old, but
they had to cut it down.

265
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,020
It is an interesting thing
that they cut it down.

266
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,470
- [Kendra] Yeah, there
must have been a reason.

267
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:37,473
It's really pretty.

268
00:12:37,473 --> 00:12:40,723
(upbeat country music)

269
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,010
- I typically would never
stop and read plaques.

270
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,640
Kendra almost always does.

271
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,750
And while it takes longer,
we learn a lot more stuff.

272
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,820
- So this is a stone
lantern that used to be

273
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,406
used in Hindu temples.

274
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,989
(upbeat music)

275
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,070
- Well we made it outta the
garden and then realized

276
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,480
that Jenae was missing
one of her transparent

277
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,230
flip flop slipper things.

278
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Sandals, I think is what they're called.

279
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,532
So I'm gonna try to find it.

280
00:13:37,532 --> 00:13:40,115
(gentle music)

281
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,150
Well I guess Jenae is gonna
grow out of those sandals

282
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,260
before we find them.

283
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,832
Bummer.

284
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:50,415
(gentle music)

285
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,278
- This place is beautiful at night.

286
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:57,990
(gentle upbeat music)

287
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:00,290
- That reminds me of the Arc De Triomphe.

288
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,993
- In France?
- Yeah.

289
00:14:01,993 --> 00:14:02,850
- [Kendra] It's definitely an arch.

290
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,430
The one in France is much bigger.

291
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:06,820
(gentle upbeat music)

292
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:09,520
- It looks like a castle,
and you can go in it.

293
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,695
- [Kendra] Let's go see what it is.

294
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:13,862
(gentle upbeat music)

295
00:14:14,756 --> 00:14:16,228
- [Child] Good night.

296
00:14:16,228 --> 00:14:17,061
J House out.

297
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,160
- [Child] It moved on me!

298
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,194
It moved!

299
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,380
(laughs)
It moved!

300
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:26,525
- Is the tide coming in?
- Yeah!

301
00:14:26,525 --> 00:00:00,000
(dramatic music)
