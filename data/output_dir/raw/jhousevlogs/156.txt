1
00:00:00,822 --> 00:00:02,679
- We just had a really,
really scary experience

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:04,699
in the parking lot.

3
00:00:04,699 --> 00:00:07,282
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,506 --> 00:00:10,839
One, two, three.

5
00:00:15,822 --> 00:00:17,795
- [Jeremy] Isaac,

6
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:20,698
gotta get up, we have school today.

7
00:00:20,698 --> 00:00:23,281
(guitar music)

8
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,176
Elise,

9
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:29,568
come on we gotta get up.

10
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:31,008
Let's come do breakfast.

11
00:00:31,008 --> 00:00:32,470
So the first thing this morning

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,536
before anyone was awake,
Caleb climbed up into our bed.

13
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,834
He had his hair done, his clothes were on,

14
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:41,503
his bed was made and what did you tell us?

15
00:00:41,503 --> 00:00:43,618
- That I was excited for school

16
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:45,848
so I wanted to get ready quick.

17
00:00:45,848 --> 00:00:50,015
- He is super excited for his
first day of kindergarten.

18
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,122
We homeschool our kids but one day a week

19
00:00:54,122 --> 00:00:55,840
they go to a homeschool enrichment program

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,372
which is like a day of school.

21
00:00:57,372 --> 00:00:59,927
They have their teachers
and their classmates

22
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:01,900
of about 20 kids in each class.

23
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,270
They take their lunches.

24
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,221
And we love that they get
to have that experience

25
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,030
of going to school for
that one day a week.

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,613
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:30,822
(indiscernible singing)

28
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:48,410
- What are we having
today for lunch at school?

29
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,198
- [Jeremy] Do you wanna
help me put it together?

30
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:51,220
Okay, come on over.

31
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,803
(upbeat music)

32
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,693
So Elise how are you
feeling about the first day

33
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:01,878
at school?

34
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:04,014
- I feel very excited.

35
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,150
- [Jeremy] Which class are
you most excited about today?

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,400
- Spanish, it's my first class and art.

37
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:12,559
They do something cool.

38
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:14,509
- This is my own backpack.

39
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,342
- [Jeremy] Did you do your own hair Laura?

40
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:19,130
Let's maybe go talk to Mom about maybe her

41
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,630
just tweeking it a little bit.

42
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:24,587
- Okay.

43
00:02:24,587 --> 00:02:25,957
- Getting your hair done.

44
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:26,790
Yep.

45
00:02:27,837 --> 00:02:31,433
You excited to go to your
preschool class today?

46
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:32,711
- Yeah.

47
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:34,544
Hey that looks pretty.

48
00:02:35,868 --> 00:02:37,192
- Do you have your shoes on?

49
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,353
- Yep and yep.

50
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:41,000
Even I got my backpack on.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
- I was gonna do pigtails like this.

52
00:02:45,853 --> 00:02:47,316
- One, two, three,

53
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,233
four, five.

54
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,291
(guitar music)

55
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:56,743
- You mix it up with the dry hair?

56
00:02:56,743 --> 00:02:58,076
That is so cool.

57
00:02:59,948 --> 00:03:01,178
- There you go, all set.

58
00:03:01,178 --> 00:03:02,261
You all done?

59
00:03:03,105 --> 00:03:04,708
You get some pigtails.

60
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:07,192
Turn around, let's see 'em.

61
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,307
She was so excited.

62
00:03:08,307 --> 00:03:09,746
Oops, they're not super even.

63
00:03:09,746 --> 00:03:11,023
They look great Laura.

64
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,579
- I like my hair down.

65
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:14,112
- [Kendra] So we just
curled it a little bit?

66
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:16,410
It looks super nice,
you ready for the day?

67
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,362
- Yep.

68
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:18,361
- [Kendra] Let's do this.

69
00:03:18,361 --> 00:03:19,917
- Me and Isaac actually
have the same backpack

70
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:22,471
and lunchbox but mine is a girl version

71
00:03:22,471 --> 00:03:24,932
and Isaac's is a boy version.

72
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,488
- [Kendra] So they're different colors.

73
00:03:26,488 --> 00:03:27,765
Cool.

74
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:28,787
- [Jeremy] So how are you feeling

75
00:03:28,787 --> 00:03:29,971
about the first day of school?

76
00:03:29,971 --> 00:03:31,706
- I'm excited, it's fun

77
00:03:31,706 --> 00:03:34,183
and I like to meet my new classmates.

78
00:03:34,183 --> 00:03:35,646
- [Jeremy] So what classes do you have?

79
00:03:35,646 --> 00:03:37,690
- I have computer, Spanish,

80
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,023
science, music, PE, and art.

81
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,586
- [Jeremy] And which class
are you most excited about?

82
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:47,837
- Computer because it's my
first time doing computers.

83
00:03:47,837 --> 00:03:49,462
I am really excited to see my

84
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:53,804
friends from class that
I knew from last year.

85
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:55,871
- [Kendra] Alright, we're
headed into classes.

86
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:57,148
How are you guys feeling?

87
00:03:57,148 --> 00:03:58,648
- Great.
- Excited.

88
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:00,979
- It was hard for me
to get out of the car.

89
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,953
- [Kendra] Yeah, with your big backpack?

90
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:05,925
- Yeah, I'm not used this big backpack.

91
00:04:05,925 --> 00:04:07,295
- [Kendra] The drive
over the kids are just

92
00:04:07,295 --> 00:04:10,360
chatting all about their
teachers and their classes.

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,659
I think they're gonna have a great day.

94
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,122
Isaac, what's your first class?

95
00:04:14,122 --> 00:04:15,143
- Music.

96
00:04:15,143 --> 00:04:16,142
- [Kendra] Music.

97
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:17,117
Is this is?

98
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:17,950
High five.

99
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:21,714
- Bye Isaac, see you some other time.

100
00:04:21,714 --> 00:04:24,215
(piano music)

101
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,427
- [Kendra] You excited
to meet you friends?

102
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:28,260
- Yeah.

103
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,281
- [Kendra] Where's your classroom?

104
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:32,373
- Right there.

105
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,602
- [Kendra] Good memory.

106
00:04:34,602 --> 00:04:36,390
- So when it's time for lunch
you'll come to your backpack.

107
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,922
- Then my snack is right there.

108
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:40,662
- [Kendra] What letter are
you learning about today?

109
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:41,893
- A.

110
00:04:41,893 --> 00:04:44,424
- [Kendra] The letter A.

111
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:45,515
- Because that.

112
00:04:45,515 --> 00:04:46,885
- [Kendra] Okay buddy have a good day.

113
00:04:46,885 --> 00:04:49,302
Can I have a hug before I go?

114
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:56,579
I'll miss you buddy, have a good day okay?

115
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,622
- Okay bye.
- Listen to your teacher.

116
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,085
Alright, what's your first class?

117
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:01,200
- Spanish.

118
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,895
- [Kendra] Are you excited about it?

119
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,938
Say something in Spanish for me.

120
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:05,890
- Adios.

121
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,330
- [Kendra] Adios.

122
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,700
Bye.

123
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,232
- I need a hug from Jenae too.

124
00:05:10,232 --> 00:05:13,553
- [Kendra] You need a hug from Jenae.

125
00:05:13,553 --> 00:05:15,433
- I'm gonna miss you.

126
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,966
- [Kendra] Oh you got it.

127
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:18,847
Were you stuck?
- Yeah.

128
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,310
- [Kendra] Laura couldn't get outta the

129
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,680
bathroom stall for a little bit.

130
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,212
Okay should we wash those hands?

131
00:05:23,212 --> 00:05:24,582
Well dropping them off
I feel nothing but joy.

132
00:05:24,582 --> 00:05:27,299
It's interesting I mean this is our

133
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,017
third, fourth year homeschooling

134
00:05:29,017 --> 00:05:30,875
and I'm just so grateful that
they have this opportunity.

135
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:33,197
I'm grateful that they're
home most of the time

136
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,031
and we'll get to do so much as a family.

137
00:05:35,031 --> 00:05:37,121
I'm really grateful they get to come here

138
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,746
and experience this as well.

139
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:40,952
It's a really great mix for our family

140
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:42,160
and it just works.

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,506
I know other years when I've left I felt

142
00:05:43,506 --> 00:05:45,225
a little bit emotional leaving them.

143
00:05:45,225 --> 00:05:47,872
But this year, I feel great about it.

144
00:05:47,872 --> 00:05:50,170
They're gonna be having
such great learning

145
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:54,002
opportunities with friends and
teachers who care about them.

146
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:55,975
I know they're in a
safe place where they're

147
00:05:55,975 --> 00:05:58,112
gonna be loved and
nurtured while I'm away.

148
00:05:58,112 --> 00:05:59,900
I just had a really, really

149
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,036
scary experience in the parking lot.

150
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:04,079
I was walking with just Laura and Jenae.

151
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:06,564
I have my diaper bag and
I'm holding Jenae in my arms

152
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,280
and I was getting the
keys outta my pocket.

153
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,788
So my hands were very full.

154
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:16,037
I tripped on a stick, it was a
big stick in the parking lot.

155
00:06:16,037 --> 00:06:17,787
I couldn't see it and

156
00:06:18,754 --> 00:06:20,542
it was so scary and I know
tripping doesn't sound scary

157
00:06:20,542 --> 00:06:23,445
but I was holding my baby.

158
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:27,740
Anyway, I fell over and my
ankle rolled pretty badly.

159
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:32,500
The way that I stumbled, I
was able to keep Jenae safe

160
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,706
and kind of regain my
balance at the last minute.

161
00:06:34,706 --> 00:06:36,517
I could have dropped my baby.

162
00:06:36,517 --> 00:06:39,838
It makes me wanna just use the stroller

163
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:41,788
when I have that much in
my hands or something.

164
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:43,538
Or wear better shoes.

165
00:06:46,665 --> 00:06:48,615
You ready for preschool?

166
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,496
Well the car went from being super loud

167
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:53,747
and mass chaos to just really quiet.

168
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,208
So Jenae's sleeping and
we're gonna go home.

169
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,275
I'm gonna try to get some stuff done.

170
00:06:58,275 --> 00:07:02,106
I can't believe it, I just have one kid.

171
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:05,273
Oh my goodness, you're trying so hard.

172
00:07:06,123 --> 00:07:07,873
Good job, you did it.

173
00:07:09,188 --> 00:07:11,231
Okay so she can kind of
get around a little bit

174
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:12,601
and I don't know whether to call it,

175
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:16,177
I mean she's obviously not
crawling but she's moving.

176
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,710
Was that a first knee forward?

177
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:19,080
I think I might have to watch this back

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,053
in slow motion, zoom in.

179
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,470
(epic music)

180
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,690
It's so amazing to watch the process

181
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,826
of a kid learning how to do something.

182
00:07:32,826 --> 00:07:35,891
To see each little movement forward

183
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:37,609
and to see what she's learning

184
00:07:37,609 --> 00:07:39,560
and she's experiencing it all.

185
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,533
It's fun to watch kids learn.

186
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:44,529
Here you go, you've tried so hard.

187
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:46,317
You've been working so hard.

188
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:48,453
So Laura insisted on having a lunch packed

189
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:50,752
even though her preschool
ends before lunchtime.

190
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,632
So now she's bringing her lunch box home

191
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:54,676
and she's gonna do a
little lunch date with me

192
00:07:54,676 --> 00:07:57,393
and Jeremy if he has a
moment free from work.

193
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,893
- [Jeremy] Is this your lunch?

194
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:04,047
- [Kendra] We're gonna all get to sit down

195
00:08:04,047 --> 00:08:05,464
and eat together.

196
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,760
- [Jeremy] Our little independent miss.

197
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,151
- I put it one and I did it one day.

198
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:13,684
- [Jeremy] And now you can just do it huh?

199
00:08:13,684 --> 00:08:15,147
- She's like a Capri Sun prodigy.

200
00:08:15,147 --> 00:08:16,424
I can barely do that.

201
00:08:16,424 --> 00:08:18,212
Are we having a little date?

202
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:20,418
- I'm so happy to have you as my daughter.

203
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:21,973
You make me so happy.

204
00:08:21,973 --> 00:08:24,473
(piano music)

205
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,568
- Cover up the batter,
hide the wooden spoon.

206
00:08:28,568 --> 00:08:30,147
Did it fall on her?

207
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:32,631
Brush away the sugar, whistling a tune.

208
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:35,347
Nope, it isn't Mama, it's only Mrs. Sheep.

209
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,158
So we're washing Laura's sheets today

210
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,294
and I forgot about that and it's nap time.

211
00:08:39,294 --> 00:08:41,849
So she's just laying on the
mattress pad with a blanket.

212
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,933
Alright, tuckidy tuck in.

213
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,724
- Lay those head down, close that eyes.

214
00:08:47,724 --> 00:08:49,307
- L A U R A, Laura.

215
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:52,465
- That's your name.

216
00:08:54,713 --> 00:08:55,921
Have a good nap big girl.

217
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:56,754
- Okay.

218
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,938
Can we read only one book?

219
00:08:59,938 --> 00:09:01,633
- You want me to read you one?

220
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:05,087
Alright let's do it,
There's a Bear on my Chair.

221
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,364
Do you like that one?

222
00:09:06,364 --> 00:09:08,614
There's a bear on my chair.

223
00:09:13,724 --> 00:09:15,071
Alright I'm here to pick up the kids

224
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:17,045
from their first day of school.

225
00:09:17,045 --> 00:09:19,795
How was your first day of school?

226
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,757
- Good.

227
00:09:22,757 --> 00:09:24,545
- [Jeremy] Alright, let's
go find the other kids.

228
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:25,752
- Isaac guess what?

229
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:27,633
I got a new meter stick.

230
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,328
- [Jeremy] So how was
your first day of school?

231
00:09:29,328 --> 00:09:30,373
- It was good.

232
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:31,975
- [Jeremy] Did you have
any friends in your class?

233
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:35,133
- Yep and I made new ones too.

234
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,300
(giggles)

235
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:41,464
(piano music)

236
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,630
(upbeat music)

237
00:09:55,776 --> 00:00:00,000
- Sorry we're closed.
