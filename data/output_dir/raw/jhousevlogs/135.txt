1
00:00:00,286 --> 00:00:01,519
- Shake it out.

2
00:00:01,519 --> 00:00:04,784
- Ah ah.

3
00:00:04,784 --> 00:00:07,377
(baby laughing)

4
00:00:07,377 --> 00:00:09,244
- There it is.

5
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:10,487
- Let me guess who didn't

6
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:11,565
take a nap today.

7
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:12,492
- This the winner.

8
00:00:12,492 --> 00:00:14,295
- Ah. (girls screaming)

9
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,128
- Yum!

10
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:16,917
- [Child] Three, two, one.

11
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:19,700
(fast upbeat music)

12
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,524
- We're starting the day off

13
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:23,357
with some family yoga.

14
00:00:24,634 --> 00:00:25,911
- [Instructor] Lift one leg

15
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:27,844
and place it as high as you can.

16
00:00:27,844 --> 00:00:30,858
Bring the palms of your
hands together and your foot.

17
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:31,733
- [Kendra] Good job.

18
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:34,609
- [Instructor] Now you're
balancing like a tree.

19
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:37,026
(slow music)

20
00:00:50,597 --> 00:00:51,760
(Caleb yelling)

21
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,871
- Apparently this one's
called the lion pose.

22
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:57,398
- [Jeremy] You gotta roar. (child roaring)

23
00:00:57,398 --> 00:00:59,056
- This one's the snake pose.

24
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:01,682
- [Instructor] One, two, three, strike!

25
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:04,587
(children hissing)

26
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:06,866
- Shake it out, shake it out.

27
00:01:06,866 --> 00:01:08,567
- [Instructor] Everything everywhere,

28
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:09,662
let your body move.

29
00:01:09,662 --> 00:01:11,646
- That's a great yoga pose,

30
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:13,396
you guys are awesome at this.

31
00:01:13,396 --> 00:01:14,460
You're an athlete what

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,363
do you think of yoga?

33
00:01:15,363 --> 00:01:16,314
- It's okay.

34
00:01:16,314 --> 00:01:17,147
- I love yoga.

35
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:18,672
It's amazing how good
it feels on your body

36
00:01:18,672 --> 00:01:20,591
and what a great start to
the day it is with the kids.

37
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:23,606
(children laughing)

38
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:26,385
- Okay, okay, I'm gonna move here.

39
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:28,652
- [Kendra] What'd going on?

40
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:30,195
- We're playing a game.

41
00:01:30,195 --> 00:01:32,837
- [Kendra] And it's come down to

42
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:34,491
- Yeah.

43
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:37,572
- [Kendra] Kings and one pawn.

44
00:01:37,572 --> 00:01:41,182
- We're saying he can move
anywhere now, the pawn.

45
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:42,553
- [Mother] I don't think you can

46
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:43,448
change the rules dude.

47
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,653
- Yeah, you can only move this.

48
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:46,019
- Okay.

49
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,899
- So only one thing sounds really good

50
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,092
for dinner tonight and it's

51
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:50,534
chicken tortilla soup,

52
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:51,755
but luckily I have a good recipe

53
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:52,833
I haven't made for awhile.

54
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:54,345
And I found it, it's slow cooker

55
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,437
chicken tortilla soup.

56
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:56,960
So I just dump everything in the crock pot

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,207
and let it cook, yum.

58
00:01:58,207 --> 00:02:00,790
(upbeat music)

59
00:02:08,904 --> 00:02:10,877
- So this morning around 4:30am

60
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:12,959
Janae woke up, Kendra fed her

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,486
and I laid her down

62
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:16,722
and then I couldn't go back to sleep.

63
00:02:16,722 --> 00:02:18,652
My mind has just been racing

64
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,839
about this thing for work that's coming up

65
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,843
next week and I laid in bed
for over an hour and a half.

66
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,667
Finally I just started to get up

67
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,420
and start working on it.

68
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,508
But I was wondering if
that ever happens to you?

69
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:30,711
Where you can't sleep because

70
00:02:30,711 --> 00:02:32,121
you're excited about something,

71
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,588
or you're working on something

72
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:35,547
that keeps you up at night.

73
00:02:35,547 --> 00:02:37,251
So let me know in the poll,

74
00:02:37,251 --> 00:02:39,145
do you ever struggle with sleeping?

75
00:02:39,145 --> 00:02:40,127
Do you see the spider?

76
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,582
- Uh huh.

77
00:02:41,582 --> 00:02:43,415
- [Jeremy] Shush, wow.

78
00:02:44,804 --> 00:02:45,687
- It moved.

79
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:46,939
- [Jeremy] It moved.

80
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:51,022
That big old spider, crazy.

81
00:02:52,674 --> 00:02:55,546
- It stopped raining so we
had to sneak outside and play.

82
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:58,420
(fast electronic music)

83
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,253
- Oh ho.

84
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,545
There it is.

85
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:24,658
- Ah ho. (baby laughing)

86
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:28,825
Peek a boo. (baby laughing)

87
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:34,330
Peek a boo, peek a boo (baby laughing)

88
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,830
- [Kendra] Did you find Sissy?

89
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:42,521
- Peek a boo.

90
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:46,354
Peek a boo.

91
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:49,354
Ah ha.

92
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,173
- So this is a tradition

93
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:55,365
that goes all the way back to Issac

94
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:56,427
when he was a baby.

95
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,749
When the kids had a poppy diaper,

96
00:03:57,749 --> 00:03:59,625
I didn't like to just
take it out to the trash.

97
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:03,527
I'd like to try to make an
amazing shot into the trash.

98
00:04:03,527 --> 00:04:05,200
So lately Janae's been providing us

99
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,710
with a lot of ammunition.

100
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,007
(bell ringing)

101
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,426
- [Jeremy] Great, first shot!

102
00:04:10,426 --> 00:04:11,817
That was amazing.

103
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:15,177
Okay, cubbie, you want to scoot up a bit?

104
00:04:15,177 --> 00:04:17,062
(bell ringing)

105
00:04:17,062 --> 00:04:17,894
Oh!

106
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,499
He has natural skill.

107
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,915
Oh, here she comes.

108
00:04:20,915 --> 00:04:22,130
Here she comes.

109
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,473
(bell ringing)

110
00:04:24,473 --> 00:04:26,081
Whoo! (girl cheering)

111
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:29,276
Alright let's go wash our hands.

112
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:32,276
(fast upbeat music)

113
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:37,130
- So something we often do in the car

114
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,450
is we do read alouds,

115
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,851
this is our current read aloud,

116
00:04:39,851 --> 00:04:40,823
we just started it today

117
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:41,656
and we're liking it.

118
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:43,635
Any guesses who didn't take a nap today?

119
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,214
- [Jeremy] Well not till now.

120
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,826
- That's rue, she just fell asleep though

121
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:48,092
it was a short drive.

122
00:04:48,092 --> 00:04:50,092
Laura, Laura.

123
00:04:54,345 --> 00:04:55,933
- So we're at Joann's Fabric

124
00:04:55,933 --> 00:04:57,273
for all the kids to pick out

125
00:04:57,273 --> 00:04:58,838
fabric for a blanket they're gonna make.

126
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:00,102
They're each gonna make their own,

127
00:05:00,102 --> 00:05:02,240
then we're gonna donate
them to a local nonprofit.

128
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
(slow upbeat music)

129
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:13,858
- So you've narrowed
it down to these five?

130
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,478
Looks like Apps on our phone,

131
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:16,311
- Ah.

132
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:17,959
- [Jeremy] That's kind of cool.

133
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:22,005
Then you got this soccer,
basketball, football and tools.

134
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:25,448
Which one do you want to take out?

135
00:05:25,448 --> 00:05:27,681
Okay, you've narrowed it
down to the final two?

136
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:29,965
Which one you gonna go with?

137
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:32,195
This is the one?

138
00:05:32,195 --> 00:05:33,694
- This is the one.

139
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:34,881
- [Jeremy] You went with the footballs?

140
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:35,714
- Yep.

141
00:05:35,714 --> 00:05:36,931
- [Kendra] Hey Laura,
do you want to pick out

142
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,162
some fabric for a blanket?

143
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:39,237
- Yeah, I want pink.

144
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:41,618
- [Kendra] Oh, you like pink,
there's lots of pink options.

145
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,889
Okay, let's see if we can find something.

146
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,271
- Oh yeah, I choose that one.

147
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:47,923
- [Kendra] You like the lady bug one?

148
00:05:47,923 --> 00:05:49,178
- [Laura] Uh huh.

149
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:50,673
- [Kendra] Whoa look how pretty

150
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:51,513
that one is.

151
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:53,403
- This is not heavy at all.

152
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:55,773
- [Kendra] Oh that one
has unicorns and castles.

153
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,010
How are you gonna decide?

154
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,952
- I choose the lady bug one.

155
00:05:58,952 --> 00:06:00,809
- I choose black.

156
00:06:00,809 --> 00:06:02,824
- [Kendra] You're gonna choose black?

157
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:04,912
- Uh huh, because my
favorite color is black.

158
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:06,969
- Your new favorite color is black huh.

159
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:09,632
Sometimes as a mom it's
really hard to let go

160
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:11,069
of control and actually let them pick out

161
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:12,479
the things they want to choose,

162
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,859
not the ones I want to choose.

163
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,080
But I love that they're decisive

164
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,289
and they know what they want.

165
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:17,858
So Jeremy we were walking to find you guys

166
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,774
and she shreeks at this aisle.

167
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:20,607
She's like wait stop.

168
00:06:20,607 --> 00:06:22,089
- It's all sparkly.

169
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,380
- I want mermaid.

170
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,151
- [Jeremy] I want mermaid.

171
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,157
- [Kendra] You want to be a mermaid?

172
00:06:27,157 --> 00:06:27,990
- Uh huh.

173
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,600
- Kind of looks princessy over here.

174
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,813
Have you seen this one?

175
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:32,020
- [Kendra] Issac found a section

176
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,002
he could get excited about.

177
00:06:33,002 --> 00:06:33,976
Sports teams.

178
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:35,312
- [Issac] I love this section.

179
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,630
- We found Royals fabric.

180
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,223
- [Issac] I love this.

181
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:39,481
- [Kendra] So I think that's

182
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,314
a really cool color

183
00:06:40,314 --> 00:06:41,813
to put on the back of that one.

184
00:06:41,813 --> 00:06:42,646
Good pick.

185
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:43,937
So do you know what you want?

186
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,034
- I have no idea.

187
00:06:45,034 --> 00:06:46,639
- [Kendra] Uh oh, that sounds familiar.

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,716
You nad I are pretty similar.

189
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:48,549
- Yeah.

190
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:49,382
This one.

191
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:51,205
- [Kendra] You like that one, it's pretty.

192
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:52,038
- Yeah.

193
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:53,162
Ah, I want that one.

194
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,121
- You like it?

195
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,548
- Uh huh.

196
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,176
I think I need to narrow it down

197
00:06:57,176 --> 00:06:59,168
so then I won't come home with a ton.

198
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,874
- [Kendra] So many choices, huh.

199
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:01,707
- I know.

200
00:07:01,707 --> 00:07:03,135
- [Kendra] And they're all cute.

201
00:07:03,135 --> 00:07:04,335
- Uh huh.

202
00:07:04,335 --> 00:07:05,484
Oh it's so hard.

203
00:07:05,484 --> 00:07:07,811
- [Kendra] 'Cause they're
all great choices.

204
00:07:07,811 --> 00:07:09,228
- Alright so we're needing

205
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:10,819
a yard of everything.

206
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:11,668
There we go.

207
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:15,354
So she's measuring it
out to be exactly a yard.

208
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:18,354
(fast guitar music)

209
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,555
- [Woman] It'll be 36.25.

210
00:07:27,555 --> 00:07:30,135
- So the fabric store is really close

211
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:31,311
to one of our favorite parks,

212
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:32,233
so we had to stop.

213
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:33,359
Who wants to play?

214
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:34,778
- [Jeremy] American Ninja warrior!

215
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:37,778
(fast guitar music)

216
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,562
- Go! (girls screaming)

217
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:56,868
- I climbed up all by myself.

218
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:59,285
- [Kendra] Good job big girl.

219
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:02,744
- Did it.

220
00:08:02,744 --> 00:08:03,821
- [Kendra] Good job.

221
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:04,654
- Ah ha.

222
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:06,648
- I'm so grateful that dinner is cooking

223
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:08,573
in the crock pot because we can stay out

224
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,469
and play all the way
until dinner time and then

225
00:08:10,469 --> 00:08:11,610
go home and dinner's ready.

226
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,179
I love that feeling.

227
00:08:13,179 --> 00:08:17,134
(slow music)

228
00:08:17,134 --> 00:08:21,301
- Wo, wo!

229
00:08:24,457 --> 00:08:26,992
- [Kendra] You've gotten so
much better at cartwheels,

230
00:08:26,992 --> 00:08:28,595
you're doing awesome.

231
00:08:28,595 --> 00:08:31,178
(upbeat music)

232
00:08:40,606 --> 00:08:42,477
- Together so that none of it falls out.

233
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:45,317
- [Jeremy] What are you making Elise?

234
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:46,290
- Cornbread.

235
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,424
- [Jeremy] For dinner?

236
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:48,257
- Ah huh.

237
00:08:48,257 --> 00:08:50,718
- [Jeremy] It's gonna be good.

238
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,718
- I got it perfectly.

239
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:56,145
I know.

240
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:58,236
- [Laura] I'm just helping it.

241
00:08:58,236 --> 00:08:59,069
- Not yet.

242
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:10,456
- Yum!

243
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:18,459
- It's looking perfect.

244
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,874
And it even says 400.

245
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:24,337
- [Jeremy] Yep and you
only have 15 seconds left.

246
00:09:24,337 --> 00:09:25,925
Should we get it our and test it?

247
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:29,424
- Seven, six, five, four,

248
00:09:29,424 --> 00:09:31,207
three, two, one.

249
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:32,448
Your foods ready!

250
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:35,786
- [Jeremy] Alright,
let's open it up and see.

251
00:09:35,786 --> 00:09:37,000
Looks good.

252
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,149
- [Kendra] Here's our
chicken tortilla soup

253
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:41,154
that cooked in the crock pot all day.

254
00:09:41,154 --> 00:09:42,362
How's the cornbread?

255
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,195
- Good!

256
00:09:43,195 --> 00:09:44,175
- [Kendra] Nice work.

257
00:09:44,175 --> 00:09:46,231
- So after dinner, Elise
is heading to Ballet,

258
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,564
Issac he has scouts and then
we're gonna head to bed.

259
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:49,446
J house out.

260
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:52,196
(kids screaming)

261
00:09:57,326 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Unison] Hee haw, hee haw, hee haw.
