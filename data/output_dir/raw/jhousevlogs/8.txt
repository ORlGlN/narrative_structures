1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,044
- Bye.

2
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:01,940
- Bye.

3
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,773
- [Kendra] What are you guys doin'?

4
00:00:02,773 --> 00:00:03,791
- Vloggin'.

5
00:00:03,791 --> 00:00:07,780
(tropical beat music)

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,890
- I decided when I'm older,

7
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:10,150
I'm never gonna grow up.

8
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,244
- [Jeremy] Laura, you're doing awesome.

9
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:13,130
- Thanks.

10
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,260
- Isaac's doing the coolest thing,

11
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,210
you gotta see this.

12
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:22,490
Well it's kinda rainy
and dreary out today.

13
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:24,410
Jeremy is at work

14
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,977
and the kids and I are starting
the day off with a prayer.

15
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:29,627
Dear Heavenly Father--

16
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:30,460
(tender music)

17
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,229
We're having a good
breakfast this morning,

18
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,200
eggs, toast, yogurt, granola

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,260
and talking about things
that we're grateful for

20
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,870
and really really trying
to get the day off

21
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:38,703
to a good start.

22
00:00:38,703 --> 00:00:39,560
Hopefully it helps.

23
00:00:43,982 --> 00:00:46,565
("Ode to Joy")

24
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:56,586
(jazzy piano playing)

25
00:01:04,837 --> 00:01:07,420
(lively music)

26
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:12,731
- Hi.
- Hi.

27
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,310
(laughing)

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,840
- She just had a baby.

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,410
- And her name is Lily.

30
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,690
- Bye.
- Bye.

31
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,145
- [Kendra] What are you guys doing?

32
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,121
- Vloggin'.

33
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,963
Now I need to edit the video.

34
00:01:21,963 --> 00:01:24,480
- Can you send the video to me?

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,830
That's really funny.

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,690
- [Kendra] How's your baby?

37
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,962
- She's doing good.

38
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,533
(kiss)

39
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,210
- [Kendra] We have this old phone

40
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:34,860
and Janae is playing with it.

41
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,442
She's been saying hello, it's adorable.

42
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:38,469
- Hello.

43
00:01:38,469 --> 00:01:39,712
- [Kendra] Hello.

44
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:40,580
- Hello.

45
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,320
- So with the kids pretending
to vlog this morning

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,420
and Janae walking around saying hello,

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,120
it just makes me so aware,

48
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,680
almost painfully aware of the fact

49
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,440
that my kids are watching me all the time

50
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,760
and they're learning from what I do,

51
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,220
and for good and for bad,

52
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,420
so I need to watch what I'm doing

53
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,060
and make sure I'm setting
a really good example

54
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,960
for them to follow.

55
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,515
Bye, where are you guys going?

56
00:01:59,515 --> 00:02:00,715
- To his wedding.

57
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:02,070
- [Kendra] You guys are
going to Caleb's wedding?

58
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,935
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

59
00:02:02,935 --> 00:02:04,129
(shaker rattling)

60
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:05,800
- Somebody found shakers

61
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,610
and is so proud of herself.

62
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,130
I love watching her play.

63
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,470
It's just interesting to see

64
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,930
how she's exploring and discovering stuff.

65
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,670
It's truly entertaining to me.

66
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,700
Isaac's doing the coolest
thing, you gotta see this.

67
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,500
- I figured out how far the
free throw line would be

68
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,050
compared to an NBA place.

69
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,570
This hoop is five feet 10 inches tall.

70
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,770
The real NBA hoop is 10 feet tall

71
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,567
so I found what's 60 percent

72
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,088
and I looked in a book to see

73
00:02:32,088 --> 00:02:33,620
what the free throw line,

74
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,460
how far it is from the
hoop and it's 19 feet.

75
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,410
- So Isaac measured the hoop in his room

76
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,270
and compared it to a real NBA hoop

77
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,490
and then he took the distance
that it would normally be

78
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,590
to a free throw line and
used that same percentage

79
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,200
to calculate how far out his
free throw line should be.

80
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,390
So Janae and I are spending
some quality time on the stairs.

81
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,910
I'm trying to teach her
how to go down correctly.

82
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,854
She's so close to getting it.

83
00:02:54,854 --> 00:02:55,687
(Janae babbling)

84
00:02:55,687 --> 00:02:57,023
Yeah, are you learning?

85
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,410
So as soon as Janae learns
to safely go down the stairs,

86
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,950
we can move the baby gate.

87
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,050
She goes up just great,

88
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,290
but we gotta teach her
how to go down safely,

89
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,840
which just takes practice huh?

90
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,850
Elise had a great idea,

91
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,210
the big kids are gonna
show Janae how to do it.

92
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:14,498
Sit down, turn around and go down.

93
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,081
(bluesy music)

94
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:19,889
Stop, sit.

95
00:03:19,889 --> 00:03:21,427
(Janae yells)

96
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:24,150
Good job, yay, she says cheer.

97
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,770
Going down.

98
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,110
- [Isaac] She sees us
just walk down the stairs.

99
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,593
- I know, so it's hard for her.

100
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:30,593
- Yay!
- Yay!

101
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:33,346
- Sit down.

102
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,465
(kids clapping)

103
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,682
- Yay!
- Yay!

104
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:39,147
- Turn around and then you go down.

105
00:03:39,147 --> 00:03:39,980
Yay!
- Yay!

106
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:45,334
(bright guitar music)

107
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,603
- [Jeremy] So for snack we're
doing nuts and dried fruit.

108
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,190
The kids were all complaining

109
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,820
that they wanted a snack.

110
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,400
Nae Nae's like what about me?

111
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,810
- I decided when I'm older,

112
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,643
I'm never gonna grow up.

113
00:03:57,643 --> 00:03:59,440
- [Jeremy] You don't wanna grow up?

114
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,440
- Yep, I'm gonna stay a kid.

115
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,273
- [Jeremy] Why?

116
00:04:02,273 --> 00:04:04,791
- 'Cause I just like my childhood.

117
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,624
- [Jeremy] Good.

118
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:06,457
How bout you Isaac?

119
00:04:06,457 --> 00:04:07,560
Do you ever want to grow up?

120
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,490
- Yeah.

121
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,323
- [Child] Why?

122
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:12,545
- I wanna sometime be in the NFL or NBA.

123
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:13,530
- [Jeremy] So to play sports?

124
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,910
- Mmm-hmm, and also to have
kids, I wanna have kids.

125
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,208
- I wanna grow up

126
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:21,690
and I want to try to be
on the same team as Isaac.

127
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,680
- [Jeremy] For sports.

128
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,790
Nae Nae, do you want to grow up

129
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,173
or be a kid forever?

130
00:04:26,254 --> 00:04:27,540
- A kid.

131
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,795
- [Jeremy] A kid.

132
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:29,628
(Jeremy laughs)

133
00:04:29,628 --> 00:04:30,990
- [Caleb] No, she's saying frog.

134
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,298
- [Jeremy] She said I want to be a frog.

135
00:04:34,298 --> 00:04:35,600
(laughing)

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,030
A dog, you think about dogs?

137
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,980
I want to be a dog.

138
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,600
This is a tough choice,

139
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,200
what should I be when I grow up?

140
00:04:45,545 --> 00:04:46,880
(tropical beat music)

141
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
You jumpin'?

142
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,597
I love how she has one little finger up.

143
00:04:50,597 --> 00:04:51,680
(Janae squeals)

144
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,513
Hey.

145
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:55,605
- Ha!

146
00:04:56,711 --> 00:04:57,544
(Jeremy laughs)

147
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:58,790
- [Jeremy] That's a wall.

148
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:02,380
(Janae squeals)

149
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,250
Face plant.

150
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,140
These boys have been playing basketball

151
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,734
for at least a couple hours today.

152
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,110
- Four hours.

153
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,210
- [Jeremy] Four hours?

154
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,013
Nice.

155
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:14,846
Walk.

156
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,533
(playful music)

157
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,877
(Kendra laughs)

158
00:05:17,877 --> 00:05:19,300
Are you walking the dog?

159
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,460
- So when we first got it,

160
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,000
she would walk towards the dog

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,050
and didn't understand she had to pull it.

162
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,819
- [Elise] It's gonna walk toward me if I--

163
00:05:32,296 --> 00:05:33,306
- [Jeremy] Nice.

164
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,150
So Elise is trying to advance

165
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:36,040
to the next level in gymnastics.

166
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,873
- Yep.

167
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:37,706
- [Jeremy] This is one of the things

168
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:38,539
she was told to work on.

169
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,820
- Hand stand, flat back,

170
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,818
it's like a tree falling down.
- Hand stand, flat backs.

171
00:05:41,818 --> 00:05:44,218
- [Jeremy] Okay.

172
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,051
(whack)

173
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:47,750
- Our family is kind of
switching up our morning routine

174
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,510
and getting some new
chore systems into place.

175
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,240
We're needing the kids to be involved more

176
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,440
and this is an object lesson

177
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,970
that's gonna hopefully
gonna explain to them more.

178
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:59,850
Alright guys, so this cup is me

179
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:04,120
and that water is all of my
energy and strength, okay?

180
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,640
And these cups are everything
that I need to do in a day.

181
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,610
Shall we see how far my energy lasts?

182
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,030
So let's say I need to start the day

183
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,623
with changing Janae's diaper.

184
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,250
That's not too hard.

185
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,760
Now I'm going to make some breakfast.

186
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,030
- [Caleb] A little harder.

187
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,333
- Now I need to teach
the kids some school.

188
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:32,200
Uh-oh, there was some whining,

189
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,720
that takes more energy from Mom,

190
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,570
whenever there's whining,
it takes more energy.

191
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,110
I need to plan the rest of the meals

192
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,943
for our family.

193
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,080
How about go grocery shopping,

194
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,180
is that something Mom does?

195
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,220
- Yeah.
_ That's real easy.

196
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,650
- [Kendra] Then I put
Janae down for a nap,

197
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,133
maybe feed Janae.

198
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,960
Uh-oh, how's my water doing guys?

199
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,793
- Not very well.

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,220
- [Kendra] Do I have very much left over?

201
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,143
Now it's time for some laundry.

202
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,868
How about cleaning up the kitchen?

203
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:07,285
- [Caleb] That might take away all of it.

204
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:09,811
- [Kendra] Well do you
know what just happened?

205
00:07:09,811 --> 00:07:10,644
- What?
- What?

206
00:07:10,644 --> 00:07:11,540
- [Kendra] Now some kids are arguing,

207
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,483
that takes extra energy.

208
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,750
Oh man, they're still arguing,

209
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,150
that takes more energy.

210
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,930
Now Mom's gonna clean the house,

211
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:22,313
clean up all the clutter, maybe the shoes.

212
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,460
- You're almost out.

213
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,370
- [Kendra] I know.

214
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:28,640
I gotta respond to some
emails, do some work.

215
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,330
Oh no, what happened?

216
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,380
- Your energy ran out.
- Your energy ran out.

217
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,050
- [Kendra] My energy ran out.

218
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,450
- So maybe we could do a few of that stuff

219
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:39,841
to take it away, so you still have a lot.

220
00:07:39,841 --> 00:07:40,830
- [Kendra] You think so?

221
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,203
So see this water?

222
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:43,036
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

223
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:46,310
- [Kendra] This is things
that fill Mommy up, okay?

224
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,210
When Mommy gets to sleep
at night, that helps.

225
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,930
When Mommy gets to exercise, that helps.

226
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,500
When Mommy's able to pray

227
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,063
and read her scriptures, that helps.

228
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,150
When Mommy has cheerful attitudes

229
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,973
from her kiddos, that helps.

230
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:08,260
- When they help with Nae Nae.

231
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,920
- [Kendra] Yep, when you
guys help me out, that helps.

232
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,220
And then look what I have.

233
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,630
Now I have more water.

234
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,960
So now when you guys say hey Mom,

235
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,780
can we go to the park, well sure,

236
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,950
I've still got some water,

237
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,310
we can go to the park.

238
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,250
Mom, can we invite a friend over?

239
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,190
Yeah sure, I've got some extra water,

240
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,550
we can invite some friends over.

241
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,110
Hey Mom, can we make cookies?

242
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,520
Sure, no problem.

243
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,390
- Oh yeah, let's, we can make cookies!

244
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:33,380
- So now there's water left over.

245
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,220
So this analogy was about Mom,

246
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,350
but every single person
only has so much strength.

247
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,730
They can only do so much.

248
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:41,809
What did you learn from that?

249
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,370
- I learned that the more we obey

250
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,740
and the less time we take from Mom,

251
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,620
the more fun stuff we get to do.

252
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,453
- [Kendra] As a family?

253
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:51,750
- And because Mom has way more energy.

254
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,270
- If you're losing your energy,

255
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:57,790
we should hop on and you'll
get your energy back.

256
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,270
- When we obey,

257
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:01,880
there's more energy.

258
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,340
When we help you,

259
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,280
we can do more fun stuff.

260
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,180
- But if we disobey and we're whining,

261
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,320
then all your energy goes out

262
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,895
and we just kind of
have a bad time of day.

263
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,546
♪ Hallelujah ♪

264
00:09:16,546 --> 00:09:19,713
(lively guitar music)

265
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,500
- [Kendra] So Laura's
been talking to me today

266
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,140
about when she grows up.

267
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,127
What are you gonna do
when you grow up Laura?

268
00:09:34,127 --> 00:09:36,443
- You, you and you are gonna

269
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,523
be my parents when I grow up.

270
00:09:41,523 --> 00:09:43,745
- [Kendra] Oh when you grow up
we're gonna be your parents?

271
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:44,578
- Mmm-hmm.

272
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,570
- Me and my honey will be?

273
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,790
I want to remember when Laura grows up,

274
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,490
that at this stage, she calls
your spouse, your honey.

275
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,350
Mom, where's your honey, she'll say,

276
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,440
or Mom, when I grow up,
I 'm gonna have a honey

277
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,760
just like you do.

278
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,340
It's just really sweet to me.

279
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,827
She's even asked other
people that we know,

280
00:10:01,827 --> 00:10:02,950
where's your honey?

281
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:05,640
Baked potatoes with cottage cheese,

282
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,593
beans and vegetables.

283
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:10,268
- Go.

284
00:10:10,268 --> 00:10:12,935
(uptempo music)

285
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,428
Stop stop.

286
00:10:15,428 --> 00:10:17,243
And then you got right here at the end.

287
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,552
All you got, run run run run run run run.

288
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,000
- Ready, go.

289
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,250
(uptempo bluesy music)

290
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,930
- So flag football is about to start

291
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,010
and we're doing evaluations tonight.

292
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,453
So how'd you feel it went?

293
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,814
- I thought it went very well.

294
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:46,000
- [Jeremy] It looked
like you were having fun.

295
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,833
- [Coach] Good job, great job.

296
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:48,240
- [Man On Tablet] And then
we're gonna draw another line

297
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,770
up here on the top that connects.

298
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,670
Simple shape, good job,

299
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,074
okay now let's connect
the wing to the car.

300
00:10:57,074 --> 00:11:02,074
- I added a few things.

301
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,713
- [Jeremy] Laura, you're doing awesome.

302
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,690
- [Man On Tablet] Right
here, that's a big one,

303
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,793
that's his helmet.

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,343
- [Jeremy] You almost ready for bed?

305
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,369
- Yeah.

306
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,293
- [Jeremy] What are you reading?

307
00:11:18,293 --> 00:11:20,082
- Cam Jansen.

308
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:20,915
- [Jeremy] You likin' it?

309
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:21,748
- Yeah.

310
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:23,558
Goodnight J house out.

311
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,382
- [Jeremy] What are alpacas?

312
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:27,043
- I don't know, we haven't seen 'em.

313
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:29,787
- [Jeremy] This is an alpaca right here.

314
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:33,120
(jangly old-time music)

315
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,150
(Janae yells)

316
00:11:36,150 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] You think
you'd like alpaca clothes?
