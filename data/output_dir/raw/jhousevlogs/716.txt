1
00:00:00,152 --> 00:00:03,084
- Hey guys, we are watching
the lunar eclipse right now.

2
00:00:03,084 --> 00:00:05,375
We're all snuggled out here.

3
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:08,792
And we've been having a really good time.

4
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,669
- Pee pee.

5
00:00:10,669 --> 00:00:12,156
Pee pees.

6
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:14,475
- [Jeremy] Pee pees?

7
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:15,516
- Di pee pee.

8
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,759
- [Jeremy] Let's change the diaper.

9
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,259
- Diaper.
- Diaper.

10
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:23,108
(delicate music)

11
00:00:37,468 --> 00:00:40,885
You're so gentle and soft with that baby.

12
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,825
- I help.

13
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,889
- [Jeremy] Do you need some help?

14
00:00:56,889 --> 00:00:57,722
All right.

15
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:04,559
- Thank you.

16
00:01:08,873 --> 00:01:10,024
- Good morning and happy Monday.

17
00:01:10,024 --> 00:01:12,373
We are out at the garden
class this morning,

18
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,332
and it just feels good.

19
00:01:13,332 --> 00:01:15,117
The weather's nice. The sun is shining.

20
00:01:15,117 --> 00:01:18,071
We're out in the garden. It's
a good way to start a week.

21
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:18,904
- Look!

22
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:21,709
- [Kendra] Did you get it?

23
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:23,252
Way to go. What is that, dude?

24
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:24,869
- A beet.
- A beet?

25
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:25,702
- Cool.

26
00:01:29,069 --> 00:01:31,879
- [Kendra] Poke him out of the ground.

27
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,629
You got it, good job.

28
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,314
A pepper!

29
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:39,035
Hunting for strawberries.

30
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:40,434
- [Isaac] There's only baby ones.

31
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:42,971
- [Kendra] There's only baby
ones? Are they not ripe yet?

32
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:44,138
Nope, not yet.

33
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:47,177
- You can draw a picture.

34
00:01:49,949 --> 00:01:50,782
- [Kendra] All right, Caleb,

35
00:01:50,782 --> 00:01:52,438
what do you think of beet pancakes?

36
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:53,271
- Good.

37
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:54,417
- [Kendra] They're good? You like 'em?

38
00:01:54,417 --> 00:01:55,250
- Yeah.

39
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,962
- Now we are having lunch.

40
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:57,795
- Cheese great.

41
00:01:57,795 --> 00:01:59,269
- [Kendra] And we're having
a new kind of a lunch.

42
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,469
So I just took these fun plates

43
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:04,208
and I cut up some cheese.

44
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:06,118
And this is cheese tortellini.
It's actually cold.

45
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:07,776
It's from last night, but
I think it works well.

46
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:09,279
It's like a cold pasta salad.

47
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,841
And here's some ham.

48
00:02:10,841 --> 00:02:11,922
And then we've got green peppers

49
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,696
from garden class this morning, cucumbers,

50
00:02:13,696 --> 00:02:17,279
a grape tomato and some
olives, some apple.

51
00:02:21,063 --> 00:02:24,179
But I'm just loving
watching Caleb at work.

52
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,851
(Laura yells)

53
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:27,348
What?

54
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:29,294
So she looks like I just haven't fed her.

55
00:02:29,294 --> 00:02:31,686
Where's your food, Laura?

56
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,103
Yeah, down there.

57
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:37,149
Say, I got fed, I just
threw it all on the ground.

58
00:02:37,149 --> 00:02:39,078
Like a crazy person.

59
00:02:39,078 --> 00:02:41,029
- Crazy person.

60
00:02:41,029 --> 00:02:43,308
- [Kendra] Did you just say crazy person?

61
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:45,581
Can you say crazy person?

62
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:46,998
Oh, is she tired?

63
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,900
♫ Daddy daddy da

64
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,074
- How can you not be excited to come home

65
00:02:59,074 --> 00:03:00,174
to that little song?

66
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:03,396
♫ Daddy daddy da

67
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:05,293
- She was just screaming
when I walked up the stairs,

68
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:07,143
daddy, daddy!

69
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:08,117
- [Laura] Daddy, daddy.

70
00:03:08,117 --> 00:03:09,442
- When we were in the park--

71
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:10,727
Daddy, daddy?

72
00:03:10,727 --> 00:03:13,668
When we were at the park, a
white car drove by the park

73
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:15,034
and she was swinging and she looked over

74
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:17,886
and she squealed, daddy, daddy, daddy!

75
00:03:17,886 --> 00:03:20,275
You thought it was daddy, huh?

76
00:03:20,275 --> 00:03:23,094
(speaks indistinctly)

77
00:03:23,094 --> 00:03:25,436
- Yeah, that happens sometimes.

78
00:03:25,436 --> 00:03:27,291
We're finishing off
lunch with some popcorn,

79
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:31,458
which the kids have discovered
they can blow around.

80
00:03:32,405 --> 00:03:35,905
- What? Elise has a secret weapon, eating.

81
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,269
- [Kendra] Elise has a
secret weapon, eating.

82
00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:42,352
- [Elise] Mm!

83
00:03:44,877 --> 00:03:46,767
- Can you blow it?

84
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:47,767
There we go.

85
00:03:54,557 --> 00:03:57,489
At first I was like, you
guys, don't blow your food.

86
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:59,150
And then Kendra was like,
well doesn't that look fun?

87
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,840
And I was like, yeah.

88
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,340
So, Kendra's got in blowing with the kids.

89
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:09,505
- Try to only parent when
absolutely necessary.

90
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,473
Hey, oh, no popcorn fight.

91
00:04:12,473 --> 00:04:14,094
- [Jeremy] But doesn't that look fun?

92
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:17,261
- We have to go, in like five minutes.

93
00:04:18,844 --> 00:04:20,827
He got you guys.

94
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:23,989
Now there's a little
smudge on your screen.

95
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:26,683
- Sorry. We gotta clean you off.

96
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,673
(blows raspberry)

97
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:29,877
- All right, well Jeremy,

98
00:04:29,877 --> 00:04:30,745
I don't know if I mentioned it before,

99
00:04:30,745 --> 00:04:32,904
but he has a super flexible work schedule,

100
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:34,809
so he works a ton of hours each week,

101
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,484
but he can move those
hours around as needed,

102
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,572
and so what was really nice is,

103
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:41,977
Laura and Caleb were both exhausted,

104
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:45,186
and so he came and worked
from home this afternoon,

105
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:49,353
so that I could run Elise to
ballet and Isaac to piano.

106
00:04:50,434 --> 00:04:51,908
- [Elise] So the kids are having

107
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:54,325
a hard time waking up, right?

108
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,777
- Yeah. They're both
needing lots of cuddles.

109
00:04:57,777 --> 00:05:00,792
I think maybe their naps
weren't quite long enough.

110
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,547
- [Elise] Yeah, they look tired.

111
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:04,788
- They still do look tired, huh?

112
00:05:04,788 --> 00:05:08,625
- [Elise] Tired little
girl. Tired little girl.

113
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:09,958
- Are you tired?

114
00:05:11,109 --> 00:05:11,942
No?

115
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,799
- [Elise] Are you tired?

116
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:17,151
- He says, no.

117
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:22,089
All right. Woah, that
looks kinda close to me.

118
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,615
- Can I do it?
- You can say hi.

119
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,377
- Hi. I'm vlogging.

120
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:29,497
- [Kendra] You are vlogging.

121
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:31,179
What else are you doing right now?

122
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:33,582
- Um, I'm cooking dinner all by myself.

123
00:05:33,582 --> 00:05:35,782
- [Kendra] Woo, what are we
having for dinner tonight?

124
00:05:35,782 --> 00:05:36,615
- Um,

125
00:05:38,136 --> 00:05:40,303
rice and red chicken and--

126
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,340
- [Kendra] Red chicken?

127
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,624
- No, orange chicken.
- Mm-hm.

128
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:49,541
- It's one of a Chinese
food, and, um, veggies.

129
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,331
- [Kendra] And veggies?

130
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:55,914
(upbeat music)

131
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:16,638
- [Jeremy] Blow it if it's hot.

132
00:06:18,566 --> 00:06:20,421
We weren't fast enough.

133
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,838
You win. We lose.

134
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,541
- I was reaching. I was like, ooh!

135
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,374
And it went over.

136
00:06:26,374 --> 00:06:29,151
- [Jeremy] I was distracted
by something over here.

137
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,438
Can't take my eye off you.

138
00:06:31,438 --> 00:06:32,605
- Oops.
- Oops.

139
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,250
- The kids beat the parents. Yay!

140
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:39,836
Go Laura. Go Laura.

141
00:06:41,364 --> 00:06:43,005
- If we're keeping track,

142
00:06:43,005 --> 00:06:44,039
if we're keeping track of whether or not

143
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:45,639
the kids are winning or us,

144
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,974
we're down, like, 3,000 points?

145
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:49,339
Like, you guys are destroying us.

146
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:50,454
- We're down, like, seven years.

147
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:52,674
- [Jeremy] Okay, there we go.

148
00:06:52,674 --> 00:06:55,007
(baby talk)

149
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,277
- Jeremy's spoiling me again today,

150
00:06:59,277 --> 00:07:01,632
and I got to come alone to
Isaac's football practice.

151
00:07:01,632 --> 00:07:02,465
At least, at the moment.

152
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:03,734
He might pack up the kids and join me,

153
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:06,641
but they weren't done
eating dinner yet, so.

154
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:07,880
Now I'm just watching my boy play.

155
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,617
I love how much Isaac loves
coming out to football.

156
00:07:10,617 --> 00:07:13,867
He just, he thrives. He just adores it.

157
00:07:14,823 --> 00:07:16,573
- [Jeremy] These two.

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,558
Laura keeps running up to
Caleb and giving him a big hug.

159
00:07:21,558 --> 00:07:22,975
You guys hugging?

160
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:25,671
- Yes.

161
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,088
- [Jeremy] Okay, Cub, oh! Oh.

162
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:33,187
She is a tough cookie,
being buds with this guy.

163
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:37,020
Okay, you guys come on.
Let's read scriptures.

164
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:42,076
- [All] J House out.

165
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:43,159
- Good night.

166
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,695
Caleb just wished on a shooting star.

167
00:07:46,695 --> 00:07:48,715
What'd you wish for, buddy?

168
00:07:48,715 --> 00:07:51,548
- [Caleb] I wish I was a real dog.

169
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:55,790
- [Elise] That's just like weird.

170
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:58,575
- [Child] I wish I was a butt.

171
00:07:58,575 --> 00:08:02,167
- [Kendra] Hey, that's
rude. Come here, you.

172
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,118
Cubbie, come here.

173
00:08:03,118 --> 00:08:03,951
- Hey dad?
- Yeah.

174
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,824
- [Child] Is that the Big Dipper?

175
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:07,888
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it's just
above that house over there.

176
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,337
- [Child] What? Where's house?

177
00:08:09,337 --> 00:08:13,729
- [Jeremy] Yup. And then it
points to the North Star.

178
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:17,146
(kids talk indistinctly)

179
