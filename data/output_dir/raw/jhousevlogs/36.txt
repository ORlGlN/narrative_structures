1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,242
- My baby just took her first steps.

2
00:00:03,242 --> 00:00:05,742
(happy music)

3
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,410
Come on do it, come see Mama!

4
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:15,243
- You guys!

5
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:17,956
(excited squealing)

6
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:23,770
- It is early, it is like 6:30 right now.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:26,000
And we are getting ready
to go back to Kansas City,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,490
and so I'm trying to start waking

9
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,060
the kids up a little bit earlier

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,720
each day, so that hopefully
the time change difference

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,660
isn't as big of a deal when
they get home, because it's time

12
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,760
to get ready to go home,
we're going to spend the day

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,670
packing and cleaning and
kind of getting things

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,970
in order for us when we
arrive back in Kansas city.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,780
- So this morning I'm
going to yoga at the beach.

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,190
I'm really excited about it,
it's a little crowded though,

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,948
so hopefully I get a spot.

18
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,448
(happy music)

19
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:12,620
- So while Kendra is doing yoga,

20
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,775
we are playing at a nearby park.

21
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,275
(happy music)

22
00:01:33,592 --> 00:01:35,890
- Dad, this can be our house.

23
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,310
We're making a house,
an underground house.

24
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,540
I get the villain is trying
to, guess we'll just jump it.

25
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,373
- [Jeremy] Wow.

26
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,886
The fort's getting bigger.

27
00:01:50,886 --> 00:01:52,070
- I know.

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,850
See how good that is?

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,765
- [Jeremy] Looks great.

30
00:01:55,765 --> 00:01:58,348
(reggae music)

31
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,470
Looks great buddy.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,940
All right?

33
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,810
- It was amazing to do
yoga, feeling the sun

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,240
and the breeze, and hearing
the ocean and the seagulls,

35
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,090
it was, beautiful, and
I wish I could bottle up

36
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,070
all these feelings and save
them for when I get back

37
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,810
to Kansas City, because I
know it's gonna be cold,

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,919
and I'm gonna be wanting
to experience this again.

39
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,336
(rock music)

40
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,020
- [Jeremy] You helping me clean up?

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,853
- Yeah.

42
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,640
Tearing this down so
then we can take it home.

43
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,100
- So we actually still have
a couple days until we leave

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,150
for Missouri, but we wanted
to start getting everything

45
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,550
ready so it wasn't super stressful

46
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,803
on our last day or two here.

47
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:49,303
(happy music)

48
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,762
(Laura laughing)

49
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:57,311
- [Kendra] Does it have instructions?

50
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,270
All right, we found some
folding instructions.

51
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,650
(nylon folding)

52
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,070
- And the coils come together.

53
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,511
(Laura laughing)

54
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:20,900
- [Kendra] Bow in frame to form a coil.

55
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,620
Your right hand under your left hand.

56
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,103
And this will form --

57
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:30,510
(Jeremy laughing)

58
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,100
- [Jeremy] But you got an extra one.

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,880
That's the one I always
have still hanging out.

60
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,100
Like I can get it except
for that last little one.

61
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,700
You don't wanna break it!

62
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,533
Op!

63
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,510
See daisies.

64
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,280
- Right hand under your left hand?

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,810
- [Jeremy] We tried that.

66
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,470
You still have some hanging out.

67
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:50,660
- Oh!

68
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,493
- [Jeremy] What?

69
00:03:51,493 --> 00:03:52,556
- I did it!

70
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:53,400
- [Jeremy] How?

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,430
- I honestly don't know.

72
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,660
We're just gonna --

73
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,493
- [Jeremy] You meant too.

74
00:03:56,493 --> 00:03:57,413
- Pretend that was on purpose.

75
00:03:57,413 --> 00:03:58,246
- [Jeremy] Good job.

76
00:03:58,246 --> 00:03:59,720
- Okay, open it up.

77
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,500
Easy peasy squeezy.

78
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,480
- So all Jenae wants to
do this morning is walk.

79
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,870
She wants us to hold her
hands, and walk her around,

80
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:10,810
all the kids are taking turns,
and she is going to town.

81
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:13,360
- She'll be whining, and then once

82
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,310
we do this, she's like, ah!

83
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,600
- Let's see what happens.

84
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,469
- Come on do it, come see Mama.

85
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,303
- You guys.

86
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:26,057
(excited squealing)

87
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,303
- [Kendra] She did it!

88
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,220
She did it!

89
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,440
Oh my goodness!

90
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,417
Come see me!

91
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:35,417
Come see me!

92
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:40,458
(excited squealing)

93
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:46,464
(excited squealing)

94
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:49,663
- [Jeremy] She walks!

95
00:04:49,663 --> 00:04:50,630
- [Kendra] She's a walker!

96
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,890
- [Jeremy] That's our girl!

97
00:04:57,013 --> 00:05:00,013
(excited squealing)

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,630
- My baby just took her
first steps, and I'm feeling

99
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,080
all emotional about it,
because I don't think I'm ready

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,090
for her to be so grown up, and
big, I feel like I'm trying

101
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,660
so hard to cherish all these
little milestones with her.

102
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,860
And they're so precious,
so it's fun to enjoy them

103
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,660
as a family, and I'm so proud
of her, like she's so happy

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,890
about it, she's been
wanting and wanting to walk.

105
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:31,910
So I'm excited to see her
progress, but I know that soon

106
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,850
she's gonna be running, and
keeping up with the big kids,

107
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,600
and I'm just like, where's my little baby?

108
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
She's growing up.

109
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,710
I feel like that sounds
so cliched, but having had

110
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,190
several kids, and seeing
how quickly they grow up,

111
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,420
I feel like I get more
sentimental each time.

112
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,250
Like, it's just going by so quickly.

113
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,300
They're, pretty soon gonna
all be grown up and out

114
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,210
of the house, and I'm gonna be all alone.

115
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,280
With Jeremy.

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,210
Okay Jeremy's pretty cool.

117
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,090
I'll take him.

118
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,042
- [Jeremy] I love you.

119
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,635
So he just finished Percy Jackson.

120
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:11,680
What'd'you think?

121
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,880
- I loved it.

122
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,940
- [Jeremy] How would
you compare it to some

123
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,100
of the other books that you've read?

124
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,870
- Well, I think it starts
kind of like Wonder,

125
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,870
and then it ends like Star
Wars-ish, mixed with Greek Gods.

126
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,170
- [Jeremy] So kind of fantasy?

127
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,003
- Uh huh.

128
00:06:27,003 --> 00:06:27,890
- [Jeremy] Would you recommend it?

129
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,390
- Yes, I'd recommend it, for people

130
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,030
that are like my age or older.

131
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:36,460
- [Jeremy] Do you want
to read the next one?

132
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,620
- I'm going to, and totally beyond it.

133
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,700
- Kendra checked it out from the library,

134
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,533
but first we had to pay

135
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,500
our library fines, of over 35 dollars.

136
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,000
Apparently we didn't get all of the books

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,932
back to the library before
we left to San Diego.

138
00:06:48,932 --> 00:06:51,432
(happy music)

139
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,111
- [Jeremy] What flavor did you pick?

140
00:06:58,111 --> 00:06:59,653
- Pineapple.

141
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:00,486
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

142
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,698
What flavor did you do?

143
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:03,139
- Brown sugar.

144
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:04,658
- [Jeremy] Brown sugar.

145
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:06,244
- There we go!

146
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:07,364
- [Jeremy] Yummy!

147
00:07:07,364 --> 00:07:09,730
- Laura's is lychee cream.

148
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,564
- [Jeremy] What flavor did you do?

149
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,880
- Lime cream.

150
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,980
- Okay so, I ended up getting
what's called a flight here,

151
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,813
and it's where you can get

152
00:07:15,813 --> 00:07:18,950
several different
flavors, on little cones.

153
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,250
- They're so cute!

154
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,617
And yes, this is Jeremy's.

155
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:23,450
- Yeah.

156
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,990
So I gotta peanut butter
Snickers, and cool bean,

157
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,700
coconut banana macadamia
nut, black cherry chocolate

158
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,540
something something,
sorbet, and toasted coconut.

159
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,160
- Let's just say that it's
a good thing we didn't

160
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,770
discover this place at
the beginning of our trip.

161
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,710
- [Jeremy] What flavor is that?

162
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,543
- Brown sugar.

163
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,170
She really went for that!

164
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,950
Our current favorite to listen

165
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:54,094
to in the car is the Annie soundtrack.

166
00:07:54,094 --> 00:07:56,594
(all singing)

167
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:09,741
♪ You're always a day away. ♪

168
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:13,882
(reggae music)

169
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,581
- We're up in Oceanside,
walking along the pier.

170
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:22,164
(reggae music)

171
00:08:33,236 --> 00:08:35,736
(happy music)

172
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:48,596
- [Laura] There' a ton of clams.

173
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:51,096
(happy music)

174
00:08:56,073 --> 00:08:56,994
- [Kendra] Please stand back.

175
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:01,411
We are wild brown pelicans
and we bite stupid people.

176
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,570
- This is definitely the
longest pier I've walked

177
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,650
out on, and it's just
amazing to be so far out,

178
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,750
into the ocean, to look back on the shore,

179
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,440
and it's just really
peaceful and calm out here.

180
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,390
It's beautiful.

181
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,240
So how do you think they built the pier?

182
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,270
How do you come all the way out

183
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,820
into the ocean and make a pier?

184
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:21,891
- No idea.

185
00:09:21,891 --> 00:09:23,780
- [Jeremy] We're gonna have to look it up.

186
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,230
Scuba divers out here.

187
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,420
As always, Jenae is happy to
see any dogs and birds here.

188
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,380
Here comes another bird, Jenae!

189
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,213
Look!

190
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:33,779
- Ah!

191
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:39,762
- Ah!

192
00:09:41,552 --> 00:09:43,650
- I'm glad Laura's not eating
a granola bar right now.

193
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,483
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

194
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,600
She'll never eat a granola bar again.

195
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,433
Traumatized.

196
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,855
(happy music)

197
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:53,920
- Yes.

198
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,760
Jenae is cheering for the surfers.

199
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,280
(laughing)

200
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,080
- Yay!

201
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,653
I'm so glad we made it down
to the pier during sunset.

202
00:10:06,653 --> 00:10:08,964
And it's gonna be beautiful tonight.

203
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:11,631
(bells chiming)

204
00:10:12,757 --> 00:10:15,507
(tranquil music)

205
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,673
- [Boy] Good night.

206
00:10:51,961 --> 00:10:54,378
(rock music)

207
00:11:02,059 --> 00:00:00,000
(Jenae laughing)
