1
00:00:00,161 --> 00:00:01,302
- [Jeremy] Guys just chillin'?

2
00:00:01,302 --> 00:00:02,670
- We're just chatting.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:03,533
We're just chatting.

4
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,386
- [Jeremy] What do you think
sushi's gonna taste like?

5
00:00:05,386 --> 00:00:07,679
- I don't know, I'm kind of nervous.

6
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,081
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:11,081 --> 00:00:13,831
- [Jeremy] That is a goodbye hug.

8
00:00:20,393 --> 00:00:23,060
(playful music)

9
00:00:25,933 --> 00:00:27,224
- (baby laughing)

10
00:00:27,224 --> 00:00:28,986
- [Jeremy] You're a goose.

11
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,653
- (baby cooing)

12
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:36,611
- [Jeremy] Yeah, what's that?

13
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:39,444
- (baby babbling)

14
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,055
- [Jeremy] This morning
we came to hang out

15
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:46,498
with the Ballingers
where they're staying at.

16
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:48,518
Then we're going to try some food

17
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:50,978
that our family has never had.

18
00:00:50,978 --> 00:00:52,542
We're pretty excited.

19
00:00:52,542 --> 00:00:54,959
(jazz music)

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,273
Oh!

21
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:06,362
Oh!

22
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:12,300
Nice!

23
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:19,898
(guitar music)

24
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:22,661
- So what we're doing is we are going with

25
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:25,197
the Ballingers to a sushi restaurant.

26
00:01:25,197 --> 00:01:26,336
I've never had sushi.

27
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,022
My kids have never had sushi.

28
00:01:28,022 --> 00:01:30,862
Jeremy has had sushi, but
we're excited to try it.

29
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:33,779
- Poll question, do you like sushi?

30
00:01:37,105 --> 00:01:39,520
- [Jeremy] So, Isaac, how
are you feeling about sushi?

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,132
- I'm really, really, really excited.

32
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,605
- [Jeremy] What do you think
sushi's gonna taste like?

33
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,686
- I don't know.

34
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:46,898
I'm kind of nervous.

35
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:51,226
- I think it's gonna be like
a rice and fish mixture.

36
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:52,882
- I'm not having it.

37
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,099
I'm having an avocado roll.

38
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,952
- [Jeremy] I'm not having it answer.

39
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:58,527
- I like rice.
- Not feeling up to it?

40
00:01:58,527 --> 00:01:59,920
- Yay!
- Gonna have some rice?

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,636
- In our family, we
love to try new things.

42
00:02:01,636 --> 00:02:04,265
I just told the kids in the
car they can try whatever

43
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:06,679
they want and if they're not
interested, that's okay too.

44
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,002
Who knows, we might really love this.

45
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,536
It's fun to have them
here with the Ballingers

46
00:02:10,537 --> 00:02:12,329
who do love sushi.

47
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:14,288
- Yeah, they're gonna get
some serious peer pressure.

48
00:02:14,288 --> 00:02:16,035
Even if they don't get parent pressure,

49
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:18,754
they are gonna get some
real peer pressure.

50
00:02:18,754 --> 00:02:21,396
(Oriental music)

51
00:02:21,396 --> 00:02:24,024
- So apparently these are kid chopsticks

52
00:02:24,024 --> 00:02:26,636
or new people chopsticks.

53
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:29,067
- They're kid chopsticks converters.

54
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,160
- These are so easy.

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,074
This is the best device I've ever seen.

56
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,152
- Isn't it amazing?
- Yes!

57
00:02:33,152 --> 00:02:35,020
- These are kids.

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,997
- I put it down here and
then I put one that way

59
00:02:37,997 --> 00:02:39,592
and then one that way.

60
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:43,025
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop. (laughing)

61
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:45,046
- [Kendra] Now you can
use them like chopsticks.

62
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:45,956
Can you say thank you?

63
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:47,246
- Thank you.

64
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:49,692
- [Kendra] Did you just
wake up from a nap?

65
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:52,359
- She's ready to eat some sushi.

66
00:02:53,823 --> 00:02:55,677
- I'm really excited to try this

67
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:56,861
and I'm a little bit scared.

68
00:02:56,861 --> 00:02:58,608
I think I'm just gonna not
tell myself what it is.

69
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,203
Just don't think about it, eat it,

70
00:03:00,203 --> 00:03:01,904
and then I'll experience it.

71
00:03:01,904 --> 00:03:02,737
I'm gonna try it.

72
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:03,570
Miso Soup.

73
00:03:05,781 --> 00:03:06,710
What do you think?

74
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,366
Thumbs up.

75
00:03:08,366 --> 00:03:11,845
It's got broth and seaweed and tofu in it.

76
00:03:11,845 --> 00:03:14,745
- At first I thought the tofu was chicken.

77
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,979
I thought it was gonna be crunchy

78
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,303
and I was like (biting) and
it went straight through.

79
00:03:20,303 --> 00:03:21,636
I was like what?

80
00:03:22,597 --> 00:03:24,347
- [Kendra] Mmm, tofu!

81
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,383
- [Jeremy] You like Miso Soup?

82
00:03:28,383 --> 00:03:30,601
- [Kendra] Using the
chopsticks to eat edamame.

83
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,120
- Mwah!

84
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,870
(oriental music)

85
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,473
- [Server] The Rainbow,
Caterpillar, Special Eel,

86
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:50,543
Pizza, Gluten Free, Veggie
or the regular tuna roll.

87
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:52,381
- [Jeremy] There's your
avocado roll, Caleb.

88
00:03:52,381 --> 00:03:53,566
- [Kendra] Alright, Caleb,
pick up one of these

89
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,176
with your chopsticks.

90
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,893
Good job, put it on your plate.

91
00:03:56,893 --> 00:03:57,879
- [Jeremy] You can just eat it.

92
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,033
- [Kendra] Oh, you can
just eat it Dad said.

93
00:03:59,033 --> 00:04:01,450
- [Jeremy] Yeah, just eat it.

94
00:04:03,927 --> 00:04:05,606
- So I just put the
whole thing in my mouth?

95
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:08,273
- [Jeremy] Yeah, just pop it in.

96
00:04:10,737 --> 00:04:11,737
You like it?

97
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,012
- [Kendra] Which one are
you gonna try first Lisey?

98
00:04:15,012 --> 00:04:16,166
- [Mom Ballinger] This is
the eel roll, which I--

99
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,944
- I love sushi!

100
00:04:17,945 --> 00:04:19,281
- [Jeremy] Awesome!

101
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:22,031
(relaxing music)

102
00:04:28,014 --> 00:04:29,427
That was a little bite.

103
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:31,052
The Ballingers have a
tradition that they do

104
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:33,437
a sushi dance when they eat sushi.

105
00:04:33,437 --> 00:04:36,384
So we thought we would join
them for the sushi dance.

106
00:04:36,384 --> 00:04:38,920
(upbeat music)

107
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,087
♪ Dancing ♪

108
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:45,833
We are sad.

109
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,243
We're gonna have to say
goodbye to the Ballingers.

110
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,232
Of course we'll leave a link
to their channel as well

111
00:04:49,232 --> 00:04:50,250
to check them out.

112
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,167
We love the Ballingers.

113
00:04:58,193 --> 00:05:00,016
(children yelling)

114
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:00,849
It's time to say goodbye.

115
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,898
Oh, there we go.

116
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:03,731
- Bye.

117
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,138
- [Jeremy] That is a goodbye hug.

118
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:12,361
(upbeat music)

119
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:25,698
Well the kids did have a hard time

120
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:26,804
saying goodby to the Ballingers,

121
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:28,991
but we're back at our
place and we are expecting

122
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:32,095
some special visitors in just a moment.

123
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:33,107
Guys just chillin'?

124
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:34,550
- We're just chatting.

125
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,674
We're just chatting.

126
00:05:35,674 --> 00:05:37,937
- [Jeremy] Say, Elise, what
were your thoughts of sushi.

127
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:39,320
- I liked it!

128
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,132
But it hasn't been like my total favorite.

129
00:05:43,132 --> 00:05:44,194
- [Jeremy] You guys.

130
00:05:44,194 --> 00:05:45,153
- Are they here?

131
00:05:45,153 --> 00:05:46,903
- [Jeremy] Come here.

132
00:05:48,129 --> 00:05:49,462
- [All] Grandma!

133
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,442
- Who gave you that shirt.

134
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:53,275
I really like it.

135
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:54,883
- You like that shirt, huh?

136
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:56,523
- [Jeremy] It's Bubba and Maga!

137
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:57,856
- Hey toothless!

138
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,214
- [Grandma] I think you grew taller!

139
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:03,171
- Naenae was inside,
hearing all the excitement.

140
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,177
She was like let me come!

141
00:06:05,177 --> 00:06:06,344
Ah, say hello.

142
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,459
- Grandma!

143
00:06:09,459 --> 00:06:10,810
- Hi honey, how are you?

144
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,846
How are you doing?

145
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,501
I missed you.

146
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:17,053
I haven't seen you since Thanksgiving!

147
00:06:17,053 --> 00:06:18,010
- I know!

148
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,498
- Have you been growing taller?

149
00:06:19,498 --> 00:06:20,334
- Yeah.

150
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,217
- Did you notice that
I wore my JHouse shirt?

151
00:06:22,217 --> 00:06:23,052
- Yeah.

152
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:24,267
- [Kendra] Did you show
Grandma your teeth?

153
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,558
- Yeah.

154
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:29,554
(kids background chattering)

155
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:31,471
- Where's the bathroom?

156
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:34,622
- We're finding hide outs.

157
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:45,145
- Dad, watch, look how much better it is.

158
00:06:45,145 --> 00:06:47,089
- [Jeremy] Did Papa
come and fix the toilet?

159
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:48,349
- It's a leverage problem.

160
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,175
- Yeah, it was a little hard to push.

161
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,451
Papa's doing some basketball instructions

162
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,470
for Isaac and Caleb.

163
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,382
- Okay, you got to center it up

164
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,248
on the point of this ball.

165
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:57,828
That's the person's shoulder.

166
00:06:57,828 --> 00:06:59,710
Then you pivot off of this foot.

167
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,490
Then I drop it into you and you score.

168
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,357
- [Jeremy] Pick and roll.

169
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,192
- Pick and roll.

170
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:05,635
Run and stand.

171
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,078
- [Jeremy] And then you break away.

172
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,611
- Remember how you pivot.

173
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:10,327
You pivot on that foot.

174
00:07:10,327 --> 00:07:12,456
And go and I toss it to you and you--

175
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:14,535
- [Jeremy] Boom.

176
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,765
- You got it!

177
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,163
- All the magic ends on this block--

178
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,757
Did I wish to go to the
ball, said Cinderella?

179
00:07:18,757 --> 00:07:20,322
I did wish to go--

180
00:07:20,322 --> 00:07:22,888
- So Jeremy and I are
on a quick little date,

181
00:07:22,888 --> 00:07:24,377
which means we're really
just running an errand.

182
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,276
We're going to Trader Joe's together,

183
00:07:26,276 --> 00:07:29,571
but it feels magically delicious.

184
00:07:29,571 --> 00:07:31,242
- Cause it's just us and Naenae.

185
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,918
You guys know how much I love sunsets.

186
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:35,024
There's not a lot of fog today

187
00:07:35,024 --> 00:07:36,725
so you can like see the ocean better

188
00:07:36,725 --> 00:07:38,304
than we've been able to see
it since we've been here.

189
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:41,137
The sun is setting into the ocean.

190
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,078
It's awesome!

191
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,730
(piano music)

192
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,507
- The sun is going into the water.

193
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:56,076
- The sun's going down in the water.

194
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,032
- [Jeremy] Crazy, huh?

195
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:57,865
- Yeah.

196
00:07:57,865 --> 00:07:58,961
- [Jeremy] It's just what it looks like.

197
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,480
It isn't actually going into the ocean.

198
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,471
It's just the Earth is rotating around it.

199
00:08:03,471 --> 00:08:05,971
(piano music)

200
00:08:09,016 --> 00:08:09,849
- That was amazing.

201
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:11,547
- [Jeremy] The sun set.

202
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:13,263
Caleb what are you
helping me with right now?

203
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:17,819
- I'm helping you with the
video that's coming up tomorrow.

204
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:20,645
You should watch it, it's super funny.

205
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,761
- [Jeremy] (laughing) Yep,
so Caleb's helping me edit.

206
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,261
(piano music)

207
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,178
- Open the tank valve all the way.

208
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,264
- They have a propane fireplace
and we're gonna try it.

209
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:37,736
- [Kendra] With the igniter button, push--

210
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:40,242
- [Jeremy] There we go.

211
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:41,410
Alright, fire!

212
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,136
- (laughing)

213
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:51,227
(upbeat music)

214
00:08:54,064 --> 00:08:56,786
- So I think this is my
new favorite place to work

215
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,689
watching the sunset, working on a video.

216
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:04,106
- [Kendra] Nice, you've even got company.

217
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:06,808
- [Jeremy] What's for dinner?

218
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:07,916
- I don't know what to call this.

219
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,407
It's chicken and peppers and beans.

220
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:11,835
- [Jeremy] I think it's fajitas.

221
00:09:11,835 --> 00:09:13,096
- We're gonna put it on top of rice

222
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:15,055
and inside of tortillas.

223
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,321
Ooh, my favorite thing from Trader Joe's.

224
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,280
Handmade flour tortillas.

225
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,313
They're so good.

226
00:09:21,313 --> 00:09:22,211
- [Jeremy] They are good.

227
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,774
- [Grandma] And avocado,
and tomatoes, and--

228
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,854
- [Kendra] Yes, that's the
present that says everything.

229
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:26,871
- [Jeremy] Want some chips.

230
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:29,196
- [Kendra] Alright, here's dinner.

231
00:09:29,196 --> 00:09:31,779
(guitar music)

232
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,787
Family dinner.

233
00:09:38,551 --> 00:09:41,194
- [Jeremy] We started the fireplace.

234
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,470
- It's going pretty high.

235
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,442
- [Jeremy] Is it warm?

236
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:46,237
- Can we get it a little bit bigger?

237
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:47,315
- [Jeremy] Well, that's pretty big.

238
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:48,982
Don't get too close.

239
00:09:50,064 --> 00:09:51,750
- There was a wild rush for the wharf

240
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,831
and when Jack turned
Crazeworthy was no longer

241
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,411
standing beside him.

242
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,628
- [Laura] Goodnight, Jhouse out.

243
00:09:57,628 --> 00:09:59,845
- [Isaac] Hi Ballingers!

244
00:09:59,845 --> 00:10:01,106
- I lost my tooth!

245
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,523
- What's a koala?

246
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:06,134
- [Jeremy] I just thought
I'd go for a roll.

247
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:07,384
- It's a panda!

248
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,714
- [Kendra] What is going on?

249
00:10:11,647 --> 00:00:00,000
(jazz music)
