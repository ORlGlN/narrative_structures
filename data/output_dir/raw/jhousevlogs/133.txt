1
00:00:00,798 --> 00:00:02,354
- There is a world record for the person

2
00:00:02,354 --> 00:00:06,185
who can snort the most
times in 10 seconds.

3
00:00:06,185 --> 00:00:09,436
(snorting)
(playful music)

4
00:00:09,436 --> 00:00:11,735
(screaming)

5
00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:12,757
- [Jeremy] How do you feel?

6
00:00:12,757 --> 00:00:14,127
You just broke a world record.

7
00:00:14,127 --> 00:00:14,960
- Awesome!

8
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:19,101
(gentle music)

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,673
(upbeat music)

10
00:00:27,594 --> 00:00:29,475
- So, we got a box in the
mail today from Amazon.

11
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:32,122
And I'm excited to show
the kids what's inside.

12
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,862
(upbeat music)

13
00:00:34,862 --> 00:00:35,837
- What is it?

14
00:00:35,837 --> 00:00:36,998
- Yeah, what?

15
00:00:36,998 --> 00:00:38,748
- It's Amazon Rapids.

16
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:44,286
- So, Amazon Rapids is a reading app

17
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:46,167
that you can get on a tablet or a device.

18
00:00:46,167 --> 00:00:48,721
And it reads you these
stories and you can read them.

19
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,161
- Can we read this story?

20
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:51,063
- You wanna read this one?

21
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:52,084
- Yeah.

22
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,454
- [Kendra] So this is called
Niko and the Sword of Light

23
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:54,801
and this story's called Danger and Eggs.

24
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:57,541
These books are from
shows on Amazon Prime.

25
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,074
They're Amazon original
shows that now also books

26
00:00:59,074 --> 00:01:00,792
on Amazon Rapids.

27
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:01,976
- Can we read this one?

28
00:01:01,976 --> 00:01:03,509
- Yeah, does it look cool?

29
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:04,971
- Do you wanna check out the app?

30
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:06,759
Okay, go ahead and click on Amazon Rapids.

31
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,431
Alright, we're gonna set up a profile.

32
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,194
Do your age and you get
to create an avatar.

33
00:01:11,194 --> 00:01:13,075
- [Kendra] Oh, choose a fun one.

34
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:14,608
- That one's so cool.

35
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,885
- That is a good one.

36
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:17,092
The ninja.

37
00:01:17,092 --> 00:01:18,950
- As a mom with several
young, new readers,

38
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,434
I'm always looking for ways
to sneak in more reading time.

39
00:01:21,434 --> 00:01:23,826
So I'm excited about this
reading app Amazon Rapids,

40
00:01:23,826 --> 00:01:26,287
because since it's on the
device, the kids wanna

41
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,588
be on their devices anyway.

42
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:29,190
So this is a way that they
can turn their device time

43
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,560
into reading time.

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,837
And we're grateful to Amazon Rapids

45
00:01:31,837 --> 00:01:33,462
for reaching out and
sponsoring our video today.

46
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:35,250
Okay, we we're gonna scroll through here

47
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:37,386
and this shows you all the
stories that are in here.

48
00:01:37,386 --> 00:01:39,430
Look, they add new stories all the time.

49
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,496
So here's where they post the new ones.

50
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:43,354
Here's Niko and the Sword of Light.

51
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,724
Do you wanna hit that one?

52
00:01:44,724 --> 00:01:46,442
We're going to read along.

53
00:01:46,442 --> 00:01:47,442
Ready along.

54
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:51,388
- [Computer] I am Niko and
this is my sword of light.

55
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:55,916
I'm here to free my people and
defeat the darkness forever.

56
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:58,633
- So Caleb, these voices are
the same voices from the show.

57
00:01:58,633 --> 00:01:59,910
- Can I read this one?

58
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,862
- Yeah, go for it.

59
00:02:00,862 --> 00:02:03,161
- Gimme the rundown, Phillip.

60
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:04,600
- [Kendra] Hit that one.

61
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,481
According to my notes, with last week's

62
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:08,710
Park World Record for
most detailed grass angel

63
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:11,102
combined with yesterday's
longest oboe blow,

64
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:12,185
you have set,

65
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:15,374
- [Elise] We have set.

66
00:02:15,374 --> 00:02:17,487
- [Kendra] Aww, thank you D.D.

67
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:22,038
We have set a grand total of
54 official park world records.

68
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:25,173
- [Elise] We will be
sitting, what's that word?

69
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:27,054
- [Kendra] Touch it and here it.

70
00:02:27,054 --> 00:02:28,169
- [Computer] Awesome.

71
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:29,190
- Awesome?

72
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,582
We will be sitting awesome.

73
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:32,511
- [Kendra] Are you injured?

74
00:02:32,511 --> 00:02:34,136
- My spleen is fine?

75
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,158
- Do you know what a spleen is?

76
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,179
- No.

77
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,201
- Okay, hold your finger down on it

78
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,175
and it'll tell you.

79
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:43,099
A spleen in an organ
located near your stomach.

80
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,631
- [Computer] I'm very familiar with the

81
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,930
official park world
records rule book rules.

82
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,692
When attempting the park world record

83
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:53,943
for most bikes ridden by
one person at one time.

84
00:02:53,943 --> 00:02:55,893
- [Kendra] Right here,
this is the glossary

85
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:59,144
and it shows us all the words
that we've learned about.

86
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,536
- [Elise] Like this one.

87
00:03:01,536 --> 00:03:03,231
- [Kendra] Awesome.

88
00:03:03,231 --> 00:03:04,252
- Phillip, that's it.

89
00:03:04,252 --> 00:03:05,622
- Really?

90
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:09,291
- Well sort of, I challenge
you to a staring contest.

91
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:11,520
- So they're gonna try
to break the world record

92
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,564
staring contest.

93
00:03:13,564 --> 00:03:14,841
Do you wanna try it?

94
00:03:14,841 --> 00:03:15,862
- Yeah.

95
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,232
- Do you wanna try a staring
contest with me right now?

96
00:03:17,232 --> 00:03:18,300
- Yeah.

97
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,369
- Ready,

98
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:20,390
set,

99
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,223
go.

100
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,243
My eyes are already burning.

101
00:03:25,243 --> 00:03:28,587
(techno music)

102
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:30,282
Come on, come on.

103
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:31,115
I blinked.

104
00:03:33,092 --> 00:03:34,554
- I won.

105
00:03:34,554 --> 00:03:36,249
- So there actually is a world record

106
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,875
for the longest staring contest.

107
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,104
Do you guys have any
guesses how long it is?

108
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,985
- Six minutes.

109
00:03:41,985 --> 00:03:43,564
- An hour.
- An hour.

110
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,468
- I looked it up and the
world record for staring

111
00:03:45,468 --> 00:03:47,885
is 40 minutes and 59 seconds.

112
00:03:49,322 --> 00:03:50,506
- Caleb has it.

113
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:51,714
- [Jeremy] Caleb was close.

114
00:03:51,714 --> 00:03:53,061
- [Kendra] You were close dude.

115
00:03:53,061 --> 00:03:54,733
So as we're looking into
the world records that are

116
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:57,171
out there, there are world
records for the craziest stuff.

117
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:00,236
There's a world record for
the person who can sort

118
00:04:00,236 --> 00:04:02,883
the most times in 10 seconds.

119
00:04:02,883 --> 00:04:03,904
Go!

120
00:04:03,904 --> 00:04:06,154
(snorting)

121
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,536
Nice job Leesy, that
was a ton of snorting.

122
00:04:16,536 --> 00:04:17,786
Ready, set, go.

123
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,574
(snorting)

124
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:22,504
Go!

125
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:24,477
(snorting)

126
00:04:24,477 --> 00:04:26,727
(laughter)

127
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:34,021
It's hard to snort and
laugh at the same time.

128
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:35,832
- [Caleb] No, it's more than 12.

129
00:04:35,832 --> 00:04:37,016
- [Jeremy] Time's up.

130
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,266
(snorting)

131
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:41,892
- [Kendra] Stop.

132
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:43,332
That was a ton.

133
00:04:43,332 --> 00:04:45,816
- [Jeremy] She's focusing her chi.

134
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,419
- On my nose.

135
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:49,810
- [Jeremy] That was one.

136
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,143
(snorting and laughter)

137
00:04:54,265 --> 00:04:55,348
Seven, eight,

138
00:04:56,727 --> 00:04:57,560
nine, ten.

139
00:05:03,646 --> 00:05:06,200
Your first snort was three seconds long.

140
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,988
- I was going for most unique snort.

141
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:10,238
(laughter)

142
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,283
Did I get longest snort maybe?

143
00:05:13,283 --> 00:05:14,283
- [Girl] Go.

144
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:17,718
(snorting)

145
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:20,301
(upbeat music)

146
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:22,501
Stop.

147
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,751
(laughter)

148
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,513
- There wasn't enough oxygen coming in.

149
00:05:29,513 --> 00:05:30,860
- Alright, well we need to look up

150
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,345
what the world record is for
most snorts in 10 seconds.

151
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:35,295
But first we want you to pause this video,

152
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:37,362
snort for 10 seconds and let us know

153
00:05:37,362 --> 00:05:39,219
how many you get in the comments.

154
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,845
Alright, we looked it
up and the world record

155
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:43,585
for snorting in 10 seconds is 58 snorts.

156
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:46,371
- At least we did win
one world record today,

157
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,454
cutest baby in the world.

158
00:05:49,297 --> 00:05:50,318
- [Kendra] There she is.

159
00:05:50,318 --> 00:05:51,735
You did it Jenae.

160
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,219
- We did it.

161
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:56,727
- [Kendra] Alright, but
here's what really matters,

162
00:05:56,727 --> 00:05:59,144
how many times can you snort?

163
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:01,822
- Can you snort?

164
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:05,977
- [Kendra] Wait, I think I heard her.

165
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:09,837
(laughter)

166
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,370
- The next world record
we're gonna try to break

167
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,740
is on the trampoline.

168
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,620
It's how many times you can
go from your bum to your feet

169
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,787
in one minute.

170
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:17,941
42,

171
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:18,939
43,

172
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:20,077
44,

173
00:06:20,077 --> 00:06:21,354
45,

174
00:06:21,354 --> 00:06:22,631
46,

175
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:24,094
Stop!

176
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:27,511
You were only three away from the record.

177
00:06:29,365 --> 00:06:30,198
Good job.

178
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:36,029
You were only three away
from the world record.

179
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,237
- Yeah.

180
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,351
- [Jeremy] You were working hard.

181
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:40,601
(laughter)

182
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,576
- Our next contestant, Isaac.

183
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:47,802
(cheers)

184
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:49,009
- [Jeremy] Go, one,

185
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,031
two,

186
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,053
three,

187
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,005
four,

188
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,628
(upbeat music)

189
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:55,673
45,

190
00:06:55,673 --> 00:06:56,695
46,

191
00:06:56,695 --> 00:06:57,717
47,

192
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:58,645
48,

193
00:06:58,645 --> 00:06:59,667
49,

194
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:00,689
50,

195
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,641
51,

196
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:02,662
52,

197
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:03,684
53,

198
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,217
Stop!

199
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,494
53!

200
00:07:06,494 --> 00:07:09,077
The world record holder, Isaac.

201
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:13,483
How do you feel, you just
broke a world record.

202
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:14,316
- Awesome.

203
00:07:15,898 --> 00:07:17,755
- [Jeremy] That was
amazing, did you have 53?

204
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,056
- Yeah!

205
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,639
(upbeat music)

206
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:24,071
- Well I got 48 which was just

207
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:26,045
one short of the world record.

208
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,251
I don't know how they're
counting a seat drop though.

209
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,387
Maybe we're getting the wrong technique,

210
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:34,520
but if not, Isaac is
the world record holder.

211
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,285
- Alright, you guys see what I have here?

212
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:37,307
- Chocolate candy.

213
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:38,839
- Chocolate candy.

214
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,068
So here's the world record
we're gonna try to break.

215
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:43,715
We're gonna see how many
chocolate candies you can eat

216
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:47,802
in one minute using chop
sticks, blindfolded.

217
00:07:47,802 --> 00:07:50,385
(upbeat music)

218
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:56,869
- I'm gonna do it backwards.

219
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,495
(giggles and cheers)

220
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,084
(giggles)

221
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,700
- [Jeremy] Disqualified.

222
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,632
- [Kendra] Whoa.

223
00:08:15,527 --> 00:08:18,615
You got two of them, good job.

224
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,865
For the world record is 20.

225
00:08:22,795 --> 00:08:25,093
- [Jeremy] Will she get
one is the question.

226
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:27,548
- Use the other side.

227
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,358
- I'm trying to use it the way it's-

228
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,525
(giggles)

229
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:39,669
- Mom, use it like a spoon.

230
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,752
(cheers)

231
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:44,615
- I'm not trying to break the record,

232
00:08:44,615 --> 00:08:47,115
I just want a chocolate candy.

233
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,953
- [Jeremy] You didn't get one.

234
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:53,036
There you go.

235
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:01,274
(cheers)

236
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:09,623
- I don't want my sleeve to get wet.

237
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:10,970
- [Jeremy] So you pulled the sleeves up?

238
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,553
(upbeat music)

239
00:09:17,727 --> 00:09:19,608
So I wonder what the world record is

240
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:21,906
for the longest time to brush your teeth.

241
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,532
- I'm going for that.

242
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:24,623
- [Jeremy] You're going for it?

243
00:09:24,623 --> 00:09:25,993
- So Jeremy and I try to be really careful

244
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:27,874
about which brands we
work with here on J House.

245
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:30,358
We know it's a good fit

246
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,913
when we are genuinely loving the product

247
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:34,352
and excited to tell our friends.

248
00:09:34,352 --> 00:09:36,233
Right now our kids are in the other room,

249
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,951
I can see them, sitting over there

250
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:39,995
and they're all snuggled up reading some

251
00:09:39,995 --> 00:09:42,108
of the stories on Amazon
Rapids on their own.

252
00:09:42,108 --> 00:09:43,919
Not because we're videoing them.

253
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,218
Today, every friend that I saw,

254
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:50,072
I had to tell them
about the Amazon Rapids.

255
00:09:50,072 --> 00:09:52,951
- [Jeremy] The fake cough.

256
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:55,529
One other cool thing about Amazon Rapids

257
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:58,153
is that it connects to the Echo,

258
00:09:58,153 --> 00:10:00,893
which you've all seen that we love to use.

259
00:10:00,893 --> 00:10:03,133
The story time skill can be used

260
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:06,291
with the books Danger and Eggs,
Niko and the Sword of Light

261
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:09,286
on Amazon Rapids by
doing this simple thing.

262
00:10:09,286 --> 00:10:10,215
You guys, watch this.

263
00:10:10,215 --> 00:10:12,769
Alexia, read me a bedtime story.

264
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:15,440
- [Echo] Resuming, The
Swamp of Sorrow Part one

265
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,531
by Patrick _.

266
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:17,529
- I read this one.

267
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:18,574
- [Echo] I'm here to free my people

268
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,200
and to defeat the darkness.

269
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,451
We have set a grand total of 54 official

270
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:25,053
park world records.

271
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,492
- We wanna thank Amazon Rapids for

272
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:27,886

00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:38,892
