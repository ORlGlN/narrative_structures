1
00:00:00,293 --> 00:00:02,882
- That was so clever, it was right here!

2
00:00:02,882 --> 00:00:04,327
- [Man] In your jacket pocket?

3
00:00:04,327 --> 00:00:06,278
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,278 --> 00:00:08,426
(laughs)

5
00:00:08,426 --> 00:00:09,718
- [Woman] Oh my goodness, you guys.

6
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:10,597
- There!

7
00:00:10,597 --> 00:00:12,942
- [Woman] Oh, she's getting two at a time.

8
00:00:12,942 --> 00:00:13,818
- Excited.

9
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:15,396
- [Woman] What are you so excited for?

10
00:00:15,396 --> 00:00:17,979
(upbeat music)

11
00:00:20,028 --> 00:00:21,110
- [Man] Good morning, Namy.

12
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,059
(gurgles)

13
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,135
Did you find eggs?

14
00:00:26,135 --> 00:00:27,669
It's Easter.

15
00:00:27,669 --> 00:00:29,836
(gurgles)

16
00:00:33,777 --> 00:00:35,128
- Good morning and happy Easter,

17
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:37,288
we're starting our Easter Sunday off

18
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:39,320
with opening some special glitter eggs

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,948
that have different scripture verses,

20
00:00:41,948 --> 00:00:44,743
and songs, and things to help us remember

21
00:00:44,743 --> 00:00:47,560
our savior and the purpose of the holiday.

22
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,201
- [Man] Alright, Laura, you pick an egg.

23
00:00:49,201 --> 00:00:50,418
Open it up.

24
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:53,756
(upbeat music)

25
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:57,108
- Follow him, Easter video cartoon.

26
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:58,863
- [Man] You guys want to
watch an Easter video?

27
00:00:58,863 --> 00:01:00,703
- [Narrator] Jesus Christ
spoke these simple words

28
00:01:00,703 --> 00:01:04,078
to his closest friends,
and his invitation.

29
00:01:04,078 --> 00:01:06,746
(upbeat music)

30
00:01:06,746 --> 00:01:07,913
- Matthew: 20.

31
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,911
- [Man] It's a scripture
from the new testament.

32
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:15,843
- And behold one of them
which were with Jesus

33
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:17,358
stretched out his hand.

34
00:01:17,358 --> 00:01:20,359
(upbeat music)

35
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,925
- So I really appreciate
this idea that Kendra had

36
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:26,176
about thinking about Jesus
in a fun way as a family,

37
00:01:26,176 --> 00:01:28,724
before we do anything else on Easter.

38
00:01:28,724 --> 00:01:32,879
- I'm grateful that Jesus set
a really good example for us.

39
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,667
- I'm grateful that
Jesus died on the cross.

40
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:38,915
- I'm grateful for him dying on the cross.

41
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:43,745
- I'm grateful that he
healed people from the dead.

42
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:46,011
- I'm grateful for the comfort and hope

43
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:48,687
that our savior Jesus
Christ gives us during life.

44
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:49,963
- I'm grateful that what Jesus did

45
00:01:49,963 --> 00:01:52,930
makes it possible for us
to have second chances.

46
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,345
To be clean, to be better.

47
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:58,699
(upbeat music)

48
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,753
- Easter morning breakfast
is strawberry milk,

49
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:03,780
cinnamon rolls, strawberries,
and hard-boiled eggs.

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,846
The decorated kind.

51
00:02:04,846 --> 00:02:06,485
You guys did a great job on these.

52
00:02:06,485 --> 00:02:10,763
- Do you want some
strawberry milk, pretty girl?

53
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,208
(laughs)

54
00:02:12,208 --> 00:02:13,794
- [Kendra] That's her first time.

55
00:02:13,794 --> 00:02:16,980
("Eine kleine Nachtmusik" by W.A. Mozart)

56
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,730
- And look at my one.

57
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,753
- [Kendra] We're peeling
and eating all of our eggs.

58
00:02:22,753 --> 00:02:24,243
- This year, for the egg hunt,

59
00:02:24,243 --> 00:02:27,326
each kid is looking for their own color.

60
00:02:27,326 --> 00:02:28,714
This made it possible for us to hide

61
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:32,944
Isaac's and Elise's a lot
harder than Jenay and Laura's.

62
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,622
(shrieks)
- [Kendra] Da da. Come on!

63
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,956
Let's go, whoa!

64
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:40,475
- [Man] This is her first
real Easter egg hunt.

65
00:02:40,475 --> 00:02:42,188
- Go get some eggs.

66
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:43,938
- [Man] Look, an egg.

67
00:02:45,502 --> 00:02:47,132
Put it in your bucket.

68
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:47,965
Yay!

69
00:02:47,965 --> 00:02:49,965
(claps)

70
00:02:51,106 --> 00:02:53,123
- [Kendra] Yay! (claps)

71
00:02:53,123 --> 00:02:56,113
Oh, she's getting two at a time!

72
00:02:56,113 --> 00:02:59,155
- [Man] Yay!
(claps)

73
00:02:59,155 --> 00:03:00,373
(cheers)

74
00:03:00,373 --> 00:03:02,540
(gurgles)

75
00:03:05,157 --> 00:03:07,990
- She's like, get it in there.
- [Man] Good job!

76
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,509
She's like, look at her hair go.

77
00:03:10,509 --> 00:03:11,524
She's going.

78
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,316
- [Kendra] She's on a
mission to her next one.

79
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:15,627
- Jenay has accidentally
gotten a couple of yours.

80
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:17,647
(rattles)

81
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,976
(laughs)

82
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,825
- So Laura you're looking for
pink and purple eggs, okay?

83
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:23,976
(classical music)

84
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:25,476
Whoa, she's on it!

85
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,737
- [Man] Good find.

86
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:32,654
- Hey, one right there.

87
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:36,457
- [Kendra] They're going
to get harder and harder.

88
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:38,457
Oh, that was a hard one!

89
00:03:40,073 --> 00:03:41,339
- [Man] Good find!

90
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:43,544
- Caleb you are blue!

91
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:45,076
- Is this mine?

92
00:03:45,076 --> 00:03:47,399
- [Kendra] Yep.
- [Man] Yeah.

93
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:49,982
(upbeat music)

94
00:03:57,326 --> 00:03:58,201
- There!

95
00:03:58,201 --> 00:04:00,918
- [Man] Yeah, Olin found one.

96
00:04:00,918 --> 00:04:03,512
- Is there anymore? (gasps)

97
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:06,179
- Elise is up and she is yellow.

98
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,158
- (gasps) There one is! (laughs)

99
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,743
- [Man] Someone has a yellow one. (laughs)

100
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:20,192
- Naynay has an egg, yellow one!

101
00:04:20,192 --> 00:04:22,275
(shouts)

102
00:04:24,012 --> 00:04:25,717
- One more.

103
00:04:25,717 --> 00:04:28,342
- Isaac, you are green.

104
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,329
Good luck.

105
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,203
- They are not easy to find, friend.

106
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:34,370
(rattles)

107
00:04:38,704 --> 00:04:39,894
- [Kendra] You're gettin' really close!

108
00:04:39,894 --> 00:04:43,120
(claps) You found it, don't open 'em!

109
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,231
- [Man] So what's funny, Isaac,

110
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:48,021
is you have passed by several of the eggs.

111
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,444
Where you looked in the place

112
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,217
where the eggs were, and didn't find them.

113
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:53,634
You keep going right by them.

114
00:04:54,638 --> 00:04:57,240
(laughs) Good one.

115
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,579
So you already went
down, touched the ball,

116
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,870
and didn't see the egg. (laughs)

117
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,953
- (gasps) Is it inside of there?

118
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:11,789
(laughs)

119
00:05:12,802 --> 00:05:14,664
- [Man] Okay, how many more
do you need now, Isaac?

120
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,779
- Five more?

121
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:16,790
- [Man] How many more do you need?

122
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,798
- Four.

123
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:19,933
(upbeat music)

124
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:23,766
- [Man] (whispers) good find.

125
00:05:24,621 --> 00:05:26,292
- [Child] Oh my, that one.

126
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,294
- [Kendra] You're really
warm, oh colder, colder!

127
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:31,877
Warmer, warmer, you are so hot!

128
00:05:34,112 --> 00:05:36,164
You are so hot.

129
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:38,119
(laughs)

130
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,516
So all the toys down here actually

131
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:42,201
make it really hard to find all the eggs.

132
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:44,265
- (laughs) That was so good!

133
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:46,912
- [Man] Earlier you
went right by that one.

134
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:50,046
- That was so clever, it was right here!

135
00:05:50,046 --> 00:05:51,529
- [Man] In your jacket pocket?

136
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:54,109
- Uh-huh, I only have one
more and it's so tough.

137
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,361
- So Elise has one egg left,

138
00:05:56,361 --> 00:05:57,644
and she and I both can't find it.

139
00:05:57,644 --> 00:05:59,151
Like, I'm looking with her.

140
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,436
I have no idea where this egg is.

141
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:02,532
Well I finally found Elise's last egg,

142
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:04,871
and so we're gonna do hot
and cold while she finds it.

143
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:06,788
Warmer, warmer, warmer.

144
00:06:08,737 --> 00:06:09,570
Colder.

145
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,038
Warmer.

146
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:15,117
Colder, colder, colder!

147
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:16,639
Warmer.

148
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,350
Oh your feet are on fire!

149
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,183
(shrieks)

150
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,806
(laughs)

151
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:24,873
- It was hard, but I got it!

152
00:06:24,873 --> 00:06:26,793
- [Kendra] You got it,
the yellow on yellow.

153
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:28,693
- It's the exact yellow.

154
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,243
- [Kendra] It is, yes,
you found all your eggs!

155
00:06:31,243 --> 00:06:32,390
Are you ready to come play?

156
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,223
- Uh-huh.

157
00:06:33,223 --> 00:06:34,393
- [Kendra] So what's
inside your eggs this year?

158
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:35,775
- [Children] Legos!

159
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,265
- [Kendra] Alright, open 'em up.

160
00:06:37,265 --> 00:06:39,848
(upbeat music)

161
00:06:43,995 --> 00:06:47,086
So this is gonna be Laura's
very first lego set.

162
00:06:47,086 --> 00:06:49,196
- Where's the destruction?

163
00:06:49,196 --> 00:06:50,228
- [Kendra] The what?

164
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:51,813
- The destructions.

165
00:06:51,813 --> 00:06:53,445
- [Kendra] The instructions?

166
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,278
- Yeah.

167
00:06:54,278 --> 00:06:55,224
- [Kendra] Okay, I'll go
grab the instructions.

168
00:06:55,224 --> 00:06:58,022
Here's Laura's, you got
a snow white castle.

169
00:06:58,022 --> 00:06:59,927
You're gonna build that.

170
00:06:59,927 --> 00:07:01,844
Mister Caleb,
- Oh yeah!

171
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:03,662
- [Kendra] You're going to build

172
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:04,611
whichever one of those three you want.

173
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,528
Leesy,
- Oh, a race car.

174
00:07:08,912 --> 00:07:09,796
- [Kendra] There's Isaac.

175
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,268
- So I can build any of them?

176
00:07:11,268 --> 00:07:12,146
- [Kendra] Yeah.

177
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:13,646
- This is so cool!

178
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:19,551
- [Kendra] Did you put
snow white together?

179
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,384
Good job.

180
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:24,034
Okay then, you read the
instructions for the next one.

181
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:25,747
So Isaac, Elise, and Caleb all got these

182
00:07:25,747 --> 00:07:27,257
creator three-in-one sets.

183
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:28,615
So you can make three different things

184
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,146
with the same set of legos.

185
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:32,128
- I think this is bringing a lot more joy

186
00:07:32,128 --> 00:07:34,795
to the family than, like, candy.

187
00:07:36,307 --> 00:07:37,792
- [Kendra] You think so?

188
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,907
We did not tell you to say that.

189
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,258
So we decided to do no candy
in Easter eggs this year,

190
00:07:42,258 --> 00:07:43,958
and I'd warned the kids about that,

191
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,775
that there wasn't going to be
any candy in the Easter eggs,

192
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:47,598
and they've been a little
concerned about it.

193
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:49,494
So I'm glad to hear that
they're liking this.

194
00:07:49,494 --> 00:07:52,077
(upbeat music)

195
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:54,845
- Excited!

196
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,449
- [Kendra] What are you so excited for?

197
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,843
- For a new dress!

198
00:07:57,843 --> 00:07:59,783
- [Kendra] We're getting
new Easter dresses,

199
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:00,728
so the girls haven't seen

200
00:08:00,728 --> 00:08:02,962
their new Easter dresses
yet, but guess what?

201
00:08:02,962 --> 00:08:05,448
We did something that
we've never done before.

202
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:09,001
We got matching for you,
and Laura, and Jenay,

203
00:08:09,001 --> 00:08:10,777
you guys all have matching dresses.

204
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:11,741
- And you!

205
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,709
- [Kendra] Unfortunately, I don't.

206
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:14,867
Shall we do that some time?

207
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:15,700
- Yeah.

208
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:17,796
- [Kendra] Okay, that's
some real excitement.

209
00:08:17,796 --> 00:08:19,043
Okay, I'll go get the dresses.

210
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:21,131
(classical music)

211
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:22,776
And open!

212
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:24,887
(shrieks)
- It's so cute!

213
00:08:24,887 --> 00:08:25,720
- So cute!

214
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:30,188
- [Kendra] You guys wanna wear 'em today?

215
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,231
What do you guys think of your shirts?

216
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:33,933
- They're not,
- Awesome.

217
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,628
- I didn't expect it.

218
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:36,462
- [Man] They're pink.

219
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:37,596
- So the girls have navy dresses

220
00:08:37,596 --> 00:08:40,162
and I thought the pink
went really well with it.

221
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,299
- I'm okay with it, I like pink.

222
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,046
- We're hosting Easter
dinner tonight for our family

223
00:08:44,046 --> 00:08:46,164
and for Jeremy's brother and his family.

224
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:48,914
And we're having ham, and
usually I cook our hams

225
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:52,579
in the crock pot, but it doesn't fit.

226
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:54,483
It's too big.

227
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,466
I read online and online has

228
00:08:56,466 --> 00:08:58,198
lots of truths in it,
- [Jeremy] It must be true.

229
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,031
- (laughs) right?

230
00:08:59,031 --> 00:08:59,981
I read online that you can

231
00:08:59,981 --> 00:09:01,995
actually cook a ham in a paper bag.

232
00:09:01,995 --> 00:09:05,649
Like, just drop the ham in
the paper bag and bake it.

233
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,753
And they say it's really
good so we're gonna try it,

234
00:09:07,753 --> 00:09:08,903
but it's always a little
bit nerve-wracking

235
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,498
to try something new when
you're having people over.

236
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:13,163
- Bring it on.

237
00:09:13,163 --> 00:09:14,956
- I think Jeremy's a little bit skeptical.

238
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:15,808
- I feel like we need to put it

239
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:17,256
on a cookie sheet or something,

240
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,702
so that if the juices come out

241
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:20,221
it doesn't get all over the oven.

242
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:22,919
- [Kendra] So this is the
very technical technique

243
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,768
of sticking the ham,

244
00:09:24,768 --> 00:09:26,068
I think you have to take the plastic off.

245
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:27,634
- I will, I'm just gonna do it in here.

246
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:30,217
Now I'm going to de-plastic it,

247
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:34,921
and get juice all over my feet.

248
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:38,077
- So this is the very first year

249
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,052
that I've successfully
done Easter outfits.

250
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:41,502
Like the girls are all matching,

251
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:43,257
the boys are all coordinated,

252
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,874
like this is really exciting for me

253
00:09:44,874 --> 00:09:46,291
so I'm gonna attempt a picture.

254
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,643
Oh my goodness, you
guys this looks so cute!

255
00:09:48,643 --> 00:09:49,476
Okay, ready?

256
00:09:49,476 --> 00:09:50,809
One, two, three!

257
00:09:52,134 --> 00:09:53,428
(gasps)

258
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:54,746
- [Jeremy] She's like what the heck?

259
00:09:54,746 --> 00:09:56,041
(laughs)

260
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:56,874
- Now what do we do?

261
00:09:56,874 --> 00:09:58,014
I want a picture of all of us.

262
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,628
- [Elise] Maybe we should
- [Kendra] Try a selfie?

263
00:09:59,628 --> 00:10:00,695
- [Elise] invite the neighbors over?

264
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:01,810
- [Kendra] Invite the
neighbors over? (laughs)

265
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,177
- [Jeremy And Elise] Hey
could you take a picture?

266
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:04,677
- [Jeremy] Naynay!

267
00:10:04,677 --> 00:10:06,238
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness, Nay!

268
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:07,995
- [Jeremy] Jenay, Jenay!

269
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:10,278
Time for a girl picture.
- Can you scoot over?

270
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:12,944
Ready, set, cheese!
- Cheese!

271
00:10:12,944 --> 00:10:14,011
(laughs)

272
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:16,001
- One, two, three!

273
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:17,501
- Cheese!
- Cheese.

274
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:20,472
- [Jeremy] So we feel like
nature's April Fool's joke

275
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:22,139
to us today is snow.

276
00:10:23,298 --> 00:10:24,827
It's snowing.

277
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:25,848
- [Kendra] Caleb's finishing up his

278
00:10:25,848 --> 00:10:28,037
second creation of the day.

279
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:31,870
- I finished my car and
now I'm gonna test it.

280
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,794
(laughs)

281
00:10:34,794 --> 00:10:36,332
- Now it's time for an Easter basket.

282
00:10:36,332 --> 00:10:37,545
This is the second year that we've done

283
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:39,883
a family Easter basket,
and I'm excited about it.

284
00:10:39,883 --> 00:10:41,282
It's fun to just do a simple thing

285
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:46,282
that we can celebrate and
enjoy together as a family.

286
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:48,422
(laughs)

287
00:10:53,372 --> 00:10:54,789
(squeaks)
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

288
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:57,231
She found the binkies!

289
00:10:57,231 --> 00:10:59,252
(screams)

290
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,929
- Starburst!
- Starburst!

291
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,887
- [Jeremy] The first thing they notice.

292
00:11:02,887 --> 00:11:04,925
- What are these again?

293
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:08,047
- So these are two games,
Qwirkle and Hoot Owl Hoot.

294
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,923
- Boom Chicka Dop?

295
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,304
- This is popcorn.

296
00:11:11,304 --> 00:11:13,203
- Cool, but I don't know what it's like.

297
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:14,306
- [Jeremy] We should play it as a family.

298
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,169
- Yep, and eat some
jellybeans and popcorn.

299
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,688
(cheers)

300
00:11:18,688 --> 00:11:21,039
So Jeremy was right, I was wrong.

301
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,257
I'm totally okay with
that, Jeremy's a genius.

302
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:24,911
I didn't think it was
gonna make any juice,

303
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:27,425
I didn't we needed the cookie sheet.

304
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:28,928
He's a smart man.

305
00:11:28,928 --> 00:11:30,338
Okie-dokie.

306
00:11:30,338 --> 00:11:32,838
- For this guy,
- Put that one,

307
00:11:34,697 --> 00:11:36,301
- I'm gonna put down blue.

308
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:37,968
- No, keep that one.

309
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,717
(sings)

310
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:43,505
(laughs)

311
00:11:43,505 --> 00:11:44,361
- So I had to dig through a box

312
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,809
to get my snow stuff
that I had packed away.

313
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,204
I want to make a clear
path through the snow

314
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:52,871
for our family that's coming
over for dinner for Easter.

315
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,678
So I don't know if it's the snow,

316
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:59,203
but we've seen a bunch of deer
in our backyard, and a fox.

317
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:01,296
And obviously there's a lot of birds.

318
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:04,609
It's always fun when
there's wildlife around.

319
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,231
(upbeat music)

320
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:09,116
- I'm grateful for Michael and Elise.

321
00:12:09,116 --> 00:12:13,643
- [Jeremy] (laughs) And Isaac, Caleb?

322
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:17,307
- I'm grateful for Laura
and Elizabeth and Jenaynay

323
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,368
and Elise and Isaac.

324
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,480
- [Jeremy] You made it! (laughs)

325
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,830
- [Child] Good night, Jay house out.

326
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:28,830
- This one's going to
be perfect! (evil laugh)

327
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,604
(upbeat music)

328
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,348
- [Jeremy] How'd it turn out?

329
00:12:36,348 --> 00:00:00,000
- Really good.
