1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:01,855
- I'm going on a date with Daddy.

2
00:00:01,855 --> 00:00:03,129
- [Kendra] Okay are you guys
headed out on a bike ride?

3
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:04,349
- Yep.
- Yep.

4
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:05,614
(bright music)

5
00:00:05,614 --> 00:00:06,447
(sneezes)

6
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:07,655
- [Kendra] Oh bless you.

7
00:00:07,655 --> 00:00:09,155
- [Caleb] Finally.

8
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:25,050
(sweet music)

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,252
- [Jeremy] Hey.

10
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:27,085
(laughing)

11
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,835
- She is crawling so

12
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,625
(Janae squeals)

13
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,411
- [Jeremy] Hey.

14
00:00:49,894 --> 00:00:51,973
- So here in Kansas City,
we are in that gorgeous

15
00:00:51,973 --> 00:00:54,309
time of year when it's nice and cool

16
00:00:54,309 --> 00:00:56,365
in the morning, and
then it's nice and warm

17
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,324
in the afternoon.

18
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:59,757
And that's fantastic,
I absolutely love fall.

19
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:02,031
The only problem is I
never know what to wear,

20
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,621
because I get up in the
morning and I'm cold,

21
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,637
so I want to put on like
nice snuggly warm clothes,

22
00:01:05,637 --> 00:01:07,629
but then by the afternoon, I'm roasting

23
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,079
and I want to be in shorts and a t-shirt.

24
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,439
Lise what are you doing tonight?

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,687
- I'm going to my first ballet.

26
00:01:13,687 --> 00:01:14,520
- [Kendra] A real ballet?

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,353
- Uh-huh.

28
00:01:15,353 --> 00:01:16,186
- [Kendra] Who's taking you?

29
00:01:16,186 --> 00:01:17,107
- Dad.

30
00:01:17,107 --> 00:01:18,590
- Dad, so you're going on a date with Dad?

31
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:19,511
- Uh-huh.

32
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:20,744
- [Kendra] And what are
we working on right now?

33
00:01:20,744 --> 00:01:21,803
- Choosing what to do.

34
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:22,980
- [Kendra] There this dress

35
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,813
- With this.

36
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:24,944
- [Kendra] with that headband.

37
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:26,520
- Or this dress.

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,713
Or this skirt with this.

39
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,347
This with this.

40
00:01:30,347 --> 00:01:32,257
- [Kendra] Yep and then
this is your little jacket

41
00:01:32,257 --> 00:01:33,352
that you can wear with any of them,

42
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:35,212
since it'll be cooler out.

43
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:36,045
- [Elise] Yep.

44
00:01:36,045 --> 00:01:37,085
- [Kendra] Alright, so
you've narrowed it down

45
00:01:37,085 --> 00:01:39,085
to the top four options.

46
00:01:40,026 --> 00:01:41,001
Do you know which one you want to do?

47
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:42,628
- Yep, this one.

48
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:43,461
- [Kendra] This one?

49
00:01:43,461 --> 00:01:44,910
It's a beautiful dress.

50
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,029
Whatcha playin'?

51
00:01:46,029 --> 00:01:49,218
- So this is the kid and this is the mom

52
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:52,550
and this is the dad, which is silly.

53
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,671
- [Kendra] Is the dad silly?

54
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,069
- Yeah.

55
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,168
These two are the characters
who goes to this family.

56
00:01:59,168 --> 00:02:00,591
- [Kendra] Oh very cool.

57
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,366
So what's gonna happen in the story?

58
00:02:02,366 --> 00:02:04,451
- I'm gonna pretend that she's bad.

59
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:06,127
- [Kendra] Uh-oh the
ballerina's the bad guy?

60
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:06,960
- Mmm-hmm.

61
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,459
- [Kendra] And the characters
are gonna protect the family

62
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:09,979
from the bad guy?

63
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:10,812
- Yeah.

64
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:12,389
- [Kendra] Do yo have
a little bit of a cold?

65
00:02:12,389 --> 00:02:14,842
Your nose sounds a little bit stuffy.

66
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,219
- That's because I blowed my nose.

67
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,556
- [Kendra] Did you blow your nose?

68
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:21,102
- Yeah, that's why I have a cold.

69
00:02:21,102 --> 00:02:22,322
- [Kendra] Well I'm sorry you have a cold.

70
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,524
I hope you feel better.

71
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:24,388
- Thanks.

72
00:02:24,388 --> 00:02:25,817
I want to change her outfit.

73
00:02:25,817 --> 00:02:27,162
- [Kendra] This looks
like a football game.

74
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:28,844
- I'm defeating him.

75
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,403
- What?
- No, not anymore.

76
00:02:30,403 --> 00:02:32,670
- So some days I have
great self-discipline

77
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,438
with my eating and some days,

78
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,679
not so much.

79
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:36,934
We're not gonna talk about how many

80
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:37,876
Oreos I've had today.

81
00:02:37,876 --> 00:02:38,923
Just not gonna talk about it.

82
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:41,506
(bright music)

83
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,692
That's a cute outfit for Elsa.

84
00:02:44,692 --> 00:02:46,700
You're gonna change the bad guy's outfit?

85
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,533
- Yeah.

86
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:51,366
- [Kendra] Oh no, are
you gonna make it scary?

87
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:00,401
Boy that is a scary looking bad guy.

88
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,068
This is one of our favorite games.

89
00:03:02,068 --> 00:03:03,710
There's a bunch of different kinds,

90
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,707
the game is called Timeline

91
00:03:04,707 --> 00:03:07,156
and this is the American history version.

92
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:08,771
We also have the world history one

93
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,458
and the inventions one.

94
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:11,610
We like Timeline, don't we?

95
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,443
- Yeah.

96
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:13,355
- [Kendra] Every round of the Timeline's

97
00:03:13,355 --> 00:03:14,690
a little bit different.

98
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,523
Who won?

99
00:03:15,523 --> 00:03:17,274
- You won by one card.

100
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:19,312
- [Kendra] Barely, usually
you beat me at this game,

101
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:22,229
so that's quite the triumph for me.

102
00:03:38,237 --> 00:03:39,070
Oh no.

103
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,870
(enchanting music)

104
00:03:55,497 --> 00:03:57,003
The end, is that your story?

105
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:58,251
- Yeah.

106
00:03:58,251 --> 00:03:59,084
- That was a fun story.

107
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:00,426
Isaac has a friend over

108
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,124
and we are having Chick-fil-A.

109
00:04:03,124 --> 00:04:05,204
I love Chick-fil-A's sauce, ya'll.

110
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:06,454
- That is good.

111
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:09,099
- [Kendra] How's Chick-fil-A?

112
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:10,170
- Good.

113
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,432
- [Kendra] Doing a little dance,

114
00:04:11,432 --> 00:04:12,822
a little Chick-fil-A dance?

115
00:04:12,822 --> 00:04:14,390
Laura, what have we been doing?

116
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,356
- Puzzles.

117
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,439
- [Kendra] Puzzles, just you and me, huh.

118
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,024
How many puzzles did we do?

119
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,611
- One two three four five.

120
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:22,479
- [Kendra] Five.

121
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,312
- Yeah.

122
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:24,384
- [Kendra] Which one's your favorite?

123
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:25,217
- This one.

124
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:27,848
- [Kendra] Yeah, what's that one gonna be?

125
00:04:27,848 --> 00:04:29,374
- Firetruck.

126
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:30,650
- [Kendra] (whispers) Firetruck.

127
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:32,282
- Here's the fire!

128
00:04:32,282 --> 00:04:34,235
- You found the fire for the firetruck.

129
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,658
So we're just hanging out on the floor.

130
00:04:35,658 --> 00:04:39,179
(violin playing)

131
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,846
(piano playing)

132
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:48,593
(bluesy music)

133
00:05:03,235 --> 00:05:04,283
- Walmart didn't have any of the shoes

134
00:05:04,283 --> 00:05:06,114
we were looking for for Caleb,

135
00:05:06,114 --> 00:05:08,676
so we're trying Target.

136
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,734
(groovy upbeat music)

137
00:05:10,734 --> 00:05:13,131
So we're looking for shoes like this

138
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:14,464
in Caleb's size.

139
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:18,261
We're trying another place.

140
00:05:18,261 --> 00:05:19,972
- [Caleb] Finally.

141
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:21,640
- So this store only had one pair

142
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,873
that is in his size range, too,

143
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:25,956
so we'll see if it works.

144
00:05:28,516 --> 00:05:29,349
Those work?

145
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:30,407
- Mmm-mmm.

146
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,157
- Okay let's get 'em.

147
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:36,600
Mission accomplished.

148
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,600
You got 'em.

149
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:41,544
Your Harry Potter outfit is complete.

150
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:45,856
(sneezes)

151
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:47,551
- [Kendra] Oh bless you.

152
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:48,384
Hi.

153
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,605
(Janae shrieks)

154
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,541
(Kendra laughs)

155
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,708
- Then you go.

156
00:06:00,718 --> 00:06:05,197
- [Kendra] So Caleb is
starting to learn to type.

157
00:06:05,197 --> 00:06:06,685
How's it going so far dude?

158
00:06:06,685 --> 00:06:09,613
- Good, I want to learn
how to do the games.

159
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,731
- [Kendra] You want to learn the games?

160
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:12,641
So he's got his position.

161
00:06:12,641 --> 00:06:14,188
Is this kind of like playing the piano?

162
00:06:14,188 --> 00:06:15,021
- Yes.

163
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:22,013
(lively playful music)

164
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:22,865
- He's pumping up the new tires.

165
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:24,544
So Jeremy and I got a new bike.

166
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:25,377
We're rally excited about it.

167
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,020
The kids have been riding
around the cul-de-sac

168
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,266
a bunch, and we want to be able

169
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:29,195
to take them on longer bike rides,

170
00:06:29,195 --> 00:06:30,955
but neither Jeremy or I had a bike,

171
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,642
so we got one that we can share

172
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,562
and Jeremy's pumping up the tires

173
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:35,946
and getting it ready.

174
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:37,732
- Yeah, I just love our tree.

175
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:38,565
- [Kendra] I know.

176
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,031
- [Jeremy] It makes me so happy.

177
00:06:40,031 --> 00:06:41,855
- [Kendra] I'm so glad it
didn't break in the storm.

178
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:44,387
- It was just a little
twig when we moved in,

179
00:06:44,387 --> 00:06:48,090
and as it grows, it's like this memorial

180
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:50,058
of the growth of our family
while we've been here.

181
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:51,450
- [Kendra] Isaac, how are you feeling?

182
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,283
- I'm excited.

183
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,271
- [Kendra] Usually you just
ride around the cul-de-sac,

184
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:54,920
this is gonna be different.

185
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,753
- Yeah.

186
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:56,586
- [Kendra] There's gonna be hills.

187
00:06:56,586 --> 00:06:57,419
- Yeah.

188
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,252
- [Kendra] Okay, let's
be safe, let's do it.

189
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,296
- [Jeremy] You look hot as a bicycler.

190
00:07:00,296 --> 00:07:01,590
- Oh yeah I do.

191
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,900
- [Jeremy] Of course, we gotta
get you some of them Spandex.

192
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,380
- We're off.

193
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,874
- [Jeremy] Alright, have fun.

194
00:07:07,874 --> 00:07:09,276
(stopwatch ticking)

195
00:07:09,276 --> 00:07:11,065
- Oh my goodness.

196
00:07:11,065 --> 00:07:11,898
- I'm tired.

197
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:12,731
- [Kendra] How was it?

198
00:07:12,731 --> 00:07:14,049
- Tiring.

199
00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:15,344
- But what'd you think?

200
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:16,616
- I really liked it a lot,

201
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,920
especially when we went up the big hill,

202
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,632
because we started with
the really big hill,

203
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:23,856
down, so then it went down really fast

204
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,231
and went up.

205
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,064
- It was awesome.

206
00:07:26,064 --> 00:07:27,636
Okay, so here's the embarrassing part,

207
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:30,780
unfortunately as we were
riding on the last hill home,

208
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,603
I was like man, I'm so tired,

209
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:35,654
I'm so sore, I forgot how
exhausting it is to ride a bike,

210
00:07:35,654 --> 00:07:38,278
and that's when I realized
I did the gears wrong

211
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:39,111
the entire time,

212
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,087
like I did it the exact opposite.

213
00:07:41,087 --> 00:07:42,502
And I've done that before.

214
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,597
When I did the triathlon
years and years ago,

215
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:46,789
I did the entire bike portion

216
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:48,453
in the complete reverse of the gears,

217
00:07:48,453 --> 00:07:49,361
like when I should've gone into high gear,

218
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,961
I went in the low gear.

219
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,932
I don't know why bikes and gears

220
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:55,084
are so hard for me with that.

221
00:07:55,084 --> 00:07:57,155
It's like my brain can't figure it out.

222
00:07:57,155 --> 00:07:58,891
So I'm excited for Jeremy
to get to take Elise

223
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,670
on a bike ride and that way
he can feel this worn out too.

224
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,793
Hydrate hydrate hydrate.

225
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:05,165
You want to hear something funny?

226
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:05,998
- Yeah.

227
00:08:05,998 --> 00:08:07,274
- I did the gears

228
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:08,107
- Did you forget?
- backwards.

229
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:08,940
- Again?

230
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,773
- [Kendra] Again.

231
00:08:09,773 --> 00:08:10,606
- Did you tell them about this?

232
00:08:10,606 --> 00:08:11,439
- [Kendra] Yes and I didn't figure it out

233
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,010
until we were on the hill coming home.

234
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,355
I am so sore.

235
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:16,013
- You just have to do it a lot more then

236
00:08:16,013 --> 00:08:17,794
to figure out the gears.

237
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:21,377
- [Kendra] My legs,
these legs are so sore.

238
00:08:23,284 --> 00:08:24,117
You need to go on a bike ride

239
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:25,786
and you need to do the
gears in the opposite

240
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:26,619
then they should be,

241
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,202
that way you'll get a really good workout.

242
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:29,035
- Okay.

243
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,024
- Some are pink and some are green.

244
00:08:30,024 --> 00:08:33,864
Some are the ugliest you'll ever see.

245
00:08:33,864 --> 00:08:36,607
Some might be stripey or polka dotty,

246
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,803
but we can all pajammy
in whatever we gotty,

247
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:40,787
it's pajama time.

248
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:41,620
Oh yeah.

249
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,215
Jammy to the left, jammy to the right,

250
00:08:44,215 --> 00:08:45,965
jammy jammy jammy pj.

251
00:08:46,892 --> 00:08:48,142
- [Kendra] Hey are you guys
headed out on a bike ride?

252
00:08:48,142 --> 00:08:48,975
- Yep.
- Yep.

253
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:49,808
- [Kendra] Good luck.

254
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:50,641
- Thanks.

255
00:08:50,641 --> 00:08:51,474
- [Kendra] Keep them all alive.

256
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:52,411
- We will.

257
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,377
You want to come with us?

258
00:08:53,377 --> 00:08:55,960
(lively music)

259
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:08,670
- Hi Dada.

260
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,503
- [Kendra] Hi big girl.

261
00:09:09,503 --> 00:09:11,075
You wanna go on a ride?

262
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:11,983
- Sure.

263
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:14,783
- I'm gonna take these
little girls on a walk.

264
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:15,616
Come on.

265
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:21,087
- [Kendra] Hey Laura, how was your walk?

266
00:09:21,087 --> 00:09:22,264
- Good.

267
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:23,097
- [Jeremy] We're having fun.

268
00:09:23,097 --> 00:09:24,531
- [Kendra] Are you glad
you're wearing your helmet?

269
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:26,364
- Yeah, to protect me.

270
00:09:31,692 --> 00:09:32,948
- [Kendra] I've been curling her hair,

271
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,329
we're getting all ready.

272
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:37,170
- And I put, what's it called again,

273
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,728
deodorant and perfume on.

274
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:40,669
- [Kendra] Ooh aren't you grown up.

275
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:42,795
- [Jeremy] You look
beautiful, I love your dress.

276
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:44,108
- Thanks.

277
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:46,097
- We're gettin' her all dolled up.

278
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:47,904
- She's gonna put on perfume.

279
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,259
- [Jeremy] Perfume.

280
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:52,592
(lively big band music)

281
00:10:00,192 --> 00:10:01,359
- That's good.

282
00:10:02,283 --> 00:10:04,450
Wow, they do it different.

283
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:20,894
- [Jeremy] Are you so excited?

284
00:10:20,894 --> 00:10:21,727
- Mmm-mmm.

285
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,476
- So Elise is the perfect date.

286
00:10:23,476 --> 00:10:24,524
She's so sweet.

287
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:26,979
I think she's told me
she loves me 15 times

288
00:10:26,979 --> 00:10:30,620
in the last hour and she's
so excited to be here,

289
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,663
so it's really fun to be with her tonight.

290
00:10:32,663 --> 00:10:34,079
What do you think?

291
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,079
- I like it.

292
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,662
It's almost like in Cinderella.

293
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,966
(enchanting atmospheric music)

294
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:44,549
This is tall, wow.

295
00:11:09,105 --> 00:11:10,609
- [Jeremy] Would you like
to be in a ballet someday?

296
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:12,202
- Uh-huh.

297
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:14,285
- [Jeremy] Okay go on in.

298
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:26,612
(laughing)

299
00:11:26,612 --> 00:11:28,362
- Please turn off all

300
00:11:30,238 --> 00:11:32,543
- [Jeremy] Cameras and phones.

301
00:11:32,543 --> 00:11:33,376
- Wuh-oh.

302
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,116
- Once the show starts,

303
00:11:36,116 --> 00:11:37,571
we aren't allowed to film anything,

304
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,335
so I think we're gonna end it right here.

305
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:41,061
- Good night J House out.

306
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:42,781
- She's just fun, hi.

307
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:43,614
(laughs)

308
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,963
Caleb got kneed in almost his eye,

309
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:47,629
it's already swelling up.

310
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:48,803
- [Elise] This is hard.

311
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:51,834
- [Kendra] My body hurts
just watching you guys.

312
00:11:51,834 --> 00:11:54,743
- Pay me, you owe us two dollars.

313
00:11:54,743 --> 00:11:55,915
How's the cookie?

314
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,748
- Good.

315
00:11:56,748 --> 00:00:00,000
(bright music)
