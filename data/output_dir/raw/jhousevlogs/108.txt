1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,357
- [Dad] Super Laura!

2
00:00:01,357 --> 00:00:03,734
Not a poop your pants face.

3
00:00:03,734 --> 00:00:04,567
- No, you give me mad and then

4
00:00:04,567 --> 00:00:06,169
I'll show you my mad face.

5
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:07,376
(dad laughs)

6
00:00:07,376 --> 00:00:09,794
(upbeat Latin music)

7
00:00:09,794 --> 00:00:10,644
- And there's not just one of them,

8
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:11,483
there's more than one.

9
00:00:11,483 --> 00:00:13,070
Is this a thing and I had no idea?

10
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,723
(upbeat Latin music)

11
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:17,375
- [Dad] What did you just do?

12
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:20,502
- I put Honey Nut Cheerios
with my apple sauce.

13
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:21,710
Mmmm.

14
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,544
- [Dad] So, it's okay?

15
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:23,555
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,254
- We're running really low on milk,

17
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:27,720
and so, I got apple
sauce for them to have,

18
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,655
not with Cheerios, but she
wanted to combine it so...

19
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,488
Whatever.

20
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:37,215
- [Mom] Caleb is teaching Laura today,

21
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:38,616
how to help unload the dishwasher.

22
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:39,658
Laura is working hard.

23
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:40,491
- Work!

24
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:43,543
- Good job.

25
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,491
And just make sure you
don't like throw 'em,

26
00:00:45,491 --> 00:00:47,991
make sure it looks more clean.

27
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:52,894
- [Mom] Line them up, so they're nice.

28
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:54,553
- That looks super nice.

29
00:00:54,553 --> 00:00:55,386
- Thanks.

30
00:00:56,338 --> 00:00:58,033
- [Mom] Hey, there you are.

31
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,450
I'm over here, come this way.

32
00:01:02,786 --> 00:01:05,388
She's like, "I don't fit."

33
00:01:05,388 --> 00:01:07,972
Looks like Janae wants to help.

34
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:11,944
- You're so good, Janae.

35
00:01:11,944 --> 00:01:12,958
Laura, you're doing a great job.

36
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:16,873
- I hand it to you and
you put 'em right there.

37
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:19,132
- [Mom] Good teamwork.

38
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:20,871
Nae Nae wants to play.

39
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:22,230
[Babbling]

40
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,174
Hi!

41
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:24,530
I'm folding my friend's
laundry this morning

42
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,538
and it's amazing how much more fun it is

43
00:01:26,538 --> 00:01:28,727
to do jobs for other people

44
00:01:28,727 --> 00:01:29,793
than just for yourself.

45
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:31,551
Folding laundry, our own laundry,

46
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,040
not really my favorite,
but for some reason

47
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,268
doing it for other people
is really more fun.

48
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:36,268
- All right.

49
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,122
Super Laura!

50
00:01:41,122 --> 00:01:42,641
Super Laura!

51
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:45,058
(epic music)

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,667
- I'm Super Monster!

53
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,579
- [Dad] Super Monster?

54
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,893
What does Super Monster do to people?

55
00:01:54,893 --> 00:01:56,613
- They save people.

56
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:57,446
- [Dad] They save people?

57
00:01:57,446 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay, show us how to save Leesie.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,667
- Oh hello, monster.

59
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:03,409
Ahh, thank you.

60
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:04,423
- You're welcome.

61
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,553
- [Dad] Thank you, Super Monster.

62
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,080
- You're welcome!

63
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,377
- [Mom] Unloading the groceries

64
00:02:08,377 --> 00:02:10,706
is pretty much like
Christmas at our house.

65
00:02:10,707 --> 00:02:14,051
You sound so excited; what is it?

66
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:14,968
Watermelon.

67
00:02:16,105 --> 00:02:17,128
(excited squealing)

68
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:17,961
What is it?

69
00:02:17,961 --> 00:02:18,816
- Yay, spaghetti!

70
00:02:18,816 --> 00:02:20,464
- [Mom} Spaghetti, Yes!

71
00:02:20,464 --> 00:02:21,909
- Apples!

72
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:23,915
(gasps)

73
00:02:23,915 --> 00:02:25,343
Cheese!

74
00:02:25,343 --> 00:02:28,171
- [Mom] Thanks for the help, kids!

75
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:29,065
- Boo.

76
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,898
Boo.

77
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,355
Boo.

78
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:33,188
(snorts)

79
00:02:33,188 --> 00:02:34,604
(laughter)

80
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:35,709
Boo.

81
00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:38,376
(both laughing)

82
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,345
(blows a raspberry)

83
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,178
Love you.

84
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:46,339
Nothin'?

85
00:02:47,448 --> 00:02:49,592
Do you see who that is?

86
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:51,074
Look who that is.

87
00:02:51,074 --> 00:02:52,324
Who the booboo?

88
00:02:53,436 --> 00:02:55,269
Who is the pretty one?

89
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:59,221
I realized that I hadn't cuddled

90
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:00,666
with her enough today.

91
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,892
(smooching)

92
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:04,871
♫ Bom diddy bom, bom diddy bom diddy bom

93
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,831
(gasps)

94
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,664
It's Mom!

95
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,037
- Hi.

96
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:12,698
- ♫ Bom diddy bom diddy bom diddy bom

97
00:03:12,698 --> 00:03:14,135
The boys have been making
some noise in here.

98
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,461
I'm gonna see what they're up to.

99
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,574
- Your goal is higher than
here and hit the door.

100
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,370
- [Dad] Okay.

101
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,991
Does Caleb's face ever get kicked in?

102
00:03:22,991 --> 00:03:24,408
- So far not yet.

103
00:03:25,257 --> 00:03:27,090
- [Dad] Oh, he did it!

104
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:29,284
A block!

105
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,170
(urban music)

106
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:35,132
Oh!

107
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,712
That was a little low.

108
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:37,545
- Hike!

109
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:39,334
- [Dad] Oh, he got it!

110
00:03:39,334 --> 00:03:40,333
'Kay guys, it's time for lunch.

111
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,166
Let's go eat.

112
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,570
We're doing leftovers for lunch.

113
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,829
- They're good.

114
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,458
- Mm-hmm.

115
00:03:46,458 --> 00:03:49,347
- [Dad] Thanks for being troopers.

116
00:03:49,347 --> 00:03:52,972
- Laura, can you show me your mad face?

117
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:56,046
- [Dad] Is that your mad face?

118
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,231
- Yeah.

119
00:03:57,231 --> 00:03:58,064
- That's very mad.

120
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:58,897
- I know!

121
00:03:58,897 --> 00:04:02,230
I know, it's really, really, really mad.

122
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,744
- [Dad] You never know when you're

123
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,853
gonna need your mad face.

124
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:07,417
Oh, there's Leesie's mad face!

125
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,046
You guys all look too cute for these

126
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,418
to be mad faces.

127
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,901
(fart noises)

128
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:14,023
Not a poop your pants face.

129
00:04:14,023 --> 00:04:16,106
(laughs)

130
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:19,690
Mad face.

131
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,095
Nothing.

132
00:04:21,095 --> 00:04:22,438
- I don't know if I can do it to a camera.

133
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:23,688
- [Dad] Your mad face?

134
00:04:23,688 --> 00:04:24,521
- Oh yeah.

135
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:26,206
- [Leesie] No, it goes like this.

136
00:04:26,206 --> 00:04:28,162
- [Dad] Oh yes, she kind of like...

137
00:04:28,162 --> 00:04:31,694
It's like she's sucking on something.

138
00:04:31,694 --> 00:04:32,670
Oh, there's the mad face.

139
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,844
- No, that's not my mad face.

140
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:35,677
You get me mad and then I'll show

141
00:04:35,677 --> 00:04:37,034
you my mad face.

142
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:38,010
- [Dad] (laughs)

143
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,699
There's Isaac's mad face.

144
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:40,697
- [Mom] It looks like a
little bit of a smirk.

145
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,173
It's hard to do it without
a little bit of a smirk.

146
00:04:42,173 --> 00:04:43,123
- [Dad] Do not laugh.

147
00:04:43,123 --> 00:04:43,956
(laughs)

148
00:04:43,956 --> 00:04:44,789
(Dad laughs)

149
00:04:44,789 --> 00:04:45,622
Okay, here we go.

150
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,020
It is hard when you're trying to do it.

151
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,088
Okay, on three: One, two, three.

152
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:50,921
- [Child] You're allowed to scream.

153
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:53,682
(fart noises)

154
00:04:53,682 --> 00:04:55,057
- I'm a rock.

155
00:04:55,057 --> 00:04:57,285
(laughing) I'm not
entertained by gas sounds.

156
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,084
That would never make me smile.

157
00:04:59,084 --> 00:05:00,027
- (blows a raspberry)

158
00:05:00,027 --> 00:05:00,994
- [Mom] So I keep finding the kids

159
00:05:00,994 --> 00:05:03,379
laying in the warm sunshine spots.

160
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,155
- It's funny how outside it's freezing

161
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:08,098
and in here when you're in the sun

162
00:05:08,098 --> 00:05:09,181
it's so good.

163
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:11,874
- [Mom] It is.

164
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,369
Teaching Laura how to fold?

165
00:05:14,369 --> 00:05:15,202
- Uh-huh.

166
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:18,861
And then you go across,
and then you put it away.

167
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,185
- [Mom] We're so proud of Jeremy.

168
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:22,185
- I was bored and tried.

169
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:25,136
I was like, "I wonder if I could do it."

170
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:28,099
We have had a lot of people
ask about J House shirts,

171
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:30,878
and we're working on that.

172
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,524
- If you think it would be
fun to get J House shirts,

173
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:33,649
give a thumbs-up to this video

174
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,117
and we'll keep working on it.

175
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:37,950
(Classical music)

176
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:44,670
- [Mom] Caleb wins!

177
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:46,170
- [Dad] Go get it!

178
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:55,417
Why is that so cute?

179
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:59,584
(child singing "A Whole New
World" from Disney's Aladdin)

180
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:09,363
- All right, we got the
laundry all loaded up.

181
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:10,196
And now I'm going to go deliver this

182
00:06:10,196 --> 00:06:13,169
to my friend and I'm hoping
to take her a little treat.

183
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:15,669
(urban music)

184
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:21,609
- [Dad] Nice!

185
00:06:28,933 --> 00:06:30,303
Woo!

186
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,301
- I decided to pick up a smoothie

187
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:34,092
because that just sounds
yummy and delicious.

188
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,142
It's like a treat, but you still feel

189
00:06:35,142 --> 00:06:36,493
healthy after you eat it.

190
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,128
I'm gonna grab one of those now.

191
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:38,977
And I'm getting one for myself,

192
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:43,060
because as long as I'm
here might as well, right?

193
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:54,402
- Hey big girl, it's time to get up

194
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:55,985
from our nap, okay?

195
00:06:56,914 --> 00:06:59,028
I'm time to get up, big girl.

196
00:06:59,028 --> 00:07:00,212
If Laura's nap goes too long,

197
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:03,136
she's practically
impossible to get to sleep

198
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:04,674
around bedtime.

199
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,984
So we're trying to get her to get up.

200
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:07,401
It's not working.

201
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:10,428
- I made it to Bed Bath and Beyond

202
00:07:10,428 --> 00:07:11,620
and I'm immediately remembering

203
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,467
why we don't have curtains, even after

204
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:14,786
we've lived in our house for four years.

205
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:16,475
It's because it's such a hard decision!

206
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:18,620
I would rather have
curtains than no curtains.

207
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,594
I think we're gonna do
a double curtain rod

208
00:07:20,594 --> 00:07:24,109
and we're deciding between this one

209
00:07:24,109 --> 00:07:25,102
and this one.

210
00:07:25,102 --> 00:07:27,003
We wanna put white, sheer
curtains on the back rod

211
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:28,421
so that we can pull those shut

212
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:30,269
and it won't be such harsh light,

213
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:32,226
but we'll still have
some light in the room.

214
00:07:32,226 --> 00:07:34,977
And then we also want to
have hanging curtains,

215
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,335
but I can't decide on those.

216
00:07:36,335 --> 00:07:37,944
I'm walking around checking
out all these curtains

217
00:07:37,944 --> 00:07:39,447
and I think I'm gonna FaceTime Jeremy

218
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:40,738
to get his opinion, but what I really wish

219
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:43,732
I could do is FaceTime all
of you at the same time

220
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:46,039
because I have no idea what I'm doing.

221
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,039
(peppy swing music)

222
00:07:50,283 --> 00:07:52,092
Jeremy and I prefer blues and greens,

223
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:53,002
so I'm just looking at everything

224
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:55,399
that's blue or green.

225
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,711
I don't like the way that
these kinds of curtains

226
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:58,227
attach to the rod.

227
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,857
I prefer the way these attach.

228
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:01,923
I don't know what that's called,

229
00:08:01,923 --> 00:08:04,673
but I like how they slide easier.

230
00:08:11,881 --> 00:08:12,715
- Hi, Mom.

231
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:13,928
- [Mom] Hi, guys.

232
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:14,850
I'm just shoppin'.

233
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,900
- [Dad] We're just missin' ya.

234
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,814
I want Mom.

235
00:08:18,814 --> 00:08:20,345
- No, she's just getting sad.

236
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:21,379
I didn't love any of those options

237
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:22,212
so I think I'm gonna hit another store

238
00:08:22,212 --> 00:08:24,395
but I want to show you guys
something that I found here.

239
00:08:24,395 --> 00:08:28,200
So apparently these are
called mermaid pillows.

240
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,533
I think they're really cool.

241
00:08:32,395 --> 00:08:34,426
They're mesmerizing!

242
00:08:34,426 --> 00:08:36,572
I think my kids might like these.

243
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:41,003
These might need to go
on their Christmas lists.

244
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,086
Look at that.

245
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:48,451
So as I'm out and about shopping

246
00:08:48,451 --> 00:08:49,284
I'm definitely starting to think

247
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:50,650
about Christmas list items for my kids

248
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,955
and I'd love to hear what's
on your Christmas list.

249
00:08:53,955 --> 00:08:56,788
(Christmas music)

250
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,225
So this store is covered
in Christmas stuff.

251
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,983
This is the most unique thing I've found.

252
00:09:04,983 --> 00:09:08,136
It's like a mannequin
dress Christmas tree.

253
00:09:08,136 --> 00:09:08,969
What?

254
00:09:10,002 --> 00:09:10,835
And there's not just one of them,

255
00:09:10,835 --> 00:09:11,749
there's more than one.

256
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,215
Is this a thing and I had no idea?

257
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,132
Check it out, here's the other one.

258
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,208
I was talking to my sister Tiffany

259
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,183
and she says we really need an area rug.

260
00:09:21,183 --> 00:09:23,198
That would pull in the color
of the curtains together,

261
00:09:23,198 --> 00:09:25,886
and I trust her because
she was a beautiful house.

262
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:27,592
I don't know if I can
make that many decisions.

263
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:30,532
I like this white one cuz it's super soft.

264
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:34,199
This one's too fancy
for me but it's pretty.

265
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:37,985
Well, I didn't have much
success out shopping.

266
00:09:37,985 --> 00:09:39,734
But I have a better idea
of what I'm looking for

267
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:41,834
so I'm gonna keep shopping for
those things another night.

268
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:45,171
And for now I got to come
home and hang with her.

269
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:46,588
Did you have fun?

270
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:49,858
Can you say "Ahhhh?"

271
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,508
- Ahhhh.

272
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:56,575
- Say goodnight, J House out.

273
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,382
♫ It's time to say hello.

274
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:01,965
(all laughing)

275
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:06,329
And Laura sits down next to me and picks

276
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,829
up a giant booger.

277
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,979
(baby squeals)

278
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:10,946
Yeah!

279
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:12,452
That's my desire, just to raise kids

280
00:10:12,452 --> 00:00:00,000
that know their mother loves them.
