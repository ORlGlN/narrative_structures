1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,609
- [Kendra] When you eat this cake tomorrow

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:03,030
you're gonna be eight years old.

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,947
- Welcome to our hotel.

4
00:00:06,056 --> 00:00:08,855
- [Papa] It's so good to see ya.

5
00:00:08,855 --> 00:00:11,605
(cheerful music)

6
00:00:12,936 --> 00:00:14,390
- And a seagull flew by and took

7
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:17,640
the whole granola bar out of her hands.

8
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:20,337
- Good morning.

9
00:00:20,337 --> 00:00:22,693
We woke up today to the best text ever.

10
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,970
Granny Jo and Papa Keith
have landed at the airport,

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,215
and they are on our way
to come to our house.

12
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:28,452
We were a little bit surprised,

13
00:00:28,452 --> 00:00:29,980
because we thought they
were coming in later today,

14
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,344
so I come out to the kitchen and I said,

15
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:33,221
"Red alert! They're gonna be here soon!"

16
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:35,271
And the kids jumped
up, squealing with joy,

17
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:37,071
and we all hurried and cleaned the house

18
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,362
probably the fastest that I've ever seen

19
00:00:38,362 --> 00:00:40,017
the house get cleaned,
so that's a good thing.

20
00:00:40,017 --> 00:00:41,778
It's amazing what motivated kids can do

21
00:00:41,778 --> 00:00:43,153
to clean up a house.

22
00:00:43,153 --> 00:00:46,103
- So this is what I made. (chuckles)

23
00:00:46,103 --> 00:00:47,618
Isn't it beautiful?

24
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:49,064
- [Kendra] You made it for Granny Jo?

25
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:49,897
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:50,910
- [Kendra] It is very beautiful.

27
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,738
- And I need these seashells.

28
00:00:52,738 --> 00:00:54,456
- [Kendra] You're kinda just designing it?

29
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:55,289
- Yeah.

30
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,503
- So everything looks super nice.

31
00:00:56,503 --> 00:01:00,534
I like how you used seashells
and plants and my car keys.

32
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:01,759
Can I actually take those car keys?

33
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,640
- No.

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,126
- I had to rescue the car keys,
but the rest of the design

35
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:06,404
I'm letting her work with.

36
00:01:06,404 --> 00:01:08,306
So why are making this pretty design?

37
00:01:08,306 --> 00:01:09,139
- For fun.

38
00:01:09,139 --> 00:01:10,307
- [Kendra] For fun.

39
00:01:10,307 --> 00:01:11,845
Well it looks really nice.

40
00:01:11,845 --> 00:01:13,499
I like your dress you chose today.

41
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:14,453
- Oh, thank you.

42
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:16,804
- Welcome to our hotel.

43
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,395
- [Kendra] So this is the room where

44
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,267
Granny Jo and Papa Keith are gonna stay.

45
00:01:20,267 --> 00:01:23,124
- And then this is some stuff.

46
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,299
- [Kendra] Tell us about it.

47
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,049
- [Elise] So this says,
"Welcome to J Hotel."

48
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:30,968
- [Kendra] So we got some Peanut M&M's

49
00:01:30,968 --> 00:01:32,849
and all the kids wrote notes.

50
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:35,994
Thank you for coming to our
house, from Caleb, to Granny Jo.

51
00:01:35,994 --> 00:01:38,300
Dear Granny Jo and Papa
Keith, thank you for coming,

52
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,331
I'm excited to have you here.

53
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:42,331
Welcome to J Hotel, love, Isaac.

54
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:43,946
Laura wrote her name.

55
00:01:43,946 --> 00:01:46,234
So Elise, what do you call today?

56
00:01:46,234 --> 00:01:47,304
- Elise Eve!

57
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:48,992
- [Kendra] Why is today Elise Eve?

58
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,614
- 'Cause tomorrow's my birthday.

59
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:53,319
- [Kendra] Tomorrow's her birthday!

60
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,445
How old are you gonna be?

61
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:55,278
- Eight!

62
00:01:55,278 --> 00:01:57,278
- And I'm gonna be four!

63
00:01:58,253 --> 00:01:59,343
- [Kendra] You're gonna be four?

64
00:01:59,343 --> 00:02:00,291
- Mm-hmm!

65
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,348
- [Kendra] When are you gonna be four?

66
00:02:01,348 --> 00:02:02,973
- Four days, I think.

67
00:02:02,973 --> 00:02:04,296
- [Kendra] It's six days.

68
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:05,606
- Oh.
- [Elise] Six days.

69
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:06,885
- [Kendra] You've got six
days 'til your birthday.

70
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:08,445
- That's a lot.

71
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:10,251
- [Elise] They're here!

72
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:11,820
- [Kendra] What do you guys see?

73
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,021
- They're here!

74
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:15,854
(excited chatter)

75
00:02:17,272 --> 00:02:18,716
- It's so good to see ya.

76
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:22,267
- [Kendra] It's Granny Jo and Papa Keith!

77
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,524
- I've grown!

78
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:25,003
- You are.

79
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:26,359
- [Caleb] All by myself!

80
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:28,904
- All by yourself, that
is amazing, look at that.

81
00:02:28,904 --> 00:02:30,713
Oh my goodness.
- [Papa] J Hotel. (laughs)

82
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:32,608
- And we helped, and we helped you share.

83
00:02:32,608 --> 00:02:34,672
- [Kendra] Jeremy emerged.

84
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:35,834
- (chuckles) Hi.

85
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:37,547
- [Jeremy] Thanks for coming.

86
00:02:37,547 --> 00:02:38,793
- So what we're doing is we're assembling

87
00:02:38,793 --> 00:02:41,295
our dinner, we're making shish
kabobs for dinner tonight,

88
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,539
so we're getting it all done this morning

89
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,128
so we can go out and
play, and then get home

90
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:46,388
and just pop them on the
grill and eat dinner.

91
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:48,211
And everybody's helping.

92
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,711
(latin music)

93
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:00,778
What happened?

94
00:03:00,778 --> 00:03:02,500
- I started crying.

95
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,333
- 'Cause you're working with the onions?

96
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,261
It happens.

97
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:07,855
Laura just came running in to me,

98
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:11,579
"Papa Keith's in the tree,
Papa Keith's in the tree!"

99
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:12,412
- [Laura] Come see!

100
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:13,602
- [Kendra] Come see?

101
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:15,616
Papa Keith is in the tree!

102
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:19,082
- Hey, we're just a bunch
of monkeys in the tree.

103
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:21,514
- Elise is wanting to
try to climb the tree.

104
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,847
One, two, three.

105
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:26,787
- [Papa] Oh, hey, way to go, Elise.

106
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:27,790
- [Kendra] You can do it.

107
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,040
- [Child] Yeah!

108
00:03:30,106 --> 00:03:31,425
- [Kendra] There she is.

109
00:03:31,425 --> 00:03:34,627
How much are we gonna
try to put in this tree?

110
00:03:34,627 --> 00:03:36,271
- It's a little bit awkward.

111
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:38,953
Do I jump and try to lift myself up?

112
00:03:38,953 --> 00:03:42,953
- [Kendra] There's nothing,
this can't go wrong.

113
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,014
- (laughs) Do I do the leg lift?

114
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:48,022
Or do I lift myself up, or--

115
00:03:48,022 --> 00:03:50,439
(both laugh)

116
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:54,603
- [Kendra] Jeremy has a lot of strengths,

117
00:03:54,603 --> 00:03:57,993
but he's not super flexible,
he's not super flexible.

118
00:03:57,993 --> 00:03:59,493
There he goes, oh!

119
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,773
Oh. (laughs)

120
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:06,343
- I'm laughing too hard.

121
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,397
It's too funny. (laughs)

122
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,825
All right, there we go.

123
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:12,606
I am a tree climber.

124
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:14,087
- [Kendra] How many
people are we gonna fit

125
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,300
in this tree up here?

126
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,452
- [Granny] Hi, Dada.

127
00:04:16,452 --> 00:04:18,492
- [Kendra] Hi, you want in?

128
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:19,574
- Hey!
- Hi, Da.

129
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,926
- [Kendra] Hi, Dad.

130
00:04:20,926 --> 00:04:23,343
(beat music)

131
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:30,115
So today we're bringing
Granny Jo and Papa Keith

132
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:32,354
out to La Jolla Cove, we
haven't been here before,

133
00:04:32,354 --> 00:04:34,066
and it is already gorgeous.

134
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,523
We hear there's some seals,
so we're hoping to find them.

135
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:39,523
Look at how the water crashes, guys!

136
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,527
Is this gorgeous?

137
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,449
- I could just watch the ocean all day.

138
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:49,026
- I don't see any seals.

139
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:52,398
- [Kendra] We're not
in the right spot yet.

140
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:54,253
Do you see a bunch of seals?

141
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,188
- Yeah.

142
00:04:55,188 --> 00:04:57,984
- Right there, they look like rocks.

143
00:04:57,984 --> 00:05:01,317
(bouncy keyboard music)

144
00:05:06,326 --> 00:05:07,962
- [Jeremy] Do you see the birdies?

145
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:10,214
(Janae vocalizes)

146
00:05:10,214 --> 00:05:12,964
(relaxing music)

147
00:06:06,812 --> 00:06:08,062
Careful, Laura.

148
00:06:16,995 --> 00:06:18,297
(laughs)

149
00:06:18,297 --> 00:06:19,380
I got soaked!

150
00:06:20,749 --> 00:06:24,035
Completely wet. (laughs)

151
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:28,934
The waves all of a sudden came
in and I got completely wet.

152
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:31,510
I hope the camera's okay,
I kind of bashed it.

153
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,150
So I was down pretty close to the water,

154
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,133
but no waves were getting
me, and then out of nowhere,

155
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:41,178
two huge waves combined, and I got soaked.

156
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:42,432
It was really funny.

157
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:45,271
- I saw him, and it was funny. (laughs)

158
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,354
(light guitar music)

159
00:07:01,102 --> 00:07:02,189
- [Kendra] Here I am again!

160
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,546
(squeals)

161
00:07:03,546 --> 00:07:07,713
Jeremy has to just walk. (laughs)

162
00:07:08,615 --> 00:07:10,126
Hi, Nae-Nae.

163
00:07:10,126 --> 00:07:13,043
(Janae verbalizes)

164
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,175
- So we gave all the kids granola bars,

165
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:18,868
and I had Laura up on my
shoulders and she was eating it,

166
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:20,900
and a seagull flew by and took

167
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,453
the whole granola bar out
of her hands and flew away.

168
00:07:24,453 --> 00:07:25,577
- [Kendra] And flew off with it.

169
00:07:25,577 --> 00:07:26,693
- It was insane.

170
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:27,778
- Poor Laura, it was pretty sad.

171
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:29,126
Luckily we have another one.

172
00:07:29,126 --> 00:07:30,906
- That looks like a Dr. Seuss tree.

173
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:33,504
- [Kendra] You're right.

174
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:35,811
- Dr. Seuss lived here in La Jolla,

175
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,741
and he got the inspiration for the trees

176
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:42,522
in The Lorax from these
trees at this park.

177
00:07:42,522 --> 00:07:44,356
- [Kendra] That's really cool.

178
00:07:44,356 --> 00:07:47,247
- [Jeremy] Here, you
just take a little bit.

179
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,508
I will watch for the birds.

180
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:53,284
She's a little traumatized
about granola bars.

181
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:54,534
Here they come.

182
00:07:55,765 --> 00:07:57,013
Eat it quick.

183
00:07:57,013 --> 00:07:58,406
(Kendra laughs)

184
00:07:58,406 --> 00:07:59,793
- [Granny] We'll stand around you.

185
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:02,112
- Poor Laura's a little bit
nervous about the seagulls,

186
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:06,078
but she wants to eat a granola
bar, so Dad's protecting her.

187
00:08:06,078 --> 00:08:07,131
- Don't mess.

188
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:08,363
- [Child] Shoo!

189
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,406
- [Granny] Just keep eatin'.
- They're like flying around,

190
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,406
they're all circling in.

191
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:20,095
- Oh, 'cause there's one right there!

192
00:08:24,198 --> 00:08:26,781
(seal barking)

193
00:08:28,102 --> 00:08:29,236
All right, what's your guess?

194
00:08:29,236 --> 00:08:32,029
How much does an adult harbor seal weigh?

195
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:34,467
- He says maybe 400, for an adult.

196
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,986
- [Jeremy] 400, you thought 100.

197
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,546
- I said about 110.

198
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:40,125
- I thought, like, 55.

199
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:42,597
Isaac thought 25.
- [Isaac] No, no--

200
00:08:42,597 --> 00:08:43,883
- Caleb, what do you think?

201
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:45,212
- 25.

202
00:08:45,212 --> 00:08:46,228
- 25 pounds?

203
00:08:46,228 --> 00:08:48,852
- I thought that they weighed 250.

204
00:08:48,852 --> 00:08:50,935
- I think about like 560?

205
00:08:54,222 --> 00:08:55,950
- It's hard, 'cause there's baby ones,

206
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,107
and then adult ones.

207
00:08:57,107 --> 00:08:59,187
- Well, I think it depends
for a male versus a female,

208
00:08:59,187 --> 00:09:01,083
but my guess is 150 pounds.

209
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,471
- [Jeremy] What's the answer?

210
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:05,054
- Males weigh up to 375 pounds,

211
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,347
and females weigh up to 330 pounds.

212
00:09:09,347 --> 00:09:11,930
(groove music)

213
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:23,508
- So we were hoping to find
a playground on the beach,

214
00:09:23,508 --> 00:09:26,770
but I think this is cooler
than a normal playground.

215
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,603
The trees.

216
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:33,566
Do you feel the mist on your hair?

217
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:35,604
- So it's starting to
mist, and Laura asked me,

218
00:09:35,604 --> 00:09:37,631
"Mom, what kind of a storm is this?"

219
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,292
It's just the fog coming in, I think.

220
00:09:39,292 --> 00:09:41,256
There's a cave down there!

221
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:42,914
I wanna go, but we're done and we're tired

222
00:09:42,914 --> 00:09:44,005
and we're ready to go.

223
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:45,027
Another time.

224
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:46,413
So we're headed home, and it turns out

225
00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,172
this wasn't just the fog coming in.

226
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,711
It's definitely raining, so we walked back

227
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:51,308
to our car in the rain.

228
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,205
But the good news is, as we were driving,

229
00:09:53,205 --> 00:09:54,925
we drove past a
Lamborghini, so we actually

230
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,437
circled back around 'cause
the kids wanted to see it.

231
00:09:57,437 --> 00:09:59,061
So here's the question,
how much do you think

232
00:09:59,061 --> 00:10:00,770
a Lamborghini costs?

233
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,413
- I thought $300,000.

234
00:10:02,413 --> 00:10:03,499
- [Kendra] $300,000.

235
00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:04,332
- 441.

236
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,719
- [Kendra] 441 from Laura.

237
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:09,325
Caleb, what do you think?

238
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,644
- $20.

239
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:11,758
- [Kendra] $20.

240
00:10:11,758 --> 00:10:13,675
- I would say $700,000.

241
00:10:15,196 --> 00:10:17,917
- [Kendra] All right, Leesie?

242
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,000
- Um, $1,000.

243
00:10:20,158 --> 00:10:21,160
- [Kendra] $1,000.

244
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,170
I can't guess 'cause I
looked up the correct answer.

245
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,696
The starting price for
Lamborghinis is $200,000.

246
00:10:27,696 --> 00:10:30,248
- So tomorrow is Elise's birthday,

247
00:10:30,248 --> 00:10:32,146
and the kids are starting
to wrap their presents

248
00:10:32,146 --> 00:10:33,345
that they got for her.

249
00:10:33,345 --> 00:10:35,923
All right, the boys combined
to get a present for her.

250
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:38,423
Go ahead and cut it up, Isaac.

251
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,343
She's gonna love this.

252
00:10:49,891 --> 00:10:50,974
- [Kendra] So what are we making?

253
00:10:50,974 --> 00:10:52,103
- My breakfast cake.

254
00:10:52,103 --> 00:10:53,388
I always--
- [Kendra] For what?

255
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:54,486
- My birthday.

256
00:10:54,486 --> 00:10:56,839
I always have it every single time,

257
00:10:56,839 --> 00:10:58,822
on my birthday.

258
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,185
- [Kendra] And Granny Jo's gonna help her.

259
00:11:00,185 --> 00:11:01,933
You guys are gonna work
together and make it, right?

260
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:04,180
- And how many of the teaspoons
are we supposed to have?

261
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,351
- Four?

262
00:11:05,351 --> 00:11:06,338
- Four, mm-hmm.

263
00:11:06,338 --> 00:11:07,373
- Four.

264
00:11:07,373 --> 00:11:09,135
- Four, okay, excellent, so we've got

265
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:10,511
our baking powder in now.

266
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:11,631
- [Kendra] Hey, Laura, you know what the

267
00:11:11,631 --> 00:11:13,798
number four reminds me of?

268
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:16,992
- My birthday!

269
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:20,507
(piano music)

270
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:33,296
- Now take your thumbs and
pull the shell apart, yeah.

271
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:34,765
You know what, I think you did--

272
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,432
- [Kendra] Good job!

273
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:41,446
Nice.

274
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:43,204
Are you guys playing with some Legos?

275
00:11:43,204 --> 00:11:44,037
- [Both] Yeah.

276
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:46,177
- It's like our, it's like us.

277
00:11:46,177 --> 00:11:47,010
- [Kendra] It's our Lego picture?

278
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:47,843
- Yeah.

279
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:49,038
- [Kendra] Nice.

280
00:11:49,038 --> 00:11:50,679
- Dad and Papa look so
much alike, kind of.

281
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:52,047
- [Kendra] You're right.

282
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:54,675
- [Granny] One, two, three.

283
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:57,008
- [Both] Seven, eight, nine.

284
00:11:58,215 --> 00:12:01,715
- [Kendra] Caleb, that is looking awesome.

285
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:11,892
- Sugar.

286
00:12:11,892 --> 00:12:14,074
- Yep, this is the best
part, this is the topping.

287
00:12:14,074 --> 00:12:16,432
Janae wants some and I
won't give it to her.

288
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:19,156
I'm a mean, mean mom. (Janae screeches)

289
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,573
There we go, mmm.

290
00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:25,062
So Leesie, when you
eat this cake tomorrow,

291
00:12:25,062 --> 00:12:26,866
you're gonna be eight years old.

292
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:27,699
- I know.

293
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:34,525
- These shish kabobs smell amazing.

294
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:39,092
(bright music)

295
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:50,086
What's our new read-aloud?

296
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,532
- All-of-a-Kind Family by Sydney Taylor.

297
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:55,384
I think we should end the day
with a good night J House out

298
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:59,099
from a seven year-old who
will never be seven again!

299
00:12:59,099 --> 00:13:01,039
- Good night, J House out.

300
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,085
- [Jeremy] Do do do doo!

301
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,014
- Nailed it.

302
00:13:03,014 --> 00:13:04,268
- [Kendra] Laura, how does the seashell

303
00:13:04,268 --> 00:13:05,550
let us hear the ocean?

304
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,013
- I don't know!

305
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,596
(bouncy music)

306
00:13:10,435 --> 00:13:13,021
- (gasps) She just did it again!

307
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,027
It's so cute, and I'm losing my mind.

308
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,485
I'm making some last-minute purchases

309
00:13:16,485 --> 00:00:00,000
to get ready for Elise's birthday.
