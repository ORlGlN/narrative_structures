1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,720
- Backwards day and forwards day.

2
00:00:05,048 --> 00:00:07,695
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:07,695 --> 00:00:09,778
(cheers)

4
00:00:12,075 --> 00:00:13,827
- Hidden drawer up here.

5
00:00:13,827 --> 00:00:15,359
- [Jeremy] You wouldn't
even know it was there.

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,942
(upbeat music)

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,773
(guitar music)

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,300
- I'm getting ready.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,030
- My job is to protect everyone.

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,000
- Laura is becoming the
queen of this kingdom.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,280
- We're gonna have Elise go first.

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,245
(orchestral music)

13
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:47,930
Now we're gonna have Laura.

14
00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:51,736
(orchestral music)

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,130
- Now we are going to have
Prince Charming dance.

16
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:03,012
(techno music)

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,299
- That kind of reminded me of River Dance.

18
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:14,388
(Irish music)

19
00:01:14,388 --> 00:01:16,501
- Now the ball may begin.

20
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,084
(upbeat music)

21
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,700
- We're going to the ball.

22
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,910
- So I was just sitting
over here on the couch

23
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:34,900
and I was like, man I'm thirsty.

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,370
I didn't even realize
that I said that out loud.

25
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,340
A few minutes later, Laura
shows up with this cup

26
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,230
and it's got ice and water in it.

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,160
She's like, here you go.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,990
I'm like, what in the world.

29
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:48,480
It was just honestly a
really tender surprise to me.

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,810
I get my kids water all the time.

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,330
I'm always taking care of their needs.

32
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:54,540
So for her to without even being asked

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,250
bring me a glass of water, I
was like oh you're so sweet.

34
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,083
It was just really tender

35
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:01,050
and oh Nae-nae has
something to say about that.

36
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,950
- I am getting ready for
crazy hair day for basketball.

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,630
- [Jeremy] So all of the
players are doing crazy hair?

38
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,530
- My coach is even doing it.

39
00:02:14,876 --> 00:02:15,709
I'm done.

40
00:02:18,428 --> 00:02:20,845
- Backwards and forwards day.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,700
- [Kendra] Is today backwards
day and forwards day?

42
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,730
What's the backwards part?

43
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,530
Show me the other side of her shirt.

44
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,330
And what's forwards day?

45
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,570
Nice, great outfit.

46
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,726
So are you gonna do your
hair forward or backward?

47
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:39,309
(upbeat music)

48
00:02:44,574 --> 00:02:45,407
(laughter)

49
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:48,310
So Janae has not been herself
at all today or last night.

50
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,560
She's extra cranky.

51
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,330
She's still distr actable,
but mostly she won't nurse.

52
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:55,530
When a baby that breastfeeds really well

53
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,770
all of a sudden stops, it's
called a nursing strike

54
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,650
and it usually means they're teething,

55
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,280
maybe their ears are bothering them

56
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,700
and it usually just resolves on its own.

57
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,460
I've been pumping and reading
about what I'm supposed to do.

58
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,320
It's kind of sad 'cause she's more cranky

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,710
and I'm like come on, just nurse.

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,920
You playing with Miss Laura?

61
00:03:19,003 --> 00:03:19,836
- I'm painting.

62
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:22,530
I need the color...
what color did she use?

63
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,513
Pink.

64
00:03:24,513 --> 00:03:26,120
Alison let's me borrow hers.

65
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,900
You ready for a nap little stink?

66
00:03:29,754 --> 00:03:31,101
Hi Dad.

67
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,492
♪ Let's get ready to rumble ♪

68
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,721
- [Announcer] Alright
moms and dads, let's _

69
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:37,371
the court to the away team the _.

70
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,544
(cheers)

71
00:03:41,944 --> 00:03:44,470
(techno music)

72
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,400
- So before the game, Isaac made a chart

73
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,870
that he wanted me to keep stats

74
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,550
for how he does in the game.

75
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,620
How many points he
makes, how many rebounds.

76
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,924
I'll be trying to fill
that out through the game.

77
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:57,507
(techno music)

78
00:04:00,126 --> 00:04:02,889
(cheers)

79
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:05,472
(techno music)

80
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:07,974
(cheers)

81
00:04:07,974 --> 00:04:10,557
(techno music)

82
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,770
Alright, Isaac is one
rebound away from his goal

83
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,130
of a double double.

84
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,990
There's two and a half minutes left.

85
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,649
(cheers)

86
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:24,700
(techno music)

87
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,740
Good job buddy.

88
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,020
You did awesome, you got your goal.

89
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:32,480
- [Coach] So Isaac,
you played great today.

90
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,200
You shot the ball well,
you dribbled the ball well.

91
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,780
We don't count baskets,
I don't know how many

92
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,319
baskets your scored.

93
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,525
You probably counted didn't you?

94
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,358
That's okay, that's alright.

95
00:04:43,358 --> 00:04:47,000
After a little while,
what did I ask you to do?

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,150
- Start passing.

97
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,530
- [Coach] Almost every single time

98
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,210
you made a pass what happened?

99
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:53,018
- We ended up scoring.

100
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:54,391
- [Coach] We ended up scoring.

101
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,850
Your teammate got a cool shot.

102
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:00,490
- Well I'm really proud of Isaac.

103
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,240
In the last game, it had
been 13 or 14 minutes

104
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,290
into the game before he shot a ball.

105
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,910
He didn't have any rebounds at that point

106
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,251
and he just wasn't playing aggressive.

107
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,084
So we worked on that, we talked about it.

108
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,223
He set goals and he had
22 points this game,

109
00:05:12,223 --> 00:05:16,130
19 rebounds and he had a lot of passes

110
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,700
and a lot of assists and steals.

111
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,880
I was just really proud of him.

112
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,460
The only goals he didn't meet I think

113
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,220
were things outside of his control.

114
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,910
They asked him to not
steal the ball anymore.

115
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:26,850
- I couldn't find two
of any of my flip flops

116
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,450
but I found one of each and
they're on the right feet.

117
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,410
So I figure I'm pretty good to go.

118
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,725
It's warm enough out for flip flops.

119
00:05:33,725 --> 00:05:36,308
(guitar music)

120
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,660
So this morning while
Jeremy was with the kids,

121
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,766
I went to a women's
conference at my church.

122
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:54,190
I absolutely loved it.

123
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,190
I went to different workshops
on different topics.

124
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,470
There was one on improving
your personal prayer,

125
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:01,900
one on different ways to get
more from your scripture study,

126
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,570
one on strengthening my
relationship with my savor,

127
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,000
and one that was on
finding the joy in life.

128
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,680
I just come home feeling so inspired

129
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,810
and just rejuvenated.

130
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,408
I just absolutely love it.

131
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:14,290
It does help that there's
also lunch at the end

132
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,230
and I got to sit and
visit with my friends.

133
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,610
I feel like I've had
just a lovely morning.

134
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,040
I'm excited to try to
apply a lot of the things

135
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,920
that I learned about and
talk to Jeremy about.

136
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,070
Just some little changes
that we can make in our home

137
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,570
and in our family and in my life

138
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,090
so that I can feel closer to my savior.

139
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,143
Smells good.

140
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,570
- So we're wanting to put
something in our basement

141
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,220
that the kids can do down and read on.

142
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,820
We thought maybe a big bean bag,

143
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,574
but a couch would be really nice too.

144
00:06:41,574 --> 00:06:44,157
(upbeat music)

145
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,430
It's so hard right now because
we're looking at houses

146
00:06:49,353 --> 00:06:51,650
and considering the possibility of moving.

147
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,150
So it's hard to be upgrading
and doing other things

148
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,520
to our house that we're currently in

149
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,580
if we're gonna be leaving.

150
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,340
If we buy furniture for the
house we're in right now,

151
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,330
but then we move-

152
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,370
We're kind of in a limbo state right now.

153
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,950
- So this dresser has a
little hidden drawer up here.

154
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,590
- [Jeremy] You wouldn't
even know it was there.

155
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:08,740
- I'm super excited about that.

156
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,230
I could put all my special things in here.

157
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,780
- [Jeremy] We no longer need a safe.

158
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,500
We'll put all of our money up here

159
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,090
so if we get robbed,
no one would ever know.

160
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,660
- This drawer right here that pulls out.

161
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,700
You just open this drawer,
you lift up this latch here,

162
00:07:24,926 --> 00:07:25,759
and tada!

163
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,573
- [Kendra] Then it goes back.

164
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:28,850
- [Jeremy] To the hidden part.

165
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:31,440
- Then you close it and
then it stops right there.

166
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,310
- I had no idea dressers
could be like hiding spots.

167
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,740
- [Jeremy] Then if you push this knob,

168
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,230
it opens up to the bat cave.

169
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,430
We were looking at dressers

170
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:42,430
'cause we've been married 13 years,

171
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,390
we still don't have a
dresser and nightstands.

172
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,885
- You have to really get far in life

173
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,718
before you can have those things.

174
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:51,670
Look at these paintings.

175
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:53,420
I actually really like them.

176
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,230
So the kids are with a babysitter tonight

177
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,700
and I'm really excited about it.

178
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,790
She speaks Spanish so
she's gonna be speaking

179
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,990
Spanish with our kids.

180
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,570
I'm interested to see how that goes.

181
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,830
She also speaks English, don't
worry, they're gonna be fine.

182
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,640
Apparently Jeremy's a little bit tired.

183
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,050
- This couch is very comfortable.

184
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,690
- [Kendra] It's super comfy,
it's like a marshmallow.

185
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,497
- We would like to pause the blog for

186
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:15,500
an official moment of silence.

187
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,640
This restaurant that gives
free nacho cheese is closed.

188
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,540
- This is probably Jeremy's favorite.

189
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,290
Is this one of your favorites?

190
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:25,110
- Free nacho cheese.

191
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,384
They just come out with nacho cheese.

192
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,720
- They also give sopapias
when you're done eating.

193
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,950
So this is a Mexican restaurant

194
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,730
and we just decided for
our date night tonight

195
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,049
let's go there and it is closed.

196
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,469
It closed while we were in San Diego.

197
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm really said for Jeremy.

198
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,202
- They must have given
away too many free things

199
00:08:40,202 --> 00:08:42,309
to stay open as a business.

200
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,684
- [Kendra] Why don't you go read

201
00:08:43,684 --> 00:08:44,518
the sign to see what it says.

202
00:08:44,518 --> 00:08:45,751
- Maybe they just moved
to a different location.

203
00:08:45,751 --> 00:08:47,098
- [Kendra] Maybe.

204
00:08:47,098 --> 00:08:49,040
(disappointed music)

205
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
Well I honestly feel
pretty sad for Jeremy.

206
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,260
It is sad when a place
that you really love closes

207
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,530
and it is, it's just closed.

208
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,180
- So where should we go now?

209
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,480
- We came to Chilis.

210
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:01,830
(guitar music)

211
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,210
So we still ordered some caso for Jeremy.

212
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,392
This has avocados and spinach and pico

213
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,390
and all sorts of goodness in it.

214
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:11,757
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

215
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:12,590
- [Kendra] So good.

216
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,300
- [Jeremy] I love how it's sizzling still.

217
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,560
- Here's our problem, our food just came,

218
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,567
but we're already full.

219
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,100
We filled up on chips and salsa
so lunch tomorrow I guess.

220
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,442
- But there is nothing
better than Sunday at lunch

221
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:28,775
eating all of this tomorrow.

222
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:30,970
I'm excited.

223
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,270
- Well we just got the dreaded
call that Janae is fussy

224
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,660
so we are hurrying home.

225
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,190
We took the rest of our food to go

226
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,790
and we'll eat it later.

227
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,990
Time to get to baby.

228
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,010
- [Child] Goodnight, J House out.

229
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,330
- I got kids.

230
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,490
- [Jeremy] How many kids do you have?

231
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,323
- 16

232
00:09:47,177 --> 00:09:49,760
(upbeat music)

233
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,978
- So I got a text that
I'm really excited about.

234
00:09:55,978 --> 00:09:58,787
Here it is, do you know who that is?

235
00:09:58,787 --> 00:00:00,000
(upbeat music)
