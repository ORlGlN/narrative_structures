1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,148
- I turned the car off
without putting it in park.

2
00:00:03,148 --> 00:00:05,616
The car started to roll
and I was out of the car.

3
00:00:05,616 --> 00:00:08,283
(festive music)

4
00:00:11,096 --> 00:00:12,601
- This girl just wrote her name

5
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:14,385
for the first time ever.

6
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:17,281
I go and I put the tape
in the refrigerator.

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:21,007
I'm losing my mind just a little bit.

8
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:23,426
Well poor Caleb and
Laura still have fevers.

9
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:24,935
They are low grade fevers

10
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,527
and today they were acting just fine,

11
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,663
but now this evening, I can
definitely see it in them more.

12
00:00:28,663 --> 00:00:30,993
Laura's been wanting to be held a lot

13
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:32,582
so I've been cuddling her
for a lot of the afternoon,

14
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:34,080
and I can just see it in their eyes,

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,403
they're just not feeling good,

16
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:38,236
so I've put on a show
and they are relaxing.

17
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:40,705
(enchanting music)

18
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:41,914
Hopefully they get better soon,

19
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:43,110
because we were sick last Christmas

20
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,862
and we have a lot of
plans we're still wanting

21
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:45,941
to get done before Christmas.

22
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:48,389
And hopefully, you and Isaac and Elise

23
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,315
and Mom and Dad stay healthy.

24
00:00:50,315 --> 00:00:53,482
(gentle guitar music)

25
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:01,235
- Well I'm loving the sound
of all the birds out here

26
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,635
and watching the squirrels run by.

27
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:06,015
Unfortunately we had a ton of plans today,

28
00:01:06,015 --> 00:01:08,247
of fun stuff and Caleb and Laura

29
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:11,344
both have a fever, so
we're adjusting our plans.

30
00:01:11,344 --> 00:01:13,103
Some things we still have to do,

31
00:01:13,103 --> 00:01:14,754
we'll just have to do them without them.

32
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:17,921
(gentle guitar music)

33
00:01:27,725 --> 00:01:28,972
How are you feelin' this morning bud?

34
00:01:28,972 --> 00:01:29,924
- Sick.

35
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,656
- [Jeremy] I'm sorry buddy.

36
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:33,585
I sure love you.

37
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:35,002
- I love you too.

38
00:01:38,376 --> 00:01:39,459
- [Jeremy] Yeah like Laura actually

39
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:41,667
got unmatching socks past Mom.

40
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:44,266
- Since I don't have
the match to this one,

41
00:01:44,266 --> 00:01:45,386
I lost it.

42
00:01:45,386 --> 00:01:46,271
- [Jeremy] Oh so you're just gonna wear

43
00:01:46,271 --> 00:01:47,335
unmatching ones today?

44
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:48,168
- Yeah.

45
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,349
- [Jeremy] Yeah Laura,
she woke up acting normal,

46
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,697
but her temperature's
up above 100 degrees.

47
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,370
- So I have a fever.

48
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:55,604
- [Jeremy] She has a fever.

49
00:01:55,604 --> 00:01:58,988
(violin playing)

50
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:01,571
(bright music)

51
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,347
♪ A B C D E F G ♪

52
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:12,199
♪ H I J K L M N O P ♪

53
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,259
- [Laura] Don't end, we
have a few more left.

54
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,092
- Oh R.

55
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,759
♪ A B C D E F G ♪

56
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:22,805

57
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:26,533
♪ Now I know my ABC's ♪

58
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:27,366
- [Jeremy] You guys are good,

59
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:28,199
even though you're feeling sick,

60
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,199
you're working together.

61
00:02:32,626 --> 00:02:35,676
- Destroy destroy destroy destroy.

62
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:36,509
(laughing)

63
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:38,117
- The best part of puzzles.

64
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:39,317
So we wanted to make sure our kids knew

65
00:02:39,317 --> 00:02:40,530
how to read these kinds of clocks,

66
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,290
so we got one for each of their rooms

67
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,682
and Cubby and some of the kids

68
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,498
are gonna help me put it up.

69
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,508
Okay bud, grab the stud finder.

70
00:02:47,508 --> 00:02:49,440
Mom wants it on this wall right here.

71
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,030
So see if there's any studs over here.

72
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:54,182
(buzzing)

73
00:02:54,182 --> 00:02:55,015
Right there?

74
00:02:55,015 --> 00:02:56,493
- Uh-huh.

75
00:02:56,493 --> 00:02:59,826
- [Jeremy] So we know
there is a board right here

76
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:00,659
on the wall.

77
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:01,644
We can put a nail there.

78
00:03:01,644 --> 00:03:06,378
So yeah, we can put a nail
there and it will be sturdy.

79
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,306
So Isaac marked the wall.

80
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:09,139
Nail it in Cub.

81
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:10,179
(hammering)

82
00:03:10,179 --> 00:03:12,494
Alright oh that's good, perfect.

83
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:13,705
Alright, now hang it up.

84
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:15,372
- Right there?
- Yep.

85
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,864
- [Jeremy] Good job.

86
00:03:19,864 --> 00:03:20,970
Alright, how does that look?

87
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:23,222
Alright, now in your room.

88
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:24,614
(buzzing)

89
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:26,153
- Right here?
- There we go.

90
00:03:26,153 --> 00:03:28,486
(hammering)

91
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,071
- I like that when we're in our desk,

92
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:33,648
we can just say like what time is it,

93
00:03:33,648 --> 00:03:35,885
and then just look backwards and

94
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:36,821
there it is.

95
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:38,621
- Benjamin Rabbit found it then,

96
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:40,704
just outside the fox's den.

97
00:03:40,704 --> 00:03:42,989
Look he cried, see the tree I found.

98
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,325
With that, he called his family 'round.

99
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,838
The kids are working on an art project.

100
00:03:46,838 --> 00:03:48,245
We are using oil pastels

101
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:49,541
on black construction paper.

102
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:51,715
And they're doing Christmas
trees and Christmas lights

103
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:54,537
and I just love how vibrant
the oil pastels show up

104
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:55,896
on the black construction paper.

105
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:57,704
So Caleb's using a little stencil.

106
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,971
So Caleb you just do
around the outside of it,

107
00:03:59,971 --> 00:04:02,089
so you can kind of see it glow.

108
00:04:02,089 --> 00:04:04,038
Hey Laura, what are you coloring?

109
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:05,781
- You'll see when I'm done.

110
00:04:05,781 --> 00:04:06,614
- [Kendra] Okay.

111
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:07,802
Isaac, what are you working on?

112
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:10,322
- I'm making a Christmas tree.

113
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:11,570
- [Kendra] Lise, what are you working on?

114
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:14,487
- Um lights, I'm gonna have it like

115
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:16,966
kind of in a circle basically.

116
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,799
- [Kendra] Nice.

117
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,119
- I haven't really decided yet.

118
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,410
- Yeah, they're called oil pastels.

119
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,899
They're kind of like crayons,

120
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,841
but they feel so smooth, huh?

121
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:26,247
- Yeah.

122
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,024
- [Kendra] Almost like markers or paint.

123
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,274
So smooth, huh?

124
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,657
Here's Isaac's Christmas tree.

125
00:04:33,657 --> 00:04:35,139
Now you're using a different style

126
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,169
to make a Christmas tree.

127
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,001
Caleb, that looks awesome.

128
00:04:39,001 --> 00:04:39,952
Poor Lise and her glasses,

129
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,065
we've ordered the new ones.

130
00:04:41,065 --> 00:04:43,130
We're just waiting for them to arrive.

131
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,382
So Elise drew a house with
Christmas lights on it.

132
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:47,215
- Uh-huh.

133
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:48,755
- [Kendra] That is so fun.

134
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,206
That's the man on the moon.

135
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,134
I love it.

136
00:04:51,134 --> 00:04:52,822
- [Elise] I made our house with lights.

137
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:55,147
- [Kendra] Here's one I'm working on.

138
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:57,946
The wind is blowing the
tree, very creative.

139
00:04:57,946 --> 00:04:59,957
I think I'm like doing
okay with the holidays

140
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:00,878
and all the business of it,

141
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:04,191
and then I go and put the
tape in the refrigerator.

142
00:05:04,191 --> 00:05:05,496
Losing my mind just a little bit.

143
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:06,518
(playful music)

144
00:05:06,518 --> 00:05:08,647
For lunch today, we're gonna
make Christmas tree rolls,

145
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:12,062
which is just rolls filled
with cheese and turkey,

146
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,284
I think we're gonna put in it

147
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,679
and then baked in the
shape of a Christmas tree.

148
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:16,512
I've been trying hard this year

149
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,283
to find festive holiday foods

150
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,304
that aren't just desserts.

151
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:21,017
That way it can feel more festive,

152
00:05:21,017 --> 00:05:22,763
without us eating desserts constantly.

153
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:23,596
Well I did it,

154
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,706
it successfully looks kind of like

155
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:27,204
the picture that I saw on Pinterest.

156
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:30,531
- Presenting the amazing Christmas tree.

157
00:05:30,531 --> 00:05:31,364
- [Kendra] Oh thanks Cubby.

158
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,667
Alright so these are
cheese and turkey filled

159
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,378
and then I just brushed them with butter

160
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:40,658
and Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese.

161
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:44,241
Okay, let's hope it
comes out looking okay.

162
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:46,276
Well the Christmas tree
took a little bit longer

163
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:48,027
than I expected to make,

164
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:49,536
because I ended up holding Janae

165
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:50,956
most of the time I was doing it

166
00:05:50,956 --> 00:05:53,255
and one-handed, everything
just goes slower.

167
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:55,542
Alright, well the Christmas tree rolls

168
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:57,446
are all ready to go.

169
00:05:57,446 --> 00:06:00,613
(bluesy upbeat music)

170
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:04,285
- Today Isaac and Elise are helping me

171
00:06:04,285 --> 00:06:05,906
with Meals on Wheels.

172
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:09,206
It's where you take food
to people in the community

173
00:06:09,206 --> 00:06:12,003
who are needing support, needing help.

174
00:06:12,003 --> 00:06:15,090
We used to actually do a
route every single week,

175
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:17,969
a couple years ago and
some of those early vlogs

176
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,387
are some of my favorites.

177
00:06:19,387 --> 00:06:22,569
Do you know why we're
bringing food to some people?

178
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:24,798
- Because they don't have enough money

179
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:27,277
to buy some food at stores

180
00:06:27,277 --> 00:06:29,277
and it's a lot of money.

181
00:06:30,846 --> 00:06:31,925
- [Jeremy] Mmm-hmm, so
do we get to help them

182
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,235
by bringing them some food?

183
00:06:33,235 --> 00:06:35,089
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmmm.

184
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,196
- [Jeremy] Do you guys
like taking people food

185
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,196
who need it?

186
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,893
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

187
00:06:38,893 --> 00:06:40,075
- [Jeremy] Okay who wants
to carry the food in?

188
00:06:40,075 --> 00:06:40,908
- Me.
- Me!

189
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:41,946
- [Jeremy] You guys ready?

190
00:06:41,946 --> 00:06:42,905
- No me!

191
00:06:42,905 --> 00:06:43,862
- We're all gonna do it.

192
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,566
Let's all go in and take the food okay?

193
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:48,233
(uptempo music)

194
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:57,647
So I just did a very scary thing.

195
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,302
The car was on and the keys were running

196
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,259
and I was making sure we
found the right place.

197
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,549
And we're on this big hill right here,

198
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:07,015
and I turned the car off

199
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:08,373
without putting it in park

200
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:10,181
and the car started to roll

201
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,087
and I was out of the car.

202
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:15,255
I jumped in, put the brakes on,

203
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:16,382
the adrenaline is pumping,

204
00:07:16,382 --> 00:07:19,171
so that was just a little
bit scary, but we're okay.

205
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:21,754
(bright music)

206
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:24,539
So what did you guys think

207
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:25,372
of doing Meals on Wheels?

208
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:26,512
- I liked it.
- I liked it.

209
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,454
- I liked it too.

210
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,548
- [Jeremy] What did you like about it?

211
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:31,171
- It's just fun to deliver and--

212
00:07:31,171 --> 00:07:32,783
- Thanks for helping me guys.

213
00:07:32,783 --> 00:07:34,494
So this last house we delivered to

214
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,085
is out on a dirt road

215
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:37,861
and it's pretty far out of town.

216
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:39,832
I grew up in the big city but then my mom

217
00:07:39,832 --> 00:07:42,213
married a rancher and
we lived on a dirt road,

218
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,085
so for the poll question today,

219
00:07:44,085 --> 00:07:46,715
do you live off of a dirt road?

220
00:07:46,715 --> 00:07:48,715
Let us know in the poll.

221
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,869
- This girl just wrote her name

222
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:54,582
for the first time ever.

223
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:55,935
What's it say Laura?

224
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,511
- L-A-U-R-A.

225
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,503
- You are a speller.
- Yes.

226
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:01,747
- So she's been writing
L-A L-A on everything

227
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,955
and today we taught here the U and the R,

228
00:08:03,955 --> 00:08:05,807
and then it ends with what?

229
00:08:05,807 --> 00:08:07,192
- R.

230
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:08,234
- Another A.

231
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:09,234
- Another A.

232
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:11,225
- I'm so proud of her, this is so awesome.

233
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:12,892
Can you do it again?

234
00:08:13,821 --> 00:08:15,071
- [Jeremy] L-A-

235
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:17,812
U-R-,

236
00:08:21,047 --> 00:08:22,985
- [Kendra] Yes?

237
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:24,652
- [Jeremy] skinny A.

238
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,999
- Good job.

239
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:27,916
You did it.

240
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,222
- [Jeremy] So proud of you.

241
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,022
- It was so fun watching
her earlier today,

242
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,135
because she was writing
L-A L-A on everything,

243
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:35,166
and then I taught her the U,

244
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,187
and she did it for the first time

245
00:08:36,187 --> 00:08:37,299
and her face just like lit up,

246
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,204
she's like I did it.

247
00:08:39,205 --> 00:08:41,025
So it's been fun to
watch her learning today.

248
00:08:41,025 --> 00:08:42,772
- [Jeremy] Especially when
she's not feeling good.

249
00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:43,606
- Yeah.

250
00:08:44,652 --> 00:08:45,939
I just took her temperature

251
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:47,526
and she still has a fever.

252
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:48,443
It's 100.1.

253
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:53,240
(lively music)

254
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,847
- Every year Aunt Michelle, who does piano

255
00:08:59,847 --> 00:09:02,727
with the kids sets up
a little concert here

256
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:04,535
at the retirement home.

257
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:06,160
It's a great tradition

258
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,993
and Caleb was so bummed,

259
00:09:06,993 --> 00:09:07,959
this was gonna be his first time

260
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:11,850
to get to play the piano in a recital.

261
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:15,167
And he's missing it, he's really sad.

262
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,834

00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:25,510

We hope you guys have a wonderful night.

273
00:10:12,648 --> 00:10:13,481
- Goodnight.

274
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:14,569
J House out.

275
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:16,767
- [Kendra] This was disgusting.

276
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,616
- [Jeremy] Hey Elise, what
happened to your glasses?

277
00:10:18,616 --> 00:10:20,185
- Oh Janae broke them.

278
00:10:20,185 --> 00:10:21,817
(laughing)

279
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:23,152
(Janae yells)

280
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:23,985
- Yeah!

281
00:10:25,524 --> 00:00:00,000
- Oh!
