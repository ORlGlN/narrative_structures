1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,250
- Tommorrow's my birthday.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,648
- [Kendra] It is.

3
00:00:03,648 --> 00:00:08,020
- I got cupcakes, and I
decorated it all by myself!

4
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,330
- [Kendra] Ahh, they are so cute.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,350
- I got one from Brittany.

6
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,183
- [Kendra] Wow!

7
00:00:12,183 --> 00:00:13,016
- [Jeremy] Look at that face.

8
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:13,849
(laughing)

9
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:15,999
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness,
look at this temperature.

10
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:19,907
(light-hearted piano music)

11
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:20,740
(baby squealing)

12
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,130
Well Jenae has a new favorite
spot, now that we're home.

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:26,440
She learned how to climb, huh?

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,179
She knows how to get up there,
but not how to get down.

15
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,140
(baby talking)

16
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,210
Here, Nae Nae, let me show you.

17
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,229
Let me show you.

18
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:37,124
You gotta turn around and climb down.

19
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:39,000
(kids laughing, baby talking)

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,850
She's off, and immediately
trying to get back on again.

21
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,470
So I haven't gotten Janae out of her

22
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:45,670
warm footie pajamas today.

23
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,730
Because she just looks so warm and cozy,

24
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,190
and I don't want to get her cold.

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,100
She just might be in
pajamas for the next month.

26
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,620
As soon as I turn the camera
off, she was up there.

27
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,781
Up and back down.

28
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:57,614
- [Janae] Uh oh.

29
00:00:57,614 --> 00:00:58,447
- [Kendra] Uh oh.

30
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:02,197
(light-hearted, piano music)

31
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:04,550
- [Jeremy] So you guys excited to go back

32
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,050
and see your friends at school?

33
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,903
- [Boys] Yeah.

34
00:01:06,903 --> 00:01:08,827
(melodic music)

35
00:01:08,827 --> 00:01:10,750
- [Jeremy] So how are you
feeling about going to school?

36
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,590
- I'm so excited.

37
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,320
I get to see all of my friends,

38
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,750
which is basically the whole class.

39
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,570
And I'm so excited to
see my teachers again.

40
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,850
But the time change has
a little bit different.

41
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,817
I woke up and was just like...

42
00:01:26,817 --> 00:01:29,610
- [Jeremy] Yeah, it would've
been 5:30 in California.

43
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,120
- Yeah, because I slept in in California.

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,726
- [Jeremy] Nae Nae,
did you find your toys?

45
00:01:35,726 --> 00:01:38,300
Yeah, there it is.

46
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,920
Hey Laura, what are you getting ready for?

47
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,110
- A birthday party.

48
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,725
- [Jeremy] A princess birthday party.

49
00:01:44,725 --> 00:01:45,558
- Mmhmm.

50
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:46,391
- [Jeremy] So fun.

51
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:49,750
- [Kendra] She really wanted
a braided side ponytail.

52
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,207
- [Jeremy] I know it was
harder with shorter hair.

53
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:54,160
- [Kendra] It is, we're doing our best.

54
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,232
- [Jeremy] Let's see it.

55
00:01:55,232 --> 00:01:57,731
(royal music)

56
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,064
You look beautiful and warm.

57
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,590
Very nice.

58
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,150
Last night, when we got
home from the airport,

59
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,210
we unpacked everything,
and so that took some time,

60
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,080
but we did it, and then went to bed.

61
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,760
And we're up super early
because of the time change,

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,860
for the kids to head off to school.

63
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,470
We homeschool our kids,
but one day a week,

64
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,430
they go to a private homeschool co-op.

65
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,263
It's really cool.

66
00:02:20,263 --> 00:02:21,490
Trying to find the bag that will

67
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,770
fit the present for Brittany.

68
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,291
Good job.

69
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,597
- Some tissue paper now.

70
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,103
(paper crumpling)

71
00:02:29,103 --> 00:02:31,686
(baby talking)

72
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:38,217
- [Jeremy] You did a
great job, it's perfect.

73
00:02:38,217 --> 00:02:40,433
- It's a little heavy, but I can carry it.

74
00:02:40,433 --> 00:02:43,500
(playful music)

75
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,019
- [Jeremy] Beautiful!

76
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:47,686
(playful music)

77
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,405
- [Kendra] Bye guys!

78
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,920
- [All] Bye!

79
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,040
- [Kendra] Have a good day!

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,080
You gonna miss them?

81
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,580
- I like them.

82
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,748
- [Kendra] You like them?

83
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:00,581
- [Laura] Mmmhmm.

84
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,414
- Me too.

85
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:02,610
Well, I'm absolutely amazed

86
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,790
that we're on time to school today.

87
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,180
Just because of the time change and

88
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,410
everything that was
going on, but we did it.

89
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,137
Now, it's off to a birthday party.

90
00:03:09,137 --> 00:03:12,387
- (cheering) Uh uh oh!

91
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,561
- [Kendra] Excited to see your friends?

92
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:16,630
- Yeah.

93
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,990
- So a big load of groceries was

94
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,590
dropped off last night at our house,

95
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,020
because I did online grocery
shopping before we arrived.

96
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,660
But of course, I forgot a few things

97
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,040
and Caleb had a few special
requests for his birthday,

98
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,560
which is tomorrow.

99
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,520
So I'm at the store picking up some stuff

100
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,630
and Janae is my buddy.

101
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,465
She and I are having a good time.

102
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:35,130
Boo!

103
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,063
We're just kinda loving
life at the grocery store.

104
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:40,008
Yeah, look at the pretty flowers.

105
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:42,210
Which ones do you like?

106
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,820
They're all so pretty huh?

107
00:03:44,728 --> 00:03:46,990
Pretty flowers.

108
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,010
And I decided that's
what we need this week

109
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,560
to make our adjustment to the cold weather

110
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,680
a little bit sweeter, we're
gonna buy some flowers

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,920
to put on our kitchen table.

112
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,753
How was your party?

113
00:03:56,753 --> 00:03:59,205
- Good, I got cupcackes,

114
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,480
and I decorated all by myself.

115
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,910
- [Kendra] What color did you decorate it?

116
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,030
- Um, white.

117
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,906
- [Kendra] White?

118
00:04:04,906 --> 00:04:05,739
- Uh huh.

119
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:06,572
- [Kendra] Were there any sprinkles?

120
00:04:06,572 --> 00:04:08,496
- Um, yeah, and several of them, too.

121
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:09,610
- [Kendra] Whoa, that's fancy!

122
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,650
Let me see what you got in your hands.

123
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,880
A princess bag, and
what kind of a necklace?

124
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,000
- Candy necklace.

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,833
- [Kendra] A candy--

126
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,666
Are you cold?

127
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:18,499
- Yeah.

128
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:19,332
- [Kendra] Let's get in the car.

129
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,040
Oh my goodness. Look at this temperature.

130
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,200
That's so cold!

131
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,080
Are these the little goodies

132
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,177
you got from your birthday party?

133
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:28,010
- Yeah.

134
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,140
- [Kendra] It looks like it
might be a pencil sharpener.

135
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,478
Yeah, that's cool.

136
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,133
- Two pencil sharpeners.

137
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,000
- [Kendra] Ooh, but they
look like high heels.

138
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,306
That's fancy.

139
00:04:36,306 --> 00:04:38,389
- Oh, I think I wanted...

140
00:04:39,366 --> 00:04:42,275
I got two, one from Brittany.

141
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:44,470
- [Kendra] Wow! This is awesome.

142
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,610
- [Jeremy] How was school?

143
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,674
- [All] Good!

144
00:04:46,674 --> 00:04:47,940
- [Jeremy] Was it good
to see your friends?

145
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,880
- [All] Yeah.

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,930
- So being home is very different
than being in San Diego.

147
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,950
I just met with my accountants.

148
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,300
We're already scheduling appointments

149
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,133
for all kinds of things.

150
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,360
Getting read to drop the kids off

151
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,450
at gymnastics and violin,

152
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,540
and just all the day-to-day normal things

153
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,810
that are here in Kansas City.

154
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,550
But what I want to do is try to

155
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,760
bring the spirit of
adventure with us back home.

156
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,750
There's a lot of things
there that we've wanted to do

157
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,390
or places to go eat that
we haven't tried before,

158
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,210
and so I think as we look
for those things and plan

159
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,050
like we did in San Diego,
we can keep the spirit

160
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,048
of adventure going.

161
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:22,048
(high energy music)

162
00:05:23,404 --> 00:05:25,330
Look at that face.

163
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,230
Look at that face.

164
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,408
Good job.

165
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:34,364
(laughing)

166
00:05:34,364 --> 00:05:35,950
Uh!

167
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,200
Did you miss your basketball hoop?

168
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,259
- Yeah.

169
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,795
(high energy music)

170
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:44,458
(piano music)

171
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:47,780
- So our family has been
really wanting to get a pet.

172
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,050
We would love to have a dog.

173
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,210
But that's a big decision,

174
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,640
and so we have some friends
who are going out of town

175
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,950
and they need a dog sitter.

176
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,020
So I figured that'll be
a great chance for us

177
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,140
to try the responsibility of
having a dog for a short time.

178
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,520
We need to go meet the dog

179
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,140
to make sure it's a good match
before they go out of town.

180
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:03,973
So that's what we're doing right now.

181
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:05,630
We're going to meet Max and Molly.

182
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,917
And he has nothing to say.

183
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:07,956
(barking)

184
00:06:07,956 --> 00:06:09,798
(laughing)

185
00:06:09,798 --> 00:06:12,080
They like the camera.
- [Person] Technology!

186
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,050
- [Kendra] So this is Max and Molly.

187
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,730
Ah, they are so cute.

188
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,250
- [Jeremy] For some reason,
our other kids are feeling

189
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,860
a little nervous about the dogs,

190
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,900
which is why we wanted
to do some dog-sitting.

191
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,903
Janae is the brave one of the children.

192
00:06:23,903 --> 00:06:25,570
- [Kendra] Where did the dogs go?

193
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,820
Hey, you gotta go get them.

194
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,950
- So we're back home.

195
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,880
Poll question: Do you think we should take

196
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,600
Max and Molly for five days?

197
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,433
What do you think?

198
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:38,310
- So I'm really excited about it.

199
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,490
They are very energetic.

200
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,900
I know they would be a
lot of work, but I think

201
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,810
it'll be a good experience for the kids

202
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,760
to be able to kinda get
more used to animals,

203
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,460
and for our family to
see if it's something

204
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,050
we're really interested in
having a pet of our own.

205
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,299
- I wish we had a fence,

206
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,090
'cause it would be a lot easier.

207
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,330
I'm very open to it.

208
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,750
See, it's coming up in a...

209
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,583
Week or two.

210
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,416
- That's very soon.

211
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,249
- We'll have to decide.

212
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:58,082
- We'll have to make a decision.

213
00:06:58,082 --> 00:06:59,000
Laura is asleep,

214
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,960
and I'm getting ready
to put this one to bed.

215
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,490
But the big three kids are all reading,

216
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,110
and it just makes me happy
when the house is quiet,

217
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,310
and they're all reading.

218
00:07:07,303 --> 00:07:08,700
- Tomorrow's my birthday.

219
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,550
- [Kendra] It is.

220
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:12,886
♪ Happy happy birthday. ♪

221
00:07:12,886 --> 00:07:14,912
♪ Happy, happy birthday. ♪

222
00:07:14,912 --> 00:07:17,180
♪ Tomorrow's your birthday, birthday... ♪

223
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,000
- I've got a question for tomorrow.

224
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,955
- [Kendra] What is it?

225
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:24,775
- What will you like the most
out of all of my presents?

226
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,331
- [Kendra] Ooh, that's a good one.

227
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:29,778
(soft piano music)

228
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:31,170
Say "goodnight".

229
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,580
Say "J House out"

230
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,730
(baby babbling)

231
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,563
- Goodnight.

232
00:07:35,563 --> 00:07:36,890
J House Out.

233
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,870
- Well, we are packed up and
getting ready to say goodbye.

234
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,924
- [Jeremy] What was one
of your favorite things

235
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:41,757
that happened here?

236
00:07:41,757 --> 00:07:45,007
(uptempo guitar music)

237
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:48,410
- Haaaah, do you see that?

238
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,740
That's my breath, it's cold.

239
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,250
- [Jeremy] How does it
feel to be home, you guys?

240
00:07:51,250 --> 00:00:00,000
(guitar music)
