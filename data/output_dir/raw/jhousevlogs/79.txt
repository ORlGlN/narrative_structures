1
00:00:00,636 --> 00:00:03,120
- Someone as they were leaving
asked to pay for our check.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,398
Are you gonna buy presents?

3
00:00:04,398 --> 00:00:05,419
- Yeah.

4
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:06,859
- [Jeremy] I think Mom would love a mug.

5
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:08,942
- I just feel like a mom.

6
00:00:10,272 --> 00:00:11,642
- [Jeremy] Looks like a
lot of the toy section

7
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:12,664
got picked over.

8
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:15,311
- You get three since I love you.

9
00:00:15,311 --> 00:00:16,681
- [Kendra] Oh, thanks Laura.

10
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:19,514
(Christmas music)

11
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:23,328
Here we go.

12
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:26,108
There you go.

13
00:00:26,108 --> 00:00:27,153
What are doing today?

14
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:29,197
- Going Christmas shopping.

15
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,237
- [Kendra] Are you gonna buy presents?

16
00:00:30,237 --> 00:00:31,070
- Yeah.

17
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,198
- [Kendra] Who are you shopping for?

18
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,150
- Everyone.

19
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:34,845
- Today the kids are doing
their Christmas shopping

20
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:37,075
for each other and for Jeremy
and I at the Dollar Store.

21
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:38,096
Okay, let's do it.

22
00:00:38,096 --> 00:00:39,118
What you see?

23
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:40,650
She's excited.

24
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:41,835
They're candy.

25
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,335
- Can I have them?

26
00:00:44,226 --> 00:00:45,782
What about one of these?

27
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:48,577
- [Kendra] A military action play set.

28
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:49,506
- Is it pretend?

29
00:00:49,506 --> 00:00:50,690
- [Kendra] Uh huh.

30
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,523
- Can we get this?

31
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:53,424
- [Kendra] Who would it be for?

32
00:00:53,424 --> 00:00:54,794
- Caleb.

33
00:00:54,794 --> 00:00:56,071
- [Kendra] You think
Caleb would like that?

34
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:57,348
What is that?

35
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,370
- Plane.

36
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,833
- [Kendra] Who do you
think would like that?

37
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:00,855
- Daddy.

38
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:01,688
Can I have these?

39
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,521
- [Kendra] What is it?

40
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:03,519
- Hockey.

41
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,003
- [Kendra] You know what,
that's actually called golf.

42
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:07,629
- [Jeremy] Caleb's turn.

43
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:09,835
Alright, who do you wanna
get something for first?

44
00:01:09,835 --> 00:01:10,879
- Isaac.

45
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,629
- [Jeremy] Go get it.

46
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:14,711
- Elise.

47
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:18,635
- [Jeremy] You wanna get Elise a puzzle?

48
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:19,468
- Perfect.

49
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,133
- [Jeremy] I think Mom would love a mug.

50
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,852
- [Kendra] It's Elise's turn.

51
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,935
- I just feel like a mom.

52
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,960
I don't know what to get Dad.

53
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,259
I got him shaving cream

54
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,115
and a football every year.

55
00:01:35,115 --> 00:01:36,369
- [Kendra] So you're having a hard time

56
00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:37,390
thinking of what to get him?

57
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,412
- Yeah.

58
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:41,152
- [Kendra] Time to start
your Christmas shopping.

59
00:01:41,152 --> 00:01:42,499
- Oh, candy.

60
00:01:42,499 --> 00:01:43,799
- [Kendra] Candy is fun.

61
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,864
Let's see if we can walk
around and get any ideas.

62
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:48,234
What are you picking for Laura?

63
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:49,767
- This.

64
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:50,951
- [Kendra] Nail art.

65
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,618
She's gonna love it.

66
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,849
Why yes, yes I can.

67
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:58,288
- [Jeremy] Isaac's turn.

68
00:01:58,288 --> 00:01:59,914
So what do you like about this tradition?

69
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:02,213
- I think it's fun to
get each of the presents

70
00:02:02,213 --> 00:02:03,420
at a Dollar Store.

71
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,860
- [Jeremy] Do you have
any ideas for anyone?

72
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,230
- No.

73
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,507
- [Jeremy] Alright, who
are you getting first?

74
00:02:07,507 --> 00:02:09,225
- I'll go with Laura.

75
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,595
- [Jeremy] Looks like a
lot of the toy section

76
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:14,426
got picked over, makes
it a little bit harder.

77
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:15,866
- This is for Elise.

78
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:17,836
- [Jeremy] She's gonna like that.

79
00:02:17,836 --> 00:02:19,682
- There's a new basketball
sticker collection.

80
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:21,237
- [Jeremy] A new one.

81
00:02:21,237 --> 00:02:24,209
- Yes, are you allowed to
get stuff for yourself?

82
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,183
- [Jeremy] Maybe Nae-nae would like it.

83
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,064
No, you can't get stuff for yourself.

84
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,666
- This ball for Leesy.

85
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,036
- [Kendra] You think
Leesy would like a ball?

86
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,313
You think I would like this one?

87
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:33,335
- Yeah.

88
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:34,891
- [Kendra] Oh, that is beautiful.

89
00:02:34,891 --> 00:02:36,841
- I would like one of these babies.

90
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,211
- [Kendra] You think
Elise would like the baby?

91
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,395
- Yeah.

92
00:02:39,395 --> 00:02:41,021
- [Kendra] I see somebody
who would like a baby.

93
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,157
Who likes the baby?

94
00:02:43,157 --> 00:02:44,434
Who's trying to reach it?

95
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:47,011
She's trying to get it.

96
00:02:47,011 --> 00:02:48,869
- [Laura] I bet Nae-nae would like this.

97
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,402
- [Kendra] Do you like that baby doll?

98
00:02:50,402 --> 00:02:52,120
It's always fun to me to
see what they pick out

99
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,674
and what they think of and
sometimes it's hilarious

100
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,066
and sometimes it's surprising
me how thoughtful it is.

101
00:02:57,066 --> 00:02:58,343
Sometimes it surprises me what

102
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,968
they're noticing about each other.

103
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,801
- For you.

104
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:01,634
- [Kendra] Oh let me see it.

105
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:02,467
Oh, these are nice, who's that one for?

106
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:03,300
- You.

107
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:06,324
- [Kendra] For me?

108
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:07,694
Do you like the headbands?

109
00:03:07,694 --> 00:03:10,295
- Yeah, I like these kinds of headbands.

110
00:03:10,295 --> 00:03:11,270
- [Kendra] For who?

111
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,315
- You.

112
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:13,337
- [Kendra] For me?

113
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:15,473
- You get three since I love you.

114
00:03:15,473 --> 00:03:17,423
- [Kendra] Oh, thanks Laura.

115
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,838
- Are these real flowers.

116
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,462
- [Kendra] Those are
actually called fake flowers.

117
00:03:22,462 --> 00:03:23,739
They're beautiful though huh?

118
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:24,761
Are you done shopping?

119
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,713
- Yep.

120
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:28,523
(upbeat music)

121
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:31,077
- That could be for Laura.

122
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,261
This is Laura's.

123
00:03:32,261 --> 00:03:33,979
- [Jeremy] Some gum?

124
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:34,954
Good choice.

125
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:36,882
- Isaac is gonna love this.

126
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,252
- [Jeremy] Is that for Jenae?

127
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,295
Is that the money you
earned from doing chores?

128
00:03:40,295 --> 00:03:41,545
- Yep, sure is.

129
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,148
- [Jeremy] Who's that one for?

130
00:03:45,148 --> 00:03:46,355
- Elise.

131
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:48,306
- [Jeremy] Elise.

132
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:49,513
- Mom.

133
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:50,506
Janae-nae.

134
00:03:50,506 --> 00:03:52,058
This is for Laura.

135
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:54,287
- [Cashier] It is $6.55.

136
00:03:54,287 --> 00:03:56,331
You have 45 cents and
there's your receipt.

137
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:57,631
Take your change too.

138
00:03:57,631 --> 00:03:58,653
- [Jeremy] Your money.

139
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:01,207
- I'm gonna give Daddy socks.

140
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:02,229
- [Kendra] Nice.

141
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,599
- He's been needing them.

142
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,735
Don't tell Daddy.

143
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:06,826
- You want something?

144
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,707
- [Kendra] You want it?

145
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:09,874
You like that?

146
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:12,980
She likes this section apparently.

147
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,534
- I've always wanted a slinky.

148
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:17,415
- [Kendra] For you?

149
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:21,779
- When I give someone something,
they might give it to me.

150
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,475
- [Kendra] Or you might get to use it.

151
00:04:23,475 --> 00:04:24,497
- Yeah.

152
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,029
This is Caleb's.

153
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:29,280
This is the perfect section
to give something to Isaac.

154
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,613
(jazzy Christmas music)

155
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:37,221
- [Kendra] That's beautiful.

156
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:38,150
- I want this.

157
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,401
- [Kendra] It's always hard
not to just shop for yourself.

158
00:04:41,401 --> 00:04:43,700
It's really easy to get
distracted in a Dollar Store.

159
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,975
There's so many interesting things.

160
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:47,461
- Do you think Isaac will like these?

161
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,628
More athletic.

162
00:04:50,108 --> 00:04:51,200
- [Kendra] Yeah, they look great.

163
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,777
Why don't you try them on?

164
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:54,775
Those will be awesome.

165
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:55,751
So who are those for?

166
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,749
- Isaac.

167
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:58,119
I can't believe all of this is a dollar.

168
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,994
- [Kendra] I know.

169
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:00,994
- Janae-nae.

170
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,102
- Dad.

171
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,167
- [Kendra] Okay, let's shop for Daddy.

172
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,667
- New nail polish.

173
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:12,228
- [Kendra] New nail polish is very pretty.

174
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,621
You can put it in for a choice.

175
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:16,954
- We have to buy one more for Daddy now.

176
00:05:18,514 --> 00:05:20,344
Is this nail polish?

177
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:22,899
- [Kendra] Yeah, it's nail art.

178
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:25,546
- I want one of these nail art.

179
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,821
- [Kendra] Well maybe somebody
else will get one for you.

180
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,422
- I'm gonna one for myself.

181
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,047
- [Kendra] Yeah, but today we are going

182
00:05:32,047 --> 00:05:33,835
Christmas shopping for our family.

183
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:35,716
So you get to buy a present for Leesy.

184
00:05:35,716 --> 00:05:36,993
You could get that for Leesy.

185
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:38,944
- No, what are these?

186
00:05:38,944 --> 00:05:40,476
- [Kendra] Those are fashion nails.

187
00:05:40,476 --> 00:05:42,101
You stick them on your fingers.

188
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:44,238
- I want these for Leesy.

189
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,863
I think Daddy would like this.

190
00:05:45,863 --> 00:05:47,651
- [Kendra] I think he would, go ahead.

191
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:48,673
Put it in there.

192
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:49,880
- That's a lot of stuff.

193
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,831
- [Kendra] We do not have enough money

194
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,108
for all of those things.

195
00:05:53,108 --> 00:05:56,010
You have to choice just one
present for each person okay?

196
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,543
So what do you wanna get for Daddy?

197
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,098
She made some last minute changes

198
00:05:59,098 --> 00:06:00,376
and here's her lineup.

199
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:02,674
I think you picked out
some really good gifts.

200
00:06:02,674 --> 00:06:04,044
Poor Laura's at must the age where

201
00:06:04,044 --> 00:06:06,599
it's actually really hard to understand

202
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,224
that you're not buying
yourself a Christmas present.

203
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,246
She's being a trooper.

204
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:10,871
Money still in your pocket?

205
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,752
Are you ready to pay for it?

206
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,934
Good job Laura, just
put it right up there.

207
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:17,767
(Christmas music)

208
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:21,691
There you go.

209
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,942
(Christmas music)

210
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,405
- That's for our baby.

211
00:06:26,405 --> 00:06:27,496
- [Cashier] Oh, that's so sweet.

212
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:28,959
- [Kendra] Okay, there's your money.

213
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,421
Laura is doing her own
Christmas shopping today.

214
00:06:31,421 --> 00:06:32,588
- Here you go.

215
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:35,693
- [Kendra] There you go.

216
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,202
- I did it.

217
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:38,035
- [Kendra] You got money
back, that's called change.

218
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:39,302
- [Cashier] Here you go, thank you.

219
00:06:39,302 --> 00:06:40,834
- [Kendra] Thank you.

220
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,367
Are you all done with
your Christmas shopping?

221
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,085
Okay, let's go.

222
00:06:44,085 --> 00:06:46,036
- [Jeremy] How did it go Laura?

223
00:06:46,036 --> 00:06:47,286
- Good I got...

224
00:06:48,172 --> 00:06:49,681
- [Jeremy] You got some change?

225
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:51,074
That's exciting.

226
00:06:51,074 --> 00:06:52,444
Hi Dad.

227
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,814
What do you think Laura would like?

228
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,254
- This mirror.

229
00:06:55,254 --> 00:06:56,276
- [Jeremy] A mirror?

230
00:06:56,276 --> 00:06:57,297
I bet she would like that.

231
00:06:57,297 --> 00:07:01,663
You know who else I think
might like that right now?

232
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,102
Nae-nae.

233
00:07:03,102 --> 00:07:05,269
(giggles)

234
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,814
- Okay, I'll get another one too.

235
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:10,440
I'm getting that for her.

236
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,297
- The advantage of having Janae with us,

237
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,407
we can see what she likes.

238
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:15,990
You like the truck?

239
00:07:17,054 --> 00:07:19,387
We should probably buy this.

240
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:24,831
Whoa, check out the sunset.

241
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,756
- [Kendra] Elise is
done with her shopping.

242
00:07:29,756 --> 00:07:32,310
- There's like this one
thing that I really wanted.

243
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,446
I might wanna tell one of my siblings.

244
00:07:34,446 --> 00:07:36,234
- [Kendra] Yeah, was
it hard to not get it?

245
00:07:36,234 --> 00:07:37,232
- Yeah.

246
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:38,370
- [Kendra] That's the hard
thing about Christmas.

247
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,344
- I basically wanted it my whole life.

248
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:41,714
- [Kendra] Is it hard
around Christmas time

249
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:42,736
to be shopping for everybody else?

250
00:07:42,736 --> 00:07:43,757
- Yeah.

251
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,985
Maybe I'll just tell one of
my siblings that I want it.

252
00:07:46,985 --> 00:07:48,703
- [Kendra] Do you know what helps me?

253
00:07:48,703 --> 00:07:51,768
It helps me to remember that on Christmas,

254
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:54,044
I'll receive gifts too.

255
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,692
What really helps me is to think about

256
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,480
how excited people are
gonna be about this.

257
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,841
Think about how Janae's
gonna react to your present.

258
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:03,487
And think about how Laura's
gonna be so excited.

259
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:05,368
- I'm glad that I got tiny objects

260
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,201
so then when it's in
the package it's like...

261
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:10,917
- [Kendra] Yep, nobody will even know.

262
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:12,084
Not the money.

263
00:08:22,016 --> 00:08:25,267
Do you see something fun over there?

264
00:08:25,267 --> 00:08:26,289
- How are you?

265
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:27,311
- Good.

266
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:28,750
- Thank you.

267
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,702
This is your change.

268
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:30,886
- Thank you.

269
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:31,908
- There you go, have a good day.

270
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:33,881
- Merry Christmas.

271
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,528
Can I give some of my cents to the...

272
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:37,551
- [Kendra] Bell ringer?

273
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,688
Sure can, let's do it.

274
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:39,687
- How much?

275
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:43,854
- [Kendra] How ever much
you want, it's your choice.

276
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:50,309
Since the other kids
got presents for Janae,

277
00:08:50,309 --> 00:08:51,934
I'm also going to be helping Janae

278
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:53,467
get a couple gifts for the kids.

279
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:57,043
Is it time to do your Christmas shopping?

280
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:59,365
Which one of these ones?

281
00:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,478
Oh that one looks good?

282
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:03,728
Alright Nae-nae, which one?

283
00:09:05,913 --> 00:09:07,724
You want that one?

284
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:10,371
Oh you want both of them?

285
00:09:10,371 --> 00:09:13,691
You can only have one for Laura.

286
00:09:13,691 --> 00:09:15,479
Tough decisions.

287
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,034
Okay, you licked that one,
we're gonna call that one yours.

288
00:09:18,034 --> 00:09:21,191
Which one for Laura, tough decision huh?

289
00:09:21,191 --> 00:09:22,213
I think that's everything.

290
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:23,839
Now we're gonna go home and wrap.

291
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,256
(rock music)

292
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:33,525
I love this burger.

293
00:09:39,888 --> 00:09:41,650
- [Jeremy] What happened Caleb?

294
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,472
- Somebody paid for us.

295
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:45,330
- [Jeremy] Yeah, just one
of the other people here

296
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,885
anonymously paid for us.

297
00:09:46,885 --> 00:09:48,348
- So our waiter just came up

298
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:49,788
and told us that someone
as they were leaving

299
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,158
asked to pay for our check.

300
00:09:51,158 --> 00:09:53,457
It's just amazing.

301
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,409
He said Merry Christmas.

302
00:09:54,409 --> 00:09:56,870
I just wanna know who it was
so we could go thank them.

303
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,751
- There was this cute old couple over here

304
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:01,073
that was like super nice watching

305
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:02,861
and sympathetic of some of the challenges

306
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:05,322
I was having of watching the kids.

307
00:10:05,322 --> 00:10:06,785
Maybe it was them, I don't know.

308
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,526
But thank you whoever it was.

309
00:10:08,526 --> 00:10:10,105
- So we couldn't tell you
this in the restaurant

310
00:10:10,105 --> 00:10:12,311
but we were so, I don't know, touched

311
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,378
that somebody else paid our bill

312
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:18,140
that we realized wait, we
should pass that along.

313
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:21,205
We looked around and
said, hey we wanna pay

314
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,341
for somebody else's bill.

315
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,640
I don't know, it was just kind of special.

316
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,938
The kids were all excited and
we're like don't look at them.

317
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:30,841
So they weren't supposed to tell them

318
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,884
that the bill was paid
until after we were gone.

319
00:10:32,884 --> 00:10:34,765
So I get they're finding out now.

320
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:36,994
- So with people paying for our meal

321
00:10:36,994 --> 00:10:38,689
during this Christmas
season, it just reminded me

322
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:41,429
of the Light the World
campaign which is all about

323
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:44,842
reminding us to love each
other and to spread goodness.

324
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,120
So if you haven't heard of it,

325
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,652
I'm gonna put a link
in the description box

326
00:10:47,652 --> 00:10:50,299
to the new Light the World video.

327
00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:52,342
One of our kids is in it.

328
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:54,386
So check it out and let
us know in the comments

329
00:10:54,386 --> 00:10:55,719
which kid it is.

330
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,077
(Christmas music)

331
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:12,497
- Goodnight, J House out.

332
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:15,168
- I turned the car off
without putting it in park.

333
00:11:15,168 --> 00:11:17,792
The car started to roll
and I was out of the car.

334
00:11:17,792 --> 00:11:20,625
(Christmas music)

335
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:26,476
- This girl just wrote her
name for the first time ever.

336
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:29,030
I go and I put the tape
in the refrigerator.

337
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,818
Losing my mind just a little bit.

338
00:11:30,818 --> 00:00:00,000
(Christmas music)
