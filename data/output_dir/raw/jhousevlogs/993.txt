1
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:01,896
- Raspberry.

2
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:04,271
- [Jeremy] Alright Isaac,
what are you thankful for?

3
00:00:04,271 --> 00:00:06,938
- I'm thankful for Thanksgiving.

4
00:00:09,438 --> 00:00:13,355
- I'm thankful for that
I love my whole family.

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,622
- I'm thankful for the gimungous turkey.

6
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:25,855
- I'm thankful for dang it,
you stole mine, Thanksgiving.

7
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:26,688
Let's see,

8
00:00:28,116 --> 00:00:29,154
gosh, I'm thankful for
our nice warm house.

9
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,165
It's cold out today.

10
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,479
- I am grateful for YouTube.

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,452
How cool is it that we get
to connect with our family

12
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,646
and friends and to meet
so many cool people.

13
00:00:39,646 --> 00:00:42,229
(upbeat music)

14
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,917
- Okay, so usually I'm totally
prepared for the holidays.

15
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,181
Okay, totally might be a
little bit of an exaggeration.

16
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:14,769
But this year, I'm completely
unprepared for Thanksgiving.

17
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:17,369
I am headed in, it's the
night before Thanksgiving

18
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,285
at like six pm to the grocery store.

19
00:01:19,285 --> 00:01:20,655
I know, kill me now right?

20
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:23,287
We're headed in and we
are going to hopefully

21
00:01:23,287 --> 00:01:26,062
get everything we need for
our Thanksgiving feast.

22
00:01:26,062 --> 00:01:27,850
We've gotten lucky, so far
they're had pretty much

23
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,383
everything that we've been looking for.

24
00:01:29,383 --> 00:01:32,424
The pies are looking a bit meager.

25
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:34,387
I'm wanting to do some
bacon in my green beans

26
00:01:34,387 --> 00:01:35,873
but I'm feeling kinda lazy.

27
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:37,846
So I saw this, look.

28
00:01:37,846 --> 00:01:39,429
Fully cooked bacon.

29
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:41,678
It's just like on the shelf.

30
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:43,257
It's not in the refrigerator section,

31
00:01:43,257 --> 00:01:44,545
it's not in the freezer section.

32
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:45,985
That just makes me nervous.

33
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:47,099
How can you just cook bacon

34
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:48,551
and put it in a box in a shelf?

35
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,002
I don't get it at all.

36
00:01:50,002 --> 00:01:52,475
Yep, I think we've got everything we need.

37
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:53,717
I think we're ready to check out

38
00:01:53,717 --> 00:01:56,654
and be ready for Thanksgiving.

39
00:01:56,654 --> 00:01:58,024
And guys, guess what,

40
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:00,161
I'm actually vlogging in public.

41
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,264
I hate doing this,

42
00:02:01,264 --> 00:02:02,097
so anyway.

43
00:02:03,446 --> 00:02:05,571
Hopefully I'll get better at it.

44
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:07,754
We're having our date night
with Sam and Nia tonight.

45
00:02:07,754 --> 00:02:08,949
- So exciting.

46
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:09,842
- It's truly exciting.

47
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:11,713
- Sam and Nia, and you
have to have some context

48
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:13,686
of how exciting this is for us.

49
00:02:13,686 --> 00:02:14,917
When we first started vlogging,

50
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,577
we were about two weeks in.

51
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:17,738
And this was just, I guess.

52
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:18,934
- Two or three weeks in, I don't remember,

53
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,675
but we had about 150 subscribers

54
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,858
and one morning we woke up

55
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,238
and saw that Sam and
Nia had subscribed to us

56
00:02:25,238 --> 00:02:27,119
and commented on our channel.

57
00:02:27,119 --> 00:02:30,068
Sam and Nia subscribed to us.

58
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:34,631
We got the memo, we knew you
wanted to be our friends too.

59
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,082
And we've shown you some of the footage

60
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:37,870
of our kind of freak out moment

61
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,623
of like oh my gosh, Sam and Nia.

62
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:41,202
- But when I was editing
it, Kendra kept coming

63
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,338
and she's like, no that's too much.

64
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:44,360
- That's too much.

65
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,637
They're gonna think we're crazy.

66
00:02:45,637 --> 00:02:48,782
We're going to show you a
little bit more of that footage.

67
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:50,049
- On our video where we talk about

68
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:52,790
how we secretly wanna be
friends with some vloggers,

69
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,267
we totally wanna be
friends with Sam and Nia.

70
00:02:55,267 --> 00:02:56,620
They are so cool.

71
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,199
- Yeah, I love their videos.

72
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,740
- They are so cool, I can't
believe they subscribed to us.

73
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,004
- Let's see if any of the
comments are from them.

74
00:03:04,004 --> 00:03:06,570
We're trying to figure out how
you respond to Sam and Nia.

75
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,276
It's hard 'cause you can't
really put all this into words.

76
00:03:08,276 --> 00:03:10,443
(screams)

77
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:13,559
It just doesn't come out the same on text.

78
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:14,592
- [Kendra] Too bad we can't do a

79
00:03:14,592 --> 00:03:18,087
video response to Sam and Nia commenting.

80
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:20,014
(screams)

81
00:03:20,014 --> 00:03:21,593
Thank you so much, we're so excited.

82
00:03:21,593 --> 00:03:23,555
Let's be best buds.

83
00:03:23,555 --> 00:03:26,156
- This is like if a really
pretty girl says hi to you

84
00:03:26,156 --> 00:03:27,862
and you make way more out of it.

85
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:31,020
They say hi and it's like oh she likes me

86
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,284
and wants to be dating me.

87
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:35,119
And then you totally overreact.

88
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:38,068
Yeah, we're totally
embarrassing ourselves.

89
00:03:38,068 --> 00:03:39,171
(laughter)

90
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:40,588
They are calling.

91
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:45,031
Hey.

92
00:03:46,032 --> 00:03:47,530
- Yay.

93
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,573
- The phone was ringing, we're
getting ready to actually

94
00:03:49,573 --> 00:03:51,709
talk with Sam and Nia for the first time.

95
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,973
What was going through your little

96
00:03:53,973 --> 00:03:55,761
mind and heart?

97
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:57,897
- I think I'm just really grateful

98
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:00,161
that I had already Face
Timed with Nia before

99
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,286
and she and I have talked and texted.

100
00:04:02,286 --> 00:04:05,699
So I actually was kind of
surprised that I didn't feel

101
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,754
uncomfortable or nervous.

102
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:09,844
It felt like oh look, there's my friend.

103
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:10,947
- Hi.

104
00:04:10,947 --> 00:04:14,864
- I spend so much time
watching you right here.

105
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:17,692
It's crazy.

106
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,271
- Yeah, nice to finally meet you.

107
00:04:19,271 --> 00:04:21,582
- It's good to meet you too.

108
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,987
- I like your earrings Kendra.

109
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:25,123
- Thanks, they're new.

110
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:28,060
- So it was neat for me to
get a chance to meet Sam.

111
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,430
He's totally down to earth.

112
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,263
It was fun that

113
00:04:30,263 --> 00:04:31,950
he knows about our kids.

114
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,330
He asked about Caleb and
what Caleb was up to.

115
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,444
- I love that you guys jump straight to

116
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:37,232
talking about your zits.

117
00:04:37,232 --> 00:04:38,065
- See that pimple?

118
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:39,751
- Oh yeah, it's looking better.

119
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:40,947
(laughter)

120
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,037
- It was like too big I couldn't pop it

121
00:04:43,037 --> 00:04:44,361
no matter how hard I squeezed it.

122
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:46,114
Finally she was able to get it out.

123
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:49,704
- YouTube's kinda funny like that.

124
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:52,081
You can show up with no makeup done

125
00:04:52,081 --> 00:04:53,753
or you can talk about your zits,

126
00:04:53,753 --> 00:04:55,077
or heck maybe you can talk about your poo,

127
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,818
I don't really know, we
haven't gotten there yet.

128
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:59,082
But it feels like life's
an open book on YouTube.

129
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,137
- Do you guys wanna hear about my poo?

130
00:05:01,137 --> 00:05:03,099
(laughter)

131
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:04,202
I was thinking about it, it's so funny

132
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:05,827
with building a relationship on YouTube,

133
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:07,708
like I actually know more about you

134
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,670
than any of my normal friends.

135
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,084
Because I see a good amount
of you every single day.

136
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:14,872
- You're quite the fan boy.

137
00:05:14,872 --> 00:05:16,451
(laughter)

138
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:17,391
- Yeah,

139
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,098
I may have embarrassed
myself a couple times.

140
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:21,745
- This is the last round,
we're gonna win it right now.

141
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:22,975
- Yeah, we'll see.

142
00:05:22,975 --> 00:05:23,892
- 14 to 17.

143
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:26,924
The topic is

144
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:33,248
workers that wear uniforms.

145
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:35,325
Ready go.

146
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:37,288
- Ring.

147
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:40,121
- Oh honey, that was way too fast.

148
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:43,200
- Hey, oh no, Kendra your list

149
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,222
is dismal.

150
00:05:44,222 --> 00:05:45,766
- That was way too fast.

151
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:48,366
- Okay, I put police, fire, nurse.

152
00:05:48,366 --> 00:05:49,388
- I did

153
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:50,537
nurse and police

154
00:05:50,537 --> 00:05:51,524
so we got two.

155
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:53,158
- We got two, so we got the two we needed

156
00:05:53,158 --> 00:05:55,387
but we didn't get the bonus points.

157
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:56,792
- Alright so where does
that put you guys at?

158
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,116
- That would put us at 16

159
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:00,043
so if you guys got three, then

160
00:06:00,043 --> 00:06:01,877
you win the game.

161
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:02,899
- We did not.

162
00:06:02,899 --> 00:06:04,048
(cheers)

163
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:06,695
- We have another chance.

164
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:08,695
We're still in it, yeah.

165
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:13,939
- And it's this one right
here, names of baby animals.

166
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,937
Names for baby animals.

167
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:20,395
- Names for baby animals?

168
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:22,566
Oh my gosh, there's no way.

169
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,553
- This is hard.

170
00:06:23,553 --> 00:06:26,699
- [Nia] I got this, I'm good.

171
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,882
- Next time I wanna
play Scattergories Nia.

172
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:30,716
- Oh my gosh, I love that game.

173
00:06:30,716 --> 00:06:31,549
- [Jeremy] Keep distracting her,

174
00:06:31,549 --> 00:06:34,083
keep saying things to distract her.

175
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,024
Ring.

176
00:06:35,024 --> 00:06:35,941
- Oh honey.

177
00:06:37,334 --> 00:06:39,505
- [Nia] Oh my gosh, you're
actually thinking of names.

178
00:06:39,505 --> 00:06:41,755
(laughter)

179
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:47,574
- Sam were you naming the animals?

180
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:48,933
