00:00:00,621 --> 00:00:03,732
- So of April of this year, it's 2014,

2
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:06,935
I stumbled across my first family vlog.

3
00:00:06,935 --> 00:00:08,243
It was Sam and Nia.

4
00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:09,692
I was like, well these
are just family videos

5
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:12,664
and I was kinda surprised that
1000 people had watched it,

6
00:00:12,664 --> 00:00:13,979
but they were a fun family and it was fun

7
00:00:13,979 --> 00:00:15,782
to watch what they were doing.

8
00:00:15,782 --> 00:00:18,144
And then I stumbled across
other family vloggers,

9
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:20,926
the next one I found was the Shaytards

10
00:00:20,926 --> 00:00:23,686
and they had five to six
hundred thousand people

11
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:26,407
watching every single day,
and that blew my mind,

12
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:30,039
I was baffled and at
first really confused,

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,903
like why are people watching
these 15 to 20 minute

14
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:35,155
home videos every day of this family?

15
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:38,944
As I kept watching, I
realized that you really

16
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:42,318
start to learn, you learn the family,

17
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:44,061
you learn their inside jokes and you start

18
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:46,262
to feel like you're building
a relationship with them.

19
00:00:46,262 --> 00:00:48,100
- It's very similar to when
you're watching a sitcom

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,568
or when you're watching a reality TV show,

21
00:00:50,568 --> 00:00:54,197
except for this is more
casual and in some ways,

22
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:56,955
that makes it feel more
intimate environment.

23
00:00:56,955 --> 00:00:58,810
- And you can interact with
them, you can tweet them,

24
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:02,015
you can follow their
Facebook page and they might

25
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:04,291
respond to you, which
happens occasionally.

26
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,980
That led me then to a
bunch of other family vlogs

27
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,499
and I realized that this is
a whole genre of YouTube.

28
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,059
- Jeremy and I just have
been really impressed

29
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:13,737
with several of the vlogs
that we've come across

30
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:15,575
and watching their families in action.

31
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,516
- A lot of different family
vloggers have done and said

32
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:19,843
things that have been inspiring
to us and have motivated me

33
00:01:19,843 --> 00:01:21,982
to wanna go forward and do a family vlog.

34
00:01:21,982 --> 00:01:25,708
- We're excited to have a
family vlog channel of our own.

35
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,370
- So I put in the links
below a lot of the channels

36
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:30,950
that we love, some of the family vloggers

37
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:32,787
that are some of our favorites
so you can look through

38
00:01:32,787 --> 00:01:37,056
and check our their channels
and see what they're doing.

39
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,056
- What is a family vlog?

40
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,685
Alright, Jeremy.

41
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,911
You better share his
head cold up high from me

42
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:45,585
so I don't have no double chin.

43
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:46,752
Thank you, hi.

44
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:50,224
(laughs)

45
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:51,141
- Yeah, so.

46
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:54,050
There it is.

47
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:55,606
- Okay.

48
00:01:55,606 --> 00:01:59,773
And that concludes this episode
of What Is a Family Vlog?

49
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:08,719
- So I'm gonna just try it one more time.

50
00:02:08,719 --> 00:00:00,000
- See ya there.
