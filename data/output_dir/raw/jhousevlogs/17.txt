1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,300
- I'm so glad that we vlog to document

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,920
important life moments
like this one right here.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:07,773
- [Jeremy] More.

4
00:00:07,773 --> 00:00:08,775
- [Kendra] More.

5
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,055
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:12,888
Hi.

7
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:14,800
- [Jeremy] Did you move
all of these yourself?

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,633
- [Caleb] Yup.

9
00:00:25,955 --> 00:00:27,070
- This morning, when she saw me

10
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,260
for the first time she was so happy.

11
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,020
She made the cutest little face.

12
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,648
I missed you big girl.

13
00:00:33,648 --> 00:00:34,481
(baby noises)

14
00:00:34,481 --> 00:00:35,610
Who's that?

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,130
Who's that beautiful baby?

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,710
A Birthday for Cow.

17
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:43,836
(kids laughing)

18
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:51,625
- She's like ah!

19
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:52,873
- [Jeremy] She's all over the place.

20
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:55,540
(girl laughing)

21
00:00:57,748 --> 00:00:59,791
(Jeremy laughing)

22
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:01,874
- [TV] Baby signing time.

23
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,150
- She's learning.

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,090
Janae is starting to
wanna communicate more

25
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,680
but she doesn't know how to so were gonna

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,990
be teaching her more and
more baby sign language.

27
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,823
- Shoes!

28
00:01:14,868 --> 00:01:16,560
- [Jeremy] She knows this one.

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,393
Shoes.

30
00:01:17,393 --> 00:01:18,484
- Shoes.

31
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:19,317
- [Jeremy] Shoes.

32
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:20,150
- Like a pair of shoes.

33
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,120
- [Jeremy] She's doin' it!

34
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:21,953
- [TV] You're turn.

35
00:01:21,953 --> 00:01:23,210
- [Jeremy] She's looking at everybody.

36
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,841
- Shoes.

37
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,290
- [Jeremy] Yeah, they're all doing it.

38
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:28,610
Shoes.

39
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,212
Yeah.

40
00:01:30,212 --> 00:01:31,607
- Shoes.

41
00:01:31,607 --> 00:01:33,730
- (laughing) She said shoes.

42
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,223
- [Jeremy] Socks.

43
00:01:35,223 --> 00:01:36,820
Yeah, socks.

44
00:01:38,007 --> 00:01:38,840
- Socks.

45
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,673
- Socks.

46
00:01:39,673 --> 00:01:41,197
- [TV] Sign socks.

47
00:01:41,197 --> 00:01:42,940
- [Jeremy] Janae's gonna have so many

48
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,911
little teachers growing
up, maybe too many.

49
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:46,990
(laughing)

50
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:47,970
- Donuts?

51
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,850
- Donuts!

52
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,240
- Here's the donuts and
I got some donut holes.

53
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,970
I don't know why I like
donut holes so much.

54
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,200
They're just donuts, just
smaller, but I like them.

55
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
They're just, like, cute.

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,433
- Wow.

57
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,663
- Mmmm.

58
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,200
- Poll question, do you prefer donuts

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,539
with cream inside or just regular?

60
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,450
Is there a big bird out there?

61
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,946
- A robin came.

62
00:02:12,946 --> 00:02:13,779
- [Jeremy] Oh cool.

63
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:14,612
- It's a big deal.

64
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:16,080
Robins are a sign of spring
and robins are starting

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,520
to show up at our bird feeder.

66
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,560
We just ate donuts, but I've actually been

67
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,820
spending the morning thinking about

68
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,610
some of the health goals and fitness stuff

69
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,650
that Jeremy and I want to get into.

70
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,260
We're feeling like it's
time to reset our bodies

71
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,150
and just feel healthier inside.

72
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,270
I'm making a smoothie which
has got some great ingredients

73
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,747
but I was looking at that
donut and eating it like,

74
00:02:34,747 --> 00:02:37,450
"Okay, this is like a last supper."

75
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,530
I need to get ready to move
on into some good new habits

76
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,130
that will serve my body
and my mind better.

77
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,640
But, oh man, donuts taste good.

78
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:49,559
(Kendra laughing)

79
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:50,392
- Shoes.

80
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:51,850
Shoes.

81
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,900
- [Kendra] These two have a special bond.

82
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,690
- [Jeremy] What did you do out here?

83
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,197
Is this your little barricaded fort?

84
00:03:05,197 --> 00:03:06,030
- Yeah.

85
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,550
- [Jeremy] Did you move
all of these yourself?

86
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:08,420
- [Caleb] Yup!

87
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,190
- [Jeremy] These are big pieces of wood.

88
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,030
What are you gonna do
in your fort all alone?

89
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,730
- I'm gonna let all my friends in.

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,552
- [Jeremy] Alright, have fun.

91
00:03:16,552 --> 00:03:19,302
(cheerful music)

92
00:03:23,066 --> 00:03:23,960
- See this one's good.

93
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,320
Now I need to keep nailing in this one.

94
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,730
So no one can just walk
right through here.

95
00:03:31,186 --> 00:03:33,769
(upbeat music)

96
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,757
- Caleb, you wanna come step on it?

97
00:03:46,757 --> 00:03:47,590
- Mhm.

98
00:03:53,197 --> 00:03:54,030
- [Jeremy] Then what do you want

99
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,030
to do with that to make it smooth?

100
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,863
- Sand it!

101
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,390
- [Jeremy] You can sand that down.

102
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,590
- I wanna saw more.

103
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,720
It's so fun.

104
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,350
- [Jeremy] Just remember
if you ever wanna do sawing

105
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,350
who do you need to ask right now?

106
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,580
- You.

107
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,143
- [Jeremy] Yup, I'll help you out, okay?

108
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,893
(rhythmic music)

109
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:15,310
- [Kendra] Returning
books, returning books.

110
00:04:19,937 --> 00:04:21,451
Did you find some books?

111
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,640
(baby noises)

112
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,580
Hi!

113
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,150
Doesn't she look so grown up?

114
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,210
Oh my goodness.

115
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,389
- Hi!

116
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:30,222
- Hi piggy!

117
00:04:36,847 --> 00:04:37,957
Hey!

118
00:04:37,957 --> 00:04:40,070
The library is like a
whole new world to Janae.

119
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,520
We haven't been with her in a little while

120
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,560
and with her learning to walk

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,920
she's just experiencing it
in a whole different way.

122
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,079
We're headed to Isaac's basketball game.

123
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:52,084
- Oh yeah!

124
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,370
Pump the bass!

125
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:58,484
- [Kendra] You need to
get your head in the game.

126
00:04:58,484 --> 00:04:59,330
- (kid singing) Get ya,
get ya head in the game.

127
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,724
Ya got get ya, get ya, get
ya, get ya head in the game.

128
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:06,224
(upbeat electronic music)

129
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,930
- [Jeremy] Today they
had all of the players

130
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,730
invite their teachers from school

131
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,730
and Isaac invited his PE teacher.

132
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:31,620
(baby noises)

133
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,470
Go get mom!

134
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,746
Get her!

135
00:05:33,746 --> 00:05:34,579
- Peek-a-boo!

136
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,611
Hi! (laughing)

137
00:05:35,611 --> 00:05:36,639
- [Jeremy] Hey.

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,472
- [Kendra] Who's that?

139
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:38,305
Go get daddy.

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,947
- [Jeremy] Hey! (laughing)

141
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:43,847
(Janae laughing)

142
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:45,240
A goo goo.

143
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:50,602
- Go!

144
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:51,870
(girls screaming)

145
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,430
With the weather just starting to warm up

146
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,920
this is one of Janae's first times

147
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,510
on a slide and she loves it.

148
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,189
One, two, three, go!

149
00:05:58,189 --> 00:05:59,551
(girls screaming)

150
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:01,162
- [Jeremy] Oh!

151
00:06:01,162 --> 00:06:02,841
- [Kendra] Go!

152
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,725
- [Jeremy] More.

153
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:04,558
- [Kendra] More.

154
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:05,391
- [Jeremy] More.

155
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,224
- More?

156
00:06:06,224 --> 00:06:07,270
Again?

157
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,395
(girls giggling)

158
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:11,330
- [Jeremy] That's a big step.

159
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:13,480
- Janae is truly becoming a toddler.

160
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,287
She's just barely 12 months.

161
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:17,639
She thinks she's a big girl.

162
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,389
(cheerful music)

163
00:06:36,204 --> 00:06:37,037
- Yeah!

164
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,030
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

165
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,050
They are swing dancing.

166
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:56,255
(boys laughing)

167
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,240
- We invented swing dancing.

168
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,206
Well I did.

169
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,330
- And I'm the second inventor of it.

170
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,320
- [Jeremy] Awesome.

171
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,390
You know it's funny, there is actually

172
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,450
a style of dance called swing dancing.

173
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,450
- I know, there is.

174
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,637
I was like, "Mom, I invented
something called swing dance."

175
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,105
"There's something already like that."

176
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:12,938
(Jeremy laughing)

177
00:07:12,938 --> 00:07:14,220
And I was like, no we do it on swings.

178
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,053
(Jeremy laughing)

179
00:07:18,196 --> 00:07:19,746
- I'm working on swing dancing.

180
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:22,760
I'm way better at the other kind.

181
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,340
- [Jeremy] Normal dancing?

182
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,680
- Oh look dad!

183
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,110
- Last fall we planted some bulbs

184
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,560
for tulips to come up this spring

185
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,530
and so we've had enough warm days in a row

186
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,050
that I had to come out and check
and see if they're growing.

187
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,700
They're not yet, but I wonder how many

188
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,310
warm days in a row we
need before they grow.

189
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,970
Jeremy and I went on a drive as part of

190
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,310
our date night tonight and we've just been

191
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:46,520
taking a ton and now we are
at a restaurant, Corner Cafe.

192
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,480
We're having some dinner.

193
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,060
We both ordered salad so I guess

194
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,230
that's our first attempt
towards healthiness,

195
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,440
but I'm mostly just hoping that

196
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,420
a motorcycle doesn't
fall on Jeremy's head.

197
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,253
See?

198
00:07:56,253 --> 00:07:57,210
It's just there.

199
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,520
- I don't know that this is
very healthy but it tastes good.

200
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,130
- [Kendra] It has the word salad in it.

201
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,850
and you're drinking water,
that's worth points.

202
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,740
- We both decided we're just gonna

203
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,440
eat half of it here and
take half of it home.

204
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,273
- [Kendra] For lunch tomorrow.

205
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:10,580
- Yeah, so it's easier to put it

206
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:13,150
in the to-go box before we start.

207
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,680
- [Kendra] Because look
how big these salads are.

208
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,840
They're huge!

209
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,860
This is half of my salad, what?

210
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,640
- [Jeremy] That heavenly smell.

211
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,250
Going into Bath and Body Works.

212
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,800
- It's pineapple mango.

213
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,230
The problem with this
one is I wanna drink it.

214
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,790
This would be an amazing smoothie.

215
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,110
- We were just saying how
there's something magical

216
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,330
about a really good smelling,

217
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,669
high quality hand soap at a bathroom.

218
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:37,239
It's special.

219
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,809
My feminine side is coming out.

220
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,642
- Is that just us?

221
00:08:39,643 --> 00:08:40,476
- Bath and Body Works.

222
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,090
- They have a soap testing station.

223
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:46,564
At least that's what we hope this is for.

224
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:47,955
(Jeremy laughing)

225
00:08:47,955 --> 00:08:49,000
Hey, that coconut one's really good.

226
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,460
You know you found a good
husband when he's willing to

227
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,560
come smell all the things at
Bath and Body Works with you.

228
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,393
Smell it.

229
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,520
- Mmm, I don't like that one as much.

230
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,050
- He's so cute.

231
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,210
I'm so glad that we vlog to document

232
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,900
important life moments
like this one right here.

233
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,980
I, Kendra, have made a
decision before Jeremy.

234
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm the more decisive one.

235
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,193
I'm ready to go.

236
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:14,812
My stuffs ready at the counter
and he's still deciding.

237
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:15,645
(squeaky voice) Oh look at him!

238
00:09:15,645 --> 00:09:16,780
- There's so many good smells.

239
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:20,280
- [Kendra] I know, what are
you gonna do? (laughing)

240
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,980
Classic Jeremy move, pick up some

241
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,339
random one that you haven't even tried.

242
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,172
- Love it.

243
00:09:25,172 --> 00:09:26,005
(both laughing)

244
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:28,650
- [Kendra] He's back at it
washing his hands some more.

245
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,210
- This is the cherry blossom,

246
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,240
it's like a classic smell here.

247
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,164
The random one that I
picked up to leave with

248
00:09:34,164 --> 00:09:36,460
is my favorite one of all of 'em.

249
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,790
It's like a really strong cherry smell.

250
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,000
- [Kendra] It smells so good.

251
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,110
Let's show 'em the one.

252
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,470
- [Jeremy] It's right here.

253
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,303
Cherry.

254
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,453
That was fun.

255
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:47,040
- Are you following me?

256
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,000
- [Jeremy] I'm your date.

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,860
- [Little Girl] Goodnight.

258
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,563
J House out.

259
00:09:50,563 --> 00:09:52,198
- [Kendra] Happy birthday big girl.

260
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,781
Here they come, the main event.

261
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:57,905
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

262
00:09:57,905 --> 00:10:00,655
(cheerful music)

263
00:10:02,342 --> 00:10:03,708
- [Together] Yay!

264
00:10:03,708 --> 00:00:00,000
Happy birthday to you!
