1
00:00:00,584 --> 00:00:02,371
- We have been vlogging for one month,

2
00:00:02,371 --> 00:00:04,621
and we wanted to step aside

3
00:00:05,711 --> 00:00:08,754
from just showing our
normal, everyday family life,

4
00:00:08,754 --> 00:00:10,233
and show what our YouTube life

5
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:11,966
has been like this last month.

6
00:00:11,966 --> 00:00:14,751
I know a lot of you watch family vloggers,

7
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,898
and I had no idea that this month

8
00:00:16,898 --> 00:00:18,403
would be like what it was,

9
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:19,653
and the emotions that we had,

10
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,845
and the experiences that we had.

11
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:23,063
We wanted to put some of that out there

12
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:24,225
to give you a little sneak peak

13
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:27,318
into what it's been like to
jump into the YouTube world

14
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,007
with both feet.

15
00:00:29,007 --> 00:00:33,174
(energetic bouncy orchestra music)

16
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,497
Is it going?

17
00:00:49,497 --> 00:00:50,330
- Yes.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,323
- Is it going?

19
00:00:51,323 --> 00:00:53,272
- Could you zoom into our different faces?

20
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:54,105
- [Woman] Yeah.

21
00:00:54,105 --> 00:00:56,438
- Not zoom, but come closer.

22
00:00:57,645 --> 00:01:01,321
We are family (mumbles).

23
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,454
I got all my sugar to me.

24
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:06,287
(everyone laughs)

25
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:15,090
Okay, the photo's napping.

26
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:18,246
- We are family.

27
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:21,663
We are recording.
- We're live.

28
00:01:21,663 --> 00:01:24,663
- Under a camera for the first time.

29
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm about to make my
first J House vlog public.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,041
This is an exciting moment.

31
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,050
Look how excited Kendra is.

32
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,080
- I'm super excited.

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,284
- It happened.

34
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:38,117
We did it.

35
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,016
We have a vlog.

36
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:41,234
We have a video on our vlog.

37
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:44,675
We have a video on J House Vlogs.

38
00:01:44,675 --> 00:01:47,108
I think you're up to
six Instagram followers.

39
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,227
- Yes.

40
00:01:48,227 --> 00:01:52,394
- I'm up to five Twitter,
Tweeter, Twitter followers,

41
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,535
but we do have 28 subscribers

42
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:56,781
on our YouTube channel,

43
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:57,614
so that's good.

44
00:01:57,614 --> 00:01:58,772
Not all of them are family.

45
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:00,051
We can't see several of 'em.

46
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:02,134
- Only two of 'em are us.

47
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,183
- That's true.

48
00:02:04,183 --> 00:02:05,403
You keep turning the camera away from me.

49
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:07,243
- You said you would trust me.

50
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:08,267
I think he wants to make love.

51
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,332
- Here's Kendra videoing.

52
00:02:10,332 --> 00:02:11,823
(laughs)

53
00:02:11,823 --> 00:02:13,517
- That's why I keep turning it,

54
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,082
'cause you're holding it like this,

55
00:02:15,082 --> 00:02:17,436
and I'm not even in that video.

56
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,652
- We don't have one of the cameras

57
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,064
where you can see the picture.

58
00:02:20,064 --> 00:02:20,904
- There we go.

59
00:02:20,904 --> 00:02:21,873
- Hopefully we're in it.

60
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:22,706
- We'll just hold it like this.

61
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:23,547
- That's funny (chuckles).

62
00:02:23,547 --> 00:02:24,811
- How are you feeling about it?

63
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,204
I am feeling a little bit scared,

64
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:28,037
a little bit vulnerable,

65
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,167
like this dream that was like,

66
00:02:29,167 --> 00:02:30,589
well this'll be fun.

67
00:02:30,589 --> 00:02:32,323
It is becoming more of a reality,

68
00:02:32,323 --> 00:02:34,261
and even though I knew
when we were filming stuff,

69
00:02:34,261 --> 00:02:37,080
that I was taking an
inside portion of my life

70
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,263
and putting it out there.

71
00:02:38,263 --> 00:02:39,555
Now it's actually out there.

72
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:41,204
- When you were just
getting to know someone,

73
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:44,996
you don't always put out all
of your most vulnerable things,

74
00:02:44,996 --> 00:02:46,642
and I can see that we're doing that

75
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,010
with our YouTube channel too.

76
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,795
As we're editing,
sometimes we're taking out

77
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,235
some of the more vulnerable parts.

78
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:52,451
I think we'll open up more,

79
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:56,163
and be authentic, and
allow more parts of us

80
00:02:56,163 --> 00:02:59,642
to be seen as we feel
more comfortable with it.

81
00:02:59,642 --> 00:03:00,649
I'm excited.

82
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:02,443
I wish I had more time for it.

83
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:04,698
It's hard because we still
have four little kids.

84
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:07,648
I still have clients who are calling me

85
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,187
and emailing me all the time.

86
00:03:09,187 --> 00:03:11,294
- Caleb, what did you way in your prayer?

87
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:14,403
- That mom's not losing her brain.

88
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,861
- He said, "We're thankful that
mom's not losing her brain."

89
00:03:16,861 --> 00:03:18,042
Your family is amazing.

90
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:19,164
I'm 20 years old, and I see your family,

91
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:21,711
and I think this is where
I one day want to be.

92
00:03:21,711 --> 00:03:23,027
Your videos are so inspiring,

93
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:25,585
and I love the attention
you give your children,

94
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:26,418
and make them all feel special.

95
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:28,443
- [Jeremy] Caleb, go to the (laughs)-

96
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:30,073
- Thanks for taking the
time to make these videos.

97
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,823
You guys are awesome.

98
00:03:33,352 --> 00:03:34,519
We have a fan.

99
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:39,139
- Wait, we have a fan
who's not our family,

100
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:41,370
or someone who's obligated to like us.

101
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,127
- It's awesome, he
doesn't have to like us.

102
00:03:43,127 --> 00:03:43,960
Yay.

103
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,343
- I got the tricycle, but
once again I'm chasing Caleb.

104
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:52,426
Cue more footage of us chasing Caleb.

105
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:59,492
Kendra right now is Skyping
with another YouTuber

106
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:00,449
that we met.

107
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:02,239
- [Woman] In duck lake.

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,439
- No, don't film us right now Jeremy.

109
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,108
- [Jeremy] Can I vlog you, rip a crick?

110
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:06,941
- [Woman] Sure.

111
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:08,201
- [Jeremy] Wait, let me see if I did this,

112
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,649
from Japan.

113
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,839
- Hi.

114
00:04:10,839 --> 00:04:12,905
- [Jeremy] What's your channel?

115
00:04:12,905 --> 00:04:13,907
- Mint2Be.

116
00:04:13,907 --> 00:04:14,740
- [Jeremy] Okay.

117
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
- [Kendra] We'll show your channel.

118
00:04:15,573 --> 00:04:16,564
- [Jeremy] Well there we
go, sorry, I'll let you guys

119
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:17,795
get back to your conversation.

120
00:04:17,795 --> 00:04:18,628
- Okay.

121
00:04:18,628 --> 00:04:20,884
- I think I embarrassed
Kendra a little bit.

122
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:22,506
This little bundle of goodness.

123
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:25,496
(gurgles)

124
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:27,996
(baby laughs)

125
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:31,938
- This is kind of embarrassing.

126
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,628
The embarrassing part is that
we just had a whole discussion

127
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:38,251
about this, but the memory
card wasn't in the camera.

128
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:39,469
The other embarrassing part

129
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:41,180
is that it's 3:00 a.m.,

130
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,508
and I just finished editing.

131
00:04:43,508 --> 00:04:44,481
- [Kendra] At around-

132
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,582
- Are you okay if I show you?

133
00:04:46,582 --> 00:04:48,301
That just is funny.

134
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:50,564
- Hello (chuckles).

135
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:52,505
- With the growth, and
the newness of the vlog,

136
00:04:52,505 --> 00:04:54,123
Kendra and I had to commit today

137
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:57,120
that we wouldn't look from
the time that if left to work

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,043
until lunch.

139
00:04:58,043 --> 00:04:59,024
What happened while we were gone?

140
00:04:59,024 --> 00:05:03,521
- Well, we jumped from
87 to 96 subscribers,

141
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:05,208
and we got loads of comments.

142
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,559
Now, just since we've been home,

143
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,341
anyway, we're up to 98.

144
00:05:10,341 --> 00:05:12,594
I think we're coming up on the 100 mark.

145
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:13,427
- It's a big deal.

146
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:15,121
It's a milestone to hit 100.

147
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,783
- You have to look at the camera.

148
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:20,107
- It's a big deal to hit 100.

149
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:20,978
It was 10 minutes ago.

150
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,803
We think we might be at 100 now.

151
00:05:22,803 --> 00:05:24,177
Let's see.

152
00:05:24,177 --> 00:05:25,664
- We're so eager.

153
00:05:25,664 --> 00:05:26,720
- I can't see it.
- 99.

154
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,347
- [Jeremy] There it is.

155
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:29,989
We're so close.

156
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,182
- So close.

157
00:05:31,182 --> 00:05:32,529
Shall we refresh it again?

158
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:33,417
- [Jeremy] Yeah, let's do.

159
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,250
Okay.

160
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,083
Let's see.

161
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,830
Okay, go ahead, refresh it.

162
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,015
- [Kendra] I did refresh it.

163
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,219
- [Jeremy] Refresh it again.

164
00:05:42,219 --> 00:05:43,802
- [Kendra] Dang it.

165
00:05:45,283 --> 00:05:46,717
All right, go back to work.

166
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:49,050
- Oh, I have to go work now.

167
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:51,986
- [Kendra] Caleb.

168
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:55,080
- We found him with the razor.

169
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,555
He had already taken one swipe.

170
00:05:57,555 --> 00:05:59,050
- [Kendra] Luckily no blood.

171
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,514
Caleb, how'd you even get up here?

172
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:03,597
- I climbed right there, right there.

173
00:06:05,357 --> 00:06:06,438
- How'd he climb up here?

174
00:06:06,438 --> 00:06:07,685
- We're having some growing pains

175
00:06:07,685 --> 00:06:09,246
trying to figure out how to make this work

176
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:11,444
in our daily life, and with our family,

177
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:13,012
'cause we definitely
don't want it to take away

178
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:17,744
from our kids and the
attention we can give them,

179
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:19,911
in our lives that we have.

180
00:06:21,405 --> 00:06:23,488
Anyway, just being real about the balance

181
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:25,094
that we're trying to learn,

182
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,706
and ooh, wanted me to be real smart.

183
00:06:27,706 --> 00:06:29,463
Here's my bathroom.

184
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:31,094
Oh, what a mess.

185
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:33,503
Okay, so Jeremy and I are having a contest

186
00:06:33,503 --> 00:06:36,125
to see who's the better camera holder.

187
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,485
I feel like I do a pretty good job

188
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:38,733
of holding the camera.

189
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:40,778
- I think your finger's
over the mike right now.

190
00:06:40,778 --> 00:06:42,028
- Aah, dang it.

191
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:45,172
All right.

192
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,005
- Jeremy's turn.

193
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,752
- Now it's Jeremy's turn to try.

194
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:49,532
Where are the mikes on the camera?

195
00:06:49,532 --> 00:06:51,199
- That's right here.

196
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:55,832
(quiet scream)

197
00:06:57,557 --> 00:06:59,640
- Jeremy, come here, 150.

198
00:07:03,468 --> 00:07:04,373
Yes.

199
00:07:04,373 --> 00:07:06,541
70 have subscribed to us.

200
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:08,230
(quiet scream)

201
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,730
Look, Sam and Nia.

202
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:14,175
- Sam and Nia are the
first family vloggers

203
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,419
that I ever started watching.

204
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:19,693
I started them the day
before their day one

205
00:07:19,693 --> 00:07:21,717
of vlogging, which was
their April Fools' one.

206
00:07:21,717 --> 00:07:24,387
- I can't believe they subscribed to us.

207
00:07:24,387 --> 00:07:26,499
- Let's see if any of the
comments are from them.

208
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,666
- [Kendra] That little
spider of yours is adorable.

209
00:07:31,754 --> 00:07:33,925
- It's so funny, 'cause I
mean, I know that Sam and Nia

210
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:38,322
aren't celebrities, but you
feel like you know them.

211
00:07:38,322 --> 00:07:40,745
These are like friends, but
they didn't know about us.

212
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:41,578
Do you know what I mean?

213
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,099
That's one of the things is, I mean,

214
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:45,309
I feel like just know them

215
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,396
and they are friends of mine.

216
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:47,387
They didn't even know who we are,

217
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:50,051
and now it's like they're meeting us

218
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:51,034
now for the first time.

219
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,774
It's kind of exciting too.

220
00:07:52,774 --> 00:07:54,982
YouTube is so cool.

221
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:58,121
- We're not like crazy stalkers.

222
00:07:58,121 --> 00:08:00,677
- Well we already know where they live,

223
00:08:00,677 --> 00:08:02,045
and we're coming.

224
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:04,273
We're going to show up
at the door at 2:00 a.m.

225
00:08:04,273 --> 00:08:05,106
We're here.

226
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:07,241
You shared our video.

227
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,180
- We got the memo.

228
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,798
We knew you wanted to be our friends too.

229
00:08:11,798 --> 00:08:16,239
- Kendra was wearing
these super sexy pants.

230
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,141
Am I allowed to say that?

231
00:08:17,141 --> 00:08:17,974
- No.

232
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,859
- It's just PG.

233
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:21,098
She was.

234
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:23,848
- What do you think you should do

235
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:26,042
to be obedient?

236
00:08:29,072 --> 00:08:32,587
- [Kendra] That's a great question.

237
00:08:32,587 --> 00:08:33,419
- [Jeremy] Kendra's nursing.

238
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,135
I almost accidentally got
some of that in there.

239
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:38,662
- [Kendra] Okay dad, what
do you think you could do

240
00:08:38,663 --> 00:08:40,191
to be more obedient?

241
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,436
That was the question of the lesson.

242
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:45,603
- [Jeremy] To be more obedient,
I need to pay attention more

243
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:48,544
to what the rules are.

244
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:50,950
Sometimes I ignore the rules,

245
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,746
or I forget about them, and
to try to remember the rules

246
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,311
would help me out.

247
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:56,650
- [Kendra] I think sometimes for me,

248
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,509
what I need to do to
be more patient is to,

249
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:01,650
not patient,

250
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,398
to be more obedient is to-

251
00:09:04,398 --> 00:09:07,145
Jeremy, what just happened?

252
00:09:07,145 --> 00:09:09,022
- We made money.

253
00:09:09,022 --> 00:09:10,939
We're up to four cents.

254
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:16,256
We end on the 11th of
October with 204 subscribers.

255
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,766
That's pretty exciting.

256
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:23,933
- [Kendra] Wait, you didn't
capture my enthusiasm.

257
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:28,452
- [Jeremy] I think I hadn't
turned off the camera yet,

258
00:09:28,452 --> 00:09:31,560
so I think we caught your enthusiasm.

259
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,477
It's because it's like-

260
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:35,565
- [Kendra] It's really October 12th.

261
00:09:35,565 --> 00:09:36,398
- 1:30.

262
00:09:37,714 --> 00:09:38,737
- Nope not is what we're doing.

263
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:41,715
- Here's the best part of
our behind the scenes footage

264
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:44,965
is Kendra in bed at two in the morning.

265
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,915
Thanks for following us.

266
00:09:48,915 --> 00:09:52,773
We hope you don't leave
now that we've scared you.

267
00:09:52,773 --> 00:09:54,062
- The next day we're go refresh is

268
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:56,546
there's going to be they
haven't subscribed to us.

269
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:58,766
- Like dead silence.

270
00:09:58,766 --> 00:09:59,599
We don't know where they went.

271
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,432
- Foiled.

272
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,887
- Sorry.

273
00:10:01,887 --> 00:00:00,000
(energetic, bouncy orchestra music)
