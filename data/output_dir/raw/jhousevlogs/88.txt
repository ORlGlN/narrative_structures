1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:01,659
- I mean I had to like really bend down

2
00:00:01,659 --> 00:00:04,130
and push with my legs to walk.

3
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,043
If only you could find a
jolly man with a beard.

4
00:00:06,043 --> 00:00:07,556
- He's downstairs.
(bright music)

5
00:00:07,556 --> 00:00:08,389
(gasps)

6
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:09,440
- Here it is.
- Beautiful.

7
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,199
- The last step is the star.

8
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:13,782
(bright music)

9
00:00:18,526 --> 00:00:19,381
Good morning friends.

10
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:20,813
I am so excited today,

11
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:23,365
because we are going to get
all set up for Christmas.

12
00:00:23,365 --> 00:00:24,478
We don't decorate too much,

13
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:25,496
but just that little bit,

14
00:00:25,496 --> 00:00:26,535
it makes a big difference.

15
00:00:26,535 --> 00:00:27,618
I'm really hoping it'll make it feel

16
00:00:27,618 --> 00:00:29,666
more Christmas-y around here.

17
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:33,002
I'm smiling because our
house is cleaned up.

18
00:00:33,002 --> 00:00:34,929
This is way better than before.

19
00:00:34,929 --> 00:00:36,145
I'm feeling super accomplished

20
00:00:36,145 --> 00:00:37,715
because I cleaned my room.

21
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,314
My room has been the dumping ground

22
00:00:39,314 --> 00:00:41,434
for all sorts of things and check it out.

23
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:45,585
Ahhh.
(enchanting music)

24
00:00:45,585 --> 00:00:47,823
This is as close to clean as my room gets

25
00:00:47,823 --> 00:00:50,511
and I am really happy with it.

26
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:51,344
I'm hoping by the end of today

27
00:00:51,344 --> 00:00:53,273
that we feel a lot more
ready for Christmas.

28
00:00:53,273 --> 00:00:56,786
Poll question, are you
ready for Christmas?

29
00:00:56,786 --> 00:01:00,453
("Flight of the Bumblebee")

30
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:16,081
- I'm putting my baby to sleep.

31
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:17,748
- [Jeremy] Good job.

32
00:01:20,304 --> 00:01:22,769
- So we usually decorate
our tree in the evenings

33
00:01:22,769 --> 00:01:24,246
and so it feels weird to decorate
in the middle of the day,

34
00:01:24,246 --> 00:01:25,424
but we have time in the middle of the day

35
00:01:25,424 --> 00:01:26,257
and we're busy tonight,

36
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:27,553
so we're gonna decorate our tree.

37
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,561
Do you guys want to see the lights?

38
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:29,394
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:30,820
("We Wish You a Merry Christmas")

40
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,653
(gasps)

41
00:01:31,653 --> 00:01:33,820
- There is it.
- Beautiful.

42
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:37,217
- Cool.

43
00:01:37,217 --> 00:01:38,050
- [Jeremy] Alright, we need to start

44
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,200
adding ornaments and stuff.

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,048
This is Nae Nae's first time

46
00:01:41,048 --> 00:01:43,465
to decorate a Christmas tree.

47
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,815
She's like a little bit hesitant.

48
00:01:49,815 --> 00:01:51,917
- She doesn't know what it is.
- She touched it.

49
00:01:51,917 --> 00:01:53,750
- [Kendra] You did it.

50
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,821
- [Jeremy] I'm out of here.

51
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,163
(laughing)

52
00:01:57,163 --> 00:01:58,382
This is crazy.

53
00:01:58,382 --> 00:01:59,852
- This is our tub of ornaments.

54
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,947
I'm gonna take 'em over
to the kitchen table,

55
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,668
and you guys can carry them over.

56
00:02:02,668 --> 00:02:04,410
(bright music)

57
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,643
- There's a certain
ornament that's my favorite.

58
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:08,632
- Which one is it?
- Ooh.

59
00:02:08,632 --> 00:02:10,904
- It's like that moose one.

60
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:13,492
- It's probably a reindeer.
- We'll have to find it.

61
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:16,601
- There's not too many moose
decorations at Christmas time.

62
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,187
- It's that one right there.

63
00:02:18,187 --> 00:02:19,020
- [Kendra] It's this one?

64
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,853
- Yeah.

65
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:21,484
- This one's Isaac's favorite.

66
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:23,339
- It's legs move.

67
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:25,939
- My favorite is this one.

68
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:27,539
My favorite one is the star,

69
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:29,331
because it glows.

70
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,509
- So this one's my favorite.

71
00:02:30,509 --> 00:02:32,187
I got it when I was younger.

72
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:34,282
- Where's the one's we actually made?

73
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:35,809
- Ooh, they're in this box.

74
00:02:35,809 --> 00:02:36,967
- [Jeremy] The J house.

75
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,055
- Here's the J house.

76
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:39,473
- [Jeremy] Do you guys
remember who made that?

77
00:02:39,473 --> 00:02:40,306
- Yeah.
- No.

78
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:41,139
- Yeah.

79
00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:43,214
- Jeremy's brothers made this for us.

80
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:45,588
Isaac, 2014.
(bright music)

81
00:02:45,588 --> 00:02:47,957
Elise you made this one in 2013.

82
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:51,420
- Yeah, I didn't know
where to put the scarf.

83
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,861
- [Kendra] Caleb, check it out.

84
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,363
You made that one.

85
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:55,332
(laughing)

86
00:02:55,332 --> 00:02:56,409
- [Jeremy] A Picasso.

87
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,399
- [Kendra] Here's Isaac.

88
00:02:58,399 --> 00:02:59,232
You did that one.

89
00:02:59,232 --> 00:03:00,521
- Oh yeah, I made both of these.

90
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,451
- [Kendra] Lise, you did that one.

91
00:03:02,451 --> 00:03:03,914
- Which one did I do?

92
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:06,198
- This one's my second Christmas.

93
00:03:06,198 --> 00:03:07,213
- [Kendra] Caleb.

94
00:03:07,213 --> 00:03:08,302
- [Jeremy] Is that Caleb?

95
00:03:08,302 --> 00:03:09,240
- [Kendra] That one's Caleb.

96
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,073
- [Jeremy] The wrapped baby Jesus.

97
00:03:14,965 --> 00:03:17,893
- I remember him making that one.

98
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,317
- Laura, we made some of these

99
00:03:19,317 --> 00:03:20,150
when you were really little,

100
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,812
and so you didn't make 'em yet.

101
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:24,648
This year you can make one, okay?

102
00:03:24,648 --> 00:03:25,481
You know what?

103
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,342
I made this one,

104
00:03:26,342 --> 00:03:28,330
but we can share it.

105
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,892
(bright music)

106
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:32,820
- I'm gonna do this one pretty high.

107
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,320
- Mine right here.

108
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:50,405
- [Jeremy] You're tall enough

109
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,612
to get them up there pretty tall.

110
00:03:51,612 --> 00:03:52,445
- Yeah.

111
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,073
- Our tree decorating
strategy is a little different

112
00:03:54,073 --> 00:03:55,350
this year, with Janae.

113
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,895
- [Jeremy] Nothing on the bottom.

114
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:57,753
(laughing)

115
00:03:57,753 --> 00:03:59,000
- So the stuff on the bottom has to be

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,875
not breakable, and also,
not able to hurt Janae.

117
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,201
We're just starting up
a little bit higher.

118
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,370
- We need to put some more

119
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,246
over on this side.

120
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,817
- This is one of my favorites.

121
00:04:07,817 --> 00:04:08,667
See Nae Nae?

122
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:10,250
There's baby Jesus.

123
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,421
That's baby Jesus.

124
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:15,158
You want to help Nae Nae.

125
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,480
Can you put it on the tree?

126
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,808
I'll help you, we can do it together.

127
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:20,589
Oh she wants it back.

128
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,526
Look we leave it on the tree.

129
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:25,568
- [Jeremy] But I want that, it's my toy.

130
00:04:25,568 --> 00:04:26,863
It's a whole tree of toys

131
00:04:26,863 --> 00:04:29,864
to taunt you all season long Nae Nae.

132
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:32,447
(bright music)

133
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:38,888
- The last step is the star.

134
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:40,971
- Stick it up right here.

135
00:04:42,005 --> 00:04:42,838
How does that look?

136
00:04:42,838 --> 00:04:43,671
- Yay.
- Yay!

137
00:04:43,671 --> 00:04:44,714
(clapping)

138
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:45,547
- We did it.

139
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,714
- [Caleb] Yay!

140
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:52,068
- [Kendra] Okay we'll
have to wait until tonight

141
00:04:52,068 --> 00:04:54,735
to see how it looks all glowing.

142
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:04,201
Laura look at my nose, Caleb.

143
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,641
Laura.

144
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,179
(Kendra laughs)

145
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:10,756
Got out the girls' Christmas hair bows.

146
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:13,491
- My favorite one is this one.

147
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:15,283
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

148
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,908
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

149
00:05:16,908 --> 00:05:18,660
- [Kendra] Somebody's feeling Christmas-y.

150
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,427
The kids found the Santa hats.

151
00:05:20,427 --> 00:05:21,836
The kids are discovering
all of the goodies

152
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:23,043
in the Christmas bins.

153
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:24,204
We have three Christmas bins

154
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:25,564
and I'm working my way through each one,

155
00:05:25,564 --> 00:05:27,737
getting out decorations or ornaments

156
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:28,945
or just other stuff.

157
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:29,778
Check this one out

158
00:05:29,778 --> 00:05:31,641
that a viewer made for us.

159
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,999
I love it, it looks like a
little J house gingerbread house.

160
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,445
Did you find the Christmas socks?

161
00:05:36,445 --> 00:05:37,902
- Yeah.
(playful music)

162
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:39,571
- Christmas socks.

163
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:40,615
- Look at mine.

164
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,157
- [Kendra] Did you find
your Christmas socks?

165
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:44,394
Oh but you're putting them on.

166
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:46,956
- [Caleb] It's time to be elves guys.

167
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,116
- [Kendra] Are you gonna be elves?

168
00:05:48,116 --> 00:05:49,022
- Yep.
- Uh-huh.

169
00:05:49,022 --> 00:05:51,276
- [Kendra] If only you could
find a jolly man with a beard.

170
00:05:51,276 --> 00:05:52,554
- That's Daddy.

171
00:05:52,554 --> 00:05:53,850
- He's downstairs.

172
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,220
- [Kendra] He's working though.

173
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,004
Janae does not know what's going on.

174
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,287
- [Jeremy] Nae nae.

175
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:00,337
(laughing)

176
00:06:00,337 --> 00:06:01,960
How was your nap?

177
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,920
Laura, how did you get in there?

178
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,856
- From Mom.

179
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:06,348
- [Jeremy] She put you in?

180
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:07,298
- Alright, you guys let us know

181
00:06:07,298 --> 00:06:10,715
when you are done playing in there, okay?

182
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:17,886
- [Kendra] Say that again?

183
00:06:17,886 --> 00:06:19,216
- Negativity.

184
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:20,133
- Nativaty.

185
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,323
- Nativity.

186
00:06:23,323 --> 00:06:24,380
- [Kendra] Nativity.

187
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,634
- I want to sign up for it.

188
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:27,146
- [Kendra] What's a nativity?

189
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:29,293
- It's where kids get to act

190
00:06:29,293 --> 00:06:32,293
when Jesus was born and other stuff.

191
00:06:33,205 --> 00:06:34,378
- Which part would you want?

192
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:38,545
- I'd want to be a shepherd
or maybe Joseph or somebody.

193
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,644
- Or maybe baby Jesus?

194
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:43,477
- No.

195
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:45,848
- What you talking about?

196
00:06:45,848 --> 00:06:46,739
(Kendra laughs)

197
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,370
- That would be Janae's job.

198
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:49,357
- [Kendra] I was joking Cubby.

199
00:06:49,357 --> 00:06:50,339
- I would be Mary

200
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,467
and I would be holding Janae.

201
00:06:52,467 --> 00:06:53,300
- [Kendra] Yeah?

202
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,017
- I want to be the baby.

203
00:06:55,017 --> 00:06:56,338
- [Kendra] You'd want to be the baby?

204
00:06:56,338 --> 00:06:57,602
I think you might be a little bit big

205
00:06:57,602 --> 00:06:59,107
to be baby Jesus.

206
00:06:59,107 --> 00:07:00,847
- I would be like this.

207
00:07:00,847 --> 00:07:01,848
- [Kendra] You'd kind of crouch up?

208
00:07:01,848 --> 00:07:03,000
So Isaac, if you were
gonna be in the nativity,

209
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,667
what would you want to be?

210
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:05,728
- Wise man.

211
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,287
- [Kendra] You are very wise.

212
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:09,368
Nae Nae, you're sitting on the books.

213
00:07:09,368 --> 00:07:10,675
You're supposed to read the books,

214
00:07:10,675 --> 00:07:12,508
not sit on them silly.

215
00:07:13,528 --> 00:07:14,792
(Kendra laughs)

216
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:16,028
One of my favorite things
that we've been doing

217
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:17,371
is spending a lot of time

218
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,922
reading our stash of Christmas books.

219
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:23,018
Comment below, what is your
favorite Christmas book to read?

220
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:25,264
Reindeer's Christmas Surprise.

221
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,641
Reindeer sat in his
armchair humming to himself.

222
00:07:27,641 --> 00:07:28,928
He looked at his tree,

223
00:07:28,928 --> 00:07:30,689
its branches glowed with lights,

224
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,877
all the presents were
wrapped up and ready.

225
00:07:32,877 --> 00:07:35,877
(chill jazzy music)

226
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,661
We are headed out.

227
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,302
It feels like it's super late at night,

228
00:07:40,302 --> 00:07:41,508
it's just after five o'clock,

229
00:07:41,508 --> 00:07:43,769
but it's already getting dark over here.

230
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:47,269
So we are headed to a children's nativity.

231
00:07:50,404 --> 00:07:51,444
The family that we're friends with

232
00:07:51,444 --> 00:07:52,606
in our community puts this on,

233
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,825
and what an amazing effort and endeavor

234
00:07:54,825 --> 00:07:56,944
to put on a whole community event.

235
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:57,960
It's amazing.

236
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,425
- [Jeremy] We're trying
to bundle up Janae.

237
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,133
It's cold out here.
- She doesn't the hat.

238
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,631
- [Jeremy] It's windy and cold.

239
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:05,420
- It was warm today,

240
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,612
but there's a strong wind coming in.

241
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,487
(bright guitar music)

242
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:13,302
Everybody's layered up

243
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,325
with a couple of jackets on,

244
00:08:15,325 --> 00:08:17,433
a couple pairs of pants on, and some hats.

245
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,433
It's still kind of cold.

246
00:08:32,827 --> 00:08:35,740
- [Man] Because there was
no room for them in the end.

247
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,053
♪ The stars in the heaven ♪

248
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:44,400
♪ Looked down where he lay ♪

249
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,733

251
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:56,448
- [Jeremy] Look you guys there's a donkey.

252
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:59,057
Do you want to pet the donkey?

253
00:08:59,057 --> 00:09:00,474
- Oh my goodness.

254
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:04,202
- [Jeremy] It was windy.

255
00:09:04,202 --> 00:09:08,041
- We had children literally
crying as we walked away,

256
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,464
because they were scared they were gonna

257
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:11,112
get blown away by the wind.

258
00:09:11,112 --> 00:09:11,945
It was intense.

259
00:09:11,945 --> 00:09:13,543
- And they were being blown away.

260
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,641
- I know, we kept losing our hats,

261
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:18,261
and there was a point I
had to really bend down

262
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:20,761
and push with my legs to walk.

263
00:09:21,869 --> 00:09:23,253
Woo.

264
00:09:23,253 --> 00:09:24,420
- One, lights.

265
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:27,403
- [Kendra] Ta da!

266
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:29,608
- Yay!

267
00:09:29,608 --> 00:09:30,838
- [Kendra] Isn't that beautiful?

268
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:31,776
Who's hungry?

269
00:09:31,776 --> 00:09:32,609
- Me.
- Me!

270
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:38,436
- So we're watching the
Great Christmas Light Fight

271
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:39,444
that's one of our favorites,

272
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:40,800
and Janae has learned a new trick.

273
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,633
(Janae smacking)

274
00:09:41,633 --> 00:09:44,278
Oh that's a good noise.
- Does she want a kiss?

275
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,231
(smacking)

276
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,498
- [Jeremy] She did it, but what oh--

277
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:49,213
- There it is.
- There is is.

278
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,103
(smacking)
(Janae shrieks)

279
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,386
(laughing)

280
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:55,219
- Yay, we're so proud of you, yay.

281
00:09:58,567 --> 00:09:59,714
♪ La la la la la ♪

282
00:09:59,714 --> 00:10:01,156

284
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,638
Good night, J House out.

285
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:10,023
- They said I'm gonna
have a sugar rush soon.

286
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:11,989
- We had a really rough morning.

287
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:12,822
(lively music)

288
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:13,655
- Is this a flower?

289
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,488
- [Jeremy] It will be.

290
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,413
- I've seen this in movies, so I'm trying.

291
00:10:16,413 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Kendra] Oh no, is it burnt to death?
