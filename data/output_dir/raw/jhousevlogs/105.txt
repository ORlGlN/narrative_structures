1
00:00:00,374 --> 00:00:02,167
(energetic music)

2
00:00:02,167 --> 00:00:04,630
My name is Queen Esile.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:08,392
All of my dating Mom is in this journal.

4
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:10,731
This is the recommended way
to dry your nails, right?

5
00:00:10,731 --> 00:00:13,802
So she's graduating to this toy.

6
00:00:13,802 --> 00:00:16,291
- [Jeremy] So you're writing
about your Disneyland trip?

7
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,124
(energetic music)

8
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:24,412
(kids yelling)

9
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:27,546
- [Caleb] I'm the king of the world.

10
00:00:27,546 --> 00:00:29,963
I'm the queen of the world!

11
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,573
(Laura singing)

12
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:44,609
(kids laughing)
Sprinkles!

13
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,442
So.

14
00:00:45,442 --> 00:00:47,999
My name is Queen Esile.

15
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:50,342
My name is King Peter.

16
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,585
Princess Elena!

17
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,496
Pepper.

18
00:00:53,496 --> 00:00:54,746
This is Pepper.

19
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,094
That's Alice.

20
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:00,469
- [Jeremy] So what are you guys writing?

21
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,661
We're writing people's names so that

22
00:01:03,661 --> 00:01:06,719
it's a thing that we do every year.

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,966
And every year, for my birthday party

24
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:10,716
we have 1,100 people.

25
00:01:12,188 --> 00:01:13,819
Is everybody here yet?

26
00:01:13,819 --> 00:01:14,667
- [Elise] Not yet!

27
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,476
Two hours more then they will all be here.

28
00:01:17,476 --> 00:01:18,851
Take a nap.

29
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:21,518
(Laura singing)

30
00:01:26,358 --> 00:01:29,108
(peaceful music)

31
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:33,078
(bin opening)

32
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:36,923
So I'm sharing a lesson in church

33
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,408
and there's an experience that I remember

34
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:40,143
in one of my journals that I wrote

35
00:01:40,143 --> 00:01:44,310
when I was about 19 years old,
and I can't find it anywhere

36
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:47,499
so I'm starting to dig through the boxes.

37
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:50,332
(energetic music)

38
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:54,562
So I've looked for over an hour.

39
00:01:54,562 --> 00:01:55,493
I went up and talked to Kendra

40
00:01:55,493 --> 00:01:59,626
and she was like, have you
prayed for help to find it?

41
00:01:59,626 --> 00:02:02,105
And I hadn't so I got the kids together

42
00:02:02,105 --> 00:02:04,048
and we knelt down and we prayed.

43
00:02:04,048 --> 00:02:07,293
I think that's an interesting
concept of how we look to God,

44
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,850
like I always want to
feel really independent,

45
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,556
like I'm gonna try to
do everything myself.

46
00:02:10,556 --> 00:02:11,840
I can get things done.

47
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,062
But then, there's also
that principle of humility,

48
00:02:15,062 --> 00:02:19,100
like I'm willing to turn to
a greater source for help.

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,366
I realize I have limitations,
I can't do everything.

50
00:02:21,366 --> 00:02:22,788
I don't know everything.

51
00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:25,041
And I think that that
is a powerful reminder

52
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:27,256
and that there can be divine help.

53
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:29,063
Even with something that can
seem really insignificant,

54
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:30,518
like finding a journal.

55
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:33,626
I have a sense it's gonna be in that box.

56
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:36,823
So it looks like you guys
turned your throne into a bed.

57
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,105
Yeah.

58
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,835
Today's a day of rest for us.

59
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,173
- [Jeremy] And you got a dress on!

60
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,838
(Caleb yelling)

61
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:47,005
(energetic music)
(kids running)

62
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:52,302
Ooh.

63
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,163
(box slamming down)

64
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:55,996
Yes.

65
00:02:55,996 --> 00:02:58,605
So here's my journal
from before that time.

66
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:02,355
This is a journal I
began on Christmas, 1994.

67
00:03:04,822 --> 00:03:05,655
Today was Christmas.

68
00:03:05,655 --> 00:03:06,794
It was awesome!

69
00:03:06,794 --> 00:03:09,748
I'm so glad that I kept a
journal during this time.

70
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:11,246
So this journal was right during the time

71
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:14,092
that my parents got
separated and then divorced

72
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,967
and I was bounced around
from different schools

73
00:03:15,967 --> 00:03:17,464
and different houses.

74
00:03:17,464 --> 00:03:20,320
It leads all the way up
through the third of December,

75
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,718
fifth of December, 2000.

76
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:22,602
So up through high school.

77
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:24,611
So this journal is from the time

78
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:28,193
I was about 12 years old until 18.

79
00:03:28,193 --> 00:03:29,383
That's a big deal.

80
00:03:29,383 --> 00:03:30,875
Poll question, do you keep a journal?

81
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,673
So the experience I'm
wanting to share in church

82
00:03:32,673 --> 00:03:35,577
is about a time where I felt
like God had really led us

83
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:38,741
to connect with someone
and to meet with someone,

84
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,753
and that it wasn't just a coincidence.

85
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:44,980
So this journal was just of
my senior year at high school.

86
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,479
I wanna go through and read these.

87
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,992
(majestic music)

88
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:50,612
You painting fingernails?

89
00:03:50,612 --> 00:03:51,767
Uh huh.

90
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:52,600
- [Jeremy] Oh, fun.

91
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,536
We have stickers to put them on.

92
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,997
(majestic music)

93
00:03:56,997 --> 00:03:58,076
- [Jeremy] What are you girls doing?

94
00:03:58,076 --> 00:04:00,079
Trying to get our nails to dry.

95
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,315
- [Jeremy] Drying 'em off?

96
00:04:01,315 --> 00:04:04,090
This is the recommended way
to dry your nails, right?

97
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,099
Kind of.

98
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,653
Looks like I painted them but I didn't.

99
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:08,692
- [Jeremy] Put little stickers on there?

100
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:11,525
(energetic music)

101
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,964
So Laura, why do you like
getting your fingernails painted?

102
00:04:16,964 --> 00:04:18,550
Because it's so fun!

103
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:22,718
(energetic music)
(Laura yelling)

104
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:25,200
(record scratching)

105
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,279
In the poll, do you love
to dance in the kitchen?

106
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,505
(Jeremy laughs)

107
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:31,816
So poll question, do you
love to dance in the kitchen?

108
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:32,649
Good question.

109
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:33,482
(hands clapping together)
Boom.

110
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,902
Laura reminds me of Miranda Sings,

111
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:37,291
with how she moves her body sometimes.

112
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:39,566
Are you kidding me?

113
00:04:39,566 --> 00:04:41,975
Well this morning, we are
packing up the baby jumper.

114
00:04:41,975 --> 00:04:43,960
Janae's not using it
anymore, she's not interested

115
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,516
in being stationary in a jumper.

116
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:47,307
She wants to be crawling
around and exploring

117
00:04:47,307 --> 00:04:50,310
and pulling herself up to stand
on everything that she can.

118
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,046
So, right now it's just taking up space,

119
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:54,746
which means it's time to
pack it up and put it away,

120
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:56,341
but it's kind of emotional doing that

121
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,297
because every single one
of my kids has used it.

122
00:04:59,297 --> 00:05:01,966
We bought it for Isaac when
he was about six months old,

123
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,917
and then we've packed
it away and stored it

124
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,143
between every child, and
so to pack it away again,

125
00:05:07,143 --> 00:05:09,800
it just kind of tugs at my heart strings.

126
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,454
I love watching my kids grow up,

127
00:05:11,454 --> 00:05:13,323
I love seeing the new things they do

128
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:15,053
but it's also always a little tender

129
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:19,308
and it gets me emotional
because I love my kids fiercely

130
00:05:19,308 --> 00:05:20,874
and while it's beautiful
to watch them grow,

131
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,640
it can also be a little
bit painful sometimes.

132
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,864
(soft music)

133
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:26,663
Well we discovered that
our niece, Elizabeth,

134
00:05:26,663 --> 00:05:28,364
can actually use this toy and so now

135
00:05:28,364 --> 00:05:30,155
I feel much better packing
it up because I know

136
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,689
it's going somewhere
special and purposeful.

137
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:34,156
Now I feel really good about it.

138
00:05:34,156 --> 00:05:36,994
Is this toy fun again now
that it's on the floor?

139
00:05:36,994 --> 00:05:39,673
So she's graduating to this toy.

140
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,853
I don't even remember
what these are called.

141
00:05:41,853 --> 00:05:43,086
She's gonna love it.

142
00:05:43,086 --> 00:05:44,321
Hey, 'Nae, what's this?

143
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,988
(playful music)

144
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,894
It's the perfect size for her!

145
00:05:50,894 --> 00:05:55,061
(playful music)
(baby making noises)

146
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:02,467
(toy playing music)

147
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:06,386
- [Jeremy] Are you dancin'?

148
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:09,722
(toy playing music)

149
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:12,230
(laughing)
She's dancin'!

150
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,397
She's dancin'!

151
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:18,820
(laughing)

152
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,095
She's serious about this one.

153
00:06:20,095 --> 00:06:23,194
So this toy is something
that we've given to our kids

154
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:25,478
usually when they're about a year old.

155
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:27,358
She's just already ready to be

156
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,280
standin' up and walking around.

157
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,381
I think it definitely is that she wants

158
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:32,044
to keep up with the big kids.

159
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:34,099
Nae Nae has the best dance moves ever.

160
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:37,933
She dances like Elvis
Presley but even better!

161
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,658
Shake those knees!

162
00:06:39,658 --> 00:06:41,751
So since I was digging through
and found all my journals

163
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,831
and my baby book, I wanted
to show it to my kids.

164
00:06:44,831 --> 00:06:47,211
That's me in the hospital.

165
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,044
(smooching)

166
00:06:48,044 --> 00:06:49,524
- [Isaac] That doesn't look like you.

167
00:06:49,524 --> 00:06:50,357
(baby crying)

168
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:51,190
(Jeremy laughing)

169
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,364
I got a little chunky.

170
00:06:52,364 --> 00:06:53,775
- [Kendra] There it is.

171
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:55,227
Look, that's my mum and dad.

172
00:06:55,227 --> 00:06:57,302
That looks like Papi Rod.

173
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,395
That is Papi Rod and Granny Joe.

174
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:00,745
- [Kendra] There's baby Jeremy!

175
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:01,578
Hey, you guys, look.

176
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:04,021
Those are my hand prints right there.

177
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,565
Look how much bigger my hand is now.

178
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:06,398
Whoa.

179
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:07,746
Who's that?

180
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:08,855
That's Julie!

181
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:09,809
And me!

182
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:12,250
All of the pictures of me
were pretty not smiley,

183
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,083
I was just like.

184
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:13,916
Really?

185
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,091
Julie is older than you?

186
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:16,345
Yeah, Julie's my older sister.

187
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:17,178
Oh look!

188
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,020
There's one of me smiling.

189
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,262
'Kay, so now I'm getting
a little bit older here.

190
00:07:20,262 --> 00:07:21,753
- [Kendra] I always loved this one.

191
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:24,753
So Jeremy was very blond as a child.

192
00:07:25,685 --> 00:07:28,434
So we often get asked how
Laura has her blonde hair.

193
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,538
It's because Jeremy was
really blond as a kid.

194
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:32,488
I liked to play with hammers.

195
00:07:32,488 --> 00:07:33,387
What were you doing with the hammers?

196
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:35,153
And I liked to be in cars and fix things

197
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,822
when I was little, just like you, Cubby.

198
00:07:37,822 --> 00:07:39,905
I liked to play dress-up.

199
00:07:41,603 --> 00:07:44,958
I loved football even as a little kid.

200
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,668
With the football hat!

201
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:49,265
Why do they show you in
the bath all the time?

202
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:50,757
My mom wanted to show a
picture of what it was like

203
00:07:50,757 --> 00:07:53,677
when my body was covered in chicken pox.

204
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:56,031
- [Isaac] You got chicken pox
when you were four years old?

205
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,195
Four months old.

206
00:07:57,195 --> 00:08:01,028
This is when I moved to
live at the mud house.

207
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:05,668
And then in high school I
wrote even more, in here.

208
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:09,301
And then when I lived
in Canada for two years,

209
00:08:09,301 --> 00:08:11,516
I wrote about that.

210
00:08:11,516 --> 00:08:14,189
When I went to college and I met Mom

211
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:17,907
and all of my dating
Mom is in this journal.

212
00:08:17,907 --> 00:08:18,950
- [Isaac] Oh, I wanna read--

213
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,415
I wanna do the same thing

214
00:08:20,415 --> 00:08:22,852
but where do I get all the paper?

215
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:24,174
We could get you a journal.

216
00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:25,366
Woo!
Dude, you have a journal.

217
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,607
- [Jeremy] So last Christmas, Granny Joe

218
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,774
got you guys all journals.

219
00:08:30,728 --> 00:08:31,889
I got so much!
So you have one.

220
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:32,722
You just need to start writing in 'em.

221
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:33,554
Is this one mine?

222
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:34,387
Yup!

223
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:35,221
That's yours.

224
00:08:35,221 --> 00:08:36,452
In my family growing
up, we had a tradition

225
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:37,962
on Sunday evenings where
we would all sit down

226
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:39,268
and write in our journals together.

227
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,581
It was like family journal time.

228
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:42,913
In other news, I got new earrings.

229
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:43,746
Check these out!

230
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:45,879
Apparently they're called ear crawlers.

231
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,862
- [Jeremy] I think it looks good.

232
00:08:46,862 --> 00:08:47,919
I like 'em!

233
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,083
And it goes with the choker,
at least I think it does,

234
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:51,138
'cause when I wear a choker I never know

235
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:53,165
what earrings to wear so.

236
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,665
Feeling excited in my new earrings.

237
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,702
One of the things that really drew me

238
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,703
to YouTube and vlogging is
that it is a lot like a journal

239
00:09:00,703 --> 00:09:01,536
and I love that we can go back--

240
00:09:01,536 --> 00:09:02,369
Dad, this is my eraser.

241
00:09:02,369 --> 00:09:03,454
And watch stuff that happened.

242
00:09:03,454 --> 00:09:05,366
Is that your eraser?

243
00:09:05,366 --> 00:09:06,454
You writin' in your journal?

244
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:07,287
- [Laura] Yeah.

245
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:08,254
How about you tell me what to say

246
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,143
and I'll write it down for you, okay?

247
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,121
Alright, what do you wanna put?

248
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:12,954
Uh, I love you, Dad.

249
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:15,712
Right here.

250
00:09:15,712 --> 00:09:17,396
[High-Pitched Voice] Love you, Dad.

251
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:20,063
(playful music)

252
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:25,839
(fridge running)

253
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:30,334
Our fridge is making a concerning noise.

254
00:09:30,334 --> 00:09:35,141
I am seven years old,
and I am seeing, seeing,

255
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,641
singing in a choir and I got a group solo.

256
00:09:40,448 --> 00:09:41,556
I am happy.

257
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:42,389
Caleb.

258
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,056
This is when, this is
about when I was five.

259
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:50,229
My Dad told me about when he was

260
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:53,590
four months old to two years old.

261
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,993
- [Jeremy] You know, one of
the things with a journal

262
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:57,682
is you can put in the
journal stuff that happened,

263
00:09:57,682 --> 00:09:59,935
but it's also important
to write your feelings.

264
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:02,772
How are you feeling about
things in your life.

265
00:10:02,772 --> 00:10:04,155
No, I don't like that.

266
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:04,988
Okay.

267
00:10:04,988 --> 00:10:07,571
(joyful music)

268
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:10,999
Our kids are talking to
Granny Joe on the phone.

269
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,247
Uh huh.

270
00:10:12,247 --> 00:10:13,612
(voice speaking through telephone)

271
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,216
In like a singing choir.

272
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,683
- [Jeremy] It's Papi Keith!

273
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:19,962
Hi, Papi Keith!

274
00:10:19,962 --> 00:10:21,297
- [Jeremy] So, tell us
what's in your journal, bud.

275
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:24,047
I had no idea, we opened a box.

276
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,905
They told me we are going to Disneyland.

277
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,189
I freaked out.

278
00:10:29,189 --> 00:10:30,588
We went on a plane.

279
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,897
On the plane, we watched
movies and ate some food.

280
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:34,730
We had fun.

281
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,684
It was fun at Disneyland.

282
00:10:36,684 --> 00:10:39,017
We did rides and ate treats.

283
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:41,843
It was fun.

284
00:10:41,843 --> 00:10:43,891
- [Jeremy] So you're writing
about your Disneyland trip?

285
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,808
We had a lots of fun.

286
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:49,018
- [Jeremy] That's awesome, buddy!

287
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:49,851
Yep.

288
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:51,138
Abra cadabra!

289
00:10:51,138 --> 00:10:52,388
Abra cadabra!

290
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:54,628
Huzza pu--

291
00:10:54,628 --> 00:10:55,901
Hocus pocus.

292
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:57,853
Hocus pocus!

293
00:10:57,853 --> 00:10:59,600
What is your car?

294
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,024
- [Jeremy] I love you girls.

295
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:02,079
- [Girls] I love you too.

296
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,912
- [Jeremy] Have a good night, okay?

297
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,845
'Kay, good night.

298
00:11:03,845 --> 00:11:04,694
J House out.

299
00:11:04,694 --> 00:11:05,527
♪ Good night ♪

300
00:11:05,527 --> 00:11:07,429
♪ J House out ♪

301
00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:08,843
♪ J House ♪

302
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:09,676
Out.

303
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:11,989
So my sister-in-law Michelle just came up

304
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:14,527
with the most genius
thing for bike riding.

305
00:11:14,527 --> 00:11:16,297
Dad, sometimes I call you Jeremy

306
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,741
and sometimes I call Mom Kendra.

307
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:19,949
Snuggle season.

308
00:11:19,949 --> 00:11:20,782
(taco crunching)

309
00:11:20,782 --> 00:11:21,615
- [Jeremy] Crunchy.

310
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,727
- [Kid] I saw you in the first place!

311
00:11:23,727 --> 00:11:25,882
So Nae Nae is doing the cutest thing.

312
00:11:25,882 --> 00:11:27,075
There's a new deli.

313
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:29,017
And I got a Big Nasty.

314
00:11:29,017 --> 00:00:00,000
(energetic music)
