1
00:00:00,843 --> 00:00:01,676
(whack)

2
00:00:01,676 --> 00:00:02,509
(Jeremy laughs)

3
00:00:02,509 --> 00:00:04,392
(bright music)

4
00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:06,857
- I found our first geocache.

5
00:00:06,857 --> 00:00:09,481
(blender whirring)

6
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:11,731
(laughing)

7
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:16,760
- So while we were in Utah,

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,812
filming with Studio C,

9
00:00:17,812 --> 00:00:21,078
the one billion view celebration,

10
00:00:21,078 --> 00:00:23,064
we lost our camera.

11
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,271
It's so devastating.

12
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,872
We had so much fun

13
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:28,137
and we filmed a bunch of stuff,

14
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:30,220
and that footage is gone.

15
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,575
For now, I'm still hoping
the camera shows up

16
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,949
or turns up, or somehow is found.

17
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,245
Anyway, what happened was Kendra and I

18
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:39,647
were doing this peanut
butter hair challenge.

19
00:00:39,647 --> 00:00:40,516
- And go!

20
00:00:40,516 --> 00:00:41,433
- [All] Oh!

21
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:46,242
(laughing)

22
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,567
- Oh looking good, looking good.

23
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,476
- [Man] This is brilliant.

24
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:52,309
- I don't know.

25
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,254
- [Man] Alright alright,
working your way across.

26
00:00:54,254 --> 00:00:55,087
And it's time for you to give us

27
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:56,495
your one answer,

28
00:00:56,495 --> 00:00:57,482
- What is it guys?
- What is your answer?

29
00:00:57,482 --> 00:00:59,254
- Okay, we think it's cornrows.

30
00:00:59,254 --> 00:01:01,104
- [All] Yeah.
(bell dings)

31
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:01,937
- You got it!

32
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,051
(cheering and clapping)

33
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,643
- So after the challenge, our hands were

34
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:05,476
all covered in peanut butter,

35
00:01:05,476 --> 00:01:06,612
we were all messy,

36
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:08,555
and I took my camera from someone

37
00:01:08,555 --> 00:01:09,420
who was filming for me

38
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,889
and I was gonna go and change,

39
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,738
and I set the camera down on a table.

40
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:14,855
That wasn't the smartest thing.

41
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:16,881
I should've put it in
my bag or in my stuff,

42
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,721
but I just set it down in this table

43
00:01:18,721 --> 00:01:20,775
in the middle of all the chaos

44
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:23,328
and I didn't find it after that.

45
00:01:23,328 --> 00:01:24,882
So it's gone.

46
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:26,034
(mishap music)

47
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:27,126
(groans)

48
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:29,862
Luckily though, Studio C filmed

49
00:01:29,862 --> 00:01:31,376
all of what we did with the challenge,

50
00:01:31,376 --> 00:01:32,776
so you can go and watch that video.

51
00:01:32,776 --> 00:01:34,394
I'll iCard it right here.

52
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,860
Okay so make sure to go
over to Studio C's video

53
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,901
and give some J House
love in the comments.

54
00:01:38,901 --> 00:01:40,585
It was a tight competition.

55
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,465
We had so much fun with the
YouTubers that were there,

56
00:01:42,465 --> 00:01:45,793
and I've been a huge fan
of Studio C for awhile,

57
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:47,242
and so getting to just hang out with them

58
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,452
and have a fun time, it was amazing.

59
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,931
Also, my dad was here
filming the adventures

60
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:53,787
of the kids, and they
did do some cool stuff.

61
00:01:53,787 --> 00:01:56,657
- I found our first geocache,

62
00:01:56,657 --> 00:01:58,746
and we're gonna go find some more.

63
00:01:58,746 --> 00:02:02,913
(rustling bush)
(adventure music)

64
00:02:04,883 --> 00:02:06,783
- I found it.

65
00:02:06,783 --> 00:02:07,697
- Cool.

66
00:02:07,697 --> 00:02:08,901
Come here.

67
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,402
- I got the log.

68
00:02:10,402 --> 00:02:11,427
- Let us know in the poll

69
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:13,741
if you have done geocaching.

70
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:15,315
The kids did a lot of other fun stuff too.

71
00:02:15,315 --> 00:02:17,920
They went bowling, they baked cookies,

72
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,138
they played at their cousins' house.

73
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:22,805
(uptempo music)

74
00:02:25,273 --> 00:02:27,630
(sped up talking)

75
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:30,547
(sped up cheering)

76
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,752
- Go go!

77
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:36,722
(pins knocking)

78
00:02:36,722 --> 00:02:37,555
Yay!

79
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:45,781
(cheering)

80
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,325
- I got 'em all.

81
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:50,242
(enchanting music)

82
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:04,230
(egg knocking)

83
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,147
(blender whirring)

84
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:10,139
- Don't worry, I washed my hands.

85
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:12,389

94
00:03:36,734 --> 00:03:37,567
- After we lost our camera,

95
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,493
we took some footage on our phone.

96
00:03:40,493 --> 00:03:41,596
Nae Nae.

97
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,298
(Janae cooing)

98
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:44,547
- Hi.
- Hi.

99
00:03:44,547 --> 00:03:47,297
(dramatic music)

100
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,140
- And after we got home,

101
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,916
we were able to say hi to our kids

102
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:00,795
and show them the video from Studio C.

103
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:04,036
- It's Caleb.
(gentle music)

104
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:05,277
My buddy.

105
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:06,610
Oh I missed you.

106
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:10,527
My buddy.

107
00:04:10,527 --> 00:04:11,747
How are you?

108
00:04:11,747 --> 00:04:13,709
I missed you, oh.

109
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,096
Do you know who else missed you?

110
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,418
This one.

111
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,653
This one right here.

112
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:21,002
Look, it's your Lise.

113
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:21,834
(whack)

114
00:04:21,834 --> 00:04:23,936
(laughing)

115
00:04:23,936 --> 00:04:25,957
- [Jared] Aww, let me see.

116
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:27,857
- [Man On TV] Very detailed,

117
00:04:27,857 --> 00:04:30,384
this is brilliant, this is brilliant.

118
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:31,217
- I don't know.

119
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,653
- Anyway, I'm so sorry
this video's shorter

120
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:34,458
and that we lost that footage.

121
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,889
We'll have a normal vlog up for you

122
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:37,985
later this week.

123
00:04:37,985 --> 00:04:38,977
J House out.

124
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:40,753
Do they know where we're going.

125
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:41,753
(jazzy music)

126
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:43,219
- We'll be back soon.
- We'll be back soon.

127
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:45,091
- It's really kind of funny.

128
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:45,924
- Laura!

129
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:48,628
- Love you.

130
00:04:48,628 --> 00:04:49,787
- [Kendra] Bye guys.

131
00:04:49,787 --> 00:04:51,905
So we're at this crazy
awesome house for a party,

132
00:04:51,905 --> 00:00:00,000
and they said we can explore.
