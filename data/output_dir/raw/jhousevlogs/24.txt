1
00:00:00,811 --> 00:00:04,061
- Cha cha cha with a cherry on the top.

2
00:00:06,449 --> 00:00:08,782
(screaming)

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,640
- It was my favorite birthday party ever.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,557
(fast-paced music)

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,620
- So we are having a big,
triple birthday party today

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:25,900
at Chuck E. Cheese.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,780
Our kids celebrated most
their birthdays when we were

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,620
traveling in San Diego but
they still wanted to have a

9
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:30,850
moment to play with their friends.

10
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:32,840
And so we decided to keep things simple

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,400
and just do one big party.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,233
This is gonna be fun.

13
00:00:35,233 --> 00:00:36,210
I don't think our kids have ever been

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,668
to Chuck E. Cheese before.

15
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:39,487
Alright, head in.

16
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:41,987
(light music)

17
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:46,984
- Unlimited games okay.

18
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:50,813
The birthday kids are gonna
get one of these things

19
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:51,815
on their wrists.

20
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:54,635
And then everybody else
is gonna get one of the

21
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:57,460
unlimited cards.

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,799
Do not lose your card.

23
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,740
(playful music)

24
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,489
- [Kendra] You got it, good job Britney.

25
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,990
Scan it, she's riding the motorcyle.

26
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,121
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:16,213 --> 00:01:17,046
Whoa!

28
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:21,030
(playful music)

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,928
You made it in the jackpot?

30
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:30,180
- Yeah the jackpot,
and I got all of these.

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,230
- [Kendra] Good work.

32
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,106
This is the real reason we
came to Chuck E. Cheese.

33
00:01:38,106 --> 00:01:40,179
- I'm in the Hall of Fame, I
have a high record right now.

34
00:01:40,179 --> 00:01:42,846
(playful music)

35
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,873
I'm gotta try to beat the high score.

36
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,540
(frantic music)

37
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,054
No!

38
00:02:00,054 --> 00:02:02,180
I got it but it went in afterwards.

39
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:06,458
I broke the record but I
was short in it coming in.

40
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,301
I finally broke the high score.

41
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:12,219
(video game music)

42
00:02:19,493 --> 00:02:21,216
- [Dad] Get him!

43
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:24,133
(video game music)

44
00:02:30,644 --> 00:02:34,040
- [Kendra] Do you keep getting
stuck in that seatbelt?

45
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,960
Let's get you out of there.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,210
- Let's go eat pizza.

47
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,680
Alright, we're gathering
together for the pizza time.

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,002
Laura, what do you have to drink?

49
00:02:41,002 --> 00:02:42,002
- Root Beer.

50
00:02:46,605 --> 00:02:51,258
- (room chanting) Chuck E. Cheese.

51
00:02:51,258 --> 00:02:53,508
(cheering)

52
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,483
(upbeat music)

53
00:03:07,978 --> 00:03:10,895
("Happy Birthday")

54
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,650
- Cha cha cha with a cherry on the top.

55
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,830
- [Jeremy] Alright, Elise.

56
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,840
- So instead of doing a big birthday cake

57
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,030
I let the kids choose
different flavors of cupcakes.

58
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,730
They chose strawberry,
lemon, Funfetti and chocolate

59
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,940
cupcakes, which one would
you choose if you were here?

60
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,250
Let us know in the poll.

61
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,570
Laura chose a strawberry cupcake.

62
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,564
Why'd you choose strawberry?

63
00:03:35,564 --> 00:03:37,231
- Because it's pink.

64
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:41,270
(fast-paced music)

65
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,520
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness.

66
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,583
- Thank you!

67
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:55,265
I love it.

68
00:03:56,895 --> 00:03:57,728
Awww!

69
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:00,060
Thank you.

70
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,944
- [Kendra] Oh my goodness
Elisey, it makes princess cakes.

71
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:06,861
- Lego set!

72
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:11,749
- [Kendra] Awesome!

73
00:04:11,749 --> 00:04:12,749
- Thank you.

74
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:19,648
Dude, thank you.

75
00:04:23,872 --> 00:04:25,453
- Screams.

76
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:27,729
- [Kendra] It's so pretty.

77
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:29,729
This one's from Britney.

78
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:32,915
- It's a microphone!

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,477
A real one?

80
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:37,340
Thank you.

81
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,990
- [Kendra] It's a light-up purse?

82
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:44,243
- [Ashlyn] And you can
also change the modes.

83
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:47,280
- Thank you so much Ashlyn.

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,870
- [Kendra] It is a light-up purse.

85
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,703
- What!

86
00:04:52,349 --> 00:04:53,182
- Look on the back.

87
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,511
It has electronic scoreboard.

88
00:04:54,511 --> 00:04:57,344
- Thank you, thank you, thank you!

89
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,513
- [Jeremy] Caleb, how's your cupcake?

90
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,346
- Look.

91
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:08,080
- [Jeremy] Whoa.

92
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,148
How's the lemon cupcake?

93
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:10,981
- Yummy.

94
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,502
(upbeat music)

95
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,300
- [Kendra] That is an awesome picture.

96
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,200
- I just took a picture of myself.

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,950
- [Kendra] This is like a funny house one.

98
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:22,980
Do another one.

99
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,730
And then it prints.

100
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,563
Let's see it.

101
00:05:31,643 --> 00:05:33,197
Looks awesome.

102
00:05:33,197 --> 00:05:35,447
(giggling)

103
00:05:37,548 --> 00:05:40,108
- [Jeremy] You guys got a great picture.

104
00:05:40,108 --> 00:05:42,608
(light music)

105
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,243
Good shot!

106
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,463
Nice.

107
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:53,962
Oh almost.

108
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,980
- It's so fun to see
the kids enjoying this

109
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,030
with all of their friends.

110
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,760
They each only invited a few friends

111
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,700
but when you put that all
together it makes for a big group.

112
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,660
So the kids have a
friendly competition going,

113
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,500
who's going to get the most
tickets by the end of the party.

114
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:12,129
(yelling)

115
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,165
(playful music)

116
00:06:18,967 --> 00:06:20,867
- Look what I got from beating Garret.

117
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:23,983
- [Jeremy] Good job.

118
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,893
(whimsical music)

119
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,420
- So when kids come
here for their birthday

120
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,930
they let them use the
ticket blaster to try to get

121
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,748
as many tickets as possible.

122
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:41,795
- I'm so excited.

123
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,712
- [Jeremy] Alright, go!

124
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,670
Three, two, one.

125
00:06:53,903 --> 00:06:54,736
How many did you get Elise?

126
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:55,957
- 140!

127
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,093
- [Jeremy] 140 tickets.

128
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,170
- [Caleb] Go Laura!

129
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,003
Come on Laura.

130
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,913
- [Jeremy] How are you
feeling about it, Laura?

131
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:03,133
- I'm scared.

132
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:03,966
- She's feeling a little bit nervous.

133
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,460
But because Laura didn't wanna do it

134
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,160
she got a little nervous,
Isaac is gonna go for her.

135
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,560
Isaac, the bigger ones are worth more.

136
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:14,725
(laughing)

137
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,620
Okay, put it in your pocket.

138
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,801
Which one was it?

139
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:21,962
- 500.

140
00:07:21,962 --> 00:07:23,440
- [Jeremy] You got a 500 one?

141
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,210
- Caleb doesn't want his
turn in the ticket blaster

142
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:26,540
so Jeremy's doing it.

143
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,410
And he's taking it seriously.

144
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,300
The adult in the ticket blaster.

145
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,970
Times up.

146
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,930
Let's see how he did.

147
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,890
- It was a lot harder than I expected.

148
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,360
I like still have
tickets down in my pants.

149
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,836
Caleb, I got the 500 one.

150
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:43,669
- Yay!

151
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,895
- [Jeremy] They're counting them up.

152
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:48,395
- You caught 746 tickets.

153
00:07:48,395 --> 00:07:49,645
- [Jeremy] 746!

154
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,400
(dance music)

155
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:08,167
- Janae does not know what
to do with Chuck E. Cheese.

156
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:10,750
- [Jeremy] She's not
quite sure about that.

157
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,463
- Can you say hi?

158
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:13,296
Hi!

159
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,100
- [Jeremy] She's not feeling it.

160
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,350
- Look at her eyeing him.

161
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,450
- She's still a little nervous.

162
00:08:22,737 --> 00:08:24,450
Yeah, yeah!

163
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,412
Good job.

164
00:08:26,412 --> 00:08:28,310
Good job.

165
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,710
She's getting a little
bit more brave each time.

166
00:08:31,715 --> 00:08:32,548
Hey!

167
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:34,389
Yeah!

168
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,111
- I took a picture with all my friends.

169
00:08:37,111 --> 00:08:38,842
- [Jeremy] How fun.

170
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:41,342
(salsa music)

171
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,770
- The kids are done playing the games

172
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,160
and now we're gonna count up the tickets

173
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,160
and pick what their prizes will be.

174
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:56,597
(salsa music)

175
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,530
- [Kendra] Isaac, you're still feeding it?

176
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,390
- I'm at 119.

177
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:06,204
- He still has this much more.

178
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,220
- [Kendra] Is it working Caleb?

179
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,136
- Yup, I'm at 24, but I
have 750 more of these

180
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,636
not counting this.

181
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,734
- [Jeremy] You have almost 300 tickets.

182
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:23,401
(frantic music)

183
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,260
- [Jeremy] Laura, what do you wanna get?

184
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,930
- A lollipop.

185
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,920
- A lollipop?

186
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,930
So this is our first
time at Chuck E. Cheese.

187
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:37,560
I think we've only done a place like this

188
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,050
one other time so it's novel for our kids.

189
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,651
- I want that football.

190
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:42,636
- [Jeremy] The football?

191
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:44,514
- Yup, and then I'm
gonna get a few candies.

192
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:48,090
Air heads, I would like one skittles,

193
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:50,554
I would like one gummy ring.

194
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:51,620
- [Cashier] Happy birthday!

195
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,510
- Yay that is awesome!

196
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,290
- Well this place got
really busy and so I'm happy

197
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,120
that we're heading home.

198
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,570
It was a wonderful night.

199
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,540
- We survived.

200
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,770
- It was my favorite birthday party ever.

201
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,603
Good night.

202
00:10:08,603 --> 00:10:09,436
J House out.

203
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,620
- Okay I'm ready to take these things out

204
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,030
and see what happened to my head.

205
00:10:16,030 --> 00:00:00,000
Caleb, whatcha doing?
