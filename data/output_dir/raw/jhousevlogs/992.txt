00:00:00,339 --> 00:00:02,184
- [Narrator] Once upon a time

2
00:00:02,184 --> 00:00:04,577
on a YouTube channel not too far away,

3
00:00:04,577 --> 00:00:07,645
there lived a tired young mother
who worked through her day

4
00:00:07,645 --> 00:00:09,473
with barely a smile.

5
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:13,726
One night she sat back
in exhaustion and sighed.

6
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:15,709
When what to her wondering eyes did appear

7
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,616
but her fairy godmother.

8
00:00:17,616 --> 00:00:20,954
With the tap of a wand
and a twirl of it too

9
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:25,832
her Disney side was revealed
and her happiness grew.

10
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:26,749
She smiled.

11
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,763
She danced.

12
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:30,689
She found joy everywhere.

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,732
(leaves rustling)

14
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:34,982
(laughter)

15
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,340
(squealing)

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,246
She laughed and she sang.

17
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:43,125
The magic of life, it was there.

18
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,617
And they lived happily ever after.

19
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:00,000
The end.
