1
00:00:05,895 --> 00:00:07,979
- Alright, so I don't know if any of you

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:10,896
have ever had this experience, but,

3
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,924
it sometimes feels like, when
you're trying to do something

4
00:00:13,924 --> 00:00:15,582
that's like, a family tradition,

5
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,968
and it's like a happy memory,

6
00:00:17,968 --> 00:00:21,814
and you're getting ready to
go, and everyone's screaming,

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:24,478
and everyone's fighting, and
somebody's throwing a tantrum

8
00:00:24,478 --> 00:00:27,752
and nobody can find two
shoes for the life of them,

9
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:29,918
and you're running behind, and,

10
00:00:29,918 --> 00:00:32,884
then the parents start
like, snipping at eachother,

11
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:34,713
and then you're all packed up in the car

12
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:36,599
then you forget something,
and you run back up,

13
00:00:36,599 --> 00:00:37,499
and then you actually

14
00:00:37,499 --> 00:00:39,043
- I need to go back and get my sunglasses

15
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:39,937
(laughs)

16
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:40,901
I'm serious, I'm actually

17
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,752
- Then you actually
drive away and of course

18
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,986
you have to go back and
get something inevitably.

19
00:00:44,986 --> 00:00:46,601
- Why does that happen every time?

20
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,474
- Your entire car is
like, loaded to the brim.

21
00:00:49,474 --> 00:00:52,766
Somebody's whining in
the back about something.

22
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:55,018
- I need my other book.

23
00:00:55,018 --> 00:00:57,396
- [Kendra] You need a different book?

24
00:00:57,396 --> 00:01:00,144
- [Son] No, I need my other baby.

25
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,154
(sigh)

26
00:01:01,154 --> 00:01:02,524
- I wish we were faking all of this.

27
00:01:02,524 --> 00:01:03,667
(laughs)

28
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:06,706
- Ya that never happens to us either.

29
00:01:06,706 --> 00:01:10,039
(nutcracker theme song)

30
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:17,275
- So this is the
Christmas tree ranch farm.

31
00:01:17,275 --> 00:01:19,236
Check out the cute barn!

32
00:01:19,236 --> 00:01:20,206
- [Dad] It's a fun place.

33
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:21,621
Ya, I think this is our fourth year

34
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:23,033
to come here to get our Christmas tree.

35
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,589
- So you come and you cut down your own,

36
00:01:24,589 --> 00:01:26,162
and you go on a little sleigh ride,

37
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,757
and you drink some hot chocolate,

38
00:01:27,757 --> 00:01:29,343
and you spill the hot
chocolate on yourself,

39
00:01:29,343 --> 00:01:30,580
and your kids cry.

40
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,768
It's really just magical.

41
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:35,425
- We have enough negativity
in today's vlog, Kendra.

42
00:01:35,425 --> 00:01:39,008
(voices in the background)

43
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:41,729
- [Dad] Who's that?

44
00:01:45,464 --> 00:01:46,881
We can go say hi.

45
00:01:47,835 --> 00:01:49,678
- [Santa Claus] Merry Christmas.

46
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:52,319
Hi, how are you doing?

47
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,069
(jingling bells)

48
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,437
- Is her eyes covered?

49
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:00,422
- [Dad] Ya (laughs).

50
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:01,631
Shes' totally covered.

51
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:03,486
There she is!

52
00:02:03,486 --> 00:02:06,792
I think she was sleeping under there.

53
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:08,533
You drinkin' hot chocolate?

54
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,792
- Ya.

55
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:12,793
(background voices)

56
00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,986
(singing "Dashing Through the Snow")

57
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,787
- That one!

58
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:32,742
- [Kendra] Oh!

59
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:33,575
She likes that one!

60
00:02:33,575 --> 00:02:34,856
- [Dad] We'll take it!

61
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:35,689
- [Daughter] Ya!

62
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,886
- [Dad] Do you think
it'll fit in our house?

63
00:02:37,886 --> 00:02:39,469
Where do we put it?

64
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:45,665
- This one!

65
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:46,795
- [Dad] Is that one just right?

66
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,628
- Ya!

67
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:48,980
- [Dad] Do you love it?

68
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,230
- I don't know!

69
00:02:51,283 --> 00:02:52,362
This one!

70
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,195
- [Dad] That one?

71
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:54,028
- Ya.

72
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:54,861
- [Dad] Why do you like that one?

73
00:02:54,861 --> 00:02:55,694
- This one.

74
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:56,527
- [Dad] This one?

75
00:02:56,527 --> 00:02:57,360
- No, that one!

76
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,327
- [Dad] There's so many choices,
which one should we get?

77
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:01,632
Alright, we've narrowed
it down to two trees.

78
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:03,246
It's either gonna be this one,

79
00:03:03,246 --> 00:03:05,016
or that one over there.

80
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:05,957
- [Kendra] Hey guys, which one?

81
00:03:05,957 --> 00:03:07,349
Let's let the kids vote!

82
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,016
- [Dad] Laura, what's your vote?

83
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:09,954
- That one!

84
00:03:09,954 --> 00:03:10,787
- [Dad] Oh no!

85
00:03:10,787 --> 00:03:13,048
It's a tie, Mom, you're the tie breaker.

86
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:13,881
- [Daughter] That one!

87
00:03:13,881 --> 00:03:14,867
- That was convenient.

88
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,662
- Dad, you can be the tie breaker.

89
00:03:16,662 --> 00:03:17,678
(sawing)

90
00:03:17,678 --> 00:03:19,586
- [Kendra] There he is, manly man!

91
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,339
Cutting down the Christmas
tree for his fam.

92
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,950
("Oh Christmas Tree")

93
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,935
- [Dad] You picked one?

94
00:03:24,935 --> 00:03:25,768
- We're going with shorty.

95
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:26,601
- We're debating, ya!

96
00:03:26,601 --> 00:03:28,351
- [Dad] Shorty McGee.

97
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,663
- Took us a while, but we
found a good Christmas tree.

98
00:03:43,663 --> 00:03:46,197
What should we name it guys?

99
00:03:46,197 --> 00:03:47,149
Leaf?

100
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:49,241
- Ya, so our Christmas
tree's name is Leaf.

101
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:51,081
That was Elyse's idea.

102
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:55,248
(singing "Dashing Through the Snow")

103
00:04:11,155 --> 00:04:13,302
- So we're heading home
from our family outing,

104
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:15,654
and I'm kind of reflecting
on the experience

105
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:16,999
in my mind, and,

106
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,839
it was not a picture perfect outing,

107
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,517
but there were beautiful moments,

108
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,698
and that's something that
I've been trying to learn

109
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:26,050
in motherhood, is that
it's not gonna be perfect,

110
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,072
but just because it's not perfect,

111
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:29,516
doesn't mean that there's
not magical moments in there,

112
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:31,478
and today the magical
moment that's gonna like,

113
00:04:31,478 --> 00:04:33,063
live on in my mind,

114
00:04:33,063 --> 00:04:36,116
is the singing the christmas
carols on the sleigh ride.

115
00:04:36,116 --> 00:04:37,288
Like, that's beautiful,

116
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,668
like that's what wonderful
family memories are made of.

117
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:43,668
Look for the joy 'cause
the joys in the moments.

118
00:04:44,910 --> 00:00:00,000
