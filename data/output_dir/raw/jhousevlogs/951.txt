1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,794
- So after the kids go to bed tonight,

2
00:00:01,794 --> 00:00:02,918
Jeremy and I are going to be doing

3
00:00:02,918 --> 00:00:04,444
some serious resolution talk,

4
00:00:04,444 --> 00:00:05,485
but before they go to bed

5
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:08,864
I want you guys to hear
their New Year's resolutions.

6
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:13,031
(bright orchestral music)

7
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:37,618
- [Kendra] What is your
New Year's resolution?

8
00:00:38,652 --> 00:00:41,335
- [Kendra] You want to
go motorcycle racing?

9
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:45,502
Alright, what else do you
want to learn this year?

10
00:00:57,588 --> 00:00:59,307
(Kendra Laughs)

11
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:00,240
- [Kendra] Alright Miss Elise,

12
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,323
what are your New Year's resolutions?

13
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,614
- I want to go swimming without,

14
00:01:09,398 --> 00:01:12,367
swimming without those things.

15
00:01:12,367 --> 00:01:13,379
- [Kendra] The floaties?

16
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:14,901
- Yeah, floaties.

17
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:16,785
- [Kendra] Yeah? What
else do you want to learn?

18
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:21,142
- I want to learn to have a dog.

19
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:22,647
(Kendra laughs)

20
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:25,032
- To take care of a dog.

21
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:26,378
- [Kendra] Alright Isaac,

22
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,461
what are your New Year's resolutions?

23
00:01:30,544 --> 00:01:33,199
- Riding a bike without training wheels,

24
00:01:33,199 --> 00:01:35,631
swimming without floaty.

25
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:38,706
I want to learn how to do

26
00:01:38,706 --> 00:01:43,319
flag football, basketball, and gymnastics.

27
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,281
And to do stuff more nicely.

28
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,960
I want to be more honest

29
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,943
and not complain when other people

30
00:01:51,943 --> 00:01:54,126
get do funner stuff than me.

31
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:54,959
- [Kendra] Wow.

32
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,141
Those are some really good
New Year's resolutions.

33
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,941
So, since it's January fourth

34
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:00,944
this is not a New Year's resolution,

35
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,781
but I do appreciate this time of year.

36
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:06,084
Like thinking about kind of
where we're at with our life,

37
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,187
where we want to be at
this time next year.

38
00:02:08,187 --> 00:02:10,778
What we, like, it's a good
time to kind of reevaluate

39
00:02:10,779 --> 00:02:12,420
and be deliberate about who we are

40
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,389
and who we want to be,

41
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,348
and what it's gonna take to get there.

42
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:17,849
But, I really, I honestly struggle.

43
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:19,627
I'm a perfectionist

44
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:21,794
and I struggle with taking

45
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:26,088
small steps towards who I want to be.

46
00:02:26,088 --> 00:02:27,254
I see the picture.

47
00:02:27,254 --> 00:02:29,837
And I see so clearly in my mind,

48
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:34,128
the mother and the wife and
the woman that I want to be

49
00:02:34,128 --> 00:02:35,790
and I just feel like trying to get there

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,207
is sometimes walking through quicksand.

51
00:02:37,207 --> 00:02:38,950
And I start thinking about

52
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,766
like ooh, what should my
New Year's resolutions be?

53
00:02:40,766 --> 00:02:42,424
And immediately my brain starts going,

54
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:44,334
"ooh, I want to run a marathon,

55
00:02:44,334 --> 00:02:45,167
I want to decorate my house,

56
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,877
I want to be the best homeschool
mom I can possibly be.

57
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:49,626
I'm gonna be so nice to all of my children

58
00:02:49,626 --> 00:02:50,875
and I'm going to be the best wife ever.

59
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:51,708
And we're gonna start clean eating,

60
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,524
and I'm going to do 50 weeks
of organization for my house,

61
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:54,436
and were going to declutter,

62
00:02:54,436 --> 00:02:55,269
and we're going to

63
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,380
serve the world".
- I think they get the idea.

64
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,988
- Okay.

65
00:02:57,988 --> 00:02:59,720
Anyway, I overwhelm myself

66
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,963
and so it's really hard,

67
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:04,613
but as I was thinking
a lot about this year

68
00:03:04,613 --> 00:03:08,728
and what I want to really, really work on

69
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:11,788
is I feel like I want to work
on my relationship with God.

70
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:16,125
I believe in God and in
the busyness of my life,

71
00:03:16,125 --> 00:03:18,241
I've allowed myself to be distracted

72
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,063
and be more distance from him

73
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:21,715
than I would like to be in my daily life.

74
00:03:21,715 --> 00:03:24,586
And so, of all the goals and dreams

75
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:25,749
that I have for this year

76
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:28,750
that's the one I want to cling to

77
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,798
and focus on everyday,

78
00:03:31,798 --> 00:03:33,173
is I just need to revitalize

79
00:03:33,173 --> 00:03:35,007
my relationship with Him.

80
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,648
And I know that that will help

81
00:03:37,648 --> 00:03:39,884
some of the other pieces
in my life fall into place.

82
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:41,759
- One of my major, like,

83
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,961
sayings that I love is

84
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,349
you know, I want to live
life for no regrets.

85
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:47,982
When I'm 75 years old and I look back,

86
00:03:47,982 --> 00:03:49,439
did I do the most important things?

87
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,873
Did I take the risks
were important to take?

88
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,961
Or the decisions that led
to the outcomes that I want?

89
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:59,153
I really believe in the concept
that we reap what we sow

90
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:00,993
and at the end of this year coming up

91
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:04,058
will I be partaking of
the fruits of the seeds

92
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:07,472
that I'm planting right now
of the happiness that I want.

93
00:04:07,472 --> 00:04:10,052
Anyway, we're thinking a lot about that.

94
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,210
We're trying to finalize,

95
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,640
like, what are the things we're gonna do.

96
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,729
- We're having a lot of good discussions

97
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,312
about where we are now

98
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,442
and what we honestly need to be working on

99
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:20,226
and sorry, you have an eyelash

100
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,084
- Oh, oh, oh

101
00:04:21,084 --> 00:04:22,049
- Well, not an eyelash

102
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,525
that would be an eyebrow hair
- You have a (mumbling)

103
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,825
(laughter)

104
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:26,349
- I think now we're both ready

105
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,353
to kinda get into some good patterns

106
00:04:28,353 --> 00:04:29,643
and a saying that I've heard before

107
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,046
that I really appreciate is,

108
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:34,069
"thrive don't just survive".

109
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:35,894
And I feel like we really need to

110
00:04:35,894 --> 00:04:36,727
- Get out of survival mode.

111
00:04:36,727 --> 00:04:38,057
- Get out of survival mode.

112
00:04:38,057 --> 00:04:40,570
And find and cling to the habits

113
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,853
that will help us build
the life that we desire.

114
00:04:42,853 --> 00:04:44,414
Because I really think sometimes,

115
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:46,953
like yes, the big things are
exciting to set goals for,

116
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,943
but a lot of times it's the little habits

117
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,044
that make up the biggest
difference in the year.

118
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:53,515
- Yeah, and fighting laziness.

119
00:04:53,515 --> 00:04:55,842
Cause laziness, you know,
- Or distraction

120
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,363
- Yeah
- Fighting distraction, like

121
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,213
(sighs)

122
00:04:58,213 --> 00:04:59,046
- I was just gonna say

123
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:01,425
I think on at least one
or two of our big goals

124
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:02,952
we wanna let you guys know about it

125
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:04,144
and that help motivate us.

126
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,935
It's been amazing.
- That would be awesome

127
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:07,229
to have accountability.

128
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,563
- Yeah so, we'll carefully consider

129
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:11,312
which goals we want to let you know about

130
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,614
because I think that'll help us feel

131
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:14,810
the excitement to get it done

132
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,297
and you can help keep us honest with it.

133
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:19,596
So, we'll let you know about
that when we figure it out.

134
00:05:19,596 --> 00:05:22,529
Thanks so much for being
part of our YouTube family

135
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:24,550
and I've loved this part of our life

136
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,417
and we have a lot of
things we're thinking about

137
00:05:26,417 --> 00:05:27,817
and talking about with the vlog too

138
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:31,359
that we're excited about
for 2015. So stay tuned.

139
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,192
J House out.

140
00:05:32,192 --> 00:05:34,092
- J House out.

141
00:05:34,092 --> 00:00:00,000
