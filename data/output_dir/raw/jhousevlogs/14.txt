1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,917
(bright playful music)

2
00:00:02,917 --> 00:00:06,221
- Nope.

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:07,804
- Eight, nine, ten!

4
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:11,038
Here I come.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,030
- So our Saturdays lately
have been really busy,

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,210
running errands, taking kids to basketball

7
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,060
and other activities and we just wanted

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,720
to take some time today and really play

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
together as a family.

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,063
So today is Janae's first
game, hide and go seek.

11
00:00:29,233 --> 00:00:30,203
Are you ready to be it?

12
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:32,521
Are you gonna find everybody?

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,354
(Janae babbling)

14
00:00:33,354 --> 00:00:34,448
Where did they go?

15
00:00:34,448 --> 00:00:35,793
Cover your eyes.

16
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:38,840
That's your head, ready?

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,340
One two three

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,423
four five six

19
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:45,866
seven eight nine ten.

20
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:48,607
Ready or not.

21
00:00:50,868 --> 00:00:51,701
Where'd they go?

22
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,280
Let's go find them, where's Isaac?

23
00:00:55,052 --> 00:00:55,885
Let's go.

24
00:00:56,764 --> 00:00:59,133
Let's go, where are they?

25
00:00:59,133 --> 00:00:59,966
Okay.

26
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:03,584
- Dadada!

27
00:01:03,584 --> 00:01:05,685
- [Jeremy] Dadada!

28
00:01:05,685 --> 00:01:06,685
- Come look.

29
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:11,340
(dramatic notes)
(Kendra laughing)

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,510
(Janae laughs)

31
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,190
- Peekaboo.

32
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,865
- [Kendra] Let's go find the
other kids, where are they?

33
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:18,015
Nae Nae, come in.

34
00:01:18,015 --> 00:01:18,867
Come see, what's inside?

35
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,130
Shoes, you see shoes?

36
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,710
Are there any people in here?

37
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:24,570
- [Jeremy] Nope.

38
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,810
- [Jeremy] False alarm,
but you led her to shoes.

39
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,808
- She was very happy about that.

40
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:30,433
- Nae Nae, look under the bed.

41
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,516
- [Elise] Hi.

42
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:34,377
- Say peekaboo.

43
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:36,231
Say I gotcha.

44
00:01:36,231 --> 00:01:37,610
- I gotcha.

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,280
- [Jeremy] She found you.

46
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,513
- [Kendra] Good job Lise.

47
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,927
(sweet playful music)

48
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,580
- [Jeremy] She's a little nervous.

49
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,025
(gasps)

50
00:01:51,025 --> 00:01:53,040
(laughing)

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,640
- She noticed the
curtain was kinda moving.

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,120
- Let's go find everyone else.

53
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,350
- She's like wait a minute.

54
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,054
There's nobody else in there.

55
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:01,887
(Caleb laughs)

56
00:02:01,887 --> 00:02:04,472
Okay Janae let's look under the bed.

57
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,230
Is there anybody under there?

58
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,063
(playful suspenseful music)

59
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:08,180
- [Jeremy] She's looking.

60
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
- [Kendra] Under the bed.

61
00:02:09,013 --> 00:02:10,250
- [Jeremy] No one's under there.

62
00:02:15,358 --> 00:02:17,220
- Alright, let's go to the next room.

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,310
So Janae's a little bit
nervous about the bathroom,

64
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,225
'cause the light's off.

65
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:22,058
Do you want to go in?

66
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,413
- [Jeremy] It's a little creepy.

67
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:26,234
(gasps)
(dramatic notes)

68
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:28,826
(laughing)

69
00:02:28,826 --> 00:02:29,743
It's Laura.

70
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,608
You found 'em all.

71
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:35,202
- Good girl.

72
00:02:35,202 --> 00:02:36,179
She found me.

73
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:37,012
- [Jeremy] She did.

74
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,206
Alright Laura, are you ready to be it?

75
00:02:38,206 --> 00:02:39,039
- Yeah.

76
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,980
- [Jeremy] Laura's turn.

77
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,350
- Now it's our turn to hide.

78
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:43,566
I don't know how quiet she's gonna be.

79
00:02:43,566 --> 00:02:44,399
- One

80
00:02:46,973 --> 00:02:47,806
two

81
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,903
three

82
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:53,407
four

83
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,863
five

84
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,313
six

85
00:02:59,354 --> 00:03:00,187
seven

86
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:02,770
eight

87
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,162
nine

88
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:05,218
ten.

89
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:06,218
Here I come!

90
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:11,825
- [Jeremy] Do you hear that?

91
00:03:11,825 --> 00:03:13,235
- Peekaboo.

92
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:16,144
- They found you!
- They found us.

93
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:17,283
(Janae babbling)

94
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:18,400
- [Jeremy] You got found.

95
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,770
Alright, go lookin'.

96
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:23,813
Nope, nobody in here.

97
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:29,930
Nobody under here.

98
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,513
Let's look up here.

99
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:38,316
Nobody under there.

100
00:03:39,893 --> 00:03:41,900
Nope, nobody back there.

101
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,903
Found you.

102
00:03:42,903 --> 00:03:44,070
- [Jeremy] Oh!

103
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,760
Okay, now we gotta find Isaac and Elise.

104
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,960
Where could they be?

105
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,050
Do you want to come help?

106
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,450
Where haven't we looked yet?

107
00:03:53,462 --> 00:03:54,295
- Hmmm.

108
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:58,169
There you are!

109
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,415
(Jeremy laughs)

110
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:01,103
- Good one Laura.

111
00:04:01,103 --> 00:04:01,936
- Get Elise.

112
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:03,400
- [Jeremy] Elise is the last one.

113
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,918
We haven't checked in the bathroom.

114
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:07,050
- Let's look in here.

115
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:07,883
Nope.

116
00:04:11,243 --> 00:04:12,860
Nope, not in there.

117
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,920
- Can we not find Elise?

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,753
- [Jeremy] No.

119
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,160
There she was, behind the curtain.

120
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,228
- Yep.

121
00:04:22,228 --> 00:04:23,780
- I couldn't find you.

122
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,528
- [Jeremy] Alright Caleb's turn, count.

123
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:27,740
- One two three

124
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,756
(playful bright music)

125
00:04:28,756 --> 00:04:29,839
four five six

126
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:33,232
seven eight nine ten.

127
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,253
Ready or not, here I come.

128
00:04:38,618 --> 00:04:39,651
Yeah!

129
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,430
(Jeremy laughing)

130
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,930
- [Jeremy] You could hear her.

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
- No, no one back here.

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,473
I guess there's no one in our room.

133
00:04:53,473 --> 00:04:55,144
(blowing raspberries)

134
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:57,561
No (laughs).

135
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,559
- [Jeremy] No.

136
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:02,290
- No.

137
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,230
Where could you possibly hide?

138
00:05:07,475 --> 00:05:08,308
Ah!

139
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,240
(Jeremy laughs)

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,140
- [Jeremy] You looked in
there and didn't even see her.

141
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,530
You were hiding good.

142
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,343
Alright who's left, Isaac and Laura.

143
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
- No one's in here.

144
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,347
No one's around, no no.

145
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:26,095
Found.

146
00:05:26,095 --> 00:05:27,628
- [Jeremy] Oh!

147
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,520
(Laura laughing)

148
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,451
Did he find you?

149
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,284
- Yeah.

150
00:05:32,284 --> 00:05:33,117
- Where is Isaac?

151
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:34,850
- [Jeremy] Alright, Isaac's the last one.

152
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,113
- Where is Isaac?

153
00:05:36,113 --> 00:05:39,183
- He's probably in the bathroom.

154
00:05:39,183 --> 00:05:40,016
- What?

155
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:44,210
- Not there.

156
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,860
- [Jeremy] Isaac's in a good hiding spot.

157
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,573
Come check harder in here.

158
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,393
(laughing)

159
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,961
- Yeah!

160
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:54,013
- [Jeremy] That was a great hiding space,

161
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:56,170
how did you fit in there?

162
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,546
- I do it all the time.

163
00:05:57,546 --> 00:06:00,700
- It's my turn now and Dad's hiding.

164
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,780
One two

165
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,930
three four

166
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,763
five six

167
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:09,550
- [Kendra] You're nice, you count slow.

168
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,060
seven eight

169
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,090
nine ten.

170
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,531
Ready or not, here I come.

171
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:19,614
(gasps) I found you.

172
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:22,553
- She wants a dog.

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,610
- Pretty sure someone

174
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:29,740
should have hid here.

175
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,573
Nope.

176
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,500
Nope.

177
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,050
Nope.

178
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,480
Nope.

179
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,533
Nope, nope.

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,350
Nope, nope.

181
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,973
- [Kendra] Everybody's having
to get pretty creative now.

182
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:46,185
- I found you.

183
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,480
- I was under Caleb's bed.

184
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,270
- Oh my goodness, that was a good spot.

185
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,770
- I think someone's breathing.

186
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:55,459
(dramatic note)

187
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,459
I found you.

188
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,998
- [Kendra] That was a good one Caleb.

189
00:06:58,998 --> 00:07:00,090
- It's uncomfortable in there,

190
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,570
so I didn't really want
to stay in there long.

191
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,890
- [Kendra] Yeah, good idea.

192
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,820
- Nope.

193
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,570
Isaac and Dad are left.

194
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,816
- [Kendra] They're good hiders.

195
00:07:08,816 --> 00:07:09,649
- Ah-ya!

196
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:14,183
- [Kendra] Oh that was clever.

197
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:21,746
- Nope.

198
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,978
(laughing)

199
00:07:26,978 --> 00:07:28,561
- Daddy scared her.

200
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,663
- [Laura] Daddy!

201
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:32,573
- You were right here there,

202
00:07:32,573 --> 00:07:33,977
you were just like, nope.

203
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:35,873
And I was right here.

204
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,860
- [Kendra] Clever spot,
you scared your baby.

205
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,693
- Sorry Nae Nae.

206
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,533
Dad what are you doing?

207
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:42,463
- [Caleb] Dad, where were you?

208
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,780
- [Jeremy] I was hiding right here.

209
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,020
- Now we have--

210
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,853
- [Jeremy] Isaac.

211
00:07:45,853 --> 00:07:47,000
- Yes!

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,090
- [Jeremy] We gotta find Isaac.

213
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,930
- Isaac is good at hiding.

214
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,830
- [Jeremy] He's really good at hiding.

215
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,612
- [Caleb] Looks like no
one's in the curtain.

216
00:07:57,612 --> 00:08:00,362
(dramatic music)

217
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,530
- So we can't find Isaac.

218
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,699
All of us are looking.

219
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,530
- Let's look in the pantry.

220
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,783
- [Jeremy] Let's check it.

221
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,663
No.

222
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:24,800
- [Kendra] Nobody wants
to hide by the trash.

223
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,781
- [Jeremy] Yeah, that's true.

224
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,614
- No.

225
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,720
- He's hid up here before but--

226
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,679
- [Jeremy] I looked, I looked for that.

227
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,979
This is a good hiding spot.

228
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,780
- [Kendra] He must be
laughing so hard at us.

229
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,530
I bet he has a handle on how
much he's laughing right now.

230
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,583
- [Elise] Yeah.

231
00:08:43,453 --> 00:08:45,170
'Cause all of us are looking

232
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,463
and we can't find him.

233
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,740
- [Jeremy] Did we check
behind the chair in our room?

234
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,296
That blue chair?

235
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,230
- [Kendra] No.

236
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,870
- [Jeremy] Let's check, is he back here?

237
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,880
- [Elise] Nope.

238
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,610
- Maybe behind the pillows?

239
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,443
- [Jeremy] No.

240
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,020
I found him you guys.

241
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,430
I know where he is.

242
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,230
Go check in your room one more time.

243
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,079
(Jeremy laughs)

244
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:10,220
Shhh.

245
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,200
Okay you guys I'm gonna give you a hint.

246
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,900
He is in our room.

247
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,243
He's in this room.

248
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:21,854
- Isaac!

249
00:09:21,854 --> 00:09:22,728
Isaac!

250
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,460
- [Jeremy] Genius.

251
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,720
- At first I was like gosh,

252
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,050
I gotta not let them see my body,

253
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,883
that's gonna be hard

254
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:31,950
and then I was like
oh, I have clothes too.

255
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,710
- [Jeremy] Okay, who would
like to play hide and go seek?

256
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,790
- Wherever your family is,

257
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,330
be sure to take a moment from the business

258
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,950
and enjoy time together
in some simple little way.

259
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,926
Good night, J House out.

260
00:09:40,926 --> 00:09:43,176
(laughing)

261
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,510
(bright electronic music)

262
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:54,328
- Tyrannosaurus Rex is real, too.

263
00:09:59,480 --> 00:00:00,000
- [Jeremy] Laura, are
you gonna do some art?
