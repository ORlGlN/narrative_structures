1
00:00:00,304 --> 00:00:03,721
- Laura woke up super early this morning,

2
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:07,264
and so I was going to attempt

3
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:12,594
to try to sleep on the
couch while she was awake,

4
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:15,344
and so I created some barricades,

5
00:00:18,214 --> 00:00:21,547
see I put her down there with some toys,

6
00:00:22,477 --> 00:00:25,937
and I like blocked off everything,

7
00:00:25,937 --> 00:00:27,679
I moved the couch over here

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,762
so she couldn't fall down the stairs.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,115
Now that I'm waking up a little bit more

10
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:39,192
I realize this might
not be a very good idea.

11
00:00:39,192 --> 00:00:42,942
(lighthearted, upbeat music)

12
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:08,811
- I get asked a lot
about how I home school

13
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,073
different kids at different ages,

14
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:12,557
because their abilities are all different,

15
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:13,995
and this morning as we
were doing our activity

16
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:15,816
I thought I'd grab the camera to show you

17
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,568
because this is an activity
that worked really well

18
00:01:18,568 --> 00:01:20,074
with their different age levels,

19
00:01:20,074 --> 00:01:23,307
so what we did today is we
went shopping as a family.

20
00:01:23,307 --> 00:01:26,057
I have these alphabet cards here,

21
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,673
and the kids would just
pick an alphabet card,

22
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:32,383
and then they would take
their letter downstairs,

23
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,070
and one at a time they
would pick out a toy,

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,930
so for example with B you could do

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,841
a ball or a bandana or whatever.

26
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,694
Elise did you just buy a princess outfit?

27
00:01:41,694 --> 00:01:42,549
- [Elise] Mm hmm.

28
00:01:42,549 --> 00:01:43,559
- [Kendra] What letter did you have?

29
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:44,400
- P.

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,174
- [Kendra] P, what sound does P make?

31
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:47,628
- P-p-p princess.

32
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:48,777
- And I just did T.

33
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:50,689
- [Kendra] You just did
T, what did you buy?

34
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,971
- These, um, these make trails.

35
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:56,444
- [Kendra] Those make trails, very nice.

36
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:58,737
Caleb, I would ask him to count

37
00:01:58,737 --> 00:02:02,339
a certain number of
coins into the container,

38
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:05,236
so I didn't ask him to
differentiate between any of them,

39
00:02:05,236 --> 00:02:07,812
I just asked him to be
counting, and I helped him.

40
00:02:07,812 --> 00:02:09,372
Elise, when she paid for things,

41
00:02:09,372 --> 00:02:12,154
I gave her a number and a specific type,

42
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:14,577
so we talked about the
difference between these,

43
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:16,190
so she would find six dimes,

44
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,703
or she would count,
y'know, seven quarters,

45
00:02:19,703 --> 00:02:21,644
so she was differentiating between type

46
00:02:21,644 --> 00:02:23,180
and talking to me about them,

47
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,223
and then with Isaac I could just tell him,

48
00:02:25,223 --> 00:02:27,606
that costs a dollar and 17 cents,

49
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,155
and he would count that out.

50
00:02:29,155 --> 00:02:33,919
- Four quarters, one dime,
one nickel and two pennies.

51
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,945
- So my other favorite
thing about this activity is

52
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:38,205
because I have them shopping downstairs,

53
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:40,588
I got to teach them one at a time,

54
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:43,955
and so I was here counting with Elise

55
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,504
and teaching her about the coins,

56
00:02:45,504 --> 00:02:48,580
and then I would instruct
her on her next letter,

57
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,986
and she would go downstairs to find

58
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:52,739
something that represented
that letter's sound,

59
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,371
and by that point Isaac
was coming up or Caleb,

60
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,363
and it ended up being a
really great activity.

61
00:02:59,363 --> 00:03:02,141
It probably only took us about 20 minutes,

62
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,224
and I think they each just
did four things maybe,

63
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,464
but that was reviewing letter sounds,

64
00:03:09,464 --> 00:03:11,585
it was playing, and it was also

65
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:12,915
working on money and numbers,

66
00:03:12,915 --> 00:03:14,601
so now we're gonna go
in to our reading time.

67
00:03:14,601 --> 00:03:15,834
But that's just one example

68
00:03:15,834 --> 00:03:17,913
of one of the hands-on activities,

69
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:20,807
we'll still be doing
Isaac's math book later,

70
00:03:20,807 --> 00:03:22,006
but this is just a kind of

71
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:24,114
morning interactive activities that we do.

72
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:27,839
Uhm I just noticed in the
background this awesome sauce.

73
00:03:27,839 --> 00:03:29,587
- That's so Kendra.

74
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:32,557
Kendra will have seven
cups in the bedroom,

75
00:03:32,557 --> 00:03:34,018
like all half full.

76
00:03:34,018 --> 00:03:36,297
- Hey, at least two of
those are in the bathroom,

77
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:37,884
and then there's like
three on the counter,

78
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,742
I just, apparently
really like to have cups,

79
00:03:39,742 --> 00:03:43,390
and they usually all have
about that much water in them.

80
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,609
Guess I'm just not a
finisher, can't do it.

81
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:47,526
We got the crazy thing.

82
00:03:48,421 --> 00:03:49,994
- The Mesh Eater.

83
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:51,994
- The Mesh Feeder Eater.

84
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:56,932
It's got 'nanna in it,
whaddya think big girl?

85
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:59,099
- [Jeremy] She's like ehh.

86
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,934
- Yes, you are a recorded child.

87
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:11,920
Does it taste yummy?

88
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,433
- [Jeremy] Oop, she's going for more.

89
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:18,016
Oh, sick, try again, try again.

90
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,538
- [Kendra] That was classic.

91
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:27,756
Great face there Laura.

92
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:29,412
(Laura gurgling)

93
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,329
Oh, buh, buh, buh, buh?

94
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:35,335
Say goodnight.

95
00:04:35,335 --> 00:04:37,418
- Say nap time, nap time.

96
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,605
- After a long morning,
nap time is delicious.

97
00:04:45,924 --> 00:00:00,000
(lighthearted, upbeat music)
