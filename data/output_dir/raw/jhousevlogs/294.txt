1
00:00:01,568 --> 00:00:03,275
- Cassette definitely says pregnant.

2
00:00:03,275 --> 00:00:05,177
I am, I'm pregnant.

3
00:00:05,177 --> 00:00:08,214
- Laura, you're gonna have a little baby.

4
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:10,047
- Is that a baby bump?

5
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:12,066
I think it's a baby bump.

6
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:15,230
I posted a picture on Instagram
today of my baby bump,

7
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,433
and how big it's getting.

8
00:00:17,433 --> 00:00:19,720
- Girl, it's a girl.

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,583
(cheers)

10
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:22,953
- So these contractions
feel very different.

11
00:00:22,953 --> 00:00:24,438
Three shots, I'm getting one in each arm

12
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:26,605
and one on my bum, my bum.

13
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:29,131
What do you think we should name the baby?

14
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:29,964
- A star.

15
00:00:31,344 --> 00:00:32,177
- Star?

16
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:35,458
It's your little sister.

17
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:41,472
I am in labor.

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,667
(screams)

19
00:00:48,262 --> 00:00:49,262
It's a girl.

20
00:00:51,909 --> 00:00:53,225
(exhaling deeply)

21
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:54,642
This is our baby.

22
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:58,067
(baby talk)

23
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,525
All right, so the topic
of discussion tonight is--

24
00:01:03,525 --> 00:01:06,025
- Should we have another baby?

25
00:01:06,873 --> 00:01:08,956
(laughs)

26
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:14,920
- She's just at such a fun stage.

27
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,396
I just love talking to
her and holding her,

28
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:21,227
and just oh, it just
makes my heart smooth.

29
00:01:21,227 --> 00:01:22,856
It's certainly getting really
hard for me not to want

30
00:01:22,856 --> 00:01:24,902
to have another baby, like constantly.

31
00:01:24,902 --> 00:01:27,189
I'm like oh, it's not the
right time for us yet.

32
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,591
I know that in my heart,

33
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:29,993
and so I'm just trying to be patient,

34
00:01:29,993 --> 00:01:32,115
and snuggle, and hug on this one.

35
00:01:32,115 --> 00:01:34,365
(smooches)

36
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:39,580
Come on, you can't blame me
for wanting another baby,

37
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,452
which is so sweet.

38
00:01:41,452 --> 00:01:42,772
The kids were talking
about how they would love

39
00:01:42,772 --> 00:01:44,258
to have another baby in our family,

40
00:01:44,258 --> 00:01:46,371
and I said their dad would
love to have another baby

41
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:47,479
in our family too.

42
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,724
It's just a little bit overwhelming.

43
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:50,559
It's a lot of work, and
the kids started talking

44
00:01:50,559 --> 00:01:52,401
amongst themselves and Isaac was like,

45
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,845
"But mum, we can help."

46
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:55,772
They had this whole plan
of how they were gonna work

47
00:01:55,772 --> 00:01:58,869
extra hard so that we could
have another baby in our family.

48
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,321
I just thought that was so sweet.

49
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:02,933
(exhaling deeply)

50
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:06,164
Well, let's sit on that for a minute.

51
00:02:06,164 --> 00:02:07,581
It's kind of sad.

52
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:11,608
Fertility is not something
they take for granted.

53
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:14,026
I see it as a beautiful, beautiful gift,

54
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:16,356
and blessing to feel to be
these children's mother.

55
00:02:16,356 --> 00:02:18,567
We don't think that our family's done

56
00:02:18,567 --> 00:02:20,268
but we don't know when
we're gonna be lucky enough

57
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:21,899
to be blessed with another child.

58
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:23,432
I'm kind of shaking right now

59
00:02:23,432 --> 00:02:26,778
but my heart and Jeremy's
heart is still desiring

60
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,597
to have another baby.

61
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:33,402
So if that would happen, we'd
be really excited about it.

62
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:36,365
So I'm gonna take a pregnancy test now.

63
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,009
Let's see what happens.

64
00:02:38,009 --> 00:02:40,938
Oh my God guys, I'm shaking

65
00:02:40,938 --> 00:02:44,438
because cassette definitely says pregnant.

66
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,149
I'm grateful and emotional.

67
00:02:50,243 --> 00:02:52,326
(laughs)

68
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:56,201
- We're pregnant, we're gonna have a baby.

69
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:59,368
- It's a big deal guys, that's a baby.

70
00:03:01,586 --> 00:03:03,669
(laughs)

71
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,881
Well this weekend's honestly
been really hard for me

72
00:03:17,881 --> 00:03:19,392
because of how sick I've been

73
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:21,089
but I talked to my doctor today,

74
00:03:21,089 --> 00:03:23,756
and we're looking for solutions.

75
00:03:24,868 --> 00:03:26,535
So guys, guess what?

76
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,629
We have a surprise for you.

77
00:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,679
- Is it a big surprise?

78
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,689
- I think it's a pretty big surprise.

79
00:03:36,689 --> 00:03:38,033
- Wait, do you know it?

80
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,087
- I do know it.

81
00:03:39,087 --> 00:03:40,835
First, we're gonna look at some pictures

82
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,544
together as a family, okay.

83
00:03:42,544 --> 00:03:43,685
Do you guys know who this looks like?

84
00:03:43,685 --> 00:03:44,960
- Isaac.

85
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,460
- It's baby Isaac.

86
00:03:47,647 --> 00:03:48,842
- [Laura] Baby Isaac.

87
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:49,675
- [Kendra] Yeah.

88
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,694
Who is this one?

89
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:51,621
- Elise.

90
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:52,621
- Baby Elise.

91
00:03:52,621 --> 00:03:55,289
- She was a cutie, my beauty.

92
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:57,156
- [Kendra] This is baby Caleb guys.

93
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,741
All right, who's this one?

94
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:00,178
- [Children] Laura.

95
00:04:00,178 --> 00:04:01,345
- Yeah, Laura.

96
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:04,481
So guys, guess what?

97
00:04:06,003 --> 00:04:09,369
We have had four beautiful
babies in our family,

98
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,671
and we are going to have another baby.

99
00:04:11,671 --> 00:04:13,294
(gasping)

100
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,179
We are having a new baby.

101
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:17,346
(gasping)

102
00:04:19,156 --> 00:04:21,911
- It doesn't look like you're
gonna have another baby.

103
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:23,861
- I know, it's 'cause the
baby's is really little.

104
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:25,178
It has to grow.

105
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,247
- Oh, are you pregnant?

106
00:04:26,247 --> 00:04:28,469
- I am, I'm pregnant.

107
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:31,886
- Laura, you're gonna have a little baby.

108
00:04:32,969 --> 00:04:34,466
You're gonna be a big sister.

109
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:35,708
- I hope it's a sister.

110
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,806
Your tummy is a little bigger.

111
00:04:37,806 --> 00:04:38,639
- Thanks.

112
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,780
- I want to feel the baby laugh.

113
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,498
- You can't feel the baby yet.

114
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,988
Do you know how little that baby is?

115
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,778
- Like probably that big?

116
00:04:46,778 --> 00:04:47,611
- This big.

117
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:49,398
- I can show you guys, how big it is.

118
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:50,637
You guys want to see?

119
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:51,470
- Yeah.

120
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,651
- You guys see this
little tiny poppy seed?

121
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:55,904
That's how big our baby is right now.

122
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,136
- What?

123
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:59,016
- Can I get it?

124
00:04:59,016 --> 00:04:59,985
- It's a she?

125
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:02,009
I'll call it a she.

126
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:03,423
- Good plan.

127
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:05,240
- But how's it so small?

128
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,473
- Because it starts so small
and then it gets bigger,

129
00:05:08,473 --> 00:05:10,667
and bigger, and then we
will go to the hospital,

130
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:13,493
and get the baby, and
then bring the baby home.

131
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:15,404
- Where's the baby go?

132
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:19,111
- I think she thinks the
poppy seed is a baby.

133
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,743
Laura, Laura, the baby
sits inside my tummy.

134
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:23,685
- There's a baby in mine.

135
00:05:23,685 --> 00:05:25,502
- There's a baby in your tummy?

136
00:05:25,502 --> 00:05:26,834
- Are you going to feel it?

137
00:05:26,834 --> 00:05:29,150
- Oh sure, you have a
little baby in there?

138
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,696
- You can feel it in here.

139
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,196
- Feel it in here?

140
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:37,617
- Is that your tummy?

141
00:05:37,617 --> 00:05:39,901
- Does anyone else know yet?

142
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:42,717
- No, do you guys wanna tell people.

143
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,960
- Yeah, for sure.

144
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,069
- For sure?

145
00:05:46,069 --> 00:05:48,638
Do you guys want to
call and tell somebody?

146
00:05:48,638 --> 00:05:52,185
- Yeah I wanna tell
everyone in our family.

147
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,852
(phone ringing)

148
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,152
(faint statement)

149
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:06,819
- [All] We're having a new baby.

150
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,083
- [Phone Lady] What?

151
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:11,180
- Tell her, tell her.

152
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,097
- We have another baby.

153
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:16,058
- [Phone Lady] You got a new bed?

154
00:06:16,058 --> 00:06:17,236
(laughs)

155
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:18,444
- Not a new bed.

156
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,378
Caleb you tell her.

157
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,461
- A new baby.

158
00:06:22,019 --> 00:06:24,686
- [All] We're having a new baby.

159
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:29,153
- We having another baby.

160
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:32,464
- [Phone Lady] No way.

161
00:06:32,464 --> 00:06:33,664
- Yes, we are.

162
00:06:33,664 --> 00:06:34,840
- Yes, we are.

163
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,681
- Yes, we are.

164
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,861
- I've been very morning sick.

165
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:40,410
I've been throwing up a lot
and it's just kind of been

166
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,073
miserable so I was talking to my doctor,

167
00:06:43,073 --> 00:06:44,963
and they're worried about
me being too dehydrated,

168
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:48,057
and so we decided to pump
me up with some IV fluids.

169
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:52,057
So I went in today and
yeah, got some IV fluids.

170
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:55,657
It's been a couple of hours
since I got it put in.

171
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,487
I still haven't had to pee.

172
00:06:57,487 --> 00:07:01,400
So that to me is a sign
that I was very dehydrated.

173
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,319
I actually feel hungry.

174
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,452
Like one thing sounds
good to me right now.

175
00:07:05,452 --> 00:07:09,119
So Jeremy's gonna run
out and get it for me.

176
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:18,033
What are we gonna do
with that baby's diapers?

177
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:21,261
- Change your diaper, I
can change your diaper.

178
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:23,414
- You're gonna change the baby's diaper?

179
00:07:23,414 --> 00:07:25,893
- Did they have to cut open the tummy?

180
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,746
- For some mummies,
they cut open the tummy.

181
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:30,122
But what if it's a boy?

182
00:07:30,122 --> 00:07:32,000
- I don't even know.

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,752
- Five is already a lot of kids.

184
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:36,919
- Let's just go up to six.

185
00:07:38,095 --> 00:07:39,043
- Laura guess what?

186
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:39,876
- What?

187
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,752
- We're gonna have a new baby.

188
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,246
- I can hold it?

189
00:07:43,246 --> 00:07:44,918
- Yeah, you can hold it.

190
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,819
So do you think it's gonna be
a new brother or a new sister?

191
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:50,553
- New brother, because we don't have

192
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,224
that much boys in the house.

193
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:54,057
- No?

194
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:54,890
So what do you think?

195
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,523
- It's awesome, now I can
actually really change,

196
00:07:57,523 --> 00:08:01,084
like learn how to really
change her diapers.

197
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,487
- Yeah, you're excited about that?

198
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:03,320
- Uh huh.

199
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,391
- What do you think that
there's a baby in there?

200
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:07,913
- I think it might be a girl.

201
00:08:07,913 --> 00:08:09,048
- You think it might be a girl?

202
00:08:09,048 --> 00:08:11,608
- Yeah, because then I can
like play with her more

203
00:08:11,608 --> 00:08:13,033
dress 'em up.

204
00:08:13,033 --> 00:08:13,866
- Yeah.

205
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:16,573
- And make sure she
doesn't fall on the ground.

206
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:18,034
- That's a really important thing.

207
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:21,498
- Do you think it's gonna be
a boy baby or a girl baby?

208
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:22,665
- A cute baby.

209
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:27,374
- Are you gonna be a big sister?

210
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,640
What are you gonna do
with being a big sister?

211
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,557
- I get to hold her and do like a--

212
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:35,228
- Oh, so soft.

213
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:39,135
- Any present?

214
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:40,731
- Yeah.

215
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,583
- Any present?

216
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,960
- Are we gonna give the baby presents?

217
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,793
- Yeah.

218
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:48,912
- Yeah, we give the baby presents.

219
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:51,068
- It's my present.

220
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,515
- Oh, maybe they'll be your presents?

221
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,360
- Yeah.

222
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,554
- What are we thinking about for names?

223
00:08:56,554 --> 00:08:59,138
- That's a good point,
that's a good point.

224
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,162
We're still deciding so
until your daddy and I

225
00:09:01,162 --> 00:09:02,748
are a little bit more decided,

226
00:09:02,748 --> 00:09:04,453
we probably won't talk about it yet

227
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:08,329
but if you have any suggestions
for names, let me know.

228
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:09,998
All right, this morning
is Jeremy and my turn

229
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:12,376
to host Lego summer camp
and I'm really excited.

230
00:09:12,376 --> 00:09:15,117
We planned some fun stuff, and
it's gonna be an awesome day.

231
00:09:15,117 --> 00:09:17,935
♫ Grow bananas, grow, grow, bananas

232
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:20,847
♫ Grow bananas, grow, grow, bananas

233
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:24,185
♫ Peel bananas, peel, peel, bananas

234
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:27,419
- [Jeremy] Only one more left.

235
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,478
(upbeat music)

236
00:09:29,478 --> 00:09:31,403
Oh they all came back.

237
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,820
The Legos win it!

238
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,010
And the ceremonial dump
on the coach. (laughs)

239
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,726
- [Boy] Dump it on the coach.

240
00:09:38,726 --> 00:09:41,309
(upbeat music)

241
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:46,341
(splashing)

242
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:11,070
- So we tried to go on a
walk like we like to do,

243
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,679
and we made it about 20 yards.

244
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,692
So we almost made it to that tree.

245
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:17,861
(laughs)

246
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:20,307
- And I'm like oh, that was rough.

247
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:21,896
- So I'm proud of her for trying.

248
00:10:21,896 --> 00:10:24,102
Morning sickness is
such a unique sickness.

249
00:10:24,102 --> 00:10:25,493
Sometimes you do feel a little bit better.

250
00:10:25,493 --> 00:10:27,834
She did get fluids but no.

251
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,039
- So when I pretend that I'm
just from the parking lot,

252
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:32,602
and we come in into Carters,
which is a baby store.

253
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:34,138
We're gonna buy something for our baby

254
00:10:34,138 --> 00:10:35,638
because I want to.

255
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:38,856
Is this called retail therapy?

256
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:41,356
(light music)

257
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,429
Ain't that cute?

258
00:10:48,535 --> 00:10:50,486
So for the most part, our
kids wear hand-me-downs

259
00:10:50,486 --> 00:10:52,224
but I always like to get
them like a coming home

260
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:53,796
from the hospital outfit,
so I'm gonna get a boy one,

261
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:56,746
and a girl one because I can.

262
00:10:56,746 --> 00:11:00,783
Okay, this is making me
feel a little bit better.

263
00:11:00,783 --> 00:11:02,416
But today when we went to the doctor,

264
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,426
they took a picture of the baby.

265
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:07,610
- How can they go inside your body?

266
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,365
- They didn't, they used what's
called ultrasound technology

267
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:13,080
and they put a wand on my
tummy, and it showed them

268
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,070
what the inside looks like.

269
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,508
Do you want to see it?

270
00:11:17,508 --> 00:11:21,675
All right, here's our first
picture of our little baby.

271
00:11:24,276 --> 00:11:26,271
- [Jeremy] Looks just like you Caleb.

272
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:28,650
- So does it have seven more weeks?

273
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,259
- No, it says this is
our baby at seven weeks.

274
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,830
- Is that the head?

275
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,292
- You know what, I honestly don't know.

276
00:11:35,292 --> 00:11:36,891
- We've had it for seven weeks?

277
00:11:36,891 --> 00:11:37,751
- Yeah.

278
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:41,043
- It does not look like a human.

279
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:43,237
- [Jeremy] Kendra called
it our little bean.

280
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:44,968
- Doesn't it look like a little bean?

281
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,591
Where's the baby?

282
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:47,821
- Right there.

283
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,601
- Right there.

284
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:50,882
Is it so cute?

285
00:11:50,882 --> 00:11:52,404
- Yeah, can I touch it?

286
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:54,247
- You can touch the picture.

287
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,441
- [Jeremy] Let me grab a grape for us.

288
00:11:56,441 --> 00:12:00,133
- All right, so this is about
the size of our little baby.

289
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,863
- So that's basically real size.

290
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,824
- Maybe at this moment then.

291
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:06,940
- I want to eat it.

292
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,773
- Oh we're not eating it.

293
00:12:07,773 --> 00:12:11,495
- That's about how big it is in real life.

294
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,121
- [Jeremy] No, my baby.

295
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:15,204
(laughs)

296
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:17,514
- I like the baby.

297
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:18,916
- Oh I'm glad you like the baby.

298
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:20,063
- Why it isn't walking?

299
00:12:20,063 --> 00:12:21,903
- It's not walking, it's just lying there.

300
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:22,793
Don't eat it.

301
00:12:22,793 --> 00:12:25,126
(baby talk)

302
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:32,863
(laughs)

303
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:34,507
So I totally think I'm starting to show,

304
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,143
which makes me feel a little crazy

305
00:12:36,143 --> 00:12:37,543
like I'm not even 10 weeks,

306
00:12:37,543 --> 00:12:39,421
how can I possibly be showing yet?

307
00:12:39,421 --> 00:12:41,088
Is that a baby bump?

308
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:43,360
I think it's a baby bump.

309
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,481
- [Jeremy] Do you like
watching the Olympics?

310
00:12:45,481 --> 00:12:47,066
- No.

311
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:47,899
- Yes.

312
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:53,868
- [Jeremy] Do you know what the tune is

313
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:55,453
for the Olympic anthem?

314
00:12:55,453 --> 00:12:57,620
(humming)

315
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,278
Can you say Olympics?

316
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:06,679
- Olympics.

317
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,667
- [Jeremy] Here my ca-ba-da-ba-doo.

318
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,545
It's ca-ba-doos, ca-ba-doo's turn.

319
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:11,520
- Hi.

320
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,641
- [Jeremy] What are the Olympics?

321
00:13:13,641 --> 00:13:15,638
- It's a big sport.

322
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:18,759
- It's an event that a lot
of countries get together

323
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,092
and play sports.

324
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:22,930
- [Jeremy] You don't have your glasses on.

325
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,904
It looks so different.

326
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:24,745
- Yeah.

327
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,912
- [Jeremy] Where are they?

328
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:29,589
She's a sprinter.

329
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,460
If you just found out
that you won a gold medal,

330
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,877
what would your face be like?

331
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,555
So imagine that you just won a gold medal.

332
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:50,408
What would your face be like?

333
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:51,432
- So happy.

334
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:52,661
- [Announcer] And the newest winner of

335
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:54,661
the gold medal is Elise.

336
00:13:56,283 --> 00:13:59,950
- [Jeremy] You won a
gold medal, would you--

337
00:14:01,584 --> 00:14:04,536
- [Announcer] And the winner
of the gold medal is Isaac.

338
00:14:04,536 --> 00:14:06,619
- Yes, a dream come true.

339
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:10,799
- [Jeremy] Is this gymnastics?

340
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,049
Whoa, good job.

341
00:14:18,736 --> 00:14:21,111
- I felt the baby move for
the first time yesterday.

342
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:22,964
Like last night, I was
like oh my goodness,

343
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,964
there's a baby in there.

344
00:14:26,143 --> 00:14:28,471
- [Isaac] Oh yeah a bit.

345
00:14:28,471 --> 00:14:29,424
- [Jeremy] What are you doing in there?

346
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:32,472
- Okay, so it's this place
is pretty empty today

347
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,912
and the women's bathroom
is locked, and I had to go.

348
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:37,752
So I was like Jeremy, I'm
going into the men's room.

349
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,403
- I kind of tortured her a little bit.

350
00:14:39,403 --> 00:14:41,956
I like open the door while
she's inside, "Hello."

351
00:14:41,956 --> 00:14:44,888
- He checked that there
was nobody in there.

352
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:45,721
Come on.

353
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,433
(footsteps clocking)

354
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:54,991
(upbeat music)

355
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:08,221
- [Jeremy] Well, we love
walking and talking.

356
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:09,449
- It's a great date night.

357
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:10,282
We're out of shape.

358
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:13,202
Well, I posted a picture on
Instagram today of my baby bump,

359
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:14,689
and how big it's getting.

360
00:15:14,689 --> 00:15:17,827
Then we looked at pictures
from my previous pregnancies,

361
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:19,481
and it's not in my head, it's real guys.

362
00:15:19,481 --> 00:15:21,017
I am way bigger this time.

363
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,456
Like I pulled up a picture
with me at 20 weeks with Isaac,

364
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,176
and 23 weeks with Elise.

365
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:27,514
I'll have Jeremy like
put the pictures in here

366
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:29,456
but the kids, like we're
looking at the pictures,

367
00:15:29,456 --> 00:15:31,041
they're like, "Mum, you're
bigger than that now."

368
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:32,458
I'm like, thanks.

369
00:15:44,997 --> 00:15:47,997
- [Jeremy] You were so great, buddy.

370
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:51,215
- Well, we are here and they
are heading into school.

371
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:52,960
We made it on time.

372
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,067
Score a win for the mum right here.

373
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,526
- It's really just sweet
to talk to them about

374
00:15:56,526 --> 00:15:58,383
how they're gonna have an
opportunity to reach out

375
00:15:58,383 --> 00:16:00,908
and find ways to love others
today, and make new friends.

376
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:03,344
I'm just excited for them.

377
00:16:03,344 --> 00:16:05,060
Yes Elise, bye.

378
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,452
- Bye.

379
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:07,403
- Excited?

380
00:16:07,403 --> 00:16:08,842
Okay, let's go in.

381
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,075
Give me a hug baby.

382
00:16:10,075 --> 00:16:11,378
I love you, bye.

383
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:12,767
All the kids did great
getting dropped off,

384
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:16,447
and I'm just happy for
this opportunity for them.

385
00:16:16,447 --> 00:16:18,568
It's such a beautiful mix for our family,

386
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:19,814
homeschooling four days a week

387
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:21,190
and then one day of the week,

388
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,544
they come to this private school that has

389
00:16:22,544 --> 00:16:24,394
a homeschool enrichment program.

390
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:26,785
They get to enjoy being in
their classes with their friends

391
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:27,920
and their teachers.

392
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,774
I just teared up on the
way into the school.

393
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,271
I was glad I was wearing
sunglasses, and nobody could see.

394
00:16:34,271 --> 00:16:38,538
- So there was an earthquake at our house.

395
00:16:38,538 --> 00:16:39,416
- Really?

396
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,249
- Yeah.

397
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,082
- Like here?

398
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:43,038
- Like here, it happened just barely.

399
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:44,046
Didn't you feel it?

400
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,111
- No.

401
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:46,378
- Me neither.

402
00:16:46,378 --> 00:16:47,705
I'm so frustrated.

403
00:16:47,705 --> 00:16:50,460
On social media, all of our
friends are like going crazy

404
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,216
about this earthquake.

405
00:16:52,216 --> 00:16:55,309
Our friends four houses down evacuated

406
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,480
their house because of it.

407
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,349
Everyone's like, we woke up
and there was an earthquake.

408
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:02,212
- And we just totally missed it.

409
00:17:02,212 --> 00:17:03,282
- I didn't feel it at all.

410
00:17:03,282 --> 00:17:05,430
We were awake, all of the kids were awake,

411
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,088
and I didn't feel anything.

412
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:07,921
- Me neither.

413
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:08,753
- [Jeremy] I was robbed.

414
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:10,964
- I was so used to our
house being under chaos

415
00:17:10,964 --> 00:17:13,801
that we didn't notice
somehow or maybe like the

416
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,070
ripple effect of the earthquake

417
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:17,606
like they felt it strong, and we didn't.

418
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:20,429
- Caleb, do you see the firefighters?

419
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:23,346
We're gonna go see the forest fire.

420
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,887
♫ Twinkle little stars

421
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,621
- [Jeremy] Laura, what are you doing?

422
00:17:36,621 --> 00:17:37,913
- We're just playing.

423
00:17:37,913 --> 00:17:39,162
- [Jeremy] What are you guys playing?

424
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:41,505
- We're just playing mum-baby.

425
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:42,967
- [Jeremy] Oh, who's the mum?

426
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:44,806
- She's the mum, and I'm the baby.

427
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,139
- [Jeremy] Okay.

428
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,923
- And now's the moment that
we've been waiting for all day.

429
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:02,448
We are headed in for
our 20-week ultrasound.

430
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,911
So we're gonna check on
the health of the baby,

431
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:06,324
and hopefully find out the gender.

432
00:18:06,324 --> 00:18:07,859
So any last guesses.

433
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,103
- Yeah, I've been thinking it's a girl.

434
00:18:10,103 --> 00:18:12,603
(piano music)

435
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,803
- [Jeremy] It's out
little baby's heartbeat.

436
00:18:25,803 --> 00:18:28,023
- I'm most relieved as
they go through each organ,

437
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:31,367
and look at each part just
to see a healthy baby.

438
00:18:31,367 --> 00:18:33,643
So this is our baby.

439
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,328
- That looks cute.

440
00:18:35,328 --> 00:18:37,313
- Does it look cute?

441
00:18:37,313 --> 00:18:38,887
That's our baby.

442
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,657
So when we were there,
they were able to find out

443
00:18:40,657 --> 00:18:44,349
if it was a baby boy
baby or a baby girl baby.

444
00:18:44,349 --> 00:18:45,836
All right, everybody's eyes closed.

445
00:18:45,836 --> 00:18:47,201
- [Children] Yes.

446
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:50,146
- One, two, three, you can open.

447
00:18:50,146 --> 00:18:51,813
- Girl, it's a girl.

448
00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:55,170
(screams)

449
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,337
(popping)

450
00:19:09,725 --> 00:19:11,296
- It's a girl.

451
00:19:11,296 --> 00:19:13,699
- [All] It's a girl.

452
00:19:13,699 --> 00:19:14,877
- [Kendra] You can open.

453
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:16,544
- Girl, it's a girl.

454
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:21,714
We're all gonna have a baby sister.

455
00:19:24,395 --> 00:19:26,087
It's a girl.

456
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:27,708
- [Kendra] Laura look, look.

457
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,875
- It's a girl.

458
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:32,392
- [Kendra] She's still at guessing it.

459
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,219
It's a girl.

460
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:35,948
- [Caleb] I'm sad.

461
00:19:35,948 --> 00:19:37,643
- You're such a good big brother buddy.

462
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:39,534
- Oh, it's still fine.

463
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:42,081
I had wanted a cute brother, Laura.

464
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,381
- What do you think Isaac?

465
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:45,965
- I'm fine, I really like Laura.

466
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,183
She's been very cute.

467
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:48,256
- She's fun huh.

468
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:50,200
So having another little
sister will be good?

469
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,966
You're awesome.

470
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:52,932
(smooches)

471
00:19:52,932 --> 00:19:53,998
What are you thinking buddy?

472
00:19:53,998 --> 00:19:55,831
- I'm a little sad but

473
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:59,685
I'm fine with any.

474
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:00,518
- Yeah?

475
00:20:00,518 --> 00:20:02,376
All right, it's time for
our baby sister party.

476
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,902
(cheers)

477
00:20:04,902 --> 00:20:06,725
Who wants to try that cake?

478
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:08,058
- [Jeremy] I do.

479
00:20:19,342 --> 00:20:21,197
- Can we start talking about baby names

480
00:20:21,197 --> 00:20:22,956
tonight or something.

481
00:20:22,956 --> 00:20:25,106
- Your dad and I are
definitely gonna start it.

482
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,051
This one's the profile up closer.

483
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:30,271
You can see there's a
her nose, and her lips.

484
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,153
You know what that is?

485
00:20:31,153 --> 00:20:31,986
- [Caleb] What?

486
00:20:31,986 --> 00:20:33,077
- Is that her dress?

487
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:34,577
- That's her foot.

488
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:38,113
- That's such a tiny foot.

489
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:38,946
- It is.

490
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,740
There's an arm and a hand.

491
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,275
- [Jeremy] So what do you
think about having a sister?

492
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,442
(screams)

493
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:49,828
- I love it, I'm gonna have two sisters.

494
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:51,911
- Change diapers for her.

495
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,260
I can cook.

496
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,096
- But I'll rather have a boy, I think.

497
00:20:57,096 --> 00:21:00,573
I'm most excited that
we're having another baby.

498
00:21:00,573 --> 00:21:01,576
- [Jeremy] Why?

499
00:21:01,576 --> 00:21:06,052
- Because then we can have
more kids in our family.

500
00:21:06,052 --> 00:21:08,552
We can like have more funness.

501
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:18,876
(thrilling music)

502
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:21,459
- [Kendra] Presenting Superman.

503
00:21:40,648 --> 00:21:41,981
- Superman wins.

504
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:45,942
- Okay now, rub 'em together.

505
00:21:52,877 --> 00:21:54,253
Time for tiaras.

506
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:56,836
(upbeat music)

507
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,900
Princess Elise.

508
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:17,269
You look so great, Elise.

509
00:22:19,707 --> 00:22:22,457
(ballroom music)

510
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,116
Here she is, Elsa.

511
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:40,699
- Princess Laura.

512
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:45,589
- [Jeremy] I've been keeping
track of her contractions.

513
00:22:45,589 --> 00:22:46,856
- Anytime, there is the possibility

514
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:48,319
of complications of pregnancy.

515
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:49,819
It's really scary.

516
00:22:51,962 --> 00:22:53,840
I've been feeling lots of cramping,

517
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,887
and like sharp pains,
and I finally was like,

518
00:22:56,887 --> 00:22:58,023
I just need to lay down.

519
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:00,583
So I laid down and then
I started tracking them.

520
00:23:00,583 --> 00:23:02,641
They were coming every
six to seven minutes.

521
00:23:02,641 --> 00:23:04,836
I was like, oh my goodness,
this is contractions.

522
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:06,028
I know what this is.

523
00:23:06,028 --> 00:23:07,287
But I shouldn't be having contractions

524
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:09,734
'cause I'm only 22 weeks
and four days pregnant.

525
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:14,041
So I called my doctor after
I've been like 45 minutes

526
00:23:14,041 --> 00:23:16,309
to an hour of this regularness.

527
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:18,736
They're wanting me to go into the hospital

528
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:21,207
to the labor and delivery
unit to be evaluated.

529
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:23,707
(piano music)

530
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,253
- We're checking in right now.

531
00:23:27,253 --> 00:23:28,719
- We're heading back to the
labor and delivery unit.

532
00:23:28,719 --> 00:23:30,693
Last time we're there
was when Laura was born.

533
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:32,341
- That's insane.

534
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:33,584
- But we're not birthing today,

535
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,911
we're just checking on the baby.

536
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:35,911
- Hopefully.

537
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,458
- Well, after monitoring me and the baby,

538
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,897
and my contractions for a while,

539
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:44,140
they checked me again
and I'm still not dilated

540
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,185
which is exactly the news
that we wanted to hear.

541
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:47,894
So they're gonna let me go home,

542
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:50,869
and hopefully the baby
stays inside until March,

543
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,378
when she's supposed to come out.

544
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:55,011
- Today, we're doing the
poopy diaper challenge.

545
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:57,488
- This one looks a little too real.

546
00:23:57,488 --> 00:23:59,571
(laughs)

547
00:24:03,007 --> 00:24:05,434
- We're going to smell
a diaper to figure out

548
00:24:05,434 --> 00:24:06,934
which candy it is.

549
00:24:09,565 --> 00:24:13,735
She might actually
trick us with real poop.

550
00:24:13,735 --> 00:24:14,856
- You know what,

551
00:24:14,856 --> 00:24:19,161
they might have had Laura
last night pooping them.

552
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,401
Yeah maybe.

553
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:23,060
- I mean big party in the microwave.

554
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,682
- We're like conspiracy parents.

555
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:28,875
- [Jeremy] The real
poopy diaper challenge.

556
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:31,460
- I know which one it is.

557
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,682
- I know.

558
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:35,228
- [Kendra] You can pick the
same one if you want to.

559
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:38,045
- [Caleb] I think it's Snickers.

560
00:24:38,045 --> 00:24:39,909
- [Jeremy] All right mum, which one it is?

561
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:41,992
- [Kendra] It's Snickers.

562
00:24:43,532 --> 00:24:44,919
- I had the chance for
the first time tonight

563
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:46,905
to put my hand on Kendra's belly,

564
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:50,261
and feel the baby moving inside.

565
00:24:50,261 --> 00:24:52,894
I'm just so happy that she's alive,

566
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:55,854
and I hope the everything
continues to go well

567
00:24:55,854 --> 00:24:57,854
for Kendra and the baby.

568
00:24:57,854 --> 00:25:01,402
- We're going to a doctor's
appointment for the baby

569
00:25:01,402 --> 00:25:04,012
and I'm very excited to see the baby,

570
00:25:04,012 --> 00:25:06,046
and hear it's heart beat.

571
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,726
- Well, it's really fun
to have Elise with me

572
00:25:07,726 --> 00:25:09,093
at my ultrasound appointment today.

573
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:11,315
I've never had any of my
kids at an ultrasound before.

574
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:13,457
So when the image like
popped up on the screen,

575
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:14,773
she's kind of confused at first.

576
00:25:14,773 --> 00:25:15,886
She's like it's just black and white.

577
00:25:15,886 --> 00:25:18,209
She's trying to describe
to her like what was what,

578
00:25:18,209 --> 00:25:21,225
and then the ultra stenographer
switched it over to 3D mode,

579
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:23,270
and we could see the baby's little face,

580
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,354
and Elise just got this
big smile on her face.

581
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:28,174
I was like, that's her,
like that's our baby.

582
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:29,391
That's your little sister.

583
00:25:29,391 --> 00:25:31,888
Just to feel the magic
of that moment together,

584
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:33,620
and then to be able to see her little face

585
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,497
makes me so excited.

586
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:38,120
(faint statements)

587
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,192
- [Jeremy] That's what babies do.

588
00:25:39,192 --> 00:25:41,324
They stick stuffs in their mouth.

589
00:25:41,324 --> 00:25:42,957
You're gonna have a baby sister again soon

590
00:25:42,957 --> 00:25:45,290
so you gotta get used to it.

591
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,537
Whatcha doing?

592
00:25:56,537 --> 00:25:57,632
- I'm building.

593
00:25:57,632 --> 00:26:00,328
- Oh, you're just building some stuff?

594
00:26:00,328 --> 00:26:01,753
- Yay.

595
00:26:01,753 --> 00:26:03,836
(laughs)

596
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:06,479
- Hi Jemma.

597
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:15,631
- [Jeremy] So you guys okay with the fact

598
00:26:15,631 --> 00:26:17,752
that we're having a little sister?

599
00:26:17,752 --> 00:26:18,595
- Yeah.

600
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:19,483
- [Jeremy] It's kind of like we're gonna

601
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:22,395
have a little Jemma soon.

602
00:26:22,395 --> 00:26:24,562
- She looks really strong.

603
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:28,249
- Look at those biceps.

604
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:29,416
Jemma go urgh.

605
00:26:32,638 --> 00:26:34,589
- So we had no idea but Laura and Jemma

606
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,422
have matching pajamas.

607
00:26:38,183 --> 00:26:41,303
- So now we have to take a picture.

608
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:42,787
♫ Shake your tail that is

609
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:44,272
♫ Shaking 'em down

610
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:47,379
♫ Flap those wings and turn around

611
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:51,256
♫ Boom, boom, boom, boom, grab your stuff

612
00:26:51,256 --> 00:26:54,821
♫ Sit back down, Tommy says enough

613
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,469
And the most common comment
that we're getting right now

614
00:26:57,469 --> 00:26:59,704
is what is your baby's name?

615
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:00,970
We don't know.

616
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,565
We do not have a name
for this little baby yet.

617
00:27:02,565 --> 00:27:04,684
I don't know why I'm
having such a hard time

618
00:27:04,684 --> 00:27:05,700
thinking a name.

619
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,846
- [Jeremy] So what are
you grateful for Caleb?

620
00:27:06,846 --> 00:27:08,490
- I'm grateful for that we gotta

621
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,882
have Thanksgiving all together.

622
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:12,840
- [Kendra] That's a good one.

623
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,169
- I'm grateful for sports that
we can play with each other,

624
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,715
and do fun stuff like that.

625
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:20,548
- Good one.

626
00:27:20,548 --> 00:27:23,763
I'm grateful for the prints--

627
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:25,664
(laughs)

628
00:27:25,664 --> 00:27:30,601
- [Kendra] His brother is on
the other side making faces.

629
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:33,184
- [Man In Specs] I would never.

630
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:42,121
- How can I be not grateful
for (noise drowns voice).

631
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:44,389
- I am grateful for the
seasons and the weather,

632
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:46,692
and the seasons of life,
and just, I don't know,

633
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,972
I'm just loving the beautiful
sunshine and weather today.

634
00:27:48,972 --> 00:27:50,889
- I'm grateful for art.

635
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,798
(upbeat music)

636
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:05,443
- [Kendra] All of these look so cute

637
00:28:05,443 --> 00:28:07,063
but check out these candy apples.

638
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:11,348
I've never seen candy apples
that look like that before.

639
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:14,724
- We just come here in the world.

640
00:28:14,724 --> 00:28:15,797
- [Kendra] Do you think my tummy's bigger

641
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,176
or Santa's tummy's bigger?

642
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:18,493
- [Children] Santa.

643
00:28:18,493 --> 00:28:19,808
- [Kendra] There we go.

644
00:28:19,808 --> 00:28:22,906
- But you have a bigger tummy (mumbles).

645
00:28:22,906 --> 00:28:24,052
- Well, thank you.

646
00:28:24,052 --> 00:28:25,246
Thank you, Caleb.

647
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:26,514
I can't see my toes anymore.

648
00:28:26,514 --> 00:28:27,764
There they are.

649
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,690
Well, baby's heartbeat is good and strong,

650
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,762
which wasn't a surprise
because she's super active

651
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:36,448
and moving all the time.

652
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,737
They actually told me I need
to get three shots today

653
00:28:38,737 --> 00:28:40,983
but I already got my blood
draw so that's behind me.

654
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:43,274
Three shots, I'm getting one in each arm

655
00:28:43,274 --> 00:28:45,441
and one in my bum, my bum.

656
00:28:46,465 --> 00:28:48,652
Guys, I just filmed that whole segment

657
00:28:48,652 --> 00:28:50,211
with a booger in my nose.

658
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:52,490
So we have to try that again.

659
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,866
Poor question for the day,
are you scared of needles?

660
00:28:55,866 --> 00:28:57,673
Me personally, I'm not scared of them.

661
00:28:57,673 --> 00:29:00,014
I don't necessarily enjoy getting shots.

662
00:29:00,014 --> 00:29:01,999
I don't know anybody
that actually likes that

663
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,999
but it's not a big deal to me.

664
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:04,179
I was a nurse, I gave shots.

665
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:07,508
I'm not scared or nervous
around blood draws or needles.

666
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:10,008
(merry tunes)

667
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,114
We decided to try something new this year,

668
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:21,570
and have a kids Christmas party.

669
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,151
There's 14 kids, and
it's gonna be mass chaos

670
00:29:24,151 --> 00:29:25,575
but it's gonna be awesome.

671
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:28,294
Well, Laura just threw up
all over the living room,

672
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:31,392
and I think that about
does us in for the day.

673
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:33,900
We are officially postponing Christmas.

674
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,035
The kids are bummed to not
be opening their presents

675
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:39,496
but honestly, they're all
just laying here, listlessly.

676
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:42,729
So we were going to do Christmas tomorrow

677
00:29:42,729 --> 00:29:44,336
so let's see you guys
for Christmas tomorrow.

678
00:29:44,336 --> 00:29:46,193
Hope you're having a better
Christmas than ours today.

679
00:29:46,193 --> 00:29:47,552
- Where?

680
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,857
- [Kendra] You want to
know where we're going?

681
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:49,992
- Yeah.

682
00:29:49,992 --> 00:29:51,821
- Okay, so what do we know?

683
00:29:51,821 --> 00:29:53,026
- Well, we're going--

684
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:54,414
- We're going on a trip.

685
00:29:54,414 --> 00:29:55,976
- With grandma and papa.

686
00:29:55,976 --> 00:30:00,143
- And we're, in January, and
we're traveling on an airplane.

687
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,641
- All right but where are we going?

688
00:30:03,641 --> 00:30:05,030
- Maybe to Arizona?

689
00:30:05,030 --> 00:30:07,016
- Let's open it.

690
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:08,599
Where are we going?

691
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:13,038
- [Children] Disneyland, yeah.

692
00:30:17,245 --> 00:30:19,341
- In California or in Florida?

693
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:21,049
- [Kendra] California, Disneyland.

694
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,135
- [Isaac] Yeah.

695
00:30:22,135 --> 00:30:24,681
- Look mum, there are two here.

696
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:26,264
- Disneyland, yeah.

697
00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:36,296
(magical music)

698
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:39,641
- [Jeremy] Say Disney.

699
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:41,308
- [Children] Disney.

700
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:44,639
- Can I go on the trip with you guys?

701
00:30:44,639 --> 00:30:46,478
- [Kendra] Yeah, we're
gonna all go on a trip.

702
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:50,061
- [All] 13, 12, seven,
six, five, two, one.

703
00:30:52,733 --> 00:30:53,566
- 2017.

704
00:30:54,475 --> 00:30:56,725
(clanking)

705
00:31:07,005 --> 00:31:09,172
(blaring)

706
00:31:24,634 --> 00:31:25,975
We almost left that.

707
00:31:25,975 --> 00:31:26,808
- Yeah.

708
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,265
- [Children] Disneyland.

709
00:31:34,176 --> 00:31:36,363
- I'm so glad to be able to fly.

710
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:37,704
- [Kendra] Me too.

711
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:38,977
- We almost did.

712
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:40,451
- [Kendra] Are you excited to fly?

713
00:31:40,451 --> 00:31:42,368
- Yeah, it's a mystery.

714
00:31:44,137 --> 00:31:45,316
- [Kendra] I don't think it's a mystery.

715
00:31:45,316 --> 00:31:47,795
I think it's gonna be fun.

716
00:31:47,795 --> 00:31:50,545
(faint chatters)

717
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,392
- Yay.

718
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,494
- We're in the air.

719
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:04,327
- Yeah.

720
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,119
- Well we just got in a car accident,

721
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:09,772
and I'm still like all shakey and--

722
00:32:09,772 --> 00:32:11,366
- [Laura] I think it's so sad.

723
00:32:11,366 --> 00:32:12,564
- It is so sad.

724
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:15,231
- He is gonna say so much sorry.

725
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:18,030
- So we are taking my kids to the ocean

726
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,655
for the very first time today,

727
00:32:19,655 --> 00:32:22,999
and I'm so excited to live
these moments with them.

728
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:25,112
It's just magical.

729
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:27,279
What do you think of this?

730
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:32,861
- It's like the whole entire part of just

731
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:35,863
the part that the water comes on.

732
00:32:35,863 --> 00:32:37,449
- It's called the beach.

733
00:32:37,449 --> 00:32:39,752
I'm so happy to be here.

734
00:32:39,752 --> 00:32:41,752
- [Jeremy] Jump and run.

735
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:46,778
(faint statement)

736
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:49,020
- [Elise] I'm scared.

737
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,020
- Oh, wait for the waves to come in.

738
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:56,359
(screams)

739
00:32:56,359 --> 00:32:57,955
(faint statements)

740
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,832
Here it comes.

741
00:32:59,832 --> 00:33:01,999
(screams)

742
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:10,982
Here it comes.

743
00:33:17,775 --> 00:33:19,108
This is awesome.

744
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:26,178
Well, we're ready.

745
00:33:26,178 --> 00:33:28,271
Today is the day, and
we're headed to Disneyland

746
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,563
with our Mickey Mouse ears.

747
00:33:30,563 --> 00:33:33,342
- I gonna see the castle.

748
00:33:33,342 --> 00:33:34,610
- [Kendra] You're gonna see the castle?

749
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,360
- Yes, to Disneyland.

750
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:41,484
- [Jeremy] Come on.

751
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,710
You're excited.

752
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:50,277
- Hi Minnie.

753
00:33:50,277 --> 00:33:51,967
- I've never been to
Disneyland, and I had no idea

754
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,701
it looks like this in here.

755
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,118
- There's a castle, a castle.

756
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,661
- Yeah, Disneyland.

757
00:34:05,867 --> 00:34:08,074
We're literally at the castle.

758
00:34:08,074 --> 00:34:11,123
- [Jeremy] We're literally at the castle.

759
00:34:11,123 --> 00:34:13,568
- I see one over there,

760
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:16,069
and on the leaves, over there.

761
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:22,509
We're at the castle.

762
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:24,342
- We're at the castle.

763
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:27,860
- Okay, let's take a picture.

764
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,331
Are you going inside the castle?

765
00:34:30,331 --> 00:34:31,659
- Yeah.

766
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,242
(upbeat music)

767
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:52,250
- We made it, we're at Kansas City.

768
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,000
Everybody put your hands in.

769
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,194
Ready, I'm gonna see if
we can stand altogether.

770
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,434
Hold hands.

771
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:58,767
Ready, one, two.

772
00:35:04,649 --> 00:35:06,633
- [Jeremy] There we go, you got it.

773
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,070
- We thought it'll be fun
to ask each of the kids

774
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,486
what they think we should name the baby.

775
00:35:09,486 --> 00:35:11,548
I want these memories
for the memory books.

776
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:13,532
What do you think we should name the baby?

777
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:14,365
- A star.

778
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:16,532
- [Kendra] Star?

779
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,604
You think we should name her Baby Star?

780
00:35:18,604 --> 00:35:19,726
- Yeah.

781
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:20,559
- [Kendra] That's a good idea.

782
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:22,932
What other name ideas do you have for us?

783
00:35:22,932 --> 00:35:24,518
- A lot.

784
00:35:24,518 --> 00:35:26,006
- [Kendra] Like?

785
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:28,088
- Maybe Audrey?

786
00:35:28,088 --> 00:35:29,255
Maybe Melanie.

787
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:34,638
- I think it's Emily or Sarah, or--

788
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:43,763
- I can't say that word.

789
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:46,813
- I like a Rachel and Olivia.

790
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:48,924
- [Kendra] What do you think
we should name the baby?

791
00:35:48,924 --> 00:35:50,257
- Indiana Jones.

792
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:53,225
- [Jeremy] Indiana Jones?

793
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:54,639
- [Kendra] I think that was Indiana Jones.

794
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:57,809
- [Jeremy] Okay, we'll consider it.

795
00:35:57,809 --> 00:35:58,642
- Bye.

796
00:36:01,504 --> 00:36:04,356
The kids are finally all
asleep, I think, I hope.

797
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:05,189
- They're gone.

798
00:36:05,189 --> 00:36:06,380
I actually just saw Elise

799
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,355
is awake still.
- Sorry, my nose, it's just--

800
00:36:08,355 --> 00:36:10,243
Okay, thank you, that feels--

801
00:36:10,243 --> 00:36:12,159
- That made my nose itch.

802
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,116
- So does your nose itch 'cause of it?

803
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:15,359
It's like a smile, it's contagious.

804
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,192
- Or yawn.

805
00:36:16,192 --> 00:36:17,696
Why I know you guys have
been very interested in

806
00:36:17,696 --> 00:36:19,002
what we're gonna name our new baby.

807
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,430
I'm really interested too.

808
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,844
We just haven't decided yet.

809
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:24,707
So while these are our
top five names right now,

810
00:36:24,707 --> 00:36:28,682
but it doesn't mean that this
is for sure gonna be her name.

811
00:36:28,682 --> 00:36:30,303
This is just our top five picks right now.

812
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:31,940
I've been known to change my mind before.

813
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,498
Here they are in no particular order.

814
00:36:35,498 --> 00:36:38,595
The names we're thinking about are Julia.

815
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:39,681
You want me to say more?

816
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:40,788
- We could rotate.

817
00:36:40,788 --> 00:36:43,300
- Okay, then you go next.

818
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,385
- In second, well it's not in an order so.

819
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:48,552
The second name is Nicole.

820
00:36:50,359 --> 00:36:52,776
- I don't remember the names.

821
00:36:55,124 --> 00:36:55,957
- Audrey.

822
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,928
- Janei.

823
00:36:57,928 --> 00:36:59,382
- Or Marie.

824
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:00,306
Marie?

825
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:02,103
- We like that, I didn't know.

826
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:02,936
- Is it Melissa?

827
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:03,769
- It was Melissa.

828
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,653
- [Both] Melissa. (laughs)

829
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:07,534
- [Kendra] Is this it?

830
00:37:07,534 --> 00:37:08,844
- Can I press the button?

831
00:37:08,844 --> 00:37:11,261
- [Kendra] Of course you can.

832
00:37:12,705 --> 00:37:14,516
Oh you can do it.

833
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:16,372
There you go, you got it.

834
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:19,222
Hey, Ms. Laura, where are we going?

835
00:37:19,222 --> 00:37:20,803
- At the doctor.

836
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:22,850
- [Kendra] What's the doctor gonna check?

837
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,767
- The baby.

838
00:37:25,591 --> 00:37:27,267
- [Kendra] Do you want
to press the next button?

839
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,100
- Sure.

840
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,766
- Keep pressing number two.

841
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:31,599
Good job.

842
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:35,181
Laura is coming with me to
my doctor's appointment.

843
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:37,486
She is really excited to
hear the baby's heartbeat.

844
00:37:37,486 --> 00:37:40,460
Hey Ms. Laura, did you put
your own shoes on today?

845
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,307
- Yeah, it's fun.

846
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,343
- [Kendra] Yeap, good job.

847
00:37:44,343 --> 00:37:46,426
Okay, this way good girl.

848
00:37:50,188 --> 00:37:52,188
It's your little sister.

849
00:37:56,178 --> 00:37:57,950
Six weeks left.

850
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,783
It's gonna go by fast.

851
00:38:00,674 --> 00:38:03,170
Look at you skipping.

852
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,253
- Dishwasher?

853
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:07,382
- Well I'm headed into a
counseling appointment,

854
00:38:07,382 --> 00:38:09,144
and I'm really looking forward to it.

855
00:38:09,144 --> 00:38:11,317
As I told you guys before,
I struggled with anxiety

856
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:14,392
and depression, and I also
struggled after each baby

857
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,270
was some postpartum depression.

858
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,605
So Jeremy and I talked about it,

859
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:19,525
and we decided to have
me do some counseling

860
00:38:19,525 --> 00:38:21,261
before this baby's born.

861
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:24,295
Kind of to have that relationship in place

862
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:26,066
with the counselor to be ready

863
00:38:26,066 --> 00:38:29,401
to help me prepare to
deal with the emotions,

864
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:32,728
and also hopefully to be
ready in case I am struggling

865
00:38:32,728 --> 00:38:34,500
that I can have those resources in place,

866
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,995
and ready to have that help.

867
00:38:35,995 --> 00:38:38,759
All right, well I'm
definitely starting to nest.

868
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:41,127
That means wanting to get
my house completely ready

869
00:38:41,127 --> 00:38:43,077
and organized, and clean, and wonderful

870
00:38:43,077 --> 00:38:45,394
to welcome a new baby into it.

871
00:38:45,394 --> 00:38:49,639
Today, I am tackling my
junk drawer in my bathroom.

872
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:52,421
This is ridiculous, and I've
already taken some stuff out.

873
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,335
So instead of getting
overwhelmed, I'm trying to tackle

874
00:38:55,335 --> 00:38:57,447
small projects each day.

875
00:38:57,447 --> 00:38:59,239
This is my small project today

876
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:02,290
but I'm already overwhelmed.

877
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:03,301
- So there's a lot of baby stuff

878
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:04,368
that we're needing to get still.

879
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:05,951
- Cute little baby.

880
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:10,651
- That's a baby seat.

881
00:39:11,526 --> 00:39:13,297
This is a baby seat.

882
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:16,355
This is a baby seat, mummy.

883
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:17,669
- [Kendra] Is that a baby seat?

884
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,586
- Everything's so tiny.

885
00:39:21,039 --> 00:39:23,622
- Look guys, did you see these?

886
00:39:27,128 --> 00:39:30,168
The new dress are really nice.

887
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,001
Oh, that's for a baby?

888
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:38,022
(upbeat music)

889
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:51,534
- Oh my God, that one's so adorable.

890
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:53,240
- [Laura] This one's so adorable.

891
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,137
- You think this one is
good for a little girl?

892
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:57,879
We already have a swing
that all of you use.

893
00:39:57,879 --> 00:40:00,655
So she's gonna get to use the
same one as everyone else.

894
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,170
- [Jeremy] The jungle themed one.

895
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,806
- Yes, buy it for your first
kid, use it for everybody.

896
00:40:06,806 --> 00:40:08,139
- It's homemade.

897
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:10,972
- We already have this stuff.

898
00:40:10,972 --> 00:40:13,404
But this being our fifth
baby, we obviously have almost

899
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:14,441
everything that we need,

900
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:16,573
and we're trying to reuse
as much as possible.

901
00:40:16,573 --> 00:40:18,366
She's gonna be in the same crib as all

902
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:19,740
of her brothers and sisters have been.

903
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,468
She'll use the same
swing, the same bouncer

904
00:40:21,468 --> 00:40:23,955
but there are a few things
that you have to upgrade.

905
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:27,965
It's kinda nice to get a
few new things for a baby.

906
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:29,965
- A stroller for a baby.

907
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:35,036
Oh daddy, here, this one right there.

908
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:37,831
Let's find the pink one.

909
00:40:37,831 --> 00:40:39,998
No pink ones, no pink one.

910
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:43,091
There's a pink one.

911
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,852
- [Jeremy] You found a pink stroller.

912
00:40:45,852 --> 00:40:47,352
- It's for a baby.

913
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:55,047
- So the car seat that we
used with Laura is expired

914
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:57,242
so we're needing to get
a new infant car seat

915
00:40:57,242 --> 00:40:58,451
for this new baby girl.

916
00:40:58,451 --> 00:40:59,417
It's so overwhelming.

917
00:40:59,417 --> 00:41:01,054
I feel like technology changes so quickly.

918
00:41:01,054 --> 00:41:02,428
I've been to figure out the differences

919
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:03,889
between all of 'em and what we need.

920
00:41:03,889 --> 00:41:06,022
We've always done Graco Car Seats

921
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:09,587
and so I've just narrowed
down my hunt to the Gracos.

922
00:41:09,587 --> 00:41:10,675
- [Jeremy] Not sponsored.

923
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:12,671
- Not sponsored.

924
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:16,754
So I'm just trying to
figure out the differences.

925
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:20,660
- A crib.

926
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,540
- I'm having a hard time
keeping up with Laura.

927
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,124
She's so excited to be
here with other baby stuff.

928
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:34,957
- Oh look.

929
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,458
Chair, no way.

930
00:41:44,876 --> 00:41:48,276
Look at all the shoes for a baby.

931
00:41:48,276 --> 00:41:49,109
No way.

932
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:54,471
Oh look. (screams)

933
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,971
Boots, for a baby?

934
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,056
Oh, flowers.

935
00:42:02,298 --> 00:42:05,356
- So I'm wanting to get a
couple new outfits for her.

936
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,328
She definitely needs a coming-home outfit.

937
00:42:07,328 --> 00:42:09,038
I just haven't found the right thing yet.

938
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:12,465
There's so much cuteness though.

939
00:42:12,465 --> 00:42:14,298
This makes me excited.

940
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:33,077
We found a love seat rocker.

941
00:42:33,077 --> 00:42:35,407
That's what we need in our room.

942
00:42:35,407 --> 00:42:37,650
That way we can both
rock the baby at night.

943
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,233
- I love this rock.

944
00:42:40,172 --> 00:42:42,356
- Ah, this is comfy.

945
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:44,143
- Where's Laura?

946
00:42:44,143 --> 00:42:46,243
- I'm right here, rocking in my own chair.

947
00:42:46,243 --> 00:42:48,373
- [Kendra] Rocking in my own chair, dad.

948
00:42:48,373 --> 00:42:50,237
- I'm gonna rock with you guys.

949
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:51,372
- [Kendra] Is there room for mum?

950
00:42:51,372 --> 00:42:52,773
- Bring it on.

951
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:54,858
- Sit on me, mum.

952
00:42:54,858 --> 00:42:56,798
- Crush the little people.

953
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:59,358
- Well, it's been fun to see
the kids' excitement here.

954
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:01,089
I think it's safe to say
that we're all excited

955
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:02,002
for this new baby.

956
00:43:02,002 --> 00:43:04,367
I am 35 weeks pregnant.

957
00:43:04,367 --> 00:43:05,966
That means the countdown is on.

958
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,133
There's only four or five more weeks left

959
00:43:08,133 --> 00:43:11,890
until this baby comes, and we're excited.

960
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,508
- Come on little chicken.

961
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,675
(gasping)

962
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,349
- Grow, little bird.

963
00:43:24,492 --> 00:43:25,394
- It made it out.

964
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:29,407
Did you guys see how wet the feathers are?

965
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,904
- [Elise] It's so adorable.

966
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:32,737
- [Kendra] Yeah, this is already

967
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:34,831
gonna be the next one to hatch.

968
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:37,133
- [Elise] I can see that she's moving.

969
00:43:37,133 --> 00:43:39,352
- [Kendra] She really can hatch this.

970
00:43:39,352 --> 00:43:41,421
So we're sitting here reading the book,

971
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,703
and we're watching our little baby sister

972
00:43:43,703 --> 00:43:45,664
kick all over the place.

973
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,977
She was moving so much.

974
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:49,237
Of course now I turned on the camera,

975
00:43:49,237 --> 00:43:51,237
and she's holding still.

976
00:43:52,407 --> 00:43:55,002
- [Elise] Maybe she just likes hearing

977
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:56,297
her brothers and sisters.

978
00:43:56,297 --> 00:43:57,565
- [Isaac] She's kicking.

979
00:43:57,565 --> 00:43:59,091
- [Caleb] Hi.

980
00:43:59,091 --> 00:44:00,717
- [Elise] Don't hurt the baby.

981
00:44:00,717 --> 00:44:02,019
- You're so nice Caleb.

982
00:44:02,019 --> 00:44:04,286
Anyways, so when the first
chick hatched this morning,

983
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:06,069
Laura came into my room and she goes,

984
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:08,775
"Mum, is the baby gonna hatch today?"

985
00:44:08,775 --> 00:44:10,311
I was like, no the baby's not hatching.

986
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:13,773
She's like, "When it hatches,
does it poke your tummy,

987
00:44:13,773 --> 00:44:14,992
"and crawl out?"

988
00:44:14,992 --> 00:44:18,137
I said, no babies are born a different way

989
00:44:18,137 --> 00:44:19,012
but it was really cute.

990
00:44:19,012 --> 00:44:20,329
Do you want to come
inside with me and look

991
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:21,549
at the baby girl clothes?

992
00:44:21,549 --> 00:44:22,382
- Yeah.

993
00:44:22,382 --> 00:44:23,369
- [Kendra] Do you want to?

994
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,010
What are you gonna do with them?

995
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:26,197
- Open it.

996
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:27,182
- [Kendra] Open it?

997
00:44:27,182 --> 00:44:29,206
- But I can't, it's too hard.

998
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:30,147
- [Kendra] Well, I'll help you open it.

999
00:44:30,147 --> 00:44:32,780
Then we'll look at the
baby girl clothes together.

1000
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:36,086
Who are the baby girl clothes for, Laura?

1001
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:37,775
- Baby girl.

1002
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,764
- [Kendra] For baby
girl, this baby girl huh.

1003
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:43,911
- I think he loves me.

1004
00:44:43,911 --> 00:44:45,159
- [Elise] I feel like the baby kick

1005
00:44:45,159 --> 00:44:47,130
used to be a little bigger.

1006
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,665
- I think I love her.

1007
00:44:48,665 --> 00:44:51,173
- [Kendra] Oh, I know you love her.

1008
00:44:51,173 --> 00:44:52,668
- And I can touch her.

1009
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:53,855
- Yeah.

1010
00:44:53,855 --> 00:44:55,724
- And I can lay with her.

1011
00:44:55,724 --> 00:44:59,189
- Oh, you can't lay on
her when she's born.

1012
00:44:59,189 --> 00:45:01,439
(smooches)

1013
00:45:02,916 --> 00:45:04,988
Spontaneous cuteness.

1014
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:05,821
You guys are awesome.

1015
00:45:05,821 --> 00:45:08,932
Okay, let's go look at
the baby girl clothes.

1016
00:45:08,932 --> 00:45:10,822
You want to come look at the
baby girl clothes with us?

1017
00:45:10,822 --> 00:45:13,269
So I found the newborn girl box yesterday.

1018
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:15,446
Now I haven't had a chance
to go through it yet

1019
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,051
but I thought it'll
fun for Elise and Laura

1020
00:45:17,051 --> 00:45:17,884
to go through it with me

1021
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:19,437
because you guys wore all these clothes.

1022
00:45:19,437 --> 00:45:20,686
- Yeah.

1023
00:45:20,686 --> 00:45:22,334
- When I was a baby.

1024
00:45:22,334 --> 00:45:23,663
- Yes, when you were a baby.

1025
00:45:23,663 --> 00:45:26,589
Look, these are you guys'
blankets and burp cloths,

1026
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:28,322
and your swimsuit.

1027
00:45:28,322 --> 00:45:31,155
(faint statement)

1028
00:45:32,179 --> 00:45:33,762
- It's roo-bum-bum.

1029
00:45:35,118 --> 00:45:36,661
- Oh look, these are clothes for baby.

1030
00:45:36,661 --> 00:45:38,041
- Yeah, that's a dress.

1031
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:40,500
- The baby smell like drool.

1032
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,417
They drool.

1033
00:45:42,277 --> 00:45:44,035
- They do sometimes, we
have to give them baths.

1034
00:45:44,035 --> 00:45:45,112
- It doesn't fit me.

1035
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,180
- This doesn't fit you.

1036
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,322
- This is for the spit.

1037
00:45:48,322 --> 00:45:49,999
- That is for the spit, okay.

1038
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:52,690
This is a nursing cover.

1039
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,844
These ones are gonna gets.

1040
00:45:54,844 --> 00:45:56,042
- Is this for the car seats?

1041
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:57,790
- Yeah, that one goes over the car seat.

1042
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,957
- Oh, I love this blanket.

1043
00:46:01,255 --> 00:46:03,621
- I love this blanket too.

1044
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:04,515
- Those ones are special.

1045
00:46:04,515 --> 00:46:05,856
Those are your blessing blankets.

1046
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:07,208
- These are so cute.

1047
00:46:07,208 --> 00:46:09,403
- This is your blessing dress for church.

1048
00:46:09,403 --> 00:46:10,703
Do you guys want to get out the bracelet?

1049
00:46:10,703 --> 00:46:13,036
(baby talk)

1050
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:14,990
- For a baby.

1051
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,724
- These are our little baby girl's shoes.

1052
00:46:18,724 --> 00:46:20,525
- These are cool.

1053
00:46:20,525 --> 00:46:23,692
- Yeah, aren't they cool little shoes.

1054
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:33,645
Well, I just completely
melted down, stopping.

1055
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,387
- [Jeremy] The kids are watching
mum getting her pictures.

1056
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:47,154
- [Photographer] You want
to say anything to the baby?

1057
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:51,738
Can you give the baby a kiss?

1058
00:46:53,515 --> 00:46:54,895
Oh, how cute you are.

1059
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,400
Okay, look at each other.

1060
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,733
- Look at mummy.

1061
00:47:00,687 --> 00:47:02,770
(laughs)

1062
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:18,822
All right, well I'm excited
to see the maternity pictures

1063
00:47:18,822 --> 00:47:20,009
when we get them back.

1064
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:22,052
I think that worked
pretty well so thank you.

1065
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:22,885
- Yeah, absolutely.

1066
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:23,718
- We're gonna be--

1067
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:26,786
Okay, that was like the most
awkward on-camera thing ever.

1068
00:47:26,786 --> 00:47:28,186
Turn it off.

1069
00:47:28,186 --> 00:47:29,861
That's called nursing pads.

1070
00:47:29,861 --> 00:47:31,313
Those are for the mummies.

1071
00:47:31,313 --> 00:47:34,933
- Here's the poopy diaper challenge.

1072
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:38,016
(enlightening music)

1073
00:47:40,651 --> 00:47:42,116
- [Kendra] All right, if
you are watching this video,

1074
00:47:42,116 --> 00:47:44,451
it means that I am in labor.

1075
00:47:44,451 --> 00:47:47,663
That's crazy that that's
actually happening now.

1076
00:47:47,663 --> 00:47:50,851
So if you want real time
updates of what's going on,

1077
00:47:50,851 --> 00:47:52,702
you can head over to J House Vlogs

1078
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:54,684
on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

1079
00:47:54,684 --> 00:00:00,000
We'll be updating there first.
