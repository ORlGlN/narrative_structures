1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,022
- Hi, guys.

2
00:00:01,022 --> 00:00:02,061
This is Kendra from J House.

3
00:00:02,061 --> 00:00:03,786
I'm here with another library haul.

4
00:00:03,786 --> 00:00:05,439
This one's a fall haul.

5
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:06,596
Oh, so festive.

6
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:09,250
I realize this is more
of a pick of the stack

7
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,832
set up that I've got going
on rather than library haul

8
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:14,326
because I'm showing you our favorite books

9
00:00:14,326 --> 00:00:16,711
from the library, not just
everything that we brought home.

10
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,294
So let's get to it.

11
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,393
This is called Sophie's Squash,

12
00:00:21,393 --> 00:00:23,202
and it is the story of a little girl

13
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:26,797
that falls in love with
this little squash.

14
00:00:26,797 --> 00:00:28,164
Essentially it's her little baby doll

15
00:00:28,164 --> 00:00:30,371
and she takes care of it, and takes it

16
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:33,103
everywhere with her,
and she just adores it.

17
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:36,303
I mean to see a little
girl playing with a squash,

18
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,674
it's just beautiful to
see her imaginations.

19
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:40,120
It makes me want to get out a potato

20
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,941
and hand it to my kids and see if they

21
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,050
will enjoy playing with it.

22
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,057
- It was snowing

23
00:00:46,057 --> 00:00:48,974
and it growed a big, big, big bush!

24
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,830
And it had two squashes, see?

25
00:00:58,857 --> 00:00:59,940
- Let me see.

26
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:04,548
Anyway, the next one is The Ugly Pumpkin

27
00:01:04,548 --> 00:01:07,566
by Dave Horowitz, and this is the story

28
00:01:07,566 --> 00:01:10,646
of a pumpkin that is
sitting in the pumpkin patch

29
00:01:10,646 --> 00:01:11,595
and nobody will choose him

30
00:01:11,595 --> 00:01:12,990
and he feels different and weird.

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,259
It's an Ugly Duckling story essentially

32
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:16,297
because at the end of the story,

33
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:20,033
he realizes that he's not an
ugly pumpkin, he's a squash.

34
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:23,315
So I guess it's actually kind
of a gearing from Halloween

35
00:01:23,315 --> 00:01:24,791
to Thanksgiving book.

36
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,570
It's a nice crossover one for that.

37
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,481
This is Fletcher and the Falling Leaves

38
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:31,046
by Julia Rawlinson, and
it's the sweet story

39
00:01:31,046 --> 00:01:33,430
of a little fox, who
it's his first winter,

40
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,309
and his favorite tree
seems to be getting sick,

41
00:01:36,309 --> 00:01:37,607
and the leaves are changing color,

42
00:01:37,607 --> 00:01:39,637
and they're falling off,
and he tries to save

43
00:01:39,637 --> 00:01:42,090
the leaves and hold them on tight,

44
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,982
and he learns about fall and what it is.

45
00:01:45,982 --> 00:01:50,149
- But the wolf said, "Don't
worry, I'll catch you."

46
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:54,300
- [Kendra] Aw, the wolf said,
"Don't worry, I'll catch you?"

47
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,467
- Yeah, and the different
one's changing different colors

48
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:04,519
and they did it super colors
and this how it did it.

49
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,806
- The other one that I have about leaves

50
00:02:06,806 --> 00:02:10,044
is called The Little Yellow
Leaf by Carin Berger.

51
00:02:10,044 --> 00:02:13,360
So this is the story of a last leaf.

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,209
It's a tree that's standing there

53
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:17,694
and it's got one little leaf hanging on

54
00:02:17,694 --> 00:02:20,525
and it doesn't want to go,
it's not ready to fall off

55
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,106
and have it be wintertime yet.

56
00:02:22,106 --> 00:02:23,890
And what I loved about these leaf books

57
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,017
is that they inspire so many activities.

58
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:27,804
We went out and we did a leaf hunt,

59
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:30,196
and we did leaf rubbings,
and we made a leaf collage,

60
00:02:30,196 --> 00:02:32,135
and we were driving along in the car

61
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,885
and we would look at the
trees, and we would notice

62
00:02:34,885 --> 00:02:37,560
how many leaves were left.

63
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,232
There was one particular
tree that only had

64
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,043
a few leaves left on it,
and Elise squeezed my arm

65
00:02:42,043 --> 00:02:44,408
and said, "Look, mom, that little leaf

66
00:02:44,408 --> 00:02:45,845
"doesn't want to let go yet,"

67
00:02:45,845 --> 00:02:47,130
and I thought that was so sweet.

68
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,266
Another fall theme that
I really enjoy is apples.

69
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:54,433
So we have The Apple Pie that
Papa Baked by Lauren Thompson,

70
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:58,429
and it is a very fun repeating text.

71
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:02,596
"This is the pie, warm and
sweet, that Papa baked.

72
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:04,012
"These are the apples, juicy and red,

73
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:06,940
"that went in the pie, warm
and sweet, that Papa baked."

74
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,038
It's the story of
recognizing kind of where

75
00:03:09,038 --> 00:03:09,940
things come from.

76
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,276
Your apple pie is warm and delicious

77
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,682
because it came from the apples,

78
00:03:12,682 --> 00:03:13,997
and the apples came from the tree,

79
00:03:13,997 --> 00:03:15,650
and the tree grew because of the roots,

80
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,333
and the roots grew because of the sun.

81
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:20,222
Another apple book that
my kids really like,

82
00:03:20,222 --> 00:03:23,807
it's oddly simple, but my kids love it.

83
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:27,220
So it's Apple Farmer Annie
by Monica Wellington.

84
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,316
- This is applesauce.

85
00:03:29,316 --> 00:03:30,583
- [Kendra] Woah.

86
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,541
- And she's busy making it
and that's the apple pie.

87
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:38,708
- My boy Isaac loves football,
so we have The Family Huddle.

88
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:43,560
It's by Peyton Manning, Eli
Manning, and Archie Manning.

89
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,460
If you have a child that's into football,

90
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,350
it's definitely a must-read.

91
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,109
- I like that it has my
favorite football player,

92
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:52,379
Peyton Manning.

93
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,367
- [Kendra] This is your favorite part?

94
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,358
- This page.

95
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:55,377
- [Kendra] Why?

96
00:03:55,377 --> 00:03:57,960
- Because they score a touchdown.

97
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,148
- And the last book that
I just couldn't leave out

98
00:04:00,148 --> 00:04:01,732
is not a seasonal book at all.

99
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:02,993
This is called The Looking Book

100
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:04,217
and you guys need to check it out.

101
00:04:04,217 --> 00:04:07,365
Is the story of some
boys that did not want

102
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,770
to go outside and play.

103
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,937
I'm sure all of us moms can relate.

104
00:04:09,937 --> 00:04:12,027
"Turn off that TV, go outside and play."

105
00:04:12,027 --> 00:04:14,066
And so to solve the
problem of them not wanting

106
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:15,909
to go outside, she gives them lookers.

107
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:17,250
See that?

108
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,995
Special glasses that
they can use to go out

109
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:21,962
and see the world with.

110
00:04:21,963 --> 00:04:23,518
With the glasses on, all of a sudden,

111
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,566
the world is interesting and they discover

112
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:27,567
all sorts of fun things outside,

113
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,964
and I just love that it was a good example

114
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:31,705
of getting kids into
nature and helping them

115
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,911
notice things that they
didn't notice before.

116
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:36,307
I keep meaning to go to the
Dollar Store or somewhere

117
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:37,831
and get some glasses like that,

118
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:40,086
and give the kids the
glasses, and read this book.

119
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,245
That would be a great activity.

120
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:42,078
You should do it.

121
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:44,414
So there we have it: our library haul.

122
00:04:44,414 --> 00:04:46,253
Coming up we have the Thanksgiving haul

123
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,351
and I'm super excited.

124
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,945
I've been getting the
books on hold this week,

125
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,855
and so I've been looking through them.

126
00:04:50,855 --> 00:04:53,152
Thanksgiving is my
absolute favorite holiday,

127
00:04:53,152 --> 00:04:55,498
and I just love Thanksgiving books,

128
00:04:55,498 --> 00:04:57,310
especially Thanksgiving picture books.

129
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,767
There's some real winners in there

130
00:04:58,767 --> 00:05:00,013
that I'm gonna tell you
guys about next week,

131
00:05:00,013 --> 00:05:01,158
and then you have to put on hold

132
00:05:01,158 --> 00:05:02,895
and take them home and
read them to your children

133
00:05:02,895 --> 00:00:00,000
because it is just magical.
