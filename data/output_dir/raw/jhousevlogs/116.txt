13
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:36,975
cleaned out so now I'm just making dinner

14
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:39,030
and putting it inside the
pumpkin so that it can bake.

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,585
So what do you say when
you trick-or-treat?

16
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:43,312
- I say, trick-or-treat it's Halloween.

17
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,145
- [Kendra] And then what happens

18
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:45,247
after you say trick-or-treat?

19
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:46,719
- You get candy.

20
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,039

21
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:49,663

23
00:00:52,022 --> 00:00:54,103
They give you the candy

24
00:00:54,103 --> 00:00:55,087
- Say thank you.

25
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:57,327

26
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:59,957
- And eat, one piece of candy.

27
00:00:59,957 --> 00:01:01,721
- Good plan, Laura's been asking

28
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,167

She finally has on just

(peppy music)

34
00:01:16,152 --> 00:01:18,864
Here's the chili, so now

00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:23,031
in the pumpkin and then we
bake it, uh oh is right.

36
00:01:23,972 --> 00:01:28,222
- Oh got guts in there,
that will get it dirty.

37
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,086
- [Kendra] It's done.

38
00:01:29,086 --> 00:01:30,670
- It's a big pumpkin.

39
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,686

40
00:01:32,686 --> 00:01:33,519

49
00:01:48,636 --> 00:01:49,526
- Yeah.

50
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,359
- [Jeremy] That's why we don't have

51
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,388
you in your costume yet.

52
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:53,971
(upbeat music)

53
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,504
(Jeremy laughing)

54
00:02:00,892 --> 00:02:04,142
- [Kendra] Let's go get your hair done.

55
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:09,424
- (mumbles) getting my hair curled.

56
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:10,800
- [Jeremy] Why are you curling your hair?

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,094
- Because I'm gonna be
Moana for Halloween.

58
00:02:13,094 --> 00:02:15,096

59
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:16,657
- I'm way different since I have

61
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:20,616
- [Kendra] Does it look different?

62
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,449
- Yeah.

63
00:02:21,449 --> 00:02:22,832
- And should we put
some makeup on you too?

64
00:02:22,832 --> 00:02:23,758
- Sure.

65
00:02:23,758 --> 00:02:26,258
(peppy music)

66
00:02:34,996 --> 00:02:35,988

00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:36,821
- Good.

68
00:02:39,147 --> 00:02:40,564
Heart of Te Fiti.

69
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:43,388
- [Jeremy] Jenae likes
the heart of Te Fiti.

70
00:02:43,388 --> 00:02:44,250
(Laura laughing)

71
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,221

107
00:04:18,987 --> 00:04:21,483
I don't even think she could smile.

of the year, Halloween night.

137
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,808
