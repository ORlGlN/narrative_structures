1
00:00:00,182 --> 00:00:03,776
- (singing) We just got a car!

2
00:00:03,776 --> 00:00:05,052
- Pulling up to the airport.

3
00:00:05,052 --> 00:00:06,929
(baby crying)

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:10,012
(funky guitar music)

5
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,803
(woman laughing)

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:18,874
Good morning.

7
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:22,027
We have had a frantic morning
getting ready to fly out

8
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:23,382
because we're flying out today.

9
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:24,872
We are going to Seattle
and we're gonna see

10
00:00:24,872 --> 00:00:26,226
my whole family for Thanksgiving.

11
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,285
So we've been packing and
hurrying to get everything done

12
00:00:28,285 --> 00:00:30,306
and poor Jeremy's had
a really rough morning.

13
00:00:30,306 --> 00:00:33,230
- My razor was set on a wrong setting

14
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:35,867
and I shaved my face and
so my beard is trimmed

15
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:39,119
and basically gone.
- It almost looks gone, yeah.

16
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,740
So it's like a bear-faced Jeremy

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,808
from like, three, years ago.

18
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,124
You'll have to go back to an earlier vlog

19
00:00:43,124 --> 00:00:45,109
and see what Jeremy used to
look like without a beard

20
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:46,179
and we're just not used to it.

21
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,912
So, who's excited to go to Seattle?

22
00:00:47,912 --> 00:00:49,315
- [All] Me!

23
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,208
- Thanks for using your quiet voices.

24
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,111
Janae finally just fell asleep in the car.

25
00:00:53,111 --> 00:00:54,601
This is the longest flight

26
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:56,950
that we will have ever
been on with our kids.

27
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,351
So I'm a little bit nervous.

28
00:00:58,351 --> 00:01:01,351
(jazzy piano music)

29
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,563
We're pulling up to the airport

30
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:07,592
and Jeremy looks at me, he's like,

31
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:09,525
"Are you ready for this?"

32
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:10,358
Game on.

33
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:15,001
Five kids, airplanes, rental cars, drives.

34
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:20,776
(rousing orchestral music)

35
00:01:26,832 --> 00:01:29,076
To Seattle we go!

36
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:31,104
So while Jeremy's dropping off the van

37
00:01:31,104 --> 00:01:32,552
and parking it in economy parking,

38
00:01:32,552 --> 00:01:33,870
I actually checked us all in.

39
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,320
I've never done that by myself before,

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,741
and it made me wonder, could I
fly with everybody by myself?

41
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:39,885
I think I could.

42
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,885
Do I want to?
Absolutely not.

43
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:43,694
Drop it off.
Wait for somebody Cubby, wait.

44
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:44,777
There you go.

45
00:01:46,124 --> 00:01:48,393
And the big one, the beast.

46
00:01:48,393 --> 00:01:49,590
You guys are awesome.

47
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,423
Go team.

48
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:51,812
'Kay, should we wait for Dad now?

49
00:01:51,812 --> 00:01:53,618
- [Caleb] Oh I see Seattle!

50
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:54,451
- [Kendra] You see Seattle?

51
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,026
'Kay, so which gate are we on?

52
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,145
- It's at B39.

53
00:01:57,145 --> 00:01:58,179
- [Kendra] B39?

54
00:01:58,179 --> 00:02:01,831
These kids are already
tired and we just arrived.

55
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:04,193
We have a long trip ahead of us.

56
00:02:04,193 --> 00:02:05,753
- Yeah, that's why we're resting.

57
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:07,509
- [Kendra] Oh, that's smart.

58
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:08,676
- [All] Daddy!

59
00:02:09,651 --> 00:02:10,895
(Kendra laughs)

60
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:12,632
- It's like they've been gone.

61
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:15,249
He was gone for like 15 minutes.

62
00:02:15,249 --> 00:02:17,423
(light marching music)

63
00:02:17,423 --> 00:02:18,742
Are you guys pregnant?

64
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:21,325
- No! (laughs)

65
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:26,232
- So I heard today on the
news that 51 million people,

66
00:02:26,232 --> 00:02:29,917
Americans, were traveling
today or tomorrow

67
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,693
with Thanksgiving coming up.

68
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:35,275
And I'm grateful that
the line isn't longer.

69
00:02:35,275 --> 00:02:36,565
- So Laura said she needs to go potty

70
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:38,301
right when we're in
the middle of security.

71
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:39,626
So there's nothing we
can really do except for

72
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,459
cross our fingers that she can hold it.

73
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,227
(light upbeat music)

74
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,962
- So we're cutting ahead for
Laura to go to the bathroom.

75
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:49,712
It's becoming urgent.

76
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,334
To the bathroom.

77
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:56,417
(light upbeat music)

78
00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:00,312
So they're doing like special checks of

79
00:03:00,312 --> 00:03:02,045
all of our bags almost,

80
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,818
so we're hoping to make
it to the gate on time.

81
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:05,729
We'll see.

82
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:09,151
It's taken significantly
longer than normal.

83
00:03:09,151 --> 00:03:10,830
- [Woman] Here you go, buddy.

84
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:13,220
(light string music)

85
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,871
- We made it just in time.

86
00:03:14,871 --> 00:03:16,740
- We wanted to be in the back
of the line that was our plan.

87
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,589
That way we're on the plane shorter.

88
00:03:19,589 --> 00:03:20,756
Time to board.

89
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,563
- [Jeremy] Go ahead, Elise.

90
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,624
- [Worker] Where's your tooth?

91
00:03:25,624 --> 00:03:27,234
Did the tooth fairy take it?

92
00:03:27,234 --> 00:03:28,594
- [Elise] Not yet.

93
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:29,897
- [Jeremy] Wait for us, Cub.

94
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,212
Here we go.

95
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:34,379
(upbeat string music)

96
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,445
Buckled in.

97
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,903
- Pikaboo!

98
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,203
Pikaboo!

99
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,877
Pikaboo!

100
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:50,304
- [Jeremy] So, Laura, how
you feeling about flying?

101
00:03:50,304 --> 00:03:51,291
- A little scared.

102
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,307
- [Jeremy] What are you scared of?

103
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:55,419
- That we're gonna land on our bum-bums.

104
00:03:55,419 --> 00:03:58,133
- [Jeremy] Land on our bum-bums?

105
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:59,216
Hopefully not.

106
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:01,314
Hopefully we land on the wheels.

107
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:03,044
- This airplane looks nice and big,

108
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:05,070
like the seats are wide.

109
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,468
It's gonna be a good flight.

110
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:08,700
Right? (laughs)

111
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,474
She's not so sure about it.

112
00:04:10,474 --> 00:04:14,266
(safety instructions playing)

113
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:15,779
- [Jeremy] Paying attention?

114
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:17,748
- Well I'm really relieved
there are a lot of families

115
00:04:17,748 --> 00:04:20,505
on this flight, and that makes
it so much less stressful.

116
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:21,778
Like, there's lots of kids,

117
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,594
and that will just be fun.

118
00:04:23,594 --> 00:04:26,427
(uplifting music)

119
00:04:30,092 --> 00:04:32,838
- Go faster, faster, fast!

120
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:36,255
- This is faster than 500 miles per hour.

121
00:04:37,223 --> 00:04:41,180
(Latin percussion music)

122
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,988
- The cars are so little
'cause we're in the air, Caleb.

123
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,071
(funky guitar music)

124
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:53,690
- I packed some fun things for the kids,

125
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,018
but they're not allowed to open them

126
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,971
until we're on the airplane in the air,

127
00:04:56,971 --> 00:04:58,792
so now they're excitedly
going through their bags

128
00:04:58,792 --> 00:04:59,956
and finding everything.

129
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:02,789
(soft rock music)

130
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,632
(babbling excitedly)

131
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:08,465
- [Jeremy] Yep.

132
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,346
- Is this a pen?

133
00:05:09,346 --> 00:05:10,763
- [Kendra] It is.

134
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:15,915
- Does this smell?

135
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,454
- [Kendra] Yeah.

136
00:05:17,454 --> 00:05:18,287
- Fidget!

137
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:20,061
Fidget spinner!

138
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:21,377
- [Jeremy] Fidget spinner!

139
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:24,210
(soft rock music)

140
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:31,776
- So, at the store yesterday,
I got one of these locks.

141
00:05:31,776 --> 00:05:33,474
My kids haven't used them before,

142
00:05:33,474 --> 00:05:35,791
and I told them that
anybody that breaks the code

143
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:37,235
gets a pack of M&Ms.

144
00:05:37,235 --> 00:05:39,425
So, the code's on the back.

145
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,600
They just have to figure
out how to open it.

146
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,600
So this is the code: oh one, 15, 33.

147
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:46,584
But you just have to figure out

148
00:05:46,584 --> 00:05:49,001
how to open it with the code.

149
00:05:50,353 --> 00:05:53,171
You're not gonna just break it open.

150
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,254
Try it again.

151
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:57,259
(laughs)

152
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,099
(smooth rock music)

153
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,084
To the back.

154
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:08,084
(smooth rock music)

155
00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,580
So Laura just wrote her
name for the first time.

156
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,080
We have an L-A-U, there's the R,

157
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:30,081
over here's another A.

158
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:32,581
- L-A-U-R-A.

159
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,785
- Oh, you did it!

160
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,648
You did it, youu unlocked it!

161
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,029
(relaxing string music)

162
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,454
- [Jeremy] You can see Seattle.

163
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:04,678
Isn't that pretty?

164
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:06,604
- That's where we are going?

165
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:08,265
- [Jeremy] Yep.

166
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:11,598
- Seattle is way further than I thought.

167
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:14,676
It has so many places.

168
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,183
Is Seattle a hotel?

169
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,233
- [Jeremy] No, Seattle is a city.

170
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,911
Kind of like Kansas City.

171
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:24,911
(light piano music)

172
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:32,803
Did we land?

173
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,724
(upbeat guitar music)

174
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:43,762
We're finally here.

175
00:07:43,762 --> 00:07:47,845
Now we have an hour and
a half drive ahead of us.

176
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:52,919
(singing) I'm falling so I'm
taking my time on my ride.

177
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:01,133
(singing) Oh, ohh, oh.

178
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:04,884
(singing) I'm taking my time on my ride.

179
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:07,974
(acoustic rock music)

180
00:08:07,974 --> 00:08:10,639
- [Jeremy] The mother goose
and her little chicks. (laughs)

181
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,806
(acoustic rock music)

182
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,862
- My breath has steam.

183
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:21,531
- [Jeremy] I think
that's 'cause it's cold.

184
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:22,962
- They never forget traveling.

185
00:08:22,962 --> 00:08:24,327
- Yeah.

186
00:08:24,327 --> 00:08:26,887
(murmurs quietly)

187
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,340
So we've been off the plane
for a little over 30 minutes,

188
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,768
and once we get our rental car,

189
00:08:30,768 --> 00:08:33,145
we have and hour and a half drive.

190
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,664
We're almost there.

191
00:08:34,664 --> 00:08:35,496
Kind of.

192
00:08:35,496 --> 00:08:37,468
(kids singing)

193
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:38,868
- Oh, we're here.

194
00:08:38,868 --> 00:08:42,558
- (singing) We just got a car!

195
00:08:42,558 --> 00:08:44,642
We just got a car-a-a-ar!

196
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:49,223
- In case you missed the
memo we just got a car.

197
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:52,342
It's a rental car, and
Laura's singing about it.

198
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:54,592
- We just got a car-a-a-ar!

199
00:08:57,326 --> 00:09:01,493
I don't want to be standing
here, the longest time.

200
00:09:02,778 --> 00:09:06,258
(Jeremy laughs)

201
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:07,134
- [Jeremy] (singing) But you have to

202
00:09:07,134 --> 00:09:10,604
'cause your car seat's not in yet.

203
00:09:10,604 --> 00:09:13,687
(cheery piano music)

204
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,768
- We're running into
traffic but it's all good

205
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,975
because NSYNC is on the radio. (laughs)

206
00:09:22,975 --> 00:09:24,779
So, we're enjoying it.

207
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:26,733
- Ah, look at this accident
though this is serious.

208
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,566
- Oh, no.

209
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,077
Oh my goodness.

210
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:34,100
It looks like everybody
was okay in that accident,

211
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,510
but that was scary.

212
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,586
(upbeat piano music)

213
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:39,588
Guys, look that's Seattle!

214
00:09:39,588 --> 00:09:40,613
Do you see it, Laura?

215
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:41,446
- [Laura] Yeah.

216
00:09:41,446 --> 00:09:42,687
- [Kendra] What do you think of Seattle?

217
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:44,126
- I like Seattle.

218
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,209
(upbeat piano music)

219
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:52,201
(kids wailing)

220
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:59,374
- So we have another trip
coming up in not too long

221
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:02,164
that we're trying to
decide if we should fly

222
00:10:02,164 --> 00:10:04,621
to that trip or drive.
(baby crying)

223
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:08,788
If we were to drive it would
be 20 hour drive or more.

224
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,603
A lot of driving.

225
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:14,856
(baby screaming)
We flew here.

226
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,171
It was a four hour flight,

227
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:20,202
and the worst part has been
this hour drive. (laughs)

228
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,276
So what do you think Jeremy?

229
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:23,051
Should we fly or drive?

230
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:25,854
- Let's just stay home.
(Kendra laughs)

231
00:10:25,854 --> 00:10:27,838
- Not a good time to
ask him that question.

232
00:10:27,838 --> 00:10:30,022
(babies crying and screaming)

233
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:33,322
- I love travelling.
(Kendra laughs)

234
00:10:33,322 --> 00:10:35,059
You know someday when I grow up,

235
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,652
I just wanna travel
the world with my kids,

236
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,831
and it'll be so fun.
(babies wailing)

237
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:40,777
- [Kendra] So what do you think Jeremy,

238
00:10:40,777 --> 00:10:42,320
should we have another baby?

239
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,686
(both laughing)

240
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,298
(jazzy piano music)

241
00:10:49,298 --> 00:10:52,002
- So this is reminding me
of the Thanksgiving song,

242
00:10:52,002 --> 00:10:53,536
Over the River and Through the Woods

243
00:10:53,536 --> 00:10:55,464
to Grandmother's House We Go.

244
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:56,625
We're going to Michael's house
- It's a Christmas.

245
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:57,792
- It's a Thanksgiving song.

246
00:10:57,792 --> 00:10:58,863
- [Jeremy] Okay, whatever.

247
00:10:58,863 --> 00:11:00,972
- Anywho, we're going through the woods.

248
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:02,700
I'm sure we went over some rivers,

249
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,997
which means we have to be getting close

250
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:04,958
to my brother's house soon.

251
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:06,349
- But there wasn't any traffic in that.

252
00:11:06,349 --> 00:11:08,151
- How could we do that?

253
00:11:08,151 --> 00:11:09,852
Over the river and through the woods,

254
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:12,010
through much much traffic we go.

255
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,605
The red brake lights ahead
of us show us the way

256
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:18,587
through the glistening, rainy-on road.

257
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:20,968
That didn't work, that
didn't work (laughs),

258
00:11:20,968 --> 00:11:22,437
that is not gonna work.

259
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:25,388
(light jazz music)

260
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:27,400
My brother's neighborhood is gorgeous

261
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,285
and the best news ever we see Papa!

262
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:32,244
(kids scream excitedly)
- It's Papa!

263
00:11:32,244 --> 00:11:34,066
- [Kendra] It's papa!

264
00:11:34,066 --> 00:11:34,899
- Papa!

265
00:11:36,122 --> 00:11:37,193
- [Papa] I know you.

266
00:11:37,193 --> 00:11:38,873
- [Jeremy] It's been an easy drive.

267
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,510
- [Kendra] Aww.

268
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,690
- [Papa] It's so good to see you.

269
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,598
- [Kendra] Lilly!

270
00:11:42,598 --> 00:11:43,536
Wait you're not Lilly.

271
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,935
- It's Jenna! (laughs)

272
00:11:46,935 --> 00:11:48,678
- [Kendra] You guys saying hi?

273
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,761
(excited chattering)

274
00:11:54,926 --> 00:11:55,827
- Ha!

275
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,533
I hadn't even seen you yet, give me a hug,

276
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:00,435
how are you?
- [Jeremy] Cousins.

277
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:02,018
- Nice work, buddy.

278
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:07,214
He looks taller, like
basically the same now.

279
00:12:07,214 --> 00:12:10,297
(excited chattering)

280
00:12:12,373 --> 00:12:14,880
- I'm so hungry, they have food for us.

281
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,938
Yes.

282
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:18,360
- [Kendra] So Jemma's a big fan of Jenae.

283
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,610
(laughing)

284
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:28,066
Oh, Jae likes it too. (laughs)

285
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:32,057
(laughing)
(background chattering)

286
00:12:32,057 --> 00:12:35,030
(Kendra laughing loudly)

287
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,530
So Jemma really likes babies.

288
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,150
- [Child] Goodnight, J-House out.

289
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,457
- Can our neighbors hear us?

290
00:12:41,457 --> 00:12:42,802
- [Jeremy] Pretty good.

291
00:12:42,802 --> 00:12:46,302
(upbeat electronic music)

292
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:50,007
There's our pallets.

293
00:12:50,007 --> 00:00:00,000
- We need a forklift.
