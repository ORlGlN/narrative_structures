1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,095
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:05,410
- Okay, I'm ready to take these things out

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:06,840
and see what happened to my head.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,050
Caleb, what you doing?

5
00:00:12,698 --> 00:00:15,281
(gentle music)

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,450
- Good morning.

7
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,831
School that our kids go to
one day a week got canceled

8
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:23,453
because of an ice storm.

9
00:00:23,453 --> 00:00:25,240
It's pretty serious.

10
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,990
They're saying maybe a
third of an inch of ice

11
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,650
from freezing rain is gonna come down

12
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,650
and cover everything.

13
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,450
So we're gearing up for a day at home,

14
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,030
hoping the power stays on.

15
00:00:37,944 --> 00:00:39,239
You're making the bed?

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,072
- Mm-hmm.

17
00:00:40,072 --> 00:00:41,656
- [Jeremy] So how are you guys
feeling about the ice storm?

18
00:00:41,656 --> 00:00:45,500
- I'm a little bit sad
because we can't go to school.

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,246
- [Jeremy] That is a bummer, huh?

20
00:00:47,246 --> 00:00:48,851
- I'm disappointed about it,

21
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:50,870
but I'm especially disappointed

22
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,320
that I can't go to basketball practice.

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,410
- [Jeremy] It's hard when
things get canceled, huh?

24
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:56,850
Well, hopefully it gets better soon.

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,700
But I think we can try
to have some fun here.

26
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,342
Why don't we do some
serious basketball practice

27
00:01:00,342 --> 00:01:01,230
at home?

28
00:01:02,458 --> 00:01:05,458
(peppy piano music)

29
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:13,840
- Ice storm warnings in place for all

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,080
of the counties shaded in purple.

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,680
That goes until six p.m.

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,990
- [Jeremy] Is that a telephone?

33
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,239
She loves the remote control.

34
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:21,654
Thanks for folding, Laura.

35
00:01:21,654 --> 00:01:24,654
(peppy piano music)

36
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:30,130
- I'm trying something
new with my hair today.

37
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,450
I've had these curlers for a while

38
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,530
and I've been wanting to try 'em

39
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,580
and see if it's an easier way

40
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,570
for me to curl my hair,
but you're supposed

41
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,580
to shower at night and put 'em in

42
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,820
and sleep in 'em and I just don't shower

43
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,560
at night very often, so
this morning I showered

44
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,020
and I was like, "I'm just gonna be home.

45
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,008
"I'm just gonna put 'em in."

46
00:01:42,008 --> 00:01:44,020
So we'll see how this turns out.

47
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:47,657
- Nae Nae's like, "What?"

48
00:01:47,657 --> 00:01:49,074
- Ooh, I like it.

49
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,690
- So curls will come down?

50
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,523
- Well, we'll see.

51
00:01:53,523 --> 00:01:55,160
When I take it out, it's supposed to be

52
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,372
that my hair dries like this.

53
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,322
Then when I take it out, there's curls.

54
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:00,445
What do you think?

55
00:02:00,445 --> 00:02:01,278
- I think it'll work.

56
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,111
- [Jen] Really?

57
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:04,050
- [Jeremy] It's a good day to do it.

58
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,223
No one's going anywhere today.

59
00:02:05,223 --> 00:02:06,470
- We're not going anywhere.

60
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,370
Do you wanna come see?

61
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,762
Does something seem a little different?

62
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,910
- [Jeremy] Did you do
something to your eyebrows?

63
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,441
- So before I ever had
kids, I would see children

64
00:02:14,441 --> 00:02:16,129
with crusty, disgusting noses

65
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,880
and inside I'd be like,
"Why don't their parents

66
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,095
"just wipe their kids' noses?"

67
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,430
And now I know.

68
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,110
Their parents already have
wiped their kids' noses

69
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,252
a hundred times that day.

70
00:02:24,252 --> 00:02:27,210
That's just how kids' noses go.

71
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,650
Hey, should we wipe that nose again?

72
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,160
So every time my kids
have disgusting noses,

73
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,193
it's a reminder to me not to judge.

74
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,223
- [Jeremy] It's her nap time.

75
00:02:34,223 --> 00:02:36,723
(piano music)

76
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,039
- I made my own ending in the song.

77
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,528
I just go back to this.

78
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:53,028
(piano music)

79
00:02:55,822 --> 00:02:57,515
- [Jen] I love listening to you play.

80
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:59,770
Caleb, what you doing?

81
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,310
- [Caleb] Trying to get the dirty clothes.

82
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,533
- [Jen] From the bottom of the hamper?

83
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:03,704
- [Caleb] Yeah.

84
00:03:03,704 --> 00:03:06,360
- [Jen] Well, you're gettin' it.

85
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,053
- Still more.

86
00:03:10,053 --> 00:03:10,886
- [Jen] Uh-oh.

87
00:03:10,886 --> 00:03:13,255
- My belly kinda hurts.

88
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:14,930
- [Jen] Yeah, that's rough.

89
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,465
Thank you for starting the laundry.

90
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:17,950
- [Caleb] Yep, mm-hmm.

91
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,100
- Should we turn it on?

92
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:24,974
(washer starting)

93
00:03:29,503 --> 00:03:30,394
Is the laundry going?

94
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,227
Uh-oh.

95
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,330
She is getting so tall.

96
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:41,150
Can you touch all those buttons?

97
00:03:42,883 --> 00:03:46,224
Oh, that was a step, good job, Nae Nae!

98
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:49,124
It still is really rare
for Janae to take steps

99
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:53,926
and so that was really
exciting for us, yay Nae Nae!

100
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:54,936
- Here's my name.

101
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,467
- [Jen] Did you write your name up here?

102
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,010
- [Laura] Yeah.

103
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,988
- [Jen] Wow.

104
00:03:59,988 --> 00:04:00,821
- [Laura] It's for windows.

105
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:01,830
- So I've been waiting for the right day

106
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,663
to bust these out.

107
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:05,530
These are window markers
and Laura and I had

108
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,131
a good talk about how these
are only for the window

109
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,058
because they're very special markers

110
00:04:09,058 --> 00:04:11,020
and they don't go on the wall

111
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,750
or on the door or on the table

112
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,120
or anywhere else, just the window,

113
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,646
so hopefully that works
out, but she's enjoying it

114
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,800
and it's pretty nice for
a cold weather activity

115
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,650
'cause we're staying inside
but it's something new to do.

116
00:04:26,994 --> 00:04:29,530
I just came outside 'cause
I thought it would be cute

117
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,380
to film Laura from the outside

118
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,470
and it is so cold and icy out here

119
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,303
and I'm in bare feet,

120
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:37,090
so that was a really silly idea.

121
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,230
No, no.

122
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:40,170
We are staying inside today.

123
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,259
- It's time for school lunch.

124
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,389
- [Jeremy] So yesterday
we prepared their lunches

125
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,890
for school, but they're
not going today, so.

126
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,223
- I got a snack!

127
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:52,197
Oh, I got a snack!

128
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,254
Look what I got, I'm cool.

129
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,860
- So when you were about our kids' age

130
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,140
when you went to school,
did you bring a lunch

131
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,290
or did you get lunch from a cafeteria?

132
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,960
Let us know in the poll.

133
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,944
- Okay, I'm ready to take these things out

134
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,345
and see what happened to my head.

135
00:05:09,345 --> 00:05:11,845
(peppy music)

136
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:19,160
I don't know exactly what I think of it.

137
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,460
Some of the curls turned out great

138
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,728
and some of 'em just really didn't.

139
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:25,220
And then I got this kink
to have to deal with,

140
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,110
which I'm sure is just
learning how to do it better,

141
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:29,850
but it's fun to try something new.

142
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,550
I think I'm gonna have to
fix it up a little bit here.

143
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,690
I'm using my straightener to try to get

144
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,360
that awkward kink out

145
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,980
and then I'm gonna use my curling wand

146
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,920
to try to put a little bit more curl in.

147
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,340
What's nice is the bottom layers

148
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,380
already have quite a bit of wave to them,

149
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,880
and so I'm only really
having to do the top layer.

150
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,430
Well, I touched it up with my curling wand

151
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,119
and now I think it's almost
a little bit too curly.

152
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,905
I just can't figure out
how to do those big,

153
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:02,770
loose, gentle waves, and I'm trying,

154
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,930
so you know what?

155
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,280
It's fun to try new things

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,560
and it's not always gonna work out.

157
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,610
And luckily I'm not going anywhere today,

158
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,609
so it doesn't really matter.

159
00:06:09,609 --> 00:06:12,192
(bright music)

160
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,362
- So last night we
ordered online groceries

161
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,898
from our local grocery store

162
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,740
and they're supposed to be arriving

163
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,230
some time in this next hour.

164
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,473
Nobody is driving, everything is closed.

165
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,970
We'll see if they end up coming,

166
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,880
but we want to clear the steps

167
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,080
so that it's not so crazy dangerous icy

168
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,913
if they do come.

169
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:45,960
Well, it's really coming down right now.

170
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,520
This freezing rain is intense.

171
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,398
It's cold, but it's beautiful.

172
00:06:49,398 --> 00:06:53,060
The way that it covers
everything is really neat.

173
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,873
So yesterday I put a letter in the mailbox

174
00:07:08,873 --> 00:07:11,530
that needed to be picked
up by the mailman,

175
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:12,990
but I forgot to lift the flag,

176
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,610
and it is hard to break through the ice

177
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,250
to get the flag up, and
I think I cut myself.

178
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,832
What's that?

179
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:21,983
- A yellow nine.

180
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,140
- Good job.

181
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,176
She forgot what the nine
was last time we did it,

182
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:26,703
but this time she remembered.

183
00:07:26,703 --> 00:07:31,703
Sometimes it helps to sing
while you're doing it.

184
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,073
Laura, how's your smoothie?

185
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:37,230
- Good and really colder
than anybody else's.

186
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,140
- [Jeremy] It is cold.

187
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,540
- [Jen] So I'm cooking myself some eggs.

188
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,536
And apparently Janae wants some.

189
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:43,852
Janae, do you want some eggs?

190
00:07:43,852 --> 00:07:45,971
- She likes eggs.

191
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:46,860
- She does?

192
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,200
Janae has taken a few steps today,

193
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,311
and so we're practicing with her.

194
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:51,311
Go to Daddy.

195
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,200
- She walks better to you.

196
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,076
I think it's more exciting to go to Mom.

197
00:07:57,076 --> 00:07:59,182
(cheering)

198
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:00,515
- Walk to Daddy.

199
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:05,815
(cheering)

200
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:07,620
So it's quiet time right now

201
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,982
and everybody's doing
great except one person.

202
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:12,870
(babbling)

203
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,616
Do you not want to take a nap?

204
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:16,330
Are you not tired?

205
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,270
It's nap time.

206
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,668
Are you ready to go?

207
00:08:18,668 --> 00:08:20,486
We got teddy, we're ready to go.

208
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:22,232
I'm a big believer in quiet time.

209
00:08:22,232 --> 00:08:24,030
I feel like it's great for kids

210
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,594
and they can play alone
and use their imagination

211
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,370
and just kind of have down time

212
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,360
in the middle of the day.

213
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,540
I think it's great for parents.

214
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,039
I really love quiet time,

215
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,299
and I was able to make the schedules work

216
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,499
when I had one kid and
two kids and three kids

217
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,183
and four kids, but with five kids,

218
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,846
I have not figured out how
to sync all the schedules

219
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:44,620
so that I can still get that quiet time.

220
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,123
So some days I'm like
I should just give up

221
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:48,300
and never try,

222
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,178
but it still is nice when the big kids are

223
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:52,350
having their quiet time and able

224
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,601
to kind of recharge and play.

225
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:55,993
- We may not be in San Diego anymore

226
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,850
where we did have that amazing view,

227
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:01,012
but tonight's sunset is beautiful.

228
00:09:01,012 --> 00:09:02,776
The camera just doesn't quite capture

229
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:05,230
how bright it is out there.

230
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,883
- Our groceries made it.

231
00:09:06,883 --> 00:09:08,960
I am so grateful that I did not have

232
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,068
to go out shopping in this storm.

233
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:12,070
Thanks for carrying that up, buddy.

234
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,041
All right, guys, let's start unloading.

235
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,541
(peppy music)

236
00:09:19,172 --> 00:09:20,367
- I love that!

237
00:09:20,367 --> 00:09:21,441
- [Jen] What is it?

238
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:24,877
- It's, let me show you.

239
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:25,710
- Cottage cheese?

240
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,680
- Yeah, I like cottage cheese.

241
00:09:28,454 --> 00:09:30,840
- [Jen] Well, we got some.

242
00:09:31,932 --> 00:09:32,849
- Po-ta-to.

243
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,310
- Potatoes.

244
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,240
So I was craving cornbread today

245
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,190
because we eat the best cornbread.

246
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,360
It's basically like cake.

247
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,868
So it's like hmm, what
can I make for dinner

248
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:44,010
that will justify eating
cornbread with it?

249
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,330
So we are having chili
and delicious cornbread,

250
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,080
which actually works with an ice storm.

251
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,182
It feels nice and cozy.

252
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:54,140
- Uh-huh for the best mom ever, uh-huh.

253
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,283
- [Jen] I don't know what that was.

254
00:09:55,283 --> 00:09:56,820
- All right, let's say a prayer.

255
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,492
- So Janae has been practicing
walking a bunch today

256
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:03,835
and she's made a ton of progress.

257
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,808
- [Jeremy] Tonight she
walked from this edge

258
00:10:05,808 --> 00:10:07,739
of this couch all the way over to here.

259
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:11,030
- She's taking like six steps at a time.

260
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,660
Oh, she goes wherever she wants.

261
00:10:14,567 --> 00:10:15,491
(cheering)

262
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,741
(babbling)

263
00:10:18,796 --> 00:10:21,046
(laughter)

264
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,330
- [Jeremy] Little squat practice.

265
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:27,113
Headstand.

266
00:10:27,113 --> 00:10:29,363
(laughter)

267
00:10:35,292 --> 00:10:36,660
There it was.

268
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,254
- And so we had to run.

269
00:10:38,254 --> 00:10:39,954
And there it was trying to get us.

270
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:45,750
- [Jen] Whoa, what are you?

271
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,630
- This is Caleb.

272
00:10:47,643 --> 00:00:00,000
- I found two shirts that I like.
