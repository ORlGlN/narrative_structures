1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,980
- Good morning.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,980
Alright so I've got a
little pimple right there.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,528
Trying to decide if I
should pop it or not.

4
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:14,388
Normally I do but I don't
know that that always helps.

5
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:16,818
Cause then like, 30 minutes later

6
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:19,068
it'll still be pestulating.

7
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:21,990
And I'll be at a meeting or something.

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,089
Anyway, so I think I'm going
to try to just leave it.

9
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:26,369
And I know that that's annoying.

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,530
People are going to
look at it and be like,

11
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,430
"I want to pop it."

12
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,432
Are you one of those people where you like

13
00:00:29,432 --> 00:00:31,958
want to pop other people?

14
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:32,891
Anyway.

15
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,880
So, sorry about that.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,191
It's there today.

17
00:00:36,191 --> 00:00:39,030
Hopefully it goes away soon.

18
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,613
(upbeat music)

19
00:01:06,261 --> 00:01:10,261
(children giggling and playing)

20
00:01:19,772 --> 00:01:22,522
- We're doing the jump challenge.

21
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,302
- I don't know what they're
doing downstairs but I guess

22
00:01:30,302 --> 00:01:33,052
they're doing the jump challenge.

23
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:39,489
(upbeat hip-hop music)
(children shouting)

24
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:00,772
He hit his head really hard.

25
00:02:00,772 --> 00:02:01,764
Like, I could hear that.

26
00:02:01,764 --> 00:02:04,507
But he's just laughing so
we're just going to go with it.

27
00:02:04,507 --> 00:02:07,137
We'll check his pupils afterwards.

28
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:10,354
We have been chatting for over an hour.

29
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,615
Because these guys are awesome

30
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,447
with the Canadian Family Vlog.

31
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:14,280
There it is.

32
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,605
- And then you guys are just like.

33
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,030
(laughing)

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,764
- Yes, you guys should go to
their channel, they're awesome.

35
00:02:20,764 --> 00:02:22,936
We love the Canadian Family Vlog.

36
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:23,896
- Just what you all wanted,

37
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:26,506
an update on Jeremy's adult acne.

38
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:27,675
(laughing)

39
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:29,714
- I thought when I grew up
the pimples would go away.

40
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:32,717
- Sweetheart, but your
hormones didn't go away either.

41
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,073
(smooching)
- That's for sure.

42
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,155
(laughing)

43
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:35,988
- Take good care of it.

44
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,884
Aw, I didn't think we were in the camera.

45
00:02:37,884 --> 00:02:38,847
- Kendra and her filling.

46
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:40,377
(laughing)

47
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:41,906
Hey you guys.

48
00:02:41,906 --> 00:02:44,054
- Alright so the topic
of discussion tonight is.

49
00:02:44,054 --> 00:02:47,076
- Should we have another baby?

50
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:48,855
- It's honestly something
we're really talking about.

51
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:52,123
Our kids are all about two years apart.

52
00:02:52,123 --> 00:02:54,404
And so, when a baby turns
one, is when we talk about

53
00:02:54,404 --> 00:02:55,705
"Hey, should we have another baby?"

54
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:57,594
And so far the answer's always been, yes!

55
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:02,044
And Laura's getting older,
she's like 10 months old.

56
00:03:02,044 --> 00:03:05,524
- Okay, I'm honestly a little bit scared.

57
00:03:05,524 --> 00:03:07,681
Like it's so overwhelming, and.

58
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:09,462
- Our four keep us very busy.

59
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:10,922
- You know you have the
little babies and then,

60
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,003
but they keep getting bigger and older,

61
00:03:13,003 --> 00:03:16,603
and complex issues and
I'm just nervous about

62
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:18,054
getting in over our head.

63
00:03:18,054 --> 00:03:19,972
We both are really close to our siblings.

64
00:03:19,972 --> 00:03:21,702
And they're some of our best friends.

65
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,403
And we want to give that to our kids.

66
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:24,952
- And we both come from big families.

67
00:03:24,952 --> 00:03:26,184
So I come from a family of four,

68
00:03:26,184 --> 00:03:29,484
he comes from a family of six or 18.

69
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:31,153
- That's not a joke.

70
00:03:31,153 --> 00:03:33,152
I'll tell you about it another time soon.

71
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:34,192
(laughing)

72
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,401
- So, we both come from big families.

73
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:37,942
Like when we were dating
and engaged, it was like

74
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:39,232
oh we're going to have a big family.

75
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,453
I think we both figured like
six, eight, something big.

76
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:42,830
- Yeah I always was like,

77
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,832
"Why would I have less than six kids?"

78
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:47,120
and it's funny now you know,
growing up and having my own

79
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,422
it's like, "Maybe four
is a really good number."

80
00:03:50,422 --> 00:03:53,171
- We have two boys, two
girls, it's perfect.

81
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,401
And we love them, like they're so fun.

82
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:58,634
And they also exhaust us.

83
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:00,744
- Since we've has Isaac,
so that was six years ago.

84
00:04:00,744 --> 00:04:03,553
- There hasn't been a break
in nursing and pregnancy and,

85
00:04:03,553 --> 00:04:05,002
- Diapers.
- We've had two in diapers

86
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:05,951
over and over again.
- You know,

87
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:07,152
putting into the car seats.

88
00:04:07,152 --> 00:04:09,454
And again, we really aren't
wanting sound complaining.

89
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:10,582
- We're go grateful for our kids.

90
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,770
- We struggled with
infertility for a couple years

91
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,962
before having Isaac.

92
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,594
And so we realize that
any time you have a baby

93
00:04:16,594 --> 00:04:17,863
it's beautiful.
- And our kids are

94
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:18,754
such a wonderful blessing.

95
00:04:18,754 --> 00:04:21,613
- I just want to make sure than
I can coach each of my kids

96
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:23,473
and have enough one-on-one time.

97
00:04:23,473 --> 00:04:25,902
And so making a decision for
what's best for the family

98
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:28,872
is tough because any time you
bring a child into the family

99
00:04:28,872 --> 00:04:29,914
it seems like that.
- It's a big blessing

100
00:04:29,914 --> 00:04:31,194
like it's going to be,
- A miracle.

101
00:04:31,194 --> 00:04:32,123
- a great thing.

102
00:04:32,123 --> 00:04:33,582
- But,
- We also want to be really

103
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:34,633
deliberate about it.
- I don't want to take away

104
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:35,632
from the other kids.

105
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:37,272
- Doesn't it also sound like so much fun

106
00:04:37,272 --> 00:04:38,971
to have another little tiny one

107
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,981
that just, like lays on your shoulder

108
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:41,822
and is so cute?
- But that little tiny one

109
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:44,342
could grow up to be a Caleb.

110
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:46,211
- So I have, we love Caleb by the way.

111
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:49,601
- But the baby could turn into a Caleb.

112
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,282
(laughing)

113
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,483
- So adorableness.

114
00:04:52,483 --> 00:04:53,316
That's what you're scared of.

115
00:04:53,316 --> 00:04:54,373
You are frightened by adorableness.

116
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:56,982
So we want to make sure that each child,

117
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:59,550
like we're able to not only
fulfill their physical needs,

118
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,382
but their spiritual and emotional needs.

119
00:05:01,382 --> 00:05:03,491
And make sure that they
have the one-on-one time

120
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,740
that they need with us.

121
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,201
- Well and our marriage
to make sure that it's

122
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,560
not being, you know.

123
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,393
- Stretched so thin.

124
00:05:08,393 --> 00:05:10,561
- And what our family
goals are and our dreams

125
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:13,795
of what it is we want
to do with our family.

126
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:14,628
- There's so much to consider.

127
00:05:14,628 --> 00:05:15,574
- So much to consider.

128
00:05:15,574 --> 00:05:17,214
- Like really up until
this point it's been like,

129
00:05:17,214 --> 00:05:18,326
"Yeah we want to have another baby,

130
00:05:18,326 --> 00:05:19,405
"we want to have another baby."

131
00:05:19,405 --> 00:05:21,306
And I love babies.

132
00:05:21,306 --> 00:05:23,154
I'm like permanently baby-hungry.

133
00:05:23,154 --> 00:05:24,755
Obviously it's going to
come down to a decision

134
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:25,814
between Jeremy and I.

135
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:28,816
And a prayerful decision that we feel like

136
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:30,365
God knows what's best for our family.

137
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:32,168
And that's why, like,
we totally don't judge.

138
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:34,438
Like you have one kid, you
have 20 kids, that's awesome.

139
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,336
That's great, we're just
trying to figure out

140
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,484
what's right for our family.

141
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:39,156
And we honestly don't know

142
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,786
what's right for our family right now.

143
00:05:40,786 --> 00:05:42,286
- Yeah, so we'll be thinking about it,

144
00:05:42,286 --> 00:05:44,167
and discussing it and praying about it.

145
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,334
And we'll keep you posted.

146
00:05:47,956 --> 00:00:00,000
(light inspirational music)
