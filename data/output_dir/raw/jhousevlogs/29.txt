1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,340
- We don't if that
means we're moving soon?

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,970
If we found the right place, we could.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:06,290
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,228
What do you think is inside the box?

5
00:00:08,228 --> 00:00:10,510
♪ Oo-Oo-Oo ♪

6
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:11,450
- What'd ya find?

7
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:13,000
I forgot the Jell-O salad.

8
00:00:17,277 --> 00:00:18,110
- So the girls and I are out

9
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,440
doing something interesting today.

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,780
We are looking at houses with a realtor.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,190
I don't exactly know what that means

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,100
so I don't know exactly
what to tell you guys.

13
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,640
We're feeling like it's time for us

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,320
to start looking at some other homes

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,770
and kind of getting a better picture

16
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,330
of what we want in our future.

17
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:34,460
We don't know if that
means we're moving soon;

18
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,284
if we found the right place we could.

19
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,800
We just honestly don't know.

20
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,210
We just feel like it's time for us

21
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,450
to be thinking about
what are next step is.

22
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,038
And so, yeah, we're gonna
look at some houses today.

23
00:00:45,038 --> 00:00:47,455
(soft music)

24
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:51,630
So we're looking at a
variety of homes today.

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,270
We're looking at some new
construction, we're looking

26
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,280
at some older homes on more acreage.

27
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,730
And I'm just trying to figure
out what exactly we want.

28
00:01:03,858 --> 00:01:06,775
(soft flute music)

29
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:09,450
- [Dad] What are you doin' buddy?

30
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,750
- I'm tryin' to find
what kinda bird this is.

31
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:14,250
- It's been so fun to have
that bird-feeder there.

32
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:15,869
Do you think you found
what kinda bird it was?

33
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,619
- A Smith's Longspur.

34
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:20,160
- [Dad] Yeah, it does look like it.

35
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,993
Hey, look up and see if
(toddler screams)

36
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,780
that kind of bird is in this area.

37
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,050
- That one eating is a
male common Yellowthroat.

38
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,010
- [Dad] What's this
that you have goin' on?

39
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:34,660
- It's a fort that I read in and can look.

40
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,900
I found there nest because they build it

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,320
with dry weeds, grass and leaves.

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,100
That's it right there.

43
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,170
- [Dad] So there's a
woodpecker trained to peck in.

44
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,010
It's tryin' to break in.

45
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,550
The seeds are right there buddy.

46
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,280
- Oh, we see him.

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,840
- [Jeremy] He's actually pecking in.

48
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,673
- I love this.

49
00:01:52,824 --> 00:01:54,219
It's like my favorite.

50
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,581
- Oh look the little chickadees
are just right there eating.

51
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:59,164
(upbeat music)

52
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:03,090
- So Janae has been
sick, she's had a fever.

53
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,020
And last night the
scariest thing happened.

54
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,800
At 3:00 a.m. she woke up

55
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,650
screaming like she was in really bad pain.

56
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,920
She was arching her back
and she wouldn't be soothed.

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,840
For 20 minutes we tried: she
wouldn't nurse with Kendra,

58
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,010
she wouldn't stop crying.

59
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,250
And it got to the point
where we were so unsure

60
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,800
of what was happening
and not able to help her

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,670
that we drove to the ER.

62
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,430
Right before we were going into the ER,

63
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,320
and this was just Kendra
with her, I was home

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,660
with the kids sleeping.

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,170
She finally calmed down.

66
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,840
And Kendra decided to bring
her home and we were then

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
able to nurse her and
get her back to sleep

68
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,520
about an hour later.

69
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,227
But it is just so scary to see your baby

70
00:02:36,227 --> 00:02:38,780
hurting like that and not
knowing how to fix it.

71
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,200
And feeling out of control.

72
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,910
And it just made me hold her different

73
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,010
and think differently about
how precious she is to me.

74
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,240
She just wants to go jump
on the tramp with the kids.

75
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,540
It's really warm right now, we're up

76
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,190
to 65 degrees right now.

77
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,220
- I'm making Jell-O salad for
the blue and gold banquet.

78
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,803
(upbeat music)

79
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:08,920
- [Dad] So what flavors are you making?

80
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,420
- Strawberry, banana, and berry blue.

81
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,125
Some people will think it's great.

82
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:17,292
- [Jeremy] They're gonna be surprised.

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,060
This will cool it off quicker.

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,470
So Kendra hasn't seen my law office.

85
00:03:36,391 --> 00:03:37,878
- It's a cool office.

86
00:03:37,878 --> 00:03:39,030
- [Jeremy] This is our office.

87
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,150
Uncle Brant's here.
- Best.

88
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,900
- We just got somethin' in the mail

89
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,280
that we're excited to open up

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,360
because we think we know what it is.

91
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,450
Our you excited?
(baby moans softly)

92
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,960
Yeah, you're super excited.

93
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:55,740
(Laura screams)

94
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,340
You're just excited because it's a box.

95
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,746
- Yes.

96
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:00,240
- [Kendra] What do you
think is inside the box?

97
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,110
- I don't know.

98
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,890
- [Kendra] Give it a
guess, what do you think?

99
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:04,372
- The walking animal.

100
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:05,500
- [Kendra] Oh a walking animal?

101
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,810
That would be a pretty exciting box.

102
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,089
- I think it's like a reward from YouTube.

103
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:12,130
- [Kendra] Ooh!

104
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,253
I think you know.

105
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,086
- I do.

106
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:16,062
- Who wants to help me open up it?

107
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:17,190
- [Kids In Unison] Me.

108
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,005
- Do you guys know what it is?

109
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:20,672
NaeNae doesn't know.

110
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:26,922
- See what it is.

111
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,410
- [Kendra] It's a box.

112
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,473
- You guys ready.

113
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35,055
- [Kids In Unison] Uh-huh, yes.

114
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:38,095
♪ Shh-Oo-Oo-Oo ♪

115
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:40,167
(laughing)

116
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:43,197
♪ Oo-Oo-Oo ♪

117
00:04:43,197 --> 00:04:44,957
- [Kids In Unison] Yeah.

118
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,654
- The Gold Play Button.

119
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:47,487
- Yeah.

120
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:50,903
- [Kendra] Do you know what it is?

121
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:52,108
What's a Gold Play Button?

122
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:54,431
- It's like an iPad, you play on it.

123
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,565
(laughing)

124
00:04:56,565 --> 00:04:57,398
- Wow.

125
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:01,203
Look at this you guys.

126
00:05:01,203 --> 00:05:02,514
- Can I touch it?

127
00:05:02,514 --> 00:05:03,347
- [Kendra] There it is.

128
00:05:03,347 --> 00:05:04,280
- [Child] Is it actually gold?

129
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,770
- J House Vlogs.

130
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,250
Congratulations on passing
one million subscribers.

131
00:05:10,197 --> 00:05:11,220
- Wow.

132
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,053
- Wow.

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,909
(family laughs)
- You can see yourself.

134
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,610
It's a mirror, it's like
the fun house mirror.

135
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,920
- My face is a triangle.

136
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,753
- [Jeremy] They thought we would use this

137
00:05:21,753 --> 00:05:22,710
as an art decoration.

138
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,646
- [Isaac] It only works if you're moving.

139
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:27,660
(animated monster sounds)

140
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,840
- So getting the Gold
Play Button, it reminds me

141
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,080
a lot of the milestones
along our YouTube journey.

142
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,663
(upbeat music)

143
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:39,903
(laughing)

144
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,258
- Happy one thousand subscribe (laughs).

145
00:05:50,023 --> 00:05:52,224
- [Family in Unison] 5,000.

146
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:55,474
(Family member shouts)

147
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,700
- And to celebrate 20,000
subscribers we want you

148
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,730
on J House Vlogs.

149
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,034
- [Family In Unison] Thank you.

150
00:06:03,034 --> 00:06:05,273
(screams of enjoyment)

151
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:08,340
- We decided that we wanted
to try to do 150 candles.

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,840
- It's so exciting that
today, on my birthday, we have

153
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,510
hit a huge milestone.

154
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,720
We decided today to celebrate.

155
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,710
By getting 500 food items

156
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:23,290
that we could take to the local food bank.

157
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,750
To share with those in the community

158
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,890
who are in need of food.

159
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,460
And then of course this
reminds me of when we

160
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,840
did the million subscribers
service celebration,

161
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,980
not too long ago.

162
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,950
That was just an amazing experience

163
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,510
of meeting so many of you.

164
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,990
This is a milestone in our
family and in our journey

165
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,310
that wouldn't be possible
without each one of you.

166
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,260
We love you, we appreciate you.

167
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,730
And thank you for coming
along with our family

168
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,810
on this journey.

169
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,330
And I'm excited for what lies ahead.

170
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,310
We know that this milestone
wouldn't be possible

171
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,410
without each one of you.

172
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,430
So thank you for coming
along for this journey

173
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,106
with our family; and we're excited about

174
00:06:54,106 --> 00:06:55,530
what lies ahead.

175
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,504
- Somehow it changed from like really cold

176
00:06:58,504 --> 00:07:00,710
to really warm.

177
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,880
So it's like the perfect amount of degrees

178
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,760
to go out far in the woods.

179
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,860
- [Jeremy] Let's go exploring.

180
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:08,693
- [Caleb] Yeah.

181
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,900
- So a lot of times in the
wooded area here, there's

182
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,540
a lot of ticks and bugs, but
since we're in the middle

183
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,950
of winter and it's warm we
can go exploring in here,

184
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,688
without all the bugs.

185
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,271
(fiddle music)

186
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,110
- I find all the stuff
we don't use anymore.

187
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,770
- I love exploring with our kids.

188
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,397
Look the water is frozen down there still.

189
00:07:37,397 --> 00:07:39,271
You wanna go ice skating on the creek?

190
00:07:39,271 --> 00:07:40,104
- Yeah.

191
00:07:40,104 --> 00:07:40,937
- [Jeremy] Just kidding,
I don't think we can

192
00:07:40,937 --> 00:07:43,280
but we can try to find a way down there.

193
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,752
It's standing alright Caleb?

194
00:07:44,752 --> 00:07:47,002
- [Caleb] It's gonna break.

195
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,401
- [Jeremy] What'd ya find?

196
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:53,234
- [Kids in Unison] Fort.

197
00:07:53,234 --> 00:07:55,090
- The fort we found.

198
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:55,980
- [Jeremy] Wow.

199
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,813
- [Caleb] Can we go in?

200
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:57,840
- [Jeremy] Yeah, go ahead.

201
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,980
Yeah, there's animals out here.

202
00:08:03,957 --> 00:08:06,707
(animated music)

203
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,962
- I love exploring because
you get an adventure

204
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:19,150
and find new things.

205
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,960
It's amazing how sometimes
the best adventures

206
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,670
are right in your backyard or beyond

207
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,427
the fence of your backyard.

208
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,130
- Can we keep going?

209
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,090
- [Jeremy] You wanna keep exploring?

210
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,923
- Yeah.

211
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:29,756
- [Jeremy] We probably better go back.

212
00:08:29,756 --> 00:08:31,750
We're going to Isaac's blue
and gold banquet tonight.

213
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,200
- Ooh, let's get back.

214
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,499
- But we can hear Laura
belting out tomorrow

215
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,246
at the top of her lungs.

216
00:08:38,246 --> 00:08:40,913
(ball bouncing)

217
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,890
- [Kendra] Gettin' some breakfast in.

218
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,546
- [Jeremy] So Elise, where
are you heading tonight?

219
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:47,379
- To ballet.

220
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:48,212
- [Jeremy] It's been a while

221
00:08:48,212 --> 00:08:49,045
since you've been to ballet, eh?

222
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:50,633
- Do you wanna stand up?

223
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:51,614
- [Jeremy] Yeah.

224
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,906
- Stand up and practice.

225
00:08:52,906 --> 00:08:56,042
(baby mumbles sounds)

226
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,214
- [Jeremy] She likes practicing walking.

227
00:08:58,214 --> 00:08:59,885
Oop, she's like I just wanna crawl.

228
00:08:59,885 --> 00:09:01,250
- I learned of a spin

229
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,660
that my teacher hasn't taught me yet.

230
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,110
- [Jeremy] 'Kay let's see it.

231
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,590
Whoa.

232
00:09:10,587 --> 00:09:11,980
(laughter)

233
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,067
- She was right behind me.

234
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,690
- I'm crazy.

235
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,523
- [Kendra] Yeah you are.

236
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,600
- You are too.

237
00:09:19,176 --> 00:09:21,363
- [Kendra] What are we making?

238
00:09:21,363 --> 00:09:24,360
- Food frost and (mumbles).

239
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,670
- So we made some chicken
taquitos, some rice and some corn

240
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,880
and we're taking it to a family
that we're good friends with

241
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,600
and their mom just went through surgery.

242
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,040
So we're gonna cook 'em
dinner and it smells so good.

243
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,480
And we are snacking on tortilla chips.

244
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,673
Yum-de-de-yum.

245
00:09:38,673 --> 00:09:40,282
- Yummy.

246
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:42,865
(upbeat music)

247
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:48,900
- Na, Na, Na.

248
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,120
- [Jeremy] Those are bracelets?

249
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,670
So we came for the blue and gold banquet

250
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,580
and I forgot the Jell-O salad.

251
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,382
So we're gonna go to get that.

252
00:09:55,382 --> 00:09:56,430
- Is it at home?

253
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,197
- [Jeremy] It's at home.

254
00:09:58,197 --> 00:10:00,780
(upbeat music)

255
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:05,910
Alright let's do this.

256
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,820
- So I just gotta text
from my brother Michael

257
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,390
that my sister-in-law is in labor

258
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,140
and I am so excited for them.

259
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,650
They're having a little boy and that means

260
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,400
that some time tonight,
hopefully, the baby will be born

261
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,550
and I just can't wait.

262
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,810
This reminds me of so much of last year

263
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,960
about this time when I was
getting ready to have Janae.

264
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,600
And babies are just so precious.

265
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,670
I can't wait to see a
little picture of him

266
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,040
and hear his name and updates.

267
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,750
Anyway, that's what I'm
thinking about tonight.

268
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,930
Goodnight, J House out.

269
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,860
So I put Janae in shoes
for the first time.

270
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,577
- Today I'm getting baptized.

271
00:10:45,577 --> 00:00:00,000
- 10 up. Whoa!
